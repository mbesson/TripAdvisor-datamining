Food in the restaurant was very good too -- they even went off menu on my last day and served me key lime pie for breakfast. The one caveat, as someone else has noted, is the cruise ship problem. We awoke one morning to find a huge ship entirely blocking our view. Not only could we not see the water but it was uncomfortable to sit on the balcony facing the ship windows. Take this warning more seriously than I did and contact the hotel in advance to insist on a room that won't be blocked even if there are 3 ships in port.

And it is in some areas but needs work in others. First the good...the staff, with the exception of the evening receptionist, were fantastic. There's a fabulous view for many of the rooms. The rooms themselves were enormous and beautiful. And the food is wonderful (though I didn't eat from Hot Tin Roof, only room service and the pool.) Here's the areas where they need work...for the price that this hotel is, someone should be greeting you at your car, instead of you intuitively knowing that you should leave your car at valet, walk away from it, go check in, and then they'll send someone back out with you to get your bags. They should be opening your door for you - that's how it's been every other place I've ever been in this price category (and even much lower.) This isn't a Holiday Inn. The internet is TERRIBLE. Truly. It's wireless but it's not secured so people can wander around near the hotel and use it and it drops CONSTANTLY. The only time it worked was on Sunday night/Monday morning. Otherwise it's not enough bandwidth for the number of customers. They should be using a hotel password or use wired internet vice wireless. Cruise ships do block your view. This happened my last morning so I was thrilled I was checking out. If more than one cruise ship docks at Mallory Square, the second one is directly in your way - so all you see is people looking into your room and the parking lot at Mallory Square - the Oceanview is entirely blocked until the ship leaves, usually around or after sunset. The pool is very small. The rooms facing the ocean and Mallory Square can be loud - you can block most of the noise out by closing your balcony off. This hotel is at the very end of Duval - which is nice in that there's not alot of riff raff in front of the hotel - but it's at least a block to anything going on, including restaurants except those in the hotel itself. So for the exorbitant price I paid, I'm not sure I got my money's worth.", "Date": "March 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fort Lauderdale, Florida", "Title": "\u201cThis hotel is the place to be!\u201d", "Author": "lolotraveler", "ReviewID": "UR126161917", "Content": "Our first time to Key West and we booked last minute so there were slim pickin's on the hotel choices.

I read so many reviews on tripadvisor and looked in Conde Nast and Travel and Leisure magazines to find the ideal place to stay and this hotel seemed to be the perfect place but we were so disppointed. We got there early and our room was not ready, which was totally fine, so they took our cell phone number and said they would call us when the room was ready. My husband and I went and explored the town for hours and never received a call so eventually re returned back to the hotel several hours later. The concierge, who was amazing (I think her name was Oksana) has gotten us an upgrade to a two bedroom waterfront suite which was wonderful. We were shown to our room and it honestly looked as if they had never vacuumed the floors and carpet. There was a large hot tub in the room and there were hairs in the bottom which really turned my stomach. At $369 a night, I had much higher expectations. I contacted the front desk and they sent a manager up right away to look over the room. I did not get too upset, I figured every place has an \"off day\" and they sent up a cleaning person right away. They also comped us for breakfast for all three mornings that we were there. We enjoyed the rest of the day and were looking forward to getting a good nights sleep. As we have a seven month old at home and one on the way, this was our only time away and sleeping in and relxing was the primary reason for our get away. the bed was comfortable but at 12:45 am the fire alarm went off. I must say there is nothing better than standing in the middle of Duval Street in your pajamas with a bunch of strangers after being awoken from a sound sleep. Needless to say, we were pretty ticked off. We were told that a guest lit a candle in their room and set off the alarm. It took us about 2 hours to fall back asleep and just when we drifted off, the fire alarm went off again at 4:45. This time it went back off after about 2 minutes, just long enough to get us good and awake. At that point, we were fuming and started calling other hotels to see if they had rooms available to change hotels. Since we were up so early, we figured we wouldl have an early breakfast at the hotel restaurant since we had been comped. The view was beautiful and we started to finally relax a bit when I started eating my eggs. A few bites in I found a black hair in my eggs...now I have long blonde hair so I know it was not mine. I immediately sent my food back and although they offered, I had completely lost my appetite and skipped out on breakfast altogether. We called down to the front desk to see what time the manager came in as I was ready to have a nice \"chat\" at that point. We took a walk and came back to meet with the manager at 9:00. He was very nice and attempted his best to compensate us by comping us for 2 nights stay at the hotel. I had my bags packed and was ready to leave at that point but we were so tired from not sleeping the night before, we really could not make the long drive back. I figured since we were being comped another night we would stay one more night and check out a day early. Thankfully there were no problems with the fire alarm that night and we did get a good nights rest. The next morning we got up and ate breakfast (definitely not at the hotel) and decided to leave a day early. As we were checking out, they gave us a bill which I reviewed. There werechardes for almost $1000 and other than the valet charge and one dinner in the restaurant, we should not have been billed for anything else. The woman at the desk seemed confused when I told her we met with the hotel manager and that we were being comped for both nights of our stay. There were charges for cocktails and mini bar snaks and what not which I knew were not ours. As I looked closer I realized that this was not even o ur bill, it had someone elses name on it! I just rolled my eyes and we asked the valet to pull our car around while we waited in the lobby. Now this is not a huge hotel by any means, so I think a 35 minute wait for your car seemed a bit long. I finally asked them how long it would take to get the car and they said that it had been outside waiting for 15 minutes. I then told them that our car was not outside and they finally realized that they had mixed up our car with someone elses and that they would go to get ours....15 minutes later we finally got our car and although I felt a bit guilty, I did not even tip the valet as I was so aggrevated. I must say that I would strongly discourage staying at this hotel. Although the manager was very nice and tried his best to make up for all of the poor service and problems during our stay, for this kind of money you can stay just about anyplace on Key West. There is another nice hotel called the Pier House across the street that looked lovely. I think we would have changed to that hotel had they not been booked up.

A couple of thoughts and bonuses for the hotel. 1. Don't rent a car in KW. Everything is within walking distance or you can get a pedicab or hop off one of the sightseeing trolleys. 2. You are right at Duval, Whitehead and Front Streets and that's where the action is, but the hotel was quiet. 3. Mallory Square is next to the hotel and huge crowds gather there for the sunset and various performers. Our favorite was a so-so banjo player with his star golden retreiver named Cleo that would come around and take dollar bills from several people at once and then take them over and put them in a bucket. 4.

My wife was so excited about the shrimp fennel risotto, but once it arrived immediately she was not happy. It was lumpy, clumpy, not creamy like good risotto. It almost looked microwaved. It was so hot it over cooked the shrimp. I can't believe they let it leave the kitchen looking like that. I told her to say something twice but she didn't want to a big deal out of it so I'm telling you now so somebody can correct this. We didn't eat again at the hotel just because we didn't want to to take the chance of being disappointed again. She hardly took three bites of it!

Family vacation one Child or 11 and one of 8. Everyone loved the hotel and setting.

Key West at night is fantastic, from haunted walking tours, great food and a very safe and fun atmosphere. i think that's what the kids will remember most; the kick back, relaxed atmosphere. Even during a lightning induced black out, whee the whole town went dark, the laughs continued, the food still came on time and everyone was so friendly. During the day, the hotel was very low key, with a quite pool and luxiourious sun loungers, ranging to mini-cabanas. Throught the day a waitress circled the pool taking orders and providing frozen face towels. A perfectly relaxing experience apart from an 8 and 11 year running riot. The room was huge, with a very large bathroom and sunken bath, which appear to be about 5 feet deep, more like a little hot tub. Nice! Even the walk to reception, from our room or the pool, was quite quaint, with a flora covered canopy across the carpark and little seating areas as one approched reception, decorated with illuminated parrots. I really loved this place at the very tip of the US. Any further south and we would have been smoking cigars with Castro in Cuba. If your like me, and will probably only ever get to Key West once or twice, then don't blow it by staying in a motel, stay here instead.

I apologize now for not remembering anyone's names. The staff was incredible!!!! Check-in- Normal and quick, our porter/valet took us to our room. OMG!!! We were upgraded to a 2 bedroom suite, room 405. It was perfect for us, 3 adults, me, my mom and my aunt. More than enough room for even more people. The first bedroom was a Queen, connecting to the hallway bathroom, which was small but still ample space. The Living/Dining room was HUGE. A a beautiful balcony with a view of the water and Duvall St. The King Bed room had an amazing whirlpool bath in it and a separate bathroom with shower stall. ~~The room was more than we ever expected and more incredible than we ever dreamed. We are definitely spoiled for our next trip. Pool/Liquid Lounge - We went to the pool almost every day. It has a view of the water and one night we even watched the sunset from in the pool. There are tons of comfortable lounge chairs, even some in cabanas if you want to stay out of the sun. On our first visit we snagged a cabana, although we weren't sure if there was an extra charge or not. We went to the bar and got some of the best Mojitos we have ever had. A few moments later a gentleman in hotel uniform comes over, we thought we were getting kicked out the cabana, but no!! he was the pool concierge and he wanted to see how we were enjoying ourselves. We saw him numerous times over the week and he was always helpful, even offered to wait on us from the bar. The bartenders were also great, made great drinks (try the Mango Mojito) and would try to make rounds to the chairs and swimmers to replenish drinks when they weren't too busy. Most days there was a pool boy replacing towels and fixing chairs as well. There are bathrooms near the pool, down a short flight of steps. NOTE: Sign at pool says open dawn to dusk, but book in room says 9am-9pm. One night we called to make sure the pool was open and the front desk said as long as they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get any noise complaints then it was fine. Needless to say we went to the pool most nights, very late. Hot Tin Roof Restaurant \u00e2\u20ac\u201c We ate both dinner and breakfast here, both meals were outstanding. For our dinner, we wanted to sit outside, but it was very windy, the host offered to move us inside, and when we refused to get us pool towels to wear as shawls. The food was very good, but expensive. The mojitos here were also very good. Our breakfast was also good, the tea they serve and the pots they use were really interesting, and now my mom wants one for Christmas. Sunset Pier \u00e2\u20ac\u201c A great place for an app and drink to watch the sunset, away from all the performers by the Westin. The food they serve here is also the food they serve by the pool at lunchtime. I had a mojito club sandwich that was very good. The Spa- One afternoon on a whim I decided to stop by the spa to see if they would fit me in, and I got so lucky. I had a 50 Swedish massage and it was great, there is no sales pitch to buy products or anything. Just a relaxing massage, in a gorgeous room, there was a soaking tub on the balcony and a beautiful view. Concierge \u00e2\u20ac\u201c We used the concierge to book our dolphin/snorkel trip and our Wind and Wine trip on the Danger. She was incredibly helpful and we had a wonderful trip thanks to her. Front Desk \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Every time we went near the desk, the staff was so friendly and helpful. I cannot wait to go back!

Pros - Since we had just two days in Key West, we decided to stay here after so much research. What better address than 0, Duval St. Hotels/Price line/Expedia and all the sites laud this place.

The bathroom was aesthetically decorated and the whirpool/jacuzzi tub was a nice bonus to have... The evening live music was enjoyable and Mallory square being a step away was awesome and again cant beat the location! Cons - All said and done, this is NOT a resort. This is your average Holiday Inn type of hotel, can you accept that as a resort and pay $300-400 per night? Partial Ocean view room that we had booked was facing a parking lot. When I stand in the patio, tilt my head to see across some 5 coconut trees, I see water in some distance. From the room, all I can see is the tree. Be prepared to get wake up call by roosters at 5 30 AM and you can hear them loud and clear. Or service personnel rolling drums or parking noise(we stayed in 3rd floor) or your neighbor shutting the door. The facility is really old, it looks like some apartment complex built decades ago. The valet parking (imagine apartment parking, but not underground) is totally insecure and anyone can walk in to this parking area through the back door (open 24 hrs to all!) and to your rooms too! Internet did not work for us - on an iphone, HTC, ipad and a laptop. The receptionist requested that we bring our system to her. When that happened, the response was \"Due to bad weather, may be the router is not working\". Du'h, thats the most lame reason... like ever. It was difficult to not laugh for that reason, aye. The room had two TVs, really old LG ones. On demand movies / music menu did not work in our room and again the receptionist suggested that someone come and take a look. At 11 in the night, we did not have the patience to go through that. So no TV either. Then my husband was hungry late in the next night and I suggested the snacks that they had beautifully arranged on this side table. As he checked, most of the items had expired. We shot couple of pictures and then got tired clicking other expired stuff there. I've attached two photos here. If above all still qualifies this hotel as a resort, try this. The toilet paper is the really cheap single ply paper that you can only find in public rest rooms on a highway. I lost it there and decided to write here. For all the cons said above, we were waived the 40 $ parking fee off. When I travel from west coast all the way to key west, pay thousands of $, I'd spend that 40 and take a nice vacation in a semi decent place than this one.

On the first occasion the Resort was being cleaned/repainted and we were given a room overlooking Mallory square, unfortunately the large diesel power plant that was providing the cleaning power was directly underneath our balcony which meant that we would have been unable to use the balcony during the day due to diesel fumes. I went back to the front desk and explained the situation only to be told there were no other similar rooms available, not what I wanted to hear so I requested an upgrade, even if it meant paying for it. The front desk could not have been more helpful really, they gave us an ocean front room on the third floor overlooking the tiki bar and sunset pier, there was an additional charge that we came to an agreement over, (as it happened, this was waived on checking out), I think it helped that we kept the issue civil and appreciated the job the staff were doing, they were apparently unaware of the diesel problem. As it turned out, we could not have asked for a better room or outlook, it was certainly one of the holiday highlights. The second visit had a strange similarity to the first, beneath our balcony, again overlooking Mallory square, was a workman with a pipe threading machine, he was installing a small bore pipe system around the Resort/car park, climbing up ladders to be almost level with our balcony whilst he worked, again not acceptable. The front desk offered an alternative room which we didn't really like so we again came to an agreement to upgrade to a better room, this one overlooked the pool and the ocean. All the rooms we looked at and stayed in were furnished in a similar fashion, typical Key West/Caribbean style, all were of an excellent standard and the cleaning could not be faulted. The Resort itself is in an ideal location at the bottom end of Duval street and all the bars/restaurants and entertainment that is available at this end of the island, is within easy reach. There is a motor scooter rental just outside the Resort, boat trips and jet ski hire are also right outside, the tram tour stop is over the road, Mallory square, the ship wreck museum and any number of shops are also right on your doorstep. The tiki bar on sunset pier offers reasonably priced food and drinks, it is a great place to chill out watching the sunset along with the regular live entertainment. We ate at the Resorts Hot Tin Roof restaurant on both visits and had very good meals but the wine is quite expensive for what it is. The pool area is quite compact but is exceptionally clean and well run, the staff were polite and attentive to your needs. The Resort shop offers the usual fare, we thought the prices were quite high, however, not sure that the quality doesn't warrant this, especially the clothing. There is a CVS shop practically next door to the Resort that provides practically all your extra holiday needs, really convenient if you find you have forgotten or run out of something. I thought the nightly car parking fee was a bit on the high side considering the Resort room rates, I appreciate that space is of a premium but the Pier House Resort over the road from the Ocean Key does not charge its clients a parking fee. To address other reviewers comments regarding the \"homeless\" people that live on the Key West streets, people should be aware that a number of these people do sleep and \"live\" around the Resort location, ie. Mallory square. It seems that the Resort management allows them to use the pool area toilet facilities to wash and get drinking water, I assume this is the Resorts choice of action as no staff members prevented them access or moved them on. During our time at Ocean Key, none of these people posed the slightest threat and all were relatively polite if engaged in conversation. At the end of the day this is Key West and I think the general attitude and easy going nature of the Key West locals is commendable. We did notice a couple of minor incidents with street people along Duval street but the Police are quick to respond. Of all the trips and excursions available, and if you have the nerve, I think that the bi-plane flight options are an absolute must, it is literally breath taking, also take some time to visit the cemetery, some really interesting Key West history can be found here. Most of the bars along Duval, (and obviously the other Key West locations). have live entertainment of all styles and to suit all tastes, mostly geared towards drinking and having a great time. there are also any number of excellent restaurants to suit all tastes and budgets, (if you are able, visit Louie's Backyard restaurant, it's certainly one of the best). To sum it up, Key West is a must do/see location for anyone, you have to see it and experience it for yourself and, if your budget allows, the Ocean Key Resort is probably the best place to stay when you do visit. Unfortunately the Ocean Key Resort rates have become a little expensive for myself now I have retired, so when I return to Key West next May, I will be staying at the Pier House Resort, I will review this Resort on my return.", "Date": "October 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "ohio", "Title": "\u201cmanagement needs customer service\u201d", "Author": "ohiorona", "ReviewID": "UR119584505", "Content": "I try to dot my eyes and cross my tees before leaving for a trip.

How about, sorry for the inconvenience go and have a drink on us or I'll send up a bottle of wine, whatever. And the best part is to show how out of touch he was, we had been upgraded before he even got involved and all he had to do was know his property by the room number to know someone in reservations had done this for us already. All he had to do was say, hey we upgraded you, I never knew that until we got to the room. The hotel itself was fine, we had gotten a 2 bedroom suite, but the kitchen in the unit was not remodeled and they kept it locked. These were timeshares converted.

The staff was very friendly, in fact maybe a little too eager to ask you EVERY single time you walked by the front desk if you needed anything and to try to make small talk (sometimes you just want to walk through and not be bothered). The bedding was terrific - high thread counts on the sheets. It had a quaint small pool from which you could watch the sunset. That being said, it just was not worth $500 a night. We were there for a wedding and got a discount and it was still about $300 per night. You can get a larger room with more amenities for one third the price in Vegas. Yes, there is a somewhat decent view of the ocean but you can get better almost anywhere else in Florida ON THE BEACH (no beach anywhere near the Ocean Key) for one third the cost. One bad thing was that they did not have fans for my brother in law's wedding. It is hot during the Summer in Key West. We had to rent 3 fans for over $100 per fan. You would think that a resort that hosts a lot of Weddings and has such a high price would have some large fans to keep people cool. If you are into the Duval Street party scene and have some money to blow, then Ocean Key is probably right for you. It IS very nice. It IS close to the historic part of Key West and the most popular party spots.

We absolutely LOVED Ocean Key. I would say one of it's strongest points, is it's location. It is right at the end of Duval, right next to Mallory Square, where everyone gathers at night to watch the famous Key West sunsets. You're a stone's throw to many of Key West's main attractions and if you're too far, the front desk is more than ready to help you with a taxi, bike or car rentals. The room we had was lovely, with a view of Mallory Square, the ocean and the pool. The rooms are cute and decorated very \"Key West\" in my opinion. The bed was quite comfortable and the room stayed relatively dark with the curtains closed. The restaurants at Ocean are excellent, especially Hot Tin Roof. We found it recommended in many Key West guides and it didn't disappoint. Incredible views, creative and delicious dishes, romantic ambiance and good service. The pool here is quite small, and I imagine that it is packed during the winter months. Other than that, the seating is comfortable, the Liquid Lounge is great and they even walked around offering pool guest frozen towels occasionally! The one downside I do have to mention is the noise. It certainly isn't overly noisy, but the since the halls are tiled, when anyone rolls their luggage or housekeeping rolls their cart through the halls, you hear it. You can also hear talking from the halls and music from the square until about 11pm.

We booked a last-minute deal for a \"junior suite.\" To call this room a suite is a stretch, but the rate of $199 per night was good. If we had paid full price, we would not have checked in. The location of the resort is great--right on Duval Street near shops and restaurants. The entire staff is friendly, knowledgeable, courteous, eager-to-please and polite. However, the physical plant itself is old, not adequately air-conditioned (except in the guest rooms). The elevators are not air-conditioned at all (this, in Florida's summer). In addition, you must walk through the parking lot (no a/c) to get to/from your room just before walking an unair-conditioned catwalk to your room. The room we were in had no mirror at all except for the bathroom. The furnishings were old and worn. There were roosters below our balcony who woke us each morning at 4:30 AM (nobody mentioned this to us prior to check-in). I would have asked for a room away from the poultry. Our view (which I specified was very important to us while booking the room) was obstructed by a wall and billed as overlooking Mallory Square (which it did partially) but mostly overlooked a parking lot. I had a facial at Spa Terre--excellent! Best facial I've ever had--80 minutes including a back massage. We ate dinner at the expensive hotel restaurant, Hot Tin Roof. The food quality was excellent. However, this area too, had inadequate air conditioning. We spent well over $300 for dinner for the two couples and will not return because we don't have to be uncomfortable at those prices.

The rooms are tropical, colorful and sophisticated. We love the boutique suite with its large jetted tub, separate living area and large comfy bed. Oh, and the balcony! Just take the elevator to the second floor to the pool or spa or restaurant. So easy, and that's what Key West is all about. The restaurant, Hot Tin Roof, is award-winning and serves three meals a day and you can dine inside or out, overlooking the water. It's so lovely. Room service is always a great option, too.

The living area was huge with a separate kitchen area, large balcony overlooking Duval Street and in the bathroom was a large Jacuzzi style tub! Awesome!

We stayed in Room 416 which we both agreed had to have been one of the best Ocean Front Rooms at the resort.

The hallways in the resort are outdoor balcony hallways, and the upper floor hallways benefit from the top of the foliage grown on the ground level. The heated pool and large hot tub were great, which we enjoyed for a midnight dip. Staff at the hotel were amazingly polite and helpful, starting with the valet parking your car at arrival, front desk staff, to the bellboy taking your bags and showing you to your room, or room service setting up your breakfast on the balcony. Some of the drawback of this resort are that there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no beach access, onsite parking is expensive, and elevators are not air conditioned.

Best rooms are 416 and 516, also order room service for breakfast on the balcony, stock your room with items from the pharmacy right next door.

Also, we would adjust the room temperature to be cooler when we were sleeping and after a certain point the thermostat would reset itself to a warmer setting.

Didnt like that people were allowed to start saving chairs early am when they were not even there until much later. Cruise ships came and went, one day had one right by Ocean Keys pool. A couple days there were none. We also had room 420 with the notorious tree that blocks the sunset view. It was not really a problem as we had many other opportunities to see the great sunsets ( Mallory square, cruise, Lattitudes) Enjoyed breakfast at Hot Tin Roof-very nice staff there. Front desk staff helpful is recommending places and helping with renting electric car. We really enjoyed a sunset sail on the Adriondeck III--only 12 of us and good winds-would really recommend this.

Ocean Key displayed prominently on one of the main pages of the site and I just had to click to see more. My husband loves Key West. We visited about 4 years ago for about a day and it didn't leave a good taste in my mouth. When I saw how nice Ocean Key was, I knew that for his birthday I would give him a surprise weekend trip there and we would stay at Ocean Key. We live in Orlando and took the one-hour flight down to save us some time and arrived at the resort which is literally situated right at the end of Duval Street. It was a perfect location for being close to the water as well as the excitement of the nightlife. The resort is so charming the way it is laid out with tropical and quirky, yet not tacky accents. We had a partial view of the water and if staying there again, would get a water view room because as the sun sets, it is a very beautiful sight! We had a couples massage while we were there and I must say, that my therapist listened to what I wanted and gave me a massage that left me feeling like jelly. My only complaint about that experience is the noise. We had our massage late in the afternoon.... probably around the time of normal check in I would assume, because someone was either checking in or something was being cleaned in the room above the massage room we were in because I constantly heard chairs being scraped across the tile floor. It was very distracting to say the least. On top of that it was right around the time I assume some kind of pirate reenactment was happening because cannons were constantly being fired. This was also very distracting. While I know the hotel can't dictate the noise of such events, it probably would have been nice to be told that, that event was taking place and that it might interrupt the experience and we probably would have chosen a different time to enjoy our massages. It was pretty chilly in December, as a cold front came in, but the hot tub was hot and the pool wasn't that bad. The bar at the pool was nice and made some very good pina coladas! The room was very nicely decorated, but the large Jacuzzi tub was a bit dated and took a loooooooooong time to fill up, so it wasn't even worth waiting for. The bed was probably my least favorite part of the trip as it wasn't very comfortable in my opinion, although my husband found no qualms with it. There was even a kitchen in the room, which was nice because we were able to go by beers and drinks to keep on hand when we didn't want to leave the room. There are several \"add-ons\" that you can get to the room package and one that I had originally signed up for, yet thought I had cancelled, was \"make your own mojitos\". The tray was left in our room, because we were not there and I was not expecting it. Neither of us knew how to make mojitos, I would have thought the person brining the ingredients to you would maybe possibly show you how, but since we weren't there I wouldn't know. It cost $40 and wasn't worth the money for me as none of the ones we tried to make really tasted anything like a mojito, so that was a bit disappointing.

We stayed there 3/12-3/16 and basically everything was an ordeal. I booked a junior partial ocean view suite through the hotel's website for a romantic vacation with my boyfriend for his birthday. The room averaged about $480/night but it also happened to be Spring Break week down there so I understand everything was ridiculously expensive. I wanted a room that looked like THE picture on the website- the bathtub in the room overlooking the ocean. I started to worry that the room I booked was not the one in the pic so I called the hotel and was informed that the one bedroom suites had the bathtub in the bedroom and, even though they were booked solid, for an extra $50/night they would rearrange everyone to accommodate me. I was so excited! Got down there and low-and-behold, there was no bathtub in the room. I explained my issue at the front desk and was informed that they could not move me until 2 days into my stay, at which point they put me in what I believe was the junior suite with the partial ocean view- the same room I originally booked. The man at the front desk was very apologetic and even sent up champagne and chocolate covered strawberries, which I appreciated, but when we checked out, they charged me all days for the one bedroom suite. I explained the situation to the front desk woman and she agreed to adjust the price for only the days that we weren't in the one bedroom suite but refused for the nights that we stayed in the room... The same room I had specifically stated I did not want. By this point I was so tired of arguing and didn't want my boyfriend to think I was a cheep spoiled brat so I just let it go but I won't stay there again. My advice is if you happen to get the hotel at a bargain in the off season when, if they trick you into paying more for a room you don't want, you have plenty of options for room changes, go for it. It is in a great location. However, if it is one of those situations where you want everything to be perfect, this is not the place to gamble with $500/night. In addition, they lost my reservations to Tin Roof and, when I had explained that I had requested a table weeks before with an ocean view for a very special birthday celebration, they put us on the patio basically overlooking the bushes. Only one of us could see the ocean and enjoy the sunset. Just one thing after another. For the price, I really expected to be wowed and it was nothing but disappointment every time they were supposed to come through.", "Date": "March 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location and upgraded room\u201d", "Author": "JenniferLynn", "ReviewID": "UR101173790", "Content": "We just returned from our two night stay at the Ocean Key, and the location cannot be beat. It's right on the edge of Mallory Square and on Duval Street. We were easily able to walk everywhere. We were supposed to have an island view junior suite but somehow ended up with a two bedroom, two bath suite for just my husband and I. I don't know how, and we certainly didn't complain! Our balcony alone was the size of a normal hotel room! While we had plenty of space, I will admit that there are some things in the room that could be upgraded a little. The master bathroom for one is extremely small and consists of a rather large shower and a toilet, but it's extremely close fitting. The staff was okay - nothing about them was overly friendly, nor were they unpleasant. The pool was rather small and I wish there were more chairs. There was a convention going on when we were there last week and it was difficult to get two chairs. The drinks from the pool bar were also very weak - especially given that they were ~$10. The only downfall of our stay there was that on the last night of our stay they had a concert on the Pier - a band named Badfish played from 9 to 11:30. It was extremely loud and they rehearsed all afternoon, and when you have a clear view of the stage, it's extremely loud in the room - even with all the windows closed. I was just a little surprised that Ocean Key (what I consider an upscale hotel) would book a band that was more so a 'Spring Break' band that catered to a younger crowd. I had booked this hotel originally b/c I did not think that we would have any 'Spring Breakers' staying there. Fortunately for us, the band stopped playing by 11:30.

I've never written a Trip Advisor review before but as the four of us religiously scroll through the reviews before deciding upon which hotel to book for our holidays I thought I should help others make their decision. Although we did contemplate keeping it our little secret!! Our trip started in Miami where we spent a couple of boozy evenings. We then drove down to the The Keys for the bulk of the holiday. We initially decided to stay at The Casa Marina Hotel which is part of The Waldorf Astoria group. We were a little worried about some reports we had read that discussed a cruise ship being docked near the pool at The Ocean Key (totally not the case!!!!!) so we didn't initially choose it. As soon as we arrived at Casa Marina things weren't as we expected. It was a very bland hotel with no real character. The rooms were very average and the pool area was poorly laid out with cheap plastic sun loungers. The plus point was the lovely beach and I can see how if you had children this would be really good for them. We also had a nice lunch by the pool. We had booked everything independently so drove up to see The Ocean Key on our mopeds and the following day checked straight in. The Ocean Key was fantastic...... LOCATION The location of the hotel was superb, right at the end of Duval Street where all the bars and restaurants are located. This meant we could take a simple stroll in the evening or whizz to wherever we were going on our mopeds. If you can hire mopeds whilst you're there definitely go for it. They came in really handy and were great fun. ROOM We went for a deluxe oceanfront room and it was spectacular! Really roomy, loads of Florida Keys character, lovely terrace and a huge bath. POOL Fabulous! The pool itself isn't huge but we much preferred it to The Casa Marina. The whole pool area was infinitely more luxurious. Fantastic sea view, white wooden loungers and a great pool bar. SERVICE The service was first class and the staff were very attentive. The service around the pool was particularly outstanding. The pool girl (whose name I annoyingly now can't remember) couldn't do enough for you and she constantly came round to serve us complimentary water and provide us with cold towels. On checkout I actually got wrongly charged by the hotel however they dealt with it in the right way. They got the hotel manager involved, returned the money and discounted my stay and offered me reduced rates for my next trip - cannot wait!!! RECOMMENDATIONS Whilst we were at Ocean Key we went to some great restaurants along Duval Street. Two noteable experiences were breakfast at Pepe's Cafe and dinner at 915. Get yourself to Mallory Square to see the gorgeous sunsets. The boys would recommend taking some jet skis out - they had a great time! Finally I'd recommend if you can do it hire a boat for the day. We did this and it was a fab day out - take the sun cream though!!!

We had two rooms next to each other on the 4th floor that were clean and spacious and overlooked Mallory Square.

The only thing that helped me justify the rate was during the month of August, the special was a $300 credit toward all incidentals. Which we used gladly.

They happily put us in 417 (king bed & sofa sleeper). The tree hasn't grown that high, yet, so Mallory Square, sunset, and views of cruise ships coming and going was superb. Room had a private balcony where several hours were spent vegitating with adult beverages and watching the sunsets. The roosters are part of the Key West culture, and you'll hear them in the morning even on the higher floors. I slept through it...and most everthing else! If anything, I think the rooms are about $100/nt over-priced, but would definitely consider staying again.

We decided on Ocean Key after reading reviews on Tripadvisor that described this as a nice resort that was close to everything. We could not agree more. We arrived at the resort around 6:30 p.m. and they provided us with an upgrade to a Boutique Suite, Ocean View, 5th floor. I refuse to believe that there could be a better room in the entire resort - our room directly overlooked Sunset Pier and the ocean. Each evening, we watched the sunset from our balcony with a cheese and cracker plate and a bottle of wine, both from room service. The room service was super fast. Everyone at the resort was very friendly and they could not have made us feel more welcome. The reviews about Ocean Key's location were spot on. It is on Zero Duval, across from Pier House. We just walked out of the resort, turned right and made our way down Duval each day. If the buzz of activity annoys you, then you might not want to stay in room 511 but we loved it! and I am sure that there are other rooms that are a bit quieter. We had our own balcony to listen to the live music each evening at Sunset Pier, starting about an hour before sunset until around 10:00 (later on the Sunday before Martin Luther King Day). On our second full day, we discovered the electric car and scooter rental place across the street. I believe it is associated with Pier House. After driving the car for a couple of hours, we decided to keep it for the entire week. Ocean Key has a special place to park electric cars and scooters, both free of charge. The parking spots for the electric cars have charging stations - parking and charging was free. Our room had a king bed, a sofa, desk, a desk chair and a comfy chair. The room had lots of storage space for clothing; no need to live out of our luggage. The bathroom was huge and if you liked, you could open shutters that closed the shower off from the rest of the room and look out on the ocean while showering - a really neat addition. We had breakfast one morning at Hot Tin Roof. My husband had an omelet and I had a breakfast sandwich. Both were great. We would have eaten at the hotel more but were anxious to try other restaurants in town. The rooms were very clean. The hotel allows you to designate the time you want for housekeeping and they keep to the schedule. The housekeepers came again in the evening for turndown service, if desired, and to see if we needed any more towels, shampoo, etc. The entire resort was clean and beautiful - lots of greenery and flowers. People were working all over the resort at all times. Another thing about Key West in general and Ocean Key in particular - we felt safe at all times. I left my wedding ring and diamond earrings in the bathroom each day and they were never touched. That is something that I never would have considered doing at any other place we have stayed. There is a great gift shop included in the resort and we visited it quite frequently. I spent a day at the pool while my husband went fishing. The Liquid Lounge at the pool had great food, great drinks and great service. The pool area was pretty crowded but all of the people were really nice. All in all, we had a great time and will stay at Ocean Key the next time we go to Key West.", "Date": "January 24, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cFabulous way to see in 2010\u201d", "Author": "Katrina500", "ReviewID": "UR53116900", "Content": "Stayed here late December and over New Year until 2nd January.

The photos were awesome and the hotel looked exactly the same. The pool was the best location on all of key west.

We found the other guests to be so friendly, I've never made so many friends on a vacation in my life, and everyone we spoke to had been returning guests which tells a lot about a place. People keep returning for longer stays each time as will we! Each day we'd hang by the pool and talk with others about where they ate for lunch or breakfast and where they were going that night and exchanges tips of what to order and what eateries we HAD to try. I think we will return next year same time too. We arrived early on a Sunday, our room was not ready, they promptly took our bags and we took a cab to Louie's backyard for a awesome brunch of Lobster benedict....and within an hour I rec'd a call from the hotel that our room was ready. They upgraded our room to a gorgeous suite at no extra charge, Huge bedroom and livingroom with table and kitchen...double length balconly. I was traveling for a girl's escape and it was perfect. We had our privacy from one another, we had seperate doors to the balcony huge bathroom. There was a band playing at the sunset bar almost every night. We were walking distance to everything...and not to mention right next door to Mallory Square for evening sunsets and vendors. The pool was the best, delicious lunches and drinks, bartenders were great, wonderful food, music, fresh towels all the time, we'd get there around 10:30 each morning to fresh white towels on the lounges with rolled up bright yellow towels for your neck or back. Mid afternoon they'd come around with complimentary skewers with fresh fruit. Later on as the sun got really hot, the \"cabana boy\"...we liked to think of him as that...lol..he came around with a tray with rolled up wash clothes soaking in ice cubes! It was the best. surprise. Each day we would walk past the spa and then see that gorgeous sun, that heated pool beckoning us and that turquoise ocean just 10 feet ahead of us...and we 'd pass on the spa...if it had rained one day, we would have tried some treatment, but just could not do an indoor thing when the sun was out - it was 85 and gorgeous and at home it was snowing - icey and 18! Each night as we walked out we asked the front desk where to go for dinner or drinks and each time, it was on the money. One guy told us to try Alonso's if we hurried we would make happy hour...1/2 price drinks and appy's til 6:30...omg the best mango margarits...if planning a trip, don't miss them. Huge and only $4. It surely was the best deal. I've read these other reviews and cannot imagine how anyone could find anything wrong with this place. Soooo clean, so spotless, not a piece of paper on the grounds anywhere. Friendly people. If I had to find a fault...one person was right, the elevators were not air conditioned, and with the humidity, it was very warm. Also we tried to reach the front desk and the concierge and anyone that would answer a phone one nite, but had to resort to calling the restaurant and they called a service person for whatever it was we needed. The place was wonderful, beds great, and actually we faced duval street and we loved it. We came home from dinner around 9:30 or 10 and then watched the real show from our balcony, The keys disease hitting the tourists....a few overly tipsy patrons trying to drag one another home...It was a riot. We had the best time. So quiet at night for sleeping, yet lively enough ...we did try the pier house for dinner one night, thinking perhaps it was a nicer hotel..well NO way. The food was good, but the restuarnt was on the side of the hotel and did not have a view of the sunset, the beach (they had a beach and a pool) was about 25 feet wide if that, pathetic looking and the pool was in the middle of the courtyard so did not have the view we had at our hotel. Even our restuarant was better because we could see over the railing for an unobstructed view of the water..Pier House had high railings and looked at the water but from a weird angle. Not to mention the pool out on the pier right next to the water..you cannot beat that view, lying on a chair and seeing the tall ships go by. So relaxing. As for all the complaints of the parking...just leave your stupid cars home, Cabs are right there, and only about $6 to anywhere or walk, it's only 12 blocks wide! The Place was great, and we would like to go back every year the same week and meet all our same friends we made next year. I never ever say I want to go to the same place. We stayed at La Concha once before and that was nice too, the beds were really really soft, like sleeping on a cloud and the roof top bar was cool but this Ocean Key was just the best.

This was my second time staying at the Ocean Key Resort. I had originally stayed almost 15 yrs ago and loved it. Had an island view room with seperate bedroom and was told that this was a mini suite. This time booked another mini suite and was told that they had a special on their partial ocean view so booked the room. Upon arrival we were taken to our room. It is a little outdated but decent. No seperate bedroom so everything is in one room. Nice bathroom and everything is clean. Walked out on our balcony and this is the view of Key West that everyone comes here to see, except we had a huge construction barge in front of our view. We also were woke up every morning by the construction barge driving pilions into the ground (very noisy) which also shook the building. At least they waited until 8:30a.m. to start. Upon arrival expect to have you car taken from you, but you get to pay 20.00 per day for this priveledge; and getting your car back is about a 25 minute ordeal. My first stay at this resort we were given a card and allowed to park on our own. So long story short, for the 300.00 per day that we payed to be there we would probably go elsewhere next time. The general vibe that we got from the staff just put a bad taste in our mouth. Room service was very good but no one else made us feel welcome. Make sure to ask if construction is ongoing when making your reservation; also don't pay attention to what price is quoted online per day be sure to look at the FINAL price there are resort fees plus 20.00 per day to have your car impounded which add up about 80.00 per day.", "Date": "September 14, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "On the Water, Florida", "Title": "\u201cGOOD BUT NOT GREAT!!\u201d", "Author": "AttractiveTraveler", "ReviewID": "UR40487886", "Content": "The location is perfect!!

The bed turn down service is a nice touch but perhaps staff should be aware that if there are only 2 people in the room (certainly 2 on their honeymoon) that perhaps the sofa bed should not automatically be turned down...this was something which consistently happened despite our communication on several occasions that there was no need. Finally it might be adviseable to check your bill on check out carefully though as there were two charges for mini bar on our bill which referred to the night prior to our arrival.

Even though our unit had a kitchen, they kept it locked off. It wasn't a problem for us, as I had no intention of cooking. The cofee-maker is inside the televison cabinet. The unit was nicely decorated and very large. The patio was huge, with 4 chairs and a table. It could be accessed through the living room or bedroom. We also had a dining table and 4 chairs inside. The bath was large, with a huge whirlpool tub and a separate travertine shower with the best rain showerhead. We had a double porcelain pedestal sink that was beautiful. The furniture was rattan with a few colorful accent pieces. I loved the decorating. Wait until you see the pool area! It's decorated in lime green and white and is stunning. We were there at Easter and never had trouble getting loungers. They brought out pineapple kebobs one afternoon for all of us. Right next door is a CVS pharmacy, with reasonable prices on everything.

Nice big fresh bathroom with marble tile, two sinks, a large jacuzzi and large shower. King bed with quality linens, and another door to the balcony. We LOVED the balcony. There was plenty of room for four chairs and a table. We really enjoyed watching the comings and goings on Duvall Street, and we had a grand view of the water too. We ordered room service twice, and Paul, our server, was very friendly and professional. The dinner arrived promply, and was delicious. We ate breakfast one time at Hot Tin Roof. While the view was beautiful, I had had higher expectations of the food. The special banana bread french toast was just warmed, not toasted, and the other warm items were room temp. The pool was fantastic, especially enjoyable for early January. The pool is heated, and very pleasant. Plenty of comfortable chairs and tables, good service for food and drinks, and a great view of the water, especially at sunset. We enjoyed hearing live music in the late afternoon that wafted over from the pier. Suggestions: Take the Conch Train tour that leaves a half block from the hotel. It's two hours long, very instructive and amusing. The girls and I thought we might be a bit bored on a sunset cruise, but we really enjoyed the \"Commotion On The Ocean\" cruise with Fury. They offer unlimited drinks, apps and best of all, live music. The catamaran wasn't too big or crowded, and we had a wonderful time. And they leave from the dock at the hotel. We didn't feel we needed a car for most of our stay in Key West, but one day we have Enterprise pick us up at the hotel, and rented a car to drive to Bahia Honda State Park. I highly recommend you visit this gorgeous beach! Yes, there is seaweed on the beach, but it's soft, and there is plenty of sand to lay your towels and bods. The water was beautifully clear and turquoise, and warm enough to swim even in early Jan. A wonderful day. When you drive in, there is beach with water sports and snacks to the right, but I suggest turning to the left for a more private natural feel. The best meal we had was at Sarabeth's - Sunday brunch.

The following morning, walking to breakfast we passed several staff members none of whom said good morning or even smiled. The breakfast was incredibly expensive, and not very flexible. The waiter was not great and forgot things we had ordered. The pool area is small and people had saved their sun loungers without using them, so it was hard to find one out of the breeze.

We switched our reservation from the Westin a few days before our trip based on reviews we read on TripAdvisor about the construction there and some recent issues with Starwood.

It's right on the water, right beside Mallory Square, and right on Duval Street. You can walk to pretty much everything Key West has to offer. We booked our room through Travelocity, and there was a slight problem with that when we checked in. They didn't have our reservation in their system. Fortunately, I had printed out my Travelocity confirmation since I was charged in full at time of booking (in retrospect, I should have called in advance to confirm my reservation). The front desk person took the printed confirmation and said he would go talk to his manager to sort out the problem. It only took about 10 minutes, and he came back and said everything was taken care of and gave us a complimentary upgrade to an Ocean Front room (we had paid for Old Town view). I've done a lot of traveling, and this was one of the nicer rooms I've stayed in. We had a great view of the water and could even see the sunset from our balcony. There is a large sitting area with a flat screen tv (no HD but we didn't spend much time in the room watching tv anyway) in addition to the bed area. The bathroom was roomy as well with a large tub and double sinks. One neat thing they do that I haven't seen at other hotels is that they let you choose the time window for getting your room serviced. There are 5 or so time slots during the day that you can choose and you just hang the form on your doorknob before going to bed. The pool area is nice, though it can be blocked if there is a big cruise ship docked there. You can google the cruise ship schedule to see when ships will be docked there. It is also not that big and can get crowded during the day. We had a great time in Key West. There are a lot of great restaurants to choose from. We also enjoyed biking around town.

We were shown to our room by the bellboy just minutes prior to the sunset. Our view from the balcony was beautiful but slightly obstructed by some palm trees. We were on the fourth floor above the spa. The room itself is nicely put together. Furnishings are new and the bed was comfortable. Walls are pretty thin as we were able to hear kids laughing next door but they quieted down pretty quickly. Other reviewers have complained about the roosters outside. I did hear them early in the morning (3am ish) but it wasn't loud enough to keep me from falling back asleep. I'm sure that also depends on the location of your room.

We also had some drinks at the Sunset Pier and enjoyed our time there too. We didn't have enough time to lounge at the pool but it sure looks nice and relaxing. I saw the staff cleaning the pool every morning from our balcony. We also took advantage of SpaTerre on their property. My wife and I had a couples massage medley which felt really good. My therapist did a good job of rubbing out some muscle knots. My neck is always very tense and felt great afterward. A few points to mention. Depending on your room location your view may be obstructed by a cruise ship. This was something I was aware of thanks to previous reviewers. Don't let it ruin your mood though because all the cruise ships leave the same day and chances are if there is a cruise ship the next day it won't be docked at the same spot. Besides if you want to watch the sunset Mallory Square is just around the corner and it's the same view. Also, if it's windy in Key West it will be especially windy at the resort.

The front desk supervisor who checked us in (Eddie) was excellant, as was the bellman, Ron. Very effecient, friendly and accomodating. The rooms we had on the 4th floor had good ocean views, overlooking the pool. When we arrived we could not see anything except the cruise ship docked directly in front of the hotel balconies, but it departed on the evening of our arrival. Definitely check to see if there will be a cruise ship docked at the hotel before you pay for an ocean view room. The rooms were nice, but not fabulous. Our room had a great bathroom, which was very large, had upgraded toiletries and the bathroom was very clean. The remainder of the room was certainly acceptable but we found it moderately appointed. It has the \"funky\" Key West syle, which is great, but it looks a little tired. We traveled with another couple. We had one room in between the two rooms each couple had. The people in the room between us had a very loud domestic disturbance on one of the evenings. We did speak to the hotel staff (Catherine) who were very understanding and the staff did address the issue with the other guests and we had no further problems. The remainder of the staff were not overly engaging or outgoing. We had an issue at check out where both couples were charged for valet parking the same car. When I inquired, the staff seemed to dismiss that this could have occurred until we insisted that they compare the bills, at which time they acknowledged and corrected the mistake. It was an enjoyable stay but nothing spectacular. The rooms all open to the outside, rather than a hotel hallway and the elevators to get to our room were in the parking garage. Nothing wrong with this hotel, but if I was going back to Key West I would probably explore other options.", "Date": "November 13, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "England", "Title": "\u201cSuperb\u201d", "Author": "admg1963", "ReviewID": "UR21097579", "Content": "My wife and I visited the Ocean Key a few days after tourists were allowed back after the evacuation for Ike was lifted.

Me and my wife were very impressed indeed..... we have stayed in many hotels and guesthouses all over the world, we are quite well travelled, but this place is truly magical and will remain as one of our favorites and one day we will definitely return..

The room was faultless, all the mod con\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s but with a touch of class and a vintage feel to the room, which is what we love. We had a private balcony that overlooked Mallory Square so we could watch the street entertainers in the square or watch the sunset from our balcony if we wanted. It is lovely by the way that you are treated, all the staff are super friendly and helpful and make you feel really welcome and can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do enough for you, thus ensuring that your stay with them is a pleasurable one... nothing is too much trouble The room came complete with a T.V minibar and refrigerator, along with the nicest furnishings to make you truly feel at home. The pool area is outstanding and is directly next to the ocean, I even saw dolphins swimming in the sea whilst I was laid next to the pool. It was nice to hear people walking past the hotel saying WOW look at that hotel it looks lovely\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6. And I was on the right side of the fence\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 hehe\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 :-) The pool is a good size, the pictures on here are a little deceiving as I thought the pool was going to be a lot smaller than it actually is. The Jacuzzi is excellent and hot!! Another good added feature is that the pool is open 24/7 I saw people sat chilling in the pool and the Jacuzzi after midnight and it was still all lit up and heated. This is the kind of hotel where that is not a problem due to the clientele that it attracts, there is no danger of idiots being in the pool at all hours. One of the staff members sorted us out with discounted tickets to go on the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcFury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 water sport adventures which is based directly outside this hotel. We went on commotion on the ocean and the ultimate adventure and I would recommend both. It cost us $300.00 for both of us, which was an absolute bargain. If there is anything else you want to know about Ocean Key Resort & Spa then please ask and I will try my utmost to assist..

We both had a tough time leaving! Upon arrival we were taken to our room by a very polite and knowledgeable bellboy (note: a Key West bellboy entails shorts and a Hawaiian shirt and \"right on\" affirmations) that described all the hotel amenities and local recommendations. Our room was very spacious & bright but still had a homey feel to it. The bed was extremely comfortable (we opted for the King) and the balcony provided privacy with relaxed seating. We were also intrigued by the shower, which offers a glass pane to see thru (with the option to close off with sliding closet doors). The bathroom is also nice with his & her's sinks but the toilet is not seperate from the main bathroom (no door). In the living space there is a separate couch and chairs in front a large flat-screen TV (there's a 2nd smaller TV in the closet in front of the bed). The closet & drawer space was somewhat limited but ample. But what's best about the Ocean Key is the LOCATION! Our room looked right down onto Mallory Square with a tiny view of the ocean. It's the first address on Duval St. and is seconds away from the hot spots (we recommend Irish Kevin's for a good crowd with humor, RICK's upstairs for a younger dance crowd, Sloppy Joe's for live music and sports). The pool also looks out onto the ocean and is absolutely gorgeous. I had read some reviews that it could get packed but we experienced no such crowds (a few scattered couples relaxing). There was one cruise ship on Tuesday morning which did limit the view and really flood the town with fanny-pack wearing tourists - I would call and see when cruise ships come in to try and avoid those days as much as possible. We also rented a scooter RIGHT across the street from the main entrance. The grounds at Ocean Key are kept in pristine shape and all the greenery looks really lush. We hardly saw any of the groundscrew and the ones that we did encounter were very polite internationals. We had an issue with our billing which was taking care of very quickly and politely and they gladly held our luggage until it was time to fly out. The only MINOR issue we had was one night when some loud (and presumably drunk) people in the room next to us were carrying on and we couldn't sleep (1:30AMish).

We would have been ok with this if the guy at the desk did not get our hopes up, but since he had, we told him we were not happy with the room and wanted something with a better view.

We went from a Junior Suite which was one big room with a living room area and balcony, to a two bedroom two bath suite with a full kitchen, a washer and dryer and a view of the Sunset Pier bar, with turquoise water and boats! In the late afternoon we would just listen to the excellent singer on the Pier while having drinks on our own terrace balcony. We saved money by having a kitchen and having our coffee there and drinks and snacks in the afternoon. The pool was lovely, but small- only one of us used it, and only one time (crowded). We had breakfast at their restaurant \"Hot Tin Roof\" and the food and view were great- service was slow. The housekeeping staff was wonderful and attentive. The one drawback (and there is nothing anyone can do) is the rooster under our window crowing from four AM. If you get a room higher up that would likely help. There were very nice high-end toiletries in the room. They had a spa but we did not use it. We did have drinks and appetizers on Sunset Pier and that was great. There was very nice landscaping, it felt safe there and above all, we were thrilled that we got upgraded for my friend's 50th birthday! They even brought her up a piece of Key Lime Pie for breakfast that morning.

Also very convenient was having a CVS right next door in case you need anything in particular. Which you will, believe me. The room is stocked with beverages and snacks but at a very steep price. We bought our own needs and used the refrigerator which they had no problem with us using. Room came with a Jacuzzi which was very nice and a bathroom with a beautiful stand up shower. Only complaint which is a small one is was the pool area. They have three cabanas which are used by the guests and plenty of lounge chairs which are accompanied with towels. Not that this is the hotels fault but something could be done. Some people like to go down and throw a book or whatever on a chair to save it in the morning and don't actually use it until the afternoon. It's rude and maybe should be monitored by the hotel.

This hotel sets the bar really high for itself with its glossy web site and eclectic vibe it tries to give. Unfortunately they really didn't meet our full expectations as we had hoped they would. We arrived early in Key West and pre-arranged for an early check in and a high floor, but that didn't happen as the rooms were not ready yet and we were never put above the 3rd floor. I say never because we ended up switching rooms twice. Our first room was an awesome open floor Junior suite with a brand new big screen LCD TV and it overlooked Duval Street. Even though we didn't plan on watching much TV we were impressed that a hotel would have them. We loved this room, but it had some issues. The hair dryer did not work, the shower handle fell off and the air conditioning did not work properly. We were forced to move the first day due to no AC. They were nice and gave us 4 free breakfast coupons at the Hot Tin Roof for our trouble and we were very impressed with that. We were then moved to another room on the same floor. This was also considered a Junior Suite but was laid out very differently with a cramped living room area, mirrors all over the walls and a bedroom down a narrow hall. We were happy to also see a new big screen LCD TV in this room as well. It had a hot tub (surrounded by mirrors as well) in the bedroom and a very cramped bathroom with only a toilet and shower. The sink was in another narrow hallway on the other side of the hot tub from the hallway that led from the living room area. The hair dryer was broken in this room too. We stayed there one night and did not enjoy it. I called to see if they had the same type of open floor suite available as we wanted to move. Also a higher floor would be nice. They did have one on the other side of the hotel overlooking Mallory Square and we were quickly moved to that side of the hotel. I noticed I was charged for using the minibar in the second room and I had not. I called and they researched and took the charge off. Very wise to check your tab on the TV while staying there and make sure it is accurate. The third room was again a very nice suite like the first one we had but still on the third floor. I kind of had the feeling too that the hotel was not at capacity and they could have easily moved us higher but did not because we booked on Travelocity and got a fairly reasonable rate. Palm trees blocked most of the view in the third room. It was also missing the large LCD TV which was a bit of letdown but we were fine without it. Also the door to the balcony did not lock which could have been a security issue but we did not complain as we were on the third floor. We remained in this room for the rest of our stay. Housekeeping did a good job and the entire staff at the hotel was very friendly. Only two ice machines exist on the property and they are very hard to find as they were hidden behind lattice work. The breakfast at the Hot Tin Roof was excellent. When we left we were very impressed with the night manager who sensed we had some issues and comped our parking charge. The staff definitely made up for the room issues. The location of this hotel is the best in Key West with many activities going on.

We were so happy when we arrived at check in. The suite was large, clean and lovely. We had a lovely ocean view and large balcony. The next morning i woke up to what i thought was a looming cloud and thunder. No, it was a HUGE cruise ship that we were told later carried 5,000 people parked literally 20 feet away obstructing any view of the ocean. EVERY DAY the cruise ships pulled up at 5am and honked their horns loudly and left at 4pm. Since the pool is beach front, that is what you also see all day. The pool is also very small for a hotel this nice. There were 40 chairs (i counted). Albeit, very nice and comfy chairs with great poolside service and an above average pool side food and bar grill. But still, with 40 chairs, things fill up fast. The room itself is nice with comfy linens, a large bathroom and great room service; i love the room. Unfortuntely there is more to a vacation than a room. Room service was fantastic and housecleaning will come at the time that you ask which is a nice touch. This hotel is located within walking distance to all of the stores and restaurants, although i found the nicest and most upscale store to be in our own hotel. The 2nd day, frustrated with the cruise ship thing, i went downstairs to shop in our hotel store. The nice woman warned me of the constant credit card thefts that locals businesses do. Here is the scam. You buy a teeshirt worth 20.00. They somehow are able to add extra numbers to your bill. So a 20.00 bill can turn into a 200.00 bill. I thanked the woman and used cash the rest of the trip thinking that nothing like that would happen b/c i was shopping at reputable stores on the main street. Well, guys, she was right. I was taken for 600.00 and now have had to cancel my debit card, etc. What a nightmare. Key West is beautiul with Neat bars. Great food. Weather to die for. But beware of all of the local scams that seem to be prevalent. After complaining to the hotel manager Syd about the cruise ship thing, he concurred and said that he understood and would try to get us some sort of compensation. Since we booked through a travel agency, we could not get reimburse that second. So buyer beware. I am not saying do not stay herel it is a lovely hotel.

The bathroom was clean but to get into the shower/bath you had to climb over a ledge/step that was at least 18 inches high and 18 in. deep so it is not for larger people or anyone with mobility difficulties. The shower was fairly feeble and the TV was old. We were not over-impressed. On our last night we upgraded to room 523 on the Western side. This was a considerably larger and nicer room with a view directly over Mallory Square, the quay and the sea. We much preferred this except for two things: much of the paint and d\u00c3\u00a9cor in the room was peeling and discoloured and it needed a makeover; and secondly, there was a trail of tiny Florida ants running down the wall, across the desk, across the bed, over the washbasins and beyond. I killed a large number and when we were going out for the evening we asked reception if they could send someone up to the room to spray it. They were very apologetic and insisted on giving us a free breakfast the next morning. When we returned to the room later nothing had changed and the ants were still on the march, which prevented my wife from sleeping properly that night. We reported this again when we checked out and again they were very apologetic and waived the parking charges for our stay, which was good of them. As I said the staff were at all times friendly and helpful. We only had a continental breakfast but the restaurant it was in was beautiful with fantastic views over the ocean and the staff were fine. A tip if you stay here. In the evening when everyone gathers on the quay to watch the sunset, go to the rather nice but small pool area of the hotel. This faces West and is only a few feet from the sea but is raised about 4 feet over the rest of Mallory Square so you get a good uninterrupted view of the sunset.

Right at the beginning of Duval St. Bars, shops and restaraunts in abundance. We were booked for an island view jr suite. Upon check in we were told we were upgraded to an island view 2 bedroom suite! SWEET! My 10yr daughter had her own room, tv and bathroom...I never had a vacation like that when I was 10...lol. The suite was quite spacious, with a nicely funky decorated living room/dining room that had french doors open onto a patio with very comfy furniture. We had a kitchen, which we didn't really use. Our room had a king bed and double bowl sink/ a section with a vanity and then the \"bathroom\" had a toilet and shower stall. We had a whirlpool tub in our room. One thing you have to understand is that in Key West, cats and rooster run the streets. They are everywhere. So if you have an issue with either, this (Key West) is not the place for you to vacation. We laughed on our first morning when we had some rather windy and rainy weather in the early am. A rooster found refuge in the bushes outside our patio with his woman and woke us at 7am. We thought it was funny. Through the Palm trees you could see Christmas Island and Sunset Pier. I thought it would be noisy because they had live entertainment but it wasn't. We closed the doors anyway. (air conditioning aaahhhhh) We had an end suite, so the only noise we could hear was from the people on the floor above...which I thought was weird. Never noticed that anywhere before. The staff was great except the pool area. We had to sit on chaises farthest from the pool and the girl that was supposed to be taking orders ignored us. Only issue I had with that hotel. They are stringing up plants to block the view of the parking garage on the ground level. We had great service and great food at the Hot Tin Rest. for breakfast. Same for the Sunset pier. We did however get robbed out of one night of the sunset, due to clouds, which is no fault of the hotel...lol ;-). We are considering heading back there next year too. And will probably stay at Ocean Key again. I don't however want to pay $600 a night. But I think I will stick with the island view rooms as they seem to be on the quiter side of the hotel from other reviews I've read. In my opinion, overall, it was a very nice hotel. beds were extremely comfortable, staff (especially bell hops) were great. Great attitudes. But I wouldn't rent a car. We didn't use ours and it cost us $21.50/day just to have them park it in the garage. There is enough things to rent that you don't need a car. And most things are within walking distance.

It overlooked Mallory and the ocean with a great sunset view. So, what's wrong. Firstly, it was very noisy. Not just Mallory Square revellers, but anyone that walked down the hallway who seemed to be speaking in a normal tone, the people above walking or flushing their toilet, it could all be heard loud and clear. Match that the with local flavor: roosters that start up at 4 AM and continue every few minutes until after dawn, and their sound echoing through the center of the hotel buildings and into our room, it was a bit hard to sleep. They could probably make some changes in the hallways or doorways that could help this alot. The second thing that's less exciting is that it just has the feel of a cheaper hotel, from the cars parked below with no effort made at screening them off from pedestrians and the spackled hallways, it's nice, but just isn't at the level of styling and service that you expect when spending the >$750 a night they want for a suite.

Firstly, it is not a \"resort\" in the true sense of the word. It has a small pool and small areas for sun loungers. It has a pier with tables where food and drinks are served, but this is open to the public and can be very busy. It also has a spa. The majority of the ground level is taken up with car parking - at $20 a night - but it is useful to have parking available. Rather oddly, you have to walk out of the hotel and through the car park to reach the lifts to most of the rooms. The lifts are ancient and not in keeping with a hotel in this price range. As they are currently renovating the hotel it is possible the lifts will also be renovated. On the plus side, the rooms are large and ours had an equally large bathroom with whirlpool bath and separate shower. Only a single wash basin though. The staff were friendly and appeared to be well trained, but at times one had the feeling they were working to a well rehearsed script.

Upon check in I was told we had been upgraded to an ocean view, newly renovated room (we had booked a partial ocean view). We were promptly taken up to our room and we were pleasantly surprised by the view, size, and general appearance of the room. Our room overlooked the pier and we were just in time for sunset - which was spectacular. We enjoyed the balcony by having some cocktails and ordering room service for dinner. When I called for room service I was told 20 minutes - which I thought was great, considering room service is almost always 30-45 min. WELL, the 20 minutes turned to 50! When we finally got our food we had no salad dressing! We had to call back and the server had to return with the dressing. He was polite and apologized for the wait and the dressing and explained \"we are just so busy\". The food was good - not great. Back to the room: The room was FABULOUS! We loved the view - the balcony - the decor - the bathroom was huge with a very romantic whirlpool tub which opened into the room. There was a large sitting area and two TV's in the room...the room was quite spacious for the two of us. The mini bar was stocked - complete with wine glasses. The teddy bear on the bed was a comforting touch. Overall, we enjoyed our short two night stay. The location cannot be beat...although we rented an electric car to get around - everything is walking distance - the hotel is on Duval St. - making it the ideal location. We usually only stay at 4 or 5 star hotels/resorts and for the $599+ price tag here we did feel as though we got alot of room for the price (in terms of size and view), however, there were some areas that need improvement to completely justify the price tag (see below for list of dislikes). Overall - Great room, friendly, helpful staff, great ocean front location. LIKES: The ROOM! Clean, bright, airy, lovely ocean front balcony, romantic and comfortable. Location! The best! Watch the sunset - boats - all from your balcony! Walk to everything! NO KIDS! This is not a place for young children. We did not see one. So, no loud screaming in the hallways!!! :) Friendly, helpful staff. Water activites right out your door - boats, jet ski's, etc. Now for the DISLIKES: Room tempature is controlled by the hotel - we could not change the temp from the pre set 71 degrees. The noise from our upstair neighbors - they were really LOUD and woke us up several times during the night with banging (we were on the 3rd floor). The fact that the hotel is built around the parking area - we had to walk through the parking area to leave the hotel - so it was not pretty - there were roosters all over - yes, I mean loud roosters! The stairwells were quite dirty. Food could be better and room service needs improvement.

Dining area & family room. 3 TV's (1 in each BR & 1 in family room). We could have moved in & lived there, comfortably, forever. It was clean & we loved the handpainted, decorative furntiure.

Be sure to go to Mallory Square @ sunset also. There are 2 sections to Mallory Sq. One is all shops & restaurant & bars, the other is located next to the water (where the cruise ships come in). Go to the one next to the water @ approx. 6:00 PM. The street performers there are amazing! You can buy a beer @ the little kiosk & watch half a dozen terrific entertainers, form tightrope walkers to jugglers & everything inbetween. So much fun! One last thing about Key West.....At the opposite end of Duvall St., approx. 1.25 miles (you can walk) is the Butterfly House. OMG! It is SOOO awesome. It is a conservatory housing small birds, exotic plants, flowers& thousands of butterflys! You pay $10.00 to enter & when you walk in, it is stunning! The butterflys are EVERYWHERE! They land on your head, arms, camera, shoulders, etc. There are butterflys of every shape & color. It looks like the Garden of Eden! So worth the walk & entrance fee! Back to Ocean Key, we had breakfast @ Hot Tin Roof & it was amazing. We ate dinner elsewhere as there are hundreds of restaurants within walking distance.

The reservation agent told us that the resort was currently under renovation and to expect that many rooms were being renovated and the pool was also closed for renovation (this a nice heads-up of what to expect, rather than getting there and finding out about it). We checked in but were unhappy with the room. We did not feel that the room met the standards for a four-star Noble House property. This is where management stepped up to the plate and EXCEEDED our expectations by IMMEDIATELY fixing the problem. We were moved to an appropriate room and the previous room was taken out of service. We were thanked for bringing our concern to their attention. We were offered free breakfast (not necessary, but it was a nice gesture). The room we end up in was perfect. Even the standard rooms have a jetted tub. Nice. The bath products are from the spa (on-site) and are very nice with a tropical scent. The \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fancy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd restaurant onlyserves dinner and has a limited menu. The casual restaurant is outside seating only, but has a nice breakfast and burger type fare for lunch. Every seat in the casual restaurant (outside) is on the water with great views. Most items are around $10 for breakfast or lunch. The location (Zero Duval) is literally von top of Mallory Square (where all the people gather to view the sunset). Half the rooms have balconies that actually overlook Mallory square and the water (ask for these as it is a perfect view). The concierge booked our parasailing (~$100 for a tandem parasailing ride, included a photo CD with about 40 shots of us parasailing!) He also booked our day long trip to the Dry Tortugas National Park (~$150 each included breakfast, lunch, national park admission, snorkeling equipment, and the round-tip boat ride of 70 miles each way). We recommend both activities. You may want to contact the concierge before you arrive so they can book these activities for you as they seem to sell out. We tipped the concierge $15 for his assistance. The hotel is decorated in a tropical beach motif with lots of blue and green. It is a very refreshing color scheme. The only drawbacks to this property are: (1) it is under renovation; (2) the pool is closed; (3) the elevators seem to lack air conditioning; (4) it has exterior corridors, so if you do not like the heat (especially in the summer), this could be a problem.

To say we LOVED the resort is an understatement !! We booked the \"Sensory Overload\" package. Our room was beautiful. Loved the double sinks in the bathroom and the whirlpool tub. The balcony was small and intimate and the view from the balcony was AWESOME !!! Our room (#421) overlooked Mallory Square to the left, the Gulf straight ahead and the pool/Sunset Pier to the right. Our room was clean upon arriving and the maid kept it spotless. As someone else on here mentioned, they provide plenty of towels for a second shower in the middle of the day (it's really hot this time of year!). The location was perfect....right within walking distance of everything. There is a Glass bottom boat tour dock right there, the Conch Railroad tour (GREAT for learning about Key West history), bike and electric car rental is right there.......and also a CVS Pharmacy is two blocks away incase you need some last minute essentials. We did everything online....booked the room from the hotel's website and e-mailed the resort to book the Spa appointments as well as to ask questions about the hotel from Bill the Director of Sales and Marketing. Bill was always EXTREMELY friendly and helpful with his e-mail replies and very accommodating (we requested the mini fridge be emptied to be able to store our own little snacks). On check in the staff was (as everyone has already said here)very friendly and helpful. There was construction on our floor (the resort made us fully aware of this before check in)but it was no big deal because we were out during the day and they kept to the construction time frames (I think it was 9am-5pm).Heck I even took a mid-day nap with the construction going on and it wasn't bad... I was able to sleep. The \"Sensory Overload\" package includes $50 per day credit for Spa Treatments and free dinner each night during your stay (including soft drinks, salad, entree and even dessert!) \u00e2\u20ac\u201cgratuity not included. The Spa treatments were INCREDIBLE! I had the Balinese Massage the first day with Amy and she was great ! This is a wonderful massage that actually relaxes you first then gives you incredible energy at the end !! Next massage was the Hot Stone Massage with Andrea'. This was wonderful too; incredibly relaxing......I could have napped afterwards. The Spa itself was really cute and cozy. The receptionist genuinely seemed to care how my massages were afterwards and was so friendly and welcoming upon my arrival. We LOVED the hotel restaurant The Hot Tin Roof and actually used our hotel package credits to eat free here EVERY NIGHT !!! We were able to try everything on the menu this way and we received impeccable service. 3 of the 4 nights we had our favorite waiter Albert. Albert was the most attentive and warm friendly waiter we have ever met !! The food at the restaurant was delicious!! You can't beat having Lobster every night with only paying a $30-$40 tip!!! Seriously, we did not have Lobster every night, but you could have with the package. The hotel might have thought \"With all these incredible restaurants in the area, who in their right mind would have dinner here each night?\" They hadn't met us yet !!! Seriously there are a ton of restaurants to try and I am sure we might have missed out on some great food as many restaurants are not open for lunch, but with the incredible service we received from Albert and the mouth watering delectable food we consumed at The Hot Tin Roof - it was a no brainer to just eat there each night. We felt at home !!! We sat inside twice and outside on the balcony twice. Witnessed incredible sunsets on the balcony. The view was incredible ! By the 4th night the restaurant actually trusted us enough to give our opinion on a new dessert they were trying out. Also the restaurant manager John was no exception to the whole team at Ocean Key Resort & Spa - he made us feel very welcome in the restaurant. We also had breakfast one morning at the restaurant at the hotel on Sunset Pier. Great view, again excellent food....although we missed Albert. :-) I took a ton of photos (attached) specifically for TripAdvisor.com because we found this hotel on this website and I wanted to be able to give back to the website to help others considering this hotel. Roosters - Ok, some people have complained about the roosters waking them up. Not only do they go off in the morning (about 6am on our stay) but also ALL DAY intermittently. They are not bad and did not wake us up. My husband is an early riser so we were already up. His getting up to use the bathroom woke me up, not the roosters !! On the first morning, it was like the magic & excitement of Christmas morning as my husband said to me with a huge smile \"Do you hear the roosters ?\" then we got up to look for them over the balcony. Sure enough as the sun rose the roosters would crow and run closer and closer to the ocean through the brick lined floor of Mallory Square. We'd never seen anything like it !! The roosters are part of the charm of Key West people ! Maybe our room was positioned so it wasn't that bad to hear them and be annoyed by them, but with being back home and hearing traffic outside our Downtown Orlando condo I welcome the sound of roosters again instead !!!! Please note the pictures of the room attached to this review are probably going to be outdated soon as I believe the furniture in the room and the room look itself is undergoing construction, however if you stay at the hotel SOON your room might still look like ours did. It was the \"Oceanview Boutique Suite \". They even have a house cat...on our first night we arrived back at the hotel from sightseeing around 9pm and met \"Buddy\" a black cat sitting in the lobby. A staff member explained he was the house cat and the restaurant was named for Buddy - because he used to walk on the roof when they first built the place, so cat on a \"Hot Tin Roof\"!. As many have mentioned the restaurant next to the hotel and in front of Mallory Square \"El Meson De Pepe\" (the Cuban place) has awesome food !! It also has a little Cuban history museum inside. Elevators- Yes they have no ac in them but with the mirrors and elaborate wood design - they are beautiful !! Plus how long are you riding in an elevator anyway? We stayed during temps in the low 90's and were on the 4th floor and had no problems riding in the warm elevator for a few floors. Cruise ships- We only had a cruise ship block our balcony view of Mallory Square/Gulf for one day. It was there from about 6am - 4pm. It was no big deal. Again, same with the roosters....it's charming. How often do you wake up to look outside and see a huge cruise ship in front of your balcony !!! Parking-It was $18 a day to park on property, but that is expected anywhere in Key West where space is limited. It was neat how the parking is arranged.....they park your vehicle for you with the valet and it's on the ground floor incase you need to get something out of your car during your stay. We brought bottled water so it was neat to be able to see our car safely stored each day and also to be able to restock our water for the mini fridge. You might be wondering if we didn't like anything about the hotel. Our only complaints are #1) the bed was extra firm. This might have been partly our fault because we are used to sleeping on a pillow top mattress. Any with the construction going on perhaps new beds (mattresses) are part of the improvements. #2) the last night I took a bath with lukewarm water because there seemed to be no hot water left. Our showers were just as lukewarm in the morning, but this was probably our fault for not complaining sooner. My husband told the desk clerk about this on check out and he seemed horrified and concerned, explaining with the construction the construction team sometimes works and forgets to plug the water heaters back in. So just make sure to communicate your concerns with staff during your stay and they will take care of any issues with concern and attentiveness. This was our first stay in Key West and easily the best vacation of our lives due to the relaxed feeling of Key West. Ocean Key Resort & Spa obviously played a HUGE part in our feelings on this. We will be back and have been telling everyone about the great service and amenities this resort has to offer.

Ocean Key is part of the Noble House resort group which I'm very familiar with. We felt very confident in booking here based on that and the reviews I saw here on trip advisor. We got a great rate for a partial ocean view jr. suite through the hotel's website. Check in was fast and efficient but it was all down hill from there. The room was clean but only just barely. The tile floor was so dark and dingy looking that I didn't want to take my shoes off. There were stains on the couch fabric that grossed me out. I had to put a sheet down before I sat down. And my allergies immediately kicked in telling me there was dust and mold in the room. Although the bathroom was clean, the staff didn't do a thorough job of dusting. You could see it on shelves and fixtures. In fact all the furniture was like that. And there were scuff/dirt marks all over the walls. In need of serious repainting. At this point, I'm a little disappointed but trying to make the best of it. While unpacking, we can hear roosters crowing in Mallory Square. This went on for about an hour and it was in the afternoon. This concerns me because I'm a light sleeper and don't want to hear them in the morning. I can also hear the people talking in the room next to me and someone in the room above us keeps moving furniture around and I can hear it scraping the tile floor. I call the front desk to see if we can move to another side of the hotel to at least get away from the roosters. The snotty young man I spoke to gave me this whole lecture about the wild roosters being a protected species on the island and they are all over and you're not supposed to catch them. I told him I don't want to catch them, I just don't want to hear them. He basically told me I have no choice, you will hear the roosters everywhere. Very helpful! Well, the roosters woke me up early the next morning. And they don't just crow for a little while and then stop. No, they keep crowing. My husband complained that in addition to the roosters, there was too much light coming into the room. There is a window next to the door with louvers but they don't completely cover the window so a lot of light came into the room in the morning. So far not my idea of a relaxing vacation. That was all we could take. After the mean guy we spoke to yesterday, we did not feel like arguing with the hotel staff to maybe get a different room that would probably have the same problems. I made a couple phone calls and a very nice woman at the Marquesa Hotel matched the rate we had at the Ocean Key. We checked out and paid the $100 early checkout fee. They weren't even concerned as to why we were leaving after one night when we had booked for five nights. We had a beautiful room at the Marquesa.

Our room was excellent \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a two bedroom suite (there were only two of us) with full kitchen, fridge, clothes washer and dryer, dishwasher etc. There was a basket of goodies on the countertop and in the fridge to purchase if you wanted \u00e2\u20ac\u201c biscuits, chocolate, wine and spirits, champagne, soft drinks etc. It was quite expensive, but a nice touch. The toiletries in the bathrooms were lovely and the whirlpool tub was fantastic (though we only used it once as it took an age to fill). The suite had a large balcony overlooking the pier and was a great place to relax. We ordered room service breakfast one day and it was nice to eat out on the balcony though the portions were rather skimpy \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a slice of toast with the omelette wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have gone amiss (they even brought jars of jam, but I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not sure what we were supposed to do with them!). We thought the prices were reasonable, but exchange rates for the UK are so good at the moment. We booked the room online with opodo and it was less than $200 per night which was excellent value \u00e2\u20ac\u201c they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mention that you have to pay the various taxes separately which is a bit cheeky, but that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an issue with the online booking site rather than the hotel.

We now had a room that faced the pool/Mallory Square/sunset's. Oh, the room was also much larger than what was booked and now became a large 2 room suite. We could have asked for no more. The staff was always polite and attending always said good morning and would offer the elavator to us first. An example of a well trained staff. The little things werere important to them and it was evident it their approach to their guest. The grounds were well kept and in good order. The pool was clean and towels always provided. Although I did notice this was a function of who was working the pool. Our young waitress was very attentive. However on her off day we had a waiter who did seem a bit out of sync. From our room we had 10 steps and we were on Mallory square -- you can not get better than that. Or, maybe we could. We also chose to watch the sunset from our patio. While during the day there could be a cruis ship in our way, during the evening (after 3) all was open to seen the great setting sun. The beauty of OKR beyond the resort itself was how close you are to what makes Key West unique. The free-spirit town itself with all the shopping and nightlife. For us it was a 10 sec walk and we are in the middle of it all. While the upgrade in room contributed to much of our enjoyment there were too many other positives to say this was the only reason we had such a good time.

The maintenance man had gotten white paint all over their black vehicle, then decided he would \u00e2\u20ac\u0153scrub\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd it off with whatever metal rag he had in his pocket, completely destroying the paint job down both sides, and the entire front end including the front bumper. As you can imagine, that put a damper in everyone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mood, opinion of the resort, and literally made the entire remainder of the stay at the Ocean Key Resort miserable. The response from the manager was not comforting, and he did not make the situation seem like a concern for him. He merely handed them an incident report and a card for the HR department and said he was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very sorry.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Hot Tin Roof had very good breakfast, however the staff was slow and not always correct in the orders. When we checked out, we were rushed through the process. My husband and I DID pay for our first night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stay, even though it was something out of a bad movie. The desk employee did not take our valet ticket so we had about 4 people get their vehicles first, and finally when our vehicle did arrive we had no one available to help load our belongings. My husband and I had hoped for a fun and romantic getaway to the Ocean Key Resort, what we had was a catastrophe and we will never stay at that hotel again. The Lexus had to be completely repainted and the front windshield replaced due to the extensive damage. The hotel did pay for the damage...after many phone calls and hassel. Regardless, my sister-in-law was left without a vehicle for over a week and a half while the repairs were completed. Bottom line, you would be better off with Chevy Chase on a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Griswald Family Vacation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd than ever staying at the Ocean Key Resort.", "Date": "October 4, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Panama City, FL", "Title": "\u201cfor $189?

In the end we felt let down. The lobby is lovely and the people all friendly, but then the niceties end. The elevators had no AC or any air flowing in and were hotter than being outside. We thought it was a temporary inconvience, but a sign was never put up and it stayed that way for the whole 4 night stay. So we get to our room and we head straight for the balcony. It really is an Awesome view. Then we turned around and were slightly horrified by the whirlpool tub surrounded by mirrors, only 2 feet from the bed, in the middle of the room. Let's start with the tub. Loud, not quite big enough for 2, and hard to get in and out of. It is deep (nice) but there is no step into it, you just drop. Getting out is just as hard since you step onto slick wet marble. The mirrors also were a little cheesy, like a sleazy motel. The lack of a door or anything made it quite obvious that this suite was meant for couples only. The bathroom area is a little odd, too. The double sink was gorgeous (would love one like that in our house), but the actual place where the toilet and shower were was awful. Very small and cramped into a small place with no privacy. The door to the toilet/shower area was a shutter door. You know, the ones with slats in them?? Not cool. The shower also did not accomodate 2 people very well, and that was glass also. Very little privacy in the suite. And then there was the bed. VERY uncomfortable. We checked the mattress and it is this miserable thin thing. We only assumed this \"luxury\" resort would have at least nice beds. The linens were pretty scratchy and standard Days Inn fare with the velour blanket and silly \"comforter\". We've stayed at Doubletrees for $130-$150 a night and had more luxury (awesome beds, pillows, comforters, cookies!) than this place. We were so tired at the end of the night that we never complained about most things to the staff, and put up with all the issues. I am sure that if we had said something, the friendly staff would have tried to fix it as best they could, even though the website practically guarantees perfection. Oh well. Was it worth the half rate of $189? No, since you are only paying for location, (which was fantastic). We would walk a few extra blocks or a different view to get a better room next time. I don't know about the other rooms, but room 506 did not live up to the hype. PS: Honeymooners: Don't expect any upgrades, champagne, etc. Us and another couple had made it quite clear that it was a honeymoon and neither received anything.

We had two minor issues during our stay and they were both resolved almost immediately. Although our stay was spectacular, I do want to point out what I think were some of the cons of the resort. Considering there was an LG flat screen plasma TV in the room, there were some items in our room that surprisingly were dated and in need of updating/repair. For example, the jacuzzi tub in the bedroom needed to be updated. Also, there was a piece of metal rim at the base of the sliding doors to the balcony that was completely bent and appeared dangerous for an adult to step over, never mind a 14 month old. We also noticed that the tile floors in the room was very dirty. We were uncomfortable walking around with bare feet. We did request it to be cleaned, and they happily accommodated the request. However, as the days went on, the floors got dirty quickly and they don't appear to clean the floors at all. I know, I know...these are nitpickey items but this is a high-end, luxury resort. They should have these details down. Regardless, it is a wonderful resort. The property is nice but not as nice as the Pier House across the street (we took a walk over on the advice of some other guests).

(more on this later)The room was very colorful, large and comfortable. From our balcony (3rd floor) we had a view out over the pool, Mallory Square, and the ocean. I think we liked this better than the rooms at the back of the hotel which were direct ocean front, but no views of Mallory Square, or the pool. We emptied the honor bar (put everything on the dresser above) and went to CVS next door to stock the refrigerator with our own drinks. This lead to a mistaken charge of $25 on our bill that was quickly removed at check out. The service at this hotel was exceptional. Each day the lounges at the pool are covered with towels, and you are given another one to use. The staff delivers iced water with lemon or lime, as well as any drinks or food you may want to purchase. They also have a bucket of all types of sunscreen for guests to use. Though the pool is small it is perfectly positioned for sea breezes and watching the boat traffic. One day a crusie ship parked right in front of the pool which was awful. All other days they docked on the other side of Mallory Square down by the Hilton. Breakfast at the Hot Tin Roof was very good with nice variety; a pot of coffee, a USA Today paper, and prompt service. We did not eat any other meals at the hotel, but were told dinner there is amazing. We did eat at Conch Republic (not good), Michaels (wonderful) and A&B Lobster which was very good if not for the rude attitude of the staff. Island Dog Bar right around the corner from the hotel had great burgers, and light fare as well as A/C and entertainment. Overall we had a great trip and would definitely stay at this hotel again. Our only regeret was that we did not check out the spa until our next to last day. The certificates did not have a value on them, and we found that they could be applied toward any service even though they indicated a head, shoulders, and foot massage. I quickly booked the signature facial, and my husband was able to squeeze in a massage one day and pedicure the next day. The spa is busy and I would suggest making appointments as far in advance as possible. Since we waited until the last minute and did not want to waste the certificates, we had to take the spa services that were available but still checked out leaving 5 unused. Sunset Pier was a lot of fun. It is right on the other side of the hotel from Mallory Square, and has entertainment each evening at sunset. The staff was great, efficient, and very friendly. We had a 6 pm flight out and asked about checkibng out later than the posted time of 11 am.

It is difficult to please teenagers & us oldies but we did exactly that by staying at the Ocean Key. We found the best deal by 'phoning the hotel direct, it was an even better rate than quoted on their website.We stayed for 2 nights commencing 30th June in 1 of only 2 (I believe) 2 bed/2bath suites. On advice, by 'phone from the reservations dept, we chose the suite on the 4th floor that has the better view of the 2 suites. This is room 410 & overlooks the pier & ocean. However, the view is 'softened' by the palm trees which I guess will continue to grow. It is a spacious suite which gave our girls a sense of being in an apartment. There was a fully fitted kitchen which included dishwasher & washing machine, a good-sized dining area & also sitting room area. Our bedroom was large with a jacuzzi tub in it & a huge sleigh bed. 2 hand basins, toilet & shower were in the bathroom. Our bedroom also had a door leading out onto the large balcony which also had french doors leading to the sitting area of our suite. The second bedroom had a large double bed & bathroom with half-sunken bath as well as all the usual necessary facilities.This had a good-sized window which overlooked the courtyard. On the balcony were 2 chairs & a table, also 2 recliners & table. The chairs & recliners were covered with thick comfy cushions. the quality was excellent as was true of all the furnishings.We all enjoyed sitting on our balcony letting life go by. The pool was good & never crowded even though it was pre-4th July weekend. I like the touch of the staff always being on hand to give you fresh towels & laying 2 towels on each lounger each time some guests had departed. We ate at The Pier one evening & thoroughly enjoyed watching the sunset & listening to fab live music from an excellent singer.It isn't expensive when you consider the location & unbeatable view. I had a couple of 'Foto Finnish' cocktails at $7.50 each.They wosh lurrvvly! I won't repeat the praise that has been heaped upon Ocean Key but, I do agree with it. Also, take note of the useful comments that tripadviser users have given. The girls I had made use of the Spaaaaaaaaaaaah. Wonderful treatments & worth every penny if that is the sort of treat you like. Do note that service is added on top of the prices quoted & then tax. Do make sure that you take a trip on the 'Conch Train', $25 per head but, a great way to see & learn lots in an hour & a half. We did the 'Original Ghost Tour'(make sure it is the ORIGINAL TOUR , not the Legends) on Friday evening. $15 per head with discount coupon available in the hotel reception. Try to go on a night that 'Brant' is your guide, he is fantastic, the girls loved him. Again great entertainment & value for the money. Go to Ocean Key & enjoy everything that we & other tripadviser commentators have enjoyed. We had a couple of issues which the management sorted promptly, courteously & efficiently. Do take care when booking a room/suite. Ocean view overlooks the pool below which could be noisy & then the ocean with cruise ships coming & going on various days so check. Ocean front overlooks The Pier & harbour & ocean. The view here on the lower floors could be interupted by palm trees. Think about what you want. Also the type of room/suite you want.

Only drawback for me was there was a skylight which apparently all the top floor rooms have which makes it difficult to sleep in with all the sunlight pouring in. The hotel's restaurant, Hot Tin Roof, was decorated very nicely as well as the lounge area where we enjoyed having a drink each night and watching the sunset plus all the boats sail by. We had breakfast one morning which was very good and sat outside on their covered lanai which has a great view. Other restaurant suggestions are the Roof Top Cafe very close to the hotel which has wonderful food (celebrated our anniversary there) and the ambiance is very nice. We had a very nice lunch at the Grand Cafe where we ate inside which is very nicely decorated and was a short walk from the hotel.

We are Florida Natives and come to Key West for some R&R every year or so and have stayed in many different resorts on the Island. I booked on their website for a Junior Suite and we got a Florida Resident discount, so the bill came out to around 210.00 per night with taxes and fees, which is very reasonable especially for the quality and location of this hotel. Let me begin by saying that the Ocean Key far exceeded our expectations and from now on, we will only stay at the Ocean Key! Arrival: We pulled up to the Ocean Key at about 1:30 PM at the end of Duval Street, and we were greeted so warmly by the bellman. He welcomed us very heartily to the Ocean Key, asked us if he could take care of our bags and also our car. When we walked in we were also greeted very warmly by all of the desk attendants and the concierge. We went to the desk and proceeded with check-in. They informed us that our room was not ready yet, but that they would take care of our things and they had our cellphone number and would call us when the room was ready, and to go have fun while we waited. As we left the lobby we just couldn't believe how warm the welcome was, I mean, we have stayed at many places before, but never had we been received before in this way! It may seem like a small thing to some of you, but this really set the tone for our vacation! Room: After about 45 minutes of sightseeing, we received the call from the desk saying that our room was ready. We made a short walk back to the hotel and received our room keys and the bellman got our bags and showed us to the room. He showed us to the elevator, all the while telling us about some of the happenings on the Island during our stay. He then brought us to our room and left. We did notice soon after he left that this room didn't have a jacuzzi tub and I had expected one as it described on the website. I phoned the desk and explained my concern, and they quickly told me that they would see if they could get us a room with the jacuzzi tub and would call me right back. Two minutes later, they rang and said that the bellman was on his way back up to take us to our new room. FYI, if you would like the jacuzzi tub, be sure to ask for one with the Junior Suite, some only have a standing shower. When we got to our new room, we were so impressed. When you walk in you have a living room, complete with sofa bed, chair, coffee table, a credenza with a TV and mini-bar fridge stocked with goodies (they are very expensive though!). You then have a hall-way with a large closet with extra pillows. Next is the beautiful bedroom with a large Island Style bed with tropical bedspread, lots of comfy pillows and even a tropical teddy bear (too cute)! Nearby the bed is the jacuzzi tub (yeah!) and the bedroom has a tall wood-paneled vaulted cieling with a fan to keep you cool. The restroom is a long hallway with double pedestal sinks, two more closets and a toilet closet with a standing shower. There is also a dressing area with a stool and lots of their yummy smelling toiletries from Spa Terre (the coconut lotion was my fave!) There is an armoire decorated Island Style with another TV and 4 roomy drawers for your clothes. On top of all of this you have a french door leading out to the balcony with a table and two comfy chairs where we had a view of the water to our left and Duval street and Key West to our right. We loved coming out here to see all the goings-on and to chill in between our activities. Dining: We had breakfast at Hot Tin Roof which was amazing! I had the Noble Benedict which had wilted baby spinach, canadian bacon, two poached eggs, Florida lobster meat and a key lime hollandaise--very yummy! My husband had the Ocean Key benedict which was a split homemade biscuit with sausage, scrambled eggs, melted cheese and gravy..very yummy as well. The prices were reasonable and the food was excellent! We didn't have lunch or dinner here though, those meals looked a little more pricey. We had drinks at the Sunset Pier, but never dined there, but we did enjoy the view and the close proximity to Mallory Square. Location: This hotel has to be in the best spot if you love to explore Duval Street! You are close to Hog's Breath, Sloppy Joe's, Front Street and the harbor restaurants and shops, watersports activities, and of course Mallory Square and the sunset celebration. We have stayed in other locations, but this was, to us the best location for what we wanted to do while we were here. Customer Service: I can't say enough about how friendly and helpful the staff was during our stay. For instance, my husband was badly in need of a haircut and they recommended Salon 128 to us and they took him right away, gave him a quick and great haircut and it wasn't pricey either. We felt confident to ask them anything we needed and got helpful advice everytime! Tip: There is a CVS pharmacy/convenience store downstairs and next to the Ocean Key. I would recommend stocking up on all of your snacks, sodas, beers, etc. here instead of using the items in the mini-fridge, it will save you lots of $$! I wish we knew about that beforehand. Overall: This vacation we took was honestly the best stay we have ever had on the island, thanks to the Ocean Key, even though the weather wasn't so great due to Tropical Storm Alberto. Our room was awesome, the extras were the best, the prices were reasonable, the food and drink was good, the location unbeatable, and the customer service was top-notch.

For the life of me, I cannot understand some of the bad reviews. Maybe it was becasue we were getting married here and we were spending alot of cash, but I really doubt it. From the moment we set foot here, we were treated above and beyond our expectations. We had stayed one night at the Pier House the night before and had to meet with our vendors throughout the day so we walked into the Ocean Key at around 9am and they immediately congratulated us on our upcoming wedding before we even introduced ourselves. (They saw her wedding dress in a David's Bridal bag.) They said they would hold our 5 bags of stuff and call us when our room was ready. They ended up calling us at 1130 so we had a quick lunch at Lobo's and headed back. When we got there, our luggage was waiting in Room 418 and when we walked in, we realized they upgraded us from a Jr Suite to a big Boutique Suite. It had a great bathroom that my fiance (wife) loved!!! It had a 42 inch flatscreen TV too. Yes, the colors may be a bit tacky, but so what! The bed was a kingsleigh and was very confortable also. Yes, the pool area is not huge, but I always was serviced quickly and was given towels, drinks, and food by Charles the pool guy in a pretty timely manner. The water was a perfect temperature for conditions becasue it cooled you off quick and you could adjust to it quickly. It was not bathwater so it made it more enjoyable. The tiles are scorching hot arounf the pool so make sure you keep your flipflops on too. The spa services were top notch too and while thier workout area is small, I never had anyone else in there when I worked out so it was not a problem. They set up snorkeling and jet skiiing for me with no problem too. Room service was better than average. The only negative I have is that their elevators need some work. I was on the 4th floor so I took the stairs the majority of the time because I cant wait for an elevator more than a minute. However, that complaint is a very small one and really should not effect your stay. I have stayed at sprawling 5 star resorts the last three years with far more amenities than here but I had ten times the experience here than I did at any one of them.

However this time it went wrong from the start. We arrived at the 4:00 p.m. flight from Orlando. Once we were there they only had 1 Junior Suite ready, so I think no problem. Wrong. The suite was a handicap suite on the 2nd. floor. I'm sorry but we are not handicapped and it wasn't what we were exspecting. We took it anyway to be nice. Well after a couple of hours the air conditioning went out. 78 degrees in the room, no way was this going to work. They generously sent someone to work on it, but we requested a move, which was only 1 door down. Ok, now we have a room and its cool. Then the next morning we are awaken at 7:00 a.m. by the sewer truck pumping S**t from the drains at the resort. What a wreck. Finally after about 30 minutes the truck blew up...thank goodness for this, there was smoke everywhere, not to say the noise was unbelieveable. Well, maybe a day at the pool was going to be better. Wrong again, they had 6 electricians which only 1 looked like he was working trying to fix the speaker and lights from the hurricane. They were always running back and forth trying to determine where they were going to put a box. Finally the straw that broke the camels back was the poor JACK HAMMER they used to go through the concrete at the pier. This must have went on for an hour and a half before we finally had to leave.

First time in Key West. Hotel is at the very end of Duval St, close to all the action. Purchased the \"Romance\" package for $279/night, which included breakfast daily (off the menu, not buffet) in the Hot Tin Roof restaurant and 2 drinks/each daily at the Pier Bar. Made reservation by calling hotel directly, I highly recommend doing that vs internet as we got a better deal than what was advertised online. Room was on top floor (room 514), we had reserved jr suite, but when we arrived we found that we had been upgraded to an oceanfront suite. King size 4 poster bed & tv in one room, living room had tv, mini bar small table. Each room had vaulted ceilings and ceilng fans. Bathroom was nothing exciting, and no jacuzzi, but I'm pregnant and can't use a jacuzzi anyway, so it wasn't missed. The view from the deck was unbelieveable. Our room overlooked the pier, panoramic ocean views, simply gorgeous. When the bellman brought us to the room we thought they had made a mistake, it was a great value for what we paid. Only one day did we wake up with a cruise ship outside our window, and it only blocked a small part of the view. Most of the ships tend to dock in front of the Hilton -I would be mad if I paid for an oceanview there! Service was really good, although we tend to be pretty low-maintainence. The turndown service was a special treat, with a shell left on the bed every night. Found most staff to be extremely friendly. Only ate at the Hot Tin Roof for breakfast, which was very good. Pool is on the small side, but very clean and again had a great view of the water. Service at the pool was spotty, it depended on who was staffing it that day. Chaise lounges were comfy. Tiles around pool do get hot on sunny days. Saw/heard very few kids, which was nice. It's not a hotel that I would choose to bring children to, not much for them to do there. Spa was nice, albeit a bit spendy. Had a great prenatal massage from Andrea. Parking at the hotel is expensive, $18/day, but you're in Key West and there isn't much parking. If we were to do it again we would have turned the car in at the Key West airport after we drove down from Miami. You don't need a car in Key West. Walk or rent a scooter or electric car. Only complaint was the live music at the Pier Bar was really loud at night. If your room overlooks the Pier you will hear it inside your room. They play 7 pm-11 pm, so if you're an \"early to bed\" type of person or sensitive to noise, you should book a room overlooking Mallory Sq or the city. Through the conceriege we booked a snorkeling/scuba trip on the Sea Breeze, which docks at the end of Front St next to Galleons Resort. A 5 min walk. Highly recommend it. $35 for snorkeling, and I believe $65-70 for scuba. Boat takes both snorkelers and scuba divers at same time, which is nice for couples in which only one is scuba diving. Reef is 7 miles from Key West. 2 dives, 50 min each. We went to Sand Key & Rock Key. Visibility was 40 ft, saw a ton of fish as well as barracuda, 2 nurse sharks, a huge spotted eagle ray (stingray) and a sea turtle. Good crew, including the captain's dog, Shayla. Mac was our favorite dive master. We went back a second time and they took $10 off. We also went on the Conch Train on a cloudy morning - skip it. $25 for 90 min tour was a rip off. Buy a guidebook and walk it/moped it yourself. Our favorite restaurant was Fogarty's on Duval. Get the crab-stuffed grouper - delicious!

Greeted by a friendly face, we were whisked off to our 2 bedroom 2 bathroom suite and junior oceanview suite. We were not impressed with the room at all. It seemed to be clean, until you looked closer and saw dust everywhere! We were excited to see we had a full kitchen, not that I would be cooking on vacation, yet still a nice addition to the room. A not so nice addition to the room were the hundreds of ants all over the kitchen. I called the front desk and they sent up the exterminator immediately. He outright said it was our fault there were ants in the kitchen because we opened a beer. Can you believe that?? I saw him the next day too because there was a roach in our bedroom...yeah yeah I know a palmetto bug. I live in NY, it's a roach. This is not a luxury resort/hotel for so many reasons and for $600/night I want to stay in luxury. I don't know if there are any real resorts in Key West. We had stayed in several other hotels on the island previously and had high hopes for Ocean Key. I cannot reccommend this hotel to anyone for the price. Now I get to the billing portion of our stay. Yes, I did travel with 3 other couples and there were 4 credit cards on the 2 rooms. But I was told everything was under control...until I checked my credit card statement. I was charged for another couples room. It was resolved rather quickly and painlessly, crediting me for the charges immediately. Then I discovered that they had charged another couple in our party incorrectly for this same room. It still is not completely resolved and we have been home for almost 2 weeks.

We had been to Key West back in 97, but just for the afternoon. The end of Duval, we decided, would be the best place to stay. At Zero Duval, the Ocean Key's location can't be beat. We were able to leave our car in the garage every day except for the time we made an excursion to Bahia Honda State Park. Lots of breakfast, lunch and dinner spots all within walking distance. We especially liked walking along the boardwalk at the end of Greene Streeet to the historic seaport, where there are several good restaurants (including Turtle Kraals--yummy breakfast and then in the evening we were there for their turtle race competition) and a spot where many of the sunset cruises and other excursions take off (we liked the stargazer cruise...something different). The marina right at Ocean Key also has lots of adventure....we did the speed boat tour of the island (leave your hat and sunglasses at the hotel!) from there. We ate at Hot Tin Roof just once...for breakfast our last morning. It was really good, better than most hotel restaurants. I second the other reviewer's comments about the blue tiles surrounding the pool being too hot. Granted, it was summer so you would expect them to be hot. But even emerging from the pool with wet feet, I got burned walking back to my lounge chair. I would suggest leaving your sandals next to the pool. As for the room itself, we loved it. We chose a junior oceanview (not oceanfront) suite, which overlooked Mallory Square, in my opinion a much better view than you'd get overlooking Duval. We went downstairs for the sunset celebration a few nights (can't beat seeing the street performers up close), and other nights just watched all the action from our balcony. Even though you can't see as much, you get taken into the scene with the live music and atmosphere. We were on the fifth floor and found the balcony to be very private (we could see people on one fourth floor balcony but none others). More than once we would hear someone below remarking that they wished they were staying at our hotel so they could see everything from the balcony. Interestingly, we did find that the Mallory Square action shuts down completely around 10. I guess everybody is heading to the bars on Duval by then. Since we don't drink, we found that our night pretty much ended early, once Mallory died down. You can't even get an ice cream anyplace if it's past 10. I believe 9:30 is when room service shuts down...I would have liked it if we could order something later than that so we could continue enjoying the balcony. One heads up for those staying in Key West during the summer: From Mallory Square, the sun doesn't set over the ocean but behind Sunset Key, a nearby island. So actually the views weren't quite as spectacular as we thought. Definite reason to do a sunset cruise at least one night. Back to the room: I agree with others that the island decor was beautiful. Bed was very comfortable, jacuzzi tub a nice touch. As a couple staying there, we could have done without the front room, which had a pullout couch, table and fridge. Obviously that fridge came in handy, but the room just had a tiny window overlooking the inner courtyard and walkways. So we found it rather dark in there, not really an inviting place to sit. Although I guess it provided a nice buffer so that we didn't hear any noise from other guests along the walkway as they came in each night or left each morning. We found the service to be very good at Ocean Key. The conceirge desk was a little too busy once or twice when we might have used it, but they did help us to select a restaurant and, right upon check in, helped me to surprise my husband with a room service meal (I arranged this in advance). The turndown service was good; also liked the seashells left for us. The bellhop staff was extremely friendly. And when we needed to get our car, the vallet service was quick.

We arrived early (10:30am) in order to try to get the room we wanted, which was top floor. We were able to get it, but it wasn't ready (cleaned) yet. The valet guy told us that the previous people had already checked out, so it shouldn't be long. We went out for a walk, and came back around 1pm. It still was not ready. We checked back all afternoon periodically, and at 3:55pm, (check-in was not guaranteed til 4pm), I suggested that we be given a discount if our room was not ready by 4, and just then it became ready. We watched people come in, check in, and go to their rooms all day long. I understand the rules of check-in, ie not guaranteed til 4, but still.....it seemed a bit, well, stingy, especially considering the level of room we had..... The concierge/valet/bellman that helped us to our room was very nice and helpful, full of info. There was one guy at the desk whom we queried about some things, and he was not knowledgeable, and even gave us some wrong info. He did suggest we ask the concierge guy, but he was not there at the moment. (Can you imagine he didn't know who the cat guy was??)

There was a great guitar player (my husband is a trained guitarist, and raved about him), an amazing singer, and then later, a woman who sang and played guitar, with a great bluesy, old-time voice. The drinks were good, and the service was fast and friendly. This pier is a short stroll from Mallory Square. What else can I say? We are quite picky travelers, and love nice hotels. We are not the people who say the hotel isn't important because you don't spend much time in it. We do. We like special hotels.

I'd stayed in Key West before, at the Hyatt, and - while the Hyatt was lovely - I was taken with The Ocean Key from the moment I stepped in to the lobby. I loved the decor and the relaxed atmosphere and the hospitality and friendliness of everyone who worked there.

His cell phone rang a couple of hours later; and it was the front desk to let us know our room was ready. Wow. We went to the top floor, to an ocean front room, and I was speechless. I can remember, during prior trips, standing in Mallory Square and watching the people on their balconies at The Ocean Key thinking, 'I hope that's me up there some day...' And there I was.

We had dinner outdoors at the hotel that evening. I asked my boyfriend where he would like to see his first Key West sunset. (We weren't sure if we should do it from Mallory Square, the pier, or our own balcony.) He opted for the balcony so, after enjoying a delicious drink at the outdoor bar, we went back up to the room. When we did, I walked in to find candles, roses, rose petals, a bottle of champagne on ice, chocolate-covered strawberries - and so on. We went out on to the balcony, opened the champagne, watched the sunset, and I was proposed to. The next morning when we went down for breakfast, the entire staff came running up to me to see my ring - congratulate me - and to ask if everything was the way my fiancee wanted it to be. Apparently, they went above and beyond my fiancee's expectations to be sure that everything was perfect. And it was perfect. We were married exactly one year later. I hope this doesn't sound more like an engagement story than a hotel review. Because, without the ambiance and the staff and the sheer beauty of it all, it could never have been as memorable as it will always be. We will stay at the Ocean Key every time we visit Key West.

So just be careful when bookign this place, it seems to cater to the rich snobs and push us normal folk around. WITH THAT SAID, this place was perfect location, extremly clean, with everything you can imagine. Good towels, soap, ect ect. Excellent pool area, with lots of 30 year old guys trying to hit on everything that walked by, which was a funny sight. they wouldnt let us check in early, because they said our room wasnt ready, but i know it was. They DID however call our cell phone at around 2:30 to let us check in. The view was spectacular from the porch. Bad TV channel selection tho. Oh yea, and there was a mysterious mini bar charge for 2.56 for something i didnt take. Hmm.. THEY DID only charge us for 1 night of parking tho, so i guess it evens out.

The location of the hotel cannot be bettered for me, you are right in the heart of Key West, the Conch trolley tour depot is just across the street, and Sloppy Joe's bar is also only a stone's throw away. Our room was the most attractive room I've stayed in, in North America, with some nice little touches, a Teddy Bear on the bed, wonderful toiletries & a stunning wash/vanity/bathroom area, which could be opened out or covered with shutters if someone needed privacy. The rooms all have jacuzzis, which we took advantage of, as well as double sinks & as many fluffy towels as anyone could need. The bed was a very comfortable Sleigh-style, not too soft with ample provision of pillows & layers of quilts (who needs a quilt in Key West!?!). The hotel has it's own pier, with a very lively bar situated at the hotel end, which is open the public & hotel guests, and there was live music nightly. Serving staff were lovely, not intrusive but very good at keeping the drinks flowing. You also have a great view of the enormous cruise ships which dock at Key West each day from here. The hotel has it's own watersports dock, yards from the pier & close to the the hotel entrance. They offer speed boating, boat hire, parasailing, jet ski, almost every thing you could want to do. We enjoyed the Jet Ski tour, $110 for 90mins with 2 of us on one machine. You are taken all around the bay & out into the atlantic and it was very very enjoyable, if a little scary at times! This is pretty good value for Jet Skiing in these parts. Small negative points for us, well, our room was only on the 2nd floor, so the view was 99% blocked by palm trees, so we could hear the sunset celebrations, but not actually see much of it, although we didn't spend a lot of time in the room as we were out enjoying ourselves. Parking is valet only, currently $18 per day, so include that in your budget. When we arrived, we were told our room wasn't ready. It was 1.30pm & we were told to check back later, but it would definitley be ready by 4pm!! We had driven down from Key Largo, so could have done with going straight to the room, this was the only annoying part of our whole trip, but they could advertise the late check in times more. I don't think 1.30pm is that early to try & check in to most hotels. I must stress none of these things would prevent us from staying here again. We didn't eat at the hotel, because we enjoy eating out & sampling the local cuisine, both Carolines cafe & the Hard Rock cafe are highly recommended in Key West, as is Fogartys Bar & Restaurant, all within a 5-10 minute stroll of this stunning hotel. All in all, This is THE place to stay here, everything right on your door, high standards of cleanliness & friendly staff, especially the valet parking guys.", "Date": "July 3, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Clearwater, FL", "Title": "\u201cGreat Ocean Key\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3617569", "Content": "This is THE place to stay, a bit pricey but worth the convenience and amenities.", "Date": "June 28, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Orlando, FL", "Title": "\u201cAmazingly Perfect\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3513148", "Content": "If you are looking for a hotel and not a bed & breakfast, try this great place.

Started our vacation right when we arrived at the hotel and our room was surprisingly ready at 9:00 a.m. The city view room was HUGE and actually we could see a bit of Mallory Square and the water from the balcony. The bathroom had a whirlpool tub and his and her sinks. The minibar fridge was not one that automatically deducts from your account when you move things so we could use it for the water we bought from CVS which is conveniently next door. The room was immaculate and I usually hate walking around with bare feet, but the tile was so clean it didn't bother me. Location is excellent and there was surprisingly little noise from the street at about 11:00 p.m. Mallory Square is crazy during the sunsets of course, though. This may be worse during the high season. Bring ear plugs if you want to be safe. You are near the water which is nice. The fitness room is more than adequate and the pool area is beautiful. We had a couples' massage which was nice, except that the couples' massage room was a little bit too bright and the music a bit too up-tempo. Staff is extremely helpful. You can rent bikes from Paradise Bike and Scooter which is nearby on Front Street. Ask for Will. :) 30$ for 15 for 24 hours. Great way to see Key West. Also check out Dominque and his Flying House Cats at the Hilton Pier (next to Mallory Square) at sunset. It's pretty impressive. Also Caroline's for good, relatively cheap food (great mahi fingers). The Garden of Eden clothing optional bar atop the Bull and Whistle is great entertainment. :) One more thing, if you like house or dance music the only place we could find was the Blu Room.

We never reckoned on going back so soon but a friend was getting married out there. On arrival at the hotel we were checked in by the very helpful staff and made to feel welcome at once. We'd had a long day flying and driving to get there so it was nice to be made so welcome straightaway. The hotel is total class. You really feel like you have well and trully spoiled yourself by staying here. The bedrooms are lovely. Huge emperor sized bed, lounge area and 2 TVs. The bathroom was gorgeous with a capital G.

Don't worry, if you are bashful there is a privacy screen. If you're not.....have fun! Lovely balcony with good chairs to sit on and have a drink. We had a partial sea view. The restaurant is great for breakfast which we had most days. Pool is pretty good, not too big but not crowded. The loungers are padded and layed out with fresh towels every day. Poolside service was top notch. Free sorbet and water to keep guests refreshed. The waiting staff were great at keeping up with requests for poolside snacks and drinks. It is 0 Duval Street.
