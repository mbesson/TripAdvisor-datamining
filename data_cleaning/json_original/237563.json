{"Reviews": [{"Content": "The WORST hotel I have ever stayed in. My husband and I are frequent travelers as a perk of our employment. We have visited Amsterdam several times and try to stay in different locations each time. For this last trip, we wanted to stay near Central station for the convenience of easily getting from place to place within minutes. This hotel is definitely near the station but not worth the $500 for a three night stay. Here are the numerous reasons as to why I would NEVER suggest this hotel to my colleagues, friends, or family: The only entrance and exit to the reception and to your room is through the restaurant. The hotel states on its site that it is recently renovated. I can't imagine what it looked like before it was renovated because I was not impressed at all. There are cracks and stains all over the walls. The wash closet/bathroom was only a bit bigger than one you find on an airplane. The shower stall was missing a door and no matter how you shifted the shower head, water got all over. The new, spare toilet paper roll that you always get was used and wrinkled from obviously getting wet at some earlier point. (You decide how it got wet in the first place.) The dingy bed had a head board that was actually just a free-standing piece of board that moved away from the bed if you press your pillow against it even softly. Here is the icing on the cake: on our first night there, we went out to dinner and did some walking around to enjoy the sights. Upon arriving back to the hotel, we decided to stop and have a hot drink and maybe some dessert in the restaurant as it was unusually cold outside. The manager asked us if we had decided what to eat and we said we were going to have just drinks and dessert. He could not hide the disgust in his face. The waiter came over and we ordered our drinks. When we tried to order dessert, the manager calls the waiter and says something to him. The waiter comes back to us, leans down close and says Listen. My manager is a (insert expletive). He says you can not order dessert if you do not order dinner. Sorry, he's a _______. Take your time and enjoy your drinks. Well, needless to say, we were very annoyed with this. The manager comes over and we tell him how terrible the service is. He interrupts and proceeds to tell us that it is not terrible service but we are taking space from others who may want to order dinner. (There were plenty of empty tables.) My husband says that we are guests of the hotel and we have every right to order what we want. The manage back tracks and says he didn't know we were guests. He then says he'll deliver the dessert and what did we order. Although I didn't want the dessert anymore at that point, my husband allowed him to bring it. The manager then came over later to offer us free drinks on him. This didn't change things with me. This is the rudest service we have ever had here or in any other country we have visited. My advice, spend your money and stay elsewhere!", "Date": "Aug 15, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR485498092", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "wine4us"}, {"Content": "Should be Shut Down! One word describes this hotel, DISGUSTING!. The room was filthy, smelled, and the linen was dirty. The pictures they show on their website is a complete fabrication.

When we informed the front desk, they just shrugged their shoulders and said it was from the construction across the street, not a care in the world. And YES, the reception desk is also the front desk at a resturant.

Continental breakfast was included, which was cold meats, cheese, bread rolls, cereals and fruit juice. This was nice, plentiful and well presented. You could have an English breakfast for 5.50 Euro's if you preferred. The day we were leaving, our flight was later in the afternoon. We checked out at 11am and were allowed to leave our cases behind the reception at no extra cost.All the staff were friendly and we didn't encounter any problems whatsoever.

We managed to break one bed during a wrestling match which they were cool about and we turned up most mornings at about 4-5 out of it and they were always helpful.The breakfast in the mornings was very basic but for about 10 euros you could get a full english and if you asked, normally they would give you free beer. The waiters were great help as they knew all the best spots to go and its right on the Damrak so it was about 2-4 minutes away from the RLD and about 5 minutes from Central station!Added with the fact that it was a cheap hotel to stay in and the restaurant downstairs giving 10% discount to people staying there, we would go back again! Remember though, its not the sort of hotel you stay in when ur planning to spend a lot of time in the hotel. A bed, bathroom, bar and beer. I give it an excellent, you get what you pay for!", "Date": "Mar 14, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR850792446", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Ecellant hotel, well recommended We stayed at the hotel de korenaer from the 17th of november 2004 - the 20th of november 2004, and them 3 nights in the hotel were excellant. The staff are very friendly and will help u with any problems you come across. The rooms are all modern decorated and very clean and cosy. our room was no. 27 which was a triple room and had a balcony with an extraudinry views of the damrak and right opposite 'Vans Beurs Berlage'. The hotel itself was situated in an excellant place it was just 2 minutes walk from central station, 3 minutes walk to the dam square, and about 1 minute walk into the famous red light districe. In the hotel price you get your breakfast included which was 7-10am and was fairly decent considerin you dont pay major \u62e2\u62e2\u62e2\u62e2\u62e2\u62e2 for the hotel, it was just cereal and continental stuff.The hotel also had a restaurant and served lovely food for a cheap price, and the hotel has 24 hour security so u come back to your room in the early hours of the mornin.Also the cleaner (Jamile) was a top notch guy, he used to come to our room and have a little joint with us and was very helpful and polite.So if anyone asked me if they shud stay in the hotel de korenaer i would say, yes deffinately, it was excellant valur for money, excellant service, excellant staff and in an excellant position.Have a nice timeAarronBennettGav", "Date": "Nov 22, 2004", "ReviewID": "UR188442414", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Not safe for kids! I enjoyed my stay in Amsterdam - no so my wife whose perception was immediately and irrevocably tarnished by the dirty carpet in the room. OK thats a typical bird for you, but I would say that this was the least enjoyable leg of our half term tour round W Europe.First of all do not repeat do not drive to this part of Amsterdam - the trafiic is 1mph hell. Secondly, although the staff seemed friendly, especially the waitresses paid great attention to our kids, this is a place for adults. There are potentially fatal safety hazards for kids here - perhaps worst of all, an 3 foot open panel six inches off the ground, which leads out to a 50 foot drop onto solid concrete.

I couldnt believe it was the same hotel. The stairs were blocked off and the door nailed shut. Was given one of the old rooms, despite booking one of the new ones. They would not accept any Plastic and insisted on cash. As it was late I had'nt got enough.Dont worry they said we have a money exchange desk.

I'm not sure what happened to the previous two reviewers when they stayed at this hotel but our experience was very different. We found the accomodation and staff to be excellent value for money. Given that we booked the hotel in August, during school holidays, we found it to be excellent for the price paid. We checked in early and the staff took our details and allowed us to leave our bags until the room was ready. The staff were very pleasant throughout our three night stay. Regarding the previous reveiwers comment we did see cereal laid out the night before but it was well covered and certainly not a health risk. We ate in the hotel and the food was basic but fine. The room itself did look onto the damrak on the 1st floor, it was small, clean and the noise levels bearable considering you are in the centre of town (which has its own advantages). The only problem we had was that we found the room to be too warm. Overall, I would far rather pay the price for a small but comfortable hotel than pay over the odds for a swanky hotel room that you don't get value for money from.

The rooms overlooking Damrak are impossible to get a decent nights sleep in as none have double glassing, in fact paper had been stuffed in the gaps by previous occupants.All in all only it is a very bad place to stay.
