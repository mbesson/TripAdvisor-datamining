We travelled from Mexico city to Cancun. We stayed in Tulum first, and a t our last day there went down to inspect play del Carmen and it's properties. Because we had done some bidget travelling and beacause playa is a touristic place we reconned we would be spending more then normaly and spoil ourselfs. We checked out diffrent hotels. We preferred to have a hotel at the beach so we did not have to rent chairs and an umbralle every time we went down (and you need onze because there is no natuaral shadow and it is blazing hot). In addition 5th avenue is close to the beach and it is around that area that you can find nice shops and restaurants. After reading some good stuff about the Blue Parrot in our travell guides and walking through the part thats on the beach, we got some info at the front desk. The girl was really nice, the room was 57usd including breakfast. We asked to check it out and it looked wonderfull so we booked 2 days. We actually stayed in the Blue parrot suites (room 131, I believe it was). This is a beautifull complex! We had an enormous bueatifull room! With a big kitchen (bigger then the one a have at home), equipped with everything you need if you want to do your own cooking; a big fridge (the only one we have ancouterd stay at different hotels and hostels througout Mexico and really handy to have you own cold drinks when it is that hot!); a king size cofartbla bed, table and chairs, plenty of storagge room, AC, a safe, a tv and free wifi. The bathroom was nice and fresh towels and soaps were provided dailly. The room was cleaned every day and you get a bottle of free water daily. The breakfast which was included was really yummie and was served at the beachbar where you could begin your day with magnificent shoreviews. Towelservice and use of the umbrellas and sunningbeds was also included. In addition, the Blue Parrot throws partys at night on their part of the beach, and were others have to buy entrance tickets you can get in for free if you stay there. They also have amazing fireshows. We had a nice sitting are outside of our room, which was near the pool and their was also a jucuzzi which could only be used by our room and the room next door. Out of curiosity we asked if we could trie it. The guard said he thought the jacuzzi was broke, but gave it a trie. The jacuzzi filled up, and although the bubbles were lacking (yes indeed the thing was broke) and we had to do it we the light show, we enjoyed in any way. We parked our car on the road in front of the hotel as their was no parking, and although their is a guard 24 hours near the hotel entrance or walking around in the hotel, somebody tried to break in our car. So it's probably better to leave your valuebales in the room. We loved it their so much that we we went down the front desk a couple of times to book some extra nights and ended up satying for almost a week. At one time when we asked to lengthen our stay we normally had to change to the room next door because the room we stayed in was booked. But the next day we found a note under the door to inform us we could just stay in our room. We loved it and hope to return some day!", "Date": "July 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Austin, Texas", "Title": "\u201cThe manager experience ever!!!\u201d", "Author": "Glolofe", "ReviewID": "UR114996610", "Content": "I stayed at the blue parrot before, and lets face it, its a nice beach 3 or 4 star hotel, you cant ask much for what you are paying for.

I had the most amazing time at Playa del carmen's night clubs, and Blue Parrot club wasnt the exception until that night.

I have stayed in hotels all over the world, in several different countires. My husband and I have been to Mexico 6 times and will never use this hotel again. We have stayed a at The Fiesta Americana, The RIU Canun, & La Tortuga. There are many things you can overlook, but this place was a mess. We are not hard to get a long with. When we checked in I asked if it was loud at night due to the night clubs in the area? The woman at the front desk replied no, your hotel is down about a block. The first night it was quite, then all hell broke loose. The second night about 10:00 pm we heard yelling and screaming in the court yard. I looked out the window and there were about 15 girls who has just arrived. I noticed they were staying in two rooms. All 15 of them. I figured spring break everyone can get crazy for a night. Well all night until 6:30am they were screaming, yelling, chanting and blowing a whistle. The night club was just down the street. Why they didn't leave and go there is beyond me. That morning at breakfast all the other guest were complaining. The lady at the front desk just smiled and said they are not spring breakers. They are local girls who came for the week end. Again about 10:30 pm the party started. I went on the balcony and it was the same group. I went down stairs to the security guard and asked him to do something. He told me he didn't speak english. I tried to explain and even took him by his hand to show him. I went back to my room. At 4:30am they were still going. I tried to call the front desk no anwser. I went to the security guard again he just shrugged his shoulders. I walked a block to the night club, where the front desk is located. I told security again and they brought out the guy over everyone. He walked back to the hotel and I pointed out what was going on. About 6:30am all was finally quiet. I went to the front desk to complain and was told they were well aware of the problem, due to everyone complaining. I asked her if we could move to another hotel. I explained to her I couldn't go through another night like this. She informed me they would not refund my money, nor would they give me any type of discounted rate. We were stuck. She did tell me the girls had one more night there and then they would be checking out. We had the same problem all over again the next night. I again had to go to the bar to get security and it was the same guy from the night brefore. This time he even had a rum and coke in his hand. I could smell it when he walked up to me. I told him either he do something or I was going back to my room and call the police. I think the party died around 5:00 am. When I woke up there were beer bottles all over, and someone has goitten sick by the pool. I think the hotel should have asked the girls to move to the Blue Parrot up on 5th Ave or even asked them to leave. I paid $153.00 a night for 5 nights at this place. I will never come back and do intend to tell everyone not to use this hotel. I'm 38 years old and enjoy the night life, however this was not enjoyable. In October my husband and I stayed at the La tortuga and I cannot say enough wonderful things about it. We thought we would give this place a try, but what a mistake. There are much nicer hotels, on a better stretch of the beach. Take my word, looks cute, but not a good place to stay.

The first thing we noticed was how our nights sleep were so peaceful, and that the suite complex were very clean. Our suite in particular was very spacious although some of the decor was probably dated back to 1984! The hotel is well located within minutes of 5th Avenue, the many restaurants, bars and clubs, and the only noise was from guests on New Day at about 10am who decided to play their house music as if they were still at the party! This happened again a couple of days later but the problem is reception is located a block away from the suite complex so trying to explain the exact source of the noise was a bit difficult especially on the occasion when we were woken up, but they managed to get it the music turned down, and on the second occasion they asked security to intervene and peace was restored to the complex. On New Year Eve guests were advised that breakfast would be available at 11am but in fact the party was still going on when we duly arrived, and we were advised to come back at noon! the same situation happened a couple of days later when we arrived at 7.30am and the party was still happening, but there was no reception to advise us! A concern was reception was available from xxx until 11pm and I often wondered what guests were supposed to do if they needed emergency assistance after 11pm!! The setting for breakfast was fantastic it was a restaurant on the beach but one morning at breakfast one of the waiters was very aggressive in trying to solicit a tip telling us that the tips he received was his sole wages, also on the same day the Dj decided to test the equipment for the party - the music was so loud, and we were not impressed! At the beginning of our booking on at least three mornings we had no hot water, which was quickly resolved! Also for a couple of days the pool was being used for scuba diving lessons and as guests we weren't given advance notice or whether the pool could be shared on these occasions. On New Years Eve we dined at the hotel's restaurant on 5th Avenue we paid in advance because we were arriving on 28 December and didn't want to find ourselves without somewhere to dine on New Years Eve. The restaurant was set in beautiful surroundings however, the meal was a real disappointment, the soup was salty, the salad was swimming in salad dressing, the prawns were over cooked, the rice and vegetables under cooked needless to say with our 10% discount we didn't return to sample the food at the restaurant based on that experience. The management and staff were very helpful in dealing with our concerns although I didn't quiet believe that the reason for the constant parties at the Blue Parrot and surrounding area was due to a music festival, which I explained that if this were the case then guests making a reservation during this period should have been advised so they could research the type of music festival and make a decision whether or not to use the hotel. Having returned home and looked on the internet it seems it was the BPM Festival from 31 December - 9 January 2011, which explains why the atmosphere surrounding the Blue Parrot felt like Ibiza constant partying, which is good if that is what your holidays are about! It would further would have explained why at about 1am on New Years Day the area leading down from 5th Avenue to the Blue Parrot was like carnival really really crowded!! With a fairly high police presence! I think the Blue Parrot needs to determine whether during this period they try and target clientele who are seeking to attend the festival by promoting it's location as a selling point! However on this occasion in our opinion they didn't get it quiet right in managing both the club and suites with the latter losing out!!", "Date": "January 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cMy Idea of Heaven !\u201d", "Author": "deedash", "ReviewID": "UR87881952", "Content": "We had a fabulous time at the Blue Parott Suites.

We were down there for the Bicentennial celebrations of Mexico's Independence from Spain and we were right in the middle of everything.

Playa is a little maze of cobblestone streets packed full of restaurants (all kinds), shops, specialty department stores, water sports, adventure sports and entertainment. The cleanliness of the place is outstanding and one of the very few places that offer this kind of luxury in an unpretencious beach setting. The breakfast/lunch restaurant is right ON the beach and its specialty is to offer American breakfasts/lunches as American as they can be, as well as Mexican too, as Mexican as they can be; we were wondering how they manage this and were told, right by the owner, that they import their key ingredients. The suites are spacious and comfortable and have a full kitchenette in a very modern setting. Since Playa is a flat town and the setting is a lush tropical garden there are only a few rooms that may see through the palm trees into the ocean. Pricewise for us, this property is a top value since it doesn't have many ammenities other than TV, but at the same time why bother? In this case you are not charged for anything that you are not going to use and almost everything is available within the first 80 yards that you can walk in any direction in a really charming Mexican town atmosphere. It was absolutely worth every penny we paid for our stay, not to mention having your own restroom just steps away from the beach, the restaurant and the nightclubs and having a few world-class amusement parks for kids and adults just a 15 minute taxi ride away and a whole island to explore just a 40 minute ferry ride away.

Quick rundown on the Blue Parrot - Blue Parrot has 3 buildings in Playa - the Hotel & Beach Club, 5th Avenue, and Suites. They are all on the same block (12 calle and 5th ave area), but BP Suites is much better if you want to be able to sleep at night. The other 2 locations are wonderful if you want to be able to walk out of your room and into a bar/nightclub, but I wanted some distance between Playa's nightlife and my hotel room, so I chose the Suites instead. Absolutely wonderful room - looks exactly like the pictures you see on their website. Stayed in the studio for $110/night (lowest rate I found was by contacting the hotel directly) - spacious room, full kitchen (stove top, microwave, utensils, dishware), balcony with lounge chairs, living room area, and nice big bed. We were only 2 people, but the room could have fit up to 5-6 people. Literally 30 seconds from the beach. I left our room and walked probably 25 meters before my feet hit the sand. I would recommend this hotel to anyone. Sure, you can pay $200/night at places like Kinbe, Deseo, or Mosquito Beach, but really, everyone at Playa will end up lounging on the same beach, under the same sun, scuba diving with the same companies, in the same locations (el jardin, tortugas, barracuda, etc.).

We had booked a four night stay, but had to leave after the first night. We stayed in a \"deluxe beachfront studio\" which is the most expensive room they offer, right on the beach. The staff was friendly and did their best to make us happy, but the noise was just too much. You are pretty much required to stay awake until 4 AM, which is when the disco music played out front finally ends. The music does not come from the Blue Parrot bar, it's from the Coco Maya night club sandwiched between the Blue Parrot Bar and the Blue Parrot Hotel, which as far as we could tell is not affiliated with the Blue Parrot. I suppose if you can sleep through loud bass-thumping music, or plan to stay up until 4 AM anyway, it might not be a problem for you. I noticed that someone wrote that the noise was not too bad. The only thing I can think of is that the night club must have been closed (or not yet in operation) on the night of their stay. It's true the noise from the Blue Parrot Bar is not too bad as it's pretty far away from the Hotel, and I think the Coco Maya club might be a pretty new thing. The club is popular and fun, you just have to be willing to live right on top of it. On the positive side, the Blue Parrot is located right in the center of town, a short walk from lots of restaurants and clubs. It's also only about 5 or 6 blocks from the Supermarket and Wal Mart. The best thing about the room was the front balcony. It is large and has a fantastic view of the beach. However, our balcony was missing the foot rest of one of the two chairs, and was also missing a cushion on the other chair, which made it a little less than ideal. There were also two dingy twin mattresses laid out on the balcony when we arrived, but these were taken away. In general, the room seemed run-down, and had a pretty bad smell. We never found the source of the smell to be honest. The wicker furniture was kind of sticky (and I'm not sure I want to know why). The refrigerator was rusty, the shower did not get very warm, and there was a really nasty corner of the bathroom floor tile. If you are a clean freak of any kind, this is not for you. There was actually a bird living in our room if you can believe that. The ceilings are very high and made up palm leaves (palapa), and a little bird had made a nest somewhere up there. The building itself looks pretty nice from the outside. It's definitely more run-down inside than out. It is a courtyard design with a small, skinny pool in the middle. The pool is more for show than swimming. Each room has a balcony, and the views are very good as I mentioned. There is a building under construction right next door (inches away), so if you are on that side of the hotel, you will have to put up with construction noise all day. There is another building under construction on the town side of the hotel right across the street. The beach is nice with plenty of beach chairs. We did not try the restaurant. We probably could have put up with the odor and general run-down-ness if it were not for the noise, but we knew we were going to want to get to bed before 4 AM on the rest of the nights of our vacation. The staff were helpful, and there was no problem with us canceling our reservation. They were very understanding and didn't even charge us a fee even though we had reserved the extra nights. They suggested the Blue Parrot Suites, which are a block off the beach. We didn't see the rooms, but based on the location I think it would be quieter. It would be fine to stay somewhere a block or two away from the beach like the BP Suites, as the beach is public and you can still enjoy it all day.

Our room was at the beach end of the regular hotel section (room 311 - I highly recommend it), and we absolutely loved it. It was a good size studio (with kitchenette) with charming, cozy decor, excellent air-conditoning, books on the shelf, lovely, clean bathroom, and a fantastic little patio with an exceptional view of the blue sea. The beautiful architecture of the hotel building makes for a really wonderful backdrop and great feeling in general. We never had any problem with noise from the beach bar... I'm surprised to hear that people have that problem. I just never heard it loudly. We did have a lot of banging from the next-door construction project, starting as early as 8 am and lasting all day. But we generally got up and out of our room at that time anyway, so it really never became a big problem. I could see it being one if you sleep late. We're more of the late afternoon nap types, and by then it had generally quieted. There is an enormous amount of construction going on all around the hotel, but it didn't really bother us. The beach was great (once again, lots of construction noise as they rebuilt the beach bar palapa that burned down, but what are you gonna do? It looked like they would be done with that project soon so it shouldn't be a problem much longer.) Otherwise we enjoyed the beach a ton. Drink service was good, nice music at perfect volume. Chairs are very comfortable and were always available. Nice people around us, not loud jerk types. The waves are very minimal at the beach here, and there are a number of fishing and diving boats at water's edge, so it's not quite the unspoiled ocean beach that some might be looking for (just up the beach at Shangri-La area the beach is a liitle more like that type; Tulum even more so), but the water was lovely clear blue, sand was soft and ambience beautifully relaxing. We just loved being in the middle of everything but still in a beautiful, relaxed environment. Our only real negative opinion of the Blue Parrot was the restaurant, mediocre at best with very spotty service, which was strange because service everywhere else throughout the hotel was excellent. We didn't really care, though, because it was fun to go up to the main drag for coffe/breakfast (Java Joe's and Hot Bakery were excellent), and Playa Maya restaurant just down the beach was terrific for lunch. Oh, one more thing: The guest services guy was annoying, trying to rope you into wasting some of your vacation time at some sleazy property sales pitch/time share presentation. He kept approaching us by name, and called us at our room, to try to convince us of what great free incentives he had to give us. Ugh. I can only imagine how disturbingly aggressive the sales-pitch people are at the actual presentation if the hotel guy was this bad. It just seems so crummy that they disguise it as \"Guest Services.\" The only service we got was lip service. Advice: Stay away! All in all we thought the Blue Parrot was wonderful and a very good value. We would stay there again in a heartbeat, especially in that exact room which we felt was ideal for us.

Also, I honestly didn't like the rooms...they're really run down. Yes, the location is nice, but not worth what you have to sacrifice to stay here.", "Date": "February 19, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Minneapolis, MN", "Title": "\u201cHorrible Experience\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4389606", "Content": "We just returned from our vacation in Mexico at Blue Parrot Suites. The Suites are a newer property - less than a year old with Tommy Bahama decorating. We stayed in a room that was sold to us as a \"penthouse suite with a rooftop terrace.\" Unfortunately for the Blue Parrot, the beach bar and restaurant they are famous for burned down two days before our arrival. As disappointing as that was, we elected to stay there for our reserved two nights. Upon check in, we were not informed of any effect the fire would have on our room. After unpacking, we soon learned that the tvs and phones were not working because of the fire and would not be restored during our stay. That night we learned that the air conditioning unit in the bedroom was lacking a remote control as a result could not be set to cool the room. We also found out that the rooftop terrace was worthless because the light did not work. The deck off the room itself was also useless as it had a table but no chairs and only one hammock. The light on this deck didn't work either but we took a bulb from a lamp in the room and changed it out to get some light. The terrace itself was disappointing - it had a table that rocked, one hammock and plywood boards laid out as benches. It also had an outdoor shower area that was likely damaged in the hurricane as the broken tiles were broken and lying everywhere. Overall, a very unaccomodating and unappealing terrace. The next morning we went to the office and complained and were told that we had to talk to the manager that would not be there until the nextday. No one was sent to our room to fix any of the problems. That night, a heavy rainstorm occurred. While we were asleep, rain poured into our bedroom and living room under both doors and soaked all of our clothing and our bags. We had to go to the airport wearing the dirty clothes that happened to be in the bathroom and with soggy suitcases filled with wet clothes. Because this was our honeymoon, some of our clothes that were dry clean only were ruined. We explained all of these problems to the rooms manager at check out. She made a call and was authroized to give us a 20% discount off our total stay. I would like to say this was sufficient to compensate us for all these problems but frankly, it was not. The room was advertised as a penthouse deluxe suite and the rate we paid for this room was more per night than we paid at any other five star resort we stayed at on our trip. We expected a room that lived up to a 'penthouse' level and the substantial price. We received a hotel experience that was worse than a budget hotel and if not for our positive attitude, would have ruined the end of our honeymoon. The most postive aspect of this entire experience was the great customer service we recieved when we were booking the room. Next time we are in Playa we will stay at the Acanto or Mosquito Blue as both of these facilities were very nice.", "Date": "January 26, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego, CA", "Title": "\u201cBlue Parrot is the name.

We had a great time and loved the hotel. I can understand some of the poor reviews, there are some draw backs which I will mention below. We were 4 people, myself, my wife and two kids, 18 and 12. We took a suite in the new Blue Parrot Suites which I recommend whether you need the space or not. The Blue Parrot has a major night club and is at a hub of night clubs which can be very loud on some nights. Friends we met that stayed in the Blue Parrot hotel said the music could make it hard to sleep. The Blue Parrot is also not cheap. We thought it was well worth the price. It has a perfect location in Playa, easy to walk to all the shops and restaurants in Playa but away from the busy main street 5th Avenue. It has one of the best beaches in Playa. There are also secluded court yards and balconies where you can just chill. The hotel property, including there beach front and rooms are well maintained. They are still working on some Wilma damage. But otherwise it is just a beautiful place to be. However, if you don't need all the amenities there are less expensive alternatives. As mentioned in another review the day time manager Mercedes is wonderful and so helpful. She arranged restaurant reservations, car rentals, what ever we needed. We liked having the night club near by as our 18 year old daughter spent late nights there with other girls she met. We felt completely safe. The hotel security is always pleasantly present. At the club they put on a Fire Dance show every evening which is spectacular. All in all we loved Blue Parrot and would return.", "Date": "January 1, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Portland, Oregon", "Title": "\u201cBeware!

I had booked a studio room well in advance, and after reading several previous reviews, I confirmed several times--including the day before we checked in. The studio rooms are small, but acceptable--the showers are quite large, actually, as is the balcony. We were in a second floor unit just off the street, number 209. Noise was a continual problem, as our next door \"neighbors\" in 210 were constantly drunk, fighting, yelling and slamming their doors. Had we been staying more than three nights, I would have insisted we be moved. NOTE: The doors in this place are very loud, and the sound reverberates through the stairwell--and a person speaking in a normal voice out on their balcony sounds like they're right outside your door. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. There is no \"Breakfast Included,\" as advertised on the hotel's web page---they give you 20% off of your breakfast if you are staying there. The food was quite good but not earth-shattering. The beach is fine--the sea has seaweed, for heaven's sake, and if you can't handle seaweed don't go to the sea. The fishing boats are a quaint part of the atmosphere, and they did nothing to interfere with enjoying the water. After all, Playa used to be just a fishing village. Playa in general has grown so much that I doubt we will return there. Finally, I have to agree with previous reviews that state that this hotel is somewhat overpriced. It is probably priced to reflect the proximity to Avendia 5, the fact that it is well--known and the hotel's expansion to a third location going in on that street.", "Date": "May 22, 2005"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Blue Parrot Suites", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g150812-d154882-Reviews-Blue_Parrot_Suites-Playa_del_Carmen_Yucatan_Peninsula.html", "Price": "$113 - $154*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">12th Street North and 1st Avenue North</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Playa del Carmen</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">77710</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Mexico</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "154882", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/62/f9/62f9a394185e26870ce9da21ef0fcc131large.jpg"}}
