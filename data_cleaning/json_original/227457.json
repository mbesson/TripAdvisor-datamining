We went straight out and found the local area we walked for miles the hotel is fantastic for sightseeing very central and very very close to metro.(plaza de espana) We had a great evening out finding local places 5 bottles beer 3 euros bargains The next morning as every morning we had a lovely breakfast at the hotel every thing you could want and very tasty . The heat outside the hotel was unbearable but inside aircon was lovely. We took the big red tourist bus for 20 euros hop and off all day great way to see the city and there are 2 routes 1 and 2 do both you get to see where everything is and what you want to see they also do night tour at 10 pm included in the price . We also went to Madrid footy stadium again well worth going . The bar at hotel was not to expensive and we had 1 drink in there but mostly we was out . I cannot fault this hotel or the staff . The street outside was a little dirty and Smelley at times NOT the hotels fault but they were cleaning out side on many occasions and some one had washed street the morning we was leaving with bleach.

The hotel is a little difficult for taxi drivers to find. It's located a block from Plaza Espana and convenient to the Royal Palace, Plaza Mayor, the Almudena Cathedral, & the Puerto del Sol. Please note that this hotel is located across the city from the museum district. A taxi ride to the Prado Museum costs around 6-7 Euros. The hotel is in an urban neighborhood with lots of small shops/bodegos. We got Cafe Americano & Cafe con Leche every morning at the bodego on the corner.

Room was a bit dark, key was very big which made it uncomfortable to carry around all day. Toilet was not spotless, but the other hotels we stayed in were 4 star so can't expect too much. Beds were fine, unlike other posters here we slept soundly and did not hear any noise. Stayed on a Monday night though. Also unlike other posters here, we found the staff a bit rude and did not speak English well. I speak a bit of Spanish but have trouble understanding the accent. I spoke to two members of staff here and I needed them to repeat themselves before I understood. When we arrived, I told the check in staff that we had a reservation. He then looked at me weirdly and asked if I had a reservation. I said, yes, that's what I told you, and I said my name. He then typed something on his computer, looked confused, rummaged around his desk, and then saw a single piece of paper on top of the counter, which he had been looking at for the previous guest!. I had already located my name on that list, so to make things easier I decided to give him my passport as I just learned that Spain requires hotels to check the passports of guests. However he then gave me a weird look again and asked me whether the reservation was in my name or my girlfriend's name. I was thinking that it doesn't matter as I already gave him a name. He finally decided that maybe he should open my passport if he didn't understand how to say the alphabet in English (my name is spelled unusually, for which he can be forgiven). He then recorded my passport details but didn't bother to open my girlfriend's passport. Lastly, he spent about 2 minutes trying to explain that we needed to pay when we left. The other hotels we stayed in did not bother to say that, so it was unexpected. I expect he says this to every guest so I wonder why he has not learned how to express it properly in English. The other member of staff I spoke to also behaved oddly. We didn't fancy the hotel breakfast so went outside at 7.30 to find a cafe. The man shouted very loudly at us \"when leave the hotel you give me the key\". I said, \"we're going to get some breakfast\". He replied \"breakfast upstairs\". I said, \"we're getting breakfast by ourselves\", at which he looked confused and didn't say anything for a while, so I said, \"we're checking out at 10 o'clock\". He then nodded and looked away. This made me feel like we were thieves or something. We had no bags with us the time, and the previous day nobody said anything when they saw us walk out in the afternoon. Anyway, I think we could have had a better hotel if we searched and booked earlier, but this was adequate. Apart from those two interactions nothing went wrong. In fact, a chambermaid we passed on the landing was quite friendly even though we only managed to communicate briefly with our basic Spanish.", "Date": "December 23, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ingolstadt", "Title": "\u201cNothing wrong with Hotel Cason del Tormes\u201d", "Author": "ChrisIngolstadt", "ReviewID": "UR90404207", "Content": "I'll keep it short...

We stayed at the 'Cason del Tormes' hotel which was extremely clean and friendly. We had a problem with our transfers from and to the airport and the reception staff at the hotel sorted it out immediately with no problems at all. The hotel itself is situated down a side street just off the main street (Gran Via), so it wasn't too noisy. So if you're looking for a busy city break but still wanting a good nights sleep this hotel is very reccommended. We will definitly be returning.", "Date": "November 2, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manchester, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cVery good location\u201d", "Author": "swnw99", "ReviewID": "UR4080076", "Content": "Just come back from 4 nights at the Cason Del Tormes. All in all a good place to stay in Madrid. On a quiet street just off the Gran Via so just a few minutes walk to bars, restaurants, shops, stop for the tour bus or the metro. Also just 5 minutes walk to the Real Palace and lots of gardens/parks within 5 minutes walk. Staff very helpful, lobby area very nice, and has free internet access. Breakfast average continental fare, ours was included in the package, wouldn't bother if you had to pay extra for it. Only complaint was lack of restaurant for dinner, but plenty of choice within a few minutes walk. The bar in the lobby never seemed to be open, you had to ask the person on reception if you wanted a drink and they then arranged for someone to come and serve you. Would have been better if it had been open with someone on there during opening hours. Having said all that would definitely stay here again as the location is very good.", "Date": "November 2, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Buenos Aires, Argentina", "Title": "\u201cGreat choice\u201d", "Author": "MartinAdrogu\u00e9", "ReviewID": "UR3618330", "Content": "This is a very good hotel with an excellent price, and I really recommend it. The service is very good, the staff -though a bit scarce- is friendly and helpful. The hotel is small and very confortable. The rooms are quite big, specially for European standards, most of them external with nice street views. The beds are confortable and the bathroom is OK. The location is the best point. It\u00b4s in a hiden but extremely convenient place: just a few steps from Royal Palace, the Senate, Plaza de Espa\u00f1a, Gran V\u00eda, Royal Theatre and many other attractions. There are a parking and a metro station just around the corner. A silent refuge in the heart of noisy Madrid.

It is just off the Gran Via and there is a Metro stop at the end of the road, which was very convenient for getting around the city and to and from the airport. Off a side road, it was also very quiet. The staff were very friendly and helpful and offered to look after our bags when we checked out which, is always good when you have the rest of the day until your flight. Our only advice would be to avoid the breakfast. It worked out at six Euro's per person, which we wouldn't have minded except that it was rather basic, all self-service and clearly, out-of-a-packet, even the coffee was from a vending machine. We could have ate out and had breakfast for half the price.
