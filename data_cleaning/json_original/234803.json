{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Great idea..a hiccup in the execution We recently were on our way to Provence and had a 20 hour layover in Amsterdam. I booked the Mercure Schiphol based upon the reviews here, and the fact that it was in the airport itself. We had a 7 AM flight out the next morning and needed to be near check in. The idea of the hotel itself was great- just beyond customs doors. The hotel was clean and, although the room was small, the beds were very comfortable. There were only 2 problems with our stay. We booked directly through the hotel website,- which indicated a price for a one night stay with check in after 10 AM When we arrived at 11:30 AM, we were told that we could not check in until 9 PM, as they rent for daytime and night time,- but for both you pay double the price (about 200 euros for both). I showed the hotel manager my website confirmation that listed the price and check in for 1 night beginning at 10 AM. He indicated that I was the 4th person that month that had the same issue. He graciously honored the price and gave us a room for the 20 hour period. However, after traveling all night, it was problematic to think that we had paid for a room believing that it was for a regular 24 hour period,- only to find out that it was only for 12 hours. Anyone thinking of booking here should be careful to note this issue. The 2nd problem is more of an inconvenience. If you leave the hotel to go into Amsterdam, you must have your boarding pass, passport and hotel key to get back to the hotel. You must go through security and passport control, as the airport is in a secure area. We had a long layover and wanted to see Amsterdam,- so we had to be careful to take all appropriate documents. If you come back late, passport control is only open at the opposite end of the airport, which is like 3 football fields away. I would not hesitate to stay at the Mecure Schiphol if we had another layover,- but in the absence of a layover, it might be more convenient or more cost effective to look at other hotels on or near the airport grounds.", "Date": "Sep 27, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR385255669", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Marigot1"}, {"Content": "Convenient place for a stopover Convenient hotel for a stopover.

It is located after customs. Basically you can step out of the shower, into your clothes, and just walk to your gate. Every airport should have a place like this, it sure beats sitting on plastic seats under fluorescent lights..The room I had was tiny and the furniture basic and of course there is no window. But it was quiet and clean.Be aware that:- Rooms are rather expensive for what you get (you pay premium for the location)- You must reserve as the hotel only has about 30 rooms. At my second visit I had no reservation and I couldn't get a room as they were fully booked.They also have a system which I don't like. They divide the day in day use and night use. So even if you just stay for instance 4 hours but these 4 hours happen to overlap the day and night periods you will have to pay twice!", "Date": "Mar 22, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR660734705", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "World_Citizen8"}, {"Content": "Visa Trouble? Desperate? This is your hotel You would never stay in this hotel (or even know it exists) unless you can't leave the customs zone in Schiphol Airport upon arrival to Amsterdam. That's at least how I ended up there.It's not a four star hotel as it advertises itself but it beats sleeping on the chair. You'd get a tiny but clean room, ours had a shower too, with a very small TV. People come and go, hopefully you are so tired after your flight that you can't care less, since the walls are paper thin, which is typical of many lower-end properties in Europe.And all this does not come cheap, about 70 EUR for day use (10 AM-7 PM) and around 80 EUR for night use (8 PM-9 AM). The hotel has only 33 rooms, which fill up at times. It's on the second floor above the arrivals/departures area, across from F wing.
