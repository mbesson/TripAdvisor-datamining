On the negative side rooms are not to a great standard with regards fixtures and fittings. Nice flat screen tv but not tuned in, two shower heads but one didn't have a bracket, mattress on double needs turning or replacing as it had two people-shaped dips in it. If something is broken it seems to be left or repair botched. Little things that you don't tend to see at a quality hotel. There is no lift and a narrow staircase to rooms, not great if you have more than one small bag. Also a noisy hotel, you can hear traffic and people outside, as well as other people in their rooms. This hotel is fine for those looking for a crash pad in a decent location that is a little cheaper than some of the chain hotels, but not a relaxing getaway, family trip or business travel location.", "Date": "September 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bath, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cNice friendly hotel\u201d", "Author": "clea2003", "ReviewID": "UR115222885", "Content": "We just wanted a twin room near Paddington as we were going to a concert in London. This hotel had very pleasant and friendly reception staff, and the room was clean and fairly quiet. We were allowed to leave our luggage with reception on day of check out, and unlike some hotels the reception door was locked when there was nobody available even for a few minutes, which is reassuring. On the downside there was some noise from the air conditioner which seemed to be right outside, and because the entire hotel decided 9am was the ideal time for breakfast the staff struggled a little - not something that was a major problem though.

I arrived last night after a far too long business meeting in Brighton to find that there was \"a problem\" with my room and that I had to be relocated to either Bayswater or Baker Street. I was desperate to get a room and some rest and not knowing London very well after confirming that a similar quality room would be allocated to me, I opted for company's Bayswater hotel. I arrived to find the most hideous hotel ever and the most clueless receptionist ever (she has serious problems to understand basic english). I called back to Paddington 27 who relocated me to their Baker street hotel (hotel 82) where I found out that there was no room for me and then I had to relocate to some apartments further down the street. I would have never booked an apartment at the first place but being utterly desperate and having no idea where to go and spend the night I took the option. Ended up to a smelly and noisy flat (no reception of course). The final blow came next morning when I called (from my mobile, no telephones in the apartment) to ask for breakfast (at the Hotel82, not the appartment) starting time where I have been told 7.30 but regrettably there was a mistake and started at 8 with me waiting. Breakfast extremely of poor quality served in a dark basement (the kitchen door was open but I was afraid to have a look, you never know). Ah, not to forget on my way to Hotel 82 I got across the police arresting people...very nice scene!! In all fairness, they have deducted an amount from the initially agreed price for the accomodation.Not that is compensation for the trouble I have been through.", "Date": "November 13, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Carlisle, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cClean and friendly but room a little on small side\u201d", "Author": "CMI28", "ReviewID": "UR85618371", "Content": "The hotel was very bright and fresh having recently been done out and the staff were polite and friendly. The room was in the basement, it was pretty small no where to put suitcases so I had mine near my bed which was a bit annoying and the other underneath a table beside the bed otherwise we wouldn't of been able to walk around the room. The room was very clean and bright with modern decor and it had coffee and tea making facilities , there was a small cupboard for putting clothes in and this also housed a small fridge which came in handy. The bathroom was lovely with a massive shower the only problem we could see was that if you had somebody who was a little on the large side they might struggle to get through the sliding door to the shower as it only opened so far so it would be a bit of a squeeze. The bed was comfy and clean and the wall opposite had a small flat screen T.V. The problem with the room being in the basement was you could sometimes hear the underground trains and banging from chairs and feet as our room seemed to be somewhere underneath the breakfast and reception area - this was annoying because it meant you could hear people coming and going at all hours.
