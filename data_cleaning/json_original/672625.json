{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Fantastic - Beyond Our Expectations! My husband and I stayed at this hotel for 1 month in October of this year. The room was large and comfortable with a beautiful patio overlooking the pool. The owners, Michael and Brahma, were excellent hosts, friendly and welcoming. The daily yoga lessons with Michael were a great start to the day and Brahma's cooking was better than any restaurant we ate in. The hotel is immaculate and an oasis of tranquility just outside the tourist area. We would stay at this hotel again in a heartbeat and have already recommended it to many of our friends!", "Date": "Dec 28, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR327522528", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "britbabeFlorida"}, {"Content": "Wow We booked to stay for 4 nights, but extended to a week because this place is just amazing. Very cheap and the food was out of this world. Michael and Bhrama made us feel like royalty. The rooms were large with aircon and the pool was beautiful. A taxi to town cost less than two pounds. We would come back to Bali just to stay here.", "Date": "Dec 22, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR605253004", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "pappap647"}, {"Content": "Excellent Value but out of the way location We really enjoyed our 1 week stay at the Tropical Bali. It had a great pool, quiet location and very friendly staff and owner. They served a great breakfast. The only negative was the location - it requires a taxi ride to and from the nearby town of Sanur. However taxi's were inexpensive. We did walk into town once along the beach but this turned out to be a long hot 1 hour walk in the sun ( no shade trees). There is also no internet computer available on site. Overall, we loved hotel and staff and would definitely recommend it. Great value.", "Date": "Dec 18, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR145046873", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "RonsTrip"}, {"Content": "The best place I have ever stayed!

I loved it, it is quiet, tranquil and in a beautiful setting. The owners are very friendly and welcoming. The breakfast was fabulous, I chose nasi goreng, it is always different wherever you try it, and this version was great. The facilities are excellent, the pool lovely and the massage wonderful as well.I will definitely be returning to this little piece of paradise in paradise and staying longer as well.I like to stay in places that are owned by locals and know that my money stays in Bali to benefit the locals. I also like to stay in smaller places because they are usually more personal, less noisy and less busy with less people milling around.I found this hotel perfect for me and recommend it to all my friends and anyone who wants to know a good place to stay in Bali.", "Date": "Jun 15, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR880336239", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "dlm_8"}, {"Content": "Brilliant, quiet atmosphere - excellent find! The hotel was beautiful. The rooms were comfortable and the gardens and pool were lush. It's a small and quiet complex, with only about 10 rooms or so, and is set away from the town. Having said that, it is conveniently located for Sanur and Denpasar but I recommend taking a hotel card for the taxi driver otherwise it is difficult to find. The owners were really friendly and helpful and the breakfast was lovely. Had a great stay and would definitely return!", "Date": "Apr 20, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR529225546", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Taffietulip"}, {"Content": "Tropical Bali Hotel. New Good. Wonderful. This is a place so cool, so calm and friendly.Situated in a local village just 15 min walk on the beach from the melting pot of Sanur.The rooms so spacious in a tropical garden. With a pool, of course.Perfect information and transportation possibilities.The boss was a cook overseas before he went back home so just order your favourite dinner.I felt like home here, yet so far away like a strange paradise. You walk down the local road ,say hallo to Mr and Mrs Indonesia. Try a grilled corn cob or a chichen soup in a steet shop. Go to the beach without any crowds, speak with the fishermen.All turistic bling blings are close but I always longed back to the place which I\u9e93m going to make my home many more times.This place is very new and too good not to be known, but I do really hope the Lonely Planet won\u9e93t find it.", "Date": "Oct 30, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR835932494", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Bali-Johnny"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297700-d672625-r23051056-Tropical_Bali_Hotel-Sanur_Bali.html", "HotelID": "672625", "Price": "$34"}}
