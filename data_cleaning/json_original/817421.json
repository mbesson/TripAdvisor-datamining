There is a pool and exersice room, free breakfast, a bar in the evening. 24 hour free coffee and free shuttle to the airport. As you will notice from previous reviews, there has been constructions for at least 2 or 3 years now. I call this \"job security\" for the construction workers as it is very slow paced. This is not the hotel fault, they actually opened before this mess started up. If you know what roads to take, you will be fine. From highway 20, go towards 520 est, after the underpass, keep the right then go in the Best Western parking, at the other exit, just cross the street. From 520, exit at the airport, follow signs for Cardinal street (left at Aloft/Sheraton hotels), once you get to a spot where you can only go left or right, take the left, cross the bridge, the hotel is on the right. Hint: Cardinal Street is the same street of the hotel. Once at the hotel, they have a map how to navigate around and help you leave and come back. I recommend this hotel.

The bad ecomony of the last years have reduced my traveling , to Gold (50 nights) , now I am currently a silver member. My stay at this hotel has been one of the most frustrating of my total of 250+ nights with Marriott. First, I was told that I had to pay $15 per night for a refrigerator, that I require for storing medication. I have never been told of any costs in all the previous times this has been granted. The Marriott Rewards Agent said she had never been told of this before as well. Someone from Marriott called the Hotel on my behalf. I was then called by the Fairfield to say my request was granted at no cost. On the next day coming back to the hotel from downtown Montreal, it told us over an hour to make it the 1/2 mile to the hotel Due to extensive construction, that the hotel staff did not mention at check-in the evening before, ( we arrived by hotel shuttle) it is possible to get to the hotel using any of the maps or garmin (which i updated with North American maps the day before we left). We drive by the hotel over and over again. We finally stopped at a Aloft and asked the bartender for directions. He told us this was happening all the time and advised us to go back go to the Trudeau Airport Arrivals, that was the simplest way to get to the hotel. Which in utter frustration and desperation we did! Sitting in airport traffic! When we finally got back to the hotel. The front desk staff tried us as if it was our fault. We asked if there had a map with the new detours. It was at this point that they pulled out the map that we should have been given at check-in to warn us AHEAD OF TIME. The extension construction detours was not only time-consuming but DANGEROUS! Multiple lanes of traffic being merged into single lanes! The trick is to drive into the Best Western Parking lot and drive around it. Who would have guessed that it was possible. I asked why there were signs. I was told there was 1 small one, but the Front Desk agent admitted it was very small. Unlit it is impossble to see at night. I can not imagine why the Fairfield would not care about the safety and the inconveniencing of their guest, to simply advised ahead of time at reservation or at check-in. The General Manager has yet to contact me. The positives: The property is a very stylish Farifield. Has a business center with 3 pc, a bar with a light menu and a very nicely maintained breakfast room. The ladies who work in the breakfast room are very nice, greeting everyone brightly and hard working, spotless.

It is a basic hotel, good if you have to stay close to the airport, certainly not the best choice if you want to visit the city. The room we had was normal size, with a big and really confortable King Size bed with european style duvet. Standard american bathroom, plain and without any amenities but clean, and usual built-in small closet. The only in-room complimentary amenities are: coffee and tea maker, wi-fi internet connection and a flat-screen TV set with a good range of Northamerican channels. There are no mini-fridge nor safe-box. In spite of being so close to the airport, our room was pretty quiet during the night, it turns a little bit noisy due to the traffic on the road during the day. A minus of the hotel is about eating: there is no room service and inside the hotel there is just a sort of cafeteria located directly on the lobby, where you can have a drink and some light food - but if you want a proper meal you have to drive somewhere. The breakfast is included in the rate and is served at the cafeteria: the choice is pretty good and includes boiled eggs, yogurt, fruit and even hot waffel, the only problem is that there is not so much room and at peak time it can be really crowded. If you have a car (which you would need for sure!) there is a private parking lot just in front of the hotel for 9 $ per day.

The hotel is one of the closest to the airport (less than a mile), and only about a year-and-a-half old. Since we arrived at the international section of YUL, finding the shuttle van stop was a bit of a chore, but a call from the airport hotel direct line solved it immediately. (It leaves from section 10 or 11. Sections don't become obvious until you exit). Staff was incredibly friendly. Our room was modern, bright, and probably the cleanest hotel room we've stayed at years. On the desk was a welcome note (personalized with our name) and complimentary water bottles. As noted in reviews, there is no eating or shopping establishments in the area. But unlike most Fairfields, this one had a bar/bistro which stayed open until 11 PM. Grilled sandwiches, pizza, or salads were served by the bartender, who also served us a half-life of house red (not bad). Hit the spot. For the price of the meal, we also received great conversation with the bartender, who retrieved a map and outlined things to do in Old Montreal before our cruise the next day. He, plus the rest of the staff made us feel we were staying in and exclusive in-city five-star hotel. In fact, they were probably friendlier. The morning breakfast was not as extensive as that of some hotel chains, but in line with Fairfield. Room price was among the lowest in the area, excluding the dives. We were not bothered by planes (our room was on the airport side), nor the train which is very close to the property. Heard just one all night.

This review is based on a three-night stay in May 2010. I can confirm what a number of previous reviewers wrote; here are my highlights: Pros: - Close proximity to the airport. - New hotel (meets or exceeds standard for all new Fairfield Inns, for those of you that frequent the Marriott brand of hotels). - Great service in French and English. - Good-sized rooms with an expansive channel guide for the TV, and larger washrooms (with light above the shower) makes for a comfortable stay. - Nice-sized pool and exercise room in the basement for this class of hotel. - Neat feature most Fairfield Inns do not have is the cafe/bar in the lobby which serves drinks and light meals / pub fare until 23:00. - Low price is always nice. Opportunities for improvement: - Train noise immediately behind hotel will likely disturb light sleepers (day and night). Request a room overlooking the main parking lot out front. (My wife and I had one night there - fabulous; two nights on the train side - not so good.) - $9 per day for parking (or any paid parking) is unusual for a Fairfield Inn. - Marriott Rewards Platinum members will be surprised to find that you are only offered a choice of points or a music download card upon check-in (and not the usual selection from the Market) - perhaps this is a property or Quebec-only thing? - Not the fault of the hotel, but navigation in and out of the hotel can be difficult based on the multiple roundabouts and constant construction (not much has changed in the last 12 months), even with a GPS. - Some distance from Montreal town centre. Overall, I have rated the hotel highly and would stay here again (and recommend the property to family and friends).

As for other reviewers complaining about certain things, here's what we think. Yes, the hotel is a terrible location. The trick to get to the hotel is to cut through the Best Western's hotel parking lot, across the street. AS for noise levels, we had our room facing towards the front side away from the train. We had no problems sleeping, nor could we complain about the outside noise. However, we do suspect that people may have suffered louder noise if their rooms faced the train. Request to have a front faced room, and this will solve your problems. My girlfriend's a light sleeper and she had no problems sleeping. The staff was friendly and helpful (they gave us nice info with places to eat, close by, and they provided a map). Rooms were very clean, and their was even a nice little pool. Also, there was a small workout room too. Continental breakfast was delicious, with the Belgium Waffles. \"Come for the Waffles, stay for the beds\".

The hotel has an indoor pool - that's something my two kids always prefer, no matter the season. It's smallish but still decent. The free continental breakfast was slightly above average; the usual assortment of breads, cereals, juices, coffee/tea, plus a waffle maker. The hotel was nearly or entirely full during our stay, so the breakfast room was packed 3 of the 5 mornings we were there. The hotel's location is a plus if you're using the airport. If you're instead spending most of your time downtown, the hotel is a tad remote. However, you can leave your car and take public transit ($2.75 per trip as of 8/08) - by catching the 211 or 221 Express bus at the Dorval train station (a 200 ft walk from the hotel) to the Lionel-Groulx Metro stop (Green line) and then taking the Metro into town -- a published trip time of 32 minutes). We only discovered this option on the last day so couldn't take advantage of it. See http://www.stm.info for more details; use the STM trip planner (\"Tous Azimuts\"...both in English and French) to build a schedule. Both that bus line and metro operate past midnight. Parking costs $8 per day, unlimited in/out privileges. Make sure to have your room key card encoded for parking lot use, or you'll have to request a key code in person every time you want to exit -- that can be a hassle if the front desk is busy. As others have said, the hotel is hard to get to the first time you try -- it's on a one-way street and you merge onto that street just PAST the hotel entrance, so you have to loop around. If you type in '700 Avenue Michel Jasmin\" (the hotel's address) into an online map service (Google Maps or the one at the Fairfield website) you can see what I mean; the directions those services provide are accurate. I found the hotel staff overall very helpful.

Had not previously stayed in a Fairfield and was really impressed by the friendly, helpful staff, the convenient services, and the good value. Facilities were very nice -- I thought the small fitness room was well equipped for this level of hotel. Indoor pool looked well maintained. They provided some good restaurant recommendations and a map to the nearest gas station (not far), but roads are very confusing in that area since there are so many highways coming together. Room was clean, comfortable, and a good size. Cont. breakfast was good, including belgian waffles you can make yourself. My only complaint was the noise from the trains -- quite loud even at the highest floors.

The location of this brand new hotel was a nightmare. It is situated on the edge of two roundabouts (all signs in french) which facilitate entry to the airport. Please keep in mind that we grew up in this area and are very familiar with the \"Dorval Circle\" flow of traffic but there are no words to describe how difficult it is get get to this hotel. If I found it a challenge to get to, I cannot begin to imagine what a tourist would go through to get to this location. When we finally did arrive I asked the desk clerk to give me his rendition of directions and if I'd followed his directions I'd still be in the car!! I can't fault him however, because I don't even think I could give directions in this case, it simply defies words. Oh the noise.......This hotel is located directly beside a major train station and freight line. With freight trains passing 200 feet from your room all night don't expect to get any sleep. The hotel itself is brand new, the room was very nice, exceptionally clean and the staff are friendly. No faults there, everything you would expect from a Marriott hotel. (I'd give the hotel itself 4 stars). The rate is quite reasonable however the trade off of location an noise is just not worth the savings. I would have gladly paid an extra $60 per night to get some sleep.
