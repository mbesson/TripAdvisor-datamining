This year, issues at a friend's house precluded us from staying in their guest bedroom, and thus we booked ourselves at the Marriott Liberty Station. We found the location to be ideal to get into downtown, just turn left from the hotel, follow harbor drive and you're there in no time, without even having to get on the freeway. Likewise to get into Ocean Beach, PB, or locations north; simply turn right out of the hotel to get to the beaches or head north on the 8 freeway to La Jolla. In short, we found the location of the Marriott to be ideally centered between the two areas of San Diego where we spend the most time. As they say, the three most important aspects are location, location, location. On top of the fantastic location, the staff at the Marriott could not have been nicer or more accommodating. They upgraded us on check in to a room overlooking the water, and handled our requests with ease. In the room, we found a flatscreen TV, a small fridge, and (most importantly) a Kuerig coffee maker. From the small balcony we could watch the sun set over the Pacific. Remind me again why we moved away from San Diego? Outside of the hotel, the liberty station area has almost every shop and restaurant that you could need, and others, like Target, In-n-out, and rubio's fish tacos, are just a mile or so east on Rosecrans st. Just across from the hotel in the parking lot is Sushi Ya, an amazing sushi restaurant in a town that has never blown me away with it's sushi selection. Also, a Starbucks, and a few other restaurants are within the same parking lot. If you are looking to explore San Diego, there are few locations as good as this one.

The rooms are excellent, spacious, well appointed with a flat screen tv, mini refrigerator, A/V hookups to watch videos if you have your camcorder or laptop with you and want to watch footage on the TV, cable including HBO, very spacious bathroom, granite counters, and even granite window sills. The staff is SUPER friendly, the lobby and main areas are immaculate, the fitness center has 24 hour access, unlike many hotels that limit access, the jacuzzi was awesome as was the pool, the location has the harbor to the rear, a huge open park and trails, plus a beach area, and it's in a very upscale looking neighborhood. The business center is free to use, ie free internet access and a printer, plus free wi-fi in the rooms. There's a market attached to it that has starbucks plus other sandwich type deli items, plus a little store for knick knacks if you've forgotten something or need a little something extra (protein drinks, candy bars, chips, batteries, etc). Parking is FREE!! Which is impossible to find at a hotel in this class. So i basically had no complaints whatsoever and really can't imagine how anyone could complain on this hotel. Sure you hear planes, you're near an airport. They stop flying around 10p and they start around 630am, but again it's not anything major. The planes aren't directly over head so it isn't super loud. I've decided that each time i return back to san diego, unless i'm renting some beach condo with a ton of friends, i will definitely be staying at this hotel again and again and would recommend it to any and everyone.

I took a day off from work to accompany my husband on a 3-day business trip. If you have a car or rental, this hotel is a great value. It's on the opposite side of the airport from the convention center and mega-hotels costing 2 - 3x as much, right off Harbor Blvd. It takes about 10 minutes to get to the downtown / convention center - a nice waterfront drive. The Courtyard is located behind a shopping area with some restaurants, so you can't see it from the street, but it isn't hard to find. Now and again you might hear a plane, but it wasn't an ongoing issue. The outside is plain-ish, but nice - typical Courtyeard. The rooms are well appointed and new. There is a TV and hook-ups for electronics, and there is free wifi, as well as a business center where you can use a computer (if you didn't bring one) and color printer for free. There is a Keurig coffee maker and a fridge, as well as an iron, ironing board, and hair dryer. A microwave might have been nice. The bed was comfortable. Towels were big, but skimpy. Everyone on staff was nice, and the front desk helped me configure my laptop, which wasn't recognizing the wifi. Turns out it was the computer, and they showed me what to do. One downside was the breakfast was $12.50, and for a party of 2. It was not worth it to pay more for the room in order to get a \"free\" breakfast. Another issue was that there wasn't an ice machine on every floor. After a long day, it was not fun to get back to the room and have to go down the hall and up a flight of stairs to get ice. I paid just over $100/per night for a king size bed and sleeper-sofa, which would be great for small kids. A room with two queen beds would work for a family with older kids. When I dropped off my husband at the convention center, I did think it would have been nice to have stayed at the Hilton or Marriott virtually next door.

Every other staff member that we came into contact with was also great, Stephanie just stood out. The hotel was very clean. We always check for bed bugs at every hotel, no matter how nice the hotel and we did not find any. The bathroom was very clean, even the grout was nice and white with no mold. Housekeeping was great! There was ample parking and it is included in the price. The only thing that may have been nice would be for them to take license plate numbers for the hotel guests because we found a car with the lights on and there wasn't a way for the desk to find out whose car that was. We didn't think we would utilize the on site laundry, but after a day falling in the water at the tide pools, we needed to. The facilities were very clean and the soap and fabric softener is complimentary. We did not use the gym or the pool but we did look at them and I was very impressed with the quality of the gym equipment. It looked to be some really high quality gym equipment, there were ample numbers of treadmills. The pool and pool area looked very nice and I appreciated the no smoking signs because this area can become a smoking haven if allowed. There is a small restaurant on site, we did not use it. They do not have complimentary breakfast, but there is a starbucks within walking distance and it's probably the best starbucks that I have ever been to. They do usually have complimentary coffee/tea available. A very slight draw back is the TV, because of the set up, we couldn't channel surf, we needed to choose each channel by picking the number. It's just a slight inconvenience, no big deal really. I was a little concerned about the location of the hotel, it seemed from internet resources to be so close to the airport and not so close to the city, but in reality, it's nice that it's close to the airport and the planes are not annoying. The airport has a curfew because it is actually inside the city, so there are no take offs and landings at night. I would not consider this hotel outside the city at all, it was right where I would choose to be again. It is pretty close to the USS Midway, and some great restaurants. The city is pretty compact, so it was easy to drive to anything in the city from the hotel and there was easy access to the highways, too.

The desk clerk was helpful with recommendations. My only real complaint is the run of the mill room I received as a Gold Elite member. I have come to realize that Couryard's are much more hit-or-miss in offering what should be a guaranteed upgrade (space permitting of course, but this was the middle of the week and space was permitting) than are full service Marriott's.

It's the perfect location, particularly if you have young children. There's a nice, big playground in the Liberty Station area that only takes 5 minutes to walk to on a nice paved running/biking path from the hotel. Some of the playground is on soft turf and some is on sand, so take your sand toys. The front desk told us they had sand toys we could borrow, but we never did. Next to the playground is a bathroom as well, which is convenient with young kids. The playground was extremely clean and had a nice number of kids playing on it. The playground overlooks a river or inlet of some kind, so nice for the parents to enjoy as well. The beautiful jogging trail goes for miles! If you want to walk a little further, you can walk 10 minutes from the hotel on a paved path and go over the foot bridge to the bay where there's a beach (Spanish Landing) and the kids can safely play in the water. There's also a playground and a bathroom facility at this area as well. Trader Joe's is a 10 minute walk from the hotel, which was convenient for us to get some groceries for the mini-fridge in the hotel room. There are many other stores in the same complex as Trader Joe's, but we never checked them out. Liberty Station (where the hotel is) has several restaurants and we highly recommend Oggi's. When the power was out in all of southern California for 12 hours or so, they were trying to accomodate customers by working in their kitchen by flashlight. Very hard workers and good food! The front desk staff was wonderful and helpful. They remembered us by name and greeted us each time we came and went. We did rent a car and loved the free parking at the hotel. The hotel itself and the individual rooms are clean and modern. The WiFi worked smoothly for us as well. Their breakfast buffet was reasonable and we thought it had a nice variety (oatmeal, pastries, cereal, fresh fruit, hard boiled eggs, bagels, english muffins, juices, coffee, etc) for the price of $10. Was $12 if you wanted the hot food (eggs, waffles, sausage, bacon). The pool was the perfect temperature and never over crowded when we were there. Although, it is starting to get a little cooler in San Diego at this time of year, especially when the sun goes down, so take layers! We could hear airplanes from time to time and could see them out our window, but it didn't bother our 3 year old during naps and didn't keep us awake at night. I think the volume of planes flying significantly drops from 11 PM- 7 AM , which helped. If you are a super sensitive sleeper, take ear plugs, but we didn't think it was an issue. The location of this hotel is great with it being next to the airport and only a 5 minute drive to downtown. All the conveniences you need are right around the hotel. If we return to San Diego, we'll stay at this hotel for sure and will recommend it to everyone we know.

We booked the 2 room suite with a king bed. According the the front desk, there are only 3 of these types of rooms in the hotel. The hotel is very close to San Diego International Airport. The hotel provides a shuttle between the airport and hotel. While a bit disconnected from the rest of San Diego, the hotel is still conveniently located. Most major attractions are within a 20-25 minute drive. Our initial impression of the property came during the check in process. The lobby has a sit down restaurant, bar, and \"shop\" with snacks and sundries. Just off of the lobby, there is also a deli. The staff in the lobby were helpful during check in and checkout, however, when we were trying to check in at our guaranteed 4pm time, they indicated to us that their engineering team wanted to paint a portion of our ceiling and the room would not be available for another 2+ hours. After discussing it with them, I was able to convince them to move this maintenance item until after we checked out. We we got to the room, we couldn't even find the spot where they wanted to paint. The room was in excellent shape with a fold out sofa, chair, and desk in the \"living\" room. The bedroom was also quite spacious and open with a king size bed and 37in (I believe) television. Both the living room and bedroom had a mini fridge. We were unfortunately booked into a handicapped accessible room, which meant a open shower. This caused most of the floor to get soaking wet as the water drained out of the center of the bathroom. Not something we are used to, but clearly understandable need. The bed was comfortable but a bit firm for our taste. The soft pillows did make up for that, however. The bedroom had great blackout curtains, which allowed us to sleep in without having the sunshine wake us up too early. The down side to have the large suite was the lack of view. It was placed in an area of the hotel that blocked any kind of view. This wasn't important to us as we were out of the hotel room most of our trip, but good to note. One of the biggest selling points of this hotel was parking. Most of the downtown hotels have limited or no self parking. Those which did charge anywhere in the range of $25-$35. We were willing to drive a few extra minutes to our destinations to get the free and ample parking. The Courtyard by Marriott at San Diego Airport/Liberty Station lived up the to the high standards that I have come to expect from from Marriott properties.

Starbucks and multiple quick service restaurants are in the same parking lot, just a five minute walk from the doors of the hotel. The room was spacious and clean.

As mentioned in the other reviews, the rooms are very nice at this property and they keep it up amazingly well. I had to ask how old the property was, and was amazed they said 4 years old as it looked like it was a brand new & they just finished everything a few months ago. About the only drawback to this hotel is it's location. It is in a good central location, but at the same time it's not close to anything except the airport. So expect to make a bunch of 5-10 min. drives to most items. Or go park near the Old Town trolley station & ride the trolleys. That's the best way to go downtown. Two items. Jim the bar manger/bartender is a master at classic cocktails as he spent 30+ years at the Del Coronado as a bar manager and is way above what you would expect to find at a business hotel. The other is the hotel will take you on the shuttle bus to any of the resturants on the Shelter Island/Harbor Island area. Highly recommend the Bali-Hi, With the restoration, the view & the high quality food it's a great Tiki Temple, and Jimmy's Famous American Tavern is basically across from the Holiday Inn about a 1/4 mi. away is a fantasic gastropub & has a nice harbor view.

Ok, I will describe this place from my personal experience. First off, I am still currently residing at this location for a long term stay and even after a month and a half I the staff all around has continuously gone out of their way, literally, to help me out with ANY personal issue or request I have had. If the amenities do not grab your attention the friendly staff most certainly will. Please do not let \"friendly\" be considered a loose term. Every staff member here is very personal and it is not because it is their job, but because they are warm and caring people and really do want you to enjoy your time here in San Diego. Every recommendation to every ridiculous request is spot on for everything I have ever needed. It is almost as if they cannot do enough to make sure your stay is wonderful. The food? Glad you asked! They have a wonderful array of options for breakfast, lunch (which i dine here for every day) and dinner. Outstanding steaks to half off happy hour appetizers to outstanding salads. I've even made absurd requests just as a test, which I do feel a little guilty for, and all have been met with a 5 star ending. Yes, five out of five. Oh, who likes hot tubs? I do! Nice glass of wine by the fireplace, ok, if you want to, it is available here. They even provide you with a ride to the surrounding areas for dining or entertainment and even to go shopping if you like. Also, as an extended stay guest, I was greeted with extra gifts to help me be as comfortable as possible. A big thanks goes out to the sales manager Bonnie for that. And to everyone at the front desk (Matt, Joe, Christina, Stephanie, Cara, Chris, Kurt, Jamie, Marlene, and don't worry, Sandy and Mitch I don't forget about you) thank you for being so awesome. Susan, thank you for the outstanding sandwiches for lunch, Jim, Anna, Sara, and Hector, thank you for the evening dining company and great service at the bar and restaurant, And Ms. Claudia, although you may or may not read this, you do an outstanding job with the room. If you are still reading this as a guide to find a place to stay, don't waste anymore time searching, this is the place you want. This is the place you deserve to come for business or pleasure.

We sat out in the sun a bit but was too cold to use the pool and it was small, not for swimming, more for dipping. -Great to have Trader Joe's & Von's nearby. We stocked our mini-fridge and ate breakfasts in the room. - Did not eat in the hotel restaurant or use the bar but we did eat at Sammie's Woodfired Pizza near Trader Joe's - excellent! - Nice walking path that goes past a Marina and down to Spanish Landing Park and beyond. Would be great if they had bikes available for use. - Airplanes do land and take off frequently but not until about 6:30 a.m. It was never loud enough to wake us up. - Free parking is a great perk. You will want a car here unless you do not mind walking a few miles to catch the trolley or to take a bus. The Old Town Trolley tour has a shuttle pick up next door at the Homewood Suite but they only pick up and drop off at a specified time per day. - We did not have a balcony but there was a decent park & water view ; there were a few rooms with balconies overlooking the water(I would guess those are the suites). - Room was spacious enough for two people and, other than some loud people coming in late, we had no troubles with noise. My only real complaint is it was not warm enough! I've stayed a few places in Sam Diego and so had my sister.

I believe that the first and major measure of a hotel (above location and price) is cleanliness; this hotel was spotlessly clean; the bedrooms, pool area, restaurant and lobby were immaculate; the towels and bedding were crisp, clean and comfortable. we were given two interconnecting rooms on the second floor with a good view over the pool and bay. the rooms were spacious, airy and the bathrooms were a good size, with good toiletries and plenty of towels. the rooms were cleaned every day (apart from christmas day when just the bins were emptied). the hotel is a very close to the airport (at most a five minute drive) and there is a frequent free shuttle to the airport; we used this when we over nighted in vegas and on our return we contacted the hotel to send the shuttle to collect us; this worked brilliantly and the shuttle was waiting for us as we exited the terminal. the airport is much busier than I thought and there was some noise in our bedrooms from planes taking off and landing, but no real inconvenience or disturbance the hotel is on a modern complex, alongside a hilton,a number of restaurants, a starbucks and a massage spa ( Envy - $50 for a full hour long massage - brilliant); the only thing lacking was a convenience store on the site. however, there is a very small mini shop behind the reception in the hotel. there is loads of free parking (the internet is also free as is use of the desktop computers in the lobby where we printed our airline boarding cards). the hotel also accepted a couple of faxes on our behalf (again free of charge; I recall being charged $20 for a fax at the bellagio several years ago!) location of the hotel is good; a couple of minutes from the airport and maybe double that to down town san diego and the midway. the drive to the fantastic zoo (where my kids fed the giraffes; available every day between 12pm and 1 pm- unmissable) took 10 - 15 mins. the price of our stay at the hotel was ok - we paid maybe a little more than we expected, but when you add on free parking ( another hotel we considered down town wanted $30 per night to park) and the free internet, the price was about right. there are no safes in the room, but I used a safe box behind reception for the duration of our stay (although there wasn't much left to put into it towards the end of the holiday), and again this was free of charge. I don't get the impression that in the san diego we saw petty crime is a problem. we ate in the hotel a couple of nights; the restaurant had virtually shut down other than for breakfast over the holiday season, but the restricted menu and the food we chose from it and ate in the bar area were pretty good and reasonably priced a holiday in san diego in the winter is the epitome of cool, and the laid back friendly tone of this beautifully clean hotel means that we'll be more than happy to \"come home\" here again.", "Date": "January 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Phoenix, Arizona", "Title": "\u201cRest and Relaxation for a Young Family - - and a GREAT LOCATION to boot!\u201d", "Author": "5877", "ReviewID": "UR92172592", "Content": "By far the BEST location and hotel experience for a young family like ours - - where proximately to all the great things in San Diego is important (Balboa Park, Seaport Village, etc.), but totally WITHOUT the hustle and bustle \"rat race\" of the city.

Although our hotel room was no where near ready upon or arrival (as we had selected only one of the three suites on property, the day after New Years Eve celebrations at the hotel - - late check outs, etc), our love for the extra room in the suite with our new family was key. The mini-fridge, pull out couch/family room, and great view of the water at sunrise was a welcome touch. (And we loved the little Kuereg coffee machine to get us going in the morning.) But by far - - the ability to just get out and walk along the water, enjoy the history and patriotism of the Liberty Station naval training area, and sampling any number of the great food around the hotel was the perfect combination. One suggestion - - our personal vehicle was key, as this location is just far enough away from key locales, that having your own transportation was a must in our book.

This hotel is pretty new, so everything is in great condition, both inside and outside. There is a full-service restaurant, a bar with three large screen TV\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s for the sports fans, and a deli, where you can get Starbuck\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Coffee, sandwiches and salads, and breakfast pastries. The room d\u00c3\u00a9cor was very modern, efficient, and comfortable. All of the staff members we encountered were extremely friendly and helpful and, staying there five nights, we never had a single complaint.

Courtyard Liberty Station: 1. is very clean and well taken care of, which the Residence Inn was not. 2. has a very nice pool area. 3. has balconies in some of the rooms that offer a beautiful view.

Quite simply, they are the best bang for the buck. When you stay at a Marriott you aren't sleeping at some dive nor at a world-class hotel. This was my first trip to San Diego. Came out here for Comic-Con. Ultimately I booked the Residence Inn downtown for the duration of Comic-Con but decided to add an extra day of R&R and booked the Courtyard Marriott located 4 minutes from the San Diego airport. The experience here has been mostly great. As every review prior to mine indicates this is a new hotel and it's quite nice. It certainly lives up to or exceeds any Marriott I have stayed at. Upon arrival I was booked in a really nice room on the second floor complete with balcony overlooking the pool. That was a real treat within itself. I didn't ask for such a special room but they gave me a choice of several at the front desk. The room itself is wonderful. It had a couch and a great workstation to plug my laptop into. The hotel is situated in a very nice waterfront area complete with walking track. I wish I had more time to walk the area as it seems very beautiful. Instead, I chose to go down to the pool and spend an hour or two there. The pool is tiny. By the time I got there kids were already swimming in it and I decided I probably would not enjoy a swim. So, I laid in the sun for a bit but shortly thereafter more kids arrived and I decided to leave. Too many kids yelling, screaming and diving in the pool just isn't my idea of relaxation. Then again, this is the kind of hotel that is going to attract families so who am I to complain. Have kids? They will enjoy the company of other kids. Want to relax? Too many kids. Was going to hang out in the bar, but it didn't seem like a happening place. Some of the Marriotts have a happy hour with food and drink specials but this bar didn't seem to have any of that going on. Bed was very comfortable. Absolutely no plane noise. I found out the planes stop flying by 10pm so no need to worry about losing sleep. In fact, the most noise I incurred was the slamming of doors throughout the night. The walls are thin here -- I could hear voices -- but I managed to sleep well nonetheless. Room has a high definition LCD television and all sorts of ports to plug in your video camera or PC. Free wired and wireless high speed Internet is always a welcome bonus. There is even a Keurig coffee maker in the room with a selection of coffees and teas --- buy wouldn't you know it, my coffee maker was broken. I hear these Keurig coffee makers, as nice as they are, don't stand up to repeated use. In the morning, since I did not have a working coffee maker, I went to the lobby where they have a Waterside Deli that served very good coffee, but its pastries were abysmal. I skipped the buffet breakfast. Parking is free which is another huge, huge bonus. The only major negative surprise here is the elevator. It's a single elevator (though there seems to be two at separate locations) but to get to it you have to go through a tiny, standard doorway. Some poor guy walked into the hotel with a skid of luggage. In trying to get through the doorway to the elevator he had to take all his luggage off the skid. It was ridiculous. I have never seen such a small accessway to an elevator inside a hotel. With one elevator at your disposal it can be slow wait at times. In all, I would make this my first choice of stay the next time I come to San Diego. It's almost a hidden secret how great a hotel this is. I hope it stays that way because it's very rare that you can get such a nice hotel like this with free parking and Internet for this price point.", "Date": "July 20, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Phoenix, Arizona", "Title": "\u201cgreat location\u201d", "Author": "shamers2", "ReviewID": "UR71052467", "Content": "We chose this hotel after reading good reviews here and noting which areas of SD we were planning to visit. Wasn't interested in Gaslight with the kids, didn't want to pay for parking or an old room at Mission Bay, and wanted to be fairly central to the historic sites. The location was central to downtown SD/harbor, Old Town, and Point Loma/Cabrillo. There was plenty to do, see, and eat near the hotel (Point Loma Seafood!), and most everything we wanted to visit was a quick jaunt in the car. It's a pretty recently redeveloped area and was completely safe and nice. We had a king room with a pullout bed for our 4-year-old and a pack-and-play for the baby, and it was tight but we fit. The room was not as spacious as some courtyards we've been in, but I would stay there again. The rooms are even smaller in the older hotels. It's still a new hotel and was very clean and pleasant. I used the guest laundry and the machine I chose happened to break on us and the front desk staff took a few minutes to figure out how to handle the problem, but my money was refunded and they gave us extra soap to run another load. The hotel is very near the airport which was initially a concern because my husband is a super light sleeper, but he slept through whatever flights there were (with the windows/balcony door closed), as did both kids. Airport noise was not a problem at all. As with most other Courtyards we've stayed at, the breakfast is a complete ripoff. We got the free breakfast rate and paid $10 extra per night to feed us and the kids, which is the only way to eat breakfast there. It's basically your free continental breakfast at any other hotel, plus some dude in a chef hat flipping you an omelet. That omelet was NOT worth $12 or whatever the menu lists it for. If you're going to pay $12, go to a real breakfast joint. Overall it's a very nice hotel in a nice area and we would definitely stay at Liberty Point again.

The front desk staff acted like we were an inconvenience for them. We arrived at 3:00 PM and I said that we would wait to get a room with a nice view. A couple of weeks prior to our stay, I had talked with front desk staff and requested a room with a view of Liberty Park and/or bay. I am also a Marriott Reward Program member and have been for 30 years. On my rewards data, I have a permanent request for a high floor. Granted this hotel only has four floors. Well, it took us three rooms to get one with an acceptable view. First we were sent to a room on the second floor looking at a concrete roof and concrete wall of the next building. The next room, also second floor, all you saw when you looked out from the room was the high wall of the patio. The room was among their smallest, and it felt like you were in a dungeon. If you went out on the patio and looked over the top of the wall, you would see water. If you looked down, you saw roof. The third room was OK. We had to wait 30 minutes for it to be ready. Which was fine, and what we had said repeatedly when we first checked in. Third floor room, looked out over the roof of the portico at front of hotel, but did have a little view of distant hillside of Point Loma. We were tired by this time. Oh, the keys didn't work, so we had to go back to the front desk, again. We almost checked out on Saturday, but then decided to stay. I didn't sleep much at all the first night. The air conditioner sounded like a freight train was coming through the room, so every time it turned all, I would wake up. You would think that there would be better sound proofing in the newer hotels. People talking next door, doors banging, woke me at 1:00 AM.

Yes its close to the airport and sometimes you hear the planes, but it is not a problem at all. The hotel is not super fancy, but when you have a toddler a fancy hotel may not be the best thing, This hotel is new, clean and in a great location. Close to the zoo, Seaworld, Old Town, La Jolla, Mission Bay & the airport. The rooms are clean, nice and a good size. The pool area is very nice. The restaurant is great with a good breakfast buffet. The staff are nice and courteous. Both check in & out took 3 minutes!! The hotel is also right next to a plaza filled with restaurants & Starbucks. The restaurants might not be great, but it'll do for the first day you arrive. The hotel is also a 10min walk to another plaza with Vons, Trader Joes, and yes Starbucks! I actually have nothing negative to say!! Trust me this is a first. My tip to travelers is STAY AT THIS HOTEL. You will be surprised.

As a General Manager he should have been rolling out the red carpet, they did give us some breakfast coupons of which on Monday we could not use because the kitchen closes at 10am and we got there at 9:58... The waffle bar was already cleaned up..... I guess if I did not have to wait for the GM we would have made breakfast.... O well, not going to change my lifestyle but could change yours.... It is not the fact that I found the needles, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s was the poor and very unprofessional manner of handling it and being so lackadaisical about the safety of my family....

We stayed at the Marriott Courtyard Liberty Station and were highly impressed with the hotel. The hotel is centrally located to all of the attractions where you can get to Sea World, the zoo, downtown, etc in 15 minutes or less. We did have a rental car which made it very convenient to get around. The hotel does NOT charge for parking which is a huge plus because many hotels do in the area. Check-in was easy and they allowed us to check in early around 1pm. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a 5 minute drive from the airport so it was nice to get right to the hotel and unload after a long flight. The rooms were very nice and clean. We had two queen beds and a single sleeper which was perfect for our two boys (ages 3 and 5). Just allowed them to have their own beds at night. The bathroom was large, the TV was big and offered plenty of channels to watch. The room had a mini-fridge which was perfect to store milk, water, pop, etc. The room also had a Keurig coffee maker which was a very nice touch. Very convenient to make a cup of coffee and they offered plenty of coffee flavors. Our room did not have a balcony, but there are rooms that have them. I think because we got the room with the sleeper sofa meant there was not a balcony but we preferred the sleeper sofa option. Yes the hotel is near the airport but when you are in your room you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really notice it. They built it in such a way that it blocks out the noise very well where it didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bother us at all. Most of the flights are done by 10pm anyway. The kids loved the pool\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6was heated and also had a hot tub area as well. Lots of outdoor patio space with a fire-pit but we never used much of that. The hotel is very conveniently location near restaurants, Starbucks, grocery store, etc. There is a walking path right outside the doors that leads to a great playground for the kids. The hotel had a restaurant, caf\u00c3\u00a9, and bar as well. We never ate at the restaurant but it sure smelled good. The hotel does not offer a free breakfast so we just got items at the local grocery store and used our fridge in our room to cover the first meal of the day. There is a great pizza place nearby (Oggi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s) and Subway as well but most of the time we were out and about around San Diego. Though the hotel was a Courtyard it felt more like a big hotel with all the amenities it offered. We were very pleased with our entire stay. We really felt this was one of the best hotels we have stayed at for the money. I hope they keep up what they are currently doing with this property because I will surely stay here again in the future. I also heard the property next door (Homewood Suites) is owned by the same owner so we would also look to stay there as well. Both properties get excellent reviews so the owner and staff are doing a great job.

We didn't need a suite and didn't need or desire to cook our own meals, so Courtyard was just fine with us. There are plenty of chain type restaurants within walking distance, but the hotel restaurant was an absolute gem! We ate dinner there, but had an excellent meal. After eating overpriced, ridiculous meals for a few days, the meal in the Courtyard was a welcome surprise! The wine list, although not extravagant, was well thought, and reasonably priced. The bar was also a welcome relief. The staff was excellent, friendly, but not over the top. Well done, Courtyard! If you have extra time, you might consider driving to the Cabrillo monument.

Extra blankets and pillows came quickly, as did anything else we wanted. Breakfast was a modest brunch with an omellete waffel station. There is a bar in the center of the lobby and a heated pool with hot tub. It was cool, upper 50's and we swam in both at night. The workout room was well equipped, laundry room, and free wifi in the room. and public internet access and printer in the lobby. There is a nice takeout cafe alternative for breakfast and lunch. Just outside the hotel is a strip mall with about 7 or 8 restaurants, sushi, Italian, Mexican, etc. TCBY and Starbucks too.

The good stuff: This hotel is brand new, and the facilities are gorgeous. It smells like new carpet when you walk into the loby (we're not used to that). All rooms have a small (very small) refrigerator, huge flat panel TV, a pretty cool coffee maker, a good amount of space, and a large bathroom. The rooms on one side of the hotel are waterfront. The swimming pool is a decent size and it is heated so that you can even swim at night in San Diego without freezing in the cool air. The hot tub was very hot and big enough for six adults. There are plenty of tables outside and it was easy to find a spot by the pool. The not-so good stuff: Many of the rooms do not have a view. The first room that we were given, which we were told by the front desk was a water front room, had a tiny balcony (maybe 18 inches wide) and it overlooked a terra cotta roof on the second floor -- no water view. We called the front desk and were immediately moved to a better room, with a view, and a much larger balcony. The bigger balcony had no furniture - which I found strange. We were there for four nights and our room was only cleaned by the maid only twice. One of the two times the maid came was because we asked the front desk that day to make sure that our room was cleaned. When the maid cleaned the room, the small bottles of shampoo were not refilled. The coffee cannisters that can make one cup each in the room were not replaced after they was used. We actually ran out of toilet tissue on one of the days without maid service. The hotel ran out of towels by the pool on three occasions during our stay. At checkout, I told management about our issues and no appologies were made. I was told by the manager that she had been \"off\" for the last few days. When I told her about the coffee she told me that the hotel may be out of the in-room coffee, but that complementary coffee is available to all guests in the loby and that I should have known that from reading information left in the room. Anyway, we did like the hotel, regardless of our small problems. The location is pretty central. We were able to get to Old Town for dinner in about 10 minutes, Ocean Beach is about 15 minutes away, and La Jolla Cove was about 25 minutes away.
