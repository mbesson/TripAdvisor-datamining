I have a slight cleaning OCD (to the extent that i have a robot vacuum at home to help me) and i couldn\u2019t find a speck of dust, fingerprint. Immaculate.

For those who say that the rooms are too small, what can I say... welcome to Paris! It's part of the city. The bathroom was great! and huuuuuuuuge. I took such a long warm shower... the only thing that I would change would be the breakfast. They have two options: express or normal. The express is too \"express\" for the 13\u00e2\u201a\u00ac you have to pay. And the normal one, 26\u00e2\u201a\u00ac didn't seem amazing for such a price.

Although the room was small (Number 35) it lacked nothing. The design was great and the bathroom (again small) was modern and had a large shower. Breakfast was excellent, only downside was that it is served downstairs and so no windows, maybe in the summer months would be nice to have views. The location of the hotel is fabulous, 2 minute from the Louvre on a quiet back street. All the staff were very helpful and polite (unlike our second hotel, another review to follow for Hotel Power!). The only thing they could have done to improve our stay was to advise us not to go to the Crazy Horse show, we bought tickets through the hotel and it was awful (see review and don't go). If we return to Paris this hotel will certainly be on our list of places to stay. We looked at the other larger rooms and to be honest we were more than happy to have been in a standard room; small, excellent design, well equipped, fantastic bed and bathroom.

I recommend going downstairs for breakfast which is very cosy. Shopping rue saint honore, visiting the louvre or walk in Jardin des tuileries takes 1 min by foot from the hotel.

We were in room 42 a 'Tradition' room which is bright airy and decorated to a high standard with a good size bathroom and a great monsoon shower. 3 juliette balconies looked out onto the pictureqsue parisian street with a great view of the tuileries gardens at the end of the street. The corridors are dark but in a luxurious atmospheric way offering a dramatic contrast to the bright reception and mezzanine lounge areas (where free tea and coffee, magazines and a honesty pay bar are situated - nice touch!). Breakfast is served in the small but perfectly decorated vaults of the hotel offering a real variety with hot food cooked at your request.

Maybe this was not my best ideea. Especialy because there was no review on the website about this hotel. The price was high, but acceptable, among the other offers for a 4 star hotel. Becouse we were second rank citizens, coming from Eastern Europe, we had to pay in advance for the first night, like a kind of guarantee. In our country there is a saying: you have to pay in advance only when you go to the street woman. So, the hotel policy for Eastern Europe citizens is \"the money in advance\". I consider this an offence for me and my fellow citizens. The second mistake was the booking of a room, without knowing it's size. And we find the awful truth after paying in advance, at the reception, the first night: the room was smaller than my home bathroom. It has only 12 sq. meters, plus the bathroom, with 4 sq. meters. All the room space it's occupied by the bed. Around it two persons can not cross. And we had to live there for 4 long days and nights. We felt like in a prison. Above all, we could not see the room, before paying for it. That's scandalous. Pay attention, don't let yourself be fooled by the bar offer. We have payed for it much more than it deserves. We wanted to drink a coffee and a tea, and we where charged for an express breakfest with 26 euros! The heating in the room and bathroom didn't work the first night - in a 4 stars hotel! - and outside where 3 Celsius degrees. Another thing, that besides the other problems looks ridiculous, puzzled us: the complimentary bottle of water and chocolates where available only the first night, and the room maid did not complete each morning the toiletries we consumed - and we lived there for 4 long days and nights. I do not recomend this hotel to anyone.
