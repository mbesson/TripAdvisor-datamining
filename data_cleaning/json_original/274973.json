We had two of the three rooms on the sixth floor, and were very pleasantly surprised. One of the rooms had a double bed, the other a king, and both had very nice bathrooms with showers. And they had windows that opened - either to the front of the hotel or to the courtyard. My room was on the street side: I heard more birds than street sounds. The rooms may seem small by American standards, but I did not find them small for European hotels. They were well layed out and very clean. We booked them using the last minute internet rate on their website, and considered them a steal compared to other properties we found.

There was a laundromat close by that was very easy to use. The service was varied depending on the staff member who was there. Having said this all staff were very keen to assist us & friendly. I think the staff who was not as good did not speak English (but still able to converse in English) as well as others. One staff member, Lee, spoke fluent French & English (from east coast of Canada). He was exceptional & even called our relatives (who we had not met & spoke little English) and confirmed our visit. Also one of the lady staff members was very helpful with our taxi when leaving. She ensured that the driver knew where we going & we were well looked after. She even waved us off. The hotel was very clean & facilities very good (only issue was lift that was very small). Had a good reception breakfast & bar area. Wi fi internet was included & in addition the hotel had an I pad available to use at reception. We had 2 rooms (1 Double & one twin).

I think I've spent about 15 nights on about 5 different stays overall this year. Thought I would add some more information and observations. - the hotel is still a reliable, clean, pleasant hotel in a great location - the rooms are still clean, and a fraction larger than most hotels of this standard in this location - the staff is pleasant, one young gentleman receptionist speaks excellent English too - you CAN get a fresh (and very nice) espresso at breakfast, you just have to catch the eye of the breakfast server. On my first visits I was too shy to ask and she didn't offer. On more recent ones I've been offered and accepted with thanks In general, I rate this hotel highly and will continue to return until I get bored. Which is why I have increased my original rating from average to very good (although I would put it somewhere in between, perhaps just \"good\") BUT, take my advice. Do not let yourself be placed in room 103. It's the one opposite the reception on the ground floor, next to the lift and next to the breakfast preparation room (kitchen). For all those reasons, do not choose this room! You can hear almost everything that goes on in reception, of course, people tend to congegrate by the lift, and the people in the kitchen in the morning wake you up when they start their jobs. The room looks out onto the street, but surprisingly, there is not disturbance from this source (must have good windows). I didn't kick up a fuss because I knew the hotel was booked out due to a convention in Paris. But I won't let myself be put in that room again....

The room is small, holding only a bed and desk, but it was comfortable. The bathroom is clean. Everything had an updated feel to it. The one negative about staying in this hotel is that they did not pay attention to sound-proof the rooms. If someone is in the hallway or if the maid is cleaning, it is very loud - as if the person is in your room. It did wake us up a few times. Other than the noise when people are in the hallways, it is generally quiet (no noise from outside the windows). The hotel is well located. It is a 3 minute walk to a metro station. It is a 10 minute walk to the Arc de Triomphe. There are little food shops on the block and is close to a super market. I would recommend skipping the 12 Euro per person breakfast and getting something from the boulangerie down the street instead. The continental breakfast looked good with cereal, juice, coffee, meats, bread, and yogurt, but we got pastries, coffee, and orange juice for 10 euros total (good tip for a budget traveler).

It was fairly easy to get to on the metro line from Airport Paris - Charles de Gaulle. Just take the RER B to Chatelet des Halles stop then hop on the RER A line just two stops to Charles de Gaulle Etoile stop and within a 5 minute walk you are at the hotel! The reception desk were very friendly and some were able to speak English if you couldn't communicate in French. The location was most important for us, seeing that it is just a 5 minute walk from the Arc de Triomphe monument and Champs-Elys\u00c3\u00a9es and one of the major stops for the Hop on Hop off bus tour (Les Cars Rouges), it was ideal for site seeing. It also helped because we were able to come home and freshen up or rejuvenate our batteries before heading back out on our next adventure - it wasn't too out of the way for us to come back for a brief break if our feet were tired. If you are into walking this hotel is just that much better for you! We walked to the Eiffel Tower in about 20-25 minutes, the Louvre in about 20 minutes, and we also walked all the way to Sacr\u00c3\u00a9-Coeur & Moulin Rouge in about 40-45 minutes. If you aren't up to walking there is a metro stop/RER stop just a few minutes from the hotel which can get you to all the major attractions as well as the Hop on Hop off bus tours I mentioned above. The room was on the small side compared to North American standards, but that's the case for most hotels in Europe. Although it was small, it was still very clean and enough space for two people to fit comfortably. There was a TV with two English channels (CNN and BBC World) the rest are in French. You shouldn't be spending much time in the hotel anyway there is so much to see in Paris! You have to leave your key at the front desk when you leave for the day which some people may find annoying but I thought it was helpful not having to worry about losing or misplacing the room key. As a bonus, there is a little corner store just seconds away from the hotel (Corner Ave. Carnot) that sells bottled water, fresh fruit, among many other concessions & toiletries.... and the owner was very nice and spoke English! There are also French caf\u00c3\u00a9s all over the main streets that reach the Arc de Triophe (of course a bit pricey which is normal for Paris!) so you should definitely be able to find something to your liking.

Staff was very helpful, and was quick to answers our questions in English. Location is outstanding. Neighborhood is quiet and feels safe. The hotel is about a one block walk to the #1 Metro line (best tourist line) and 2 blocks to the CDG Etoile Metro station (which is a huge station). The Air France airport shuttle also conveniently drops you off about 2 blocks from the hotel. I'd definitely stay here again when we return to Paris.", "Date": "May 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "ireland", "Title": "\u201cNOT what it says on the tin!!!\u201d", "Author": "banSHEIreland", "ReviewID": "UR109185449", "Content": "Although this is merely a three star hotel I did have expectations that it still would be very nice (as it got a lot of good reviews).

We stayed in Room 310 - it was fairly small (although I understand that this is the norm in Paris), modern and exceptionally clean. There was a mini bar in the room, together with tea/coffee making facilities. The bathroom was spotlessly clean - it had a shower, but no bath. On the downside, the room was quite noisy (it was next to the lift) and we were woken earlier than we would have liked each morning as people moved around the hotel. I suppose this was a blessing in disguise as it meant we had more time to explore the beautiful city! We had very little contact with the staff during our stay and had our itinerary entirely planned, so there was no real opportunity for them to provide us with personal touches which turns a good service into an exceptional one. However, the receptionists were always friendly and polite as we collected our room key each night. We didn't have breakfast at the hotel - instead, we chose to eat at the amazing p\u00c3\u00a2tisserie at the end of the road.

It was a great opportunity to experience the Parisien caf\u00c3\u00a9 culture. Just a couple of minor points that stopped us from giving the hotel a score of 5 out of 5 - the noisy room, the tiny towels (and we're not big people!!) which were also a little tired (we like soft and fluffy!), the fact that the tea/coffee wasn't restocked during our visit and that we were left to re-use dirty cups each day.

The hotel has room service, breakfast, great free internet connection, and even a private bar! The room is also very quiet and we slept extremely well. The location is great for getting anywhere. On day one we walked from the hotel to the Eiffel tower then to Notre Dame via Blvd. St Germain (great for high end shops), then to the Louvre, then to the Concorde monument to the Champs elysees, and then back through the Arc de Triomphe on the way to the hotel. It took all day but we saw a lot! If you're not into walking (or need to go further afield) the Argentine metro stop is about 75 metres from the hotel entrance and connects the whole city. The room was very nicely presented - this hotel is modern and spotlessly clean. I am a 6\"5 Australian and had no troubles navigating through the small passageways etc even with my girlfriend's dozen shopping bags! (although she did find it comical!).

Thus, exceptionally convenient. 2. Quiet location -- one can have their window open and enjoy a quiet night. 3. Great ventilation, so if one does not want to open the window, that's fine too. 4. Free French or English newspapers in the morning. 5. Clean. 6. Friendly, professional staff. 7. Good mattress. 8. Advertises wi-fi, but for some reason they instead gave us an ethernet cable gratis. Hookup was easy, and connection was FAST. 9. For Paris, the nightly rate off the internet is reasonable for all of these pluses. On the con side, as others have noted, this is not the place for claustrophobics. In particular, the bathroom, while beautifully outfitted in newish, first-class fixtures, was tiny. Obese people may not fit on its toilet (not kidding...) and the shower gives little room to maneuver.

I decided to book Hotel Acacias because the rooms \"looked\" nice and the hotel was located close to Champs Elysees and the metro. The hotel is located down a small street and can easily be found. Upon my arrival, I was given my keys and directed straight to the elevator, with no instructions. The elevator barely fits you and your luggage and moves at a snail's pace. Once you step out of the elevator, you are in a small hallway where if you turn right you hit a room and if you turn left you hit another room....leaving you very little room to move around! When I got into my room, I was surprised by how small the room looked....it made me think of a matchbox! For 2 people, this room left very little to be desired and very little room to move around after your luggage is placed! The walls are paper thin, so if other guests are in the small hallway area waiting for the slow elevator, you will hear everything they are saying since they are pretty much right next to your room door! The hotel staff kept to themselves during most of our 5-day stay up until our last day! On our last day, it started pouring heavily outside that we had to run from the metro station to our hotel. As we entered the hotel completely drenched, a male hotel staff decided to berate and scold us for not leaving our hotel room key at the desk so he could tell when we were in or out of the room.....saying that the hotel room key is heavy and this is standard practice in Paris hotels. First of all, I wasn't told during my check-in that I had to leave my key at the hotel desk everytime I came and went from the hotel! Secondly, after days of holding onto our key during our day excursions, none of the other hotel staff bothered to tell us of this policy and we didn't mind lugging the heavy key around town! So, to tell us on our last day when we are soaked after running through the rain, this was obviously not the appropriate time to be telling us of this key policy.

For starters, the room was extremely small. Yes, hotel rooms in Paris are small, but this was ridiculous. Nowhere to put a suitcase except on the desk or bed, and barely any room to walk around the bed. And the shower was so small that I could barely fit inside and close the door. One of the biggest issues we had was the noise from the hotel. The elevator leads to a small atrium which all the rooms are next to. The noise from the elevator going up and down and room doors shutting was very loud and disturbing. Now, there were definitely some good things. The location was excellent, especially to the metro and the buses to CDG and Orly. In addition, there were several bakeries and small markets around the hotel that were great spots to pick up food.

The staff is supperb. They have a solution for each problem you may present: from changing the room because my wife is almost paranoid about lifts (they moved us from the room 410 to 116 and all we had to do was left our luggage prepared - they did everything), to finding a box and bubble plastic to pack a bottle of champagne I received as a gift from some friends (believe me. It is REALLY hard to find this things in Paris). If you need any help call for the two angels at the reception: Carla and Priscilla . Sure they will be glad to help you in french, english and portuguese. The rooms are cosy - see some pictures of room 116 (do not expect to have large rooms in Paris except for some 5 stars hotels) and very clean. The towels and the toillet stuff (shampoo, etc) are changed everyday. The air conditioned works properly, the matrimonial bed was ok and the sheets were changed everyday. Ok... ok... the lifts are tiny but which one isn't in Paris? No problem staying in a room at the front part. The Acacias street is very quiet even if you prefer to open the window instead turning on the air conditioned (I mean during summer time. During winter let's say it would not be a good idea to open the windows).

The rooms were very small but very clean and the shower was excellent. I would definitely recommend a stay here.

The hotel has free internet access in the lobby and also in the rooms (the rooms dont have WiFi but you can connect via LAN cable). Rooms are somewhat small but they are very clean and comfortable. The truth is that room size is not really an issue unless you plan to stay most of the time in your room. Location is great, only a short walk from the Line 1 Metro.

The check in process was easy. The front desk staff were extremely friendly and immediately welcomed us with a cup of coffee in their small lounge. Our room overlooked the street and it was great to open the window and have Paris come in! The room was small yet extremely quaint. There was plenty of room to move around even with our 2 large duffle type suitcases. The bed was comfortable and extremely firm. Just the way i like it. Linens were clean. The TV and AC worked perfectly. The bathrooms were clean and finished with beautiful marble or maybe travertine tiles...not sure which one. The shower had great water pressure and the toilet was neat and clean. The hotel is situated 5 mins from the Champs D'elysee...did i spell that right? The restaurant across the street was excellent. The staff were extremely friendly. Gave us a guide on Paris to use if we promised to bring it back the next day. We even got to meet the chef. We liked the hotel and area so much that we came back to Paris after touring Europe and stayed at the hotel for 2 more nights... Thanks for a great little hotel and a friendly and helpful staff.
