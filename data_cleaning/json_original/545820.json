{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Pretty little resort, not much to offer. Planned to stay here for 6 days but ended up making it just over 2. It's a pretty resort, certainly, and the pool is nice to look at, but always crowded because there is nothing else to do. There are great ocean views in every direction. Nevertheless, I'm not a diver (and yeah you have to pay quite a bit for every dive), and the beach next to the resort is manmade and not exactly made to lounge upon. Garpu Restaurant is okay but after a couple of days you'll be bored with it, most likely. Prices are not low. The Spa was also lovely, but again not cheap. Every activity they offered was pricy, there is nothing to do nearby, and the trip to pretty much anywhere else is going to take at least an hour and a half, if not more. You need Internet access? You'll have to trudge to their Boutique and pay about $5/hr; never mind that the woman looking over the place didn't know the password and we had to come back a couple of different times. When we left they tried to charge us 100% of the 6-day stay even though a) we were leaving because we were dissatisfied and b) their policy clearly stated otherwise.", "Date": "Jan 6, 2009", "ReviewID": "UR381247104", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "DrouNY"}, {"Content": "Value for Money       Poolside 2", "Date": "Nov 24, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR925341238", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Beach_holidayer"}, {"Content": "Loved the experience We enjoyed staying at Rama Candidasa in Bali, Indonesia. It is a nice place for one to enjoy the nature away from daily hustle-bustle. There is a small village nearby that caters to everyday needs. Vegetarians might face a challenge as there are just one or two items on the whole menu. Else it is a nice place. The services given by the staff are spectacular. The sea is beautiful giving ample opportunities for coral reef diving. The best time to visit is April-July. Weather is absolutely wonderful.", "Date": "Nov 10, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR647703314", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "PingiGgn"}, {"Content": "Not worth it We decided to go to Candi Dasa at the end of our stay to just relax. We were picked up at another hotel in Seminyak by the hotel but we had to pay 350,000 rupiah (about $US 40). The travel time by car was about 1 to 1.5 hours.When we arrived at the 'hotel' we were told that they had overbooked us and were transferring us to another hotel. After speaking to the manager, we were able to get a room at the hotel. It was in an older wing and four stories up. They don't have an elevator and luckily they had the bell boy carry all of our bags up. Poor guy was probably only 120 pounds!The room was very traditional -- not a lot of modern ammenities and lights are very dim. No room service.Since there's not much to do in Candi Dasa, the hotel takes advantage of this -- spas were very expensive, and they charge for everything (internet, water, etc.). The wi-fi wasn't working and they didn't know how to trouble shoot it. Restaurant is okay and had to eat there since the only other restaurants are in other hotels. Food is edible but not great. Staff is nice but it seemed that there are not a lot of them. Whenever we needed anything it seemed that they were all busy .. all two of them!Pictures just make the place look better than it is. I didn't take any pics because I didn't want to waste my time.We left the next day but the front desk tried to overcharge us for it. Again we had to call the manager to sort it out.Don't recommend it at all.", "Date": "Oct 5, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR479860000", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "Author": "MaericaDizon"}, {"Content": "Federico and Fam It is very nice resort, friendly staff.

Asked at reception if larger rooms were available we would be happy pay further to upgrade - the response was with out checking NO. My eldest son 17yr  I walked some distance towards Candi Dasa, there are no shops (to purchase general groceries) or suitable restaurants  some other hotel facilities observed have closed - rotting going back to jungle. Later the same evening we again approached reception (again completely unhelpful) being advised we had booked standard rooms  all rooms are the same - as stated we have travelled to Bali 10 times this is the first time to complain, luckily through our booking we had the facility to call  request a change of location, we were gone the next day by 02:00pm being relocated to Puri Raja Legain, being advised we were moving from superior accom to moderate - on arrival we were pleasantly surprised with both the hotel  facilities far exceeding those available at Rama Candi Dasa.Our family warning to all who consider Candi Dasa or this hotel is read all previous comments logged on this site  believe - we were lucky to have dodged this bullet  land on our feet.", "Date": "Jan 2, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR181047662", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "LesterJ"}, {"Content": "ok, but wouldnt go again I am at ravel agent and stayed here for one night on an educational trip to Bali. The resort is ok, well kept public areas, gardens and nice pool. The restaurant is relatively new and very nice. The spa is excellent. However the rooms were only average and the bathrooms need alot of work, the shower only operated in scalding hot. Our room was on the 1st floor and at the end of a hallway, and our view from the front door was overlooking someones house with pigs in the backyard, which meant it did smell quite a bit. Also there is a rooster somewhere nearby that likes to wake you up very early. I would pay the extra money to have a better room. If all you want is to do nothing for a couple days then this resort would be ok, however it is 2hours out of Kuta and isnt good enough for me to go there again.", "Date": "Nov 27, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR211577575", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "chica_brandybuck"}, {"Content": "reasonable Stayed here for one night and found our room to be perfectly adequate for our needs. Had previously stayed at Ubud and the bathroom at this hotel was a vast improvement. The meal we had was good but nothing special. Pool area was clean and the gardens were lovely.

Outside bathroom which was foul, hot water a bit dodgy and toilet didn't really work, very noisy due to dogs and people traffic behind our villa. Oh no lock on the bathroom door which meant anyone could climb over the outside wall break thru the flyscreen and into your room??Restuarant quite nice had a couple of nice meals, breakfast nothing much to write home about, some things not covered and providing breakfast for fly's and bugs.Aircon worked well which was a bonus as our cottage was towards the back and quite a heat trap.Sorry to say but will never stay there again, just didn't feel comfortable the whole time we were there.", "Date": "Sep 1, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR584961316", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "AustraliaIggy"}, {"Content": "My hangout in Candidasa       de lobby", "Date": "Mar 31, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR338195841", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "beachyogi"}, {"Content": "Good Bang for your Buck       restauraunt", "Date": "Nov 29, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR455776163", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Shine13"}, {"Content": "Pretty Place Sucky Service       Our bed.

I later found out from other tourists that there is indeed a bus run by Peramas that will get you to Kuta for only 35,000 rupiahs. 2. one night I got a ride back from the center of town and left the driver to the restrooms in the lobby area as I returned to my room. five minutes later, he was knocking at my door asking me to come out and talk. the only way he could have found me was through the front desk. and as a lone woman traveller, I didn't particularly appreciate this oversight in security for their hotel guests.other reasons not to stay at the Rama Candidasa: 1. it's a 20 minute walk into the center of town along a really dark and pedestrian unfriendly stretch of road. 2. contrary to what is implied by a lot of websites, there is no beach at the Rama Candidasa! the waves actually break off the concrete foundation of the resort. there is a small patch of sand just off the resort grounds, but there are usually fishing boats docked on it.", "Date": "May 23, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR931449925", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "wouaw...       la chambre", "Date": "Jul 30, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR978509441", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "noemie1702"}, {"Content": "recommand\u8305 par les TO ... mais \u813f EVITER !!!       circulation parfois \u8305tonnante ...", "Date": "Feb 4, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR245801793", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "1"}, "Author": "lamourestharmonie"}, {"Content": "Entspanung pur   showReview(10026026, 'full');", "Date": "Oct 1, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR897726482", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "MikeP_7"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g608484-d545820-r23323824-Rama_Candidasa_Resort_and_Spa-Karangasem_Bali.html", "HotelID": "545820", "Price": "$85"}}
