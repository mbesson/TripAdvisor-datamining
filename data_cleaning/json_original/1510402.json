When we asked why it didn't have a door the Hotel Attendant barked that 'doors are reserved for people who pay more,' we actually paid full price for our room. Also situated on the 2nd floor, our room was dirty and the smell of raw sewage steeped up through the shower drain and permeated our tiny box like room. Not to mention, this 2nd floor room faced the busy loud street of Atocha with none stop traffic and drunk people screaming throughout the night. I am sure that the cosmopolitan city of Madrid has much better accommodations in the same price range. I feel that this hotel chain spent too much money promoting itself as a cool destination for young travelers and skimped on important things like cleanliness, doors on washrooms and friendly staff. Perhaps if I would have known it is a one star ( 1 out of 4 stars), I would have thought twice before making my reservation. Cheap & Basic is a glorified Hostel. Well a Hostel without the glory.

Very central, easy access to the metro, restaurants and clubs and most importantly, very easy to get to from the airport. Jump on the 24hr autobus from the airport (only 2 euros) and Atocha is the very last stop. The hotel is less than a ten minute walk from the bus station. The hotel is close to everything you'd need. If you fancy walking around to see the sights... its totally possible. We preferred to jump on the Madrid City Tour double bus (available from five mins away from the hotel door) which helped us to take in as much of the city as possible in the short two days we were there. Highlights include Mercado San Miguel (heavenly food market), Plaza Mayor, Puerta Del Sol and Chueca. Secondly, the hotel itself. Very clean, modern and minimalist. Lots of white, lots of art and I nice special touches like the exposed brick wall, fashion books and magazines in reception and the humorous messages on the room key cards. The 'help yourself' area where tea, coffee, biscuits and fruit were freely available any time of day or night. The cosy roof top terrace with amazing views of the city. The hotel staff were absolutely GREAT. Warm, welcoming and extremely helpful. Receptionist Maria in particular was awesome. Giving us tips on which bars and restaurants to go to depending on what sort of music/crowd we liked, and going as far as drawing directions on a map so that we could find them. Another lovely surprise was the bottle of bubbly and chocolates they gave me as a birthday present - nice touch! The only downside was the few insects we came across in the room on our last night.

Small intimate lobby Good location . Walking distance to station, museums, metro stop and not too far from Barrio de Las Letras and Mercado San Miguel (great tapas there). Our room was all white and very spartan which is great at packing time, you can immediately notice if you are leaving something behind. We had balcony to the busy street, but the noise was muffled. I also liked very much the cappuccino machine in the lobby. It makes a fresh ground cup of coffee in no time. What i did not like. Size; even though I requested the L room (Large) It was small. Lack of bathroom privacy.The shower door can also be used as a bathroom door, which may give you some privacy, but not much. Maintenance. The shower threshold trim was rotten and looked moldy. Kind of yucky especially in all white room (mentioned to the maid how terrible that looked and next day it was removed). Price/Value. In my opinion 99 Eu. (on promotion) was too much for this room. I would recommend this hotel, but at a lower price. The photos on line look great. What sold me was the terrace photo. But in the end this spot was very hot and we did not use it. I am not even sure if it belongs to the room next to it or it is open to all guests..", "Date": "October 29, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Saskatoon, Canada", "Title": "\u201cThe best hotel of our trip!\u201d", "Author": "prairiegirl1527", "ReviewID": "UR82635572", "Content": "We arrived in Madrid in the early morning and due to our poor map reading abilities, got lost during the extremely short distance from the train station to the hotel.

However stairs seem to be the norm in the Madrid metro rather than escalators, so yes it is always best to pack light. The lounge on the ground floor was a real help - coffee or tea anytime, free internet workstations, the Herald Tribune etc. I noticed some people brought their breakfast bags to the lounge in the morning to augment with hot drinks. The breakfast bags included a piece of fruit, a croissant and a bottle of very good juice. No tea kettle in the room, but we took thermoses downstairs to get hot water from the lounge in order to have tea in the room. The staff had excellent English. Not a lot of coat hangers or storage space in the room, but we had only a 3 night stay. The free wifi went completely down on our last evening, and the internet generally went down for half an hour or so. I feel the staff did their best to try to fix it, but as the technician did not seem to want to return to the hotel, it was not resolved that evening. The toilet and shower are separate, and the sink is kind of in a corner of the room. I believe our room was 61, and it was very quiet - which was a major prior concern for me.
