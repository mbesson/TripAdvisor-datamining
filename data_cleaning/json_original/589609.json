Other reviewers have stated that the location is excellent, and it is. What that means is the hotel is right on the Branson Landing which is an outdoor mall of sorts, but also has a great assortment of upscale restaurants and nightlife as well. Waxy O'Shea's (Irish Pub) is right across the walkway and has live music many nights, as well as other type venues. However, if you are going to music shows on the strip, then many will be 15-25 minutes away due to traffic (not distance). The room we stayed in was very clean, staff was friendly as most are in Branson, and would stay here again. The room rate is higher than what you can stay on the strip (which is the only reason why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5), but you do pay for the convenience of being to walk right out of your hotel into the landing. This hotel is more for those who want to be in the middle of the action and a more urban feel. If you are looking for the mom and pop type that Branson has lots of, then this would not be it. Parking is $8 but I would advise to skip that and park for free by Belk store. You can drop you luggage while you check in, then park for free by Belk and walk down the landing back to your hotel; no big deal at all.", "Date": "September 6, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Raytown", "Title": "\u201cgreat hotel! great time!\u201d", "Author": "Leslie S", "ReviewID": "UR139407431", "Content": "It will be hard to stay anywhere else when my husband and I visit Branson in the future.

I had made a prior reservation through Travelocity and since the rooms were so pricey decided to book the non refundable price which I will never do again. We ended up having to change the reservation to a week ahead. Non refundable means just that and they mean it. So will never do that again. I paid for two nights and got one. Hotel offered no help just my bad luck. I understand that. Kudos best service was the parking valets. Great job Joe and the guys!! Now the good: Room was nice but not as nice as the original room I had booked which had the fountain view. Due to my need to change the reservation I had to book a cheaper room. This was a double queen without the fountain view I had wanted. Still nice room has a fridge and microwave and balcony. We could hear the band when we got back to our room until late maybe 10-11 but we were ok with that. Restaurants were close and so were the shops. Piano bar was great. Bad: We had no idea we were in the other building and I had read to valet park which we did as parking yourself is $8 and valet is $12. Had to lug our stuff over to the next building and 4th floor as no one offered to help us. When we came back in for the evening the smoke alarm went off. I called the front desk and no one answered. My husband had to deal with it. Also know that internet service is $9.95 extra and we never could get the tv to work. Pool had to be in the other building as we never saw it or looked. Too much hauling of things back and fourth. Now the trolley never came as scheduled. We walked to everything. Drinks and beer are pricey so be prepared. Bottled beer $4 in most places. Piano bar $10 to get in but if you leave you cannot get back in even though they said they had a stamp we needed to leave but guess what they had no stamp. So we just left. But the place and music were great. Due to all the walking I felt worn out and exhausted and did not enjoy the stay. Shower next morning was a joke. Shower pressure very limited. Pretty shower but that is it. I truly will not stay someplace again that is where you cannot get to your car and room easily. We have stayed in Miami and Tampa and had much nicer rooms for this price. No reasonable place for breakfast next am so it was either eat in the hotel pricey restaurant or go ahead and check out as we would have had to pay $8-12 to park when we came back for about 3 hours left in the room. So some things are limited and pricey. Now worst part since I paid for the room ahead of time I was shocked to see the $50 hold charge on my debit card. I have been though this before but forgot about it. They hold $50 until you check out but your bank can and does hold it for days. Be prepared on this one. Over all would probably not go back even though the room was nice. Just felt trapped and limited on coming and going as I pleased. For $207 which is what I paid for the first room which would have been about $250 you would think the internet would be free and service much better!", "Date": "September 3, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tulsa, Oklahoma", "Title": "\u201cno sleep\u201d", "Author": "jcook197", "ReviewID": "UR138612823", "Content": "Had a room that faced the street.

While the location is great on the Landing with the restaurants and shopping right there, many of the basic extras require an additional fee and the room rates are not cheap compared to other hotels in the Branson area. Granted you are basically paying for the location, but the additional fee for Internet use in your room (unless you are at one of the upper levels of the Hilton Honors), the high priced breakfast (which is usually free at most hotels we stay at) plus the cost to park your car. Branson is not a big city so having to incur these extra costs that are normally provided at no charge even in most big city hotels, was somewhat disappointing. We did enjoy our visit to Branson and found this hotel to be nicely decorated. We did have a small issue when we arrived. The front desk staff wrote the wrong room number on our room key holder and so we could not get into the room we thought that was ours. Finally, with all of our bags in tow since we received no help from the bellhops downstairs, a staff member happened to be walking by and we told him our issue and showed him the number written on our card holder. He called the front desk after using his key to open the door which was already occupied by another family. When we got into our room, we found it be of decent size for a family of four. The bathroom was big and was very appealing with both a tub and separate glass shower. We had a small fridge in the room which came in handy as well. We did not have a fountain view (which we probably could not afford with all of the extra charges anyway), but we did enjoy our stay. We also used the pool which stayed open until11:00p.m. which was convenient after returning from an evening show. Overall we found most of the staff to be friendly but could tell that some others were not as welcoming as would be expected from vacationers. The bored look on their face when you walked by or their body language often showed that a few of the staff seemed unhappy or were having a bad day, but it was noticeable at times. Others smiled and acted happy whether they were or not but that goes a long way with pleasing a traveler.

However, the rooms are large and spacious with a very lovely bathroom (ours included a shower and a bathtub which was very pleasant). The only drawback was that our AC/Heater unit would not shut off and when the heater kicked on, the dust within the exhaust seemed to start burning causing that first-time-heater smell throughout the room. We had the engineer come up just in case due to safety concerns but he assured us that's all it was. The employees were very nice as well as the Brookside restaurant downstairs. You can valet your car or self park in the garage directly next door. Unfortunately you must walk very briefly outside to get to the garage (just a few yards) so if it rains, you will get a tad wet. The music can be quite loud during the day and early evening that is played on the Landing. It's no obscene, though, when you're in the room so it wasn't a concern to us. The beds were mostly cozy except mine was a bit soft giving me a few sore muscles in the mornings (however, I'm a pretty big guy so I didn't expect anything different). One plus is that there's plenty of electrical outlets throughout the room to charge phones/computers/whatever.

Every visit has been good. This stay would have been 5 stars, except for some issues they could have avoided with a little bit of pro-activity. More on that in a minute. In case you aren't aware, this hotel has both regular rooms and condo/suite rooms. If you get the chance, upgrade to the condo rooms. These are equivalent to a full-sized 1 bedroom condo, with full kitchen, 2 flat panel TVs, nice balcony, and a large bathroom with separate shower and jacuzzi tub. On this particular visit, my wife and I were in Branson for a getaway, and to get started on our Christmas shopping. I booked a \"bed & breakfast\" rate, and they upgraded us to the condo (I'm also a HHonors \"vip\"). Great start! As I said, most of our stay was great. But there were a couple of things that caused me to think that management of the property has gotten a bit lax: First, when we arrived, there was a room service tray outside the room from the previous occupants' breakfast. This was at 3:30 p.m. Yuck. Unfortunately, this turned out to be an omen. Second, when we settled in for the night, we had an issue with the clock radio. It seemed \"off\" on its ability to keep time. When we tried to determine what time it really was, there weren't 2 clocks in the room that said the same time. The microwave said 3 a.m., the oven said the normal time (though a few minutes fast), and the bedside alarm clock was set to daylight savings time, and was broken/could not be reset, nor could an alarm be set. Instead, we set up a wake-up call, and it didn't work. We overslept and missed our included breakfast. My request for pro-activity: when DST ends, reset the clocks in the room and make sure they work. Third, after the alarm-clock fiasco, I went to make coffee in the fantastic kitchen (since we missed breakfast). It wasn't until the coffee should have been finished that I realized it wasn't working. There was water all over the counter, and we had no coffee. And we had no breakfast. I am happy to say that the Hilton MADE RIGHT our issues with the clocks & missed breakfast by honoring our voucher through room service, and by crediting our bill with $50. It was a nice gesture. They also brought us a new coffee maker, which worked, mostly, the second day. Fourth, our room service tray from day-one breakfast sat in the hall, literally, ALL DAY and ALL NIGHT. The next morning, our second morning, I found that another annoyed guest had put the tray immediately in front of our room. This tray was 24 hours old. I called housekeeping to complain, and they picked it up. This is my second request for pro-activity: when someone orders room service, a staff member needs to have the assignment of picking up the remnants of same. The hotel is upscale and lovely. The front desk staff and bellmen are wonderful. Our room was clean. The location is fantastic. If you are taking a shopping trip to Branson, this is a great place to stay.

You should also know that my husband tried repeatedly to contact the manager on staff regarding our missing items. No one EVER made an attempt to return his calls. Because of this, we were never given the opportunity to make a formal complaint and list the missing items or to even alert Hilton\u2019s insurance company for compensation. I called Mr. Bill Derbins, the General Manager, to discuss my situation. Mr. Derbins was NOT willing to listen to my problem. He QUICKLY took my name and phone number and told me that the woman in charge of insurance would promptly call me back. That was over a month ago, and I still have NOT heard from them. If you do choose to stay here, lock up any medications or other personal items of value in the safe or keep them with you while you are out of the room.

It sits above an outdoor mall and overlooks the lake. I believe the mall is a Simon property, just like the mall I have at home down the street, so I wasn't surprised to see all of the same chain stores, with a few small dessert-type places thrown in. The restaurants are chains as well, but we were only there for 1 night and with 2 small children it's easiest to find someplace quick and familiar. On the way to dinner my boys found RideMakerz, which is a build-your-own remote control car store. Only a few in the country, and we had a blast making a car for each child. The bellhops were plentiful and helped direct us to our room after we self-parked for $8. The garage is adjacent to the building, and there is a brief exposed walk to the hotel door. Kind of a bummer since it was raining all weekend. The hotel is new and in fantastic shape. Our rooms were clean and well appointed. After dinner, we headed to the hotel pool, like many other families. This was a Friday night, and there were about 10 kids at the pool. It was small, and had a separated hot tub, but all of the kids quickly learned to play together and everyone had a great time. It was a nice relaxing evening. Our breakfast in the morning was comped because of my Hilton status, and served in the lobby restaurant. The quality wasn't as high as I was expecting, but it was free and everyone went away full.

You can also easily take the alternate Red and Blue Routes to get to theatres on the strip from thehotel. The hotel itself is up to Hilton standards and feels new. A nice fitness room and indoor pool with a hot tub. Comfortable mattresses, spacious rooms and flat screen TV's. I travelled with my 84 year old father and we had a handicapped room. The walk in shower was great for him, but there were no chairs in the room that he he could easily sit and get up from. One chair was on wheels and the other was an armchair where you sank low into the seat. My only criticism was the staff seemed \"fake friendly.\" I don't really need to be asked \"Hello - how are you doing?\" every time I passed the front desk.\" Parking was right next door and was $8 per day.

There are two Hiltons in Branson Landing, and ours was closest to the water. Across the street lies the Hilton attached to the new Convention Center, and travelers should make sure they know which one they're checking into before arriving. Great things about this hotel: check-in was quick and easy, valet parking is convenient and a parking lot beside the hotel easy to access with a room key, and it's well-suited for the business traveler. My room was updated with flat-screen televisions, spacious marble baths, a large desk space with quickly found desk plugs for computers and cell phones. The hotel includes a casual restaurant, and sits adjacent to a courtyard with a lively Irish pub adjacent to it. My room overlooked the courtyard, and there was no noise problem. Outdoor patio diners were very casual and inside, live music can be found most nights. Across the street, in the Hilton Convention Center hotel, is Level 2 Steakhouse, one of the most exceptioonal steakhouse experiences I've had in a while. The attention to detail, right down to your choice of over 20 steak knives, was superb, along with the service. Try the Kansas City Strip and don't miss the butter cake for dessert. It's well worth the splurge. A wealth of shops exists at the landing within walking distance, and a quick trek across the street will get you into historic Branson, where we loved the old timey cafes for breakfast, the five and dime novelties and local town shops that are fun to explore for the afternoon. Away from the theatre district and therefore away from the traffic, you're at your favorite shows within a convenient 15-20 minutes. The upscale accommodations are located close enough to the action without being a part of the daily entertainment venues, providing a true escape in the beauty of the Ozarks. Fly directly into Branson at their new airport, with direct service on Air Tran via Atlanta. The hotel is only 15 minutes away, giving you a beautiful drive along the way. We were also very close to several great golf courses, including Branson Creek and Murder Rock near the airport, and the famed Payne Stewart and Ledgestone. Payne Stewart is connected to the Hilton and stay and play packages are available.

A duck tour and historic downtown Branson are both in walking distance. Only negatives - we lost a/c for a while one night.

They only brought half the order the first day and no one answered the phone the second day---you had to live a message on the recorder which they never returned. Had to call back before we go someone. Also, valet parking is nice only if someone answers the phone. After letting it ring for about 30x's, I called back to the operator to get my car brought down.

This Hilton is located, literally, on the Landing and offers smoking rooms. It was just as wonderful as we thought it would be. The location cannot be beat! You can look out your hotel window and see the shops and the water/fire fountains and the people walking below. You can walk out the side door of your hotel and you are immediately standing in front of the fire/water fountains on the landing. If you aren't familiar with the landing, this means you are in the middle of the shopping and eating walking area by the water ~ we ate at Joe's Crab Shack (to your left) and purchased a new suitcase at Totes (to your left) and the next day purchased some items at Kirkland's (on your right) and saw Bass Pro (on your right) and basically... we walked, ate, shopped, etc... all within three minutes of our hotel, max.

There are one or two restaurants on the main floor but we didn't use them. The pool and fitness center is also on the main floor ~ though I wasn't happy with the fact that everyone walking-in from parking can see directly into the pool area ~ no privacy whatsoever. Our room was spectacular - huge, jettted tub, separate enclosed glass/rain shower, very spacious room and very spacious bathroom, clean, modern bed linens and curtains. We could open the curtains and see the fountain from our room or close them and it would be completely black. We were in a very busy area with a pub below us and couldn't hear a peep ~ it was very quiet in our room. Nice. We plan to stay here everytime we visit Branson ~ which is about twice a year.

We had a queen double room with a balcony. The entry is roomy, as is the bathroom. I would say this bathroom is two to three times larger than a standard room, and the vanity is in the same room with the shower and toilet. The room itself seemed a bit crowed for four people, but something has to give since the additional space can be found in the entry and bathroom. There is a nice LCD Television and desk with a mini fridge and microwave. Our room had a sink but I don't know if it is standard. We were on the fourth floor of the south building. Our view of the mall was good but not worth paying for an upgrade to get. The air conditioner was, by my wife's standard, louder than it needed to be. I loved the hum of the unit because it drowned out other noises. There is a very nice exercise room with an indoor pool.

It is $12 for valet, or $8 to Self Park. They charge for phone calls. We would stay here again. But we wouldn't necessarily have loyalty to it.

The rooms are plush and spacious with all of the latest amenities including flat screen TV's, large marble bathrooms with seperate shower and tub, and great rooms with view. The beds were heavenly and very comfortable. This hotel sold me on the Hilton brand of hotels. The staff was wonderful and tried very hard to get to know you by name. The resturant on site was a little spendy but the food was wonderful. The common areas were open and beautiful. The maid service was prompt in the mornings. My only compliants about the hotel was that it was loud in the evenings due to some of the bars and street performers right outside of the hotel and the price of the food. Also it was hard to reach the concierge for assistance in booking attractions. Overall our stay here was most enjoyable and I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to this area as a gem of a hotel.

From the minute we arrived, the service was fantastic. The poor guy that unloaded my luggage and carted it up to the room was so friendly (my mom and I do NOT travel lite) and he put everything away and showed us where everything was and made sure we were happy before he left. The room was wonderful and very clean. The beds were comfortable and they give you plenty of pillows. I like that! We had room service several times and it was really good. They brought it very fast too. The employees were ALL very nice. We used the valet service and it was great as well. Everytime I needed my car, it was waiting when we got down to the lobby.

As we pulled up to Valet (after having read the previous reviews about parking on the landing, we knew to skip straight to valet) the Valet met us at the car with sincere warm congratulations then walked us to the front desk where they greeted us by name unexpectedly. Like others here we too received a free upgrade to a condo. Bonus for us the condo was directly across from the gorgeous Christmas tree in the Square. Prior to our Arrival the Hilton had called my parents to tell us of the 59th annual \"Adoration\" Christmas parade. They let us know what time it started and let us know exactly where to watch it from when we got there. The first night of our stay we were surprised with a tray of chocolate covered strawberries and oranges and two bottles of sparkling wine, along with congratulations from the staff. Our entire stay was full of amazing service, a warm attentive staff and a romance that made our honeymoon perfect. Warm terry cloth bath robes, a large jacuzzi, and bedding that is out of this world makes for a sweet honeymoon atmosphere as well! The only thing that could have made our stay better was a cheaper alternative to the parking situation. On the other hand then we wouldn't have met the wonderful valet guys, who also remembered us by name every time, and had lots of helpful hints on things from shows to the best place to freeze our butts off fishing!

It was nice to be able to walk down to the restaurants and stores, and the shows were only a short drive away. We were quite impressed with the hourly fountain shows, although I think they need to include a variety of music rather than the same ones over and over. The staff at the hotel was quite accommodating. We booked a room rate that included breakfast in the hotel restaurant, The Liberty Tavern, and if you are breakfast eaters this is definitely the way to go. If you like Mexican food, be sure to eat at Cantina Laredo which is located at the Landing. They make guacamole at your table and it is delicious. We also enjoyed Piztro also located at the Landing. As far as shows, we saw Paul Revere & the Raiders with Bill Medley and it was excellent.
