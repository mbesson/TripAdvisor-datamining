{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Calm and clean We stayed here 3 nights ( 2 visits) as part of a package tour around China.Definitely one of the better hotels we used. Very friendly and helpful and catering for several tour groups. All the standard stuff available, convenient to leave bags for a week d uring a trek on the Great Wall. About 20 mins walk to Pearl/Jade market and the Heavenly Temple Garden.Worth the walk. Taxi to airport easy about 45 mins and \u62e210.All very easy and user .friendly", "Date": "Oct 6, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR910297393", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "Phuqnose"}, {"Content": "Good hotel in a good location The hotel is located near the Temple of Heaven and close to several restaurants. The room was of a good size, clean and tidy with a working bathroom. The breakfast was Chinese food. But included fruit and was of a reasonable standard. Overall one of the better holidays we stayed in during our 2 and 1/2 weeks in China. By the way, as with most Chinese hotels - no porters!", "Date": "Aug 9, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR943763179", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Shauny_A"}, {"Content": "decent property, good value This unrated hotel would merit 3 stars (on a China scale). Near the Temple of Heaven, but not anything else, including public transportation. Tour groups stay here (probably because it has parking). The front desk will discount the rack rate for walk-ups.
