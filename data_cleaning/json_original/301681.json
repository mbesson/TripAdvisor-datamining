I think that they should take more care with guests arriving tired and jet lagged in the early hours of the morning. The problem as I discovered was payment for breakfast which when it arrived the next morning in our room I had to pay for on the spot rather than be able to charge it to a room bill as I had not given a credit card when I arrived. This was annoying when you are wrapped up in a towel and your wife is lying in bed wondering was is going on while your breakfast is going cold. Apart from that the hotel is fine given that it is a airport hotel, rooms are large and comfortable and even with a front facing room I did not hear any street noise.

Also they don't use a top sheet on the bed which is kind of gross considering that the bedspread touches everyone that crawls into it...ewwww!!! I will definitely take the couch over that any day. Overall the rooms are clean but they do have nightclub/bar area that has live bands and they also have another bar that you can hear the music VERY CLEARLY through the floors and the windows. My room faces the pool, which is unavailable since it's being fixed or remodeled at the moment. Definitely ask for a room that farther up than the 1 or 2 floors so you avoid the music. Roomservice breakfast is a bit expensive and OMG they bring you a TON of food, it's crazy.

Considering I only had a day, my search was narrowed to DXB (T3) vicinity, and Millennium Airport Hotel seemed like a way to go. Finding hotel was easy, given it has own booth down the arrivals hall in Dubai Intl, T3. From there, a complimentary hotel transfer is available, and I waited less than 10 mins before the bus arrived. Once on, it took us ~ 5 minutes to reach hotel. Checking in was fast and easy, and staff at the reception desk was quite competent. Overall, the service is alright, albeit not really caring nor attentive. I haven't seen any doormen and/or porters to move my luggage - things expected from a true 4 star hotel. The room, on the other hand, has pleasantly surprised me with sheer space and middle eastern motifs in d\u00e9cor. Everything, from ample storage room to scarlet carpeting and king size bed oozed luxury - though not matched by the quality of furniture. I did like the large, floor-to-ceiling window and the desk. A corner sofa with round coffee table were well placed. The in-room Internet is priced from 8 USD / 30 mins, and lobby DOES NOT have free Wi-Fi. I cannot really blame the hotel though, since in Dubai, even Starbucks doesn't offer any. I also hope that hotel management would also consider including a pair of slippers and a comb - even the cheapest onces - into their deluxe rooms. They cost next to nothing, but add a lot of functionality to an otherwise very good hotel.

We arrived at 11:00 a.m. and expected to leave our luggage and return 4 hours later.

I would rate the room 5 stars without hesitation. Since the hotel rennovation is continuing (swimming pool and areas around it are completely torn up), it does reflect in the rating Since this is an \"airport\" hotel, it does not seem fair to rate it on being able to hear planes taking off.

In the morning I was supposed to fly to London, I was provided a Millenium hotel shuttle bus to go to the airport. Although the trip to the airport from the hotel is quite short - the driver took almost 40 minutes to drive me to my Terminal. During the trip he asked me a number of inappropriate in any circumstances questions. Although I made it clear that I was not at all comfortable with that type of conversation, he continued harassing me with questions of a sexual nature also making comments about the way I looked and things I \"should be doing with my body\". As if this experience wasn't horrific enough (and believe me- being alone on a bus with such a person- I wasn't sure I was going to make my flight), the driver started asking me what I was prepared to give him for his kind guide services (he was driving me around the airport for half an hour). I told him I had nothing to give and asked again politely to be let out at the airport. He stopped the bus, got off his seat and started closing the curtains in the bus - then asking me to join him at the back of the bus so that he \"could give me a hug\". At that point I demanded to be let out of the bus - which thankfully he did and I ran for the hills.

My husband slipped on a wet floor with no warning signs when at the Dubai airport and fractured his hip. Emirates airlines was kind enough to set us up at this place for one night, with meal vouchers. When I went down to get dinner with the vouchers I explained the situation (how we had just been an entire day at the ER etc.) and was denied taking two plates of food upstairs. The person implied that since it was a buffett, I'd be taking advantage and sort of stealing food. The result? Room service, which was absolutely not worth it's cost. Additionally, we were not allowed to place international calls if not before paying $100 deposit. There was no understanding for our dire situation since my husband couldn't be left unattended. We were promised that someone would come up with a wireless card reader, but they never showed up. The day after, despite leaving the 100 USD deposit, it took ONE HOUR of bouncing between reception and operator to make our first call (Operator: you need to pay Me: I did Operator: call the reception to confirm; Reception: It's active tell the operator; Operator: the line isn't active - and so forth for one hour...). The following morning we woke up late due to previous exhausting day. We called the restaurant seeing if they would let me get food and again they denied. When my husband called Room service, he was told that breakfast was not served after 10:30 and it was literally 10:32. I went down, infuriated since my husband needed the food to take his pain medication and the manager promised to have two breakfasts brought up. My husband called down at 12:00 and the manager said that NOW he would ask. Ridiculous right? They didn't care about the situation at all.

I would venture to guess 90% of the guests at this hotel are here from Emirates; the staff seemed to be very adept at shuttling people in and out of the hotel. The rooms are clean, spacious, but very no-frills - the towels are thin and scratchy; the shampoo comes in packets; the prisoner grade bar shop generates no suds. But the beds are soft and the TV (with about five watchable channels) works....not that you're watching it anyway considering you'll want to fall asleep quickly before the alarm gets you up. Which leads to how ridiculously early they wake you up here - over two hours prior to your flight, despite it being literally five minutes away from the airport. You do not have a say in this matter - you arrive, tell them your flight, and they schedule your wake up call. We questioned this practice on our first stay here - really? We need to wake up at 3am for our 6am flight? - and were told that there are so many flights at that hour that Customs could be backed up. So we did....only to arrive to a virtually empty airport. Thank goodness McDonald's at the airport was open to keep us busy for the next two hours. So on the way back, we told them we really wanted more time; that we'd be okay with only an hour notice.....we were told it was not an option. So once again we were bored to death at the airport (since security was yet again only two people long). I guess they have to do it that way to best schedule the rooms since they are just a revolving welcome mat for Emirates passengers. One last note....most guests receive a free buffet ticket during their stay (which, by the way, is actually much, much better than I would have expected). I ate dinner and breakfast twice and watched as about 5% of the guests, despite getting a free meal, did not leave any tips to the hard working staff.

(The 4 hour tour is available during the day and costs 35 dollars; the 2 hour tour is available in the evening). The 4 hour tour hit most of the highlights, including a short boat ride across the canal and a museum visit (lots of fun for adults AND kids) but not the Burj Khalifa. (HINT: If you want to visit the world's largest building, make your reservation at least a day in advance, and pay only 25-30 dollars for the pleasure, instead of 125 dollars if you just show up). Emirates seems to want to keep its passengers well-fed. Meal and snack vouchers seem to rain upon you at check in, good for the buffet-style cafeteria. Food is available 24 hours, and dinner is served until 12:30 a.m. The buffet is pretty decent ... a reasonable variety of western and asian specialties, including pastas and curries for lunch and dinner. Yeah, the corridors of the hotel are long alright, as others have mentioned. This is a big hotel that can seem on the impersonal side. It is great for transit passengers, and it's free if you are traveling on Emirates.

The reception is geared towards clearing clients through very quickly and it was efficient if impersonal.

The meals were buffet style, soft drinks were included and I have no complaints about any of the meals. The room however was a different matter. Avoid the rooms on the ground floor that have no carpet as the passage of other clients would make the room very noisy as they tramp past to get to the lifts. I stayed at the end of the ground floor corridor and there was carpet on the corridor so noise wasn't too bad. The room is extremely basic. No in-room safe was the major issue along with no hair dryer (had to ask reception for one, when it came it shorted the electricity supply to the room, so we had to ask for another hair dryer in the morning - why don't they have one in the bathroom attached to the wall if they are so concerned about theft?). The toiletries were very substandard for a three half star property and shampoo was in a sachet. The hotel is not concerned about clients staying for one night and therefore this is a very basic hotel. Considering it was free, I can't complain about the price but no hair dryer is stupid!

They had arranged a call for 6am but I requested an earlier call for 5:30am as I wanted to squeeze in a spot of shopping at the airport. After this we went to our room. The room is more than adequate for an overnight stopover. Clean, comfy beds, nice shower etc etc. The problem came the next morning. My boyfriend and I were dead asleep when our phone rang (the wake up call) telling us it was time to check out. I sat up and checked my phone - it was 7:20am. We freaked out and ran out of our room so fast down to the check out desk. When I got there, I was not happy. I told the staff member our wake up call was for two hours ago and we were not contacted any earlier and there is a good chance we are going to miss our flight. All 10 other staff members behind the counter went silent and looked away. The one guy who would talk to me suggested a cab - I asked if he was going to pay for it and he promptly suggested the bus. The bus arrived 1 minute later so we jumped on. Turns out there was another traveller sitting next to us for the same flight that they failed to wake up. We made our gate by 10 minutes. Overall, for an airport stopover hotel, the wake up call incident is unforgiveable. They of all people should realise the importance of getting such details correct.", "Date": "August 4, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cooma, Australia", "Title": "\u201cFine for a Stopover\u201d", "Author": "tez823", "ReviewID": "UR17801802", "Content": "Emirates put us up here for a stopover.

Really close to the airport and completely buffered from external noise so all in all very convenient for stopover - especially with shuttle bus every half hour. Note: If you only have a short stopover - get your luggage checked through to your final destination from your departure port and carry on an overnight bag so you don't have to wait to collect your luggage when you arrive in Dubai as it can take up to an hour longer just to get your luggage.

It was appalling. Although clean, the rooms and bathrooms looked little changed from the late 1960's. It would barely have been more than one-star.

Buffet was very good - we were given vouchers for Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner plus light refreshments. Soft drinks were included in the buffet, alcohol is not - Alcoholic drinks are a bit on the pricey side as I found out when I ordered a couple of beers!!! On the negative side - we asked for our cases to be sent on to the hotel so that we had a change of clothes and washing gear for our stay. My wifes case arrived 6 hours later but mine never made it despite several phone calls to Emirates Customer Services and direct to the baggage handlers at Dubai Airport. Spending 48 hours in jeans and t shirt without a change of clothes in 40deg c termperatures is not the most pleasant experience. Although cant mark the hotel down for this.
