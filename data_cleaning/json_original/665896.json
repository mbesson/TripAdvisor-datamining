{"Reviews": [{"Content": "A Sliced of Paradise in Paradise! My first impression of my suite was that I was in the courtyard and was looking for my room. I was blown away when I was told the pool and outdoor living room were all part of my suite! The staff were very accomodating and helpful. Arianna, the assistant manager, took us on a tour of Bali and was an awesome person to talk to! He had a restaurant pick us up and give us beach seating at night so close to the beach that we could stick out or toes and almost feel the sea foam. He gave us some great advice and truly made it a great trip. More about the hotel: the breakfast was outstanding all three days. We had Nasi Goreng for breakfast with an asortment of noodles, pancackes, bread, and fresh fruit. Almost forgot, we had a pineapple filled with fresh fruit and a glass of juice upon arrival. We even had an extensive selection of cable tv that we could watch on our LCD tv's. The pool was very warm and was great to jump into after a hot day. We could even see the tv from our pool. One recommendation that i could suggest is to bring lots of bug repellent. Or, that the Sanya's install bug lights. I think i had about 12 mosquito bites on my arms and legs!The beds were very comfortable and the air conditioning worked very well. The outdoor jacuzzi bath tub was also great, but the hot water tended to run out about halfway through filling up the tub. So, maybe another hot water heater would help?All in all it was an amazing experience. If i ever come back to Bali, I will stay here. I've never had this level of service, comfort, or relaxation. We even had in-room massages! I've been to resorts and 5 star hotels the world over and this tops the list!Excellent, excellent, excellent! Highly recommend!", "Date": "Dec 3, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR232932228", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "hakujin41"}, {"Content": "A little piece of paradise My wife and I have just spent a week at the Sanyas Suite and it really is a great place to stay.Other reviewers have commented on the genuine service and that the accommodation is every bit as good (I think better) than the photos indicate.The Sanyas Suite is located a little north of the better know Samaya and other beach hotels in the area. It is an easy walk between the 2 properties.We looked at other properties from villa hotels like Samaya through to 6 hectare villa properties on our stay. For a couple, I would rank the Sanyas Suite higher than any property I viewed. If you had kids that wanted beach games or a big public pool, then it may be different.The Sanyas Suite is very low key, it is on a quiet little street but only about 30 metres from the busier street than runs down to Samaya, etc.Reception is open air, almost on the streetfront. The other streetfront aspect of the Sanyas Suite is the elevated restaurant.17 private villas are behind recption and the restaurant, via 2 manicured, landscape walkways. Access to each villa is via very tall, traditional Balinese timber gates. These gates are padlocked when you leave and can be latched close once you are inside.When you step through these gates you step into a little piece of paradise.The majority of the villas are 1 bedroom, several 2 bedroom and then 2 premium 2 bedroom villas located at the end of each walkway. The premium villas are 2 storey, are larger villas and have a bigger pool. This would be great for a family but the standard 1 bedroom villas are superb if it just the 2 of you staying.The layout and design of the Sanyas Suite villas is superior to say those at Samaya. I found a lot of wasted space at the Samaya villas and certainly there is better utilisation at Sanyas so you get more living space plus a small kitchen and a huge bathroom.The Sanyas Suite was built 2 years ago, is meticulously maintained and is owned by a local Indonesian family. We had an outdoor light bulb go one night and noticed the next night that the bulb had been replaced.Once you close your gate, the Sanyas Suite villas offer you absolute privacy. You hear or see nobody else, and there are no other villas peering down upon you. It feels like you are in your own little piece of paradise.The king bedroom is huge with dark timber floors which I much prefer to the usually poorly laid and unsealed Indonesian polished (and cracked) concrete floors which are now so common. The bedroom has a separate dressing area separated from the main part of the bedroom by a feature dark timber wall that the king bed rests against.All the timber, except the floorboards, are stained a very dark brown, almost black, and combined with the white walls and ample stone features provides a simple, yet contemporary look.The swimming pool in each villa is gorgeous. The pool is concrete lined with green granite tiles and off-white local stone on the capping and steps. Each pool has a mature Frangiapanni tree growing over it, providing about a 25% shade cover over the pool in the heat of the day.The landscaping is typically Balinese and is again meticulously maintained.There's cable TV if you want it and one of the great features is a full sized fridge that keeps your drinks icey cold.The weak point to the hotel is its restaurant. It is quite pricey and the service can be very slow even when there are almost no guests there. The waiter can disappear for 10 minutes at a time and even a fruit juice can take 10-15 minutes to prepare.This isn't a problem though as there are a host of restaurants within 5-10 minutes walk. The closest of these is only 50m from the front door and you can have a great meal for $5-$10 each.Also within 50m from the hotel is a Minimart and a beauty salon where you can get a great 1 hour massage for only 40,000 rupiah ... or a 1 hour facial for 25,000 rupiah (that's currently less than $4).The service from the hotel was superb. Whenever we wanted to head out, hotel staff would take us for free in their brand new aircon vehicles. Until you work out the way home, do make sure you take a supplied map with you as many of the taxis have no idea where to find the Sanyas Suite. In the end we would say go past Samaya and the Living Room restaurant (which they all know) and then just look out for the turnoff.We were so impressed and felt so relaxed that we would have loved to stay longer. Instead we've now booked to return in July next year.Overall, I give the Sanyas Suite the absolute highest rating possible.", "Date": "Oct 29, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR806880043", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "kpBunbury"}, {"Content": "Fantastic Villa, Friendly Staff, Haven for tired souls I had just came back from a two nights stay at the fabulous sanyas suite and the overall impression that they had given me was almost flawless. I had booked direct with the hotel and they gave me a v reasonable rate. Sanyas suite is located along one little remote path opposite lovely rice fields(which taxi drivers might have problems knowing its location but just showing the hotel's card will solve the problem easily) however it does not mean its far from everything.Upon arriving in the morning, they allow us to have 2 hours early check -in which was fantastic as it was quite tiring to have an early flight. We were led along a long path to our hotel and when we stepped in, the sight was exactly the same as what appeared on their hotel website. Everything was sparking clean, nice living room settings, FULLY Equipped kitchen( with everything you need, beer can opener,fridge, all plates and utensils etc etc), Awesome super king size bed, clean good sized swimming pool ,outdoor shower,and of cos the luxurious big two person jacuzzi bathtub decorated with full flowers( a minor minor bit faulty). The staff will then give a clear explanation of all the usage inside the villa while serving you refreshing towels and drinks.I had requested full flower decorations at e pool which was superbly romantic.One of the best point in Sanyas is that even though they had stated they only provide 3 daily free shuttles to the areas, but in fact they will try to accomodate free shuttles (w pick up) for you if there are no other visitors arriving or no tours booked. That saved us quite a lot of taxi fare.They had changed to buffet breakfast from in villa cooking ( as seen from previous posts and was a good change) and the standard was acceptable. Booked a half day tour with them, however the tour guide was not fluent with english but can see that he is trying his very best already. I did not have a chance to taste the restaurant level as the villa is located v near the food street in petitenget.(5 mins drive) They'll give u a v detailed map of seminyak at the reception.Lastly, I had a weird awkard return flight timing at midnight, and they gave me a transfer to the airport at 11pm with no grudges at all. Superbly satisfied and definitely a super -valued villa for couples on honeymoon if you want pool,jacuzzi, own living space.All the staffs were very friendly and helpful and they will try their best even if at times they do not understand you.The only minor setback might be the occasional noise from the villa beside.", "Date": "Oct 16, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR707654421", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "jaysheng"}, {"Content": "Our Bali home We booked to stay at Sanyas for 8 nights. We ended up staying about 16 nights. It is absolutely beautiful.We would have to say that the staff are probably the best part of our experience at Sanyas. They are very obliging and no matter what you require they will have it done. The General manager, Gede, assisted us without any problem with extending our stay, even though they were pretty much fully booked. We loved the fact that every day or evening you return to Sanyas, the staff are there smiling and happy to see you. I think my husband Andrew made some life long friends with the staff!The meals are good. You can eat in your room or in the restaurant. They have 24hr room service off the main menu. The buffet breakfast is good and has indonesian food as well as bacon, toast etc. The chef's presentation of the meals we ordered for dinner was amazing.The rooms: As we stayed a long time, we had the opportunity to see all catergories of rooms. The best in my opinion is the Junior suite. The pool is amazing and has a large living area. The beds are very very comfortable in all villas. The photos on the website are what you get. I would say everyone would be in awe entering the villa for the first time. They are all amazing. Also, they are extremely clean. The room service staff are very good and the floors are mopped every day. We loved this aspect as after a long day walking around Kuta you tend to feel pretty dirty and it's nice to return to somewhere clean.The location in our opinion is a bonus. Away from the hustle and bustle but not too far. Although sanyas provides a shuttle to Kuta, we found it easy to walk 15 metres to the corner of the street where it takes 30 seconds to flag down a taxi. Costs about $3 au to go to Kuta by taxi. Our only problem was trying to get back to Sanyas. Not many taxis know where it is, so it's a must to get a card with the address from reception to show the taxi driver.We will definately go back. I would highly recommend sanyas to anyone. It made our stay in Bali that much better. We miss the staff and it was sad to leave them. We have photos but they are the same as what's already on the reviews.", "Date": "Oct 1, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR719071838", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "jessiemax"}, {"Content": "So Relaxing - Best Staff!!

I have been to Bali over 25 times in the past 20 or so years and have experienced pretty much every level of accomodation from $5 Losmen to the Kuta Aussie weekend warrior hotels to some more sedate places in Seminyak. I am sure my tastes have changed as I have gotten older but the Sanyas Suites are exactly what I have been looking for.I will start with the one downside and get that out of the way. If you are looking at being in the heart of Kuta or walking distance to the beach this is not it, but if you can get your head around how easy transport is in Bali then that gets eliminated quickly. Sanyas is on the northern part of Seminyak and about a 5 minute moped ride from KuDeTa and the rest of Eat Street. If you are not comfortable on your own moped (and there is good reason not to be) then the very friendly staff can have a taxi at the door within about ten minutes if they cant run you where you want to go themselves. A taxi on the meter is only about Rp15,000 down to the beach at Double Six.So on to the accomodation. This place makes you feel like you own your own Villa in Bali. Great immaculate rooms with an outdoor living area and kitchen as well as your own pool set amongst a beautiful garden. When reseaching before staying I looked at thier website which has great pictures and thought - clearly they are showing only the best Villa - but I came to find out that they all look like what is on the website.The rooms are only surpassed by the great staff who are forever friendly and helpful. We stayed for 5 days before heading over to Gili Trawangan and have now just returned and the staff have gone out of thier way to make us feel like we are returning home.I am usually pretty slack about writing reviews but this place is deserving of some feedback.
