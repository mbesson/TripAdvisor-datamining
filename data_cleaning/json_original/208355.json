We stayed in a ground floor efficiency with two double beds and a pull out sofa. The room number was 115. This room was on the corner of the hotel so we had a window on the end and the large door and window on the oceanfront. Upon arrival we found a large puddle in front of the refrigerator. After calling the front desk, they sent someone immediately who took care of that. We found no other issues with the room. We found our room to be small but certainly comfortable for the two of us. The bathroom was small but recently remodeled with new everything. The room had new curtains, bedspreads and carpeting. Nothing felt dirty except the tile floor where the puddle had been, but once the puddle was cleaned up, that too was taken care of. The room was quiet even with it being a corner room and the mattresses very comfortable. We enjoyed our stay here. We simply walked out of our room, around the corner and directly to the beach access. The beach was not crowded (this was the Wed and Thur before Labor Day) and being on the boardwalk provided us with a great place to walk without being to busy. Even though our room was on the ground floor, we had a view of the ocean (not the breaking waves). We would certainly stay here again.", "Date": "September 6, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Elkridge, Maryland", "Title": "\u201cWould go back; here are things to know\u201d", "Author": "carusta123", "ReviewID": "UR139398738", "Content": "Three things, first I would go back.

We actually were able to move it ourselves to the top the cabinet to help somewhat (returning it before we left).

My girlfriend and I stayed in a premiere oceanfront room on the 5th floor. Overall the room was usable, but was not a good value for the money. I chose the Howard Johnson partially based off the name assuming there would be a higher quality standard than an independent hotel. The room was clean and odor free but there were several maintenance related issues that plagued our room, as well as a few other annoyances. First off none of the room doors worked correctly. The entrance door required a shove to open, similar to a break in seen on cops. The bathroom door also needed to be wedged and pushed into its frame to close. The sliding screen door did not slide very well to either open or close, it was quite frustrating to use. The main issue with the entrance door is that it does not seal out water when it rains. On the second day or our trip it rained for an hour or 2 and the first 4 feet of carpet inside the door became a soggy sponge, quite gross. Despite using towels to soak up some of the water the carpet was still damp when we left 2 days later. The bathroom was very, very small. The bathroom fixtures were updated and clean, but very small and no space to set anything down. The small kitchen counter space was nice and it was nice to have a small fridge and microwave. The balcony furniture was nice as well, 2 sturdy composite material chairs and a small table. Overall the hotel was not as updated as I would have expected from the 2011 renovations line of the description and the maintenance issues would make me avoid this hotel again.

We got to stay in one of the newly remodeled pool view rooms which was located on the 1st floor and had a great view of the pool area. We had a private patio which was quite large and had two very nice Adirondack style chairs as well as a small table. The room was very spacious. The bed comfortable. however, quite high off the ground. The room itself was very clean. Loved the soft carpeting and the sofa was comfortable as well. The room also had a table with two chairs, adequate lighting, a nice fridge and microwave. And, also, a coffeemaker, as well as several packets of coffee. The bathroom was really nice. I loved the oversized shower which was great when helping with my special needs sister. It was very clean and the shower pressure was great and the on/off was very easy to operate as well as the hot/cold setting. There was a heat light and vent which both worked well. A beautiful seashell pedestal sink with huge mirror above as well as large mirror on the door. There was also storage cabinets on the walls, which provided great space to store everything. They also provided complimentary mouthwash, shampoo, conditioner, hand lotion and soap. Towels were plentiful, large and soft. The bathroom was also newly tiled as well. The only problem we had was the shower was quite slippery even though it does have have built in non-slip strips, I almost fell the first time I used it. The tiling also was rather slippery, but just put towels down over it and had no problem. The only other thing which wasn't a really big deal was that we did hear foot traffic from above, but nothing that was to the extent that it was disruptive and our entire stay we did not hear our neighbors on either side of us. The entire staff from manager to clerks to housekeeping and maintenance were all very nice and made our visit enjoyable. The price was very budget friendly.

We had issues with getting the sliding glass door open, as I call it; it took 2 men and a small boy to get the door open, but we did get it open. We had a nice view of the ocean. On 9/10 we laid our son down for a afternoon nap to have that interrupted by the fire alarm going off at 2:30 pm, which we had to leave the room until the Fire Dept cleared it for everyone to return to there rooms, for the most part we chalked it to things happen. On 9/11 we were awakened by the alarm going off again at 8:30 am, again we had to leave the room until the Fire Dept cleared it for everyone to return to there rooms. On 9/12 we again were awakened at 12:30 am to the fire alarm and once again we had to leave the room until the Fire Dept cleared it for everyone to return to there rooms. After getting our son back to sleep and ourselves we again were awakened by the fire alarm at about 1:15 am. By this point I\u2019m passed pissed off, but what are you going to do. After we returned to our room our son is crying and does not want to stay here any more, after awhile I was able to calm him down so we could get him back to sleep. My wife had issues with something biting her legs and bottom while sleeping in her bed The floor was so dirty that we did not want our son playing on the floor. We found this out when he was wearing socks that the bottoms of them were black from the dirty carpet. There was water standing in the hallway in from of our friend\u2019s room 406 that was at least 1 inch deep and about an area of 4 foot by 6 foot so every time we went to there room we had to walk through it. The elevator certificate we noticed was going to expire on 9/11/09 and this was on the first day we arrived and by Friday it still was not corrected. We did have issues with the elevator not going to the floor pressed on several occasions. While checking out there were several people that were very unhappy with they stay and the hotel clerk stated that they will do something for us, but he did not know what that might be, we asked who we should contact and he showed us the address of the last page of the bill. We still paid full price for our stay and I guess we will wait and see it they are interested in refunding any money\u2019s or what they will or will not do. After checking out and we noticed that we were charged for the safe in the room at $1.50 per day not that it was going to put us in the poor house, but why are we charged for something we did not use or did we ask for.

I booked the rooms early and received a 25% discount. Had I paid the $299 regular rate for an oceanfront room I would have been somewhat disappointed. Like many Ocean City hotels, this is an older facility and I expected a smaller room with some dated features. However, the small bathrooms are updated with curved shower rods and newer appliances (an improvement over the yellow tiles at the Sahara). But, the water pressure in the shower was downright terrible. (I found myself missing the old style shower heads of the Sahara.) There is a newer kitchenette with a small sink, new microwave, toaster oven and fridge. This was one of the reasons we chose this hotel, and was a nice added feature. The location and view were great. The pool area is nice with adequate seating and a nice sized pool. I also liked being able to see the pool from my room and not have to walk across parking lots to get to it. Speaking of parking lots, no problems with parking and I liked that their lot is somewhat enclosed. No one can cut through the parking lot unless you are staying at the hotel. Now the downfalls...Overall, things were kept relatively clean, but not outstanding. The T.V. in our \"deluxe\" room was cracked and our remote had tape on the back (instead of a cover) to keep the batteries in place. Our air conditioning went out several times during the week and although a repairman came immediately to check on it, he basically told us that the units are old and they sometimes have problems with them. Other guests we spoke with had similar issues with their air conditioners. Sand built up all week around the outside shower by the pool; we never saw that area cleaned. We had to call the front desk at check in because our balcony chairs were covered in sand. I had to call the front desk again to have someone remove a half eaten sandwich that was in the hallway for 2 days. The maids were friendly, but unless you specifically asked them to clean something, you were given towels and a quick cleaning of the bathroom and nothing else.

Back then, it was family-owned and the service and maintenance was always rock-solid. It's probably been 12-15 years since it changed to a Howard Johnson's, and in that time, it has steadily declined in its level of maintenance, appearance and cleanliness. I've read that the Howard Johnson motel chain has scored near the bottom when it comes to the overall experience and this one is no exception. What does it have going for it? The location is right on the boardwalk at the quiet end on 24th street. You can't ask for a nicer spot for a family with children. You can take the boardwalk tram back from the busy end of the boardwalk and get off right in front of the motel. It has a nice pool and a parking lot adjacent to it. There is a miniature golf course and numerous restaurants within walking distance. There is an excellent restaurant for breakfast right in the motel. Now for the problems. We arrived during a heavy rainstorm after the check-in time and were informed that our room was not ready. A maid who was standing behind the check-in desk then informed the clerk that a room on a different floor was done, so the clerk gave us that room instead. When we got to the room, it was not done, and the maid was just starting to clean it at the time. We walked to the end of the floor where we could look out at the beach while the maid completed her work. The walkway had empty plastic bags, assorted trash, and a toilet plunger laying about. The bag was not picked up for two days. When we returned to the room we found it to be adequately clean but very worn. There was a hole in the wall near the bed and our daughter would not sleep on the side of the bed near it for fear a rodent would come through it as she slept. My wife turned the hot water on at the sink and the handle came off in her hand because the screw holding it on was missing. The sofa had torn cloth coming off at the bottom and the upholstery on the chair seat at the table was ripped. There were holes in the wall at both ends of the shower. At one point, I noticed ants crawling on the combination drawer and TV stand. My daughter asked me why all of the people who worked there were so unfriendly. The second evening we were there we ran into a woman who was removing her bags at 6:00. When I asked her if she was checking out late, she told me that she and her traveling companion had just checked in but they were now leaving the motel. When I asked why she said that the floor in her room was wet and the room smelled of mildew. Apparently the room had flooded during the heavy rain the night before. When we checked out at the end of our stay we overheard a woman telling the desk clerk that there was mold on the walls of her room. In our entire four day stay, the animated part of the motel sign along the street was stuck so that jibberish was all it displayed. No one bothered to fix it or at least turn it off. Just another example of what appears to be a disinterested management style. We decided on the way home that we'll look for a different place to stay when we return to Ocean City. At the price they charge, this place should be in better condition.

Our room opened to the outside near a steel staircase; the outdoor sprinkler system made a puddle of water at the top of the staircase, making them incredibly slippery. One full day after the sprinkler incident, the puddle was still there and the stairs were still wet. I slipped and fell down the stairs while carrying bags out of the room.

The first night we stayed there was Thursday and it was quiet, and very realxing! However, Friday evening, I honestly believe thay had nothing but partying in that building!! The guys beside us, sounded like they had brought a stereo from home and it was loud the whole stay!! They were screaming, hitting the walls, slamming doors and on the balcony using profanity. We called the front desk 3 times on different days about this, it would stop, and than couple hours later they were back at it again. we were told they were going to send security up, but apparently that never happened.

Ernesto came in ernest and basically shut down most everything.

I was advised that the manager advised there would be no refunds. Apparently others had also become concerned.We decided to stick it out. In the meantime we had water bubbles (huge) filled with water leaking in the room in several places. The carpet was wet etc. We were moved to another room, which was also leaking. It had not been cleaned properly and there was food from prior customers in the fridge. The elevator also stopped working. I spoke to the person at the desk and she advised I would need to speak to the manager in the am. In the am I again asked for some type of refund for the wet rooms & other issues. Then I was advised that the general manager had the nerve to say all of the hotels in OC probably had leaks ( not true, also had friends staying in other hotels and they were DRY) that shouldn't matter, we were customers at HJ and we had to pull the love seat to block part of the room to keep our children from getting wet.No refund no apology ,nothing.
