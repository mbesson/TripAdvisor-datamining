The beach is nice & calm, great area! They have plenty of seating, & shade for those who are not into tanning.. The rooms are very nice, big flat screen (great for connecting laptop to it). Comfy bed. The only Small drawback is that the bathroom is small, but in great shape! To me this is an awesome little gem!!!

Our first impression was less than great when we were greeted by dead kitten floating in pool the night we arrived, but later found out a litter of kittens had made the hotel their home. The room we had with ocean view was very nice not expansive but very comfortable for the price. Bathrooms were veryclean, but not luxurious. My biggest complaint (I'm an interior designer) is there should have been carpets in the rooms, like sisal or nylon sisal, because there is tile everywhere, and it would be nice for the wet and sand. Lots of outdoor seating with big chairs, day beds, sofas, tables, some even covered for the occasional rain storm. We went to the local Econo grocery store for cereal and sandwich fixings because we find the hotel food and frozen drinks, fair. But the pool, hot tub and beach are really wonderful. We'd sneak upstairs to the 4th Fl terrace where it overlooks the ocean and eat our private meal. Stay here, just plan to eat at some of the local great restaurants that are nearby. We didn't mind the 10 minute drive to Rincon to eat. We liked the privacy and the other guests were so interesting, the kind that like being off the beaten track, not your typical loud fat americans. The comments about the service are correct, for example one of the kittens slept in our room and pee'd and room service came immediately, only it was some guy who kind of knew how to make beds, but he did a great job, so who cares.

Check in and out was a breeze. The front desk was very helpful with questions, directions, restaurants and getting a van out to pick up our crew after an auto accident. No injuries - thank goodness - but be very careful driving in PR. Terrible drivers and most cars it seemed were missing lights at night - front, back, all - just be careful. Room keys seemed to be a problem - ended up going to the front desk several times to have them re-keyed. A pain but not terrible since the resort is not large. The place itself is very clean and the rooms were comfortable. There is not much to do at night or during the day for that matter for the kids - so they found it a bit dull. We did take some surfing lessons at Maria's Beach, which was fun - kids loved. Pool was fine and nice large hot tub. The beach went on for miles - so if walking the beach looking for sea glass is your \"thing\" then this is the place for you. Pools and ocean water was warm and great for swimming. Ocean was calm - easy swimming for kids. Sunsets were wonderful each night! Ate breakfast at the hotel- It was OK - nothing spectacular - you won't go hungry and it is resonably priced. Ate luch at the pool bar/restaurant - wraps were good and all else was OK, Again, you wont' starve. We ate offsite at Calypso's, The Rum Shack and Villa Confressi - ordered pizza and ate in the lobby another evening. Fun atmosphere at Calypso's and the Rum Shack. Food was fine.

Last year I went to Rincon for president's day weekend and I decided to do the same this year. This property has a swim up bar so we figured there would probably be less children then at other resorts. Well we were wrong. There were a lot of children. We wanted a get away and it could have been a bit more relaxing without children but in all honesty there were a few drunk people living at the swim up bar that were far more of a nuisance then the well behaved children. We booked a deluxe ocean view room and ended up with a view of the play ground so we heard the kids playing in the morning. I never remembered reading on their site that there was a play ground. We arrived at around noon and our room was not ready until about 5PM. It was a holiday weekend so I am sure they were scrambling but we had booked our room 6 weeks prior. The room was \"OK.\" There was a tiny fridge on the floor. The lights by the bed did NOT turn off unless you moved the furniture and unplugged them, and the beds were very, very hard to the point my back was hurting both mornings. The swim up bar was a lot of fun but my friend that was with me in San Francisco and who owns a bar of his own expected the bar tender to help people in order. I told my friend that this is Puerto Rico and you have to shout to get service. So he adapted to the Puerto Rican ways. The bar tender was really good at concocting the perfect drink for each person. Some of those were super crazy strong. We decided not to go in the pool the second day because there were about a dozen people drinking from 11 AM to sunset and they never left the pool. I can only imagine how many chemicals would be needed to be dumped in there to clean out all of their urine. So we opted for the ocean instead which was more fun. The place was fine, not worth the 275 for Sat night but Sunday night was 125 which was a fine price for the place. I would skip their breakfast buffet and find something else.

It was our first time in this hotel and our experience was extremely pleasant. Although it is not a 5 star hotel, they made us feel at home. For $199 a night, including taxes and breakfast for 2 every morning, there is not much more you can ask for. Breakfast is a la carte (weekends are a la carte and buffet) with very creative and delicious alternatives. A note about breakfast charges: breakfast was included in our package but you have to sign for the charges to your room. Then, at check-out, those charges are deducted from your bill. The pool bar is very good and the bartender, Jose, is extremely good and friendly. The pool restaurant is also very good and offers a variety of dishes, from burgers to ribs and everything in between. The room we selected had two beds, very comfortable, a view of the pool from the balcony and was spacious. Housekeeping was prompt and efficient. Every employee we met was very nice and courteous. Even the janitors said hello every time they met you. Brasas restaurant served very good food. It is not cheap but the quality of the food made it worthwhile. Check-in and check-out was fast and effortless. The beach is good with minimal surf, although at this time of the year, the water is cold by tropical standards. You can walk on the beach for a long time but use sunblock or you will regret it. If you like picking what I call \"drift glass\" (pieces of broken glass polished by the sand and gravel and wave action) there are lots of them. We were very impressed with this hotel and plan to return in the near future. The hotel was not crowded due to the fact that we arrived on Thursday and classes were in session. I expect that during summer it will be crowded. There is no casino or disco in this hotel but who cares. We go to hotels to relax and have quality time together.

There were two male staffers that were fantastic, the others, however, seemed mildly disinterested in everything, including the customers. The pool was quite nice, the beach area was nice but not particularly interesting, as there were no fish that could be viewed snorkeling and no waves for body boarding.

The hallways were all outdoors and there were a fair number of dead bugs everywhere. I know it is the caribbean, but it wouldn't have killed them to mop it down every once in awhile.

I always ask to see the room before I take the room key, and try to finagle a better room by offering more and more money until its the room I like. You can almost always find a happy medium.

We ate at the restaurant at the resort the first night, it was decent. The pool bar had decent food as well, if you like fish I would suggest the Tuna sandwhich....it was great! It is best to have a car if you are staying here, I would suggest it highly since you will be able to see a lot more and you can go and enjoy other local restaurants that are close by. The Lighthouse that is past Rincon is a wonderful place to see great views and you will drive through the town Rincon itself. There is a local grocery in Rincon that we ended up buying some drinks at, this was called Econo. All in all this was a wonderful stay and the people at the hotel were very nice.

The drive took us about 5 hours with intense traffic, and the way you have to go through towns as the roads forces you. Tired and curious, we arrived at the Rincon Resort at sunset. There were only about 10 cars in the parking lot. The front desk agent was straight forward\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\u00e2\u20ac\ufffdHere is your key and this is how you get to your room\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd . To our dismay, the room was far from anything called \u00e2\u20ac\u0153De Luxe\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd accommodations, as it says in the website and the brochure. It was a handicapped room on the first floor, although we are not handicapped and never asked for a handicapped room! The \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Zenith\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd TV was from the 1990\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and had operational problems. The towels (just 1 per guest) were the quality of a $1 dollar store. Other items in the room were just the same, completely out of industry standards\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6Bad ambiance light, outdated art work, grease cushions and extremely cold tile flooring, with no rugs. There was a wood box inside the closet, containing the frig. The box was so bitten and chipped that looked like a piece got from a dumpster. The ceiling was finished with \u00e2\u20ac\u0153pop corn texture\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd . The bed smelled like damp, and since there were no screen doors to the terrace, the bugs (mosquitoes) invaded the room. The terrace faced a metal fence (the property\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s limit) and some greenery \u00e2\u20ac\u201c A very dull and unattractive view (well, NO view) - I went to the front desk and asked if they could give us another room as we were not happy at all with what they gave us. The front desk agent said she only had ONE other room, and gave me the key so I could go see it. This other room was very similar, but with a ceiling fan hanging from a pole that was bent, making loud noises to perform because it was totally crooked. I went back to the front desk and explained what I saw. The woman reacted as if what I reported was impossible! She said she didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have any other rooms available, but maybe the next day. No, how come they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have another room with10 cars in the parking lot!? I gathered the hotel had at least 50 rooms. Back in the handicapped room, I spent about \u00c2\u00bd hour killing mosquitoes before going to sleep, as they were buzzing in our ears and biting us. The next morning at 7 AM, we woke up with MAJOR noise coming from upstairs. An attendant decided to move furniture in the room right above us, by dragging each piece out to the terrace.I walked outside the room and yelled at him upstairs, begging to stop the noise. He was apologetic, but why in heavens a staff person would do some like that?! Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t they know guests are probably sleeping at 7am when they are on vacation? The resort itself, the beach and the pool looked ok, but nothing special that you dream about the Caribbean. You can not walk to anywhere for food due to the resort location, unless you drive several miles. If you depend to eat on the \"resort\" your only choice is the very \u00e2\u20ac\u0153cold\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd restaurant that has a large glass window that doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t open. Water drips down this glass window because the air conditioning temperature inside is 50 degrees, while it is 90 degrees outside. After eating an overpriced breakfast with our sweaters on, we decided to leave. Checking-out at the front desk, the manager came over and looked straight down to the computer to \"approve\" the cancellation. She never looked at us, or asked why we were leaving 3 days earlier\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6She just stroke a few keys in the computer and went straight back to her office. Our conclusion is\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6The Rincon Resort staff is FAR from accomplishing adequate costumer service or any effort to make guests enjoy their stay.

In general, we liked it, and felt it was a good deal. The location was lovely, although it's about a 2-hour drive from San Juan, which can include some tough traffic if you're traveling on a weekday. The staff was nice, the infinity pool was terrific, we liked the food at the restaurant, there was a beautiful beach 3 steps from the pool, and there were some nice amenities (paddle boats, kayaks, ping-pong, 2 giant chess boards, pool bar). We also liked our little patio/balcony for sitting and gazing at the ocean. There was only one breakfast option, a $15 buffet, which was OK but you don't want that much every morning so you might want to head out to one of the nearby bakeries instead. You could get a decent lunch at the pool grille, and the dinner menu included lots of yummy tapas -- even though they didn't do room service, they were fine with packing an order up for you to take back to your room. We REALLY recommend The Shipwreck in Rincon for dinner, and our server recommended The English Rose for breakfast, but we didn't get there. Just to be clear, I couldn't tell from the site, the maps, and these reviews just how far away the beach is -- it's RIGHT THERE. We had a first floor room and we could go out our back door and be at the pool in ten strides, on the beach in 20. That was really nice. When we were there, the ocean was quite warm and calm, and we had pretty sunsets every night. The meh: the resort is under construction, and it shows. We had a great time there, but it makes a very poor impression when you arrive -- plywood and corrugated metal and 2x4s all around the entrance. They should really put up some neutral murals or panels to hide the construction -- wouldn't be hard to do. They had the wrong rate for us when we checked in (too high) but corrected immediately & apologetically when I pointed it out. The room was tired -- lots of scratches/chips on the dark-wood furniture, only one limp pillow per person, broken clock (housekeeping fixed both of these immediately), h/c shower plate spun on the mounting so you couldn't tell where to position the faucet (which didn't matter, since it didn't get very hot anyway), and a vent in the bathroom that emptied straight into the courtyard/walkway so they could hear you and you could hear them, as if you were in the same room. One major problem, about which we and others complained: on the first two of our three nights, they had private functions in the big open courtyard, so guests couldn't use it. Further, the second night the wedding in the courtyard (10 feet from our door) was so loud that we had to turn our TV all the way up to hear it, and that went on until 11. The last night, the courtyard was so lovely we really regretted not having access to it the first two nights. We also paid $75 apiece for 3-hour surfing lessons through Rincon Surf School one day, and drove 30 minutes to Isabela to Tropical Trail Rides for a 2-hour sunset horseback ride on the beach for $45 -- BEAUTIFUL. One of the nicest trail rides I've been on -- lots of beach time, some time in an almond and pine forest, and the horses trot a bit, not just plodding along one after the other. On our way back to San Juan, we visited the Rio Camuy Caves (OK) and the Cagua Ceremonial Park, a site where the native Taino people lived and worshiped for 400 years (simple, but interesting).

The pools are large and its on the beach The Not so Good: You have to pay for your entire stay upfront. My guess is because most people will want to leave once they see the rooms and experience the lack of service. Rooms are on the older side but OK. Bathrooms are beat up. Housekeeping is minimal, dirt and sand is left on the floor each day , Hair in bathroom upon arrival, etc. Tiny ants included at no additional charge. The hotel has wireless (~10.00), but not from the room. I had to sit in the lobby to get a connection I dropped Laundry off to be pressed and cleaned, it was returned 48 hrs later , but still not washed. The staffs was not surprised, I believe happens often. Fitness center ( 4th floor in a converted guest room) is tiny and you need a special key to get into it ( it took 2 days to get the key from the Front desk. ( key machine broken- deal with it!). Elevator in that building was broken for all 5 days, no effort to have it repaired. The service is terrible. Expect to wait and wait and wait. Restaurant: The restaurant dinner service is painfully slow, and the meals delivered were not correct. The waiter did not check with the table . I stopped eating breakfast due to the delay in getting a cup of tea or a check. Bar Area: Food ordered (after a long delay for an order to be taken) in the bar was delivered without any silverware. Actually had to pull the bartender away from his friends to order a drink (he immediately returned to his discussion and ignored us for the next 90 minutes ). Overall , the staff just couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t care less. When you are there you are tolerated, if you leave and never return they are fine with that too ( no guests means they work less so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s considered by the staff to be a good deal ). I made two attempts to contact managers (Jose Rodrigues and William Crespo). They are never available and although I was told they would contact me, it never happened. Tips If you must stay there, ask for a room with a ocean view and a working elevator. --There are no good alternative restaurants in the area ( the Coach is bad too). Your best bet is to go to the supermarket near Walgreens and get your own food ( the hotel staff is cool with it since you feed yourself and it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t require them to provide food service). --You will need a car, there is nothing in the immediate area. --The beach is littered with broken bottles. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t walk without shoes --In order to prevent the room ants from following you home: As soon as you get home, wash everything in your luggage and leave the suitcase in the garage for a few days .", "Date": "February 15, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "State College, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cGreat in 2007\u201d", "Author": "CSK1", "ReviewID": "UR55725620", "Content": "This trip was several years ago, but then the beach, room and pool areas were wonderful.

We very much enjoyed our stay in puerto rico and found rincon to have lots to do and see. The name of the hotel is deceving, if you actually look on a map the hotel is located in a different town called Anesco, which is a ten minute drive to Rincon. We found this to be extreemly annoying as we needed to get in the car (which we did not rent until the second day becuase we thought we would be right in the town) just to go to the surfing spots, grocery store and shops. There is a cheap supermarker called the econo that was helpful to stock up on soda water and even cases of beer. The hotel itself was very clean and mangement did everything they could to accomidate their guests. The hotel is small, you saw the same 10 people at the pool everyday and did not get much variety. There was resturante that served breakfast and dinner and an outdoor grill that served lunch (all were very pricy). Down the street is a empanada place that has $1.00 empanadas, they were delious and cheap. Another place located in the rincon town is Tamboo, it has delious meals, is right on the beach and is a dance club thing at night. The holiday in is off the main road which has a casino that we enjoyed and won from! I recomend getting a car (it was very cheap) when you arrive at the airport. It was a pain to drive back 40 minutes to the airport the following day to rent one as well as pay the cab fee. Rincon and puerto rico itself has lots to see and a car is the best way to do it.

Let me say up front that we travel alot and we are not picky travellers. First, the good. The staff are great. They are very friendly and willing to help. We arrived in the middle of the night and we were greeted very nicely and our room ready. Everyone at the front desk we spoke to was very nice. They also speak very good english in this area of PR, unlike San Juan where it is more hit or miss. The grounds are very nice. The pool is beautiful and the swin up bar was great. Steps from the pool is your very own beach. The view is beautiful and there are plenty of seats in the shade or the sun. The pool side snack bar had good food and was very reasonably priced. (Side note: There are several stray dogs living on this beach. They are incredibly nice and will become your best friend almost instantly. We bought them food and gave them water each day) Now, the bad. The rooms at this \"resort\" are incredibly average for the money they charge. Honestly, the rooms are barely above the level of a Motel 6 here in the USA. There were two beds and a tv. Nothing fancy. The rooms are very dated and are not cleaned all that well (although the bedding was clean). The bathrooms are out of date also. We had ants in there the entire time. We live in FL so we understand that pests are a constant problem, but we expected better from a resort like this. We complained to the front desk and they sent someone to spray. That helped but never solved the problem completely. The air conditioner was very loud in the room and woke us up many times. The fridge didn't work and we needed to have them replace it with another. The \"ocean view\" was not the best view you could have. There are many trees in the way making the view tough. Also, our patio was not covered so in the day it was so bright and hot you could not sit out there. If it rained you were stuck inside. They did have a sunset viewing deck on the top floor, but that kinfdof defeats the purpose of an ocean view room. The onsite restaurant was over priced, we thought, but the food was decent. There are soda machines and an ice machine on site (on the top floor), but there is no where to buy a bottle of water (not the gift shop either). If you stay here I recommend you buy some water/soda/beer and use the fridge. This is cheaper and more convenient. There is a grocery store (Econo) about 5 miles away. Now some points on the area in general. Unlike San Juan, it is not very easy to find your way around here. Addresses are much like the one on the hotels website (a mile marker on a numbered road). The GPS does not do well with this. That being said, there are some great places to go eat/drink in the area if you can find them. Just up the road from the hotel is a great empanada place called Kaplash. Try this for lunch and sit on the ocean view deck. Cheap and wonderful. Another great lunch place is Hacienda Latina in Mayaguez. For dinner we ate at Tamboo and The Spot. Both great places with nice menus. The Spot is a seafood place and is a little pricey, but very good. We went at night but apparently they have a daily happy hour for the sunset also. Things are far away so a rental car is a necessity here. Just make you get get good directions from the hotel staff or you will certianly get lost. All in all we had a wonderful time, but unfortunately it has little to do with this particular resort. I am not sure what other choices there are in the area, but I would look around a bit. I do highly recommend this part of PR, but I think for the money you should be able to do better than this resort.", "Date": "December 13, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cSucks\u201d", "Author": "Hs163", "ReviewID": "UR51115182", "Content": "Staff sucks, food sucks and service really sucks.", "Date": "December 12, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Delaware", "Title": "\u201cLoved it!\u201d", "Author": "DelawareSofie", "ReviewID": "UR49146516", "Content": "We got an awesome deal on our room, so the price was perfect!

It was our first trip to Puerto Rico. Being early-to-mid-July, it was pretty darn hot when sightseeing in Old San Juan. It was a nice relief to come to the peace and quiet of the RBR. Overall, we enjoyed our stay at the RBR and would come back to it again. The woman who handled our check-in said there were no rooms with two beds left despite our online reservation for a two-bed room. She offered us a room with a king bed. Once in the room, we heard noise from the adjacent room through the (locked) adjoining door, so we went back to the reception, talked to a man who was now at the front desk, and asked for another room. Miraculously, now they had rooms with two beds available, not one but two! Huh? Ten minutes ago the woman said the hotel was full (which we found out from other hotel staff later was not the case) and she had absolutely nothing else left, now the man helping us offered us two rooms to choose from. We're grateful that they accommodated our noise concerns, but we couldn't help but think that the first woman did not honor our online reservation for the two-bed room when she could have. Once we got a room change, everything was smooth from there on. The room was comfortable and spacious and fairly clean. I said \"fairly clean\" because each day we would find several new long black hairs in our room that could not have come from either of us. We believe they might have come from the cleaning staff, so wearing a hairnet would be our recommendation to make their work more efficient. Another downside of the room is that we could hear furniture moved back and forth in the room above, because chairs in the room have legs made of iron and the floors are tiled. We resolved the problem by wearing ear plugs every night. It's a drag to wear ear plugs, but they did the job and we had good sleep. Enough with the minor complaints, now the compliments. The hotel's grounds were very well kept and the beach was right there. They did a good job grooming the plants and cleaning the beach. The pools were also attractive, overlooking the beach. The hotel's architecture is a colonial Spanish style, and is in very good shape as if it has been recently renovated. The flowers and trees in the gardens were gorgeous and well tended (see the trees with red blossom in the courtyard). Staff was friendly and helpful (except for the female staff member at reception we first encountered). Wireless Internet access in the lobby and courtyard area. I was thankful that the hotel did not play loud music in the public areas like many other resorts do at the pool. This allowed guests to enjoy their own music using their own private music players. We heard that July was when Puerto Rican families took vacation, and the guests at the hotel we saw seemed confirm that. Lots of families with kids, but the children were all behaving reasonably well for public areas (I am not a big fan of loud, rowdy children running around). Beach: Let's not forget the beach-the biggest asset of the resort. The beach is a reasonably long gentle crescent-shaped beach that is clean and quiet. I went for runs in the morning (7-8 a.m.) and hardly saw anyone else. The next beach over was easily accessible by the public, and on weekends we saw local people hanging out there in the evening, enjoying the water and the sun. Still, that was relatively far from the RBR, and RBR guests would feel as if they are on a private beach. Next door to RBR is a condo building, but it was not a big development and there were very few people coming from there, and their staff tidied up their portion of the beach. This makes the beach at RBR quiet, clean, and peaceful. Nice vegetation on beach and very calm water made the beach the star of our vacation--a tropical paradise that we'd dreamed of visiting. Food & Drinks: We had dinner at the hotel's restaurant one night. It was good but nothing spectacular. The price was high, but reasonable for an out-of-the-way resort, and compared to the surprisingly high prices in other restaurants we went to in PR, it was not prohibitively expensive. It is worth it if you want convenience or did not have a car. We went shopping at local supermarkets (5-10 minutes drive in either direction from the hotel) and bought beverages and chilled them in the in-room refrigerator. This saved us a lot of money, and we were able to drink our beverages on the beach and the pool area. We had lunch ordered poolside, and it was a decent cheeseburger with the price towards the high side but not exorbitant. Other attractions: - Drive north to Rincon (10-15 minutes) for restaurants and supplies. In July, it was like a ghost town, but we imagined a different vibe when surf's up. - Drive south to Cabo Rojo to see the salt flat, have lunch at the beautiful Parador Bahia Salinas, and swim at the lovely beach called Playuela near the lighthouse which is popular among local sun-and-sea lovers.", "Date": "July 31, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "N.

Parking is several yards from the hotel itself, where theft is a problem. We traveled with another couple, and here is a list of problems we had with our rooms: 1. TV's did NOT work in either room. This must not have been an isolated incident as there were several guests gathered in the lobby watching tv. 2. Toilet did not flush in our room. 3. Phones did NOT work in either room. 4. There were dead bugs in the bathrooms and on the floor. 5. We were supposed to have a King bed, they gave us 2 double beds. 6. Ocean view? Not so much. If you stretch you might catch a glimpse after looking over the other buildings, playground, and pool. 7. There are very few eateries in the area and they are pricey, one couple we spoke w/ had eaten at the same place every night for a week. 8. The floors in the rooms were just gross! They were visibly dirty. 9. One of the elevators did not work and according to other guests it had been down the prior week also. 10. The Beach: If are you looking for white sandy beaches this is NOT the place for you. The beach is literally brown, while the water is far from clear. I will say the pool was decent but is advertised as an infinity pool which it most certainly is not. The bugs here are HUGE and EVERYWHERE as the lobby is open-air.

There was a bar that you could swim up to in the pool that was never opened the whole time we were there. The Bartender was great i wish i could remember his name but i guess one of the signs of a good bartender is not remembering :) The restaurant staff was also helpful and very nice. The Front desk staff was just awful the whole trip. When we arrived we had to wait for the 2 women to stop talking about their weekend before they even checked us in. They were talking in Spanish and guess they thought my wife did not speak Spanish. We wanted to go to dinner that night and asked if the front desk staff had any ideas. Only 1 guy even answered us. There were 4 people working. When we asked for a map of the area, we were told they did not have one. I found one on the front desk in a holder. They did not even acknowledge us, they just went back to talking. We were never greeted when we came in or left. Any time we went to the desk it felt like you were bothering them just being there. On the last day we were checking out. Again we were not greeted, asked how our stay was, anything. My wife asked for a water, the woman looked at her and then went right back to checking us out like she did not hear her. She was training someone, and took 10-15 min to check out. She did not say anything to us about it. Did not ask if it was ok to train her, if we were in a hurry or anything. After we paid, the woman turned her back to us to talk to another woman that worked there that had walked in wearing sunglasses, asking why she had them on in here. The woman in the glasses went on about how drunk she was from the night before. The woman that checked us out never said goodbye, we were done, nothing. All in all if you want a place to relax and do not need anything from the staff it is an ok place. If you need any service at all this is not the place for you. Since this is a service industry, no matter how nice the property is, if the service is this bad it ruins the whole trip. Service is one of the most important things about a hotel, and can make or break the experience. I am a very easy traveler and have only ever wrote 1 other bad review and that was about The Princess hotel in Belize City, if you have been there you truly understand. Before going i read all the reviews about how good the staff was and realy hoped for a good trip. This was the first trip my wife and I have been able to take in 10 years and we had hoped it would be so much better than it was.", "Date": "May 21, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cape Girardeau, MO", "Title": "\u201cI wanna go back!\u201d", "Author": "iblisa", "ReviewID": "UR29943950", "Content": "Perfect romantic getaway!

When we first arrived, the room safe didn't work, the air conditioner didn't work, and several other little things didn't work (like window latches, TV cabinet closure,and the tub drain stopper) We decided to concentrate on the important air conditioner and safe ,and reported these to the front desk. We were assured these things would be fixed promptly, but we really didn't believe it., as the hotel seemed really busy. Within 2 hours, they had fixed the safe and actually replaced the AC with a different one that worked! That is fast service and we were impressed! The hotel beach is very nice for swimming or long walks. We felt safe. Plenty of shade palms if you need them. The pool is very clean and beautiful. The lobby areas are beautiful and well landscaped. The staff was very quick to accomodate any request. The beach towels are really thick and nice, and it's easy to \"trade\" your sandy wet ones for nice fresh ones. The first 2 days we were there, we were afraid the hotel restaurant would be too expensive for breakfast, so we ate elsewhere. The third day, we decided to look at the menu, and the prices were affordable, so we tried it. The breakfasts were huge, delicious, attractive, and the coffee was included.!!! For $7.50, you could get an omelette, choice of meats, toast, potatoes, fruit, and coffee. For $6.50 we got the almond french toast with fruit and coffee. It came with whipped cream, and a delicious guava butter, and the bread used to make it was like a homemade french bread. All this, and ....a beautiful view, white linens, nice china and flatware and great service, We couldn't believe we had \"wasted\" the first 2 days eating elsewhere trying to save a buck. Needless to say, we ate there every day after that. One thing I think this hotel could improve on is that the room was dusty. It got mopped daily, clean sheets, bathroom cleaned, etc. daily. But - the ceiling fan, furniture, chairs, picture frames, and headboard, all were full of dust when we arrived, and never got cleaned. We tipped daily, and overall the maid service was good, but they really do need to invest in some Endust and a duster.

After a very pleasant 2005 stay with two small children (then aged 6 and 5), we returned to the Rincon Beach Resort last month (with the active encouragement of our daughters, who had fond memories of the hot tub and mango smoothies at the swim-up pool bar), and found that the hotel just as pleasant as before. The grounds are immaculate, self-contained and smallish, which affords children the luxury of roaming with minimal supervision. The setting is quiet and very peaceful, on a long crescent of undeveloped beach - excellent for walks. The pool, large hot tub and gentle surf beach are well-maintained and ideal for children and grown-ups alike. The service is friendly and unobtrusive. We were particularly grateful that the staff allowed us to downgrade from a suite to a smaller room, which better met our budget and needs this time around. The rooms are fine, if unexceptional, and have refrigerators for snacks or small meals. Aside from a small playground and oversized chess boards, there's not too much to do (the resort charges for kayaks and paddle boats), but none of us minded the quiet, and we easily passed six tranquil days in this oceanside paradise. The poolside snack bar serves good lunch fare at reasonable prices; the restaurant is a bit pricey and our meals there were just average, but Rincon is just five minutes away, and a good alternative for dinner and wave watching. The gym is average at best, but who wants to be inside with a beautiful beach beckoning.

The pool area is lovely, clean and beautifully landscaped, a great place for a late afternoon drink.

By 11:30 PM Eastern Time I was just putting in my credit card info when Expedia's site went down! They had a little page up that said, \"Sorry! Working on the site - Come back tomorrow\" So I did. I booked it, but no reference to the gas card so I called and they SAID they would honor the gas card, but they never did. Repeated emails went totally ignored. THEREFORE: Being on a tight budget, we didn't drive around the island much. Rincon Beach Resort, as the previous writer said, was beautiful, but it was completely quiet which WAS what we wanted in our stay. We also had the good luck that the pool bar and outdoor grill bar were open most of the times we were at the pool. (We were there August 22 through August 29: The bars and even the pool are going to be closed in early September!). We noticed that things did tend to close anyway when it rained each day, so if you were there between say 3 PM and 6 PM it might be closed for the latter part of the bars' hours. Also, August is not \"high season\" (August in the Carribean..duh) so there weren't probably enough customers to justify opening much later. Many times it was just us two at the pool side bar for example, and we just ordered our one beer. Things to do: They do have QUIET activities on site: Plaza bar and TVs, exercise room, Giant Chess boards, tennis, golf putting green and we saw children on the playground. Also sailing and kayaking rentals are available there. Friends we met at the RBR did a heck of a lot, however. (Bigger budget, I guess!) They went snorkeling, zip-lining, to the luminescent bay explored a festival in Ponce and shopping in Rincon and Mayaguez.; however as the previous review said that's all outside and beyond the resort. We did wander to Arecibo (observatory - good for astronomy enthusiasts) Rincon (a few quaint shops). The Lazy Parrot was completely dead when we went @ 5 PM one weekday, although the Calypso Cafe around the corner was hopping!

Jacuzzi had cold water, most ocean view balconies are blocked by palm trees, the sun sets past a mountain that blocks that view, so you have to drive more westward to catch it.

Thank Goodness we rented a car, we left the resort daily trying to find things to do and decent food to eat. Only used the resort to sleep, except the last day when everything was finally open. By the way, you will find the West side of the island is more rustic and laid back in general. Many roads are not well marked, most places do not have actual addresses!

We stayed from Wednesday until Saturday morning and we were glad to be checking out then. Our experience evidenced that until late Thursday afternoon ... early evening, guests recieve the attention of the hotel staff; however, this all changes with the arrival of the \"San Juan\" crew. Late Thursday's into Friday the hotel becomes very busy with the arrival of young (20's to 30's and possibly 40's) professioinals from San Juan who come to party!!!!!! The hotel staff issues blue bands for all guest to wear, the police begin to partol the beach via boat and horsebac k and hotel security is increased to be very visisble. Unfortunately, as the \"San Juan\" crew unwinded, the Friday evening noise rose and continued until 3:00 am with loud arguments, audible shouted profanity in the hallways outside bedrooms, breaking glass, and inoperable elevators to contend with the following morning. A word to the wise, if you go, book your vacation to leave on (or by) Friday morning and head back to San Juan to enjoy the fine dining, casinos and clubs found there since you will not sleep well due to the noise ongoing outside your room. Good things to say about the resort.....enjoy breakfast every day in the hotel's restaurant. Everything was very good, prepared correctly, bountiful, restocked quickly, and the coffee was enjoyable. In fact, breaksfast was so large, you could almost skip lunch with a quick snack later on. Use the pool in the morning and head to the beaches in the afternoon. Also, see Rincon, drive the roads and seek out the other beaches in the area.....Tres Hermanos is the last of the surfing beaches and is well worth the trip. Enjoy a late snack or early dinner at Tamboo. Tamboo sits right on the beach, a great palce to watch the waves and they welcomed many a drenched customer who came in to escape a sudden downpour. The staff did not make a fuss regarding the hassle of taking in refugees, moved tables to make room for all, offerred towels to dry people off, and never once made a guest feel that they had overstayed their welcome while the rain continued. Also. seek out Casa Islena Inn in Rincon (it is locted near Tamboo). This island inn offers an excellent Tapas bar in late afternoon, which was wonderful.

We have found the Junior Suites rooms that are poolside to be quite nice (or at least nicer) and have generally enjoyed the out of the way, quiet location. However, this time we booked a 2 room suite in the tower. The room was quite large, but the furnishings are VERY worn out. The room smelled very musty (it was mold in the furnishings) and they had to spray the room daily to keep the odor down. From the different rooms that I've stayed in, I don't sense that furnishings have been updated at all in any rooms that I have stayed in over the years since the hotel opened (significant scratches on wood furniture, subtle tears in curtains, worn fabrics on seating,...). THis was a radical difference from the quality of the San Juan Marriott (very high quality) that we stayed at this time as well - not what I expect from a Rincon Beach Resort that touts it's acclaimed amenities. (also, can't compare \"western\" style service to this. You've gone native here - service can be indifferent - very uneven standards - it's a \"boutique\"!) On the outside, the setting is very pretty and grounds and exterior are generally well maintained. The pool is the largest and deepest that we've found on the west coast of Puerto Rico. My son likes the small deep end (~5-6 ft). Most pools around the area are small and have no deep end. BUT: * The pool STILL has EXTENSIVE black algae problems - they DO NOT maintain the pool well. * One day we were there, the jacuzzi was deep green! THey didn't bother closing it. Another algae problem that they reduced by the next day, but SHEESH! Also, if you book when there is a major event occurring, events are held in the open courtyard. The week we were there they had a film festival (nice) and a wedding. The wedding party had EXTREMELY LOUD music that ran past 11PM and reverberated throughout the rooms (most rooms face the courtyard). Definitely disturbing - typical - it's happened on at least 2 of our stays. The two bedroom suite was NOT worth the money. Bottom Line - * Stick with Jr Suite, * avoid school vacation times, * expect local crush on wkends, * expect low key, quiet surroundings, * pray for no special events because the noise is stifling * hope they fix the pool problems/maintenance * hope they upgrade the worn out furnishings (don't count on it) * lunch menu at the cafe is good and reasonably priced * dinner is nice but overpriced. head out. * not too exciting for teens (nothing really to do), unless you take them up the road to surf", "Date": "May 8, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Phoenix", "Title": "\u201cOkay, but...\u201d", "Author": "PhxED", "ReviewID": "UR15716735", "Content": "The highlight of this resort is the restaurant.

I am originally from Puerto Rico and visit every year. We stay at a different hotel every time we visit. We are not extremely picky, but we like good service and a nice place. Like previous reviewers wrote, it is not so much of a resort as it is a nice hotel. However, they need to update certain areas. As far as the grounds, they were really nice and obviously well kept. Our room was nice. Please keep in mind when you visit, that the rooms do not have carpeting and the floor can get very cold when the AC is onl......which is on pretty much all the time since is very hot there. We hated the pool, although a nice pool, it was obvious that it needed a heavy cleaning. There were black spots of some kind of mold inside of it. After reading some of the most updated reviews here, I realized they must have cleaned it. I am glad they did because they have a beautiful setting. The beach is great and private. When we stayed at the hotel, there were hardly any people present and it felt like we had the pool to ourselves. I guess that is because August is not a very popular month to travel to a hot island. There were times when we were the only ones by the pool or beach. It was a very relaxing stay. If you are looking for excitement.....this is not the place for you!!! You will definetely need a car because there are really not many close places to eat at.....town is quite a few miles away. It is a very sleepy and quiet town.

We reserved a \"double queen\" ocean view room online for a 5-day stay. When we arrived to check in, they had put us in a tiny single-queen bedroom with a tiny balcony, with \"partial ocean view\". We immediately asked for at least a king bed, instead of a single queen. They put us into a very small king room that had a badly chipped and rusted bathtub (it turns out many of the rooms in the hotel have damaged / rusted bathtubs) and a vanity sink drain that drained very slowly. The front desk clerks (there were two on duty) were very busy talking amongst themselves, and sometimes seemed oblivious to the presence of customers waiting at the front desk. We had been traveling for most of a day to get there, and there was no help from the hotel for us to get our bags to our 4th floor room. They pointed us to a baggage cart (self service?) so we took our own bags to the room. I thought the lack of a porter / bellhop was out of place in a hotel that charges over $230.00 per night. At breakfast the first morning, which we had in the hotel's restaurant outdoor patio (nicer place to eat, but the crows will absolute bandits and we had to dodge bird \"droppings\"). The breakfast buffet, which cost almost $15.00 per person (before the hotel's obligatory 15% automatic tip added to the bill, but which also does not go to the servers, but rather to the restaurant) was pricey. It was nice, and they had good homemade pastries (some days, depending on which chef was working). The pool was beautiful. However, we were reluctant to swim in its water because the water appeared murky.. perhaps not so clean. There were dozens of people in the pool, including many small children, and adult patrons of the swim-up bar. The beach was beautiful, and the deck chairs were plentiful, as were the complimentary beach towels. The sun and temperatures were great for relaxing and we enjoyed many nice walks on the huge sandy beach. We ended up moving to a newer room the second day we were there, to the double-queen we were promised when we first made our reservation. We had a rental car, so we drove to the Puntas section of Rincon and had several great meals at the local restaurants on the surfing beach side of Rincon. Two great little restaurants were the tapas bar at Casa Islena, and The Rum Shack and Smiling Joes restaurants at The Lazy Parrot Inn on highway 413. We would rate those restaurants right up there with any we've eaten at in our many travels. Some of the winding roads and beautiful views of the ocean made for exciting sight seeing opportunities. Rincon is a great place to go for a slower pace of life than the metro area of San Juan. Be ready for very narrow serpentine steep roads which the locals hog and always seem to blare their high beams.

When we arrived at the resort it looked charming and inviting. The staff greeted us warmly and we felt like things were off to a good start. After checking in we went to our room. It had a partial ocean view and a view of the pool. Not bad so far. After pulling back the covers on the bed, I was horrified to see hundreds of crawling small insects. I am not sure what kind of insect(s) they were. I mentioned it to my husband and he didn't make a fuss and neither of us told the hotel staff. Probably should have. We tried to go forward and both of us were ready to relax after being in a hot car most of the day. We immediately changed and hit the beach!! We swam in the ocean then took a 2 hour stroll on the beach. There were several beautiful flowering plants along the rocky cliffs of the beach and several bees buzzing on the flowers. We noticed that there were also several bees on the sand too. My husband stepped onto a bee and got stung but was alright. I didn't get stung by any bees. But later something crazy happened!! After taking a stroll on the beach the sun was starting to set and we decided to get into the hotel hot tub. It felt wonderful. Afterwards we headed up to our room, showered and prepared for dinner at the hotel restaurant. While I was getting ready and dressed, I felt nauseous and dizzy and was contemplating telling my husband I couldn't make it to dinner. But I didn't want to spoil the beautiful evening so I kept getting ready. We both went to dinner and 10 minutes after we sat down I blacked out for about 15 seconds then I couldn't br eathe. I didn't even have a chance to eat anything yet. The food looked like it would have been delicious!! I told my husband and the waiter that something was wrong with me. My condition got worse and an ambulance was called. A gentleman of the wait staff comforted me while my husband ran to our room to try and find one of my benadryl capsules. The ambulance took forever and my heart was pounding and my body had tremors all over. I felt like I was dying. My husband and the gentleman decided to rush me to the hospital because the ambulance was nowhere in sight. We arrived at the emergency entrance and I fainted into my husbands arms. I was admitted to the emergency room and the doctor said I almost died. They didn't know what caused the episode but pumped me full of liquid benedryl, etc. Our entire stay in Puerto Rico was great until we got to Rincon. What caused this left us both baffled. Could it have been something at the hotel? The hot tub? Ocean? Beach? I am very hesitant to go back to that particular locale but I still enjoy Puerto Rico. Overall we had a nice time.

I (we?) couldn't have been happier!! I would have given this hotel my highest rating but for a couple of very minor things. What are those minor things? 1. Coffee in the a.m.-- There are no coffee makers in the rooms and no coffee service in the courtyard or lobby. You must ask a waiter in the restaurant for a cup, and it's a small one at that. 2. If you're like me and love to have breakfast on the beach in the open air, you ain't gonna get it. Breakfast is only served indoors in the courtyard restaurant. (OK, so they have a small patio ajoining the restaurant, but I'm partial to crashing waves with my croissants). 3. Ice machines are not located on every floor. OK, condemn me for being an American, but I gots to have my ice....lots of it..... and close by. That's all I can think of for the \"bad things\" After organizing trips with my friends over the last 10 years, I can't think of a more wonderful and stress free hotel experience. Witness this testimony. I've never written one of these reviews before!!! On the first night of our arrival, no restaurant in town could handle us with such short notice so we decided to do dinner in the hotel restaurant (\"Brasas\" I think it's called). Since there were so many of us with such different tastes, we ordered just about everything on the menu. It was all good to excellent. I think the skirt steak and the scallops with \"brown sauce\" were the best. The staff was very friendly and helpful: especially Borja at the front desk, Dennis at the pool bar, and \"Eddie\" aka Jessica at the lobby bar. If you decide to stay there, tell \"Eddie\" that \"Brittany\" says \"HI!!\" She loves to be called Eddie. The pool was kept immaculately clean....even despite the weekend traffic....and the jacuzzi was the perfect temp. The grounds were kept very clean. I loved the beds. Etc. Etc.

The hotel was a little hard to find traveling at night, but after we missed our turn we just turned around and eventually found it. The hotel is actually located in a town called Anasco, which is on the town line border with Rincon. The hotel has a security guard on duty at all times and we always felt very safe our entire time at the hotel. The staff is very friendly and they all speak English well. The hotel room was nice and big with 2 queen beds, cable TV and a little desk. The air conditioning really gets the room cool in a hurry. You can also purchase movies on the TV. The hotel restaurant is great for breakfast. The buffet is excellent. The service is also very good and the prices are just right. For lunch the poolside snack bar has burgers and hot dogs and chicken fingers and stuff. For dinner I would suggest you take a quick drive to Rincon and eat anywhere along the road. Just take a left out of the hotel gate and there are many places on the left side of the road that we stopped at that wee great. If you are craving Mc Donald\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s or Burger King or Subway just keep heading down the road through Rincon and you will find them. If you are looking for a market there is a small one that has al the basics like milk, bread, diapers and such down the road to the right. There is also a dollar store they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re as well. If you want to go shopping or want to gamble, take a right out of the hotel gate and head towards Mayaguez. There is a great casino/hotel on the left about 5 miles down the road. There is also a bunch of shopping centers on the right. Rincon Beach Resort has an awesome pool and a fantastic beach area with lots of space and coconut trees. Although no beaches in Puerto Rico are private beaches because of laws saying so, this one is private because it is surrounded by hills and mountains on both sides making it impossible for locals to travel through. I love the fact that the hotel as an open courtyard with lots of couches and chairs that you can sit and relax and order a drink and browse the Internet with their free wireless wifi. The only complaint I would have is that there is no room service. The only other hotel in the Rincon area that is better then this one is the Horned Dorset Primavera.

They were doing some renovating, which did disturb our midday nap around late afternoon, but I guess since it was the low season and they don't want to close down to complete all renovations, this was the best time to do it. The front desk was great. Omar gave us great suggestions on where to dine outside of their resort. They did not force us to stay and use their restaurant, which I thought was great customer service. Check in and check out was a breeze. Internet service was located in the lobby/bar area only. They had live entertainment (salsa) until about 11pm. Overall, a great experience.

If you are looking for tons of stuff to do, this might not be the place for you.

Also, if you exit 115 to your left from the resort, there is a place on your left called Panaderia, which had some yummy breakfast.

Because of that lack of development, despite the fact we were there in high season, we never felt crowded. The water is calm and there is no sea grass or rock to encounter. The resort offers an ample number of lounge chairs - both at the pool area and at the beach. There is never any need to race out first thing in the morning to \"claim\" a chair and some space. And there is sufficient shade from beach palms to provide cover for even the most sun-adverse. The resort itself had only one observable flaw - it lacks sufficient dining options. There is a sit-down restaurant offering breakfast and dinner, and a pool-area snack bar offering lunch. You would need deep pockets to consistently eat all dinners there as the lowest priced entree on the menu is $19 and there aren't any kid-friendly options on it. The breakfasts are much more reasonable - especially if you order off the menu (the $12 buffet seemed a little pricey). My family gave eight thumbs up to the panini-style breakfast sandwich of egg, ham and cheese. It was served with breakfast potatoes and was more than enough to feed two. The snack bar food was adequate but I recommend you stay away from the burger. It reminded me of the mystery meat from my high school cafeteria. The mahi-mahi wrap was good and the appetizer samplers were fine as well. There are other dining options in the local area but, aside of Taino International Coffee on 115 (open for breakfast, lunch AND dinner) and the Rum Shack on 413 - which are both great options - we didn't spend much time in them.

Give me a comfortable place to sleep that's free of lots of noise and bugs, and I'm fine. However, traveling with my wife and toddler changes things a bit...you need a hotel that can support your family's needs. The first night we arrived in ANASCO, not RINCON like the website and name of the resort imply, we were exhausted and just wanted to crash. Much to our dismay, the card for our room (the key) did not work. This should been a sign to leave immediately. After a few attempts and a new card, we were able to enter the room. The next day, we had to exchange cards about 5 times, the next day another 5 times and we started to complain, the next day we were so infuriated I actually had to raise my voice with the front desk in order for them to help out with the situation. To boot, the bathtub in our room would not fill up with water to give our daughter a bath. Rather than just change the room and throw us something for our troubles after the first 3 days of complaining, they played games with us \"we'll have our repair man see to it, etc\". Finally, I told the front desk that we NEED another room and that we need to be compensated for our headache. Our room was changed, but not ONCE did ANYONE offer to help us move all of our stuff (we had to move to a totally new building, mind you). After lugging all of our stuff to the new room, the DOOR STILL DID NOT OPEN. After arguing with the front desk and the repair guy again, we were allowed access to the adjoining suite next to our room. The lock on the suite door worked for the reminder of the stay and everything was fine. We were comped a free night, and we had use of the suite for th remainder of the trip. All of these problems could have been avoided and the hotel wouldn't have had to comp me anything if: the front desk gave us another room right from the start and did not play games with us. Another thing that could have helped would have been some common courtesy (ie help us move all our crap while moving to another room).

The restaurant on site was pricey but well worth it (just be sure to order off the menu and avoid the buffet). The photos you see at the Rincon Beach website are accurate as far as the pool, the views, and the outside areas of the property. The inside of our guest room was not as cute as their website would lead you to expect, but it was fine. The price was right, and the free parking was appreciated after having stayed in San Juan for a few nights. The beach was clean and safe. Be sure to rent a car as you're not within walking distance of anything. The only thing that disappointed us was that we paid extra for an oceanview room, but our room was tucked back in a corner with only a glimpse of the water. We were ok with that, because we didn't spend much time in the room anyway, but if the view is important to you, be sure to ask which way your balcony faces.

There is a poolside bar (although drinks are pricey, as in alot of the resorts) there was always a bartender at the poolside bar unlike other reviewers mentioned and there were always fresh towels. Although the only restaurant is also a bit pricey, (around $14.00 p/p for breakfast, how much can you eat that early??) there are many restaurants on the same road as the resort that you may enjoy. There are various hotels and other resorts very close by that you may go to and enjoy there restaurants. Also you have all the fast food restaurants available at a 15 min drive. There were activities for the kids water games for my 11 year old, volleyball games for my 14 year old, also kayaking and boat games for all of us. All free since it was a holiday weekend I assume, prices are usually around $20.00 p/hr for kayaking and pedaled boots. Yes there were alot of children in the pool but normal in any family setting (unless you go to a no childrens allowed resort like horned dorset) there will be children.

I was scared away by some of the reviews I read before our trip so I shortened our stay there and booked another hotel down the beach (which I HATED and we only stayed there for 1 night before we found another hotel to stay at) BIG MISTAKE we should have just stayed here. We went as a family of 4 (4 year old and a 2 year old) so we weren't expecting a 5 star hotel or 5 star service. We shopped around for prices online and found a good deal on a discount site. Our room was nice, a typical hotel room 2 queen beds, cable tv, balcony, bathroom. Our room was cleaned every day, we had fresh towels if we didn't hang them up. There is a sign in the bathroom that says they conserve water so if you hang your towels up they will assume you don't want fresh ones, so be sure to put your towels in a pile in the bathroom if you would like new ones every day. As far as food goes, we ate breakfast there on our first morning, it was a decent meal, and we ordered food for the two of us after the kids went to bed one other night. The only draw back to that is there is no room service and we had to walk down to the resturant to order, then they call your room when it's ready and you walk back. The food was good, a little on the expensive side. We were there to visit family so we at out or at our family's house most of the time. The playground was the best attraction for my 2 children. They could have spent all day there. The pool was nice, it was clean the 3 days we stayed so we have no complaints there and the pool bar was open and staffed but we were there on a weekend so I'm not sure about a weekday. They give you towel cards that you have to redeem at the gift shop for beach towels. You bring the towel back there and receive new ones when ever you want. The \"gift shop\" isn't much at all. Just a few hats, t-shirts (kids sizes only) and some beach toys. Because we stayed over the Easter holiday there was activities planned for the children. They had an easter egg hunt on the playground which they seperated into age groups, and the \"easter bunny\" left a surprise outside our door in the morning.

The room was cleaned nicely everyday. The room was relatively small for a hotel of this size and appearance but acceptable. The main problem at this resort is the lack of management attention to major resort features. The pool and whirlpool/jacuzzi were fine for the first three days, but appeared not to be cleaned for our final four days. It had alot of sand and dead bugs, but most of all was cloudy and obviously unsanitized. We had to take my wife to see a doctor who determined that she had an infection probably from the water quality in jacuzzi/whirlpool which required antibiotic treatment. During the week, staff coverage at the swim up bar was non-existent or only upon request. One day we were told that the person responsible for signing out/renting the small boats was not in and no one else could help us. In addition and contrary to prior reviews here, the ability to upgrade seems to have ended. The hotel was not full during the week and staff emphatically said they did not have any other rooms for us because they were booked (where were the people), maybe because we booked their lowest internet rate? The staff never informed us of a wedding reception on a Saturday evening until the night before. Not an entirely big deal, but would have been a nice touch to offer some courtesy to guests rather than directing them to stay away from the open courtyard and telling us what hotel amenities would not be available for us. The gated entrance feature is nice, but there is no guard during daylight hours and anyone can drive in with the open gate....seems very apparent that alot of people do during the weekend and use the facilities for free. The beach is nice, but the actual body of water is the Anasco Bay, which is calmer than the open ocean in Rincon, but it suffers from a high degree of algae (was told by a local) and also from some residual pollution from the nearby port of Mayaguez. The water is not dirty, but if you are looking for blue or turquoise water, this is not it. Would recommend spending more to stay at one of the finer places in San Juan or paying less and staying at a Parador, a local group of Puerto Rican style hotels throughout the island, such as near Boqueron and using some of the true south facing Caribbean beaches.

Though I have stayed at nicer places, it minimally met my expectations. I think it would for other folks too if you consider some of the following: 1) This place is not for everybody. If you're young and want to be closer to night life, consider staying in Rincon proper. The resort, as their posted address indicates, is in Anasco (really not very far from the action (10-20 minute drive from most of the Rincon attractions and services)). If you have a family (particularly teenagers) there is not a lot to do for them (kayak rentals - $20/hour, pool, a very warm but not hot tub, 2 computers with internet (and viruses), a ping pong table, beautiful beach). While these amenities may be enough for adults looking to do little or nothing for a few days, they hardly hold the attention of teenagers for very long. If you need to rely on their \"full service business center,\"...don't. This consists of two computers with viruses, only one computer is attached to an old multi-function printer that I could not get to work (neither could the staff, but I clearly knew more than they did). In addition, cell phone service for Nextel and Verizon seem pretty hit or miss at the resort itself. I was only able to get choppy reception with Verizon, some people we met got lousy reception with Nextel. 2) This place is for mainly couples who are looking to do little on site at the resort but relax at the pool or on the beach (very clean beach, beautiful sunsets). (though you can drive to play tennis or golf, or go diving, or go sight-seeing) 3) Strengths of the Resort. a) The food is mostly above average (to give a frame of reference: we styed at a Sheraton in Kauai that served pretty much cafeteria (average to below average) food). Some dishes are excellent (steak tips appetizer available at the lobby bar). But squeaky door at Las Brassas Restaurant works your nerves quickly. b) Very good assortment of quality wine is offered (at hotel prices). Their house wine is a good quality Mondavi (merlot, cab, or chard). While highly slurpable, this is the only wine offered \"by the glass.\" c) Beautiful Location, but landscaping could use some more attention and if you're on the first floor, sprinklers will soak your entire patio starting around 11 PM. d) Mixed drinks seem to be pretty good even at the pool bar (not watered down..interesting tropical mixes). e) Food prices seemed pretty reasonable compared to other hotels I have stayed at. 4) Weaknesses of the Resort. a) Service is a mixed bag of tricks. I found some of the managers to be very accommodating and would go out of their way to help. Some seemed to have \"it's not my job\" attitude. Some of the service staff (particularly a couple of the bartenders) are easy to offend and have some attitude. In general, some of the service staff seem to take offense at being treated as servants and feel entitled to be spoken to as equals. If you are able to take the \"you catch more flies with honey\" approach, you will probably not have a problem. Nevertheless, the hotel should do more customer service training with these folks. b) The rooms are adequate, bed was decent, but have stayed in greater luxury. ( We stayed in a king bed superior garden view room $165/night at [----------------] website). c) Maintenance is uneven. While the pool is skimmed daily for debris and bugs, the tiles around the top of the water could use a good scrub. Some peeling paint on one building, as others have said some missing tiles, but overall very clean. 5. Value: If you're paying $400/night for this place I would say use it elsewhere where you will get $400/night service and accomodations. We paid $165/night and found that we got what we paid for becuase other resort type places were charging much higher prices (Hyatt Dorado for example). If you can get a room in the range of $150-$230/night, it's probably an all right value. I was looking for a place with good food, decent wine, a decent pool (with bar), an adequate room and a good beach...all for rest and relaxation, very little activity. For the price we paid, we got it. 6. If you decide to stay at Rincon Beach Resort...there are a few good places to eat off-site. A must try place is \"Smilin' Joe's\" at the Lazy Parrott Inn on Rte 413 in Rincon (not too far from the Lighthouse, but is on a different road). Excellent food and service. Of notable surprise on the menu was some authentic Thai food (chicken satay and shrimp pad thai). Excellent peanut sauce. Many other different kinds of foods to choose from.

We spent 6 nights at the Rincon Beach Resort. All in all, we were very pleased with this hotel/resort. We do not like big resorts and this one felt relatively small and contained. We were there during President's week, the hotel was full, and yet it never felt overrun or frenzied. First of all, their beach is fantastic. The sea is calm and warm, great for swimming and floating. (If you prefer waves, go to northern Rincon.) The beach right in front of the hotel is kept very clean and has lots of lounge chairs. They even cleaned the ocean floor of rocks in that area. If you want some privacy, you can walk 2 minutes to either side and be alone. The view is great, nice crescent shape, and the sunsets truly spectacular. You can have a drink and watch the sun go down and color the clouds. The courtyard is also very beautiful, and well laid-out. It has pretty landscaping and birds are singing. There is a giant chess game you can play. We never ate at the hotel restaurant, since we prefer simple local foods rather than international cuisine. We did have a sandwich at the beach bistro, which was good. The pool is pretty but full of kids. In a way that's good since that kept the beach area quiet. Again, we were there during a school vacation so this was probably the worst case scenario. Our room was great. We got upgraded from a deluxe to a one bedroom suite (not sure why but perhaps because we booked through a travel agent), so we had a nicely decorated living/dining area and kitchen with all the basic necessities. The bedroom was nicely furnished too. It had a little balcony (the view from our balcony was not that great, just partial ocean, the rest residential buildings on the property). Bathroom was fine. Small hings we didn't like (minor annoyances): There were only 3 hangers in the closet and when we asked for more they didn't have any. Extra pillows were also not available. The printer in the computer room was not working. (However, they let me use the computer in their office to print out our boarding passes.) They charge for tv or even the satellite music channels. Only one station was free access. On the upside, they had a lot of pay per view movies to choose from. And finally, you could hear some traffice on route 115 in our room. It's not a big road (two lanes) but it is the main road into town and so it is busy. In some rooms right on the beach perhaps you wouldn't hear it. The service was friendly, the room and bathroom were very clean every day, but they don't do your dishes. The staff at the front desk was helpful and suggested a good local restaurant. Their snorkeling/diving and other trip operator is no longer in business though so although they have some flyers of other operators, none are affiliated with the hotel (even though they are still listed in the services book in the room). The location is good and easy to get to, about 30 to 45 mins from Aguadilla airport. You will need a car as there is nothing in walking distance of the hotel. Rincon is a short drive away.

This is important to note for those who seek the watersport adventures, diving, surfing, and nightlife experience that Rincon has to offer because the resort is a good 20-25 minutes away from all the action. There is not much around to do, or eat, because of its seclusion, and you have to definately drive everywhere. The resort is beautiful and very very clean. This is a major plus. The grounds are kept immaculate and it has security. However, it's a shame that their service is not to please the tourist.

NO KETCHUP in the whole entire resort. We asked for it for the fries and they looked at us like we were from another planet. My father had a splitting headache from laying too much out in the sun and I went to ask front desk to open the giftshop and sell me a tylenol. This was around 5pm. Their response was the girl that runs the shop went home already and she has the keys. No one else, not even the manager had the keys to open the shop and the front desk could not do anything about it. I had to call a friend who lives 25 min away to bring us Tylenols to the complex. Is that incredible or what, this is 2006 people!!! Another major no no for this resort is their food. The only restaurant they have, not cheap may I add, has so so food. And given that everything else is so far away if you are the type of traveler that does not like to go out of the resort wandering, you are stuck with this restaurant and their strick serving schedules. Beautiful POOL AND TIKKI BAR, no one ever there to take drink orders. THIS IS INCREDIBLE. Such a shame. They need to hire a barmaid, or bartender for the pool bar to be there from at least 11am to 4pm. You cannot get any drinks anywhere because the lobby bar does not open til the evening. RINCON BEACH RESORT please pay attention, this is for your own good I am writing this. You have a great place but you do not provide the services that go along with such a complex.

Only binoculars made this a partial oceanview and the desk clerk calimed that the only rooms with an ideal oceanview were the junior suites which is not accurate according to the website. If so, what exactly is a deluxe oceanview room? We decided to give the only restaurant in the resort a try. It took me 3 tries to get a drink and someone over to take our order. Once we did place our order we sat there for a little over an hour until I decided to get up and inquire about our food, meanwhile other people who came in after us were almost on dessert. Not to be rude , but these people were spanish speaking and I think this had something to do with our lack of service. All in all, waiters and hostesses were rude and unattentive, some desk clerks were helpful, just a disappointing experience.

The pool was very nice, however if you don't like children I would not recommend this resort. I happen to like children, but they were everywhere--jumping in and out of the hot tub, pool, etc. Just not a couples place. My major complaint was that the bathtub in our room was broken (the drain would not retain water), and the staff wasn't the best at responding the situation. They said it would be fixed by morning, but it was not. Again they sent someone up again the next day and we were finally told that it was unfixable. Okay. So we asked if there was another room and were told that the other available room also had a broken bathtub. Also, there were two more slight problems. When we arrived, I pulled down the covers to go to bed and there was a large stain (hopefully a water stain?!) on the sheets--though they did look pressed and clean otherwise. They did send someone to change them immediately. Lastly the hot water in the shower was not too consistant. So, overall it was nice, but a bit inconsistant in the quality.

The lobby is filled with nice furniture arrangements to mingle with guests, sit alone or sit at the bar.

There's plenty of lounge chairs to go around too which is nice.

But the pool and poolside bar were enough for our short stay. The staff doesn't do a good enough job of keeping the pool clean on a daily basis. There are several big trees near the pool that during this time of year are pollinating and their little flowers end up in the pool. The poolside bar is very convenient. The resort layout is fantastic. It has an ample courtyard in the middle surrounded by the guest room towers (just 6 floors high). Not all the towers have ocean views but the ones that do have are premium. The rooms are confortable and very nicely decorated. Ours was a little musty smelling and the bed comforter needed replacement. Some dust from the ceiling stucco had fallen on top of the bed when we arrived, probably due to filtration problems. The bathroom was quite large for a hotel but the shower head and water pressure were horrendous. Otherwise, very clean and well put. The landscaping on the grounds is well kept and gives the resort a nice laid back feel. The trees on the courtyard are healthy and when in bloom look fabulous.

It gives you a sense of place as soon as you get there. The lobby is open and has a small bar for a mid afternoon drink or post meal cocktail. We only had breakfast at the restaurant but although pricey, the food is very good and plenty. Their dinner menu is mostly meats and is supposedly real good.

I had read all previous reviews and couldn't decide between this property and Rincon of the Seas, but the fact the RBR had refrigerators tipped the scales for us, with three children, ages 8, 3, and 1. This is a prime beach location, with the beach only steps away from any of the rooms, and the infinity pool very conveniently located at the edge of the sand, with a boardwalk separating the pool and beach. The water in the sea was calm and warm, and the pool and hot tub were ideally situated. Despite the holiday weekend, we felt that it was not very crowded. We were able to reserve shaded beach chairs both on the boardwalk (next to the pool) and on the beach itself, near the water. By Sunday afternoon, we felt like we were the only ones there--in fact there were only eight cars in the parking lot! For families, the location is ideal--the restaurant was rather pricey and too formal for our active kids, so we got up early the first day and drove into Rincon on Route 115 to a grocery store and bought provisions for all of our breakfasts and snacks (hence the necessity of a refrigerator). After a full day at the pool/beach, we ventured out toward Mayaguez on Route 115 and then Route 2 and found a shopping plaza with several restaurants and fast food chains. If we had stayed longer we might have tried Brasas, the onsite restaurant, which also had a children's menu with at least five different items at $6.95 each. The resort caters to couples and families alike, and we felt that the staff was friendly and quite accomodating. Small inconveniences about the room were quickly remedied, and the ocean view room with balcony came with a stunning view. The room was clean and smelled clean as well. One downside was the fact that on Monday morning there was no water, as the reserve tanks were empty, and we had to wait until noon for reserve water trucks to arrive from San Juan. For a quiet, relaxing, stunning beach location, consider this property. Do note that there is no shopping in the immediate area--we weren't able to purchase any souvenirs at all until we went to the airport. I would consider a car a must for this location.
