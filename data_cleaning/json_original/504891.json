I'm a pretty easy going guy but on the way from the airport, when the taxi driver asked me where I was staying and I told him, he proceeded to ask if I like Vietnamese girls.??? Right there and then, I knew this hotel was going to be questionable. Hotel 81 is apparently located right off of Singapore's biggest red light district, Geylang rd. In my opinion, Singapore's red light district is pretty tame by North American standards but it gets very loud with KTV bars and restaurants open until the wee hours of the night so it was difficult for me to get good sleep. On top of that, people kept going in and out throughout the night slamming the door making it even more difficult for me to sleep. Other reviews mentioned prostitues frequent the hotel often, so maybe that's where my taxi driver was getting at. The rooms are small, but tolerable if you are travelling alone. Some rooms do not have windows but mine did. But you can't open them. The bed was alright but it had quite a bit of ants on it and that frustrated me. The sheets were dirty too. The bathroom and shower are adequate. Kettle and tea provided. The staff was rude and not helpful at all. There are a lot of good cheap halal restaurants nearby as well as some markets for shopping so that was a plus. However, the nearest MRT station, Paya Lebar, is a 15 min walk which is quite far. All in all, staying at this hotel is not a recommended choice of mine.", "Date": "March 13, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "moscow", "Title": "\u201cThe worst hotel I\u2019ve ever been\u201d", "Author": "vilen", "ReviewID": "UR125734810", "Content": "Absolutely garbage!

I guess the only things that matter to them was collecting the money and nothing else does matter for them. No correct information even for the hotel location and transportation ! We took Budget shuttle bus from the airport for SG$9 but since the hotel is so closed in return to Changi Airport we tool taxi for two of us around SG$12. The hotel does not have any idea about budget shuttle bus in my surprise ! Distance to MRT station: The MRT station is not close to this hotel it will take around half an hrs walking distance from Paya lebar station which was told us it is the nearest station, it is more convenient to take a taxi. After complaining to the staff they did not accept and to my surprise they told us it will take 10 mins walking !! In the second time complaining they told us the nearest station is Eunos !! not Paya Lebar !! Hotel Negihborhood : once we start walking at night with my friend and find out that the neighborhood which is Geylang is Red light area. I also heard from local people that some hotel around this area will give the rooms for rent for few hrs basis which is obviously clear what is the reason ! Small Room and No internet Facility: The lunge is old and smelly and the corridor is the same, room is small and no internet facility available in this hotel ! I do not recommend this hotel and this neighborhood specially if this is your first visit of Singapore, it makes a bad impression on you.", "Date": "April 15, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Singapore, Singapore", "Title": "\u201cOh no.... never again\u201d", "Author": "Gev-Sar", "ReviewID": "UR26154418", "Content": "It's hard to remember... but it is better to share my bad luck experience, so nobody will suffer it as I did...
