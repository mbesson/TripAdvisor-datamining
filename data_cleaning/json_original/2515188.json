The first time with my husband and our 2 daughters so we took 2 rooms (suite and deluxe room) When we arrive we saw immediately high security in the building. Mr. Netanyahu was also staying in the hotel. Lots of heavily armed man in our hallway. When my daughter opened her window a sniper on the roof aimed with a riffle at her. We reported this to the front desk and tried to stay relaxed about it. but I must say that it has surprised me that the hotel did not apologies to its guests because the atmosphere was not nice. 5 weeks later I booked this hotel again for a city trip with my daughter I had booked deluxe room but received the smallest room in the hotel. Complaining did not help. Maybe I should have made a big issue out of it. But that is not my style. I am going to Paris next month and although this hotel is very lovely and briljantly decorated, I do not think with these experiences I will book this hotel again.

This hotel is typically Parisian, and although in many ways traditional, it is also very modern. Modern art adornes the walls, and the rooms, have paintings and other object d'art in the rooms, making them less like hotel bedrooms, and more like staying a a friends extremely luxurious Parisian house. The bar is trendy but still traditional at the same time, with an amazing, and changeable cocktail list. There is a smoking room, so no standing outside in the cold and rain, it was very cold when I was there!! Both the restaurants are excellent, the French restaurant has a fabulous menu, and the staff, although incredibly knowledgeable, are also very relaxed and friendly, so you do not feel overwelmed by the staff who are assisting you.

Welcome at entry is inviting, polished and professional complete with the doormen who both look and act the part as professional welcomers/helpers with heart. Kudos to the team at the front - (and those that hired and trained them). Our welcome by the front reception was again polished and efficient. Every time we came down, we were greeted with a smile and a genuine good attitude. Breakfast in the restaurant was always lovely though we often ordered croissants (requested them to be warm) with our morning coffees to our room. They arrived warm and were so good. One day they were very late and when finally delivered, they apologized and said it was on the house. I didn't even say anything and they were proactive to assuage the situation. Kudos again to them! Again, the staff (sorry i forgot all the names...the young man who checked us in whose name begins with a G, and the lovely young woman who must be part Japanese and French were a few of the folks who stood out but all were good...and the kind doorman with the long eyelashes). Re: service: I had forgotten my hair curling iron and was told they could bring me one. This did not happen and i was encouraged to visit Sephora for one...they don't carry them. My mistake for not bringing it but it is always a plus when high end hotels carry some extras. They did manage to find a great hair stylist to come to my room, Samira - she was lovely (pricey). Concierge was fine. I asked for a print out of some specific restaurants one morning hoping it woudl be in my room that evening...but no luck. That said, they may have expected me to pop down again for the information but we were just too busy. Okay the hotel...let's start with the bedrooms. We had a great room towards the end on the 4th or 5th floor - possibly 511. Nice layout. Enjoyed the big mirrors and tv's hidden in the mirrors in front of the bed and behind it too. The murano like lights in the room were fun as were the desks with the maps of Paris marked up as if by a friend inviting you to explore the city were great. The bathroom was all mirror...wow. At first a bit overwhelming, but clean, crisp and fun. I had to use one of the sinks to lay out my make up as not enought room to spread out one's toiletries. Yet, with a washcloth laid out on one of the two flat sinks, it worked well. Bring your own lotion as Stark does not believe in lotion at hotel. , i was told. The hotel did provide me some upon request, but it was i think from the spa or a local store. That said, the bath oils and packaging of their toiletries were lovely. The only odd thing in the room was the picture of fruit, but i suppose that is a matter of taste. Overall, the hotel is modern yet you still very much felt you were in Paris! As many of you know, when designers go modern they sometimes seem to want you to forget where you are, but not Stark on this project - good job on this! (and i am not a huge Stark fan so this compliment comes from my experience at the hotel not from getting caught up in his reputation). The hotel lobby bar area is quite convenient - you can have good conversations (not too noisy and feels private enough) and yet still enjoy some good people watching. The choice of putting the books up high is interesting. The people at the hotel when we were there appeared to include a crown prince from Asia, ministers from the Gulf, and other interesting whose who...of a whose who who were not too flashy...just interesting and chic. It was a real treat to enjoy the newly unveiled Le Royal Monceau - Raffles and Stark got it right! Oh and did i mention the beds and bedding....ahhh divine. Loved the mattresses, bedding, pillows, slippers and robes, and the views to the courtyard below and greens on the terraces above...and the windows opened out onto this lovely area...so fresh air could be let in without any noise issues. Yes, the beds just made me want to dive into them - making the Parisian night special all the way through til morning. Merci! And the location is just fine...close enough to walk up the Arc de Triumph and down the famous boulevard. And if you want some restaurant ideas....oh i have many...including just go to St Germaine and wander...find an older restaurant with lots of people inside and enjoy. There are so many great culinary experiences including the new Akrame, opened about 3 months ago. low key place but chfe is talk of town...ex gagnaire/el bulli but very much his own style.

( i was texting my wife so i had an exact timing) to give an example an american staying with his wife arrived at the bar at 1h10 and was told the bar was closing at 1h30. they brought them menus at 1h20, took the order at 1h30. the guy asked for a nice single malt whisky. nobody in the staff had any clue. they showed him in the end the most expensive (\"very nice single malt, a bit oakey\" was the commentary they gave). i left at 1h50 and don't remember seeing a glass in his hand. and by the way the first time i went out pack in hand for a smoke the staff intercepted me and asked me if i was leaving (as in you forgot your bill). not very heartening. i went the next morning for breakfast with a friend who works nearby (i had booked a table the night before but not many people where there at 9h30. was very nicely welcomed and brought to a table, offered a glass of a fresh pressed juice of our choice and some very nice coffee.\u00a0 then we ordered continental breakfast with some boiled eggs on the side. eggs arrived first, perfectely cooked and presented they were delicious. but then again people were \"busy\" wisking around and after some time we managed to grab somebody to get us the bread and fruit salad (and again it took a while). his french was pretty limited. he asked us if we wanted more coffee and he had such a hard time understanding \"cafe au lait\" that we ended up asking for \"the SAME please\". i hate raising my voice but the guys were really useless. my friend was also really annoyed (and we are very laid back people so it takes a lot to get us to that level of annoyance) i returned to my room at 11 to find out that somebody had come and took the dirty towels and half the bed sheets and duvet cover. i was booked for one night only they have a log of this kind of stuff and they should know not to clean before check out. also i've never encountered a room half done before. either people are in there cleaning it or they are not doing it. i decided to leave right there as it felt of being told to go. in the end it was a pretty bad experience, completely sub standard, and also it's a very soulless hotel which made the experience a complete flop (i'm a contemporary art collector and was expecting a lot as it's the signature of the hotel). i have stayed in most 5 star hotels in paris and i know what one should expect for that level of price.", "Date": "June 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Campinas, SP", "Title": "\u201cRoyal Monceau - Raffles Paris is great, beautiful Palace!\u201d", "Author": "Nanda2011", "ReviewID": "UR99283459", "Content": "It is all about luxury from check-in to rooms furniture and restaurant.
