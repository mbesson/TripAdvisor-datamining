The hotel is extremely well situated less than 5 minutes, even with dragging heavy bags, from the train station. It is in a small side street which is quiet. Access to the vaporetto stops is also probably a 2-4 minute walk. To walk to where the airport vaporetto leaves and arrives is maybe a 7-10 minute walk. The breakfasts were perhaps not as plentiful as our previous stay, the coffee was still great. The kitchen staff are not quite grumpy. Check in was efficent, but not friendly, only Daniella really smiled out of the receptionists. The cleanliness of the room was good, not great. We stayed in the 'suite' this time, which is really two double rooms and bathroom. The bathroom was a lot better than the previous normal double bedroom and ensuite. The tiling was good, the fittings were exceptional. Water pressure in the shower not great, but no worse than you would expect in a similar hotel in Italy. There was quite a lot of noise from the passage inside the hotel, the sound proofing of this room was not great. But, if you are looking for a clean, well priced hotel, central to whatever you need in Venice, this is ideal. If you are looking for a more upmarket experience, perhaps something else is more suitable.

Also, although you are not staying in the most touristy area, the windows/walls are very thin and you can hear everything. You can hear people pulling their suticases on the street to their conversations. This was not the hotel's fault, but a property in the alley was doing construction the entire time we were there and we woke up to the sound of them working on the building promptly at 7am and they did not stop until dinner time. However, if the windows were more sound proof, this probably wouldn't have mattered. Service at the front desk was hit or miss. Two ladies were absolutely wonderful and so friendly. Another lady, not so much. You won't feel that special staying at this hotel. All of the other staff at the other hotels on our trip knew us by name and made us feel so welcome.

The hotel is only a few minutes walk from the bus station, (bussing is the easiest and least costly way to get from the airport) and even closer from the train station. There is a somewhat long bridge to navigate to get to the hotel. Even though this bridge is very new, it is in keeping with the accessibility very unfriendly nature of Venice, with no smooth side to easily pull a suitcase along, only steps. Watch for very aggressive locals wanting to carry your bags over the bridge. Stella Alpina is a hotel with a bit of a hostel feel to it. We had a room on the first floor (this is a four floor hotel with no elevator), which was not much bigger than the queen (maybe king) sized bed. But it was clean, comfortable and above all, air conditioned, with a sink in the room. Even though we shared a bathroom, and it was down the hallway, ours was only one of three units that did not have an ensuite, so access to the bathroom was never an issue. Plus, our room was the only one in this category that was air conditioned. The included breakfast was a hugely pleasing bonus, with yogourts, fresh croissants, ham, cereals and juices. Inexpensive internet access in the lobby. The hotel is very well situated, even though it is at one end of the island of Venice. The easy access to the bus and train stations (you can even walk to the cruise ship terminal) was really handy. And you have to be prepared to walk everywhere in Venice anyways. Be prepared to have nowhere to sit, since Venice does not have benches anywhere; be prepared to either pay to get into awful toilets or hold it in; be prepared for a complete lack of greenery; be prepared to be one of thousands upon thousands of tourists; be prepared for the hustle and bustle of terrific nightlife and people watching. There is good, cold water available in many spots from a fire hydrant type outlet. Wet your hat for a cooling relief for a few minutes. A highlight was the Biennale, a once every two years art festival (goes on for a few months). It is situated at the far end of Venice (from Stella Alpina) but in a parklike setting, which does not exist elsewhere in the city. Only place to have a picnic. Amazing how much cooler it was in the shade of the trees. If you are so inclined, go to a Shabbat service on Friday night (the Jewish quarter is a short walk from the hotel) and then rush over to the Gam Gam kosher restaurant and try to get into the free dinner hosted by Chabad. Super delicious with non stop singing. Venice is a fascinating city, not to be missed. 4 days was plenty of time, which included a full day at the Biennale.", "Date": "October 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Virginia Beach, Virginia", "Title": "\u201cNice Hotel, Great Location\u201d", "Author": "NelVB", "ReviewID": "UR118981069", "Content": "this is a no-frills, good find in beautiful, touristy Venice.

The breakfast was better than some in Europe, but appeared that they did not replenish items when they ran out. We had to check out very early and they sent us a bagged breakfast which was nice. The street (if you can call it that) in front of the hotel is extremely noisy and it was difficult to sleep.

I was very pleased with our decision to stay here! The hotel is SO close to the train station, which is so convenient. I can't imagine carting our luggage throughout Venice looking for a hotel in the city center. The staff was pretty friendly, not overly friendly, but definitely not rude either. Our room was very cute. It had a sink, a double bed -which was two twin beds pushed together (not the most romantic), a dresser and an armoire. It was clean except for the floor under the bed and in the corners. Every time something would get pushed under the bed, it would be covered in dust. Our floor was eerily quiet! I didn't hear or see another person during our stay. It was perfect because there are communal bathrooms and showers so there were no lines, and no waiting for the shower. Breakfast was really good and included in the stay!! There were croissants, rolls, butter, jam, nutella, cereal, teas, coffees, juices etc. It was definitely better than the breakfast served at most lower budget hotels and it was great to not have to go searching for food in the morning. There was a computer near the breakfast area but the staff said that the internet was down so nobody was allowed on it. I recommend going to eat at the restaurant \"Brek\" right down the street (within 2-3 min walking max)!! The food was not amazing but it was good and very cheap!! You can get a large carafe of wine for 3 euro! We ate here every night.

We couldn't have been happier. The staff was very helpful and friendly. On both occasions having arrived earlier than check-in they stored our luggage in a locked room as others have mentioned. The first time we could have taken a twin bed room that was ready, but we wanted a double bed, so upon return we then were given an upgrade to a junior suite (#6) with two rooms, ensuite bathroom, as it was not booked during our stay. How nice! It was on the street side and we loved watching the people go by and hearing the night sounds - everything reverberated off the walls, so maybe not good for light sleepers, but we were always tired enough we slept fine. It was just an incredible slice of Venice! Breakfast was perfect for us - juice, croissants, bread, etc. that meant we did not have to go looking for food and started us off on our day. Our last visit when we were checking out at 4:30 AM they gave us a packed breakfast to take the night before so we could actually pack it in our bags as we wanted. We were fortunate that our room the first time was on the 1st floor - not too difficult with our bags (I can see where having to go up higher would be difficult, but most hotels in Venice do not have elevators from what I understand) The second time we were on the ground floor facing the breakfast garden (#54). Both of these rooms were obviously newly rennovated and really above what we'd expected for a 2 star hotel. It could not have been more convenient to get to from P. Roma and we loved walking to the main attractions from there as it allowed us to get to know the city pretty well.

Hotel has excelent location. It is located very near to the train station (about 200m), but we didn't hear trains at all. We had room on the first floor with windows to garden. It was very quiet there and we didn't hear our neighbours. The only problem is that windows are very thin. It may be problem if you will be given the room with windows to street (althought street is small and not busy), but I am pretty sure that almost all hotels in Venice has thin windows. The breakfast was good. Room was clean and of medium size. Bathroom was of good size. Double bed was big and comfortable. Room had heater/airconditioner. Staff was very friendly and on our last day they allowed us to leave our bags in lockable hotel luggage room without any charge. If you are going to visit Venice, I suggest to stay there for at least 3 days in low or middle season and at least 4 days in high season. The 72h public transport ticket costs 33 EUR, but if you'r under 29yrs then you can buy Rolling Venice Card for 4 EUR and 72h public transport ticket at reduced price 18 EUR. With Rolling Venice Card you will get many other discounts at shops, hotels, museums, restaurants etc. If you will travel to other city by train, I suggest you to buy tickets at ticket machine (ticket machines doesn't give change), because at ticket office you will have to pay additional charge which may be as big as the price of the ticket.
