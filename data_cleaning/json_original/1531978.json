The rooms are huge, with a nice balcony with view on the golf course. It's very relaxing, immerse in a lush garden, with 3 good restaurants, a real and big supermarket open till 10 p.m., 3 fantastic swimming pools, one of them is olympic size. There is even a bowling alley, a very nice playground and even a kindergarden where you can drop your kid. It's very close to the zoo and 20 min. to Orchard street with MRT. I can't wait to return to Singapore to stay again in that beautiful resort.", "Date": "February 17, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Johor Bahru, Malaysia", "Title": "\u201cGood for relaxing\u201d", "Author": "chenyu11", "ReviewID": "UR122711341", "Content": "Stayed a night on 31/12/11 with family.

It's out of my expectation that the room is spacious and price are very reasonable among singapore hotels. The view from the room is good. Very silent and secure. I would definitely come back if I go to singapore again. One of the drawback is wifi is a payment service. I didn't spend any time on hotel area or hotel facilities.

It has beautiful recreational facilities including a world class 36 hole golf course, driving range, an olympic swimming pool and a resort and children's pool, a bowling alley, restaurants and a beautifully equipped gym and squash courts. The rooms are the largest you will find anywhere and are furnished beautifully. The only downside of this hotel are the breakfasts are third rate and internet access is around $10 per day depending on the length of your stay.

As what the previous chap had commented - there is nothing much to do here if you are not a golfer. There is a bowling alley in the hotel itself though. What we liked - 1. Rooms are amazing spacious 2. Great view of the golf course 3. Relaxing getaway What we didn't like - 1. The breakfast is poor by Singapore standards as a food paradise 2. No sheltered carparks, my car became a sauna and target practice for pigeons after a day's parking 3. Nothing to do there! 4. No internet in the rooms (or in the hotel at all)", "Date": "October 10, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Helsinki", "Title": "\u201cNothing to do around ...\u201d", "Author": "ThierryIT", "ReviewID": "UR71351745", "Content": "Hello, Can be a good hotel for very short / business trip, but not for holidays ....

Beautiful golf course, for people who play golf ... But as \"external client\" we don't have the right to walk around to the reservoir ... So what to do ?? Nothing ... If you want to go to the town center, you will have first to take the shuttle to the MRT ... Swimming pool are very good, there is one of 50 meters ... There is no very nice restaurant around, one chinese, but I was sick during the night, and the main hotel restaurant who is horrible.
