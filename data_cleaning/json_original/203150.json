The breakfast was not top-notch but enough to make you full and ready for the day! The hotel is 30min in bus from Termini station and 2 buses are needed. It is more difficult to reach the city center (i.e: Piazza Venezia) but for tourist with time ahead this is not a problem. Of course, for the tourist in a hurry I would not recommend this hotel.

The hotel is situated in a peaceful leafy suburb near the Villa Borghese (Rome's main park) and although out of the city of Rome, it still felt like you were not too far away from it as it was easy to get their by the trams and buses. First buy a travel pass (BTI - biglietto turistico integrato) from a local tabaconist (tabacchi) on your way to Viale Liegi (Ungheria) the nearest stop for number 19 tram and the number 3 bus into Rome (if you have the metro and tram map these routes are marked).

The front desk reminded me of a dark cold war hotel with two black and white flickering security camera televisions on the floor and a bank of boxes on the wall there room keys used to be stored. The back office was visible from the front reception area and I wish I could erase those memories from my head. When you get to the 4th or 5th floors, look up in the hallways and you will see that many of the ceiling tiles are nowhere to be found leaving holes to look up into the wiring and plumbing of the hotel. Oh, and the blue shag carpet with blue acrylic poles on the stairwells is classy - wish I had a photo. When we checked in we were given a room with two twin beds and not the room with a king bed as requested weeks in advance of arriving. Come to think of it, all of my email communications pre-trip went unanswered. The staff was very accommodating in changing our room to a room with a king bed. One thing that did catch my eye was the fact that each electronic room key cards have a sticker on it with your room number and are reused for the same room guest after guest. So much for the point that the card system was designed so if you should lose the card no one will know which room you are in. So if you ever get room 404 \u2013 I washed my hands before using the card\u2026 can\u2019t say that about anyone else using that card. We got into the room and were initially hit by a heat wave. One of those heat waves that takes the moisture right out of your eyes. The type where you can feel your face shrinking. I immediately found the thermostat, selected AC, and turned it to 5 C (was preset to 22 C). Nothing happened. No noise of a fan kicking on. It was at this stage that my fianc\u00e9e called me into the bathroom to inspect a pubic hair stuck on the backside of the door. Awesome. I opened the window and we decided to go into town to get some dinner as it had been a long day traveling from the US. Location \u2013 this place is far away from anything you might want to see if you are a tourist. I highly recommend staying somewhere else if location means anything to you. There are two tram (19 and 3) lines that can take you to a Metro stop (Policlinico \u2013 Blue line) and one bus (53) that can take you to either a Metro stop (Barberini \u2013 Red line) or close to the Spanish Steps. Note that bus line #53 does not run on public holidays or on Sundays \u2013 found that out the hard way. We took the bus to the Spanish Steps the first night and it took at least 30 minutes to get there. There is a great story about a bus driver shattering the glass partition with his elbow while arguing with a customer, but that is not related to the hotel. So we get back to the hotel (it is December and cold outside) and get to our room with the window open\u2026 and it is still pretty warm. I figure it only feels warm because we came in from the cold. Wrong. We spent the night with basically no sheets covering us with the window open sweating on the rock hard bed. I cannot underplay how much I was sweating all night long. I went to the front desk the next morning and made comments regarding how hot the room was and the front desk said they would send someone up to look into the problem. When we returned that evening the room was still blazing hot so I went back down to the front desk where I was told to turn off the heat\u2026. Ok. I withheld comments and calmly expressed that the heat was off and set to 5C but the room felt closer to 30C (Which is 86F and a bit of an exaggeration, but I was trying to make a point). The front desk guy said, \u201cThat is impossible\u201d. I still laugh at that exchange. So the guy came up to the room and looked at the thermostat and concluded it was off. And then he was off, leaving pretty quickly before I asked him how to raise the shutters to get more air in the room. He looked at me like I was an idiot and pressed a small button no larger than a square inch just to the right of the electrical outlet and the shutter started to open. Out went the helper. Nothing like having your window wide open all night long just to try and get the room bearable \u2013 \u201chello person across the alley, how are you tonight?\u201d Even with the window open and it being close to 5C outside, the sheet was more than enough\u2026 almost too much some nights as it was very hot in the room. When I asked the front desk if I could turn the AC on to cool them room I was told no, the AC does not work. Down at the bar one night I overheard another table talking about how hot his room was. I hope he found the switch to open the shutters. One more thing - there are a lot of tour groups that pass through here. The reception area can get very busy and the line for one of the two elevators can get very very long. Some positives \u2013 the bar was not overpriced compared to the rest of Rome. A bottle of decent red wine was only 20 Euros. The front desk did recommend a nice pizzeria for dinner and they also helped arrange a driver to take us to the airport. The driver turned out to be very nice and took us on a tour of the Roman highlights on the way to the airport (it was a fixed rate ride, so no extra distance fees).", "Date": "December 30, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "1", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Detroit, MI", "Title": "\u201cToo far from everything\u201d", "Author": "Aimen", "ReviewID": "UR47824416", "Content": "It was a 4 star hotel so had the frills but its too far from everything.

They had a great American style buffet breakfast with eggs cooked to order, meats, cereals, yogurts, fruits, juices, coffee, etc. The breakfast was $12 Euros, but hey, in Rome, for all-you-can-eat, that's a bargain. A two minute walk to a bus or tram stop will take you anywhere in the city you want to go.

They even gave us a surprise bottle of champagne for my fiance's birthday - and it was really good too!

We were given room 316. It was a passable 3 star with a few issues, but not a 4 star by any stretch of the imagination. The sheets were clean and the bathroom was nice, but thats all the good I can say about it. We had two beds shoved together even though we requested a king size bed. They did however make it up as one bed our second and third nights. The view was of a brick walled building across the alley. Our chair in the room looked like a used up lawn chair chipped and uncomfortable and the television set was tiny and the sound was permanently set so low you couldnt hear it unless you were 6 inches away from it.. When we requested a nicer room, we were just told we booked a standard room, so were only going to get a standard room. I'd say their standards for 4 star are extremely low.

He was the most arrogant person I've met at a hotel. He must have said a total of three words max to us. He took our passports, made copies, gave us our room key and off we were. I had to ask for breakfast hours, room type, wake up call, because he certainly wasn't sharing information. I think I was bothering him... Our room was small and stuffy. The remote control worked half the time, the TV had 5 channels. Since we hadn't taken any desert at the restaurant, we thought to go down and ask if we could have a little something sweet. I was shooed away as at 10pm, only drinks are served. I got in a fight with the bellman with the room temperature because the heat was on, it was 12 degrees outside and to the Romans, that's cold. It was hot in the room. We ended up sleeping with the window open and the heater on. Nice energy conservation eh! The worst thing was that you could hear the neighbours from the vent in the bathroom... and I mean, you could really hear everything! I was terrified! Can't even go to the bathroom without peace! For a four star hotel, it was horrifying! Thank god, we could close a door from the entrance/bathroom to the room itself, so it blocked out \"the noise\". On the up side, the breakfast was delicious and the morning staff friendly. Unlike the front desk guy, who happened to work every shift when we went by. On the last day, I requested help in securing a shuttle to take us back to the airport. I was told this was impossible and the only option was a private car for 60 euros. Words to the wise, book ahead, check the yellow pages/internet and book it yourself. We did that and it was 40 euros for a private car. All this to say... the hotel may be in a nice neighbourhood, but there is nothing else around. Pay more, stay closer. If you must stay in that area, avoid Borromini, check into Claridge. The rooms have flat screen TVs, the're bigger, cleaner and the bath has two jaccuzi showers. For the same price, the staff is friendly and you can have your breakfast served at your room at no extra cost. Also, they gave us a little \"cheat sheet\" to get around with the bus and street cars.

And - wow - what an amazing city!", "Date": "January 6, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Surrey", "Title": "\u201cOut of the way location\u201d", "Author": "Gerry0", "ReviewID": "UR4112609", "Content": "This hotel is truly 'average' and it is quite a long way out of Central Rome. The room that we booked was clean and pleasant with the added bonus of a private terrace. As you can see from the photo, this is not a Renaissance building as described on some site travel sites. To get into Rome's centre, you have a choice of trams (one goes to the South of the City Centre past the Colosseum and the other takes you to the north of the centre nearer to the Vatican). The tram is a very pleasant and more authentic way of travelling around and it is cheap. The other alternative is travelling in and out by taxi and that wasnt as expensive as we thought if you use it infrequently or late at night (about 10 euros one way). If you are looking for a hotel way out of the centre in a quiet suburb, this will be OK. Decor average, service average but quiet nights sleep.", "Date": "November 15, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bucharest", "Title": "\u201cNice and friendly people, esp. in restaurant\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4074940", "Content": "The hotel was excellent, rooms and breakfast food very good ... we spent an extended weekend and we enjoyed also a beautiful weather (25 Celsius degress end of October).
