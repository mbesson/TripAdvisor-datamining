The hotel is a lovely old building, with a tiny lift and a lounge on the mezzanine floor. The rooms are practical, clean, and fairly spartan. We had two rooms with 3 large beds in each. The bathrooms were clean and simple. The hotel management was very professional, and very helpful.

It is right next to the Campo de' Fiori which is a nice little market square with a number of bars and restaurants . Just around the corner is the Pantheon and walk a little further to most of the other Major sites. I was only on a 2 night stay with my Nephew and we had a 6 nations match (Italy v England) to fit in so we walked the sites in one morning in a circular route which captured Pantheon, 2 churches,Colosseum, The Roman Forum, Palazzo del Quirinale, Palatine, Circus Maximus, Trevi Fountain, Victor Emmanuel II Monument etc - all in one morning (we walked past the sites rather than hanging about taking a thousand photos like others seemed to be doing)!!. Couple of other plus points are the value for money and the helpfulness of the staff on the 24 hour reception. All spoke good English and when I left my phone in reception they saved it until I got back. Don\u2019t get me wrong the place is no palace and the rooms are basic with no breakfast facilitys but they were clean and the bathroom was spacious (as big as the twin room). We were staying in February and it was snowing but the rooms were kept warm by the central heating system - if anything slightly to warm but since it was absolutely freezing out I didn\u2019t mind that our room was the warmest place in Rome!! The only negative was the smell when entering the room - bad plumbing! This soon Dissipated as we let some fresh air in and ran the shower. Would recomend purely on location alone as in the day we were busy and at night the atmosphere was good in the square even though it was snowing and a lot quieter than normal (apparently). The Drunken Ship gets lively after 22:00 and was giving plenty of good drinks offers early on and I can\u2019t remember later on so the offers must have lasted all night (unlike me). Another tip for 1st time travellers to Rome \u2013 There are thousands of traffic wardens with a booth on every street corner but they seem to be a bad investment as the roads are nuts and dont seem to have any laws. Red lights appear to mean the same as green and what you think looks like a 2 lane road can suddenly become a 6 lane free for all. If you have to get a taxi just get in and close your eyes until you are either asked to pay or you hear the sound of crunching metal.. seriously it\u2019s crazy!", "Date": "February 16, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Norway", "Title": "\u201cMy favourite hotel in Rome\u201d", "Author": "Martel_8", "ReviewID": "UR123864898", "Content": "We love Italy as vacation county and travel at leat twice a year.

And to find a decent hotel within walking distance of nearly everywhere at a reasonable (compared with nearby) price? The room was far from enormous but it was clean and comfortable. On booking, some confusion was caused between booking direct (145 euros - with shower) or through internet (90 euros but possibly without shower). Better safe than sorry, so we booked direct - but it transpired that most bookings through internet do actually get a shower. That is the luck of the draw - we preferred not to take the chance. There is only a slot machine for coffee and cold drinks which we failed to operate properly or at all; but the numerous cafes etc next door and nearby made up for that. The roof terrace is indeed charming; the 2nd floor terrace (by the incomprehensible machines) likewise. The numerous groups of American students, German ramblers and French families with young children did tend to make a bit of noise (even after 11.00 pm, despite the notices requesting them not to do so) but you get what you pay for. Someone will doubtless be able to explain why the youth of America feels it necessary to shout down a telephone at 1.00 am as if trying to make themselves heard across the Atlantic. These are minor problems - together with the occasional false fire alarm - which do not detract from the sheer convenience of the place and the price. Nearby hotels (which I investigated) started at about 350 euros per night. Fine if you are on expenses, but we are not.

But I've been back for a visit after a four year gap and while not much has changed in terms of the rooms and way the place is run, the prices have skyrocketed by nearly 25% in that time, making what was once a great budget hotel into a marginal and overpriced dive. That's a harsh word to use, but they charged me 100 euros a night for a miniscule, monastic room with tired furniture and a seriously bad smell of drains. When it was 75 euros a night I was perfectly happy with the 1930s chairs, vintage bedspreads, and vending machines instead of breakfast. And it does have some incredible advantages: a gorgeous, meandering rooftop terrace full of flowers and trees and shaded corners where you can sit with a bottle of wine, and possibly THE best location of any single other hotel in Rome. But this time round the place was overrun with several school groups of homesick teenagers slumped over their laptops, Skype-ing their friends back home. (I wanted to ask, why bother traveling in the first place? but that's for the forum, not here...) And another group of students had taken over the beautiful terrace with rack after rack of clothes they'd hung out to dry. Somehow that glass of Chianti isn't quite so appealing when you're sitting next to some backpacker's underwear. It's truly a shame about this hotel -- it's always been a wonderful bolt-hole for lovers of Rome with little cash.

If you are looking for a \"service oriented\" hotel and luxurious accomodations don't stay at the Albergo del Sole. You'll hate it. However, if you want charming then shell out the 160 euros per room and ask for the 5th floor rooms. We had rooms 514 and 515 which had great views of the domes of San Andrea del Valle and Il Gesu. Room 514 had three twin beds, shower stall, and bathroom, while room 515 had a queen size bed with a twin. Both rooms had armoires for storage. The floors are tile and the ceilings have exposed wooden beams that were lovely. The folks at the front desk had car service arranged to and from the airport and yes we had to pay in cash for our rooms but I don't see how that's a big deal. No one asked to keep our passports. The hotel has a small elevator which we used when taking our bags up to the rooms, which were arranged suite-like. There are absolutely fantastic restaurants in the Campo di Fiori area, including Al Bric and Ristorante de Pancrazia (which is over ruins of the Theater of Pompi) which we loved. Plus Piazza Navona, the Pantheon, Trastever (south of the Tiber) are only 10 to 15 min. walk. Not far from the Vatican or the Roman forum either.

We come back to drop off stuff and change for dinner. THis place is next to one of the GREATEST restaurants that are not too well known and is a total Locals place, Monte Carlo. Only a few blocks by foot. It has one of the best pizza joints in the world across the street and it is next to a live and buzzing night time hangout for both youth and middle aged folk alike.

I like to go to the top roof and hang for a bit and smoke a ciggy and have a glass of wine before going out. it has a view of the roof tops of rome that is different from all the magazines. Its a bit eclectic. The shower is hot and the bed is soft. Its an old place and it shows but it is definitely inhabitable and central. in the morning walk outside, cut a left and go 50 feet for some quick breakfast at the BAR. A fresh scone, blood orange juice and a cafe. Chill for a spell, and then hit the sights that are well within 5 minutes in any direction. take what you want from this review but it is what it is. it all depends on the type of traveler you are and what you expect out of a hotel. I stayed in Venice at a 4 star and paid $500 american a night. it was awesome. And yet i always come back to the albergo for the ambiance of the location. I like having a room on the street so that at night i can open the window and hear the party goers.

My room, number 401, had a double bed (comfortable), chair and wardrobe, a bathroom with shower (clean!) and windows looking out onto the inner courtyard, with the domes of two churches peaking over the eves. True, it isn't a 5- or 4-star hotel. It does not have a restaurant on the premises and the entrance to the hotel is slightly foreboding for those of us that aren\u2019t used to old cities. There is also a flight of stairs that must be taken to reach the front desk and the elevator, which could be a draw-back for those with accessibility issues. However, for the tourist, staying within the walls of the hotel isn't the goal. When visiting, I love to walk around and get a feel for the area. The Albergo Del Sole Al Biscione is perfect for the walker as its steps away from the Campo di Fiori and, within a 2 kilometre radius (1.2 miles), you\u2019ll be able to find St. Peter\u2019s Square, Trevi Fountains, Piazza Novana, Piazza Venezia and the Coliseum. Bottom line: you truly can\u2019t find a better place to stay location wise. And there are restaurants, caf\u00e9s and bakeries a-plenty just around the corner, providing a great variety of foods to temp your palate. (A suggestion: go to Il Fornaio (?) on Via dei Baullari, not even 2 minutes away. It\u2019s a great little walk-in bakery with carry-away lunch fare and lovely, lovely desserts!)

The first stay we were in the front of the hotel right on the Campo di Fiori. There was so much life going on right outside, and we loved it, but if you don't like noise, reserve in one of the back rooms. Also, if you like air conditioning, book one of the rooms on the top floor. OUr second stay we were in a back room with no air conditioning during a heat wave, and that wasn't as pleasant. For an extra 40 Euros, it's worth the fifth floor room. The staff at the hotel are great, always there to book you a cab or recommend a restaurant or give you directions. Right across from the hotel is a 24 hour shop where you can get anything - wine, water, snacks, breakfast, coffee - anything! There are stairs leading up to reception, but then you can get on the elevator for the rest of the hotel. This is one of the oldest hotels in Rome, and it is quite and adventure to be in the presence of such history. The rooftop patio is a nice addition, although with the Campo so close, who is ever there long enough? I would definately reocmmend staying at the Albergo del Sole for your stay in room, but be aware that this is a no-frills hotel. Also, if you are coming or going to the airport, organize with the hotel to get the 47 Euro transfer.

The roof garden, for those staying here in warm weather (and it was warm enough for us in mid-November), is wonderful, overlooked by the dome of St. Andrea del Valle, with plenty of potted plants.

While it is right in the center of a beautiful piazza, the hotel itself is very basic. The rooms are tiny, and look to have been last updated in the 1970s. Not that this is a bad thing--in Rome a clean, safe, relatively inexpensive hotel can be heard to come by. This hotel only takes cash, which became a big problem for us when the Rome bank's internet connections went down and we couldn't get cash out. The gentleman at the front desk of the Albergo helped us to find a solution and was very kind about the situation. Choose this hotel for the location and for a simple no-frills place to sleep.
