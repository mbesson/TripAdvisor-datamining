Their administration in terms of settling the bill is awful. We had paid Ebookers for the trip and did not owe them anything for the accommodation. On checking in they took our credit card details \u2013 a standard procedure for security purposes I thought. However, when returning home and checking our credit card statement, they had taken the money! We had double paid this \u2013 through Ebookers, correctly and through the hotel itself incorrectly! Since returning home I have been emailing Ebookers to get this resolved and they have identified that Avari were at fault. At the moment, they are trying to sort this out, but I have just taken matters in to my own hands and called them. Maybe its just my impatience, but the frustrations are getting the better of me. They said they will look into this I will need to call them back tomorrow. Its just over a month since checking out and I am still no nearer to getting my money back. I only hope that I can update this review very soon and confirm a refund from them very soon. Overall the Avari is not a bad hotel, but their admin side leaves a lot to be desired.

Go out, turn left, walk 50 meters and you are on main Rigga road. Turn left again and walk straight to the metro station. Taxi is easily available at the doorstep of the hotel. The breakfast and food quality is average. Service is good and speedy. The reception staff is friendly and guided us well in response to our queries. A shuttle service is available to go to \"The Outlet Mall\". This mall is quite far and out of the way from Dubai. And I advice not to spend 120 Dirhams on taxi for going there and coming back when you can use the shuttle which leaves at 11:00 a.m. and returns at 3:00 p.m. There is a small bar on ground floor which was offering beer on \"buy one get one free\" basis.

My room, unlike Pierre's was was spacious, but not hugh, with a great king bed, flat screen TV, and all the stuff that makes a hotel comfortable. To me it was comparable to a Holiday Inn. I was pleased that the H/AC functioned to perfection, since I needed both during my stay. The bath was suitably marblized, and the paper was a nice morning treat. I had also worried about the nightclub noise which vexed poor Pierre. Although the lobby was a bit raucous, the noise didn't make it up to me on an upper floor. The pub was actually quiet enough to do some work in My major disappointments were in the expensive room internet and an inferior albeit pricey buffet breakfast (runny scrambled eggs!).

The buffet breakfast that was complimentary in our hotel package was not the greatest, I found myself eating croissants and watermelon only. Due to this inconvenience of our first night we were bumped up to a suite room, which reeked even more! Even leaving the windows open and spraying perfume did not help. Staff is kind. They call themselves a 4 star hotel rated my emirates airlines, but I would say a 2 star. Not even worthy of 3 star. And they charge a rediculous Amount per night. ..we paid $113 a night since we booked thru emirates airlines but their charges at the reservations desk per night were $300 for a standard room!!! I do not reccomend this hotel, thank god we were only there for 2 nights and then had reswervations for another 2 nights at the crowne plaza which is a superior five star hotel, and lives upto it! We loved the crowne plaza, its the best! We would definately go to the crowne on our next visit! We could not get availability for our first 2 nights in crowne plaza otherwise we wouldve stayed all 4 nights at the crowne plaza. We also bought our hotel accomodation for the corwne thru emirates airlines, since they offer disc if you fly with them. And it was $150 per night for a gogeous standard room with compl breakfast incl, and the breakfast was out of this world! It is worth it!!! The prices of these rooms will probably be cheaper during other seasons since mar-may is peak season for them. Hope the review helps!
