Our bathroom was very basic and though large was rather depressing so the only negative (also after a very rainy day, nothing left in the bathroom was dry in the morning). We had a triple room that had two TV's, didn't use them but our son was excited to have his own options. The breakfast room was fantastic for the view and the food. Service was excellent from lobby to terrace and we would not hesitate to stay here again.

Breakfast is served on the rooftop by two very efficient and professional men. I repeat myself when I'm happy with a hotel and reviewing by saying a \"hotel is only as good as its management and staff\" and it is so true. The breakfast provided boiled eggs, cheeses, tomatoes, cucumbers, meats, scrambled eggs, cereal, \"delicious\" fresh bread, yogurt and honey and more.

The hotel is about a 30 second walk from the Hippodrome and right beside the Blue Mosque, Aya Sofya, cistern, the main shopping street and about 10 mins walk to the Grand Bazaar. It was lovely to just walk around the cobbled streets and enjoy the pretty window-boxes and old buildings. The hotel is on a small side street which can get very busy and congested in the afternoons. We closed our windows one afternoon to catch a nap and generally kept the windows closed at night to keep some of the noise out. But this was a minor problem and well worth the great location. The airport transfer guy was very nice and drove safely (unlike all the other drivers in Turkey). He had to wait over an hour for us to clear customs but there wasn't a word of compaint and he got us to the hotel quickly but in one piece.

The room was tiny but very clean with all necessary amenties: a safe (complimentary), hair dryer, tv and fully fitted bathroom. We had a corner room on the 4th floor, overlooking the Marmara Sea.

I would say our stay was just average. The pickup from the airport (free) was so late we started looking for other options to get to the hotel. At 11:00 at night we were less than thrilled. We finally found him & although a bit annoyed, decided not to let this hinder our vacation. The greeting at the hotel was quite icy...maybe because it was late, but there was a young boy who showed us to our room who was very sweet. The room was nothing to write home about....which is why I only give this hotel 3 stars. Although it was large, it was sparsely furnished & looked NOTHING like the pictures on the internet. There was 1 double bed & 1 twin bed, a few night stands and a mini fridge with overpriced drinks. I was expecting a plush feeling room and instead it felt quite cold. The bathroom was nice however. It was quite spacious and after coming from Greece where we had no stand up showers, the big shower was a luxury. We didn't complain because it was just too late and we were too tired. The breakfast was very nice at the roof of the hotel. It was raining both mornings we ate there, but I'm sure it would have been even nicer to eat outside. There was a wide variety of items both \"American\" style and Turkish. The apple tea is the best!!!! For non-smokers, you'll be happy to know the inside area is smoke free, which we found to be rare in Turkey. There is a computer with free internet in the lobby for guest use. The location of this hotel is very good. It is on a quiet side street close to Blue Mosque, Topkapi, and St. Sophia. You can walk to many restaurants. We found it a bit disorienting to take the tram to the Egyptian Market. We were there during Ramadan and in the park near the hotel there were many food stalls and vendors out at night. Families came to have their dinner and many of them made picnics on the lawn. It was really nice to stroll around and sample so many foods from Turkey in one place. I am not sure who people were dealing with when they write about the great service at this hotel. On a few instances we asked the older man at the front desk some questions....about getting around, restaurants, etc....and he always seemed annoyed to be bothered and didn't give us much help. The morning we were checking out he tried to charge us in Lira, not Euros, which we were quoted in. He kept giving us the price in euros and then changing it to Lira using his calculator. The rate his was using in his conversion was nothing near the rate at the exchange offices. He also tried to charge us for 2 drinks from the mini bar, that we did not drink. He did end up taking that off our bill. I felt like we were being ripped off, but our bus was waiting to take us to the airport and could not argue anymore. The whole thing was quite shady. We took a shared van to the airport which we booked through a small cafe on the corner of the street in front of the hotel. It was a better value for us rather than taking a taxi, but be aware, they make many stops, so if you are one of the first hotels to be picked up, plan extra time to get there. All in all, the rooms were just o.k., location was good and breakfast was great. While not expensive it wasn't as cheap as some of the other hotels we saw in the same area. I booked it because it looked more luxurious and wanted something a bit more posh while in Istanbul and because of that I was disappointed.

They provide a good Turkish breakfast, with plenty of variety. They also have a convenient Internet facility. But the best part of the Fehmi Bey is the staff -- they are extremely helpful without being intrusive.
