We had a message on our phone saying we had a package at the desk. They could not find anything??????? So who knows where it is. I left a note to be sent to Branson Vacationland that we needed to turn in before we left showing we had taken advantage of the presentation we were assigned (tried to leave it with them directly but they were closed as we left early a.m) so the checkout person said,reluectantly, that they could send it when they sent their next billing to BV. I asked that she run a copy for me, sign and date it so I had something to followup with in the event they did not do it. She grabbed a pen and scribbled on the copy and \"shoved\" it at me.

I picked up those packets and brought them to the front desk and asked them when each person checked in please give them each a packet. They did not give one person a packet, the Front Desk staff was downright snarky, as if I was asking them to do to much. The hotel messed up the Cocktail Hour suite for both nights, and when I called to complain they did NOTHING to make it right, it was so clear that they could actually care less that I was unhappy. As for the hotel itself, it is old and outdated. The bathroom in my room was old. The blanket on the bed looked to be about 20 years old and pilling and I didn't feel comfortable using it. There are 3 different buildings in which one can stay, I found it confusing and the building we were in was the a long walk to the Front desk and where breakfast was. I could not more unhappy about this experience and will never go there again. Branson itself is a pretty cool place, lots to do for music fans, outdoor fans, etc. We went horse back riding at Sheppard Hills, and that was a wonderful experience. We had an hour long ride for $25 you can't beat that. The places we had dinner \"Montana Mikes\" and \" Florentina's\" were both really good food and great service.

This place is perfect for the family as the rates are favorable (especially if you have a Entertainment Card). The breakfast buffet they provide has hot food (eggs, sausage, french toast sticks, biscuits and gravy) along with your typical hotel breakfast food. There are two swimming pools and both were busy when we were there. Each pool has a hot tub, but one was closed for maintenance. The hallways and rooms could be lit brighter and it is an older hotel.

We were furious! My son has asthma and is allergic to mold, so their was obvious we could not stay here. My husband went to the front desk and talked to Dorothy (who was very apologetic). She offered us the other rooms available ( which at 8:00 on the day before memorial day was very slim) but 4 of those 5 also had mold in the air conditioning vents. The other room only had a queen size bed, which would not work for 4 people. Although I booked a \"non refundable\" room through Expedia, Dorothy helped us get our money refunded. The staff could not have been any better.... We couldn't be angry with them because they didn't know, but I find it hard to believe that management could not be aware of the problem.

We had to walk all the way down the hill to the first bldg to eat breakfast (thank goodness the weather was nice and not raining) -- there were not enough tables to sit and eat at 8am - as there were 3 large bus groups there. We had to take our food out to the lobby and eat. The food was NOT hot on Friday morning - OK on Sat. & Sun - no do-nuts except on Friday morning. No bacon (as shown in your picture). The back deck off of our bldg. was splintered, needs painting badly - one railing was not safe - I would be afraid for an older person or child to be out there). Bathrooms are tiny with one small sink (not enough room to set our personal stuff on it) and my husband is 6'5\" and had to leave the door open to use the bathroom. TVs are small (possibly 17 -19 inch) in a huge armour that took up lots of room. Rooms are small with no closet but a hanging rack on the main wall. We saw several people HAVING A HARD time pushing people in wheel chairs up that hill to our bldg after breakfast and older people having problems getting from the 3rd bldg to the 1st bldg to eat breakfast.

Upon entering the elevator the signs were in broken frames and the carpet was very dirty in Bldg B. When we got to our \"themed room\" we were greeted by a mural of kangaroos on the wall and a leather like pillow on the bed. The jacuzzi was no more than a single person whirlpool tub you would find in a house. The bathroom was very tiny. The towels were very itchy and hard. The tv in the room was so small and outdated it was hard to watch. The carpet in the room was very dirty looking. We could here everything the people above us were doing and the ones around us. When we called the front desk to ask for another room they said the only room was a room with two queen beds and on the first floor. We would get it for the same price we paid for our \"themed\" room. We chose to stay put. Finally the noise eased down a little and we were able to sleep.

I have worked in the hotel industry and I know that lost and found should never be guarded by one single person on the housekeeping staff.

To start with the positives, the location was awesome, right off the strip with very little traffic running through so at night you could sleep with the windows open. The staff was pleasant and accommodating. We brought our dog and asked that they don\u2019t clean the room because I feared the dog would get loose and they accommodated that request. When we checked into our King bed room, it was very small and the scene outside the window was less to be desired (it looked out into the alley) and they graciously moved us to a higher up room with two queen beds. The outside grounds were clean and for the most part the inside was too. Things we were not happy with were the pool facilities, the \u201chot\u201d breakfast, the bath tub floor and the outdated bedding. The two pools were very outdated and looked dirty. Hence that is why you only see one picture of it online. The breakfast was terrible and I guess that\u2019s what you get when it\u2019s \u201cFree\u201d. I would recommend only going to it if you want a light snack, otherwise spend the 5.99 at the Plantation or go down the road to Panera Bread. I\u2019m picky about cleanliness so when I noticed the bedding had cigarette burns tells me that have not changed over bedding in years. I threw it off the bed for the remainder of the trip. The bath tub floor creaked so bad I thought it was going to break. They can do a much better job at vacuuming too. Overall it was okay compared to others that were on the strip, but again, we only paid $59.99 plus $12.00 for the pet so we got what we paid for in the end. I probably won\u2019t be back to the Castle Inn knowing there were other nicer places that take pets.

The hotel is located just off the main road going through the Branson attractions but was joined by many other hotels on the same road. The staff was helpful and polite. As I mentioned, I stayed there because of a function there. If I was going to Branson for any other reason I would probably stay at a more up to date chain hotel. Branson is a nice town, nice folks, temp not bad for summer time, and family friendly. Its alot like Gatlinburg, TN, just a bit smaller. We drove from the Kansas City airport, which was almost 4 hours. I would recommend flying into Springfield instead. Its about a 1 hour drive from there.

I always do research on trip advisor every year before deciding where to stay, I have decided that one persons trash is definetly another person's treasure after this year in Branson. I choose this hotel after reading all the good reviews on here when I really should have listened to the bad! We ended up leaving a day early and arrived at the hotel on the 3rd, around 2a.m., the women at the front desk was very nice and helpful. She scanned my card and gave us the key to our room, when we got up there I figured up the price of our rooms, I was quoted $59.99 a night for a double queen for the 1st five nights, then we were going to move to a suite the last night which I was quoted $99. I figured up the total and it only came to a little more than $400, but she charged me $526. I called down to the front desk and told her this and she apologized and said that someone had put the rate at $99 for the double queen and that she hadn't even figured in the suite yet, so that was $200 more than we were supposed to be charged, she then told me that it was just a hold on my account until we checked out and it would drop off when we were actually billed. She told me to speak to someone in the morning. The next morning I went back to the office and was told that there is nothing they could do until Tuesday because of the Holiday weekend and I needed to speak to the office manager. Monday I went to the front desk again and the general manager was there, when I spoke to him he didn't even act like he cared! I told him that because of there mistake we were out $200 in our checking account because it was being held. Tuesday I again went and talked to the general manager who actually did contact my bank and got them to release the hold, thank goodness, but when I talked to him about some other problems that I had he acted like he did not care at all. OK now on to some of the problems ;) Upon arriving in the room we always check the sheets and blankets, just to make sure ya know. One of the beds had a crusty stain on the blanket, have know idea what it was nor do I want to know, we were so tired that my husband just pulled it off and slept on the sheets, which were ok I guess. In front of the sink was a huge water spot, I mean it was soaked, like someone got out of the shower and drip dried in that spot, I did call the office about this and they did take care of it, my husband put a towel over it the 1st night and when he lifted it it was nasty! The was some white stain on the floor in front of the bathroom, again gross! When we got back to the motel the 1st day, housekeeping had made my bed but had not touched my husbands, we called for clean linens and they had someone bring them up, we had to make the bed ourselves. The second day they didn't put everything on the beds just left them lying in the corner of the room. The rooms are small, the bathrooms tiny, the swimming pools are ok, the hot tub did not have enough water in it and the breakfast, we tried it once and after that we ate at Starvin Marvin's, which was delicious, review coming for them also. Had we not had issues with the money situation we would have left and gone to another motel, as it was we did not stay in the suite but went to another motel for $20 more which was alot nicer. Oh about that, I went to the office and told them that we would not be staying in the suite and the woman at the counter told me to just tell them in the morning when we check out so I did and they asked me why I did say something the day before, so I told them what happened, they were basically going to charge me for that night because the girl wouldn't cancel it the night before, but thank goodness did not.", "Date": "July 11, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ohio", "Title": "\u201cAdequate but marginal\u201d", "Author": "chowhound03", "ReviewID": "UR69372593", "Content": "Not a bad place, but not very good either.

Upon booking this hotel with ReserveBranson.com I checked tripadvisor and most reviews said good things.! Were these people blind? or they didnt check the sheets and blankets! There were some bad reviews too. I called and ensured our reservation and the lady told me it was confirmed! I asked her if the hotel was clean and she assured me it was. Well room 506 was not clean and the hallway stunk and as we entered into the room the floor was wet from the sink leaking. The sheet on one of the beds had copper colored stains near the top and the pillows were stained really bad. Staff was nice and sent pillows to our room three times and sheets once. One of the pillows I checked just before my 8 year old daughter was about to put her head down on it and it appeared to be molded. I have pictures on my phone and will post after I transferr them to my computer. We were only there for like three hours. At 11pm I contacted the Holiday Inn Express on Green Mountian Drive and Josh gave me a great rate to help compensate the poor quality of the Stone Castle. I had to take my wife, 6 week old daughter, and my 8 year old daughter out at 11 pm to take them to a clean place for them to sleep! I have called reservebranson and am awaiting their call back.

You could definitly tell that they put some time and money into the renovation. The beds were comfy and the a/c worked great. Since it was so hot during our stay, in the 100's, the indoor pool was very inviting. My oldest son and I spent a great amount of time in the pool. When he wasn't in the pool, he was in the gameroom which is right next to the pool. Breakfast consisted of waffles, donuts, scrambled eggs, biscuits and gravy, and juice. There were two ladies that set up the breakfast and they both were so nice each morning. The best part of the breakfast was the live entertainment. I had never stayed at a hotel in branson where they provide morning entertainment. The music was provided by Cowboy Tucker and Mr. Yeary. They are part of a show in the Branson area. They are funny and have wonderful voices. Mr. Yeary approached me and we talked about my youngest son who was sitting with me at breakfast. On the last day, three of the five daughters of the Warnock family came in and sang a song and gave out discount coupons for their show located at the Branson Mall. If you have time, check them out.

Its very much a budget based place without many frills. But if the price is right - why complain? Pluses: Good service, inexpensive, friendly, everything works, nice bath fixtures Negatives: the continental breakfast is kind of sad, but the hot breakfast isn't any better. Canned peaches made up the fruit area and the eggs were very mysterious. The water is hot, the sheets are good enough - but don't expect the Ritz.", "Date": "October 31, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Midland", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Hobbes20", "ReviewID": "UR10379438", "Content": "We spent 5 days, 4 nights at this location and it was very clean, quiet and comfortable at a great rate.

The continental breakfast with entertainment each morning was fantastic. The location was very convenient as well.

This place was a dump. The first day that we arrived, we got to our room only to find pet hair all over the bed and floors. Like they didn't vacuum after the last guest. Then when we pulled the comforter back from the head of the bed there were toenail clippings all over the floor. The window didn't lock at all nor was there any security device on it. We called the front door ASAP and they did move us over to another room. We only stayed here cuz' we got it through Stormy Point Resorts(not good for them). the second room wasn't much better. The window didn't lock again, the floors were wet under the bed, the hair dryer didn't work at all and was busted at the air intake, the bedding smelled like mildew, etc. The moring breakfast as nothing to brag about. They gave us a coupon for a 2.99 buffet, but it never happened, when we asked about it, they front dest sid they had no idea what was going on there. The buffet staff never showed up and wouldn't return any calls. This was the same for the entiire 4 days we were there. The pools were cold as well and the hot tubs. The second moring we were there I went to the hot tub at 7am. and while I was there the janitor came in to test the waters and temps. I told him that the hot tub didn't need anymore chemicals cuz; the fumes alone were buring my eyes. The next thing we noticed was later that moning the hut tub and pool were emptied and closed for repairs. Go figure. The third morning I went to the second hot tub and again the janitor came in and while I was in the hot tub he \"backwashed\" the hot tub and the next thing I knew was there about 50 big black bugs in the tub with me. I freaked out!!!!!! This was sick and unacceptable. I will never stay here again. I will make sure to tell people about out experence and warn them. The decor was very outdated and very dark. Funny this was the sign in front of hotel said, \"2007 renovations completed!\" One last note, due to the fact that they allow pets, the second night we were there we went out for a walk and someone had let their dog crap all over the hall. Not seeing it due lack of lighting and dark carpet we stepped in in and it was all over our room and children then. How sick is this!!!! So over all this was the WORST experience we have ever had and will never go back.", "Date": "September 7, 2007"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "The Stone Castle Hotel & Conference Center", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g44160-d121241-Reviews-The_Stone_Castle_Hotel_Conference_Center-Branson_Missouri.html", "Price": "$65 and up*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">3050 Green Mountain Drive</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:municipality\">Branson</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">MO</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">65616</span></span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "121241", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/1c/ab/33/the-stone-castle-hotel.jpg"}}
