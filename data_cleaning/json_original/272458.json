We paid roughly \u20ac100 per night (which appears to be cheap in Rome) and stayed for 3 nights around mid-September. The hotel was perfect, the room we stayed in was big, had its own bathroom and had an amazing balcony overlooking the street, from which you could see the river. Upon arrival we were greeted with a bottle of local red wine and given a rough guide to where everything is (including a map to help out). Everything me and my girlfriend went to see was within walking distance, we literally didn't get one cab or bus for the whole stay. The colosseum is a good walk (maybe 25 minutes) but Rome is so beautiful that it is absolutely no chore. Most corners you turn contain something beautiful or ancient. The squares there are great for the early evening, and in September the weather was amazing. My only very slight criticism is that the hotel appears to be in a business district in Rome, so not many eateries and restaurants in the immediate vicinity will stay open late. But to cross the river to the 'tourist' side of Rome only takes 5 minutes, and over there everything is open until late. Due to it being in a more quiet part of the city, everything is much quieter at night - so a good nights sleep is easy to come by!

Although it required a little rescheduling for him to make it there by the 9pm check-in time, he was happy to make it in time to do some exploring before I arrived the next morning. It was also really nice to have free internet access during our few nights there although we had to go into the hallway to get a signal. Having the bus so close made it easy to get around although we wound up walking most of the time (bring comfy shoes and be careful on the stairs down as they can be a bit slippery). It was nice not to have to stay by the train station, but to know that it was easy enough to get to when it was time for us to leave for Florence. In the evening, that area seemed to quiet down considerably, so on the way back, you may want to grab water or whatever you'll need before crossing the Ponte Cavour. One thing that there's no shortage of in Rome is places to eat though; my boyfriend went out and found some of the best pizza I had on our whole trip on my first night there when I was too tired to go out. I only truly came to appreciate the neighborhood that we were in on our last night in Rome, when there was no availability at Antiqua Roma and we had to stay near the train station where the streets are much more hectic and filled with tourists (although you can never truly escape us). We had a nice double room with a balcony and an en suite bathroom, which was great. Enrico let us leave our bags in the hallway for a few hours after checking out (the check out is a little early at 10am), which was helpful although then we did not have access to a bathroom. Even though there are bathrooms in the hallway, they are for the rooms, so there's no communal restroom to use, FYI. Others have mentioned the street noise, which was there, but not much of a problem for us. Waking up to the sounds of an Italian argument and some horn honking was oddly entertaining and just a good reminder to get out there and start exploring. The shutters completely darkened the room so if not for the noise, I may have slept through the whole beautiful morning.

The room is very nicely decorated with many amenities you can find in a regular hotel but with an added personal touch in decoration. Our host Enrico is one of the nicest persons we met during our travels who goes out of his way to help us for everything we may need. The location is perfect. It is located just across the river next to Palace of Justice. Every place you want to visit in Rome is within walking distance. For example one of the furthest touristic place colosseum is 30 minutes away by walking. Of course, on your way you see lots of wonderful distractions, this duration may increase considerably.

Room size is decent, with a miniscule TV, wifi & a sink. The location is excellent, within walking distance to all major spots. The only hassle we had was when we first arrived in Rome from termini station but it might be due to me who choosed took Bus # 492 instead of bus #70 as advised by Enrico.

There is a bus shuttle that goes directly to Fumicino Airport (about 5 mins walks from B&B, 8 Euros per pax). Took about 1 hour to reach from B&B to airport, since traffic was pretty jam at 8:30am..

If you are paranoid about safety and a lazy traveller like us who love checking out St Pietro at night but too darn lazy to take a bus/metro to get back to the hotel, this is a good place for you. You can snap pictures all you want at St Pietro, feel the precious-breezy-holy moment, enjoy the atmosphere, buy some hot dogs along the way and get home safe and happy. We are girls by the way. 2) Good rate - The double room is at a reasonable rate, spacious, uniquely Rome nice and most importantly, it's neat and CLEAN!! and I love the toilet. :) I am very particular about toilets. Sucky toilet is a definite no-no for me. And and... :) they make up your room everyday. Yay! :) 3) Great host - Enrique is friendly, very efficient and one English speaking dude. He showed us the map on where to go ,how to go and how long it takes to get to a place. And oh, he's very generous as well. If your stay falls on your birthday you will get a complimentary champagne bottle by surprise. :) :) Nice naw? And he gives us free map! Double Yay! 4) Internet - It's nice to feel connected to the cyber world for FREE! :) In our other stays in Paris, Florence, etc, we have to pay to get connected. :( So it feels like home when you can check your Facebook every now and then. In fact, that's what we do every night at Antiqua Roma -- yes we are paranoids and have no life. :P We are missing Antiqua Roma already... cheesy it may sound but it's the truth.

The location is ideal if you don\u2019t mind walking. If not, there is a couple of bus stops very close and the nearest subway stop is at the Spanish Steps, about 15-20 minutes away by foot. When you walk out of the B&B, you have your choice of 3 directions depending on where you want to go. There are two bridges close, both less than 5 minutes walk, that take you to the most popular destinations. To get to the Vatican is very easy, it\u2019s about 10 minutes away. The Pantheon, Piazza Navona, Trevi Fountain, and the Spanish Steps are about a 20 minute walk, with the Colosseum and Trastevere area about 30 minutes walk. I bought the Roma Pass at the airport and didn\u2019t use it to it\u2019s full potential. I took the subway to the train station to pick up a car once and took the subway to the Colosseum once, and walked back. I took a taxi from the train station upon arrival and it cost me Euro 35,00 and it took about 15 minutes in traffic. The Building has an elevator and we had no problem getting our large suitcases and duffels up to the room. Enrico met us at the top of the elevator and showed us to our room. We arrived early in the morning and our room was ready for us already which was nice. We got the room without the insuite bath.

The bathroom is down the hall and private. There really isn\u2019t a common area and we only saw one other couple in the hallway the entire time we where there. The room had a large double bed with a canopy and there was a small bottle of wine waiting for us. The fixtures were modern and there were plenty of places to plug in cellphones, laptops, etc. We stayed 3 nights in late June and it was very hot in Rome.

Planning a new trip to Rome is always a pleasure, but is also fraught with anxiety, even for those who have been there before: where will we stay? Will we be disappointed - or worse, will we get ripped off, will something go wrong? This time, I looked for a B&B, which would offer good value for money, would be pleasant to stay at and would really, actually be in the city centre (they all seem to be located \"in the heart of the city\", even when this means you have to walk four kilometres or take the metro for half an hour). Antiqua Roma is in fact centrally located, good value, and a really nice place to stay. At 100 Euro a night for a double room, you can't find better value many places in the city. The owner, Enrico, is really nice and helpful. The rooms are cosy; ours was in the back, which deprived us of a view, but made for no traffic noise, and besides, when staying at a B&B, what else is there to do except sleep? You don't hang around the room anyway, with Rome just outside. Antiqua Roma is in the Prati district, which is peaceful and where you'll find good restaurants aplenty. Via Cola di Rienzo is Rome's main shopping street (for Romans, that is, only tourists and the superrich shop in Via Condotti), and it's close by. A good ten minutes of walking, and you're at Piazza Navona or Piazza del Popolo, fifteen minutes, and you're at Saint Peter's Square. That's the beauty of staying in the Prati region, it really is centrally located, you won't need public transport for any of the sights in central Rome, and it's authentically Roman in an non-touristy way. I've stayed in various B&B's and less savoury hotels across Rome, and Antiqua Roma is the only place I can truly say I want to return to. In fact, until the time comes when I can afford to stay at Albergo del Sole and pay 400 euro a night, I'm going to toss my bags at Enrico's place.

It was very clean, nice size room, bathroom although spotlessly clean was a little tight (we had our private bath in the shared hall). The room had a sink in it which was a nice touch when your bathroom is down the hall. I selected this place after reading all the reviews and its availability for our dates in Rome. I was a little concerned about the noise factor that many of the reviews spoke of. Our room was on the outside wall, right above the dumpsters and yes the trash people came by at least twice during our stay, but it really was not the big deal so many people made it out to be. They came, collected the trash and left - all done well before midnight. And you're on holiday in Rome, who is asleep at that time anyway? Also don't let the thought of dumpsters being outside your window scare you, this is Rome there are small dumpsters everywhere. They are not unsightly but part of the Rome landscape really. Also all of Antiqua's rooms are on the 2nd floor, that's 3rd floor to us Americans, so the dumpsters are really a ways down and not outside your windows. The one down side is location for restaurants. Yes there are places just few steps away, especially the places to get your money coffee (at least 3 good ones that we found less than a 5 minute stroll from the door, one right next to the building door). But for dinner purposes the area is a bit deserted. I did find one place only a block away that was very nice, but the other couple places nearby weren't worth it. You really had to hoof it to find dinner locations, which after a long day of hoofing it all over the city could make finding that dinner location tiring.", "Date": "May 14, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Leicester", "Title": "\u201cLoved the place\u201d", "Author": "Chrismcewan", "ReviewID": "UR23233692", "Content": "Incredible place to stay for those who don't need vast luxuries in the room, but do need a place to lay their head in pleasant, safe and intimate surroundings.

We were very impressed with the location of this hotel. It is only a ten minute walk to the Spanish Steps in one direction and the Vatican in the other direction. Very central and very convenient to all of the major tourist attractions. We walked everywhere from this hotel and found that it was the best way to get to know this wonderful city.

The owner and staff of this hotel are very friendly and helpful and also make for a great stay in Rome. The only negative comment that could be made about this place is the lack of insulation.

Tastefully and conveniently furnished (unusually so), spacious and clean. Complimentary white wine and candies on the coffee table. High-ceilinged and well-ventilated. Reasonably powerful rotating fan (but no AC). TV and internal bathroom. Nice old building with character. All of these are good things. A big demerit, though, was the street noise. In ninety-plus-degree weather (Fahrenheit), and in an upper-floor dwelling like this one, it is essential that windows remain open at all times - especially at night, when there's a chance to pull in the cool night air. Unfortunately, open windows also mean noise, and the worst noise involved the garbage pick-up. At exactly midnight every night, a lumbering garbage truck came by, stopped right under our window, and repeatedly went through the following procedure: 1.) powered its hydraulic mechanical arm, 2.) used the arm to lift a gigantic metal dumpster, 3.) emptied the dumpster and its rattling contents into a metal garbage truck, 4.) plunked the dumpster back onto the pavement. Because there are several dumpsters within one or two blocks of the B&B, this nightly process seemed to take about 20 minutes, growing or decreasing in volume according to the truck's proximity, and reaching a cacophonous peak at the moment it stopped right outside our front door. For some people, who might not be trying to sleep at midnight, this would not be an issue. But we were in the habit of getting up early and doing the bulk of our sightseeing during the cool morning hours, so the nightly disturbance had a big impact on us. Note: We believe Antiqua Roma also has rooms facing onto an interior courtyard, and this could be a better option. In extremely hot weather, however, courtyard-facing rooms are often very slow to cool off in the evening. (We know this from experience.) Thanks to this Scylla/Charybdis situation, we would probably not stay at AntiquaRoma again during the summer, room quality notwithstanding. LOCATION: Antiqua Roma is in a pretty good location. The neighborhood itself is more bustling and modern, with wider streets and swifter traffic, than many other neighborhoods in central Rome. This can make you feel like you're well outside the \"historic center.\" However in actuality, sights like the Castel Sant'Angelo, Piazza Navona and the Pantheon are only a short walk away. BREAKFAST: You can get a discount by opting out of breakfast. We did this, and took our breakfast instead at the chocolate shop/coffee bar across the street (Ciocolatti). They will make you an espresso with melted dark chocolate in it. HOST: Enrico is very professional, and speaks English very well. He is also somewhat brusque, as other reviewers have indicated. The housekeeper is very sweet, though she does not speak any English. OTHER STUFF: AntiquaRoma offers free WiFi, and also has a computer in the common area for public use. Another nice feature was the library of fairly up-to-date, big-name travel guides. Like many other Roman B&Bs, AntiquaRoma asks for payment in cash no later than the day before departure. SUMMARY: This is actually a pretty nice place. We're a bit sorry to give it a \"three circle\" review, but the street noise really killed us.
