{"Reviews": [{"Content": "A place to avoid We spent 4 nights on a business trip in this hotel. It was during the Soccer World Cup in Germany, and the prices were extremely high: 90 EUR per night for two of the four nights and 160 EUR (!) per night for the other two nights. The original, normal price is about 40 EUR per night ---and the hotel is *at maximum* worth that price.When we arrived they presented us our rooms. In one of the wardrobes we found some old food (sausage etc.) from a person that previously occupied the room.The shutters were not working. They were all blocked.The hotel is very close to the highway, so it is quite loud when you sleep with the windows open --which is necessary in summer since they have no climate control.The announce on their website that they have wireless internet. In fact it does not work. There is only internet access in a room in the basement (which, the ***only*** positive point, is free of charge).Well, finally, I really would not recommed this hotel!", "Date": "Jun 28, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR902603642", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187337-d613245-r5396943-Garni_Hotel_Roedelheimer_Hof-Frankfurt_Hesse.html", "HotelID": "613245", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
