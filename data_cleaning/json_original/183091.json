I also ate breakfast in the restaurant one morning and the food was quite good (try the egg white frittata if you are diet conscious).

From the second I walked in to this hotel, I was treated very well. It started with the front desk employee who gave me my key; she greated me with a beautiful warm smile and provided me with various information about the hotel and the surroundings. I was checked in within 3 minutes. When we got up to our room, it was spacious. The beds were double beds, which I am not used to seeing anymore; most hotels have queen size beds, which I prefer, especially when travelling with my family. But the beds were comfortable. The rooms were very clean and the bathroom was top notch. About 15 minutes in to our stay at the hotel, we received a knock on the door; I was sure it was someone coming to tell us to get our kids to be quiet. I even said that to them as I opened the door, instead I was greeted by house keeping. She must have been cleaning another room not too far away and heard the kids; she was so friendly and said she wasn't here to complain about the kids, she smiled and gave us a complimentary card for a free movie for the children. I thought that was so sweet of her, she didn't have to do that. The service at this hotel, is excellent. Everyone is very friendly. The room itself again, was clean and spacious. There wasn't much of a view, but that is to be expected as the hotel is in the heart of Toronto. Parking was located directly underneath the hotel at a reasonable rate, considering we were in Toronto. The one thing the hotel room didn't have was a fridge, so if you need one, don't forget to ask when you are booking.

A competitor was virtually as close (Sheraton) but rates here were slightly better. In general, very good. The common areas were all very clean, as was the room.

My recollection was that this would be offered, verbally, on check-in prior to actually happening. It didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t: we were given an Executive Room and charged the (reduced) upgrade cost. Overall, this was ok and I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t comment once I saw the bill, but is probably only worth the additional $40 based upon the general cost of things in downtown Toronto. For this, we were given free Wi-fi (un-used), access to the Executive Lounge and, of course, our room upgrade. The Lounge served free non-alcoholic beverages, hors d\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ouvres and alcohol (priced cheaper than the bar, but self-serve). It was only open until 10 p.m. so was useless to us after the Opera. The hors d\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ouvres were nothing special being spring rolls and gnocchi pomodoro. Its Continental Breakfast purported to be an upgraded version of the standard included fare. While ok, it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t worth $20 each. Having said all of this, the combination of larger room, free non-alcoholic beverages and, at least a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsnack\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 I would likely take the option again for such another special occasion. You can choose considering what you get. The bed was very comfortable and the room was spacious. Toronto is a very busy city, virtually 24/7. The hotel is reasonably sound-proofed in so far as while we could hear sirens regularly while awake, they were muffled enough that they did not keep us awake. Furthermore the three rooms down our hall occupied by a birthday party for an 11 year old girl, did not keep us up either. We were on the 22nd floor which may have been a factor for the sirens, but clearly not for the 11 year old pterodactyls... We ate in the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s restaurant: Tundra.

You're a very short-walk away from Eaton Centre, Toronto City Hall, Union Station, CN Tower, etc. Every major point of interest in downtown Toronto is within walking distance; for sites which are a bit further (e.g. ROM), subway stop is 1 block away on University Street. Good restaurants are also very close (one of the best greek restaurants is less than 1 block away). The hotel is very nice, rooms are VERY big (much bigger than typical hotel room), modern and comfortable. Lobby is very nice, with a good hotel restaurant on the ground floor (perfect for late night munchies), and the basement has Ruth's Chris steakhouse, which is excellent if you're willing to pay. The hotel also has panoramic elevators on University street which is a nice touch. If you're a HHonors gold or platinum member, you will enjoy the lounge on the 30th floor, which is very nicely equipped with a nice view. The staff at the hotel were also very courteous and helpful (the concierge was great!).

The room was clean, and well furnished, Nice big bed, chair/lamp area and desk with outlets. I am not a fan of hotels that charge for Wi-Fi, so that was a disappointment. They do offer free computer stations in the lobby, so I was able to print out boarding pass, check e-mails, etc. No particular view from my 15th floor room, but the glass elevators on the outdoor side were fun.

No non-stop calls or messages at the end of the day to see if I wanted service. If one of the housekeepers saw me come out of my room they would always ask if I needed anything, so they were lovely and attentive in that way. The front desk was always helpful if I had questions. They didn't seem to know where at the Sheraton the airport bus did their pick ups back to the airport.

They also provide a recycling container in the room which was very convenient. Location - Since it was in the financial district, there are very few restaurants at nightime nearby that are open, but you can find some about 5 or 6 blocks away.

The only two negatives was that 1) the pool was closed for renovations, but had I felt like it, they offered us use of the Sheraton pool across the street.

I'm sure if I had called they would have fixed me something, but I was discouraged and went out instead - a more fun decision anyway.

Again, I am not complaining about this, but mentioning it in case you need to have a reliable connection! At check in, ask for a room with a strong signal; I'm sure they have a general idea where the dead spots are. I was on the 29th floor; perhaps that's not a great location?

There is a subway station right across the street and anybody who has used Toronto's subway knows that it is the easiest and most accessible in the world! Hotel is also close to Queen Street which has many great shops and restaurants. While in Toronto, I went with my parents to see a baseball game.

This was the first Hilton I have ever stayed in - traditionally I am a Marriott or a Starwood guy - but I wanted to try a new hotel on this trip. I booked online and was offered a Junior King Suite at time of booking. I checked in online (what a great feature) and the hotel sent me a message via twitter indicating the room I had selected wasn't the best and they would reassign me to a better room on a lower floor. Upon check in, I was given a rundown of all the amenities offered at the hotel and headed up to my room. I was surprised to find a tray of \"cookies of the month\" and a bowl of fresh fruit waiting for me. The fruit was very tasty but the cookies were a bit stale. The first morning we visited the Executive Lounge for a light breakfast. My colleague's room had a funky smell (turns out the shower curtain had mold issues). We mentioned this to the woman working the front desk in the Lounge. She quickly requested a thorough cleaning of his room and gave us complementary restaurant breakfast for the next morning. Unfortunately the room still had a bad smell after the cleaning - the second day they finally replaced the shower curtain and voila! the smell was gone. Each employee I interacted with at the hotel was quite helpful - they truly understood customer service. I felt at home away from home. The hotel is centrally located is a quick walk to Eaton Center, shopping, the ACC, Rogers Centre and the CN Tower. The only negative thing I can say about this property is that the guest rooms are a little outdated and in need of a deep clean (my room had a lot of hair on the furniture and linens, the tub had a dingy yellow tint to it).

My husband and I use them a lot and by and large they rarely fail to deliver. Arriving at the Toronto Hilton was a smooth and calm experience which is very important after a 7 hour flight. Check in staff were efficient and polite. We had a room on the Executive Floor which was spacious with a queen size bed and ample pillows ( I adore the Hilton beds and pillows)! The flaw in the room was the lack of draw space and a particularly small bathroom. Toiletries were plentiful but the sink area was very cramped (us women do tend to take a lot of potions away)! Tea/Coffee facilities in the room are a must and although we had them, they weren't particularly straightforward. Firstly it was a coffee machine which double up for tea as well - ok but a kettle would have been so much easier and a lot quicker. There were no English tea bags and not enough milk sachets. But the biggest sin here was PAPER CUPS!! This is a Hilton for goodness sake, where were the china mugs? We had breakfast for the first four days in the main restaurant which was fantastic. Lots of choices, very friendly staff and excellent service. After that, we went to the Executive Lounge for breakfast which was a bit like a rugby scrum. Absolutely packed in there, not enough tables to sit at and tables not being cleared for ages. Maybe they were short of staff, I don't know. At least there were china mugs in there, although trying to find hot water for my tea took ages. The croissants were nice, the bagels tasted as though they'd been sitting there for a week. We had dinner one evening in the Barrister bar which was great although the quantity of food was immense! Very friendly bar staff and good service. What was surprising though, was that this bar is closed at weekends - very curious. I used the gym a few times which was fine. A variety of machines, each with a tv, and several weights. It was never very busy. The outdoor pool was a bonus as the weather was pretty warm, nice pool area, although the pool does need a bit of upgrading around the sides.

We booked through Priceline and got a great rate. The valet was helpful enough to direct us to the underground lot saving us some money. The elevators are undergoing maintenance but that didn't seem to be an issue getting from the garage to the lobby. Check-in was fast, friendly, and efficient. I inquired about upgrading to a suite upon check-in but none where available. We were however given a king size bed on a higher floor with a view of Nathan Phillips Square. Upon arrival on the 30th floor, it was unbearably hot in the corridor. Saying the air conditioning wasn't working would be an understatement. It actually seemed as if they had the heat on. It was 30 degrees Celsius outside and honestly seemed cooler than the hallway did. Our room was nice. The bed was amazing. We both had a great sleep. The TV is your standard 32 inch LCD hotel TV- LG I believe. Our bathroom needed a bit of work. It seems they have made an attempt to update it, yet there was still an alarming amount of rust and residue around the fixtures and furnishings in the bathroom. I also cannot wrap my head around how a 4 star hotel such as the Hilton cannot provide a fridge in their room,meanwhile the Holiday Inn or other similar price-points provide them free of charge. I've never understood that, and I never will. For dinner, we ventured 5 minutes west on Queen to the Korean Grill House. It is an amazing place where you grill your own food and it gives new meaning to the term \" all you can eat\". For the more expensive and refine tastes, Ruth's Chris is on the lower level and if you like butter and USDA prime, that is the place for you. Upon returning to our room, we were hungry. As expected, a sandwich from the room service menu can be had for the mere sum of your first born and then you add on the service fee and tax and tip. For the price of one person getting a sandwich from the hotel, two of us dined from Pizza Pizza for less money. Ultimately- we got a great rate and had a great sleep but the dangerously hot temperatures in the corridor, the lack of a fridge and the bathroom are what keeps this hotel on the 3.5 side of 4 stars instead of inching up towards that 4.5 mark.

I chose a breakfast rate and a King bedded basic room. On arrival, the lady at the Hhonors desk was extremely welcoming, and seemed particularly welcoming on the basis of my Gold card. She upgraded me to a room on the executive levels and told me I was welcome in the Executive Lounge. After a bit of discussion, we were given our breakfast vouchers. The room is lovely. Beautifully appointed and generously proportioned with a great view across to the water and the CN tower. The executive lounge is truly stunning: large windows on either side and a decent selection of cold drinks, tea and coffee. In the evenings, alcohol is available (chargeable) and hot pasta was available. And it was delicious too. The location was great too, within easy walking distance of everything in this beautiful city. But sadly, I must report some niggles with the breakfast. The buffet is in Tundra restaurant on the ground floor: the selection is outstanding including very fresh Eggs Benedict and all the food is of excellent quality. Unfortunately, they insist on serving orange juice to the table, and service is unreliable. This morning we waiting 30 minutes before our first glass of juice was delivered...on request. Yet more worrying still is the insistence of the staff on, as soon as you arrive, that you have to go to the bar where the \"buffet is identical\". Well yesterday we took their word for it. The bar is dark, dull and the tables are tiny. The food seemed much less fresh (less turnover) and there were no Fruit Loops. Orange juice was available on the buffet, but ran out after our first glass and was never topped up whilst we were there. So in conclusion: great room, outstanding executive lounge and good food at breakfast.

You can only gain access via WiFi in the hotel lobby but you need to get a password from the front desk. Also, in room internet is available for around $14 per day. Parking. There is no onsite parking but you can pay $40/day valet or $24/day to park in the attached parking garage. All in all, the Hilton Toronto is a very nice hotel but I feel there are plenty more options that are less expensive and you would get more for your money. The onsite restaurants are pretty expensive. We're not cheap by any means but a meal at the Steakhouse was $60/person and that was their \"special\" the night we ate there.

Unfortunately arrival at the hotel was not the greatest, we booked over the phone at Hilton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central reservation number and the individual we spoke to did not have many details about the Hilton Toronto\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s facilities. We were promised valet parking as my friend had a truck too tall to fit into most underground garages. When we pulled up we were informed that there was no valet or reserved spots for oversized vehicles, the porter was friendly about it and directed us to a neighbouring outdoor lot. Upon checking in the front desk continued to apologize for the mistake and even upgraded us to a nice room on the executive floor. The room was very clean and the beds comfortable, I do believe they were doubles though, and I think most 4 star hotels should have queens. Not sure what the difference in the layouts of the rooms is between the executive floors and regular ones, but having access to the executive lounge was great. In the evening a wide variety of snacks, appetizers and pastries were available, along with an honor bar. The computers were all being used but the views of the city (i.e. other buildings and a partial glimpse of the lake) were pretty good. After dinner in Toronto followed by drinks in a bar we returned to the Hilton around 2am, and were confronted by large groups of people milling about the lobby. I guess since it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s close to the clubbing district lots of partiers meet up in the lobby and wait for taxis?? I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know, but at least the hotel had a security guard checking for room keys before you could board the elevators. Our package included breakfast the next morning, we choose to dine at the Tundra buffet. Nothing special about the food, typical hotel breakfast fare with watery eggs and overcooked bacon, not worth the $20 I believe it costs. The waiter was also a jerk, expecting greater than a $5 tip for 2 people when he did not come to the table once to clean up our used plates or offer us more coffee. On our way out we stopped in at the executive lounge once again, the breakfast trays set up there looked much better than Tundra, and the coffee/cappuccino maker was a great way to end the stay at the Hilton.", "Date": "March 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cWonderful Stay\u201d", "Author": "totraveller12342", "ReviewID": "UR98779854", "Content": "Had a wonderful stay at the Hilton Toronto in February and the only bad part of my stay was that I was only there for one night.

Fallsview Hilton is hands down one of the best hotels that I've stayed at, and is my hotel of choice anytime I'm in the Niagara region (which is quite often!) and I recommend it to ALL my friends who've also went on to stay there and loved it. That said, I was excited about my stay at the Hilton Downtown for my birthday. I figured it would be a treat, getting to stay in the heart of downtown, with everything at a walking distance. Boy was I in for a surprise. From the moment I arrived, the service was anything but the 4 star quality I've become accustomed to at the Fallsview Hilton. We were told I had the option of one of TWO rooms: A smoking room, or a room with a single bed, and they'd put in a \"cot\" for my friend. My friend's allergic to smoke, and a \"cot\" was definitely not the quality of sleep my friend and I were looking forward to. Now this is in the middle of June, nowhere close to any big events like new year's, so the I found the availability spiel a bit ridiculous. Moreover, when I requested that I speak to the manager, I was told he/she was unavailable. And worst all was the attitude of the front-desk staff! I've NEVER had to put up with anything like that, and I've had to stay at some really cheap hotels the odd time out! Was it because my friend and I are young so we were automatically assumed to be not worthy of good service? We're PAYING guests for crying out loud! Granted, we booked our stay on the \"discount website\" hotwire, but really, if there's a different standard for treating guests who book through those sites, maybe you should not be affiliated with these sites at all! Long story short, I was very, very disappointed, and especially because I've always had great things to say about Hilton hotels. I'm definitely not recommending this hotel to anyone, and especially not my friends and family. I'm sticking to recommending Fallsview Hilton and not the \"Hilton\" chain since there's such a vast difference in the quality of service. My two cents: get the staff from Fallsview to come down and train at least the front desk staff at the Toronto location! The service turned us off so much, that we barely enjoyed the room or whatever else the hotel had to offer. Only came back to the hotel to sleep, and get out first thing in the morning!

The coffee maker, while modern, had no instructions on how to use it so that was useless. The carpet (Room 1520) was torn, stained and generally disgusting.

Loved the updates to the room and bathroom (we had stayed here before a very long time ago... maybe 8 or 9 years ago now). The bathroom now has a glass wall enclosure instead of a tub and shower curtains. The shower has a ceiling spout or a handheld spout whose height can be adjusted at the front wall of the shower stall. The BEST shower I've had in a hotel EVER! You can actually adjust the pressure high enough to get all the shampoo and conditioner out very quickly. You can also adjust the temperature of the water via actual numeric gauges on the handles (unfortunately only written in Farenheit, not Celsius). All the staff were very nice: when I walked through the front doors, at check-in, everytime I walked in or out of the hotel, at breakfast in the main restaurant adjacent to the main foyer. One down-side was that they wouldn't grant me a late check-out. I had brunch that morning with a friend, who showed up slightly late. So my plans to pack after brunch were going to be a bit hurried. I had for an extra 30 minutes, but unfortunately, they couldn't give it to me. I think it had to do with the Santa Claus parade going on that afternoon. I managed to check out just after noon with no penalties. So that was nice of them. Brunch buffet was on the better side of average for a hotel. Coffee and orange juice tasted fresh. There was lipstick on my coffee mug. Luckily I didn't wear any that morning so I could tell for certainty that it wasn't mine. They gave me a new mug immediately with a huge apology.

Note the location of the Starbucks because you get free wifi access, which you don't get for free in the hotel room! 2) the showers and the water pressure level 3) the panoramic view elevators (I only managed to ride it once during my stay, but it was enough). 4) the $7 cab ride from Union Station (train), the 2 minute walk to Queen St cars and subway stations!

The executive level room is adequate but no minibar, and decorated -- inexplicably -- in an early 80's orange-brown. The room is dark and cold when I arrive, like they weren't expecting me.

Here are the pros: The room was 2921 on the executive floor, and it was clean, modern, bright and spacious. The bed was nice and firm, and the pillows were comfortable. The coffee machine was good. We were able to see parts of the CN Tower, just that the weather didn't corporate during our stay. We were at the end of the hallway, so it was very quiet. Location of the hotel was convenient too. Few complaints here. We had initially requested a double bed non-smoking room. They ran out of the double bed rooms, so we were given a non-smoking king bedroom instead. The front desk was friendly, and promised to bring us a cot bed, but unfortunately it never came. A bit disappointed, but since it was only one night, we didn't bother requesting again. Amenities were basic. There were only 2 sets of towels, we ended up calling room service for more towels. There were no bathroom fans. Also no bottled water, no mini-fridge, no wi-fi, no newspaper outside our door in the morning. The biggest problem was parking. We parked at the gargage at night just right beside the hotel entrance on Richmond Street. The gargage inside was extremely dark at night, may be they were trying to conserve power or something so they dimmed the lights, it was very difficult and dangerous to drive down there. We had a hard time looking for elevators to come back up the street level. We ended up getting our way out of the garage at the back of the hotel alley. It was late at night and we felt extremely unsafe. After checkout on the next day, we tried many ways to go back down the parking level where we parked our car, walking up and down the stairs, including the suggestions from the help desk, still not successful. We ended up finding our car back after one hour, carrying our luggages, following the exact driving route as we did the night before, except ON FOOT! It was simply the worst indoor parking lot experience I have ever had! The parking elevator inside the hotel simply could not get us down the same location as we parked. Initially we thought it would be the most convent to park right beside the hotel, apparently it's not the case. You would better off parking your car at Green P right beside the City Hall!

The location is great! Its within 3 blocks from Front street and nearby Rogers Centre. It is also fairly close to Dundas Square. The hotel itself is very welcoming. The lobby is beautiful and well decorated. The one drawback of this hotel is the elevators. During the time we stayed 2 elevators were down for repair. I had only known this because I checked the website before hand. No one told me this at the hotel, nor did they have any sings posted. Other guests seemed very upset about this. On the day of check out-which is 12, we waited for 20 minutes for an elevator. Since we were ont he 10th floor, every elevator that stopped was full. We ended up carrying two large suitcases and a cooler down 10 flights of stairs because we were tired of waiting. Then, our next hurdle was the parking garage. Again, there was only one elevator working and for some reason the stairs were locked. We then decided not to wait in line and go down the car ramp into the parking garage. This was extremely anoying. Parking is also very expensive- $32 for the weekend. The room itself was clean but the decor could use some updating. The bed is extremely comfortable. The staff is also friendly too. The pool is great because you can swim inside and out. However, I was surprised to see so many people at the pool during the day. A chair is really hard to come by. We tended to use it in the evening just before close. It also closes at 11pm which I felt it should be open 24 hrs. We did not eat in the restaurants because from looking at the menus, they were way out of our price range. There is a fantastic little diner about 3 blocks from the hotel and breakfast is under 10$.

The hotel is well located, which I would say is it's main selling point. I usually use Priceline or Hotwire, but was travelling with someone who really wanted a smoking room, so we booked directly with the hotel. To my surprise none was available despite being assure upon making the reservation weeks prior to arrival. So essentially I received what i would have gotten on Priceline or Hotwire, but at twice the price. We were told the room would be available the next night, which it was, the hotel staff was very efficient moving our belongings to our requested room while we were out for the day. Nothing was offered for the inconveince (ie: internet in our room, or a breakfast). 1st room was on the 13th floor, very typical room, with need of an update. 2nd room (#1518) was much the same, but needed the update quite a bit more. I understand hotels do not feel the need to keep the smoking rooms in AAA shape, but this rooms carpet was disgusting, giant stains in a couple of places.....I would have to say this would be the dirtiest carpet I have ever seen in a supposed 4 star hotel. I have stayed at many of Toronto's 4* hotels..(Inter-Continental, Royal York, Sheraton, Westin HC) and stay in smoking rooms about 50% of the time.......and as I said, most need an update on the furniture, and can understand not wanting to invest too much in these stinky rooms....but this carpet was dirty...not just old. As well, the beds in the smoking rooms were inferior to those in the non-smoking room. They also had problems with their elevators, the sceinic ones were not working all weekend, and on Sunday morning, upon checkout, the 3 remaining ones (yes there were lineups) would not let you out in the lobby, only the pool area, so you had to carry your bags down 2 flights of stairs to get to the lobby. I have stayed right across the street at the Sheraton many times, would have to say it is a much nicer and efficeint hotel, despite being a much busier place. My one other pet peeve about the place is none of the rooms have windows that open, so if you are stuck in a smoking room...and you don't smoke, you get no fresh air at all. and even if you do not have a smoking room, it's always nice to have some fresh air as opposed to the same recycled air in the room all the time, I would give the Hilton a definate miss on my next visit, as a matter a fact, I would have been disappointed if I would have gotten the place at half the price on Priceline or Hotwire...let alone paying full price!

Nice stay at the Hilton\u201d", "Author": "rebel1", "ReviewID": "UR73980649", "Content": "As someone who used to go to the University of Toronto, I lived for a number of years in the downtown core. I've returned regularly both on business and leisure and have had the opportunity to stay in several of downtown Toronto's hotels. This was my first stay at the Hilton Toronto and it did not disappoint. I had booked the trip through a discount online 3rd party and received an excellent rate. Having done this before, I have stayed at some of downtown's 4-star hotels only to find the hotel would place you in the worse possible, outdated, in-need-of-repair room (ahem, Sutton Place...), even if there was vacancy in the hotel. After confirming that I was booked at the Hilton, I read the reviews here on TripAdvisor, which were generally positive. I also noticed that the Hilton's manager regularly replied to people's reviews of the hotel. This was encouraging as it does show his concern for his guests and people's opinion of his hotel - something any potential guest should find commendable. Upon arriving, one first notices the lobby area is very nice - worthy of what one would expect from the Hilton brand. Check-in was effortless. Parking is below ground at $30/night (this is the usual high cost of parking in any downtown Toronto hotel) with in/out privileges. The parking is public (ie. not exclusive to the Hilton) however the elevator connects to just outside the Hilton's inside entrance from the surrounding Adelaide building. Location of the hotel is great and connects directly to the PATH (an underground downtown walkway interconnecting much of Toronto's core). We received a renovated room on the 7th floor that was very nice and spacious. Bed was very comfortable - something my wife really appreciated as she rarely finds hotel beds to be back-friendly. Room also had wired ethernet and a programmable safe. Others here have noted the lack of WIFI, which was a little disappointing but truly a minor detail. I frequently stay at the Hilton's Garden Inn chain when on business, and WIFI is available there. Mind you, the Garden Inn is more geared to the business traveler, who presumably would be more inclined to make use of the WIFI. We had one slight noise problem with another guest down the hall, who apparently was celebrating a birthday with about 30 friends. The celebration, guests and noise extended into the hallway and into the wee morning hours. However, the hotel staff acted quickly when they were made aware of the problem and quickly put a stop to the hallway festivities. The only other small issue we had was that there were carpet cleaners running noisy machines at midnight. Looked like an external company performing regular cleaning, but would have been nice if they didn't do it at midnight when people were trying to sleep. All in all, I found the Hilton to be one of the better hotels I've stayed at in downtown Toronto. We've stayed at the Sheraton Centre, King Edward, Sutton Place, Westin Harbour Castle, Delta Chelsea, One King West, Renaissance (Rogers Centre) to name a few, and I'd have to rank the Hilton among the best we've stayed here.

In addition one day they didn't have towels ready until the evening. On the last day of our stay housekeeping neglected to leave any bath towels only 3 face cloths. I woke early the next morning to discover this and made a call to guest service. I told them that it was urgent because we had an early flight to make that morning. After 15 minutes the towels still had not arrived. So I made a second call. With the second call I said I wanted to make a formal complaint. Guest services told me that there are no more complaint cards left. An additional 10 minutes later the towels finally arrived. After receiving the towels and showering I began to blow dry my hair. Then the power went out. Consequently my husband could not shower in the dark bathroom. I called guest services again.

When we went there, no food was served. Only cookies! Wow! The next day, I came back after meeting at 9pm and went straight to the executive lounge, the male staff there said they only serve some appetizers from 5pm - 7pm but again we were not informed and caught by surprise!

Booked 2 rooms for myself, my spouse, and two friends. Overall, good choice for a downtown hotel and we had a pleasant stay. The location is fantastic if you are looking for a central hotel, close to shopping, attractions, and transit. LOCATION: Again this is a great location. Walking distance to Queen Street and Eaton's Centre shopping (about 20 min) and even closer to some of Toronto's biggest attractions (CN Tower, Skydome (I still can't call it the 'Rogers Centre'), Hockey Hall of Fame, Union Staion and AC Centre). Lots of nearby restaurants as well. Our room had a great view of the CN tower. PARKING: Definitely a plus for a downtown location. The Hilton has its own underground secure parking. The rates are very reasonable also. The rate on the hotel's website ($30) is a flat rate per day and useful if you will be in and out with your car during the day. If you are just parking and leaving your vehicle at the hotel (as we did) it is much cheaper to pay at the machine near the entrance to the parking garage then through your room. We arrived around 6 pm and left the next day at 1 pm and parking was only $16.50. Very good for this area. CHECK-IN: Went smoothly and we received the room preferences and bed preferences that I asked for when I booked. The staff at the check-in was my only complaint. STAFF: We encountered/spoke to very few staff members and for the most part there were no complaints. The only complaint I have (and where this hotel lost 'points' for me) was with the front desk staff. When we checked in they were not very friendly. I have stayed in a number of Hilton Hotels before and they always have the best staff. They usually go out of their way to help and be friendly. The staff member that checked us in was not very friendly, did not smile, etc. She wasn't 'rude' but not what I expected from a Hilton employee. I had a number of bags with me and was obviously have trouble and she did not offer to have someone help me bring the items up to my room. When the other 2 members of my party checked in about 30 min later they told me the same thing, that they found the front desk staff person unfriendly and said she was 'snobby'. It could be because we are young but I just expect more from Hilton. ROOM: Clean and updated. Nice view. Good water pressure. Good bed/bedding. Quiet and the a/c worked well. Only complaint: no fan in the bathroom so the mirror was always fogged up. ELEVATORS: I have seen a couple of reviews saying that if you don't like heights to avoid this hotel because they have glass elevators. I thought the glass elevators were really nice actually, and gave a wonderful view (especially at night). That being said, there are 6 guest elevators and only 3 are glass. If you really did not want to take a glass elevator you could just use the ones of the opposite side which are normal elevators.

Both suites appeared to be very dated (short of new headboards on the beds and a flat panel tv). The furniture had scratch marks , the ceiling in the shower had rust on it, the walls were marked up and peeling, the one suite had two large, what I think were, fuse boxes beside the bed, The one rooms numbers on the outside were falling off of the door and by the next day someone had taken one of the numbers and run off. Internet is not free and despite having a King Alcove Suite the rooms did not have a mini fridge. That costs extra!

Good things: - Excellent value as part of the package, really good on Hilton, Ontario Tourism and the other parties involved who made this possible. - Location was great. Right downtown, literally next to a subway station, walking distance from Union train/bus stations, lots of restaurants etc nearby. Easy walking distance to the Art Gallery of Ontario (where the exhibition was), as well as the Eaton Centre and many other places. Excellent location for exploring without having to use a car, which no one wants to do in downtown Toronto anyway. - Rooms were very clean, well-maintained, up-to-date and modern, just what you'd expect from Hilton - a nice size too. - Scenic elevators were a nice touch. - Restaurant (Tundra) was a little pricy, but the food was top-notch. Not your usual touristy bland hotel fare. No problem if there's bad weather, eating at the hotel is not a wasted meal. Bad things: - There were a lot of drunk, rowdy groups of teenagers/college students on our floor, coming from/going to bars until 4am, yelling from room to room as though it was a dorm, banging on the walls, generally being jackasses (why are people like this in big groups?). Couldn't sleep, and judging from other patrons on the floor yelling things like \"why can't you respect the peace\", a lot of other people couldn't as well. Staff dealt with it pretty well (they gave us another room the next day, higher up, with no problems), but there was the attitude that \"it's Saturday night so we can't really do anything about the noise\". The other nights we stayed were fine, just wish that more could have been done during the night itself, as the next morning was pretty much a waste for us (had to sleep in!). - The hotel was pretty noisy in general, perhaps because of its age? Could hear pipes rattling occasionally, soundproofing wasn't great i.e. could hear people walking/talking in the hallways, doors closing etc. Not a big deal once you get used to it, only noticeable at night. - If I'd paid the full room rate, I'd probably be a bit annoyed at having to pay an extra $15 for Internet access. You can choose e.g. to eat breakfast elsewhere if you want to save money, but realistically in this day and age not having Internet access really impacts your stay, e.g. needing to find maps, find restaurants/attractions (thanks, Tripadvisor!), so people have no real choice but to pay it. Having said that, the Internet access was generally reliable and pretty fast for a hotel. All in all, given what we paid, it was a very good stay. A bit noisy, but more than outweighed by the good things. Would maybe avoid Saturday nights next time.

The room was a typical hotel room - no frills, but nothing wrong with it either. It had comfortable beds, a TV that worked, it was clean. I booked through Hotwire, and got a very good rate of about $74. However, out of curiosity, I checked the rate directly with the Hilton web site and found that the normal rate was about double this. At $74, I have absolutely no complaints about the value of this room. However, I don't think it would be worth double that. It is listed as a 4 star hotel, but I feel it lacks the \"specialness\" to earn that 4th star - I would rate it a good 3, perhaps 3.5. The hotel has a couple of restaurants which look good, however being in downtown Toronto, we chose to chose to seek out specific types of food elsewhere, therefore I can't comment on the in-hotel restaurants (but can say that within a 10 minute walk, there is literally every type of food in existence).", "Date": "March 18, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chandler, AZ", "Title": "\u201cVery clean, up to date hotel\u201d", "Author": "billsinaz", "ReviewID": "UR58573514", "Content": "My company rate made this hotel a bargain.

The trip is only one hour and fifteen minutes away and yet you feel like you are in a different country when you go to the Hilton Toronto. I first was greeted by Suzanna who checked me in and welcomed me there. She told me anything I needed and wanted to make my trip enjoyable let her know. We talked a little afterwards after she checked me in. She made certain that I knew what my trip included. While I was out of my room for maybe twenty minutes to my pleasant surprise I had a bottle of champagne of ice and a cheese and fruit tray big enough for three people to eat off of. A card with my completed name on it says Welcome to Hilton Toronto, Enjoy the exhibit and your stay and wake like an Egyptian, Cordially, Edwin. The King Tut was very easy to get to and a real interesting exhibit. The Hilton Toronto was outstanding! The rooms were clean and so comfortable. My favorite part was definitely the executive lounge. There I met Jim, one of Hilton's employees. That guy went out of his way to make certain I was enjoying that executive lounge. On that Monday, March 1, 2010 I met Annette. This is truly someone you should know. Annette kept in touch with me from my getting there and my leaving. Everything was so organized for my trip. I would definitely, recommend anyone or ones that want the royal treatment goes to this place and your life will never be the same. By the way, Susan you help me to by telling me call the hotel and tell them about my needing more time to correct my passport book and just as you said I was accommodated to the highest.

We came back as we were booked in advance for New Years Eve King Tut package and had a fabulous time! What a difference. It's really sad though one has to complain to get the service one deserves. Well lets start this magnificent experience. The room - upgraded! I'm sure thanks to Jason! Beautiful! We did assume with New Years it was going to be noisey and sure it was but it was because we had a whining baby and two youngins in the room next to us! For the most of the night you could hear one child yelling karate moves Hiiiiiiiyaaaaa redundantly! We went to Nathan Phillips Square and when we got back around 1230pm the child was still Hiyaaaaing! I thought I was going to be awaken the next morning to that....surprisingly I think we were up before the family next to us! Thankfullly! Also, when we returned from our dinner we observed cheese, crackers and a bottle of Vosse water in our room! I don't know if everyone got this but it sure did make us feel good about coming back! Jason really took care of us and I'm very grateful for that. There was one thing we found gross but didn't complain because the good outwayed the bad:) something sticky on the surface of the granite countertop above the mini fridge! Not sure what this was but it wasn't from us. Oh ya, the body lotion in our bathroom was open and appeared used so I asked housekeeping for a couple on our way back from the pool, which needs renovating! If it weren't for jason I don't believe this hotel would have much else to offer in the way of service. He gets r done! Thank you and because of you Jason we may just return. I've noted from previous reviews Jason appears a lot....maybe the hotel GM should take this into account give the guy a promotion or even a raise. He definitely stands by the Hilton name! When I first saw the GM respond to all the reviews I thought it was a nice touch....now I see it's all just a charade! I did exactly as he said to do and it didn't happen! Like I said jason got r done!!! Restaurant in HIlton- King Tut packages including dinner is a set menu! Mainly consisting of apple infused something however the supervisor tried his best to be accomodating! I surprised myself and found dinner enjoyable.

Having driven down from Upper Canada \u00e2\u20ac\u201c for the last part along an extremely busy Yonge Street \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we arrived at the hotel to find helpful bell and valet staff. Upgraded to a junior suite on the 28th floor at checkin by a less than friendly staff member. The suite was certainly pleasantly large with a great views of Lake Ontario, the CN tower, and the city; and just 15 minutes from the Convention Center. (The hotel is also easily walkable from Union station, which is where we dropped off our rental car.) Although fairly spacious, however, the room was short of closet and drawer space: only 2 drawers and no bedside cabinets \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which was a problem, since we had extra clothes for sightseeing. Inexplicably, there was space enough for drawers beneath the TV, but the space was inaccessible. Apart from the fairly large desk, the room also has few surfaces. Complimentary wifi was provided in the room as well as in the very spacious executive lounge on the 32nd floor. The usual Hilton continental breakfast and late afternoon hors d\u00e2\u20ac\u2122oeuvres were also available in the executive lounge. However, there were often too few staff in the lounge and both the breakfast and hors d\u00e2\u20ac\u2122oeuvres ran out and was not replenished until requested. (When we drew the exec lounge manager\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attention to the problem, she fixed the problem.) One of the really nice features about this hotel, apart from its central location, is the excellent swimming pool (which has an internal and an external part). The water is wonderfully warm and it is large enough to swim. There is also a large area with sun loungers. Again, however, staff are either in short supply or nonexistent, and the towels ran out on a couple of occasions. For the tourist, there are also plenty of OK restaurants on nearby King Street, although you need to be careful which you choose: the Indian 309 Dhaba Excellence is OK to good, Le Saint Tropez is also OK, as is the less expensive Quizno\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s (Wellington Street). However, the NOT inexpensive Il Fornello at 214 King should be avoided; if you want something better, try the very good Portuguese seafood restaurant, Adega, on Elm Street, a few blocks uptown. For something even better, take a 20-minute cab ride to Il Molino on Eglinton Avenue West for a really great Italian (albeit pretty expensive) restaurant.

It is close to bars, restaurants, and the mall. Inside the hotel was nice. The room was comfy and the bed was extremely comfortable! The issue with this hotel is that the parking garage is a public garage. You also have to pay and absurd fee to take your car in and out of the garage. You have to pay every time you leave and come back. Luckily, everything is within walking distance so we decided to pay the one time fee. This means if you keep the car in the garage without taking it out, you just pay a fee of just $30 I believe for the entire weekend. Our car was there from 4am on Friday until Sunday. On Saturday morning, I got a very disturbing phone call from the hotel manager informing me that my rental car was broken into! Apparently, the person that broke in the car tried to steal the GPS that was mounted into the rental car. However, the crook was unsuccessful. There was glass all over the place. He/She did steal my car keys and house keys for god knows what reason since they would be no good to the crook since I live in New York. I guess I should have taken everything out of the car. I did not think it would be a concern. He crook didn't bother to take some expensive cologne, giorgio armani and expensive shades, ray bans and dior. I dont get it! On that same day, 7 other cars were broken into as well!!! Later, we learned, from one of the restaurant employees and the toronto police, that this public garage has been one of the main targets for theft in Toronto! This public garage has no cameras what so ever and only one or two security checks during the night, which was how it was discovered my rental was broken into. ARE YOU SERIOUS?!?! Thankfully, I decided to get insurance on the car, which was something I have never done before on any rental car in the past and I have driven to Mexico and Canada before too! I was able to drive to the Toronto airport and exchange the car without any issues. I must say kudos the manager for he took great care of us. He was extremely apologetic and very sincere! He almost made me feel sorry he was put in the position of telling me about the incident. The had a nice bottle of wine, cheese, crackers and fruit sent to our room. He paid for breakfast in their hotel restaurant and free dinner with anything we wanted from the menu. He also waved the hotel parking garage fee from the bill. He also allowed me to park the new rental car in the pick up and drop off area directly in front of the hotel along with 7 other cars that were broken into. It was crazy seeing all these cars parked there with busted out windows and a clear plastic tarp and tape for a replacement. I had no intentions of eating at the hotel for I know hotel food could be expensive, but since we didnt pay for it was great! Since we had the unfortunate incident of having our rental car broken into, I had to give this place an average rating. That made a huge difference! Otherwise, I didnt have a problem with this place.

What's pretty hard to ignore though is the very low level of bell service. Upon check-in, after spending minutes of waiting in front of the (otherwise empty) entrance, we decided to load a trolley ourselves, which finally prompted someone to show up. After check-in, we again couldn't find anyone to help with the luggage (front desk didn't seem too concerned about it either, although the lobby was practically empty) so we had to take the trolley to the room ourselves. Again, not a problem, although somewhat unusual in Hiltons. Upon checkout, I had to wait some 20 minutes for the bellman to show up (my wife was already downstairs: she later noted that she had seen plenty of bellmen chitchatting at the entrance, and zero guests checking in our out) - then another bellman, who helped to push the trolley out to the car, reminded me to tip... I found this rather distasteful: I would never forget to tip a bellman, but I prefer to keep it my own prerogative as to when I do it, and how much I give.

We relied a lot of Trip Advisor before our trip, so we thought we would give our best assessment of the Hilton Toronto. The Hilton Toronto's location could not be better We were a 15 minute walk from any destination in downtown Toronto. We loved it! The subway was a block away when we needed to take it to far away destinations like the Royal Ontario Museum and Casa Loma. The desk and staff was very helpful. Check-in was a breeze and several times we asked the hotel staff for directions and they were always helpful to point us in the right direction (We never used the concierge as they never seemed to be in when we needed directions.) We had a king room with a great view of University Avenue. The maid staff was timely and everything in the room was clean. We were on the 6th floor, so I suspect this is one of the newly renovated rooms. With the king bed and all our luggage, the room was a tight fit. At times it was a bit frustrating moving around a smaller hotel room. The bathroom and showers were adequate for our needs. The hotel has a great pool/hot tub area. We utilized this nearly every night. The pool is an indoor/outdoor pool where you can swim between locations. There were always clean towels available. Another neat feature is the \"scenic elevators\" where the glass opens out to a view of the city...the CN Tower looks great at night. We took it up to the 32nd floor to get a full-city view. The hotel is also connected to the PATH--Toronto's underground walkways. This proved very beneficial when we were caught on the harborfront as a thunderstorm blew in. We were able to walk from Union Station to the hotel indoors. I would imagine the PATH is a great benefit in the winter. We did not eat at a hotel restaurant nor did we need to park a car, so I can't offer advice on any of these services. Internet service cost $15/day. They really nickel and dime you on this one.

I stayed three times at this Hilton, once in November 2008 and twice this past June (2009) and received a different level of service every time. Since the fall review might not be as accurate of the current situation, I'll based my comments on the last two stays in June. GENERAL COMMENTS: Overall, the Hilton Toronto is centrally located on Richmond, across pretty much from City Hall and an easy walking distance to the Eaton Centre. Even though it is a large hotel (602 rooms), it certainly feels more human in size than the massive Sheraton Centre situated diagonally across or the Delta Chelsea for that matter (both 1000+ room hotels) and the d\u00c3\u00a9cor in the public areas and rooms is more modern in style. Unlike some reviewers, I don't mind not having Valet Parking as I'd much rather park my car myself but it's pretty pathetic a city centre Hilton hotel would not provide such a service for those who want to use it. Parking is cheap on week-ends at the attached public garage (9$ a day). Service levels have been consistently declining (valet parking included, they just took it away) ever since Hilton Corporation, which used to own their city properties in Canada (Hilton Toronto, Toronto Airport, Montreal Bonaventure and Quebec City), sold them to Westmount Hospitality (same could be said about the one in Quebec city which is suffering service-wise compared to before the takeover by Westmount). Even some employees which I met during my two last stays (and I won't name which department they worked for no to put them in trouble) commented on how the recession excuse was being used to cut just about everything, including Air con in the staff's rest area (and I'm not trying to make this just an entertaining read but... on my second stay, it looks like they were trying to save on air conditionning in the lobby too, it was quite stuffy - Just try and go up to the meeting area where you have a few computers, that place has probably not seen air circulation since the last time they changed the carpet in 1999). That's pretty low from an employer to me and I can understand where the low morale comes from if that's an indication of how they treat their people. I'm one to believe in the saying \"treat your staff well like family, and they will treat your customers the same way\". Unfortunately, it looks like the bean counters at this Hilton forgot that saying when they walked in their classes at business school. STAFF: I think I covered up a bit in my general comments how the staff is at this hotel. Most, if you're kind to them, will be equally kind to you. Unfortunately, even though I appreciate them trying to be friendly, it shouldn't take 3 calls (including one to the duty manager) to get a room cleaned properly. Some on here have noticed communication seems to fail between departments at this hotel. I wholeheartdly agree. Sometimes, it also just depends on the employee. I wanted to book another Hilton hotel in the business center. This employee at the front desk told me to go use the business centre. When I inquired as if they had a free link to the Hilton website, she said, \"no, you'll need to pay for it\". Wait a minute? I want to book a stay again in the chain and you're going to make me pay for the privilege? That's a first in a Hilton. Fortunately, a more proactive staff member suggested I go use the meeting area business center where access for a few minutes would be free. During my first stay in June, I got asked checking-in if I wanted 2 double beds or a king. Well... I had booked 2 double beds for a reason so I was curious as to why I was being asked. She said that a lot of people booked 2 beds not really consciously through third party websites... I booked with HHonors on the website, I don't think this qualifies as third party. Regardless, I was upgraded to the executive floor which was useless since the lounge is closed on week-ends. Tip: If this happens to you, refuse the upgrade, the standard rooms on the lower floors and the Deluxe rooms on floors 20-24 are a lot nicer and more recently remodeled. ROOMS and FACILITIES: Rooms, just like the service and housekeeping, are usually inconsistent. Lower floor rooms (15 and below) were renovated less than a year ago and are very spacious, nice and new. Floors 16 to 23 are to be avoided as just when the elevator doors open, you will smell the older, stuffy hallways. This extends to the room also. Deluxe rooms are also very nice and some have rainshowers which is excellent. Executive level rooms are alright, I'd say not as bad as the unrenovated standard rooms but definately a notch below the deluxe and renovated standard. The only difference is that you get the top floors, lounge access and free water. I also found the mattress more comfortable in those rooms, the new ones in the renovated rooms gave the two of us a mix of back/neck pain in the morning. Housekeeping is this hotel's biggest weakness. On the stay back in Nov '08, the room clealiness could have been better but I brushed it off and didn't call. First stay in June, clean room, nothing to report. Third stay... where to start. Walked in the room. Noticed bread or some sort of muffin crumbs from previous guest on the carpet and it was all over the work desk. Work desk was also sticky (soft drink leftovers?) and had clearly not been cleaned. An elastic was just by the window on the carpet (again, no girls in the party so couldn't be ours). I decided to lift up the bed cover to discover small curly hairs. Make-up mirror light in bathroom burned. Alarm clock dimmer light burned so impossible to see anything when it was dimly lit or dark in the room. It took, as mentioned, three phone calls to get it resolved. The first time, we waited 30 min. for someone to come up, decided to go to the pool and comeback. An hour later, no one had been there. Called again, they changed the sheets (even though I had mentioned the crumbs and sitcky desk) but didn't clean the rest. Third call, I was promised the housekeeping in-charge. They did send someone who did a great job but failed to send their in-charge. To compensate, breakfast vouchers were offered with an apology so overall, they did the right thing but I would have rather had a clean room with functional appliances to start with. Facilities are overall very good. The hallway on our floor was not air conditioned and warm (some random girls we spoke to on the elevator noticed the same, cost-cutting measures???). The pool area is large and well-maintained with nice loungers. The entryway could have been cleaner. Tundra restaurant served an excellent buffet breakfast with lots of choices but absolutely not worth the 23$ (if my memory serves me right) price tag. You can go to Milestone's for an equally good brunch for 30-40% less. At 16-17$, their buffet would be good value but over 20$, that's just a rip-off in a city so full of breakfast options. The restaurant staff was very kind and cheerful, I will give them that! Internet access and local calls are included in Deluxe and executive rooms. Watch your check out slip as I had been charged local calls in a Deluxe room while it said they were free on Hilton's own website. Brought it to the attention of the agent at night and he said local calls were not free in deluxe rooms. The agent at check-out the next day said the opposite and told me her colleague was misinformed. BOTTOM LINE: With the central location, fairly spacious rooms with really nice d\u00c3\u00a9cor and a relaxing pool area in the summer (open year-round!), this could be such a nice Hilton. They seem to treat HHonors members fairly well also (I was satisfied with respect to them taking into accound floor and room location preference in my profile). It's really too bad poor management, staff training and housekeeping let it slip consistently. Hopefully, someone will wake up soon and smell the coffee but I won't be in rush to go back to check it out, unless the rates remain competitive (they have been fairly low recently and are frankly, not worth more than 130-140$ a night), then I might consider it and I'll let you judge if you should do so too. This is why I rate it as an \"average\" hotel overall with very inconsistent service.", "Date": "July 25, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rochester, NY", "Title": "\u201cVery pleasant, quiet, relaxing stay.

The hotel benefits from being centrally located downtown with two good restaurant selections, Chris Ruth & Tuscani. Lobby bar and conference rooms are well maintained and not worn out. Enough dining selections so you don't have to use room service. While most of the software in terms of TVs and furniture is new, there were some chipping in the drawer cabinets.

The room -- a standard with a King bed -- was pretty much as you'd expect -- but it was very large and the furniture, quite modern. Gone was the old TV armoir -- and in its place, a sleek and long bureau. The bathroom was standard, though with a slightly larger bathtub -- and all was very , very clean. We didn't eat in the restaurant, but had drinks in the bar -- and received great service. I swam in the pool, soaked in the nice jacuzzi, and spent some time in the sauna. All very clean and surprisingly quiet. The pool was great -- indoor, but with a little swimming canal to take you outside. It isn't the funkiest neigborhood in Toronto. You are in the heart of the financial district -- lots of big banks, and insurance companies abound. But it's easy to get around and there's still no shortage of things to see and walk to within 20 minutes, including ample shopping. All in all -- the Toronto Hilton was just what the doctor ordered.

The women I spoke with in Reservations said that yes, it was noted about the dogs. She said there was a $50 refundable DEPOSIT for the dogs to stay in the room. I asked if the room had a refrigerated minibar as one of my dogs takes a liquid prescription medication twice a day. She said the room did not have a minibar, but she would put in a request for a refrigerator. I checked into the hotel about 5 pm on Saturday 10/18. I was told there were no refrigerators available (so glad I called ahead!). I said what about putting me in a room with a minibar? No, those are only on the Executive Floors and dogs aren't allowed on those floors. Finally the Manager came up with the option of keeping the medication in the refrigerator at the Front Desk area. That was acceptable. Then, I was told it was not a deposit for the dogs, but a FEE. Oh, and the fee was no longer $50, but had recently gone up to $75. Then the front desk clerk stated she wasn't sure if the FEE was per room or per dog. Hmmm. Let's see, from a customer expectation of $50 deposit (refundable) to $75 fee x 3 dogs =$225. For my \"FREE\" room. I told her if the fee was per dog then I was walking out the door. The Manager then compromised by charging me \"only\" $50 (plus taxes, of course!) The next time I want to travel with my dogs, I will be sure to seek out a truly pet-friendly chain such as Starwood. As for the room, it was well appointed, clean and spacious.

The location was great, the concierge and desk clerks were helpful and I felt comfortable walking by myself in the surrounding neighborhood. When I arrived back at the hotel from attending a Saturday evening concert at Massey Hall that let out around 11 p.m., two employees were stationed in front of the elevator to make sure anyone going near that area had a room key. That gave me a secure feeling as well. It took around 12-15 minutes to walk to Massey Hall and was very easy and safe to do alone. Also, there were some decent places to eat along the way along with great places to shop. While I could have gotten a much better deal on the room (start your bids at $80 on priceline and go up from there), it was still a good value. I called a day before my arrival and requested one of the renovated rooms on one of the higher floors and the staff kindly accommodated me. I felt very lucky! The room was spacious, modern clean and nicely appointed, and the bed felt heavenly and comforting after a long day. It definitely felt like a business traveler's room, but I liked it and it beautifully served my needs. The only complaint is that the bathroom smelled musty/mildewy even though on the surface it looked clean. Since my stay was brief, I chose to overlook this. I enjoyed riding the elevator with the outdoor view. Parking was easy as well and yes, it was a bit expensive, but very convenient, so no complaints! The biggest hassle was getting into downtown. The Gardiner Expressway was closed so what should have taken 10 minutes by car took an hour. Be smart and call ahead to ask about road construction, closings, etc. Also, while there, many streets were closed due to a movie being filmed near the hotel. This complicated getting to the hotel as much as the Gardiner Expressway being closed. While the filming was probably an unusual occurrence, it would have been good to know about this in advance. The next day for breakfast I decided to splurge and eat at Tundra--one of the restaurants at the Hilton--because I liked the modern decor and because I had an enjoyable breakfast there once before. Again, it's a bit costly, but the convenience and quality is worth it. For $23 (CAD) plus tax, the buffet, which has many choices, such as eggs benedict, pea meal bacon, fresh fruit and wide selection of breads/muffins, also includes tea and juice. There seem to be plenty of other nice places to eat in the area with much lower prices, so you definitely have options.

Self-parking is underground, and easy to find. The weekend parking rate was very reasonable -- it cost us $18/night to park. Check-in was quick and staff was friendly. We stayed in a junior suite. The suite was very spacious, and clean. There was even a couple bottles of spring water and a snack compliments of the hotel. The decor is modern -- almost had a 'boutique hotel' feel to it. The king bed was fabulous (nice and soft)! For those on a business trip, there is a work area with a work desk and phone/internet connection. Very simple. The bathroom is clean, and the water pressure in the shower was nice and strong. While we loved the room and hotel in general, we did have a few things that we were disappointed with. If you're a light sleeper (unfortunately, my boyfriend is one), I would highly suggest you choose your room as far from the elevators as possible. Our room was closest to the bank of elevators, and the traffic from people walking to/from elevators can be very noisy. It is also closest to the ice machine, so we can hear the dispenser releasing ice at all hours. Also, we could hear the sirens (possibly ambulance/cruisers) from the streets below quite clearly (we were on the 20th floor and we thought the windows would have been sound proofed from street noise) so that was very disruptive from having a good night sleep. Between the noise from the hallway/ice dispenser and from the streets below, it could be a deal breaker for those looking for some R&R. We had access to the Executive Lounge, which offers complimentary beverages (nice selection of wines and liquor, as well as non-alcoholic drinks) and continental breakfast. The breakfast selection was limited and a bit disappointing, but it's good for those looking for a quick bite to go with their tea/coffee (I've seen better at Hyatt/Fairmont). The lounge has a couple of desktops with internet access. It is a nice area to unwind at night because its on the 32nd floor, so it offers a panoramic view of the city.

We haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t traveled that much but we have stayed at an arrangement of hotels. Given that I got these rooms through Hotwire I was happy but if I would have paid full price I would have been upset because of the clientele that was there. Check in was smooth and very easy. This was my first time using hotwire so I was a little nervous about how it would go; we had no problem at all. When we arrived in the rooms they were very clean and we had a room facing the CN Tower and the pool. The beds were comfortable and rooms were a nice size. As we were traveling with someone in a wheelchair and another person with down syndrome this was appreciated to have such a nice view so that if we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get out as much it was just nice staying in. There was a small hole in the wall which we called about and they offered to switch rooms however we had the only adjoining rooms left so we told them we were fine we just wanted to make them aware of it so we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get charged. The showers in the room are POWERFUL! I also really liked the toiletries; they were Crabtree and Evelyn, and the smell was very refreshing (I still have to visit our local shop to buy some). I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like that you were charged for local calls, I thought that was unusual. It did seem like everything was extra (internet connection, phone call, etc). We ate at the Ruth Chris\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Steakhouse for dinner, that was outstanding, but pricey which I knew it was going to be. It did serve for a memorable meal since we were celebrating a special occasion. We ate at the Tundra for breakfast, and the food was outstanding there too. The fruit was especially fresh and everything was very tasty. The location of the hotel was convenient. I do recommend trying to find parking elsewhere if you can. Since we had someone in a wheelchair I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a problem with $30.00 a night for the parking, but there are plenty of other places that offer parking much cheaper. The pool area was adequate, half of the pool was outside and half inside which I thought was great!! The workout area was very small, but we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really use it. Our only big grip was the clientele that the Hilton had that weekend. On Friday we were next to a room full of young college kids that were partying, (they calmed down after the second time someone came up). Then on Saturday night some 30-40 year old men came up drunk and knocking on all the doors at 3 am. Sunday morning was really weird when there was a lady in the hot tub who was facing the jets and moving her breast around to have the jets target them, then she started positioning her legs as well. Luckily enough it was early and just myself and my sister-in-law (who has down syndrome) there, but we quickly left and went into the pool to give her some \u00e2\u20ac\u0153privacy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. My sister-in-law didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t notice and there weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t any children around but I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have expected that type of clientele from people staying at the Hilton. Its hard to fault a hotel for the people that stayed there because it could have been just a one time thing, however I would probably try to find a different place to stay next time so I have some place else in Toronto to compare it to (is it just the people that go to Toronto, or is it the Hilton??)

We arrived on Dec 30th, which probably helped in terms of room choice (the pickings might have been slimmer the following night, since the hotel filled up for New Years). Overall, the renovated rooms were nicely done (we particularly liked the comfortable bed and nice linen, the chaise lounge and the huge walk-in shower with rain shower head plus detachable showerhead). It does seem, though, as though whoever oversaw the renovation skimped on a few things (e.g. flimsy curtains that add nothing in terms of decor) and didn't oversee the details of the work done (lots of splashed paint blobs, some poorly finished elements). The Melitta coffeemaker in the room makes terrible coffee. Since we know the area well (ordinarily, we live in Toronto - this was a trip home for us), we knew where to find good meals elsewhere. However, the one \"meal\" we did eat at the hotel at midnight after we arrived at the hotel (quesadillas in the Barristers Bar) was surprisingly good, and the service was fast and friendly. The old books in the lounge (a mix of law books and other books) are entertaining (well, not the revised Ontario Statutes, but the old romance novels are a hoot). The only negative experience we had was the succession of fire alarms on New Year's Eve - although hotel staff tried their best to handle the problem.

The bed was very uncomfortable and the towels were dirty. My wife noticed makeup on the hand towels. The carpet was very worn as well, in fact in the halls it is all bunched up with slack. The service was terrible. We called for extra pillows - noone ever showed up. Then we called for room service - Again, noone ever showed up. The executive lounge was way understaffed. You could not find a clean table to sit at. We ended up going to the restaurant for breakfast because they could not keep any food available in the lounge. We had a hard time getting anyone to wait on us downstairs in the Tundra restaurant. We ended up getting our breakfast off the buffet and then almost finished before we were asked if we wanted any juice or coffee. The location is good, of course so is the Sheraton Centre across the road which is so much nicer.

Ninety minutes to Niagra Falls, so that was a great side trip as well. Toronto Zoo is HUGE! Canada's Wonderland is similar to Six Flags and that is worth a trip as well.

Robert, the clerk, told us room not ready. Came back to front desk periodically over the course of an hour. Finally, told room still not ready but we were being assigned a room on 20th floor. Asked if this was executive floor. Told no double bedded rooms available on Executive floor. Ultimately assigned a room on 12th floor. Asked for access to executive lounge. Told not available. Offered to forgo upgrade and pay for a room on executive floor. After much key pounding and conferences in back room told no double bedded rooms available on executive floor. Asked to speak with manager. Manager arrived to tell us (a) no double bedded rooms available on executive floor and (b) executive lounge not made available to mere gold card members. The manager (\"Walter\") then said his paying customers would feel \"jilted\" (I'm not making this up) if they found the lounge crowded with people who had been upgraded. Went to our room(very utilitarian with a mattress having all the comfort of what my son reffered to as thin sliced salami) called HHonors and was told that there were multiple double bedded rooms available on executive floor. Only when confronted with this information and a threat to make a phone reservation with HHonors did \"Walter\" agree to let us purchase a room on executive floor...but no upgrades. I hate being lied to. I would go out of my way to not stay here again. The good news?? Ritz Carlton is allegedly opening a facility in Toronto in the very near future. On a final note, the valet parking would not park our car because it was a Yukon and then, when told that the concierge had indicated that the front desk would stamp our parking ticket for free parking, Robert on the front desk stated that the concierge was \"mistaken\".
