It must be the motel's proactive approach in pushing customers to write reviews, ie.emailing a link, signs posted at front desk, etc. I travel very often and use tripadvisor each time for reviews before booking. When i see a \"top 10\" on the list within a city, i assume it must be great. This is a basic motel, so I just want to warn off anyone looking for an ideal hotel or a great bargain for a trip to Phoenix - this is not it! If you need an inexpensive 1 - 2 night stopover, then this would work. OR if you are a budget traveller, this place is probably the better of those in its price range. We were here for a one night stopover due to full flights - needed a budget place to sleep with easy access to airport. The motel was fine for this. CONS....The immediate location was probably the biggest drawback for me - the area is not very nice/not appealing and i would not walk alone here at night. If you walk about 6-7 blocks towards chase field/US airways centre, the area gets much nicer. Also, we arrived late and hungry, but the only restaurant nearby was McDonalds! You need to walk about 15min to find better, which is fine if you have time and feel safe in that neighbourhood. The few blocks either side of the motel on Van Buren is a bit sketchy. A couple other minor drawbacks are a Queen instead of King bed and the rooms are very small, more like European size than American. Oh and our bathroom had some mould/mildew and walls needed a clean....These points did not bother us, but would be too small if you were spending more than a couple nights. PROS....On the plus side, Bed was comfy, pillows OK, sheets were clean, and new-ish flat screen tv. The free internet was a good feature and they might do a free breakfast? Another perk was the 24hr free airport shuttle service or free parking if you need it. The shuttle worked very conveniently for us, although I'd recommend they provide a 1-800 shuttle number with booking confirmation or better yet, add their motel to the \"hotel board/shuttles phones\" at the arrival section in the airport (This motel seemed to be one of the few that did not have a listing on those free phones which direct access to hotel reservations and shuttle service). The sink area was good and clean, perhaps new/recently remodeled. It's also nice that they include a fridge and a microwave, although no coffee maker/tea. I didn't notice road noise, but i sleep with earplugs, so can't comment on that - we did not hear anyone adjacent/above us, so hopefully this means good soundproofing! (but more likely we just got quiet neighbours that nite!!). Check-in was quick, but if they had more than 2 parties arrive at the same time, it would be akward (no lobby or waiting area). SUMMARY....To summ up, easy airport access, free internet, clean enough but the immediate area is not appealing with no restaurants/shops. Overall, i'd recommend staying here if you need a night or two with easy access to downtown/airport or if you are a budget traveller and want a decent place. If you are staying for a long weekend holiday or longer, then i'd pick one of the less expensive resorts in Scottsdale (ie. you can get a 4-star with pools for 75/nite).", "Date": "April 26, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Augusta, ME", "Title": "\u201cGood Downtown Stopover\u201d", "Author": "Gadfly1", "ReviewID": "UR128524979", "Content": "Clean and quiet downtown Phoenix motel.

We stayed 3 nights, checking in on Saturday and out on Tuesday. The hotel doesn't look overly impressive from the outside, but the inside and amenities and value completely won us over. This is a great place to stay on a budget if you can't afford the Hyatt right downtown. :-P The rooms really are newly-remodeled and look great inside -- new tile in the bathroom for the floor and shower, granite countertop for the sink area, new furniture in the room, large flat-screen tv, memory foam mattresses for the beds, etc. Our only complaint was that the bathroom door didn't quite shut all the way, but that was room-specific to our room. There's a mini fridge (no freezer in it) and a microwave, too. The a/c was fairly loud, especially while trying to sleep, but being in Phoenix (especially in summer) you're just grateful that it's working. :) Parking is free. Wifi is free (password was included on a card in the room). Continental breakfast was free, and although very basic was still nice to have. There were packaged muffins and pastries and granola bars, a bowl of fruit, and yogurt available in a little fridge in the lobby. They also had coffee, a pitcher of OJ, juice boxes, and bottles of water (definitely awesome). There's a McDonald's 1 block away if you want more easy breakfast options. The best part about this hotel is the value -- it's not the biggest, nicest, fanciest hotel around, but you will pay far less than anything else nearby and within walking distance of downtown. The first night of our stay was $69 and the second two nights were $89 each (jacked up due to the All-Star game, but still cheap comparatively). It's difficult to find anything less than mid-$100's elsewhere nearby. We walked into downtown every day, all the way to Chase Field from the hotel (just over a mile). It was fairly brutal in the July 100+ degree heat, but it's do-able and worth it to not have to pay for (and deal with) parking downtown. There's also a light rail station 4 blocks away from the hotel, so it's definitely an option to just walk to the light rail station and then take that anywhere else (Chase Field is 2 stops down from the closest one to the hotel -- $1.75 for a one-way ride, or $3.50 for an all-day pass). The convention center is even closer to the hotel than Chase Field, so getting there was an easier walk. Walking around in the winter would certainly be very pleasant, anyway. :) The hotel is kind of on the sketchy edge of town, but just barely on the border. It's not even sketchy, but just more run-down than the main downtown area. We never felt unsafe, even walking back to the hotel after 10pm sometimes. The staff was also quite friendly and nice -- the lobby where you check in (and get breakfast off the counter) is extremely tiny, but the guys checking you in were very nice. They even held onto a case of beer for us for the day we checked out while we went into town for the game, and we didn't want to leave the beer in the hot car all day long. They were nice about storing it in the back for us, and they didn't even drink any of it while watching it for us all day long. :-P It was an extra nicety that they did just because, not that they had to watch our stuff for us even after we checked out. All in all, it's a great value for your money, so if you can't afford the mid- to high-hundreds of dollars to stay somewhere fancy downtown, this is the place to be. You can still walk to everything, your room will be nice and new, and you can get free wifi and basic breakfast.

Apparently, management was aware of this but didn't do anything about it. The toilet wasn't completely attached to the floor so it tilted every time you sat. There was no alarm clock, hand lotion, pen or notepaper (pretty standard stuff, no matter how cheap the motel). The location is poor - it's just on the edge of a bad part of downtown, is surrounded by nothing but automotive garages, and is an 8 block walk to the nearest restaurant. I wasn't told the checkout time when I arrived or that there was a free contintental breakfast (which I had forgotten from when I booked) - but it consisted of orange kool aid and sugary pastries in a bag - the kind you find at gas stations, which never go bad because they're so full of chemicals and sugar. Room service was an ad for Domino's Pizza. To be fair, the wireless did work as advertised, the bed was comfortable, and other than the carpet, it seemed fairly clean.
