{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Overpriced GeneralThe reason we selected this hotel in Nov08 is that is very close to Menjangan Island and Secret Bay, probably THE best diving spots in Bali.Be aware that there's nowhere else to go nearby.If you look for peace and quiet it's fine, but you can't just stroll into town for a bite or shopping.Dive Centerlet's start with the good news, the dive center 5* PADI is well organised, friendly staff and excellent dive guides. Equipment is in good shape and boats comfortable and well maintained.You can order lunch from a menu every day for the trip ( 2 dives).Hotel LocationIt's called a Beach Resort, but the beach is about 20 m wide with one palm tree and 2 chairs.The premises are located at a harbour and adjacent to a mangrove forest.The lay out of the grounds, which are well kept, is huge. The bungalows are spread all over the compound and it may take a 5 minutes + walk to the restaurant at the harbour for food and drinks. There's no bar to speak of.There are 2 swimming pools that are filled with mineral water fro a local well.If you want to cool down you might be in for a surprise, the water is really realy warm.because of the mangrove nearby, this is the place to go if you like mosquito's.Rest assured, they will like you!!. They came in all sorts and sizes.be sure to bring enough repellant.RoomsBasic and more 3 star than 4 star. We paid about 95 USD in November and that was way overpriced for the location even for Bali standards. There was a small fridge, but it's empty. 2 complimentary bottles of mineral water each day.You get a smoking spiral against mosquito's each day as well.The rooms have airco and a good bed with mosquito netting (klambu).bathroom clean and basic. The shower provides ample amounts of water, but here again the water from the cold tap is hot as well.Restaurant and foodthe menu is limited but the food is good especially the local dishes.There's no bar to hang out so the restaurant is the place to be.Breakfast menu decent as well.ConclusionIt's overpriced and easier worth 35-45 USD than what we paid for it.If you are a dive nut and love mozzies it's worth a look.Us, we intended to stay longer but  drove the hell outta Dogde and relocated elsewhere.One more tip for those who do not use agents, get the mobile number of a taxi driver.There's not that much private transport around.", "Date": "Jan 11, 2009", "ReviewID": "UR155393135", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "1"}, "Author": "Super7NL"}, {"Content": "Disagree with past reviews       Beach just outside of hotel", "Date": "Apr 24, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR828443585", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "diveaar"}, {"Content": "Won't be back no way! This review comes a year late but hey I didn't know about trip advisor then!Anyhow, verdict is I won't go Mimpi 'Resort' Tulamben again simply because there's no genuine service and really nothing to attract me. There's no real beach-it's mostly rocks and black pebbles (some coarse black sand too) and painful to tread. The seaview rooms were also not worth the money. Food was nothing memorable. Whatever smiles we got were pretty forced and service was really non-existent. In fact, the staff looked pretty darn unhappy all the time-felt liked we owed them money or something!My husband was pretty ok with the diving at the Japanese wreck but that was it. The 'resort' really doesn't have a nice vibe to it. We couldn't even relax at the poolside because of the touts who kept wanting to sell us t-shirts and whatnot. It was, and still is, the only time I've been away with my husband on a diving trip and felt abandoned whenever he was off diving!Needless to say-we quit the moody place after 2 moody days and escaped to a humbler and cheaper resort in Sanur. Boy were we happy to be out of that grouchy unhappy place!!Final verdict-don't travel all the way to Tulamben unless you're really keen on the dive. Anyway, you get waters that are just as good at other parts of Bali, e.g. Amed. And really, you can find much better resorts ANYWHERE else!", "Date": "Jun 20, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR828859609", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "beachyogi"}, {"Content": "MMMMM Mimpi? Stayed at the sister resort in Feb 07, wanted to dive on the Tulamben wreck so booked this Mimpi and stayed from 20th to 24th May 2007. I booked with Asia Rooms and the price was cheap enough including breakfast at around 70 Sing dollars per night.The hotel was OK it did what was asked of it and that for me means they achieved my expectations but they did not exceed them. The hotel is in small but pleasant surroundings right on the beach although the hawkers were a bit irritating. In my experience in Indonesia over the last year of living there many businesses are in real need of a renovation. But either due to the poor numbers of tourists or the lack of willingness on the part of the hotels this has not always been done. Sadly this Mimpi is in need of a tidy up in the rooms (big damp patches on walls, loose tiles in bathroom) and the communal areas too (cracks in wash basins, tired furniture). So just to be aware of that.Staff are friendly and full of smiles as with all staff in Indonesia. However do not ask them to think outside the box it will cause confusion and problems!I would probably not stay in Mimpi again but choose one of the other businesses if I was to return just for a change.Friends were staying close by and we dived with them at Tulamben Wreck Divers (nice and professional) so I can not comment upon the dive shop.There is not much to do in Tulamben except dive or snorkel. You can of course sunbathe (beach is big rocks and stones), you can go for walks and you can arrange car/moped hire too.", "Date": "May 30, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR474155412", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "pandpwilson"}, {"Content": "for divers only I just returned from an almost perfect 2 week holiday in Bali. The sole black spot on our journey was the stay at the Hotel Mimpi Tulamben. The place turned out to be for Scuba Divers only with poor management and unfriendly staff. some details: - the nice pool was used by scuba divers to clean their equipment (note: I scuba-dive myself and know that there are showers and special water tanks to clean the equipment - not so at the Mimpi). - the sea shore was dirty - nobody ever cleaned anything there during our 3 day stay- the food was lousy (better go to the Hotel Tauchterminal!) and the staff was smiling but not really friendly.- the hotel room lacked mosquito nets.but ... - the price was ok (but there are way better deals elsewhere on Bali)- the weather was nice- the poolside chairs were nice- the rooms were nice and cleanBottom line: If you are a scuba diver and want to dive there - stay at the Mimpi but eat at the Tauchterminal. If you are not a scuba diver - do not visit Tulamben at all.
