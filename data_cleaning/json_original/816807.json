They do offer coffee and packaged pastry items, as well as some fruit, for breakfast in the check-in building.

We stayed 3 nights, checking in on Saturday and out on Tuesday. The hotel doesn't look overly impressive from the outside, but the inside and amenities and value completely won us over. This is a great place to stay on a budget if you can't afford the Hyatt right downtown. :-P The rooms really are newly-remodeled and look great inside -- new tile in the bathroom for the floor and shower, granite countertop for the sink area, new furniture in the room, large flat-screen tv, memory foam mattresses for the beds, etc. Our only complaint was that the bathroom door didn't quite shut all the way, but that was room-specific to our room. There's a mini fridge (no freezer in it) and a microwave, too. The a/c was fairly loud, especially while trying to sleep, but being in Phoenix (especially in summer) you're just grateful that it's working. :) Parking is free. Wifi is free (password was included on a card in the room). Continental breakfast was free, and although very basic was still nice to have. There were packaged muffins and pastries and granola bars, a bowl of fruit, and yogurt available in a little fridge in the lobby. They also had coffee, a pitcher of OJ, juice boxes, and bottles of water (definitely awesome). There's a McDonald's 1 block away if you want more easy breakfast options. The best part about this hotel is the value -- it's not the biggest, nicest, fanciest hotel around, but you will pay far less than anything else nearby and within walking distance of downtown. The first night of our stay was $69 and the second two nights were $89 each (jacked up due to the All-Star game, but still cheap comparatively). It's difficult to find anything less than mid-$100's elsewhere nearby. We walked into downtown every day, all the way to Chase Field from the hotel (just over a mile). It was fairly brutal in the July 100+ degree heat, but it's do-able and worth it to not have to pay for (and deal with) parking downtown. There's also a light rail station 4 blocks away from the hotel, so it's definitely an option to just walk to the light rail station and then take that anywhere else (Chase Field is 2 stops down from the closest one to the hotel -- $1.75 for a one-way ride, or $3.50 for an all-day pass). The convention center is even closer to the hotel than Chase Field, so getting there was an easier walk. Walking around in the winter would certainly be very pleasant, anyway. :) The hotel is kind of on the sketchy edge of town, but just barely on the border. It's not even sketchy, but just more run-down than the main downtown area. We never felt unsafe, even walking back to the hotel after 10pm sometimes. The staff was also quite friendly and nice -- the lobby where you check in (and get breakfast off the counter) is extremely tiny, but the guys checking you in were very nice. They even held onto a case of beer for us for the day we checked out while we went into town for the game, and we didn't want to leave the beer in the hot car all day long. They were nice about storing it in the back for us, and they didn't even drink any of it while watching it for us all day long. :-P It was an extra nicety that they did just because, not that they had to watch our stuff for us even after we checked out. All in all, it's a great value for your money, so if you can't afford the mid- to high-hundreds of dollars to stay somewhere fancy downtown, this is the place to be. You can still walk to everything, your room will be nice and new, and you can get free wifi and basic breakfast.

To my honest opinion this motel is not as bad as being reported provided you have appropriate reson for it. Talking to front desk was very helpful. Yes area is not great but the price you pay is also very reasonable. For example I was alone(male) and on business with the conference held at convention center in downtown from 8 am to 5 pm. I was new for the city but still was able to walk from the motel to convention center in 10-15 minutes with good morning walk/exercise!! The room was excellent with good shower and bed and LCD TV!! For the sake of completely true i would make couple suggestions as follow: Keep the skin lotion/conditioner not only shampoo(again it is not big issue for me),provide free HBO or similar cable channel like that, would advice keep the lamp with plug(electric outlet on the base) also at bedside so one can charge cell phone while answer it also being next to the bed,somewhat noisy A/C,may be provide free ICE(no big deal for me to pay 25 cents but give plastic bag for hyginic need). Agree the location is not the best but for me being alone and looking close to Downtown was important. Also close to airport and HWY 10. Overall I am very satisfied. The previous traveller complaint of about toilet seat/carpet was luckily not issue for me on my stay. Free Internet is plus and it does work flawlessly! I am very impressed with the room!! If you momentarily forget about the location and the name while in the room you I am sure feel like you are in Holiday Inn!! Continental Breakfast was not imp. for me. You will get what you Pay for. You cannot compare with Comfort suites/Holiday Inn when you are paying less than $60/night. Please review your need and situation before blame to the management!! If I have to come again to Downtown Phoenix I will definitely look into this Motel again.", "Date": "May 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne, Australia", "Title": "\u201cGreat location - good value with friendly service\u201d", "Author": "BBoy_11", "ReviewID": "UR105920307", "Content": "Very close to downtown area. room was very clean and comfortable, staff were friendly.

The room smelled, the tub was chipped, worn and had no drain cover, and the shower head needed a good scrubbing. The bed was comfortable, but since there were cars parked right outside my door, and a thin one at that, a good night's sleep wasn't the first thing I'd add to the pro's list. I was told that the location at least wasn't a dangerous one. I had no frame of reference. Free breakfast was wrapped breakfast things that are purchased at your nearest gas station. The guy at the desk, though, was very friendly and helpful. I was to arrive super late to begin with, and there was a mix-up with my rental car. He gave me directions to be able to get there without needing a taxi. What was funny, though, is that in the morning, when I cut my stay there short, I went into the office to check out. I couldn't see him anywhere and there was no bell. I had to call him on my cell phone to get him up. So, what I liked best: service. Liked least: the whole place.
