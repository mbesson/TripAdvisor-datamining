First impressions of the Compostela Suites is fantastic, looks brilliant from the outside with a lovely pool and sunloungers to match. Moving onto the rooms, I stayed in a one bedroom suite which had a small kitchen, living area, bedroom and bathroom. Nice layout with a comfortable bed, sofa, and television with a variety of channels. However the internet is far from good. Rather poor signal, even a Skype call with no video could barely connect and when it did, could only make out every other word, (it was the connection this end and not the other). The internet also decides to have a funny five minutes every hour or so. Great air conditioning in the rooms however my next point is the kitchenware you can purchase if you so desire. The pan handle was so loose that it snapped off on the third use. No sharp knife included which is a hassle, and note no kettle either. I was expecting to come to the Compostella Suites and have access to an oven, however it is only a microwave and a hob. I was also expecting a washing machine as the website describes, but I have to use the one available downstairs which is 3euros for a wash and 2euros for a dry. The other downside to the Compostela Suites is the shuttle bus runs from 6am - 12pm, then 7pm until 1030pm (Those figures may be slightly out), which is far from ideal for a business person who was leaving at 4am and returning at 3pm. Like I said, if the Compostela suites improved the shuttle service, the internet and included an oven in every room, then it would be THE place to be. Overall it is an OK place to stay, however I do have it on good authority that the Aeropeurto suites across the road, include fantastic internet, an oven and a 24hour shuttle bus. I will be there next time.", "Date": "August 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cNot impressed\u201d", "Author": "Victor C", "ReviewID": "UR135896980", "Content": "Not really impressed, is the second time that I stay, this time whewre dirty sheets, I have asked to be replaced twice but not succes, unlike i was offered to be send clean sheets to be change by myself , not very nice when Im paying for a service. the pool open to late and close to early", "Date": "July 31, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Madrid", "Title": "\u201cVery nice\u201d", "Author": "Posted by an Easytobook.com traveler", "ReviewID": "UR135756780", "Content": "Everything was fine, and clean and the location was very good ...only it was very pity that the childeren was not allowed to have any kind of toys in the water...it was a little bit borring at the swimmingpool for the childeren...and also we didn't have any garden chairs and table for the lovely terras we had...the appartment is good for family with childeren and for people without childeren...even fot old people...because it has a elevator...", "Date": "July 30, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kettering, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cCompostela suites are fab\u201d", "Author": "Nina A", "ReviewID": "UR135246678", "Content": "I am still at the compostela suites, my two bed apartment is very spacious and clean and modern. I brought my own plastic plates, pan and cuterley. I have a washing machine that I requested and got. The tv channels are fine I am in Spain so expect Spanish channels. The pool is a godsend and clean. The bus goes to the metro and costs E1.50 from a local Makro. It's then E2.00 metro wherever you want to travel in the capital. The centre was definitely worth a visit. Nearby you have a bimbo bread factory which had a shop selling bread at a very cheap price. The shopping centre is 10minutes away and good for food,eating out and time out! I would stay here again as you get aota for your money and at night I understand there is a bus that runs all through the night if you wanted to visit the bars etc. It is used by mainly the Spanish and very clean.

Another problem, there are no shops close (or we didn;t found them) or it was very late - we arrived in Madrid at 2 am.

Although the place is quiet far from downtown Madrid( approximately 20 minutes by taxi ) the complex is not too far from a shopping centre, but this is the only thing you get as far as entertainment and dining...It is located in an industrial area far from everything. It could get noisy from time to time and the rooms are not really sound proofed. If you stay for a long term, don't expect the room to be clean as the maid come no more than once a week and do the bare minimum. If you want something more than bathroom tissue and new towels once a week, they will charge you 20 EUR per day. Overall, the rooms are minimal but okay, but the service is just terrible.

Considering that they market their hotel as having multilingual staffs. The walls are paper thin so you could really hear the sounds from the hall way, bad for someone who is staying with bunch of teenagers/ students who are yapping all the time or people who are drunk or small children playing. Another thing that really really pissed me out of my wits, the rude housekeepers who keep on knocking in our doors even though we put the \"do not disturb\" sign, they knocked on our doors 3 times! To the point that i have to call the receptionist and confirm them that we are leaving just right before the check out time. it would have been a very nice stay but having the pesky housekeepers just way too much for me.

Not a great deal nearby, but there is a big shopping centre around the corner. This houses a decent supermarket and a load of shops and restaurants. Further down the road there's an Irish bar called The Clover House. They do decent food and the staff are lovely. The staff also speak English which is a big help. Some of the restaurants in the shopping centre only have menus in Spanish and don't speak much English - but they are as helpful as they can be. The apartments themselves are ok. The staff all speak English and there's 24 hour reception. The issue myself and my colleagues have is mainly centred around what they give you to use in the kitchen. It all seems a bit 'lottery' like. Only 1 fork in one apartment, others had 2. Some had no cups, I had 4. No kettle, no toaster. There is a hob and a microwave that grills - but no microwave safe bowls or dishes. I also got 2 frying pans - both of which were filthy and greasy and both handles came off after a vigorous washing. As I said, the location is a tad remote and we are surrounded by offices and a big bread factory. My apartment isn't road facing though so I can't hear anything from that side. What I can hear is the drunk holiday makers coming back from their night out. I understand that this is a holiday complex but this has also been advertised as good for us business folks. There are 4 blocks of apartments - I don't understand why they didn't keep one block for business use and the other 3 for the holiday people. The holiday people slam doors, shout to each other from the opposite ends of the halls and just generally make noise. Not so funny when you've got to get up for work at 6am. Not much good for a lie in either as there usually some child (who has probably just been refused a bag of sweets) going absolutely beserk. So. Apart from the kitchen utensils, it is clean.

The hotel is nice, rooms good equipped but the service-terrible! First of all, they have free airport shuttle service- we were told to wait at T1 departures where all the hotel busses stop. We spent there about 1 hour waiting; we saw all the shuttles of other hotels but not the ours. My husband called 4 times to the reception to inform about the shuttle, and they told us it was coming in 4 minutes to the airport. After long waiting we took the taxi, that cost us about 15 euro (it is only 4 kilometres, but they charge you for many irrational additional fees). The taxi driver was very rude; he didn\u2019t want to return us left money, only after my husband\u2019s insistence. The approach of the hotel personal was indifferent also later. It is aparthotel, so one would expect the kitchen is ready for guest use. I tis- but the fork, kettle and all the staff is locked and if you want to use it- you have to pay 4 Euros per day. It is a bit ridiculous. Then the internet. The aparthotel is situated in business area, next to the airport. The website of the hotel says it has wifi internet access. We relied on this, because both of us had to work via internet, but it was a big problem. The internet was not working at all, and the receptionist just smiled and told us if we need it, we had to work in lobby. Well, we didn\u2019t see it funny, if such a hotel (not the cheap one) offers something and then does not provide this service.
