I really loved this place - it is very central, wonderful neighborhood, anything you need is nearby. The hotel itself is quite new (or newly renovated) in a fresh, young designed way. The staff is more than great - I checked in a bit too early, but that wasn't a problem at all. They arranged for an already cleaned room (and gave me an upgrade - yeah!), so I could refresh before starting my tour in Berlin (I had booked online for the Gerhard Richter exhibition for that day). On the top floor where you can have breakfast in the morning (which I had not the chance to try as I was already dated for brunch with friends\u2026) there is a nice lounge with a wonderful balcony - and from afternoon till evening you can grab coffee and tea and water and cake and similar stuff for free - while reading some newspaper or magazines provided as well or enjoy the wonderful view.... And there are always bottles of water for free at the \"ottomat\" on the basement - a quite well equipped vending machine as substitute to a fridge in every room. The snacks are very \"organic\" (nothing for me with a soya allergy), but the offered drinks where excellent (Penfolds Shiraz, very good!!). The elevator which stops between two floors, so you have to go up or down half the stairways (no problem for me, but maybe worth to mention), is quite cute as well: \u00a0bird's twittering inside feels like being in a forest. My room was huge with an extra dressing area, very comfy bed, flat TV etc. The only two minor criticism are the light smell of fresh paint (?! It smelled like the door frame got fresh color recently\u2026) and, as my room was next to the stairway, a bit noisy in the middle of the night when other quite young guests came back from clubbing. But in Berlin you cannot expect totally quiet location. And one thing to mention: The reception staff is only there till 11pm, if this matters to someone... - for me it wasn't. Keys etc worked very properly. Oh, and visit the coffee shop next door, GIRO. Nice design, very good coffee and friendly staff as well.... So, I will be back soon in Hotel Otto - that's for sure.

The room was well equipped, free wifi (although you need 24 hour tokens to use) and the mattress was just right - not too firm, nor too soft. The lift is brilliant. No food in the evening, but there are loads of good places within a short walking distance. Only drawback I can see is that you have to navigate a short set of steps up to the lift from each floor level, so not suitable if you have limited mobility.

We would have much preferred some kind of a view. I would suggest that you request a room other than 103, 203, etc. We don't particularly like large breakfasts, so enjoyed local cafes.

It is located in a quite area although there are many good restaurants, of most nationalities, within walking distance. The hotel is about ten minutes walk from an S-Bahn station. This will get you to central Berlin within 15 minutes, without changing trains. The reception desk staff all spoke excellent English and were very helpful with regards to directions, restaurant recommendations and travel queries. The lift (which had a recording of birds singing inside) served alternative floors so often left a short flight of stairs to negotiate which could be tricky with very heavy luggage. Now let me say that I paid a very low rate for a \u2018comfort\u2019 double room (bigger than the standard rooms) which was like a mini-suite. I also got free breakfast every day (priced at $13 Euros per head) thanks to Tripadvisor. The room was one of the biggest that I have had anywhere. It had a very large bed, with memory foam mattress, a walk in wardrobe-room and large bathroom (with wet-room shower). There was a Juliette balcony with full length opening patio-style door. The room was very stylish and very clean. There was a TV and digital safe. Unfortunately, there were no tea and coffee making facilities, or fridge, but free bottled mineral water was provided. There was also a powerful floor-fan. Free wi-fi was also provided. It is important to note that I stayed in august during a very hot and humid spell. Fortunately my room was at the back of the hotel and out of the sun for much of the day, although it still got very hot. Air conditioning would have been a godsend. I really needed the fan and free water! Breakfast was served in a room on the top floor of the hotel. It has a small balcony with some outside seating. Breakfast was buffet-style, but of very good quality. All German food is expensive, so I doubt if you could have saved much if you took breakfast outside of the hotel. Once again the room was in desperate need of Air-con and seemed to suffer from a plague of wasps. The breakfast staff were charming. Tea and cakes are provided free each afternoon which is a nice touch although any self-respecting tourist would be pacing the streets of Berlin and would miss them. I was given free coffee when I arrived early to check in to my room (another nice touch). The Hotel does not have a bar or restaurant as such. Nearly all aspects of the hotel and it\u2019s service were excellent, apart from the lack of Air-Con, fridge and a kettle.

For EUR 115, I had a huge room, with a comfortable double bed, a single bed in one corner, a walk-in wardrobe area, a decent-sized bathroom and large windows letting in plenty of light including a full-sized French Window that opened fully. The room's designed is essentially functional, but the light and the splashes of colour here and there made it a pleasant environment as well. As one would expect in Germany, everything was spotlessly clean and efficiently serviced. The hotel staff were friendly and very helpful - I really appreciated the front desk's patience in explaining directions to various sights every morning. For me, what stood Hotel Otto above other hotels in this bracket were the numerous little touches intended to make guests feel welcome as well as cater to their convenience. For instance, I arrived two hours before check-in time but the front desk did not hesitate to try and give me access to my room as early as possible. I was told the room would be ready in 20 minutes and was invited to leave my bags at the desk while I relaxed in the lounge on the 7th floor. I decided to leave the bag and head straight out to do a bit of sight-seeing and when I returned several hours later, I was pleasantly surprised to find that my luggage had already been placed in my room.... Other nice touches included the specially-printed tour maps handed out at reception, the unlimited complimentary drinking water (either placed in the room or kept near the vending machine for guests to help themselves to), free wifi and the complimentary coffee and cakes available on the 7th floor all afternoon. The 7th floor lounge was large, spacious, airy and full of light. As well as plenty of seating inside, a balcony terrace was also available to dine at. I had a free breakfast voucher so don't know how much the morning meal cost, but it certainly seemed like more value-for-money fare: the buffet was laden with a large selection of cereals, patisserie, bread, cheeses, cold cuts, salads, vegetables, fruit, yoghurt, jams and spreads as well as hot eggs, bacon and sausages. Another lovely little touch was the bottle of chilled bubbly included along with the juices, water, tea and coffee. The hotel does not offer room service but a well-stocked vending machine dispensed snacks, sweets and drinks. The vending machine accepted notes as well as coins and provided change. On the downside, I did not notice an air-conditioner in my room. This was fine by me because the weather needed no more than the pedestal fan provided in my room (especially with the windows open) but I wonder if this might pose more of an issue during the height of summer... Finally, a little about the hotel's location on Knesebeckstrasse near Savignyplatz in the Charlottenburg area. This was a lovely, residential area - quiet and peaceful, with plenty of bars, cafes and restaurants, an S-Bahn station (Savignyplatz) and an abundance of greenery, especially around Savignyplatz. The neighbourhood felt safe at all times and I found the residents to be friendly, polite and helpful - one lady even offered me an extra brunch voucher she had as I sat down next to her table at the Bond restaurant. The area was a good example of one aspect of the Berlin personality: the amiable, easy-going, cafe-culture one. With the sun making brave attempts to best the clouds, it was very pleasant indeed to sit at an outdoor table (practically every single restaurant in the area seemed to have outside seating) with a Schwartzbier and a cigar... Nearby restaurants I would recommend: Mar-y-Sol at the bottom of Knesebeckstrasse (just by Savignyplatz) for superlative tapas, Cafe Brel around Savignyplatz for authentic French bistro fare and Der Kuchenladen at 138 Kantsrasse for an indulgent mid-afternoon cupcake and coffee.

There are numerous small book, antique and craft shops in the direct vicinity. Very convenient for the shops on Kurfurstendamm and the Sunday flea market at the west side of the Tiergarten. S-Bahn, U-Bahn and city bus connections are only a few minute stroll away in a couple of directions with the main hub being at Zoolog Garten, from where Alexanderplatz is a mere 20 minute bus journey. Alternatively, an hour or so strolling through the Tiergarten will get you very nicely to the Brandenburg Gate.

We booked a comfort room, so a slight upgrade from the standard room. The rooms were uber modern, decorated and furnished to a very high standard. The beds were very comfy and the walk in wardrobe was great as we could dump all our stuff out of the way. Check in for the hotel was easy and strightforward the and reception staff were welcoming. There was a free map and some good information provided in the room. We had breakfast included in the price, and it was very handy to be able to eat and then go. The breakfast consisted of croissants, cakes, hot buffet, fruit, youghurt, meats and cheeses and plenty of differnt drink. The hotel had free cakes and drinks aswell during the afternoon and into the evening, and again it was nice to go and relax after a hard day walking round the city. Whilst the hotel says it is only a few steps away from the Ubahn and S bahn station in reality its 10 minutes walk from the S Bahn station, but only a few minutes walk from the U Bahn station. As such I would recommend on arrival coming into city with bags you use the U Bahn station (recommended by the hotel on their own website info). When you come out of the U Bahn station if you look for the renaissance theatre on the corner the hotel is on the same street. We arrived in the dark and spent ages trying to work out how to get to the hotel. In the street where the hotel is there are lots of different restaurants where you can eat. If you want bars and a slightly busier night out I would suggest coming out of the hotel, walking left, then at the end of the street walking right (or catching the U Bahn and getting off at Zoo Garden) If you walk 15 minutes down that road you get to the ZOO Garden stations and in that area you will find a cheap supermarket, McDonalds, Burger King , Pizza Hut and a Euro Centre where there is an Irish Pub and a KFC. From here you can also walk to famous Kurfersdamm shopping area. Overall this hotel is a great base from which to explore the city, its in a peaceful location so allows you to catch up on some much needed zzzzzzzzzzzzzzz's after a long day in the city.

I may very well have been unlucky but I left distinctly underwhelmed at the whole experience. It didn\u2019t start well. The Reception is not 24 hours and as I was arriving late, I emailed the hotel a few days in advance to let them know and ask how I could retrieve the key. Sadly, my email went without a reply so I got a German-speaking colleague to call and organize this for me. On the phone they mentioned that they had replied, but their emails to me had bounced back \u2013 this I accept is perfectly possible and so I was happy to receive the code and make the arrangements to arrive late. However, as I had given my phone number in the booking, if they had really tried to contact me, why couldn't they have phoned when the emails kept bouncing back? Arrival was very easy, just entered the code into the keypad and my key popped out. I let myself in and that was that. The room was fine, very clean with a safe and a work desk. It was extremely hot but once I found the radiator, I was able to adjust the temperature. The next day, I went out and on returning, late in the afternoon, I found that my room had not been serviced. I mentioned this to reception who said that the cleaner had now gone home and that it would have to be serviced tomorrow. I was fine with that as she was kind enough to replace the towels. Now, one of the reasons I booked this hotel over others was the free wifi, which unfortunately, gave up the ghost on my second evening. It wasn\u2019t repaired until Monday morning which meant that I went without it for most of my stay. One can forgive one small error, such as the room not being serviced or an email not being replied to, but three is really stretching it. Moreover, the hotel claims to offer free coffee and cake in the afternoon and I found a stale piece of chocolate muffin and cold coffee. The management were kind enough to offer me complimentary breakfast on the last day but sadly I had to refuse as I had an appointment. They did take EUR10 off of the bill for the lack of wifi and room servicing but that was only after I insisted on this and had I not, I feel that they wouldn\u2019t have done so. As I mentioned at the start, I may very well have been unlucky with this stay given the positive reviews elsewhere. The room was clean, when it actually was serviced, and the hotel was very easy to reach being less than 15 minutes from Tegel Airport on the X9 bus (get off at Ernst Reuter Platz). Still, this hotel is not at all suitable for disabled travellers \u2013 the elevator stops between floors and doesn\u2019t reach the breakfast room. Would I stay here again? Probably not.

That's why I didn't give the location a 5, because it's not exactly centrally located (although there a plenty of little cafes and restaurants), but you can get anywhere from the metro station. My kids (ages 8 & 10) also loved this place.

My husband tipped them off that we were celebrating our wedding anniversary and they upgraded our room and there was a big bowl of fresh strawberries waiting for us, what a welcome! The staff were really helpful with all our requests and give really useful information to help us make the most of our trip. There is a direct link to the airport from Savignyplatz station which is about 10 minutes walk away. I think that if we returned we would definately consider hiring bikes, although the efficiency of the public transport compared to the UK's makes me weep; cheap and on time.

There is parking at the hotel, but I saw plenty of street parking too. I liked the location, a nice quiet area near the Zoo. It's about a 10 minute walk from the Zoo station and about 2 minutes from Ernst Reuter Pla. There are a ton of nice restaurants in the area (2-3 block walk). As noted, the closest supermarket / convenience stores are by the Zoo (not very close), and they close pretty early (often by 8). It's about 20-30 minutes from Hbf. The room was clean, nice size shower, comfy bed, helpful staff. The reception is not open 24/7, so I'm not sure what they do for late arrivals / lost keys and stuff, but I didn't have any issues.

Our room (a 'Comfort' room with two extra single beds for the kids) was spacious even with the extra beds. Everything worked, all the usual extras (hairdrier, range of soaps and shampoos, etc) were there, the staff were friendly and spoke excellent english, etc, etc. In other words, everything was just as described by all the other positive reviews for this hotel. We didn't have the breakfast there (12 Euros per head is a bit steep for four people each day for a week), but there are a couple of excellent cafes within literally a few yards. Turn right out of the hotel and on the corner is a conventional pastry and sandwich selling cafe and turn left, and there is an organic place a couple of doors up and then a few yards further on just around the corner a more up-market joint. We stuck to the first one and managed to get a decent spread for under 20 Euros a day. As others have said, the hotel doesn't have a restaurant, but there are many places to eat around the hotel. We tried several restaurants, all within five minutes' walk at maximum (and that's me walking at a tortoise pace after injuring my foot on day one of the holiday). Damas (on Goethestrasse - cross road outside hotel, turn right, go left at corner with the pharmacy on it, and it's about two shops down) sells excellent Syrian food (if you've not had it, think Turkish but with a little less obsession with cinnamon). Towards the bottom of Knesebeckstrasse (but before you reach Savignyplatz) on the same side of the road as the hotel is Pratirio, which sells Greek Cypriot food. The meze selection was excellent. The Manjurani restaurant (turn left out of the hotel - it's about fifty yards away) on Knesebeckstrasse sells Indian food. In some ways it was like a blast from the past; it was like Indian food was in the UK about twenty years ago before it all got sophisticated. However, it was good filling and unpretentious food. If you're going to bring food back to the hotel, there is a little problem of finding a supermarket. The nearest one we found was Verbrauchermarkt Ullrich. This was across the road from the Zoologischer Garten Station (*very* easily accessed using the superb public transport system). Excellent range of packaged cold meats and cheeses, and more types of drink (alcoholic and non-alcoholic) than you could shake a stick at. We thought the bread was adequate but not thrilling (but there are other bakeries near the hotel you could use). As regards entertainment, etc, we were there for the galleries, museums and zoo, and Hotel Otto is well situated for these. [Tip - get yourself a Berlin card (used enough it will save you money and it will certainly save you time) - this gives you access to bus, train and subway]. The two nearest stations/bus stops are: Ernst Reuter Platz (about two minutes' very slow walk) and Savignyplatz (about five minutes' very slow walk). The whole system is very easy to use.

Not bad - we ended up having a comfortable and pleasant stay - but I'm not sure I would stay there again. We were there for four nights mid-April and I had booked a comfort room based on the positive reviews and VERY reasonable price. Upon arriving, the girl at the reception was super nice and polite, but from the get go I started to get a little worried that this hotel wasn't quite the little boutique place we had in mind. For one, the elevator and stairway system is really bizarre. You have to go down some stairs to take the elevator and then it drops you off between floors so you either have to go up or down a short flight to get to your room. Odd to say the least and a real hassle if you have a lot of luggage!!! Our actual room was HUGE, and I do mean huge, but awfully... bare.... I felt like it was furnished from an IKEA catalogue and never quite finished. There was double bed and two night stands and a hip lounge chair thingie and a bed/couch thingie on the far side of the room and... that was it! No little decorative touches, not a single thing in the wall!! Trust me, the room was huge, and they hadn't hung a single thing on the wall. Can't help wonder what they were thinking - it would've made a big difference in giving the room a little more warmth. There was free wireless which seemed to be a rarity in Germany so that was good... The closet was fabulous - again, HUGE. It was basically a door and when you opened it there was this big walk-in closet with a window and tons of space. That I loved but, again, it seemed a little odd. In proportion to the size of everything else the bathroom was very comfortable and functional but kind of small... you figure with all the empty space in the room they could have made the bathroom a liiiitttle bigger!!! But, okay, no major complaints there. One major gripe and, again, bizarre oversight, was that there was no mini fridge. Given the size of the room you wonder why they didn't just stick a little fridge somewhere in the room... trust me, the extra cost would've been minimal and there was TONS of space!!!! Odd.... So yeah... a little too minimal and spartan for our tastes. Another thing - i specifically asked for a high room with a view and so we had a great room on the 6th floor overlooking the main street but the rooms looking out back were dismal. All the rooms on the back side of the hotel faced the open-air parking garage and some really dinky apartments. I wouldn't have stayed in one of those rooms had you paid me. Some might argue that they might not care about the view but the thought of waking up to a measly parking lot is totally depressing in my book. On the plus side, the location is FABULOUS!!!!! We loved the fact that it was in a quiet and hip residential area with TONS of great restaurants and bars within 2-5 minutes walking distance. Savigny platz is only a couple of blocks down and has a great choice of restaurants - from Spanish to Thai to Greek to German... you name it! One we particularly liked was \"Brel\" - great filet mignon and desert and atmosphere at very reasonable prices. (Truth be told though Berlin is a city of reasonable prices!!!) There were also great little cafes and pastry stores around for breakfast and the metro was super close. The hotel did offer a breakfast buffet for 12 euro a person and was supposed to fabulous but we never did try it opting to eat breakfast out instead... Another plus was the service - I must admit all the staff were really nice and polite and did the best to accomodate. They gave us lots of advice on sightseeing, tickets, maps, even bringing us a bucket of ice to keep our water and beers cool ! (two words hotel otto - mini fridge!!!!!) So all in all we had a really good time but don't know if I would go there second time around - I would try to find a hotel in the same neighborhood but a little more luxurious... but if that failed we MIGHT go back just because we loved the area so much.... If your tastes run to the more lean and minimal though and you don't mind the absolute bare walls (!!!) then it's good value for money, the location is super, there's tons of closet space (!), and the staff very polite and professional.", "Date": "May 21, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ottawa", "Title": "\u201cGood deal and good location!\u201d", "Author": "OttawaCatLady", "ReviewID": "UR30239571", "Content": "Hotel Otto is a good deal in a city where many hotels are very expensive.

I vacation with my family in Europe almost every summer and the Hotel Otto was one of the best experiences I\u2019ve had. The hotel is clean and very well kept, with nice touches like tea and cake left out in the pleasant modern dining room/terrace to be enjoyed in the afternoon and evening (after touring the city, we looked forward to having a little desert on the terrace) and, when we were there, champagne to make mimosas at breakfast. When I arrived, I asked if there was somewhere I could refrigerate my medication and the very helpful and friendly desk clerk upgraded our room to one with a mini-kitchen. The room was good sized with large windows and spare but comfortable furnishings. The location was terrific for us, a very nice neighborhood with lots of restaurants and bus, u-bahn and s-bahn nearby. The Zoo Train Station is within easy walking distance which is where many interesting walking tours leave from (we used Original Berlin Walks). When I left, I discovered at the airport that I had left behind my camera bag. I frantically called the hotel and the clerk immediately found the bag, called a cab and sent it on its way to me. It arrived just in time. When I next visit Berlin, I will certainly stay at the Hotel Otto.", "Date": "August 19, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston", "Title": "\u201cReally great hotel in Berlin!\u201d", "Author": "kgravis", "ReviewID": "UR18916897", "Content": "Hotel Otto is an amazing find in Berlin.

There is very little of a reception area, the breakfast room is located on the top floor with commanding views of the rooftops of the city . Breakfast charged at 13 euros, but alternatively, you can find ample establishments outside and around the hotel. Although internet access is free in the hotel, there is no terminal so bring your own laptop. About 10m left of the hotel is a stationary shop which offers internet access for 1 euro/15 minutes. The room I was allocated was situated on the ground floor overlooking the rear car park. It was a very hot day so was glad as room was not air conditioned. Bed was soft and comfortable, had a flat screen TV, bathroom with shower, security safe, hairdryer with complimentary bottle of water and fruit basket. All in all, 65 euros a night booked through Hrs.de , this hotel offers reasonable value. Although I would stay at this hotel again, the plus being the Ku Damm shopping district , many of the tourist attractions are located in east Berlin which I found to be more interesting , full of character with trendy shops including the Galeries Lafayette department store and a vibrant nightlife. If travelling from Schonefeld Airport on S-Bahn, journey time to Savignplatz will take approximately 45-60 minutes taking in many stops on the way.

These were my 3rd and 4th visits to Otto. The place is now like a home from home! Beds are very comfortable in lovely modern rooms which have been renovated since the hotel first opened in 2006. They seem to be in a very stylish decor - minimalistic yet chic - clearly a lot of thought went into the design. Black curtains and colourful head boards. The bathrooms are just gorgeous, and very clean, with lovely walk in showers with a glass door instead of curtains. Rooms all now have their own hairdryer which is a proper plug in one and little extras for the traveller in a basket in the walk in wardrobe as well as a small safe, enough to store cash/passport/papers but not a bag or laptop. I booked single rooms but was given a large double on both occasions as I think the hotel wasn't quite full (lucky me!). There was even fruit in the room and a bottle of complimentary mineral water. The only thing lacking was a ceiling fan or, even better, air conditioning as the temperatures were around 28-33 degrees which was stifling so I kept the window/door open - needless to say one did not really need the lovely feather duvet!! The breakfast buffet was as stunning as ever - I love the fact they have prosecco there so always make a Bucks Fizz as a holiday treat! My only minor gripe is that the hot water samovar often runs dry and needs topping up as I don't drink coffee (which they bring in all sorts of variations) but the staff oblige by filling it up (you need to wait for it boil again) but they will bring me hot water in a pot as well. There is always a weekly \"speciality\" on the buffet:- week one was Scandinavian and week 2 was Bavarian. The hotel is walking distance to Ku'dam and designer boutiques and has easy access to the whole city thanks to the U-Bahn at Ernst Reuter Platz and the S Bahn at Savigny Platz - the S9 route from here goes direct to Schonefeld Airport. Don't forget to validate travel tickets in the little red machines on stations. The street on which the hotel is situated has loads of restaurants so you need never go far for a meal or eat the same cuisine twice! There are several lovely bakeries as well, so now I always buy a few fancy bread rolls to take home on my last day. Despite the lack of aircon and the sometimes empty samovar this place is a real gem, don't hesitate to book it!", "Date": "June 15, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Turkey", "Title": "\u201cSooooo nice!!\u201d", "Author": "SigoSema", "ReviewID": "UR16801818", "Content": "Me and my husband were in Berlin between 17th-19th of May.He did quite a search b4 we go and found Hotel Otto in the end.

When you walk outside the hotel, everywhere is full of nice restaurants and nice,cozy cafes. IT is only 10 minutes walk to Kurfurstandamm Strasse which is the most popular meeting point in Berlin. Staff is very friendly and the rooms are equipped with evrything you need.Beds are soo fluffy and clean.Towels,floor etc were also very clean and was changed and cleaned everyday.
