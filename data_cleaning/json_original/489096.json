It was smartly decorated and very tidy and well furnished, but nothing really that a 2 year old could damage. We stayed in mid-April which is slightly at the back-end of the season, and found that the price was less than the equivalent of two adjoining hotel rooms elsewhere which, with three children, was the alternative option we had. I would definitely recommend this place, it has a modest pool but it is on the 61st floor and not particularly busy so the kids could splash about without worrying anyone particularly. The views from the pool (floor-to-ceiling windows) at night was also incredible - a nice place to have a swim!

Meriton Kent Street (we stayed 3 nights in 2 bed unit there) is great but this is even better. Room ambience and decoration is superior here and view is more dramatic due to the extra height. Location wise there's nothing to choose between them. Only criticism my wife thought carpets were a bit dusty.

This property is a definite choice if travelling with large groups to Sydney that want to stay altogether. A must for parents with small children to avoid having hotel interconnecting rooms which can then lead to many problems and a very expensive mini-bar bill!!!!

Cnr Liverpool & George St. George St has the Apple Store, Queen Victoria Building and The Strand. Close to free buss service NO: 555 which takes you to Circular Quay - find this on either side of George Street (beware this service starts at 9.30am and is very packed on the first couple of trips). From Circular Quay you can catch the 333 bus to Bondi. Or a ferry to Manly - oh and if you have children aged 16, then they are charged as adults for any travel. Only students living in NSW are able to get a concession - shame this does not include all students who can provide a student Id card :-( Liverpool St is an easy walk to China Town, Darling Harbor, little longer walk to Circular Quay, Opera House and the Rocks, and then you are on your way to the fabulous walk over the Bridge to Milsons point and Luna Park (good rail service from this point, should your feet give out on you - or another option is the ferry which takes you back to Circular Quay. $5.30 per person) and they run every 1/2 hour (there is an information point where you can speak with someone and retrieve the timetable, prices and destinations). There is also a brilliant little bakery just at the back end of the train station here.

There is a Coles store located within the complex (underground), in addition to numerous specialty stores, coffee shops, and shopping complex. The Monorail which takes 14mins to do a circuit is located right next to the entrance of World Tower - cost $20 per family (4). You can stay on the Monorail for as long as you like for this price, however once you have exited the terminal, your ride ends. Worth going around and experiencing this mode of transport, and then hop off at your choice of destination, as as Darling Harbor which is outstanding. All in all it is a fantastic accommodation choice, especially if you require that little bit more from your holiday. Sleek, stylish, impeccable and truly unexplainable views..... must be seen to be believed. Oh and don't forget your binoculars to view the P&O liners pulling into Sydney, the fireworks that may just go off unexpectedly as they did for us, or the cricket at the SCG.

Extreamly well presented, new tastefull furnishings that blended well with the appartment without obstructing the veiw. The master bedroom was an appartment in it's own right with a fantastic jet tub and granite bench tops. The view of Darling Harbour as I awoke the first morning was so immpressive I thought one was still asleep and in a wonderful dream. The second bedroom, although smaller, still had the flow of elegance which carried on to it's own bathroom, which was as emaculate as the master bathroom. The Kitchen was smaller then I would have liked altho it was modern with everything thought out and a great use of space. From the kitchen to the formal lounge room with a large flat screen TV, DVD, CD player and a very cosey sofa, tastefull art on the walls and furniture to match. The main focal point was the small (atrium) I call it. A taseful table and chairs and a veiw to die for.

When we checked in there was amix up with room allocations, so our booked 2 bedroom apartment was upgraded free of charge to a three bed apartment, which really suited us as we were travelling with two adults and two small children. The first thing you notice at World Tower is the incredible view. We were on the 62nd floor looking down over Darling Harbour and surrounding areas. The kitchen, living room and bedrooms were very clean, although the bathroom floors had not been fully cleaned from the previous occupants, which was surprising and not very appealing, but not a huge deal in terms of overall satisfaction. The apartment was decked out with the modern furniture, kitchen appliances and entertaiment facilities. The beds were comfortable and the service staff dropped by each day to check if we needed anything. The hotel is situated right in the middle of Chinatown, so there's plenty of atmosphere at ground level. Restaurants and shops were seconds away with a stroll down George Street to Circular Key or The Rocks taking fifteen to twenty minutes. Overall we were quite happy with Meriton World Tower. Had the bathroom floor been spotless, we would have found the hotel to be outstanding.

This time, will definately be the last, because it was meant to be a very memorable moment for me. We were there to celebrate a very special occasion, and our stay was cut short. We found the security guards very imtimidating and unprofessional. Without going into detail of what happened, one security guard actually came up to me and apologized, after realising he had ruined our night and I had a long four hour drive home. We were also charged for items in the apartment which we didnt even consume and also a late checkout fee when we checked out on the same day we checked in. The previous time I had stayed, the security guard and person at reception were just rude. The security guard didnt even know how to get to their own carpark. Also, we have had 1 other group of friends and 2 other family members who have had bad experiences there.

Location is central, the views are to die for and the apartment is generously sized though I would have wanted the rooms to be bigger and the living a little smaller. We were in a 2 bedroom apartment, where both bedrooms were rather cramped. The Master Bedroom had a TV, and a bench for the suitcase. The second room had none, making it inconvenient for us to have to place our belongings outside in the living room instead. I suppose if you are traveling with your immediate family, it is fine, but if you are with friends or extended family members, it will not be so pleasant to have to constantly dig for your clothes, etc in the living room. As some reviewers have mentioned, this is a serviced apartment, so we should not expect five star service from the staff. However, I was just at another serviced apartment in Melbourne and they provided exceptional service every day from valet parking to bathrobes! I found it strange that the housekeeping was inconsistent. On some days, they provided sufficient toiletries and towels. On other days, they only left us with a bar of soap and insufficient towels. Not a huge problem, but strange, till I bumped into some of them hand carrying their equipment in the lift and I realised why they kept running out of things to provide the units. Shouldn't they be using the standard trolleys / carts like other hotels do? Also, since the unit only provided one hair dryer to be shared by every occupant, we have placed it in the living room for easy access instead of in the master bathroom. First two days, housekeeping relocated the hair dryer into our master bathroom. Both times we repositioned it outside. On the third day, they simply TOOK the hair dryer away altogether! Hmmm, did they not notice that the hair dryer was plugged in implying that we did need to use it after all. Anyhow, again not too big an issue, we called reception and they replaced another one immediately. Other things like washing detergent and dish washing liquids were not adequately provided as well. Again, they ran out of things on the way? So, you might wanna constantly call them for things like these, or just buy some on your own. The housekeeping team also apparently cleans your apartment more thoroughly with vacuum cleaners and what not on Mondays and Fridays. They don't. We still saw the same dust clusters at the same nooks and crannies when we got back. One thing to note is that the air conditioners turn themselves off after every four hours. This is really tiring, to have to get up in the middle of the night and switch them on again. If you are traveling to Sydney during Summer, you might wanna reconsider. You will return to a burning hot apartment, and you will perspire in your sleep. There is only one control panel for the air conditioning, so irregardless of who wants it colder or warmer, you have to compromise. If you are wondering whether it is easy to get food around the apartment, yes it is. However, it is mostly Japanese and Korean fare. There is a Coles supermarket just round the corner which is very convenient for those of you who want to cook. Just be sure to check that the cooking hood works cos ours did not work at all during my entire 9 day stay there. The bedrooms do not come with table lamps, only some dimly lit LED bulb lights wall mounted on the wall. It definitely makes reading in bed tougher, and you can forget ambience lighting. There are no lamps throughout the unit as well, so you can either have it really bright with their halogen spotlights, or none at all. The second bathroom shower piping must have been connected to the laundry and dishwasher ones, cos everytime someone uses these appliances while you are in the shower, the water goes ice cold one moment, and burning hot the next. So, be careful what temperature you set your shower at. It apparently did not affect my parents in the master bathroom, so I suppose it is only to the smaller bathrooms. All in all, good looking apartment, great views once again, and central location. However, bits and pieces of our stay there just did not add up to the standards you would have wanted for a place this price.", "Date": "September 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Noum\u00c3\u00a9a", "Title": "\u201cAmazing view, great hotel\u201d", "Author": "ADroin", "ReviewID": "UR117863681", "Content": "We stayed in a 3 bedroom apartment for 10 days (3 adults and 2 children).

Close to everything in the city, has plenty of places to eat literally metres from the front door, ranging from Subway, Hungry Jacks (or Burger King to non Aussies) to Japanese, Korean and Middles Eastern restaurants. There's also a Coles supermarket around the corner which closes at midnight. Since I'm an Aussie, the sites of the city didn't stand out for me as much as they would for most tourists. What stood out for me were: 1. Ground floor is called Level 10 (ten). Hence any floor you think your serviced apartment is on is really 10 floors lower. Think level 62 sounds good? Nope- It's really 52. 2. The size of the place. Big. I mean really BIG. I've been to serviced apartments in Hong Kong, Bangkok and Tokyo, and let me say this place was twice as big as I expected. I put some of my stuff all over the kitchen, and it's so big it barely makes an impact on the mess-o-metre. I now understand why check out is 10am, but check in is 2pm, instead of 12/2 like most hotels. I've also been inside a similar 2 bedroom serviced apartment in the Pitt St Meriton serviced apartment. There, ground floor is called Level 11 (eleven), and the 2 br apartment was half the size on mine **big grin**. 3. View. I ended up facing eastish, so missed the iconic symbols like Harbour Bridge, Opera House etc. When you ask for a room, request one which faces the pretty stuff. Mine was room 6*02. 4. Attractive and modern. Large LCD or Plasma tv in living room. Oddly enough, there was a CRT tv in the master bedroom. Master bedroom has an en suite with towel racks which are electrically heated- turn onthe power point, and it heats the rack. A useful novelty since it's winter in Sydney at the moment- around 13-15 degrees celcius during the day. One last thing. You get what you pay for.

You do not need to use the monorail either, just walk and walk. 5 minutes to the darling harbour. 5 minutes to hyde park. another 5 to the qvb. From hyde park it's 5 more to the botanical gardens. then another 5 to the opera house. from the botanical gardens go the opposite direction for 3 minutes and it's the nsw art gallery. 8 minutes from the world tower to the pitt street mall. You will pass countless restaurants, coffee shops, malls, grocery shops, delis, kebab places, and of course bus stops. Apart from the location, you also only need to pay for the above facilities I mentioned (room, laundry etc) without having to pay for room service, doorman, bell boys and the spa!

The reason we did this is because my younger sister used her hotel points at the Holiday Inn so that we could save money on a couple of nights stay. Plus, with my older sister coming in on our third night, we went from a party of four grown adults to a party of five. Clearly we needed a bigger space. Although there are many great things to say about the Holiday Inn, there are more great things to say about this apartment. We checked in to a pristine 3-bdrm, 2-bathroom apartment on the 72nd floor. Not only did we have much, much more space for the next few days, we also had fantastic views of Sydney (we could see Darling Harbour and beyond from our apartment!) and more importantly, for me, this apartment felt more central than the Rocks. Tons of restaurants, bars, Westfield Sydney, Pitt Street shops, Darling Harbour, the monorail are all within walking distance. One afternoon, we even walked to the Opera House, which only took about 20 minutes. Having a kitchen is great, so we were able to make our own breakfast in the mornings and even enjoyed delicious take out from a nearby Korean restaurant one evening. (I normally don't do take out when traveling, but we had a nice comfortable kitchen/dining area/living room so we figured, why not enjoy a nice evening in with food + wine after a looong day of touring the city?) We were also able to do a small load of laundry, which was a nice plus. At about $60 per person per night, I really think this place is a steal! You get pretty much everything you get at a hotel (even housekeeping and room service), but in a more comfortable space. And again, the location is superb! The only complaints about this apartment are (1) there's no free WiFi; and (2) service was not always reliable. One morning, we asked for something from the front desk (I forgot what), and it took them 20 minutes to bring it up. Still, we all loved our stay at the Meriton World Tower.

Fantastic views and a great hotel at prohibitive prices. Due to being fully booked over Christmas and New Year we looked around & were lucky enough to find the Meriton World Tower offering spectacular views and large luxury accommodation at a fraction of the price we had originally budgeted. We had a three bedroomed apartment which, as others have mentioned, can easily house six people with room to spare. The master bedroom is set slightly apart from the other two bedrooms. Enough to give a degree of additional privacy without being too far if one has young children. There is a large open plan living area with a modern kitchen and a separate laundry room. Everything you could want is provided for within the apartment and there is a nice pool and limited gym for those who want some recreation. There is a handy supermarket within the building complex if you are looking to self cater, good cafes (literally outside the front entrance) and many various restaurants offering a plethora of cuisines to suit all taste buds. The mono rail is literally next door and taxis outside are plentiful. The location of the Meriton World Tower whilst not on the waterfront is excellent as there is easy access to the shopping district, parks, museums and other attractions. Parking in the basement is available in limited supply at Aus$35/day and Avis is round the corner in Pitt Street if you want to hire a car. What are the negatives? Whilst Meriton has sister apartments close by with balconys, World Tower now has none. This means you are mainly dealing with canned air and many people do report/comment on feeling claustrophobic after a while with a need to 'get out'. I was amazed at how many times I overheard people talking about this in the lift and lobby. If you are a smoker it means having to go down 60+ floors to get out. If you have small children not having a balcony is probably a source of relief. There are three lifts serving all the floors and they are 'card activated'. No card, no activation i.e you are stuck. The service is slow and the lifts are not programmed for optimised running. This results in long queues of people getting increasingly grumpy at peak times. There are normally one or two staff at the front desk and whilst most of them do try to do their best it is here that the difference between a top hotel and Meriton is most apparent. The two staff members are supposed to cover all the functions of reception, concierge and bell boy and clearly cannot cope despite their best endeavours. This can lead to long queues waiting to check in or out and if one of the two on duty is helping guests put their suitcases in the 'lock up room' it can mean a fifteen minute plus wait. Check out is 10 am. Check in 2pm. So if you arrive on an early flight it can be galling to have to wait four to five hours before being able to get into your apartment. Subject to availability late check out can be arranged for a very reasonable charge. The internet service for booking and responding is first class. Crisp and efficient. All in all, the old saying of 'You get what you pay for' is a truism here. Great accommodation, location & views at a great price. The trade off? All the issues mentioned.

Booked through our local contact that uses Meriton often and gives them in excess of 350 room nights per annum. Our Apartments were not ready until 14:00 which is their normal check in time but hard when you arrive at 08:30 after a 9 1/2 hour flight. The staff were not sympathetic or tried to expedite the cleaning. Once we took possession of our Apartments we can only say great stuff, great views and superb furnishings but the crux is in the details.These are of no concern to anyone of the mostly incompetent staff. The problems already starts with actual technical set up\" One air con control for all 3 bedrooms? Which non thinking person thought of that? Only 4 elevators to service the Serviced Apartments? The wait in the morning and in the evening was up to 12 minutes just to get an elevator???? Unacceptable for this price. The hanger fixtures were facing the wrong way to the hole where you had to tread the hangar through in order to take the hangar out of the wardrobe were all facing the wrong way. Not a big issue but it shows the level of care that the staff who ran this place put in to it- none whatsover. The poor cleaning staff seem to be generally overburdned and under equipped! Nobody seemed to have taught them hhow to clean where to start and where to end and what to bring nor supply them with a sufficient amount of carts so that they could carry everything the needed to clean a Apartment. They hand carried sheets and towels like in a one star place and had small metal supermarket baskets for their provisions. All looked and felt very unprofessional. Mirrors left behind with streaks in it and stains on the fridge door remained there for the entire stay. The pool was supposed to be heated but actually ice cold. Beer could have been chilled sufficiently in this heated pool. One day the fitness room did not open at the time it was supposed to and according to a staffer because of heavy drinking by customers and staff the night before in the recreation area??? Oh boy real 5 star. The hammer is the uncaring and downright unfriendly reception staff. They are both incompetent and try to disguise it behind a so called professional look that is just plain rude. You know when you are in trouble, when in a place the security guards are friendlier then the reception staff, i.e. world tower. The only saving grace of the reception was David, a cheerful and happy lad that actually cared about people and in honest provided a great service. Regretfully he was not working every day but his colleagues should pay attention to him and copy him, that would make World tower a much better place. Our Air con in the master bedroom did not work for the entire stay. The first night a technician came and went with no results. The 2nd night David offered us a fan which brought some relief or to move. But moving after having settled in was not an option. He promised a repair service. Upon following up three timed during the next day I found out that the manager knew about the defective air con as they had scheduled as professional service to come in and fix it in 7 days! Why they placed us in that apartment in the first place then? Well to make it short they claimed the customer before you did not complain! Regardless if you know you have a problem you do not let a customer check in and make them suffer. As they could read in any basic service marekting text most customers do not complain they just do not comeback- a fact lost on these incompetent people. Messages were another real stinger. The phone has a voice mail function and blinks every minute for once or twice with a tiny red light-which of course nobody sees as the phone is located in a remote corner of the living room where nobody normally goes. When messages were manually taken they were not delivered and I was even lied to with the statement ,, we do not take messages\" but later this statement became a lie as we were able to proof who took the manual message that we never got. You think they would say sorry or our apologies? Never came across their lips. When my key card malfunctioned twice and I had to get it re programmed again you guessed right- no apologies offered. What is a great pity is that someone actually invested in world class facilties that are totally miss managed. I feel sorry for the owner and the future customers. I suggest to have a specialist go through these facilities with a fine comb and tweak and fine tune all physical faciltiy aspects. As for the staff with the exception of david they should be sent to work for the competition and new staff properly trained in providing caring and friendly and customer focused service.

She is so illogical - so all the bookings turned up, ours haven't yet but there is no reason to suspect even though there is no guarantee?

Overall we were satisfied with the two-bedroom apartment we rented for 10 days. The location is very convenient for families -- there's a good-quality grocery store in the shopping mall at the base of the tower, and Darling Harbour, with its great playground, is just down the street. The layout and features of the apartment are quite nice (e.g. high quality washer/dryer and kitchen appliances) and the views are wonderful. My main complaint about the World Tower atmosphere is that it's so sterile and impersonal -- there is virtually no service and no special decor or personal touches to it -- and it's usually crowded since they do a high volume business. The fitness center epitomizes the style of the building: great view, but basic equipment with virtually no amenities (for example, no towels to wipe down equipment, no remote control to change the TV channel). We also did not like how crowded the lobby and elevators always seemed to be, and the crowd tends to be younger and inclined to partying (even though there are \"No Parties Allowed\" signs everywhere). The value is good for the weekdays but they jack up the rates on weekends. All in all, this apartment worked well for us, but after 10 days we felt as though we had been sleeping in a high-rise box for too long. I'd have to conclude I probably would not recommend it for friends; I think we could have done better.

Settled on the Meriton after looking at various Sydney hotels and finding we'd get far more for our money going for a serviced apartment. At their standard midweek advance rate of $200/night, this was a good value for 3 of us; if we'd shared the cost between 4 it'd have been a real steal. Reception staff efficient if not overly charismatic. Living area in the apartment was huge - vastly more space than we'd have got for the same money in a hotel. Kitchen pretty well-equipped, though being right on the edge of Chinatown we ate out every night anyway! (Try the home-made noodles at the Sea Bay Restaurant just around the corner: it doesn't look like anything much from the outside but when you can get a delicious, filling meal for about $12, who's complaining?) Views from the balcony (indoors - we were on the 55th floor) are amazing - as long as you're not hoping to see the Opera House or Harbour Bridge! We spent quite some time just sitting drinking wine and watching the city at night. The beds were comfortable enough - no better or worse than the generality of hotel beds, anyway. The whole apartment was pretty much spotless, and the cleaning staff put the dishwasher on each day with all the stuff (glasses, mainly) that we'd lazily left sitting around. The swimming pool is definitely worth a visit, if only for the novelty of a 50th-floor view whilst swimming. Only encountered the much-documented lift problem once during our stay - just make sure that if you're on a tight schedule you leave an extra 15 minutes just in case. Location, while a bit off-centre, suited us just fine - it's a lively area, and there's plenty of bars, restaurants and handy shops nearby (try some cakes from Chinese patisserie 81 Degrees). Circular Quay is walkable - take the route through park and the Botanic Garndens - or the train station is just couple of blocks away. We had an evening flight going back, and staff looked after our bags on the last day for no extra charge. Overall, I would highly recommend the Meriton World Tower (except, maybe on the much more expensive Friday and Saturday nights). It'd be good for a romantic break, for a family or for a group of friends. Just leave extra time for the lifts and if you especially value a view of Circular Quay, look elsewhere!

When on holiday we always look for accommodation in an excellent location with large spacious rooms, a full kitchen to make catering for our three year old daughter easy, laundry access, good facilities including a heated lap pool and a nice outlook. The Meriton World Tower did not disappoint. In fact, having read some of the recent tripadvisor reviews the standard of the accommodation was a really pleasant surprise and it contributed to a brilliant family holiday. We found the building to be in a great location. We took a stroller for our daughter and walked everywhere within the central city between Darling Harbour and Circular Quay. The apartment we stayed in was on the 76th floor and had magnificent views over the airport, Darling Harbour and North West Sydney. It consisted of two very generous bedrooms (one with ensuite including spa bath), a large living area, a well appointed kitchen, laundry with washer and drier and a separate bathroom. The facilities included a functional fitness room, a fantastic two lane 20 metre lap pool that was very well designed and had no rebound wave effect, a good sized spa and a sauna. The pool/sauna area was on the 61st floor with floor to ceiling windows creating a spectacular setting. We want to make an important point regarding the service. A number of the earleir reviewers have commented on the poor service they received. We received friendly and helpful assistance from the reception staff particularly Tim who was extremely obliging. Our room was given a \"light\" service daily - vaccuming was done, dishes put away, rubbish removed, beds made and new towels provided and we considered it more than sufficient. It needs to be remembered that the accommodation is a serviced apartment building and the tariff really covers the large spaces, amenities and facilities that are provided. It is therefore quite unfair to compare the service with that you might expect at four and five star hotels.

We stayed there for three weeks, so definitely got to know the hotel pretty well... Location: A decent location that is pretty central to everything in Sydney. The corner of George and Liverpool is VERY busy especially during peak times. There are no decent restaurants in the immediate area, so you have to go to Darling Harbor or over to the park to get a good meal. If you are taking transit a lot, then go for the weekly (or more) passes they are a great deal compared to the one off fares. Half of the hotel is a residence - mostly a younger crowd that barrels through the lobby without concern for others... (that got old fast) The rooms: The rooms are huge and they have great appliances (all of ours worked). You can't beat having laundry facilities in your room when on a long trip. The biggest and most important downside to the rooms are the beds - they are like cots and so unbelievably uncomfortable that I actually slept on the couch a few nights. This made my stay (and trying to get over the jet lag) very difficult. The every-third-day cleaning is not very good and the bathroom floors are always dirty. The carpets need a good cleaning too. The water pressure is amazing. The views are great (stayed on the 65th floor with the view of Darling Harbor) - I had the view from the other side last time and they are both great. The air conditioner turns off after 3 hours and the room can get VERY toasty - even over night in May when it is cooler. I would always wake up too hot in the middle of the night and have to turn the air conditioner back on. The beds and the air conditioner are enough to keep me away when I return (I will be back for over a month next February). Facilities: The gym is very small (2 treadmills, a couple of other machines and a small weight circuit). The TV is behind the treadmills which is odd. The room has great views, but because it is generally so hot in there(!!!), the windows are usually all steamed up. The pool is a good lap pool. (Great views again). The temperature is good too, not too warm. There's a hot tub and sauna too. Lastly, if you are travelling with others that will have a different room make sure that you are on the same floor. Your \"key\" only gets you to your floor (and the gym on 61) so you can't visit other floors. (You have to go all the way to the lobby to get \"buzzed\" up) Bottom line - The beds and timed air conditioner are the deal breaker for me.

After reading some of the mixed reviews on this site, I was a little unsure as to whether I made the right decision, however once you enter your apartment all doubts you had are soon forgotten. Checking in was great, we got there about 20 minutes early and our apartment was prepared in about 10 minutes. The staff were delightful (which was surprising considering the reviews on here) and even offered to upgrade our 65th floor 3 bedroom apartment to a 70th floor apartment that was more spacious and had better views ! The apartment itself was quite large and well kept, although I wish there were more couches in the living room considering you could easily fit about 20 people in there. The bedrooms and bathrooms were very clean (all guests in my group are CLEAN FREAKS) and we loved the heated towels!! The kitchen is on the small side but the range of cutlery, appliances and cupboards make up for it. The views are beautiful and were one of the main reasons we didn't want to leave the apartment unless we had to buy food etc. The beds were not the most comfortable but I would say they were decent and the air-conditioning wasn't that bad but I would agree that during summer you might break out in a sweat by simply standing next to the windows! I was quite surprised that we did not experience any sort of loud, annoying guests considering there were about 10 groups of young people who were there for a weekend of clubbing and the fact that the guests in the room next to ours had about 40 people in there having pre-drinks on the Saturday night. The only moment during our stay where we became annoyed was during the night, where the reception staff are off and \"security guards\" take their place. The guy that was on both those nights was the most rudest and arrogant person I've ever met blaming us for not knowing that guest sofa beds do not come with blankets and that they run out at 10pm. We found out this was a lie upon checking out and the staff were thoughtful enough to refund our $100 for the sofa beds for both nights. I'd highly recommend this hotel for young people, couples and families with older children because when it hits about 10pm the area out front becomes seedy and resembles Kings Cross on a busy Saturday night.

Availability and conditions may change from time to time. At the moment there is a minimum of a 2 night stay for 2 people and you find out your room type on arrival. But any way you look at it, what a deal !! We got a 2 bedroom appartment for 2 nights on the 65 floor facing East for less than a third of the rack rate. The location and views are fantastic by any standard. The bedrooms are large, the kitchen fully appointed with fridge, freezer, dishwasher, stove etc. There are 2 bathrooms, one with spa bath and towel heater. A clothes washer and dryer round out the appliances. These are serviced appartments so the building does not have the extras that you get in a hotel. But you really dont need them. It is very central, there are many restaurants nearby and on site parking is available (We did not require parking so I cant give any feedback on it). For what we paid, the Meriton World Tower was brilliant!! We probably would not normally have been able to afford to stay here and enjoy such a high standard of accomodation. However, if I was paying full price I would just like to supply the following comments. I would have expected better from a 5 star property on the following items. I agree with some of the other comments that the beds are very hard (and I like a fairly firm bed !) and the pillows are thin and dont support well. I ended up with a bit of a sore neck after 2 nights. As a cost saving measure, the air con turns off after about 4 hours automatically, so you can come back to a warm room or have to get up in the night to re-start it. It can take a while to get a lift at peak periods, and the pool (very small lap pool), gym area was \"closed until further notice\" what ever that means. If we were to get a similar deal in the future we would definately return, but it would be a treat for us to stay in a place like this with its usual price tag. Bottom line...

The apartments are well furnished and depending on the room and the levels that they are on the views can be quite spectacular. The prices we got in 2005 for our room was excellent value for money but over time this has not been the case. Still, when compared to other hotels in the area, the price is reasonable. Our interactions with the staff have been mixed, though most have been friendly and courteous. On one occasion during check in, I asked whether or not the contact number on the form had to be a home phone number and the young man behind the counter insinuated that my partner and I were having an affair, when I was simply worried about my information being sold to telemarketers! One of our pet peeves when visiting the Meriton World Tower is that if you are assigned a lower level you have to take two elevators to get down to the parking lot. This means taking the elevator to the lobby and then snaking your way around the lobby to the next elevator. It seems like a minor inconvenience on paper but there is a lot of time wasted doing this, especially with the exceptionally slow elevator service. If you are above a certain level, you are able to go straight to the parking lot. Another peeve is that although Meriton World Tower is a serviced apartment, there is a clause in the agreement you sign upon checking in, that if there is unwashed dishes left in the sink left that you will be charged. Check out mornings can be rushed and stressful unless you are awfully good the night before! All that being said, we would not have stayed so many times if the experience had been entirely unpleasant. If the prices at Wotif were similar to the prices we paid for the first few visits we would continue to stay there, they were a steal.

The personnel even washed all our plates and cups again even though we have washed them ourselves!

The apartments are also close to Darling Harbour, Powerhouse Museum and Chinatown whic are just a short stroll away. QVB and Circular Quay are only a bus ride away. The receptionists on duty each day were very businesslike but helpful in assisting us with our needs.

Overall I feel that my stay has been subpar. First the good - location, location, location. These apartments are in the middle of the CBD and a quick walk to many great things. There's a mall underground that has some decent restaurants, a grocery store, a drug store, a liquor store, and a video store. There are always a ton of cabs driving by. And within about 5 minutes you're at oxford street which has some cool shops and a ton of bars and clubs. The building is also pretty nice - the apartment I am in is on the 63rd floor. I have a view of Darling Harbor and the city. The decor is average, there's some random pictures on the wall, blue and tan carpeting that appears to be the type that easily masks stains. The three bedroom apartment has two bathrooms - the master bath has a nice whirlpool tub, the secondary bath has a shower. Both showers have the handheld shower heads and the bathroom size is pretty generous. Now the bad -- for me, the biggest reason I even get a hotel/serviced apartment, is so that I have a place to sleep. The beds here are horrific. They take two single beds and push them together, leaving a large enough gap in the middle so that it's unsleepable. Right now there is about a 5cm gap. The beds feel like someone took about 50 hard springs and stretched a thin sheet over them. You can feel each coil and it's not comfortable at all. My coworker actually has started sleeping on the floor which he says gives him a much better rest. I'm considering starting to try that. A motel 6 has a better bed than this. Even sleeping on top of the covers, I can feel each painful spring. The maid service here does the bare minimum - changing the sheets and towels once a week. Even if you call to ask for extra service. They occasionally change the sheets in one room and leave the other two untouched. They vacuum exposed areas but never move anything to vacuum underneath it. They wipe exposed surfaces but wouldn't dream of moving a glass to the side to wipe under it. The air conditioning is also a pain - it automatically shuts off after 8 hours, so when you wake up in the middle of the night, the apartment is hot and humid While this apartment may seem like a good deal, unless you BYOB (bring your own bed), it's not worth it at any price.", "Date": "May 10, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "brisbane", "Title": "\u201cSuperb views and good value\u201d", "Author": "brisbane21", "ReviewID": "UR15626086", "Content": "We booked in to the Meriton World Tower for one night at the start of a party long weekend, and were checked in by the security staff as our flight was a late one.

All the apartments are of excellent quality. Appliances are good quality - it's easily possible to whip up a great meal with everything in the kitchens. Entertainment - All rooms have Foxtel, so plenty of TV to chhose from. Failing that, there is a DVD player and stereo too, so if you have your iPod, you're in business!

On the second night, after we inquired for the 3rd time that day when it would be fixed, they offered to either move us to another property altogether (this was already at 7:00pm and we had two toddlers with us) or give us the night free if we stayed in our hotbox. For the price we were paying we decided to stick it out and give them one more chance to fix it. On the third day, still not fixed and we ended up moving rooms anyway. Next, there were actually signs posted in the elevator lobby that during checkout time (promptly at 10:00am and you had better not be late or late fees would apply) the lifts got very busy so they actually suggested that you should checkout early so you weren't penalized.

I even laid down dishtowels on the chairs because I was paranoid by 3 year old would spill something. Also, I realize this is a serviced apartment and not a hotel, but there was no mention on their website that they do not provide baby cribs and only through a follow up phone call prior to arrival did I discover this. They gave me the number of a place to call to arrange for my own rental- where is the 5 star service? And, their no party policy/ excessive noise policy is bogus as on both Friday and Saturday nights we were woken up several times by drunks coming and going between 2 and 4am. Finally, I couldn't agree more with previous reviews that the beds are awful- two beds pushed together with a hard seam up the middle. On the weekend we were paying $500 AUD/per night so if you can get a really good deal, this place might be worth it. Otherwise, I'd recommend everyone to pass on this place.", "Date": "February 14, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney", "Title": "\u201cAwesome!!!\u201d", "Author": "iamfussy", "ReviewID": "UR13536173", "Content": "Probably the best hotel experience I have ever had! 1.

I initially booked the Meriton as most of the hotel rates in Sydney skyrocketed at the beginning of February and this one seemed to be unaffected by the price increases. The rave reviews on this site sealed the deal and I made a reservation. The location of World Tower is not that central. It is a fair distance to major shopping areas and attractions such as Circular Quay, though it isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t much of a walk to Darling Harbour. As I entered the complex the lobby seemed quite unwelcoming. More like the entrance to an office building. Staff were friendly but all were wearing casual clothes and they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t look very professional. Like the lobby, the lifts have a very \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccorporate\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 feel to them, as did the hallways within the building. Our 3 bedroom apartment was located on the 67th floor with amazing views to the east towards the sea. It was very spacious with a large lounge and dining area, a small kitchen, master bedroom with ensuite, laundry, 2 smaller bedrooms and another bathroom. D\u00c3\u00a9cor was very \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcpractical\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and looked rather IKEA-ish. I had a read of the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policy regarding parties and excessive noise, and I do agree with it, however, I was not very impressed with the way they have worded this notice. The threats of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dceviction without warning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 made me feel as if I had to be very careful to not talk too loudly or walk too heavily for fear of instant eviction. After seeing the city for the most of the day we retired to our room. We were hungry and decided it would be nice to order some room service. It was then that I realized the building itself doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t actually have room service. It is basically a delivery to your apartment door from a restaurant in the area. This means you can only order during the restaurant\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trading hours, and of course, we were too late. We then discovered that the air conditioner for the bedrooms was not working. This was rather annoying as the rooms were uncomfortably warm. The bed was by far the worst and most uncomfortable I have ever slept in. The mattress was hard and lumpy and seeing it was basically 2 single beds pushed together to make a king, the join almost felt as if I was lying on a metal bar. (I now know how Elaine felt trying to get to sleep on the sofa bed in Seinfeld!) The pillows were flat and didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t provide any support whatsoever. I woke up with a very sore back and neck. (Quite upsetting after sleeping in a Heavenly Bed at the Westin Melbourne a couple weeks ago and having paid a lot less for the room). Overall, I think the Meriton World Tower is okay but definitely not 5 star as they claim. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more suited to families and people who aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really fussed where they stay as long as they have lots of room to move. These apartments certainly have that, but for people who are seeking a more luxurious hotel experience in Sydney, I suggest you consider booking one of the more well-known hotel brands throughout the city.", "Date": "February 7, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Adelaide, Australia", "Title": "\u201cGreat views, great product\u201d", "Author": "pmta007", "ReviewID": "UR13248870", "Content": "We stayed at the Meriton World Tower in a two bedroom apartment for five nights. We chose the hotel because it was offering decent rates over the peak season in Sydney; we were also, understandably, lured by the excellent reviews that the property has received here on TripAdvisor. We arrived at the property before midday and staff quickly confirmed our booking (this was a simple process as we had booked directly with the hotel). Some reviewers have questioned the friendliness and efficiency of the lobby staff, but we had no problems. The woman behind the counter quickly took us through our reservation and, when we enquired as to what rooms were available she quickly obliged and took us through two rooms' locations and the views that were on offer. We had paid more on our third, fourth and fifth night (plus we were staying more than one night, which was probably why she was so obliging) but nonetheless, we appreciated the service being offered. You do however come to expect this service at the World Tower as views are important! We ended up settling on an apartment on the 77th floor (the top floor) which she explained had a larger lounge room. However, we weren't able to enter the room until 2pm (Meriton appears to stick to the 2pm check in policy stricter than most). We were told we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d receive a phone call should the room become available earlier. So, we went and had lunch on Darling Harbour (less than ten minutes walk) and returned at 2pm to receive our key cards. We were absolutely astounded upon entering the apartment. The top two floors of the World Tower (level 76 and 77) only have four apartments on each so more space is on offer, and you are given an enormous living room regardless of whether you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re in a two or three bedroom apartment (be sure to check out the photos above). I can assure you that apartments 7601, 7602, 7701, 7702 are the two bedroom apartments that are larger than most in the complex, offering views over the south-east and south-west, as well as the city. Another big advantage is the two top floors easily rise above the infamous Ernst and Young tower on the south-west corner, so views are completely uninterrupted. On that note, I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t suggest you choose an apartment below about level 66 facing south, or south-west unless you want a lovely peek into a lawyer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s office in the forenamed tower. We were in apartment 7702, which gave us an unbelievable view of Darling Harbour, Cockle Bay, Central Station, Chinatown, the Anzac Bridge, parts of the CBD (if you yanked your neck around further enough) and even as far out as the airport. Word goes that in clear weather, you can see as far as the Blue Mountains. The two bedrooms were spacious with comfy beds, large built-in robes and fantastic views. Quilts were also a nice surprise, since the staple blanket and sheet combo is not well suited to the climate. The two bathrooms featured excellent showers and large towels; ironically, the ensuite bathroom to the main bedroom was larger than the other bathroom off the hall. The fully-equipped kitchen would be very handy for people who like to self cater (a Coles supermarket is located in the shopping centre below to stock up on necessities, and is open until midnight). There was also a small laundry with washing machine and dryer which was handy. The air-conditioning timer, admittedly, was annoying in that the apartment would be warm when you returned from a day out. However, this was a minor annoyance, and the air con was efficient once turned back on. The west facing bedrooms will (understandably) get very hot in the late afternoon, so close the curtains if you leave mid morning and plan on returning in the early evening, and you won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have any problems. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rather funny that the hotel has a five star rating as, while the product on offer is well and truly five star, the service from staff and daily offerings are below par. The management refuse to do a full service daily, with only a change of towels, rubbish removal and making of beds (using the existing linen) offered daily. There is no in-house room service available, no concierge of any sort, and, watch out on your last day as failure to wash the dishes will incur a penalty of some sort. Nonetheless, we would definitely return to the Meriton World Tower provided the hotel continues to offer reasonable rates. The location of the hotel was very convenient, the price right, and the product well and truly five star.

I was under the impression from my reading, that 2 & 3 bedroom apartments were all on floors higher than 61 and assumed we would have the spectacular views described by other reviewers - not the case! We were given an apartment on floor 58 which sounded promising enough...but upon entering the room we were greeted with an excellent view into the office block opposite (I'm talking just metres away, not somewhere over the road!) - it was like being in a fishbowl, no privacy whatsoever. We would have had to pull the shades for the whole stay. The thought of a week in this room on full display to whoever was looking was not a good one - we asked at reception if we could please be moved. Quite a lot of other people were at reception also asking to be moved for similar reasons. After a bit of a wait we were able to move to another apartment on floor 35 but on the other side of the building, in a corner room. The views are still largely of other buildings but not right in your face like the first apartment. However, I am still disappointed that we were not able to stay on the really high floors that others have raved about. So, just be aware that booking a 2 or 3 bedroom apartment does not guarantee a higher floor! I have since checked some of the online hotel booking websites and they seem to guarantee a high floor - booking direct with the hotel definitely does not. You'd need to be on floor 61 or above to clear the tops of other buildings, particularly if you are in a room on the side facing the Ernst & Young tower. Apart from that particular disappointment, the apartment is good for a family. We have found the staff to all be OK (not enough of them for the volume of people they have to deal with) and no problems with waiting for lifts at all. The location is great. No party or neighbours noise but there is a bit of annoying traffic noise in the bedrooms (at this level anyway) - not super loud, but irritating. The air conditioners are set to go off on a timer every four hours; ours seems to go off only once every 24 hours - the place gets really stuffy and hot without air con - if it was going off every 4 hours I'd be getting pretty annoyed. The apartment at this level has a balcony that is half enclosed like an atrium, and then an outdoor area which is too noisy to want to sit out on, but handy for checking the outside temperature before venturing out for the day. It's actually a better layout than the higher floor apartment we first had, which had only an enclosed balcony and thin white shades which would have let in heaps of light - no sleeping in! There are proper sunblock drapes in the bedrooms of this apartment. If I did stay here again, I would make sure to guarantee a higher floor or to ask for one on the city side of the building - the room we are in now is OK, I'd be happy enough to get the same apartment - but a higher one would have been far better!", "Date": "December 6, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "North Somerset", "Title": "\u201cGood spot to enjoy the City life\u201d", "Author": "Westonboy", "ReviewID": "UR11016984", "Content": "Staying in one of the 3 bed apartments on one of the higher floors was worth it just for the views.

However, I managed to get a good deal on a 3 bedroom 2 bathroom apartment a few days before my arrival in Sydney on 7 March. I just wanted a 1bdrm apartment but there was only the 3bdm 2 bathroom apartments left which I went ahead and booked as the price was reasonable. On arrival I checked in no problem and was told my apartment was on the 71st floor. I could feel my ears pop going up in the lift. As soon as I opened the door I thought wow! The apartment was wonderful, I slept in the master bedroom which had an ensuite bathroom with jacuzzi bath which I just had to try out! There was a great , well equipped kitchen area, dining area, comfortable lounge area with TV and the whole apartment was fully air conditioned. There were also fantastic views of Darling Harbour. Meriton World Tower apartments are in an excellent location in World Square on Liverpool St, there is a monorail station virtually next door to the apartments and is also only a 5mins walk to Town Hall, QVB etc. My relatives were coming down to Sydney to meet up with me on the weekend. Unfortunately the price for staying at the weekend had at that point risen to $999 per night so I had to check out reluctantly. We checked in at the Formule 1 in Kings Cross and I can tell you that was an enormous shock after staying at the Meriton World Tower! However, we still had a great weekend.

The loungeroom was spacious and you were often distracted from the TV by the mesmerising views of the world revolving outside your windows!

Everything was modern, from the whitegoods to the marble benchtops! I was not required to bring a single utensil in order to cook a nice romantic dinner which was eaten on a large dining table - once again overlooking the hustle and bustle of the city below.

No receipts - nothing to indicate whose bags are whose. When we returned they let us into the room to get our bags - well, we could have grabbed an extra one or two and they would not have noticed!!

The markets are a 5 minute walk away, while there's a whole shopping complex located in the basement of the hotel! Everything is a short walk away, and public transport is available just outside the door. We stayed in a 3 bedroom apartment on the 67th floor, very high up!!

The master bedroom had an en suite with spa bath, and we especially loved the viewing room. The apartment is equipped with stainless steel appliances and laundry. Everything in the apartment worked perfectly. Although there was a remote missing (can't remember if it was for the TV or Hi-fi system). The pool (on the 61st floor) was great but I believe the gym was closed for maintenance (not that we planned on using it). I can't say much about the staff or service, we only interacted with them during check-in/out and once when we didn't know how to work the oven. On those occasions they were perfectly nice. The one bad experience we had was the elevator situation during check-out. We checked out on a Sunday, which I'd imagine is quite a busy day. We waited approximately 15 minutes for the first elevator to come and once it did only 2 of us could fit on it, so while my friends waited for the next one I went and checked-out. I waited in line approximately 10 minutes to check-out, and the others had still not arrived. This was a headache because we had a shuttle bus to the airport waiting for us. Luckily we had a nice driver who waited patiently. The others finally arrived downstairs after 30 minutes of waiting. This is no exaggeration. If they hadn't of had so much luggage I daresay they would've walked down the stairs. And while they were in the lift someone ended up with motion sickness as the lifts drop very suddenly from such a great height.

The apartment was spacious, very nice, and like new, with great balconys, furntiture, etc., and they provide more than enough clean dishes, pots, etc to make great use of the apartment while there. 2. The room service I received was excellent. Daily they tidy up and provide more than enough new dishwashing and laundry detergents, towels, etc., and they often cleaned up thoroughly which even included doing any dishes that needed it at that time. 3. The amenities were superb. I used either the gym, pool, sauna, or whirlpool every day and they were always available and had great views. 4. The location was ideal. World Square at the ground level and beneath has lots of restaurants, markets, other shopping. I was also just a short walk to Darling Harbor, the Queen Victoria Building, Sky Tower, etc. The only drawback I saw is that parking can be expensive if you want to use a car ($30/day), no one ever did replace a lightbulb I had twice mentioned was out in my room entrance, and while the elevators are nice they can take some time waiting for one on weekends.

Great facilities - we regularly used the pool and gym (tip: our kids were too young to last the full wedding so we bought some DVDs locally and booked the little advertised and no-charge theatrette for a movie show. Big cheers all round!). You could not get a better central location with the monorail on your doorstep, a cab rank outside and the metro a few minutes walk. The nearby foodcourt en route to the Woolworth's in the basement of the shopping mall is great and we ate some of the best sushi we'd ever had. Some nice Spanish restaurants down the street too. Walk a few streets further and find the charming Chinese peace garden - a big hit with our girls. We were very pleased with our apartment which was an ideal base for our family and great value.

I was extremely disappointed after looking forward to this accomodation so much. We had problem after problem and not a single apology from any member of staff. There on the 3rd night of my honeymoon, my wife and I were made to feel utterly insignificant and not the least bit valued! We would have overlooked any of our problems individually but we had so many it was disgraceful. 1. We were told there was only one key for the appartment, the other had been broken (not a problem in itself but read on) 2. We were 'not' told that when we opened our appartment door there would be two rooms, an A and a B. When I opened room B (not knowing which was ours) I found there was already a person there asleep on the sofa. This was not our room yet our key opened the door!! 3. When I went to speak to someone at reception about this (clearly worried that other people could also get into our room) I was told 'Oh that would be so and so, he's alright, he's been here 10months.' Why would I be interested in this - I wanted someone to check the locks - nobody would do this initially. 4. The appartment itself did not match the description we were given in any way. Quote \"The apartments are spacious and are 5 times larger than most hotel rooms.\" The room was like a shoebox and certainly not 5*! 5. There was supposed to be a policy of keeping music down. Meriton warn that people making too much noise will be removed without a seconf chance. This was clearly not enforced as we had a neighbour blasting music during our whole stay there even after bringing this to the attention of reception. 6. After going up to have a swim we decided to have a shower. Unfortunately, the shower door was broken and we could not use this as it would have flooded the tiny bathroom. When we brought this to the attention of reception somone did fix the door but we had no apology and he said this happens often. I thought this was meant to be 5*? 7. While the guy was up fixing the shower I managed to convince him to try our key in our neighbours door. He didn't believe us at first but sure enough when he tried it the door opened. We were told they would check it out but not to worry - they were 'sure' nobody could open our door. 8. 9am the next morning... We were woken up with a guy with a suitcase standing in our doorway looking very puzzled! This was another guest who had been given the other key to our room (we were told it was broken - see point 1) and sent to our appartment! When we mentioned this we were told 'You're not having a good time at the moment are you?'. No apology! 9. I placed a towel on the towel rail (no force at all) and the rail came off the wall! 10. After trying to ignore all of this and stay positive we went to book a taxi to the airport. Would anybody book us a taxi? No, we were told 'If you just cross the street over there you'll be able to hail one down easy enough'. It took over 10 minutes to get one! Not something that you would mind if you had paid for cheap 2/3* accomodation, but in 5* appartments you would expect some assistance. Utterly disappointing!
