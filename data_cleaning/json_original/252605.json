When Mexicans travel to the city to go to the bullfights they stay here. The parking lot is filled every morning by businessmen arriving for breakfast meetings. I just got back from staying a month at El Diplomatico. The street side is noisy but the back side and annex are quiet. The higher floors get views. On the street side up high there might be a view of the snow capped mountains when the air clears. The rooms have safe deposit boxes but you have to ask for the key. The rooms have mini-fridges but check if it works before you accept a room. All the TV channels are Mexican but many have American shows with Spanish subtitles. English skills are poor throughout the hotel but sufficient at the front desk. I have experienced the rock hard mattresses but some rooms have pillow-top mattresses. I won\u2019t tell you which is my favorite room because I want it to be available when I come back. The hotel is on one of Mexico city\u2019s main streets, Insurgentes, and located about half way between the historical downtown and the charming neighborhoods of Coyoacan and San Angel. The Metrobus running up and down Insurgentes is clean and cheap. 20 pesos buys a reloadable pass good for a few trips. The bullring (spring and fall) and a soccer stadium are only a couple of blocks from the hotel. Next to the hotel is Parque Hundido for a stroll through a wooded park with replica pre-Columbian sculptures. On the side street just north of the hotel are a laundry and a Telcel cell phone store and couple of streets further north a Superama supermarket to get your toiletries, booze and snacks. Several blocks south is a big modern shopping centre with the Liverpool department store that has everything from socks to Smart cars. Lots of restaurants within a short walk such as 2 Japanese, 2 Chinese, 1 Danish, several Argentinean, 1 Italian, 1 American (MacDonald\u2019s), and many Mexican ranging from street tacos to Delicias, where you get a late night show of traditional Mexican singing and dancing.", "Date": "February 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Spokane, WA", "Title": "\u201cGood and bad, fine overall\u201d", "Author": "Dr.TMac", "ReviewID": "UR123179201", "Content": "I stayed at the Diplomatico for four days, and it was a mixed experience.

Very helpful staff (but it really helps if you speak Spanish). They were especially good about getting safe cabs to get around the city. Cons: The beds were clean but rock hard. LOUD!!! There are several clubs across the street, that play deafening music until 2-3am, and the street traffic kicks off at about 5:30 am. It would have been a nightmare for my kids, but it was bearable with earplugs. No free wifi No \"official\" access to a printer, (but a kind word and $10 pesos might convince a younger staff person to print your boarding pass for you).

Ghastly. Please dont even think about staying ehre - I suggest Hotel Vermont (same price, great service, lovely rooms) or El Greco if you're on a budget, or Holiday Express (even better location if you can afford just $20 more a day).

It was a very good experience because we wanted to stay in a hotel that were located in the middle between South Mexico City (Perisur, UNAM, Ajusco) and downtown-Reforma. One of the good things that has this hotel is that local transportation is just outside the door: the metrobus stop (an express bus that goes north-south through Insurgentes Ave.) was in front of the hotel, so we could take the metrobus and be in Reforma in just 15 minutes for $5 pesos each. There are also safe taxis that serve the hotel. The location of this hotel is very safe and there are lots of restaurants very close. Also there is a very nice park one block away. The rooms are big and very clean. All the furniture are in very good condition. The bathroom looked like it was remodeled short time ago. The only drawback of the hotel is that sometimes can get noisy mostly in weekends because Insurgentes Ave. is a very busy avenue.

The concierge was extremely helpful. All of the above makes the front desk receptionists a mystery; they were a real pain in the backside. They wouldn't change money, they wouldn't cash travelers' checks, and they didn't offer the help that most travelers consider routine of a front desk. I suspect that, because I was there on an Expedia flight-hotel deal (which made my room rate pretty low), the receptionists felt that I wasn't a \"real\" guest. There was no language miscommunication causing the poor service, as I speak Spanish. In sum, I would certainly stay there again, but I would not approach the front desk for help.

Since I was giving a presentation, the institute prepaid my room and made all the arrangements (so I can't comment on value, etc.) There were three people staffing reception when I arrived. It appears the reception desk also handled all telephone reservations and it did appear to be very busy with telephone calls. The person who checked me in was friendly and spoke a little English. Personally, I don't expect the rest of the world to speak English and with my two-dozen words of Spanish, I was able to communicate fine in my interactions with the staff. It does seem their room reservation system does have some problems as the receptionist checked me in to room 501. The bellhop picked up my bag and the key, saw the room number on the key and went back to the reception desk. There was a short conversation (I'm thinking something along the lines of \"I just took someone up to room 501, are you sure it's available?\") and then the receptionist issued me a key for room 701. During this time, there was much viewing of a complex display that appeared to a map that showed the status of every room in the hotel. The room was good-sized with two double beds, LARGE closet, desk by the window. Bathroom was good-sized with plenty of hot water. Housekeeping provided 2 bottles of water that were replaced every day. From the 7th floor there was a great view looking out over the city with the mountains in the background (when the smog finally cleared up). The hotel fronts on a very busy street and drivers love to use their horns there, so there is street noise. 7th floor was high enough that the noise was pretty minor, but if you are a light sleeper, I'd suggest asking for a room facing the back of the hotel. Bellhop showed me how the air-conditioning worked. AC unit was not noisy but it did blow directly on the beds so I turned it on when I left the room for the day and then turned it off before going to bed. Yes, the blankets are fuzzy and the sheets were not 300-count, but the bedding was clean and comfortable. The bed was firm (not hard in my opinion...I've slept on some HARD beds in budget hotels). The marble \"step\" a previous reviewer mentioned was a 1/2\" high ledge meant to keep the room from flooding in the event of a water problem. I also noticed a drain in the middle of the bathroom floor. It's not uncommon to see this in older hotels (in fact, when I travelled in eastern europe, it was standard to see these two things as the shower was typically not separate from the rest of the bathroom). The elevators are a little funky, but I've had worse elevator experiences. These elevators use a light beam/sensor to determine whether someone is entering/leaving the elevators. I noticed the bellhop using his hand to break the beam if the doors opened but no one broke the beam (ie, when the elevator arrived, and it was too full for the person to get on). An eccentricity that would cause people to think the elevator wasn't working. Breakfast in the restaurant was typical hotel, decent quality but overpriced for Mexico City. Service was OK, coffee at the table as soon as I sat down, waiter taking my order as soon as I closed the menu, food arriving fairly quickly. Once you get the waiters outside of their routine though, it was a problem. One morning, I started out sitting by myself and then had colleagues join me as breakfast went on. The last two people got coffee right away, but then after five minutes had to ask for a menu and then had to track down our waiter down to get their orders in to the kitchen. Overall, I would characterize this hotel as an older hotel (style strikes me as 1960's) that has been well maintained but not updated. Staff are typical: small problems here and there, but generally acceptable. I would definitely stay here again given my understanding that there are few hotels in this part of town. There are many restaurants in close walking distance and the MetroBus (running the length of Insurgentes) is a convenient and cheap way to get into town or to a subway station.", "Date": "November 2, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Baltimore, Maryland", "Title": "\u201cNot Horrible but not great either\u201d", "Author": "lbmore", "ReviewID": "UR19383333", "Content": "I stayed here in connection with a meeting so I didn't have much choice.

This Hotel is located near the Bullring \"La Mexico\" and the Soccer stadium. It is right across the street from Parque Undido. There are Plenty of restaurants within walking distance along Insurgentes Sur which is the main avenue in this area. It is about 25 mns away from the Airport when traffic is normal, otherwise it could take one hour during rush hour. The restaurant located on the second floor is not too good. Only to be used if you don't have time to go out. You can order domino's pizza for delivery. We arrived on Oct 25th with a reservation confirmation from the hotel garantied by credit card. We were told there was no room available because a group had decided to overstay. There was no manager on duty to speak to. We showed we were unhappy and argued firmly. We found out other guests were in the same situation as us. The Staff offered to relocate us at another hotel at the other end of town which was not acceptable to us. We eventually found, on our own, a room at the Fiesta Inn, not too far away but at a higher rate. The next day we returned to the Hotel early in the morning to speak with management. They made us feel stupid as if it were obvious they were right and we did not understand what had happened. We eventually were given the room we had reserved and after a long argument they accepted to pay half the excess price we had spent to stay at the Fiesta Inn. They should have paid for the entire difference and the cost of getting there and back and not argue about it. In fact they should have honored our reservation in the first place. We had a Suite with two queen beds. The Suite is very spacious and the bathroom is old looking but efficient with hair dryer. Standard double rooms are of a decent size with identical fixtures. Although everything in this hotel is old looking it remains in good shape. Rooms are decently sound proof. They work with their own cab and chauffeur. It cost us 1.000 pesos to have a chauffeur take us to Teotihuacan for the afternoon with a stop at the Basilica. The suite cost about 850 pesos per night with an early reservation on the hotel web site. Considering it is often difficult to get good service in Mexico hotels when something goes wrong, I would still recommend this hotel if you need to be in this area of town. Just be prepared to fight it out and defend yourself. Local restaurants worth trying and within walking distance are \"El Buen Bife\", \"El Candelero\", \"Konditori\", and less formal across the street from the hotel are \"Papa Bill\" and \"Freedom\".
