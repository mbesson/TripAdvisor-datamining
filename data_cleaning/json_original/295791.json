I have been to this property four separate times, and each has been consistently terrible. The ONLY reason I stay here while in Memohis is to continue earning HH points and stays. I should also note this is the first time I have ever bothered to write a review in reference to a hotel (or anything else for that matter); yes, it's that bad. Let's start with the hotel shuttle. Upon calling from MEM to request the shuttle, a rude woman will undoubtably answer the phone, ask for your reservation information (no other Hilton I know of does this), and will make you wait until the next shuttles leaves...in about hour. You might as well pay for a cab... Check in: long lines may or may not occur in this notably bizzarly designed and decorated lobby. If you are Hilton Gold or Honors, do not expect a better room or service...or for them to notice that you are a frequent customer. Room key: do not dare put it near your cell phone...or it will deactivate it. ROOMS: The carpet is filthy...in every room I've stayed in. Each room also had a drainage issue in the shower. I can't express how disgusting it feels to have the water full up to you ankles and to essentially wash in other people's filth. Also, the walls are apparently made of paper, because you can hear anything and everything your neighbors are doing. The glass is also thin, the nearby highway can be heard all night. There is essentially nothing good that can be said about these rooms...it's basically just a place to sleep...and everything feels dirty. The Restaraunt and Bar....OMG!!!!! Where to begin..... The resturant is like the twilight zone. Each time I have been, there have only been one or two parties present, and all are actively complaining about the service (rightfully so). Upon ordering a drink, you can expect 10 minutes of shear silence to go by ( there is no music or noise what-so-ever) until the waitress comes back and asks you to repeat the order. In another 10-15, they'll come with a lousy drink in a dirty glass. Tonight I ordered a meal from the \"healthy menu\". What a laugh!! It was pasta COVERED in pesto sauce to the point that it was ineatible. There was also supposed to be a full chicken breast...which turned out to be two small slices of what was obviously frozen ( dark) chicken. This cost $12 95. The waitresses and waiters have Ll been unprofessional and seemingly lazy. On my last stay, I ordered a salad from the bar (also about $13) it contained wilted lettuce , very, very little meat and was missing at least 3 other inclusions that the menu described. AND GET THIS: I had the nerve to order a Martini.... It came in one of those miniature martini glasses that you could buy for a quarter at big lots, was not nearly full, tasted God awful....AND COST 15 bucks!!!!! I live in downtown Miami, go out iften, and have NEVER paid more than 12 for the same drink (made 100 times better). Is this the outskirts of Memphis....or Manhatten?? What on earth are they thinking with these prices?? Club Level: A waste of time- the worst I've seen yet. And last time I was here, I walked in and out, had a cookie and a water...and the next day I observed a $9 alcohol charge!!!! It was taken off the bill, but still an aggrivation that took 20 minutes of an already rushed morning to solve. The strangest thing was that I never used my key or gave my room number to the attendent. Upon looking up the charge, the front desk person observed there was no guest signature...essentially some stranger just gave my room number and had my room charged....unbelievable. Basically, not only is this the worst Hilton I've stayed at, but one of the worst hotels I've ever been in in 33 years of living and a lot of travel. Next time I'm in Memphis, I'll likly forgo the HH points and stay at the Sheraton across the street.", "Date": "March 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Nashville, Tennessee", "Title": "\u201cVery Impressed\u201d", "Author": "zpb52", "ReviewID": "UR126500653", "Content": "I couldn't have asked for a better experience than at the Hilton Memphis. We booked online for New Year's Eve, and added the romance package. When we arrived back at the room from the Liberty Bowl game, our bottle of champagne was waiting for us on ice. The lobby staff was very friendly and helpful, as were the restaurant staff. I realized after I got home that I had left my phone charger in the room. I called the hotel, and they said they had found it. I was going to be driving through Memphis again in a couple of weeks, and I told them I would be by to pick it up. When I got there, I met with the head of housekeeping, who had my charger waiting for me. THAT'S service! Despite its obvious age, the hotel has been kept up very well and maintains a very contemporary feel, all the way from the lobby to the guestrooms. It's a very tall hotel, and the elevators move at a very quick speed, so there's not a lot of waiting most of the time. Our room was on one of the top few floors, so we had a great view! Unfortunately, there isn't a whole lot to look at on this side of town. There are a few shopping centers and many dining options nearby, making the hotel convenient in that regard, but it is a good distance outside the city center and tourist attractions of Memphis. It's also completely on the other side of Memphis from Tunica, so expect a 50-minute drive (at least) each way if you want to go gambling.

I wanted something reasonably priced, close enough to the airport, and where I could relax comfortably. The Hilton had all that and more. First of all, this was the most friendliest staff I have ever encountered in any hotel on the North American continent. (stand outs) The driver(s) to and from the airport were prompt, friendly, and dependable! Front desk personnel were there all the time and very helpful. The restaurant staff were on top of things and very service oriented. All the staff seemed happy to be there. The lobby downstairs is very open and relaxing. Nice place to just relax or wait for guest. There is a bar with attentive bartenders just in case you think to yourself \"Why not have a shot of bourbon?\" while decompressing from a day's travel. The rooms were comfortable and clean. The bathroom is smaller than most I have seen, but so what? It works and is clean. I must say I did turn on the shower without realizing the shower head was somehow turned out and directed toward my face like an hidden fire extinguisher. I was suddenly drenched and confused trying to figure out what was happening. LOL! After a few seconds, I realized the matter and simply turned the shower head back toward the \"inside\"of the tub. That woke me up and was just a matter of using two towels instead of one. The bed was perfect. The view was as panoramic as it could get considering the location. The little store was fully stocked with any sundries you may need, and more. Parking lot is wide open. You can tell this hotel really cares about it's guests and employees. No complaints. I will stay here again next time I come back to Memphis. Like another review, I did think the buffet was a bit overpriced, but then again, it is 'all you can eat' and can stay as long as they are bringing it out. I know because I asked. It was worth it. Here is a tip: It may take a few walks around the lobby to get used to the WC Handy statue just on the other side of the check in (as you make your way to the elevators). It is really cool with the background lights and all, but I was waiting for it to say something every time I walked by.", "Date": "March 17, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Birmingham, Alabama", "Title": "\u201cFantastic stay\u201d", "Author": "RW_Adair", "ReviewID": "UR125958539", "Content": "I was here for three nights on business.

The room was HUGE and the music was coming from a night stand radio!! The night manager harassed me... even after I turned it down. He stated that this room was for \"meetings\". I paid over $600.00 for the room and was harassed from the time I got there. It ended up a nightmare. There are a number of noise complaints and as nice as it seems you can hear everything from the shower in the other rooms to people talking in the other room.. even in the executive suites. They did NOTHING to fix these issues. The floors are somewhat slanted as well... almost a leaning tower. It's o.k. to stay there as a guest for one night on a quick trip but DO NOT use their executive suites or invite guest in your room. YOU WILL GET HARASSED! The walls are way too thin.

The first night the revolving door wasn't working but the next day it was - I don't really care about that because I used the glass sliding door which in my opinion is a lot easier to use than revolving doors! We stayed in a suite on the top floor - the hotel was booked solid but I NEVER heard my neighbors like others said. My only complaint is that the A/C unit on one side of the suite didn't work but with the nice weather it wasn't an issue for me. The breakfast is not worth the money so don't pay extra to get it.

We traveled to the hotel for a dance convention last weekend for the third year in a row. The first year we didn't have any problems. Room was OK, room rate was really inexpensive and breakfast was included. All was fine. Last year they were completely overbooked. People who had made reservations months before were turned away. This year they overbooked again! I arrived at 3:30 to secure our room and 2 other rooms. The front desk staff said that the rooms were not ready. It is clear that they do not have enough cleaning staff to turn over the hotel in a timely manner. The girl took down my cell phone number and said she'd call when they were ready. Not a huge deal, we left to go shopping and have dinner at The Avenue shopping center. At 5:30 I called to check the status. The room wasn't ready. I called back again at 6:30 and it was ready. No one ever called me to let us know even though she said she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d call. We arrived at the hotel around 8:00pm. The bellman assisted us with our bags. As soon as we walked out of the elevator on the 5th floor the smell of cigarette smoke slammed us! He opened the room and it was smoky! I am a loyal Hilton Honors customer and have non-smoking in my profile. He patiently waited while I called the front desk to find out why I was in a smoky room. She assured me that my room wasn't a smoking room. I don't buy it! It was terrible and had cigarette burns on the carpet. Since the hotel was overbooked, there was nowhere to move us. We stayed. The next morning my daughters and I woke up with stuffy noses and scratchy throats. The Saturday morning front desk staff were very nice and understanding. They found new rooms for us & my 2 friends on the 4th floor. They offered us a nominal discount, the free internet code and free breakfast coupons. While they found new rooms for us, there was no one to clean them. I packed up our stuff in the smoky room and waited 5 hours for the new room to be ready. The new room had fresh air, but the carpet was gross. This hotel needs a top to bottom renovation in the building. Windows are drafty, condensation develops on the inside and drips onto the carpet and the sound from one floor to the next travels through the glass walls. You can hear what your neighbors above & blow are doing in their room. The ventilation filtering system is inadequate. Smoke from our neighbors bathroom flowed into our bathroom vent while we were showering. Carpets are dirty, cigarette burned and the pile is crushed. If I had babies or toddlers, I wouldn't let them play on the floor in the rooms. Breakfast buffet is OK when you have a free coupon, but not worth the regular price. Not a lot of selections and the restaurant is woefully understaffed too. On a Saturday morning with the hotel full, there were 2 waitresses for the entire restaurant. I actually called the front desk from the restaurant to tell them that it was understaffed. After making the call 2 front desk staff members were in the restaurant busing tables! We were at the hotel for a dance competition. The convention facilities are adequate, but the staging is too low and the sound systems are terrible. You can't see the dancers at all. If I was organizing a dance competition, I would NOT use this hotel. I'm sure there are better facilities in the area. This hotel is in a business district. I would not stay here if I was traveling to Memphis for the tourist attractions. It is off the beaten path.

I don't expect white-glove service, but it's business travelers like their diamond members who keep Hilton afloat, so I do expect some level of decent service from them. When I checked in to this Hilton, at the Hilton Honors desk, no less, I received virtually NO acknowledgment...no \"welcome to Hilton\", no \"thank you for your loyalty,\" not even the crappy room-temperature bottled water. I was asked for my credit card, told where to sign and given my key packet. When I asked if there were breakfast coupons in my packet (I was on a government rate, which is supposed to include breakfast), he grunted, \"26th floor hospitality room.\" Wow, dude, sorry to have interrupted you on your day off! One of my colleagues checked in at the \"regular\" desk and was being treated like a long lost relative. He got his water, breakfast coupons and warm welcome and he's a gold honors member. So it's obviously not a universal bad-attitude issue at this hotel. The room was perfectly average. As with every round hotel I've stayed in, the rooms tend to be a little more compact than conventional hotels...there's not much leeway when you're constrained by the hotel's architecture. With a round hotel, it's all about the view from the floor to ceiling windows. The furnishings were adequate, the bathroom was a split-model version (vanity and sink outside the door, toilet and tub/shower inside). Water pressure was decent. The lighting over the vanity was horrible...I think the sconces had 20-watt fluorescent bulbs in them and there was no separate vanity mirror, so I had to do my morning face-painting sitting on the bed by the window with a compact mirror.

I finallly got around to staying there recently and found the guest experience to be pretty much on par with any full-service Hilton. However, I quickly discovered that there's a tradeoff for that cool exterior, and it's all about convenience. For example, the entrance to my room seemed narrower than usual - not that the door itself was narrow, but the opening was partially recessed behind a flange in the hallway wall. Although I was able to maneuver it OK, that might make access problematic for someone with a larger frame or anyone using an assistive device for mobility. Furthermore, the room was sort of pie-shaped and seemed smaller than the average Hilton room. I assumed these were both architectural concessions to the circular footprint of the building. Also, there is really only one non-emergency entrance/exit at this hotel. That may not seem like a big deal, but given enough entries and exits you might change your mind. Plus, if you like to park close to the side entrance of a hotel during a multi-day stay in order to cut down on the walk to and from...as I do...you're out of luck. Plus, the hotel's main entrance is accessed via a dedicated driveway at the top of a slight grade on the long, expressway-facing side of the hotel grounds. The vast majority of the hotel's parking is at the base of that grade at one end of the driveway. With this layout, you're pretty much guaranteed a long walk from your car to your room every time you come or go. Luckily, the weather was great during my entire stay, but if it had been raining (or worse) this inescapble long walk would have made me REALLY grumpy. Given the layout of this main entrance, I can only assume that anyone in a wheelchair would have to be dropped off at the hotel's entrance and then made to wait while someone else parked the car. This is the first time I can remember being hesitant to recommend a hotel because of the layout of its grounds, but that's my takeaway on this one.", "Date": "November 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Colorado Springs, Colorado", "Title": "\u201cA bit worn down, but ok for the price\u201d", "Author": "Thinker_to_go", "ReviewID": "UR119874642", "Content": "For a Hilton, to be honest, you'd expect a little better.

What's frustrating is when you think you're stepping up to a nicer class only to find the Hotel going through the motions of providing any real upgrade in amenities. The \"valet\" doesn't appear to work after noon requiring major effort on hotel staff if the service is requested anytime other than first thing in the morning. Self-park. No bellman or concierge. The obligatory hotel bar seems like an afterthought tended by the night auditor who'd rather be home. The \"free breakfast\" in the hotel restaurant was very I-Hop. The room. My assistant booked it as some sort of upgrade but I'm not clear what was better. It was small with a king bed, desk, media chest and chair in standard semi- contemporary blah.

When i arrived at the hotel after a 4 hour drive with kids and a grandmother....i was greeted at the front door by the nicest valet i have ever met. He was great. I entered the hotel to check in and was greeted (and i use that term lightly) by a young woman who assigned my room. i had the kids in a double stroller and headed off to the elevators. When i arrived on the very top floor, there was a stairway to reach the rooms. I could not very well go up a stairway to get to a room with a double stroller that weighed easily over 75 lbs (with the 2 kids strapped in). I went back downstairs to the front desk where i spoke to 2 young men about the situation. They acted like i had just ruined thier day and I was told that the hotel was completely booked and they were not sure if they could change my room. I was asked repeatedly if i had been to the room because if i had they could not change my room because they could not resale it. After i had assured them that as stong a woman as i am, that i had not picked up that stroller and taken it up the stairs nor had i left my kids alone while i went to the room that the room was air tight and i either needed another room or 2 men to help me up and down those steps as many times as needed with that stroller. Finally, I got a room. The air conditioner did not work properly in the room and they came to fix it twice and it never really worked. i had the thermostat set on 60 and it never really felt cool in there. Admittedly, it was exceptionally hot outside....it is Memphis in June afterall, but the air should have worked better. If i had been staying more than 1 night i would have had to have a different room or they would have had to actually fix the problem. The room was a little on the small side, but it was only 1 night and i could handle it. The hotel set up was not very accessible for the stroller (or for someone in a wheelchiar). The church convention events were on the \"P\" level and the only way to get there was by escalator (which i could not use) or by elevator. In order to get there by elevator, you had to go down and walk through the restaurant and back around to reach the event rooms. Thank goodness they did not lock the restaurant doors. But again i was only there 1 night so it was ok. The highlight of the trip was the waitress we had in the restaurant for breakfast. Her name was Sandra if memory serves and she was exceptional. She was so accomodating and sweet. She was really good at her job and it is because of her that i did not rate this hotel a 1. Overall, I will choose a different hotel the next time i go to memphis. Memphis is in the heart of the south and the front desk staff was not a very good representation of southern hospitality.

The property itself is fine. The location is in a suburban office park with many restaurants and other shopping a short drive away. It's not a great location to walk anywhere, though, unless you are working in one of the nearby offices. As a Diamond member, you'll receive a small paper sack at the front desk when you check in. It'll have two bottles of water and a snack. (Mine had caramel corn this week.) I thought this was odd, but I guess it lets them assign you a room when you check in rather than having to deal with preassigning rooms. I've yet to be greeted as a Diamond guest, or to be welcomed back as a returning desk. Although my Hhonors profile requests a room on a high floor, I'm typically placed on the 9th to 12th floor of this 27 floor property. There used to be an executive lounge on the 26th floor (according to prior posts on Flyertalk about the hotel), but it's no longer open. I took the elevator up to the floor to take a look, and there is a set of double wooden doors where it's clear a lounge used to be located, but they're locked up tight now and there are no signs. Very disappointing for a full-service Hilton. Since there isn't a lounge, you do get breakfast coupons. The breakfast buffet, though, was probably the lousiest I've ever encountered in a full service hotel. The selection was poor, and the quality was mediocre. I'd rate Hampton Inn's breakfast higher. Service was terrible too...I was served one small cup of coffee, and the server never stopped by to see if I needed a refill. When she did come by, she dropped the bill off, didn't ask if I needed anything else, and scurried off. I headed to Starbucks (not in the hotel, but nearby) afterward. As a Diamond, the Internet is free. It's unusual in how they manage the charges though. A code is printed on a sticker placed on the key envelope, and you must enter this code in your Web browser (under \"promotion code\") to get free access. If you lose your key envelope (as I did) and sign in as a \"normal\" guest, a charge will appear on your bill. (The front desk removed the charge, though, on request.) You must enter the \"secret code\" daily. Parking is free. There is a charge for valet parking, but valet parking isn't really that useful at this property. All parking is outside. Housekeeping is spotty. I fill the ice bucket every night. I've yet to have the maid empty the melted ice bag and replace it with a new one...I always have a \"bag of water\" to deal with when I get back to my room. I've also frequently encountered dirty water glasses left behind on night stands or by the sink. There is an Hhonors check in desk, but no one pays any attention to it. (That's typical though for SPG, Hilton, and Marriott at most properties.) The key and key packet are the same regardless of status. The rooms have LCD TVs. (The nearby Residence Inn and the Memphis Marriott on Thousand Oaks Boulevard still have old-style tube TVs.) Except for the LCD TV at the Hilton, I prefer the Marriott on Thousand Oaks Boulevard. That hotel does have an executive lounge, and the staff is very friendly and helpful. The staff at the Hilton is very indifferent.

The downs: the service was VERY hit or miss. Even though it was a Saturday night, and there was a wedding taking place in the hotel, they appeared to be woefully understaffed. Bellmen and valets for the car were nowhere to be found, which resulted in us being quite late to our dinner reservations across town...and this was in spite of calling the front desk TWENTY MINUTES ahead of time to request our car be brought around. Although we were never unpleasant or demanding, despite having several very annoyed moments during the weekend, the front desk staff was brusque and off-putting, and generally had an air of being put out to have to deal with guests...or with us, at any rate. We also found that the power outlets in the suite's bathroom were inoperative, and thus we were unable to use hair drier, flatiron, etc...AFTER we had showered, were unclothed, and were trying to race to get to dinner. Perhaps not a big deal to a male guest but for a woman trying to dress (quickly) for an elegant night on the town... Catastrophic! Aargh! Room service was a bright spot.

As someone who is an employee in an historic boutique hotel, I know that special touches are what makes a guest's stay memorable. There was nothing special about this hotel. Check in was just a process with no real greeting and at check-out we were treated just the same. We never valet parked (we used their free parking) yet we ended up having to pay for one night of valet as that was the only night they could take off (it was a 2 night stay). And no reason could be given as to why we were being charged for something we never used. I also faced issues at check-out with incidental authorization charges that should never have occured. Again, I work front desk in a hotel so I know what I'm talking about when I say that this hotel DID incorrectly charge me. And no attempt was made by any of their staff to resolve those issues. The room itself: while it was 15 flights up and had an amazing view of Memphis, the wall separating our room and the next guests were PAPER THIN and we could hear EVERYTHING. With a pool being 15 flights below you'd think you wouldn't be able to hear all the screams and yelling coming from there. But guess what? You can.

Was told I had a reservation (made about 3 weeks earleier) but no rooms were available. They took my cell phone number and said they would call when a room was available. They explained they had not had time to clean alll the rooms. Posted check out time is 11:00 AM. I explained to the clerk that this was a Valentine's Day weekend outing with 5:45 PM dinner reservations. We wanted to shower and change before dinner. She suggested that we change in the lobby restroom. I asked to speak to a manager explaining that we could change in a restroom at a gas station. We paid for a room at a Hilton. Ballancia Hayes, supposedly a manager, came out but offered not assiatance except to promise that I could get my room key from her when we returned from dinner. We received two phone calls during dinner telling us our room was ready, one call for us and one for a Mr. Tanner. When we returned at 8:00 PM. Ms. Hayes was talking to a couple at the kiosk (for about 18 minutes). We were in line behind them. When she finished with the couple, she simply turned and walked back into the office. I asked rather loudly to the other 2 clerks at the kiisks if I could get keys to the room that I should have had at 4:00 PM since Ms. Hayes was not providing service. One of the clerks came down and provided keys. We finally got a room after our un-showered dinner. The key envelope said a bill copy would be under our door by 5:00 AM. If it was satisfactory, we could leave our keys in the room. When we left at 9:30 AM, no copy was there. When we reached the lobby, a porter with a luggage dolly followed by a large female tattooed employee with a tray, shoved the dolly through the door at us before we could get out. The female employee looked at us oddly and asked what floor. We said lobby if you can let us out. The porter moved the dolly over just enough to let us through the door. I left the keys at the check out desk and explained that we did not get a bill copy under the dooor. The female at the check out desk replied in a loud sarcastic voice, \"I'm sorry! Goodbye! Have a nice day\" Rather than argue with another rude employee, I left without a bill copy. I fully expect to argue later with a fouled up billing --- like everything else. The porter at the door was polite. One other elderly porter near the check in desk was polite. Every other hotel emplloyee that I encountered was a rude as I have ever experienced at a hotel. Atay at a Motel 6 if necessary. Do not subject yourself to this hotel. The building is nice. It was a favorite of ours when we were younger at the hotel was under different ownership. Our stays since Hilton took it have found horrible check in situations and rude employees but nothing to compare with this visit. Our younger memories of this as a special place are gone.

I thought from booking my managers in the Hilton all the time, that this was a quality hotel. Maybe when you have the Hilton Honors point you get a better room. However, because I was part of a convention of 500 - 1000 people, maybe they just did whatever. Sadly, I found the following dissatisfying qualities: * I was in a room with my two kids, and our room wasn't being cleaned every day until another family member mentioned it to housekeeping. * When my washcloths and towels were restocked, they would only put two washcloths and towels to replace the dirty ones they took. It was 3 people in my room, so clearly I needed 3 washcloths & 3 towels daily (if not more). Guest services said that since another convention ahead of ours had \"problems w/ removing the towels / rags and taking them to the pool\" that if we needed additional rags other than the 2 they initially bring, then we would need to call the front desk each time there was a need. * I called the front desk to get more towels / rags, and warned front desk that I may not be in the room, but for them to still have someone bring them in. Left room for about 4 hours and came back - still no clean rags / towels. * There was NO complimentary internet service in the hotel rooms. If you're going to be a 3 - 4 star hotel, how can you not have complimentary internet service for your customers? That is not good. The only available area to use computers was the business office, and that was only for emergencies or visiting professionals. So, you couldn't just use the computers in there for an extended period of time. * The ice machine on my floor was broken for the first 3 - 4 days of my stay. I guess they felt there was no need to rush and fix it. I hope this is hopeful for someone.

The training facility was nice too, all equipments were in working condition and clean. The breakfast was very good too, because of my Diamond VIP status I got free full buffet, so that was good for me... And now to the customer service part and the hotel staff; to put it plainly, the hotel staff at this hotel was bunch of incompetent people that had no idea how to do their job. Here is what happened in my case. I check in with my gf, and after 10 minss, thee front desk person gives me my room keys for room 2704. So we go up to room 2704, try my key cards 10 time each, but they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work. So I go back to the front desk, and it turn out he had given me the wrong information, my room was 2613 ( but they put your keycards in a \"Sleeve\" sort of thing, and the printed room # on that was 2704). So I go to 2613, key works and we go in. I asked to get somee extra coffee, never recieved it. about an hour later, my girl was in the shower and I was in my boxers working on my laptop, I hear a knock on the door, and as I get up to go open the door, the door opeens and some lady hotel employee walks in and hands in my gift( because of diamond VIP I get some small basket with water, choclate etc). And the lady never apologized for just bursting in my room. I was like WTF?!?!?so anyways, we go to bed and fall asleep. And then I wake up to the sound of someone breaking into our room, I dont know if we're trying to get robbed or something, but I see the guy thats trying to enter the room, he had his suitcase and travel stuff with him. It then hits me that they probably made the same mistake with him. It turned out he was on the 25th floor nott the 26th, BUT THE SCARY PART WAS THAT THEY HAD ACTUALLY GIVEN HIM THE KEY TO OUR ROOM!!! inmy case, my key didnt open to wrong room, but in his case, they gavee him the wrong room, and HIS KEY WAS ABLE TO OPEN OUR ROOM!!! needless to say , we couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sleep till like 4 in the morning. I woke up at 5:30 to go to the fitness center, after I was donee with my workout (around 6:15am), I went to the front desk to let them know what happened. The first Lady I talked to ( I think her name was Marciella or something like that), and her response was basically \" SO?\", \"what do you want me to do about it\"? so I toldd her I want to speak with manager. she told me the manager wont be in till 8:30 but I can talk to the supervisor ( I think only her job title was \"Supervisor\", but in actuality it was \"blind leading another blind\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd sort off situation). So I talked to the supervisor, I told her what happened, at first she seemed helpful. I told her I want the room changed, because I dont know how many others have keys to my room. shhe agreed, she told m she has a room available, and while I go have breakfast, she'll do the paperwork. So we have breakfast, go pack up my stuff in my room, go ddownstairs to get my room changed. Again,( that Marcielala or Marshella or something like that), I talked to her, and mind you, my room shouldd have beeen ready by now, she peent 10 mins doing something on her computer, and I kept telling her what the holdd up, but she never answered. At that point I was likee F^&$ it, I just left my luggage with her, told her im gonna go attend some work I had to do, and that she can just have thee bellman take my luggae to my room when it because available.(this is around 7:30 am). I get back from work around 1:00pm and ask for the keys to my new room, and it turns out, I still didnt have a new room. The person I talked to was a Columbian girl, and out of all the incompetent employees, she was by far beetter than all of theem ( but still not so great). So I still didnt have a room, they had assigned room 2714 to me, and the lady was cleaning the room ( mind you, my new room should have been ready by at least 7am). so I literally stand there for 30 mins, just waiting to get my room cleaned, and meanwhile, the supervisor that I talked to this morning, she comes as well. She says as a result of what happened, she can take the charge for one night off of my hotel stay ( a value of $100+). I told her that it woulddnt do that mucch help to me, because my company pays for it, so it doesnt matter. she said she can give complimentary dinner for me and my girrlfriend. Sounded good. The hotel food was expensive, we didnt but the most expensive stuff on the menu. I got a steak entre', and she got Buffalo wings as room service. Theey brring us the food, but only silverware for ONE person. im like WTF, we order TWO entres and just get one set of silverware and glass of water? and on top of that, apparantly, the complimentary dinner was valued at $40 ONLY, and thee ffood came out to $60 ( yeah that expensive for just regular entre plus the buffalo wing), so I had to pay the rest out of my pocket. Again, I was like WTF!?!?! theey were willing to give me hotel night off (value of $100+ ), but in exchange they tricked me into a complimentary dinner for 2 ( but NEVER said 40$). in the past 2.5 years, I hav stayed at 100+ hotels and maybe 300+nights of hotel stays, and never had I encountered such a bunch of incompetent staff. and its not like one or 2 of the emplyess were incompetent, its turns out MOST of theem were bad....

I'm a Hilton Hhonors VIP, so I have a minimal standard expectation of a Hilton property. This one missed the mark by miles, even when accounting for the generally substandard level of customer service one finds in Memphis as a whole. After arriving, I spent the first 35-40 minutes of my stay trying to get the hotel staff to give me a room that had been properly serviced by housekeeping. The first room had been smoked in, despite the hotel's non-smoking policy. The second room had beds that weren't made at all. The third room's bathroom had obviously not been cleaned - there were icky remnants of the previous guest in and on the toilet, and there was also a large, very noticeable buttprint in the bedspread of one of the beds. The fourth room didn't have anything horribly wrong with it at first glance (although I was to find out later that my first impression was incorrect), so I stuck with that one. During this entire ordeal, I never received a single apology from the front desk staff; nor did they do anything about the fact that I was carting my luggage back and forth and up and down during all the room-changing fun. The rooms weren't the only thing that needed cleaning - the hallways and elevator lobbies were strewn with trash, and looked like they hadn't been vacuumed in a month at least. This, despite my stay being in the middle of a work week. The \"high-speed\" wireless internet service was $10/night, but it was actually low-speed, and dropped several times during the evening. Room cleanliness was marginal, and I found that housekeeping had taken several shortcuts, forgotten or overlooked things, and had done things that I found disgusting: - Ony one of the beds had been recently serviced - the other had dust and crumbs on it. It had obviously been untouched in quite a while. - Numerous items were overlooked - there was no shampoo, only one washcloth, and only one large towel. This was in a 2-double-bed room! - There was a partially-consumed bottle of water on the TV stand, with the \"you will be billed $4 if you drink it\" tag still attached. - The coffee cups for the in-room coffee maker smelled exactly like the room's complimentary bar soap. It was clear that the coffee cups had been \"cleaned\" in the room with bar soap, probably used soap left by a previous guest. I called Guest Services to ask them to address these issues, but the person who answered the phone spoke with an accent or speech impediment that made him impossible to understand. I have lived in many parts of the world, and have spent numerous years living in the Southeastern US, but I could not understand a word this man said. I can't imagine what would cause Hilton to choose this staffer to answer phones. I tried to explain to him what the issues were, but I could not understand his responses. We ended the call with me unsure whether he was going to do anything to resolve the problems. No one ever showed up to fix anything, so my question was ultimately answered. The only thing positive I can say about this hotel is that it is right off I-240, which makes it easy to get to. I will not ever stay there again, and I strongly recommend that this place be avoided.

It depends on the time of day, level of business, and if you are recognized as a frequent guest. Take the elevator, any of the four, and you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll hear creaks and groans and squeaks on the ride up. But glass wall provides a pleasant view of the area. Once in the rooms, and I have stayed in well over a dozen in last the 4 months, all could use some renovation. The bathrooms are big enough but I am often annoyed with the spotty water pressure in the showers. The carpets universally need replacing as do the drapes. Housekeeping is also hit or miss, and maybe more miss than hit. You never know what they will skip. Sometimes it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s replacing the towels, sometimes it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the coffee. Once I got back to the room to find the bed left unmade while everything else was done very well. I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t understand how someone doing a completely rote task like making up a room can vary so much. The restaurant, Rook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Corner, has a nice breakfast buffet with a good assortment of foods. You can get most diets covered between the buffet and the omelet station. Most of the wait staff is pleasant and accommodating. I had dinner at the lobby bar once but the barkeep was sullen and the noise level was high and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve not tried it again. The gym is another area that is showing its age. Like many Hilton properties, the equipment is from Precor, quality gear. There is also an array of machines and accessories for your workout. But nearly every machine needs maintenance or repair. And, again, the housekeeping is hit or miss. Some days there are towels, some not. The water cooler went empty two days during one stay.

We left and went and had dinner and when we returned we did have a room. The elevators took forever both that night and in the morning. The room was fine, nice beds and linens. But the bathroom was less than immaculate (dark lines in the grout), the door only closed if you put your entire body against it to latch (my two small children could not latch it at all) and the light on the desk was burnt out (apparently housekeeping doesn't check lightbulbs). My husband again asked for a manger when we checked in and was told he would be called. At 9:30 p.m. he went BACK to the Lobby and said he'd wait. They sent over the front desk director (who he had spoken with earlier and couldn't do anything) and he stated (again) that he wanted the manager. He finally did get to talk w/this person and we were given complimentary breakfast buffets (which was marginal, runny eggs and luke-warm french toast). Not impresed and honestly I wouldn't go back.", "Date": "July 7, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "TN", "Title": "\u201cHilton steps up\u201d", "Author": "andy_tn", "ReviewID": "UR16203040", "Content": "Great hotel, all around.

First of all, let me say that this is a wonderful place to stay. The lobby is very nice and very modern, with lots of glass, bright colors, a nice fountain, and several LCD TVs to watch while you wait. The front desk staff was very friendly and extrememly helpful, as they went above and beyond to accomodate my needs. I asked for a lower level room, and I was promptly given a room on the main floor, just around the corner from the lobby. This was very convenient for us. The room was great as well. VERY comfortable bed, nice furnishings, and very very clean. Hilton once again lives up to its reputation in this regard. The breakfast buffet is also wonderful, and I would encourage others to add it to your room reservation when you book. They only added $10 total to our bill for 2 breakfast buffets, and I saw that they charge $13 per person if you just go in and order the buffet in person. The cooks were extremely friendly, and the spread for breakfast was quite extensive, with plenty of hot, cooked-to-order food and tons of fresh fruit, etc. I would stay at this hotel again in a heartbeat, and will probably return again the next time I'm in Memphis.

When I pulled up to the door, a Bellman was at my car with a cart before I could even get out.

It was large and expansive, and had a very elegant look and feel. When I checked in, the checkin was quick and easy. I requested a King Size room and was immediately moved to the room of my choice. I then went back to the car and got my things. I moved my car to the free parking area (Valet was also an option, but I opted to park myself as there was parking right in front of the door.) The Bellman then took me to my room, which was ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL. The room did NOT look like a Hotel room at all. The furnishing were beautiful and the room was decorated to give it a nice \"at home\" feel. There was a luxurious King Sized Bed, and well laid out work desk with a VERY COMFORTABLE upscale desk chair. (Complete with free, very high speed wireless internet). The room also had a comfortable easy chair with ottoman, lots of lighting, and a LARGE Closet with safe. The bathroom area was large and the double sink was outside the bathroom in a alcove next to the closet. Toilet and tub were in their own \"room\". The large screen TV would swivel so that you could see it from the Bed, the Chair, or the Desk. I opted to order Room Service for my evening meal. It was delicious and QUICK. (They promised 30 minute delivery and got it to me in about 12 minutes.) I also ordered breakfast to be delivered to my room by placing an order form on the outside doorknob before 1am. I stated the time I wanted breakfast delivered, and it came at exactly the time I ordered. As a side note, when I called Room service to place my order, they answered the phone by asking me how they could help me. . . and by calling me BY NAME! I was truly impressed. The staff at the hotel went out of their way to take care of my every need, and they did this with a smile on the their face, and in their voice.
