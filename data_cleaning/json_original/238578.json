I booked the hotel online through the DFDS site which had a deal on for two nights on the ferry and one in Amsterdam. As there was a budget the Acro Hotel was the first picked from the list for being within budget and having great reviews. ROOMS The reviews stated that the rooms were small and basic, which was true, but didn't matter as we were only there for a night. We stayed on the ground floor of the hotel which looked out onto a backyard piled with rubbish - so we kept the curtains drawn. The room was basic and consisted of; a double bed, TV on the wall, mirror and wardrobe. The bathroom was well planned out and practical, about 2-3m long, it had a toilet at one end and shower cubicle at the other separated by a mirror. Power shower when full blast applied definitely wakes you up after a ferry and bus ride! STAFF The men on reception were extremely helpful and even let us leave our bags there on the last day free of extended stay charges whilst we explored the city. There was a slight glitch when we went to collect our bags in the form of a power cut, but again the staff proved their excellent customer service by loaning us torches and allowing us to use separate rooms for toiletry purposes. LOCATION The location was great; not too far a walk from the main attractions, but far enough out of the main bustle of stag and hen do's. At the end of the road was the Rijksmuseum and 'Amsterdam Sign' which is a great photo opportunity. At the other end of the road was the House of Bols and designer shops including Chanel. On the first night we were a little lost and using a guide map managed to find the city centre (be aware of pick-pocketers), which is just past the Hard Rock Caf\u00c3\u00a9 about 5 minute walk from the hotel. In the centre there are theatres, restaurants, McDonald's (be prepared to pay for the toilet in McDonald's, as with most eateries in Amsterdam), supermarkets and shops like H&M and Pandora as well as tram line connections around Amsterdam. A 10-15 further walk into the city there's Madame Tussads, well worth a visit for visitors of all ages. Alternatively a 15 minute walk from the hotel or 5 minute tram ride from the centre in between the variety of coffee shops is the Red Light District. A part of the Europe that really has to be visited at night \u00e2\u20ac\u201c if not squeamish of bikini clad women paraded behind glazing or an individual prone to giggles. We spent some time in one of the pubs in the centre of the Red Light District, with budget prices of 2 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 4 Euro considering the location! OVERALL This hotel did the job: 1 night in decent enough a hotel in Amsterdam on a budget. Impressed by the bonuses of; helpful staff, budget price and great location, I'd definitley book the Acro Hotel again for another adventure in Amsterdam.", "Date": "October 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cPleasant surprise\u201d", "Author": "Atrotter", "ReviewID": "UR118189173", "Content": "I was very positively surprised about Acro Hotel in Amsterdam.

The bathrooms in some rooms are extremely small (specifically room 202, though the bathrooms in 204 and 209 were of a decent size).

It's a budget hotel in Amsterdam so obviously prone to lively groups of young people holidaying together. The sound proofing isn't great and the beds can be a little creaky so not exactly the place for a romantic getaway. Breakfast is self service in the normal Dutch style and what it lacked in choice it made up for in quantity and quality.

I really liked the location this hotel. It is on a tree-lined street that is very quite, mostly residential, and has very little traffic. It feels like Brooklyn Heights or the older portions of the Upper East Side. And yet as soon as you start working north from this area, you begin to enter the core areas of the old city. The Leidesplein area, which is thick with bars, restaurants, and shops is basically a couple of blocks away, but none of its commotion is evident from this hotel's quiet street. Continue north the Leidesplein to explore the rest of Amsterdam. The downsides of this hotel also stem to the fact that it's an older building. Rooms are quite small. My double was about 2 meters / 7 feet wide, leaving about 45 cm / 18 inches to walk by the double bed. Rooms also don't have great sound separation, so you should talk to your neighbors and kindly ask them to refrain from sex during your stay.

You can take the Tram 5 and get off at Hobbemastraat and the hotel is 2 minutes away. The happening area that is Leidseplein is 5 minutes by walk. The hip Jordaan area is about 10 minutes by walk.

On top of this, the hotel offers a luggage storage service so even after check-out, you are welcome to store your luggage leaving you free to further explore the city.

Unfortunatey my high expectations were short lived. My girlfriend and I were placed in the room next door to the 24-hour bar, reception and baggage storage and it was so small a hamster would have trouble getting in. The bathroom was also tiny. As you can imagine the first night sleep was non-existant! I went to reception to ask if it was possible to move to another room due to the excessive noise levels coming from the bar. The member of staff was slightly bemused that I found the noise level to be troublesome. Thankfully after pleading we were given a twin room for the night and would be moved to another double for the remaining 2 nights. Lucky that this was the case as the constant banging and dripping of the heating pipes again caused problems sleeping. The third room was much better thankfully with it being slightly bigger including the bathroom and being on the fourth floor. However, I wouldn't reccommend this hotel for couples as the excessive noise levels coming from groups running the corridoors all night was annoying. The breakfast area can get extremely overcrowded with a lack of seating during the last hour of breakfast so I would suggest you go down as early as possible i.e. 7 or 8am. The hotel itself is situation in a quiet neighbourhood close to the van Gough museme. Amsterdam is a very small city and it can be walked from top to bottom in 45 minutes no problems. The hotel is just a short stroll to the main shopping area and bars although you could take the tram if needed. The steps within and leading up to the hotel are so steep that you are almost walking vertical however, I think this is the case for most hotels due to Amsterdam's structure of houses, tall and thin.

However the hotel is well situated if you wish to visit the museums. The Van Gogh Museum and Riks Museum are both within walking distance. For the lager louts amongst us, the Heineken Brewery is within walking distance and well worth a visit. I also recommend a visit to Anne Frank House too, a very moving experience. A canal trip is also worth doing but I would personally book it nearer to Dam Square. Going back to the hotel, the rooms are very small, the beds are small and uncomfortable, being 6ft 2\", I was falling out of them a lot. The bathroom was okay but again very small, not much room to swing a cat! The stop cock under the basin was dripping when I was there, so I repaired it (being a plumber by trade) told reception, but they did buy me a beer for my troubles. At night time, the staff shift pattern changed and they seemed like that they could not care less about anything, with one of them having a mobile phone permanently glued to his ear, all the time.

The staircases are very steep and winding although there is a suitable lift which we \"oldies\" took from the fourth floor whilst our grandsons insisted on racing up and down the staircase - they beat us everytime!! The beds were very comfortable and the rooms quiet (although the local builders started work on the rear yard of the opposite house at 7.30 am with a pneumatic drill - not the fault of the hotel though!). The en-suite showerooms/WCs are small but clean and tiled and the lobby of the hotel has some interesting furnishings including an old-fashioned British telephone box and a row of aircraft seats! There is also an internet terminal and a rather pleasant bar which stays open as long as you need it. A useful service is the luggage store where you can leave your cases both before, and after, checking in or out. The breakfast room is in the cellar, down another flight of stairs, and the breakfast is a rather pleasant and substantial buffet. As has been mentioned in other reviews, it seems to be best to wait until after 9.30am as there was virtually no-one else having breakfast at that time and there was ample left. The hotel is situated in a quiet, attractive, leafy street and is very convenient for the museums and the canalbus landing from which you can gain access to all parts of the city very easily. The trams also stop at the end of the street and if you wish to stretch your legs, the park is just two blocks away (although there are some very eccentric characters there, believe me!). There aren't a great selection of eating places in the immediate vacinity; however, one of the staff directed us to the nearest McDonalds which is in a part of the city surrounded by shops, clubs and restaurants and has a lively night life - its only about half a mile from the hotel across a canal. Amsterdam as a city is very pleasant to visit and seems easy to get around, being, of course, virtually flat apart from the bridges. We didn't visit the \"red light district\" (what our grandsons would have made of the \"ladies in the windows\" would have been interesting!) so we felt safe everywhere. However, I felt that, with small children, it could be one of the most dangerous city's in the world! Whilst being largely free from lorries and most traffic, the central area has car, tram and bike lanes, all seperate and all going in different directions. Our grandchildren, both trained to watch for traffic coming from one direction and in one lane, were nearly bowled over on several occasions by the hundreds of bicycles travelling fast in both directions on the bike lanes and the trams which are very silent as they approach - just a small point but worth remembering if you are taking under-teen children. All-in-all, I found the Hotel Acro to be very pleasant and conveniently sited.

I would definitely recommend this hotel to people on a budget looking for a nice, clean, and quiet place to stay. It is not a price that I would consider budget in the U.S., but everything in Amsterdam is expensive.", "Date": "April 25, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Amble, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cenjoyed the stay\u201d", "Author": "Debj1967", "ReviewID": "UR4476762", "Content": "We have just returned from the Acro last night, we found the hotel to be very clean although the rooms were very small.

The rooms are very small, but you get a ensuite shower room and storage space, and a beds a bed! For a 2star hotel I thought it was brilliant.
