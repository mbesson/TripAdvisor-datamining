{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Friendly Folk at Masaccio Very cheap, comfortable and clean accomodation, within 25 minutes walk of all the main attractions but out of the tourist loop. 5 mins walk from the No. 7 bus stop to Fiesole.

The room was large and we had a bathroom, but the bathroom was the shower so after I took a shower, the entire bathroom was wet. Also, we had a couple mosquitos in the room that chewed up my neck and the room was close to the hotel balcony and smoke would seep into our room when people would step outside to smoke. Also, the hotel did not have an elevator. Pros:Close to train station, large room, large bed, friendly host.Cons:Not within walking distance to sites, bathroom, mosquitos, no elevator, and room near balcony which led to smoke in room.", "Date": "Jun 5, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR676609644", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "KoreanFood"}, {"Content": "Budget friendly hotel in Florence near Syracuse Unviersity Florence center       Edy Restaurant - Piazza Savanarola, - one block from Hotel Masaccio", "Date": "Mar 21, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR935317342", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "earl2244"}, {"Content": "Dishonest staff!!

I have stayed there several times. It's not a lot of frills, but it is impeccably clean and the owners of the hotel are always there and willing to help - and make you feel very comfortable.

Owners have a basic understanding of english, but have a complete understanding of hospitality and courtesy. The hotel is just far enough out of the center of town to detach it from the chaos, but not so far as to be inconvenient from the sights. It is immaculate, pleasant and comfortable and I would easily recommend it to a friend, especially if they are considering an arrival by automobile, as it is one of the few neighborhoods that is approachable by car.
