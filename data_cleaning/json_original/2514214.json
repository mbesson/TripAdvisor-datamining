They'll serve you from their little well-stocked bar any time day or night and help with any other requests. We stayed on the top floor (there is some street noise from a block away, but after the first night we didn't notice it) which does involve a 4 flight hike, but this is easily tolerated.

Yet located in a quiet road, with easy reach to basic food and services. Oxford Street (Selfridges side) is a pleasant 7 min walk. The hotel is tastefully furnished. We chose the Comfy Room which was cosy and the details such as choice of toiletries, beverages in the rooms, bedding standards just reflect the quality behind the style. But the heartbeat must be the personal service that made us feel at home, safe and taken care of. Whether it is the earnest receptionist who (without asking) helped with the luggage, or the attentive staff at the breakfast table, it is these efforts and thoughts that go such a long way in reminding we made a right accommodation choice, and more importantly making the holiday so memorable.

Their Swanky rooms are quite a good size for London hotel rooms, so I would strongly advise booking one of those, even though they are the priciest on their list: we paid 245 pounds per night (which is not that expensive for London) but it was completely worth it because the room came with a big bathroom and it connected with our toddler's Comfy room (perfect for kids or one person but too small for a couple) on the first floor.

This hotel seem to received high recommendation consistently, so I decided to give it a try and I couldn't have made a better decision! The location - Initially, I was concern about its location (when viewed from google map, it looked a little \"remote\"), particularly with regards to safety issues (our trip took place just a week after the London riot). But alas, my concerns were all allayed. The hotel is located just 7 - 8 min. from the Baker Street station, which has good links to various parts of the city. It is also only a mere 10 min. walk to Oxford street or 5 - 6 min. walk to the lovely Marylebone High Street. Even though the hotel is located at a very quiet area, the surrounding area is well lit & we felt very safe on a couple of occasions when we walked home from the restaurant or tube station, after 10pm. The service - One of the best I've ever experienced. Very warm, friendly and responsive staff. There was nothing that they wouldn't do to make our stay a comfortable one - they printed out road maps for us, recommended restaurants, walk down the street to get us the taxi (one needs to walk some distance to get a taxi, as our hotel is not located along a main road, but the hotel staff always managed to find them with little effort though) etc. Only tiny comment is, when I made the reservation, I told them that we were there to celebrate our 11th year wedding anniversary. They took note of it but did not go the extra mile to do anything special for us. It would have made a lot of difference, even if they had given us just a simple welcome & congrats note. The room - We arrived early on the check-in day (at 10am). Our room was not ready yet (as expected), and we were offered to have some coffee while they get our room ready. But we decided to leave our luggage at the lobby and take a walk along Marylebone High Street. We received a call from the hotel at 11.15am, to inform us that the room was ready! After a long flight, it was good to be able to check in early to freshen up. As for the room, we stayed at Swanky room, which was the largest room available. The room was located at the top floor (3rd floor). As the hotel doesn't have lift, the climb is not exactly easy. We did not mind as we thought the exercise would be good for us, but I think this can be a deterrent factor for certain guests. I would suggest that you make specific request for lower floor room, if need to. However, the upside of staying at the top floor is - our bathroom comes with sky roof! Is was awesome! The room & the bathroom were large, clean, modern (minimalist style), just like what was shown in the hotel website (as we all know, some hotel's website photos might be deceiving). The bed was very, very comfortable and I rested very well every night. I am a light sleeper and really appreciated the fact that the street was quiet and the rooms have thick wall, so we could hardly hear any noise from neighboring rooms. However, I did find some very, very minor issues with the room: 1) There are only THREE hooks in the entire bathroom. So, there is not even sufficient \"slots\" to hang the 2 bathrobes and 2 bath towels. Therefore, my husband and I constantly struggled to find space to put our clothing, face towels etc. 2) There is very limited counter top space. Again, my husband and I faced substantial challenges in finding (dry) space to put our toiletries. 3) the ipod / iphone (?) docking machine didn't seem to work well with my iPhone. Maybe it was meant only for iPod, but it worked on the 1st day, so I don't know why it failed on me later on. I did not bother to complain as it was a small matter for me. It managed to charge my phone though. If you want a hotel with all the amenities like gym, swimming pool, restaurants etc., then this is not for you.

There's a big bowl of apples when you come through reception and plenty of complimentary hot drink choices in your room. Wifi is free and works well.

Most of the time you'll find yourself in a hotel, that is just ok but you'd rather not stay longer than needed and moreover you pay more than it's worth. If you're looking for an amazing, gorgeous and stylish boutique hotel with a great price-value and a lovely and very helpful staff then it's definitely The Montague Place Hotel you should stay at on your next London trip. The perfect hotel: Until now we've stayed two times at the Montagu Place Hotel, once in July last year (for five nights) and a second time just a couple of days ago (from March 16th to March 19th, 2010) after our trip to Barbados. We found this gorgeous hotel thanks to Google and Tripadvisor and we don't have to look any further for another hotel. We've found the perfect hotel and to us it is 100% sure that whenever we'll stay in London on a private basis we'll stay at the Montague Place Hotel. (Unfortunately our employers do book different hotels for the business trips, so we won't be able at the Montagu Place Hotel for business trips :-(!!). The room: As you all might be aware, there are three different kind of room type at Montague, the Comfy, the Fancy and the Swanky rooms. On our first time we chose the Fancy and our second time the Swanky room. We were pleased with both rooms. The only difference between the two room types is the slightly higher price for the Swanky room, the size of the room itself, the bed such as the bathroom/toilet. I must admit we both loved the bathroom in the swanky room! Spacious and very bright plus some nice Molton Brown toiletries (in the other rooms as well). As for the bed, it's just amazing how comfortable a hotel bed can be!!! We had a great and comfortable night-sleep. Breakfast: The breakfast is being served in a nice room next to the lobby. You'll get fresh eggs every morning (scrambled eggs, boiled eggs, fried eggs etc. as you wish) such as coffee, tea, cereals, yoghurt, fruits, water, fresh juices, cheese and cold meat. It's not a luxury breakfast buffet with caviar and salmon but it's perfect. You don't need more on a morning when you afterwards want to discover the town. The quality of the food is very good and fresh! Nothing to add on this. We both always looked forward to the breakfast. Amenities: On a regularly basis there are magazines being delivered to your room such as Cosmopolitan, Elle, The Economist, London Out etc. You can also keep them and read them when you're on your way back home on the airplane. You've got free internet within the whole hotel. You'll get provided with a code for the WLAN and can use the internet as long as you'd like to for the whole length of your stay. Everything in the room is free. There is no minibar in the room but you've got a fridge and you can buy drinks yourself and put it in there. There are water bottles in the room and the equipment to make yourself a tea or a coffee, such as fruits and cookies. All of it is free. When you feel very thirsty the kind hotel employees will provide you with more of it. Location: The hotel is very well located in the area Marleybone. If you come from the airport, the best way to get there is taking the Heathrow express to Paddington and from there a taxi will take you to the hotel within less than 10 minutes. If you arrive at Gatwick, you'll take the Gatwick express until Victoria station and from there you can take a taxi to the hotel which will take you around 15 minutes (with traffic) to the hotel. The hotel is within walking distance to the Paddington station (around 15 to 20 minutes) and from the Baker Street tube station (5 minutes) and from the Marelybone tube station. You can also walk to the Oxford street within 10 minutes. Although the hotel is very central it's situated in a residential area aside a very nice little park. At night it's not at all loud. Outstanding service: The reason, next to the design of the hotel, the rooms and the location, is the outstanding service of the friendly people working at Montague Place. We've never stayed at a Hotel which such a friendly service so far (we've stayed at very expensive hotels where the service was really poor...)!!! It's just amazing!!! The persons working there treat you like friends and are very obliging, friendly, funny, polite and have all the great characteristics you could think of. Some examples: I ordered a clothing item from at home in Switzerland which could only be sent to the UK therefore I asked them whether I could let it send to the hotel and if they then could take care of this item upon my arrival. They told me it would be no problem at all and therefore kept it during 3 weeks in their hotels and when I arrived they just handed it over to me without me even asking for it. Coming from Barbados we arrived very early at the Montagu Place Hotel (around 7.45 in the morning). We were kindly offered some tea and coffee and stayed for a while in the lobby. Went to the bathroom to refresh ourselves a bit after the journey. At 9 o'clock in the morning (!!!) - we were just about to leave for breakfast and wanted to leave the baggage at the reception - we were told the room has now been cleaned already so that we could already move in. We were really positively surprised that someone cleaned it so quickly and we could go to our room already at 9 o'clock in the morning. On our last night I did the web-checkin and as we didn't have printer with us I e-mailed our e-tickets to the reception asking wether they could print it out and hold it ready upon our departure the other morning. After 2 minutes I had an e-mail in my inbox telling me, that the tickets were print out and being brought to my room immediately. What a great service. Every time you passed the reception the staff was smiling at you (a warm smile and no fake smile) and the chatted with you. Very nice. You always felt like coming home and not like coming to an anonymous place. On our last time when we needed a taxi someone even went outside and to the street and called us a taxi. Very kind. Price-value: The price you pay for the Montagu Place Hotel is not cheap but it's 100% worth it's money!!! Quality never is free of charge ;-)!!! But we don't wanna say that it's expensive. It's just perfect price-value. But don't expect it to be cheap. But I guess by reading the above review you'll notice as well the the boutique hotel is a jewel in the big city of London!!! To sum up, we are very very happy that we found that hotel in July last year. We found the perfect location to stay at and we'll never ever look for something else when we come to London. It's of none importance wether you're old or young, a couple or two friends, business travelers or on a private journey --> Montague Place Hotel will please all of you, but only if you look for something special, with overwhelming staff etc. Thank again to the staff of Montagu Place Hotel for our amazing London experience we could live thanks to you!!!

Bedroom and bathroom were spotlessly clean and freshly styled. Nice touches: complimentary bottled water, cafetiere coffee and choice of teas in the bedroom, plus Molton Brown toiletries in the bathroom. Great to have a proper hairdryer! I moved rooms the 2nd night of my stay, as I was unexpectedly joined by an elderly relative, and the only room left was on the 4th (top) floor - 65 steps up. Yes, I actually counted them! Note that because the hotel is in a listed building, there is no lift so if you have problems climbing stairs, ask for a room on a lower floor. My \"swanky\" room on the 2nd night was gorgeous! Very spacious, with a beautiful bathroom and deluxe range of Molton Brown toiletries. I only wish I'd had more time to enjoy the room. Location is good: 10 minutes walk (maximum) from Oxford Street, but in a relatively quiet area within walking distance also of Marylebone High Street. I did have to explain to three taxi drivers exactly where the hotel was located as they hadn't heard of it, so I recommend you print out the map that comes with the email confirmation from the hotel, or, tell them to drive north out of Portman Square onto Gloucester Place and take 2nd left turn at traffic lights onto Montagu Place.

The bath was a little small, but this didn't matter as the shower was great. What we loved were the special little extra touches, like Molton Brown toiletries in the bathrooms - a real treat. We enjoyed a fantastic meal from room service - the hotel has partnered up with a local Thai restaurant to offer hot food, and this was just delicious. And again, the service was absolutely excellent - meal brought to our room within 20 minutes of ordering. Oxford Street and all of its shops are just a 10 minute walk round the corner and straight down the road.

Maybe my expectations were a little out of line because for the price, this really is a great hotel in comparison to a lot of other hotels in London. I just want to give an honest review, so you can know what to expect. Room: We stayed in room 21- a \"Comfy\" room (the smallest of the 3 types) with a double bed and shower. It is to my knowledge that not all rooms come with a shower..some come with only a bathtub (so make sure you request). Modern furnishings were nice, but the room was very cramped with a huge, bulky desk smashed up next to the bed. Carpet was looking a little worn and I would have much prefered hard wood flooring for a more modern feel. Floor was very uneven that I thought maybe I had too much to drink. LOL. But some people might consider that charming! The room is starting to look worn and could probably use a coat of fresh paint (luggage marks on the wall). I noticed some grime in the crevices of the bathroom floor near the shower, which was a little disappointing. We did enjoy the luxury toiletries. The TV was a small, flat screen with few channels. We did appreciate that it was a very quiet room, and we heard no noise from adjacent rooms or from the street. But, we slept poorly because the bed was small and hard. I never get back aches from sleeping, but I did for the 2 nights we were here. If we stay here again, I would upgrade to a bigger room, and hopefully it comes with a bigger bed! Service: We were welcomed promptly and our room was ready before the standard check in time, which was very nice. The staff was polite and friendly but not intrusive. If you are curious about something, ask them and they will be more than willing to help. We got a great restaurant recommendation (Hunter 486 at the Arch Hotel). We chose not to eat breakfast at the hotel and that was just fine, due to all of the options just a short walk away. Amenities: Free Wi-Fi was great! We wish they would have had a gym, but apparently they give out gym passes to a place which is within walking distance.

I was stuck in London for a week when the Icelandic volcano decided to act up, and the Montagu - and it's truly wonderful staff - saved me. The hotel and its staff are exceptional (I travel internationally for business a large percentage of my time, and this place stands out!). I recommend it without reservation. The hotel booked by the people I met with tripled the room rates because (as far as I can tell) they could get away with it, and I decided I'd rather sleep in the train station than get gouged. Luckily, I googled first and the Montagu came up, and when I called them to ask about availability the gentleman who answered was amazingly helpful - I moved hotels that afternoon. I had several enjoyable conversations with the staff at the little bar (of which the main desk is a part), and everyone did all they could to make my extra time in London effective. On top of the little french press and coffee in my room (standard, and a huge relief after the more common packets of instant coffee) and the included wireless internet, they did my laundry so that I could get through my unexpected additional week, they pointed me to good local coffee houses and lunch spots, and generally went out of their ways to make sure that I was comfortable and felt well-looked after (and I did). Everyone else in my working group who was also stranded was very jealous (yes, I gloated). The rooms (I was in a neat attic room) are pleasant, the beds very comfortable, and everything was mostly well-kempt (they were apparently touching up the hallways the next week) and clean (the only 5 I've ever given for cleanliness was a German hotel that glistened). The hotel is off the Bakerloo stop, not too far, and the walk to Imperial through the park is pleasant in good weather. The place can be a bit pricy if you're on a tight budget, or even on an expense account. I was lucky and got a good deal, and then -- when they found out about my first hotel's behavior -- they made it even better. That personal recognition of client stresses is what makes a hotel (or any service) stand out, and Montagu, under Demitrios' excellent captainship, does so in spades.

I did a pretty exhaustive round of research on Central London hotels and this one seemed to have it all: great reviews, reasonable prices at the 4 star level, boutique-style/quaint and served breakfast. So I booked it, and was very glad I did! Note: if you prefer larger, chain hotels, this isn't for you. It's only 16 rooms, set in a townhouse and there are no workout facilities, as well as their room service is a local thai restaurant (not from their own kitchen). They do serve breakfast and have tea service through the day though, as well as laundry service. My main purpose of the trip was business, but I also stayed two weekends to site see, with my boyfriend joining me halfway through. It was important to me to not be in a cramped space, like so many European hotel rooms can be. Upon booking, I saw that only their smallest \"Comfy\" room was available, so I put a note asking to be placed in a larger room if one became available. About a week later, the manager, Dimitrios, called me personally stating that it I could be be moved into their Swanky deluxe room for only \u00a330 more per night. Sold!! I also pre-bought breakfast daily for \u00a310/day as apposed to \u00a314 you would pay at the hotel. My arrival was easy as I had pre-arranged a car service from Heathrow through the hotel.

Huge bed and a divine bathroom, complete with a big tub. I knew I'd be comfortable here for 10 days. Overall the service of the hotel is excellent: every single person that works there is helpful and kind. They remember who you are and don't try to slip in hidden charges on the bill. The location is fantastic, a couple blocks from the Baker Street Tube station, or Oxford Street, but in a quiet residential area. The breakfast is an assortment of rolls, mini cheeses, meats, yogurt, juice, and cereal--complete with eggs made to order and fresh coffee or tea.

After arriving on a very early morning flight the hotel staff kindly did their best to let me check in as soon as possible. They took and stored my luggage, gave me excellent walking directions to the British Museum, and told me the room would be ready at noon. With three hours to kill I walked to the Museum, had a snack at coffee shop, and true to their word my room was ready at noon. The staff had already taken my bags to the room -- nice touch of personal service. The two staff members I meet during my stay were friendly, professional, and eager to help with any request or question that came up. I didn't feel like just another guest, they made me feel like their only guest. The hotel property itself is in a good location in the Marylebone neighborhood, easy walking distance to Oxford Street (Selfridges, John Lewis, and tons of shopping options), Hyde Park (Speaker's Corner), Park Lane, Regent's Park, Madame Tussard's, and the Baker Street Tube station. The rooms are well appointed and comfortable. I had a double on the second floor (up one flight of stairs). The room was on the back side of the hotel so traffic noise wasn't an issue. The bed was heavenly, firm and supportive, plenty of pillows, and a nice soft duvet to keep me warm. The bathroom was spacious, shower stall big enough for two, and lovely Molton Brown toiletries. I liked having the in room coffee/tea service, free bottled water, and delicious gingerbread cookies -- perfect bedtime snack. There is also free Wi-Fi throughout the property. Excellent service, comfortable rooms, and reasonable rates make the Montagu Place good value for money. Just a tip -- If you're arriving in London via Heathrow the Paddington express train will have you in the city in about twenty minutes.

Our 'Swanky' room however was more spacious with 2 lots of french doors and 2 small balconies. The bathroom was lovely - light and spacious with french doors and a balcony too. The rooms were clean although a little more attention could have been paid to the doors and windows which were quite dirty and marked. The reception staff were helpful and pleasant . Noise from the road at night was minimal. The hotel itself is in a good position. We booked it because our daughters wanted to go to Madame Tussauds and wanted to be within walking distance. We also walked to Oxford Street which was not too far. The only thing that I have to say that probably let it down slightly was the breakfast. It was basic and the member of staff not so friendly. We waited ages for coffee and scrambled eggs. No one came round to see if everything was ok or if we would have liked anything else. Overall slightly poor. All in all we liked this hotel.

It is just the small things that are lacking that would give it the \"luxury\" or boutique feel and look again. i stayed in a \"fancy\" room, as it was described and I have to say it was a little smaller than I expected, but for people that stay in London hotels frequently, that's to be expected !!!! The bed was very comfortable and when the hotel was new, I'm sure that the finishing touches were there, but now the towels are not the quality you expect, the TV is dated with very few channels and bad reception, a hotel really should provide cable TV !!...its just missing that final quality feel.

It turned out great. Once again reminding me why I love this site! The hotel is well situated in the Baker Street area and really close to Madame Tussuad's. With easy access to the Bakerloo, Jubilee, H&City and Circle lines, getting around from here is easy. We were in room 33, on the top floor so it was really quiet. There are no lifts in the hotel so the stairs were a bit challenging after a long day's walking but really not a major hindrance. The (Comfy) room was spacious and the bathroom was small but clean, and recently renovated. We DID get the complimentary water, and made use of the kettle to make tea and coffee. The only negative thing we found was that the bed was a bit small for us. A standard sized 140, but both being used to a 160 we found it difficult to get a good night's sleep. If you are like us, and like your space when you sleep, call ahead when booking and ask if you can get a room with a larger bed - It might mean you will have to pay more for a Swanky room though. I did mention this to the staff in the morning and they were very understanding and had they not been booked up, they would have upgraded us to a larger bed! We chose not to have breakfast at the hotel as we thought it was a bit expensive (\u00a313, or \u00a310 if you book in advance when booking the room) and despite waking up to the smell of freshly baked croissants (yes, all the way up to the top floor) we preferred getting a coffee and a muffin at the nearby Costa, Pret, or Starbucks. If you want a nice hearty cooked English breakfast, Mina's down the road towards the station serves up a good plate of food for only \u00a35. Also in the area is the Canteen, which is also worth a visit. They have really good opening hours and serves traditional English grub morning, noon and night. Worth mentioning too, for the shoppers, is that a couple of buses will take you from Oxford Street ( just near Selfridge's) right up to the corner of Glouster Road and Montagu Place which is a live saver after a long day.

I do think that when you have full occupancy, that you appear to need more than one person at the reception desk. Having young ladies carry very heavy suitcases up several flights of stairs, while they have to leave the front desk, doesn't make for an efficient coverage of calls, reception, etc. While your breakfast is quite good, a bit of variety, rather than the exact same offerings each day would be welcome.

I scoured the Internet looking for a London hotel that would be a good value, even though most of our stay was to be reimbursed by my office. We were not disappointed. Our room (#32) was delightful, and quite large by London standards. We had king bed and a bath with tub and shower. Molton Brown toiletries were refreshed every day. The best part of this hotel was the staff. We made it a habit at the end of each day to have a glass of wine in the bar, and so we met nearly all of the young ladies (and a few men) who handled reception. All were great fun, but we became especially fond of Christiane, who steered us to terrific restaurants and offered other sage advice. Despite the fact the hotel has had a few negative reviews recently, my husband and I recommend it without reservation (no pun intended!).

First off, it was a rocky start. They got our room wrong and could not find our reservation at first. It was our anniversay trip so you can imagine this set us both off and we were very concerned, the staff did everything to be accomodating and although we had to stay in a smaller room at first, we were promptly upgraded to the largest size room at teh hotel. From here on out were were nothing BUT pleased with our stay and they could not have been more sorry with the mis communication. They greeted us by name for the remainder of the week and we just absolutly feel in love with this hotel and would stay here at any time. WE loved the modern boutique feel at a very affordable price. We HATE stuffy places that have floral curtains and bedspreads and will only stay in modern, clean bedroooms with modeern ammenities. We did not mind that it was very small and short staffed as we are not ones to get a ton of room service. It made us get out and see london, however, we loved staying in when we felt like it. It was a brisk walk to anything you needed and to areas like Oxford Circus, as well as a quick walk to the tube. We stayed in the swanky for most of the stay. We were initially placed in a fancy or comfy, I cant remeber whichone it was but it was very nice, just too small for us. FYI there is no elevators and at least 4 or 5 qucik flights and very narrow stairs so it is a bit hard to get your luggage up and down, however, they are more than happy to do it for you. I only mention this as it would not be an ideal place for someone with children or perhaps and elderly couple. We are young and quite frankly could use the extra exercise after all the food we ate in LONDON! Bottom Line, We would stay here anytime. It is totally cute, very convienient, quiet, modern affordable, and everything you woudl need in a great hotel.", "Date": "December 20, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney, Australia", "Title": "\u201cTerrible Service\u201d", "Author": "Reb_Jim", "ReviewID": "UR10789017", "Content": "I booked this hotel 4 motnhs in advance paying full rate. During a 10 week trip around Europe this was a bit of a splurge,but I decided after reading the reviews it would be worth it. I booked on line, and rang about 2 weeks out to confirm the booking and advise our arrival time. I also rang on the day when our train was delayed. At no time when I CONTACTED THEM did hey mention that they did not actually have a room for us!! Mind you, they also had my mobile number to contact me and let me know. When we arrived, there were 2 girls chatting at reception, one obviously a staff member who had knocked off and was sitting on the guest side of the desk having a chat. When I finally got noticed, the girl told me that there had been 'a booking error' on their behalf and they did not have a room for us! She did not apologise at all, or explain very well that they had arranged us another room at another hotel. Her English was not very good and her communication skills terrible. I asked for the manager but he was not there. I was pretty angry, but tried to stay calm - she proceded to show me a map of a similar hotel near by, but it was her only copy and did not want to give it to me. Expected us to make our own way to this other hotel??!! We demanded a lfit and they finally arranged a limo - who was given the wrong address and took us to the wrong place! When we left the Montagu (good riddance) I asked the girl to have the manger contact me to discuss what had happened - of course, he never did.

We really wanted to find somewhere special with that wow factor so we paid the full rack rate and went for the most expensive (\"Swanky\") rooms. When we arrived I was expecting a warm and professional reception. In fact the girl on reception seemed a bit disorganised and almost surprised to see us. There were 4 of us but the receptionist had to be prompted twice to give us the two rooms we had booked. We were given our key cards and told where to find the rooms. Am I wrong to think that if I am paying over \u00a3200 for each room (excluding breakfast) that someone should show us to our rooms? Anyway, we had asked for the rooms to be made up as twins. They both were but in one of the rooms they had used a king sized throw on the beds which seemed bit odd. The rest of the bedding was singles so we didn't bother to complain. The rooms are really nice, but for the price we were paying I expected to have a bit more space. I appreciate that it's a listed building (I live in a listed building myself) but even so, there was about an inch between the beds which is not quite what I had expected. The bathrooms were lovely and big and we had lovely big windows. One of the rooms had really lovely, soft new bathrobes of a sort of chenille fabric. The other room had scratchy older feeling towelling robes, which was a bit of a disappointment. The rooms were supposed to have fresh fruit in on arrival. One room had a pack of Tesco fruit salad in the otherwise empty fridge, the other room had nothing (when we got back in the evening I asked for some to be brough up and it was - a pretty good selection too). Also for tea and coffee there were only those little plastic tubs of UHT milk which are always pretty dreadful. Seeing as there is a fridge in the room would it be too much to expect fresh milk? Other, cheaper hotels manage it and Montagu Place only has a handful of rooms... Also no biscuits or snacks on the tea tray was a bit poor. The beds were lovely and comfortable - a wonderful nights sleep (once we'd found out how to turn the heating down and left the aircon on for a bit). Next morning, checking with my mum in the other room I found out that one of the taps had fallen off (!) and that the towell rail had come loose in my mum's hand. We left a note so hopefully these problems would have been fixed. Check out was easy if a little drawn out (printer problems). I was disappointed not to be asked how my stay was.

Most importantly, bed linens and room carpet were both spotless. So too the bathroom and towels. Tremendous shower with good temperature control and pressure. Nice flat screen TV with good selection of channels; DVDs available from the front desk but didn't use. Didn't make much use of staff but what interaction I did have was pleasant. Key to the MPH is its location. Short walks to each of Baker Street tube, Oxford Street shopping, Central Line tube stations and Marylebone High Street. Ten minute cab from Paddington Station. Great restaurants and pubs on all sides. A perfect location from which to set out for the day and to return at the end.

We had a top floor swanky room and the view of the classic London chimneys, the sounds of the neighborhood, the skylight in the wonderful bathroom - everything was so nice. Cool tv! The breakfast was wonderful and now at home I'm doing the closest copy to it - but I'll miss one front desk lady in particular. My husband and I are still talking about her. She and everyone else was just decent and kind to \"come home to\" no matter what time of day or night. These smaller boutique hotels need to be real and human and this one was also very sweet. There are plenty of shops along Baker St nearby for just about everything, such as a post office, Starbuck's (if you must), Tesco for snacks and things, etc., etc. Walk a few blocks to Marylebone High Street and be pleasantly surprised. Our departure breakfast on a Sunday was at 79 Marylebone High St, Coco Momo (formerly Dusk) and it was also lovely. The entire area is clean. Be sure to take a real London taxi while you visit.

Check-in is 3.00pm, but we were a little early and after a quick drink in the hotel bar, Room no.12 was ready for us (still before the allocated time) Facing the street, with it's own balcony, our room was spotlessly clean with everything you could need for a stay in the capital and the soft furnishings and bedding/towels were great quality. The bathroom suite looked almost brand new and I liked the his and hers basins, underfloor heating, Molton Brown accessories and power shower. I didn't like the bathroom scales....The only thing I wasn't mad about was the bed - as it was quite hard - BUT maybe I'm not the best person to judge this. This certainly wouldn't discourage me from staying here again. It would be unfair not to make mention of the staff at the Montagu Place. We met three different members whilst there, and I can only say kind things - nothing was too much trouble for any of them, from the early check in, to the cappuccino and beer at Midnight, to paying the \u00a350.00 parking ticket that I picked up outside the hotel in a residents parking bay!
