Luckily I was there only for 2 nights, as I don't think I would have survived a third. To be fair, we did not stay in the normal part of \"Hotel Brian\" but a sort of annex, a few doors down. In this part of the hotel there is no reception and no one there to help if you happen to need it. Nevermind the stairs, as there's not much you can do about the extraordinarily steep tiny stairs in Amsterdam, but the rooms were shockingly basic. I know it's a hostel. But that doesn't mean that it has to be foul. We paid a whopping 100 euro for a 4 bed room (4 friends traveling) and it was disgusting. The light in the ONLY bathroom in the building (that served I think at least 4 other rooms) was out. Which meant having to go to the toilet with the door open! I also think the other guests in the hostel were part of the terrible stay - all young, drunk males, who not only kept us up all night with their loud singing and hollering, but apparently also could not tell the difference between the toilet bowl and the floor. So you can imagine what the bathroom with no light looked like the next morning. I might add that this bathroom was also the only one with a shower. I did not shower, or go to the toilet in the hostel the entire weekend I was there. Surprisingly, this was not cleaned up (nor was the light fixed) while we were there. We also had been told breakfast was served until 10:30am, so seeing as we had gotten no sleep thanks to the other guests, we decided to sleep in and go for breakfast at 10am. But at 10am breakfast was closed and we couldn't get any since the girl wanted to go home. This was just the first night staying here. I can't say the second one was any better. Stay away from this place. It's not worth it whatsoever.

If you had a suitcase you wouldn't be able to get up the stairs. Once on the top floor (3rd or 4th floor) we entered our Double Room with Shared Bathroom facilties. We were due to pay $87AUD per night for this room. The lock on the door was faulty. The room was unbelievably small, smelly and not particularly clean. The 'Double Bed' was more like a single cot on the floor. And the room had no furniture. I have no doubt in my mind there would have been bed bugs. The roof was just a skylight that was covered in dirt and the window was small & dirty with bars across. To make matters worse, the toilet was filthy and the shower/bathroom was OUT OF ORDER! That was the last straw for us so we went downstairs, paid for the first night to be fair and left to find other accommodation.

I stayed at this same hotel almost 20 years ago and went back again recently - a lot can change in 20 years. I'll start off with a plus: It's very conveniently located within walking distance to Centraal Station. And now for the rest: We were scolded a bit by the woman at reception for being late - it certainly wasn't our fault that our flight was four hours late departing from the U.S. and I certainly wasn't going to call them from the U.S. to tell them we would be arriving late. She then proceeded to try to charge us 10 euro more per night than what we'd been quoted via email. Luckily, I had a copy of the email with me and once she saw that I had been quoted the price and had back and forth emails with her boss, her attitude changed quickly for the better. However, I think we were given the worst double room possible for arriving late - it was about the size of a closet directly across from the toilet. The \"double\" bed is not much bigger than a twin, but overall, it was clean enough. The bath and shower were also clean enough and there were no fleas/bedbugs. The Hotel Brian is not the kind of place you stay in if you expect to sleep (rather thin walls with people having lots of fun in their rooms), but most of the people working there are friendly, laid back and it's a bit of a family atmosphere at breakfast. They did not ask us to do our own dishes like another reviewer wrote. We could have had eggs, but chose to have toast with peanut butter and coffee that you can serve yourself.

We got there and our room was disgusting. Walls had gross stains up them (I don't even want to think about it). It had a nasty smell and the sheets on every bed had stains on them. Again don't ask, there was sick, one sheet looked like a bike had been ridden up the middle of it and one had suspicious white stains lovely. After much complaining they did change them for us but what they changed them with wasn't much better. if you showered early then the showers were clean but they got dirty very quickly and it was easy to get stuck in them. Breakfast was ok but started about an hour later than advertised so if you want an early start you have to skip it. location by the canal not too bad but has red light ladies either side and doesn't make you feel particularly safe.

It was very easy to find, in a good location close to the Dam Square but not actually in the red light district, so pretty quiet. I paid \u00e2\u201a\u00ac145 for the room for 3 nights which I felt was good value. All we needed on arrival was \u00e2\u201a\u00ac20 for a key deposit, we paid in full the next day. If you are used to self-catering and 1* accommodation, you will be happy with this place. It is very basic, but comfortable. I had booked a double room through hostelbookers but they only had a twin with bunk beds on the day. I was not happy about this, but the bottom bed was ok for 2 people for a few nights. The room also had a sink, chair, wall-mounted shelf/table, open wardrobe and a safe which didn't work. It was small and functional, but clean and didn't smell. Smoking is allowed in rooms. The 2 friends we were with had not booked, but as we arrived fairly late at night the staff let them have the available quad room (2 singles and 2 bunks) for the same price. We ended up using this as a kind of living room through the day. My friends said their single beds were too short. I personally didn't feel that the staff were overly friendly, but they weren't unfriendly either and we had no problems with them. We did often heard them arguing with each other and with other guests, though. The building was nice and warm and the shared shower (there is one on each floor), though a little musty smelling, was clean and the water was hot and powerful. Towels and bedlinen are provided, but we had to ask for the towels. The walls are very thin and you can hear every word in the next room. The stairs are very steep and narrow, but there is a quad room on the ground floor which is easily accessible. The reception area has about 6 tables of four where you can sit and relax, though the chairs are the typical coffee-shop chairs, hard and uncomfortable. Smoking is allowed and there is a computer with free internet access and a TV. Breakfast is served here from 8-9.30am, I didn't have any, but it seemed to consist of mainly eggs and bread. There is a little kitchen where you can make tea and coffee and cook food if you want to. Round the back of the hotel are some prostitute's windows, but it is about a 5-10 minute walk to the proper red light district. Within a 5 minute walk from the hotel there are lots of coffee-shops, restaurants, Central Station and tram stops. I would recommend this place for travellers on a budget, backpackers, groups of friends and younger couples. I would not recommend it for people with children, people with mobility problems or people who like luxurious hotels that they can spend all day in.", "Date": "February 26, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Leeds, England", "Title": "\u201cHotel Brian - Fantastic!\u201d", "Author": "emleh", "ReviewID": "UR6022684", "Content": "We booked Hotel Brian expecting the worst.

We spent a week at the hotel and were made to feel like part of the family. Each morning, you were cooked eggs and toast by a very enthusiastic guy called Allen (who can talk the leg off a wooden chair- DON\"T GET HIM STARTED ON ANY DEEP CONVERSATIONS!! ha ha) One of the reception guys called Brent made our stay there great. He is the most friendly guy in the world and would do anything for anyone. He took us under his wing and showed us the sights of Amsterdam and told us all the do's and dont's. It is a great place to meet other travellers as there is a common room which everyone is welcome to use. We spent a lot of time there and made some good friends. The hotel has free internet that you can use any time, free tea and coffee and free use of the kitchen. The common room also has fox tv, but don't watch when Allen is on shift cause he watches the discovery channel and will start talking about the evolution and of man and wont stop even if you walk away. (nice guy though) There is no curfew and it is very secure. It is located right in the heart of Amsterdam - 5 minute walk to the red light district and main shopping mall.
