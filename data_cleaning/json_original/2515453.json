We chose this hotel because the one we normally stay in during our trips to Legoland was booked. We were due to arrive late Tuesday night. We had booked a non-smoking, 1 king bed suite. Knowing we would arrive late, I called Tuesday morning to advise the hotel that we would be checking in close to midnight and that I would love to have a crib waiting for us in our room since we would have a 2 year old ready for bed by the time we arrived. The lady at reception said she would send one right up and noted our late arrival. As planned we arrived around 1am. I went to the front desk to check in and the gentleman took an unusually long time to check us into a room. When I asked him if there was a crib in the room he said no but that he would send one up. We carried all our sleepy kids up to the 12th floor and walked into a very smoky room, my kids instantly noticed and complained of the smell. I called the front desk and told them that we had reserved a non-smoking room. He told me that they had over-booked and that I had the only room left in the entire hotel. I proceeded to tell him that its not my problem that they overbooked and that I reserved and was paying for a non-smoking room, how can they just give my room away? He said that they had oxidized the room extra to try to get rid of the smell for me...whatever that means it didn't work. He had no further explanation other than to apologize and offered me to speak to the manger at 7am. Still waiting for the crib to arrive, the one that was promised to have already been in our room, we put the kids to bed. The room smelled like an old musty smoky casino, I couldn't sleep and ended up hanging out in the lobby's fresh air until about 330am. I went back to the room fell asleep for 2 hours, showered and went to the lobby again to hang out until breakfast was served at 6am. At 7am I spoke to the assistant manager that was very surprised by what had happened. He apologized and told us we would not be charged for the room that night. He told us he would move all of our belongings as soon as a new room was cleaned later that morning. I left all of our belongings in the front room and when we got back from Legoland everything (except for the crib, which I had to request for again) was in a new smoke free room. The rest of our stay was great, but that first night was awful. The kids tossed and turned all night and barely slept, my husband and I barely slept after a six hour drive to San Diego. As a family with a toddler and two older kids we regularly stay at suite type hotels, which are considerably more expensive but for the added convenience of having 2 rooms it is worth it, so to have this happen to us was really a shocker especially from an Embassy Suites.

Overall, it is a good hotel, but it has some significant cons in my view. It has a pretty good location, close to freeway and La Jolla Village square shopping center. It is in atrim style architecture. The room is spacious and clean including a small frig and microwave. The bathroom is clean. We were on the 12th floor and were nicely surprised we did not hear much noise from outside the room given the style it is. Breakfast time was pretty crowded, but it seems good. Now the cons: Internet is about $10/day in the room. There is no free wifi in the lobby which many hotels do have it free in the lobby. The parking is about the worst I have seen. It has a few parking spaces to one side of the hotel, and a 3 storey parking structure. The parking slot for each car is very narrow, and the drive through path is narrow too. When a car goes out and while a car comes in, one of them has to back out in order for the other to go through. And you'd have to make a u-turn to drive out as the structure does not have a drive out path from the top parking storey. It is difficult if a car parked there for you to make a u-turn. And there are big block columns as well as cars parked right there at the turns so you are always afraid to hit either the block or the car. When I complained about the parking, the front desk gave me a designated parking space by the side of the hotel which is not that big either. So we end up still using the structure. They need to redesign and build a new parking structure. Another minor point is if someone is afraid of height, do not take a room on high floors due to the atrim open style architecture. It takes some getting used to. And there were a lot of kids running around in the hotel perhaps due to the weekend when we stayed. The pool was crowded with kids. So overall, the hotel room itself is good but amenities are not up to par. Its parking brought down its scores for me. If you don't have to worry about parking, then it is not a bad choice. For me, this hotel stays on the bottom of my list for right now.", "Date": "March 24, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Santa Cruz", "Title": "\u201cPleasant stay\u201d", "Author": "Matt M", "ReviewID": "UR125529943", "Content": "This is a fairly typical Embassy Suites, and while it has gone through some renovations, it is showing its age.

It's an atrium-style layout with 11 floors. I had a 1 bedroom suite (true suite, not divider walled) that was spacious and well appointed. The hotel was completed renovated 5 years ago and further fitted with flat screen TVs a year ago. In addition to the usual coffee maker there is also a small fridge and microwave. Internet is about $10 and self-parking is $20. Everyone was friendly--I had to go to the nearby Hyatt for dinner and the bellman was happy to drive me over in the van. The fitness room is a little small for the size of the hotel, just three treadmills, a couple of elliptical trainers, and that's about it. It wasn't too busy when I was in there at 8 am but it wouldn't take much to fill it up. The indoor pool looked nice but too small for laps. There is a hot tub outside. The free breakfast buffet has a good selection of hot and cold items. It ends at 9 am so I stopped by after my workout, loaded some things onto a tray and ate in my room later, which worked out well. It did seem to get a little crowded and there were several people waiting in line for the omelet station. The Embassy Suites is not as nice as the Hyatt 5 minutes down the road, and you can't beat the Hyatt's beautiful lap pool and nextdoor enormous health club which Hyatt guests can use (for $13 I think).

After staying at nearby the Hilton Garden Inn (Del Mar) and DoubleTree (Del Mar), the Embassy ranks at the bottom of my list of Hilton choices when I travel to this area. It is not a terrible hotel, by any means; it just isn't my favorite among the various Hilton brand options in the area. For a family get-away on a weekend it may be the best option in the area, with the large family room and spacious accommodations. During my stay, however, I had the impression that the hotel seems a bit \"tired\" and stale (as are many Embassy Suites around the country), and the general feel of the hotel left me wanting more. That being said, all my interactions with the staff were very pleasant and the check in was very speedy and friendly. The Good: The location is very convenient, right off the 805 freeway and across from a large shopping mall with lots of options for food and beverage. A quick 15 minute drive over the hill takes you to the beach at La Jolla and the quaint and upscale shops and restaurants there. The rooms are very spacious and comfortable with a typical Embassy Suites layout of sitting room with sofa/desk in the front room and a bedroom in the back. The views from the taller floors are nice (for this area, which is very commercial). The bathroom amenities are nice (they even included a razor, shaving cream, toothbrush, toothpaste, and a mending kit). The linens and towels are very nice quality, however the pillows are synthetic and very spongy - if you are used to down pillows, you may wake up with a neck-ache like I did every morning. Staff is very friendly and helpful The Not-so-Good: This hotel is one of the more expensive Hilton options nearby for the regular room rates. Add $20 a day for parking and it becomes significantly more expensive, without delivering additional meaningful value. The parking garage fills up quickly and is so narrow you have to back up if someone comes the other way while trying to exit, which is incredibly frustrating when you are just trying to get to the office in the morning. The Free Breakfast: Standing in line for breakfast. Really? Come on! I am fortunate to get free breakfast at *any* Hilton (as HHonors Gold or Diamond) so the \"free\" breakfast at the Embassy was not my reason for choosing the hotel. However, if it had been, the deal-killer for me is that there is no quick buffet for hot items like pancakes, french toast, waffles, etc. Instead you have to queue up behind everyone in a long serpentine line to order one person at a time. The problem is so bad, they even post a \"warning\" about it in the rooms!) You must stand in line for anything besides cold cereal, muffins, or toast. After standing in line 15 minutes my first day for two pancakes, I opted to go across the street to Corner Bakery for my breakfast the remaining days of my stay. As to the rest of the food options at the \"breakfast buffet\", they are less numerous and of lower quality than the aforementioned HGI and Doubltree, both of which offer very nice (and fast) breakfasts by comparison. For example, the coffee at the Embassy is made from coffee-flavored syrup and hot water that is mixed as you dispense it - like the stuff in a college dorm or cruise ship - it is not even brewed. (That was a big turn-off to me) I found the air in my room to be stale smelling; almost as though someone had smoked in the room some time before and the smell never quite cleared (there isn't a way to crack a window for fresh air). Also, I happened to check in on an unusually cold and rainy evening and I turned on the heater in the room (which inexplicably had been turned completely off). I quickly realized why it had been disabled by a previous occupant - the fan was noisy and the air that issued from the vents smelled awful - dusty and dirty and reminiscent of the exhaust from an old vacuum cleaner that needs to have its bag changed. In fairness, heaters probably aren't used much in San Diego, but it was still off-putting. Bottom line, if you are traveling on business and don't mind driving an extra 10 minutes, I would personally recommend the nearby Hilton Garden Inn or Doubletree hotels - you'll save money on the room rate and get free parking, plus you will have a newer room and a far superior breakfast in the morning, with equally friendly and helpful staff.", "Date": "February 29, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fort Worth, TX", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel for business\u201d", "Author": "mdr9", "ReviewID": "UR125076758", "Content": "I have stayed here numerous times while on business trips to our Home office in San Diego.

Great stay! We would have liked connecting rooms, but we've traveled enough together that we know that chance is hit and miss. We always try to make the effort to stay at the Embassy Suites because of the free breakfast and happy hour, and this was by far the best one we've stayed at. It is primarily a business hotel, which was nice for us because it meant our kids were competing with a million other kids for the pool in the evening! Thursday night was the best, as there was low business traffic. By Saturday night the place was PACKED, so we retired early as to not compete with the pool crowds. The breakfast lines can get quite long, but if you plan your morning and take the advice of the breakfast traffic card they put in your room, you will have no problems. (Wake up earlier... I'd rather lose 30 minutes of sleep then waste 30 minutes in the omelet line...). The breakfast is hot and plentiful, and basic buffet flavor as far as that goes. We gorged ourselves so as to hold off lunch longer throughout the day, and it is easy to do so with the large selection they have. The happy hour was great each night. Not as much of a food \"spread\" as we've have seen in other Embassy Suites, but again, as this is more of a business hotel, they aren't putting out the treats a family on vacation usually wants.

The USP of embassy suites is the cooked to order breakfast, and frankly it was a bit of a disappointment with limited selection...

Our room was well appointed with a microwave, an empty mini fridge, a wet bar, a full-sized sofa pullout in the sitting area, and a kig sized bed in the bedroom + GOOD LOCATION ~ Easy access to major freeways, 10 mins. drive to SD beaches, a mid to high-end malls just opposite the hotel, lots of restaurants nearby + PROFESSIONAL AND FRIENDLY STAFF ~ There were many families with kids (MANY!) at the hotel during our stay. The lobby was quite chaotic, esp. during breakfast and happy hour reception. However, the staff were well trained and were able to keep the place together. Minses: - PARKING CHALLENGES ~ The hotel garage is really TIGHT. We drove a RX350, and had difficult times getting in and out of the garage. If you had to use the garage, I suggest parking your car on the first level. On the upper floors, inflow and outflow traffic SHARE ONE SINGLE LANE. We had to park our car on the street on the 1st night b'cos the garage was full, due to a function at the hotel (Hotel did refund our parking fees after we spoke). And street parking was quite tricky on the Labor Day weekend. Patrons to PF Changs would park their car on the street too. We were lucky to always get the LAST spot for our car when we return at around 8pm. - ROOM NEAR ELEVATOR IS NOISY ~ We stayed in a room #830, across from the hotel elevators. My boys slept on the pullout in the sitting area. They complained about the noisy elevators and people getting in/out of it. My husband and I slept in the bedroom, and we did not hear the noises. Guess rooms near elevators are ok as long as no one is sleeping in the sitting area. - INDOOR POOL NOT HEATED, AND OUTDOOR JACUZZI IS TINY ~ well, just our preference - FEE FOR WIRELESS INTERNET ~ However you may use the business center computers to get free access to internet. There are only 2 computers. * The frontdesk has printouts of restaurants nearby, mall map as well as a local map of La Jolla. ** There is a small, nice and kid-friendly pizzeria called Regent Pizza on the NE corner of La Jolla Village Dr. and Regent Rd.

Next to a shopping complex and office park. San Diego attractions and neighborhoods are easy to get to from hotel site. Strong point 2 is quality of premises and staff. Personnel are welcoming and efficient. Facilities are well maintained (gardening), exercise facilities/small pool, laundry facilities on premises, business center w/ pcs and printers. Facilities otherwise consistent with Embassy Suites hotels in other cities. Strong point 3 is quality of Embassy Suites features. Complimentary breakfast is top-notch (good selection, quality), efficient (guests served quickly w/o being made to feel rushed). Complimentary manager's reception also first class, not just an afterthought. What we experienced here was better than what we've found at other Embassy Suites locations. Weak point is a $20/night parking fee. I could understand this at a downtown location or with valet services but find off-putting at a self-park suburban location. Another reviewer mentioned on-street parking, but I respectfully disagree: it's really hard, on the spot, to make a snap judgment about availability and safety of on-street parking. To be candid, what bothers me most is the extra charge at a chain that markets lots of features included at a fixed price; had Embassy Suites increased the room rate by $20/night, we'd probably still have chosen the hotel. Our stay was for family travel, and our review is positive. But we'd echo other reviewers and caution business travelers. This hotel offers good service so has high occupancy rates, with lots of couples, families and school groups; this, plus the building's atrium design, generate traffic and some noise.

It's expensive, but all hotels in the area are expensive. For the money and the location (if you want to be near UC San Diego), it was our choice. The Marriott is a little newer but is expensive during the week (great prices on the weekends, though). The Sheraton is nice but is somewhat worn. The Residence Inn is very old and dirty. Embassy Suites has a very impressive, soaring lobby with koi ponds, waterfalls and plants. There is a made-to-order breakfast included that should please everyone. Beware of the price because in-room internet is more ($11.95 a day) and parking is $20 a day. There is lots of free parking on the street as long as you don't try to park on a school day (it's taken early). Make sure the hotel credits you back for parking. There is a nice business center with three computers and a printer that you can use for free (20 minute limit if others are waiting) so you don't need the in-room internet. What we really liked was that there are two rooms in each suite with a real, solid door between them. So many suites don't seem to have two real rooms but this one does.

It wasn't the first choice nor it was out of faint of the heart. However I will admit the loyalty program pays. Most of the business travelers pick their stay based on the location. I am no exception. However keep in mind that the location of the hotel isn't a tourist hotspot, although La Jolla is about 10 miles to the west and the major tourist attractions are down south. What surprised me is that there are a lot of families here, which translates into lots of kids. Guests aside, the hotel is clean, modern and very guest friendly. Free breakfast, 2-hour free drink daily, what else can you ask? I stayed in the Executive suite. Upon check-in I was greeted by if not one of the most friendly staff I've ever met. Prompt service and makes me feel like a valued guest all the way. The room is very clean, nicely lay out and make me feel like home. Now if you staying here on a weekend or peak-tourist periods, you will hear kids. Door closed or not. Some running some screaming, but if that bother you or not is up to you. The bedroom on the other hand is like a standard hotel room but upgraded. Ceiling-to-floor window, comfortable bed and sheets. However if your room is facing the streets, prepare to hearing some car noises. Also the A/C unit can be loud. In my case it actually woke me up when it kicked in. However you can always keep it running to combat the outside noise but it's louder than comfortable level to sleep soundly, if you are a light sleeper. Over all I suggest this hotel to those who wants to get a suite but don't want to pay an arm and a leg for it. However some noise problem might be important to those who likes peace and quiet.

We had a king bed in the bedroom, the kids slept on the pullout sofa in the living room, and there was a refrigerator and coffee maker. The bathroom had a massage showerhead. You did have to be careful going from room to room, however, so as not to get hit by the bathroom door. We appreciated the free drinks at the Managers Reception and the free breakfast. We typically went to breakfast at its busiest hour (8-9 AM), and never had a problem getting seating. The pool was indoors, which was good when it was cool. We ate at the restaurant Indulge twice. Try to sit outside by the fire pit. Laundry was free, which was great, but since there was only one working unit on each of floors 2, 5, and 12 (floors 3 and 4 were out of service), we spent a lot of time going up and down. The concierge Adam was very helpful suggesting nearby beaches where the kids took surfing lessons. Overall, we'd stay here again. The kids practically cried when we had to say goodbye to the lobby!", "Date": "September 4, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tulsa, Oklahoma", "Title": "\u201cStreet Parking Risk\u201d", "Author": "joseph1963", "ReviewID": "UR78224430", "Content": "I read the reviews about the $19 a day parking garage fee and tips to park free on the street.

I was wishing I had parked in the garage but it sounds like it also has a few risks. There were a lot of cars coming and going to the restaurant increasing the odds of accidental damage. Overall, it was a good place to stay. Here are a few of the cons: My son said the sofa bed was very uncomfortable, as the mattress was very thin. The A/C compressor cycled frequently and was noisy despite leaving the fan on all the time and wearing earplugs. The coffee was extremely hot. I was carrying two stacked cups to our room when the top cup tipped and spilled a small amount despite the lid, and left a nasty burn on my chest which is still there. I have never understood why the ES charges for the internet and local calls while the lower-priced hotels offer them free. The staff was friendly. I had booked online and checked the rate two days before the trip finding the rate was reduced from $197 to $170. It was past the cancellation deadline, so I called the hotel and they gave me the lower rate. Two restaurants I would recommend: Point Loma Seafoods on the waterfront had fresh seafood and very reasonable prices as noted by Rachel Ray on one of her shows.

Check in was quick - we arrived at 1 pm, and our room was ready despite of the fact that check in time, I think, is 4 pm.

I didn't hear our neighbors upstaires or in the next room. Location is OK - it took us 10 mins to drive to drive to La Mesa and dine at their \"Red Lobster\". La Jolla shores are 10 mins away as well. It was nice to stroll there in the evening. Seaworld is 15 mins away on I-5. Breakfast and happy hour every day are included in room price. Breakfast could be a little better though. Very limited amount of fruits and veggies. Only banana and oranges, and actually no veggies at all. No yougurt or cottage cheese. At least, Hilton Suites include those items in their free breakfast. Evening happy hour included all kinds of wine and coctails (with the show of ID and your room key), chips and salsa, pretzels and slices of pita bread with little bit of hummus on them. Indoor pool was always crowded though, with kids in particular. I booked this hotel because of it's indoor pool knowing that it can be chilly in SoCal in March-April. My daughter swam there, however, all days - in the morning and in the evening, but I coulldn't get it because of tons of screaming and splashing kids. But that's Ok with me, I didn't want to swim anyways... Pool towels were too tiny, but I guess, it's OK for the kids. Oh, and no robes in the room (just comparing it with Hilton Suites). Also, there was too much chlorine in the pool - I could't comb my daughter's hair after each swim... We haven't tried their restaurant \"Indulge\", but it looked nice in the evening, especially the patio with heated lamps, couches with pillows and fire pits. Not sure if we'll return to this place next time. May be if the prices will be cheaper. I paid around $150 per night.

So an OK-ish hotel wouldn't merit my time, but I feel I have to take a moment to recognize the fact that while the hotel is not a great value or particularly outstanding in other respects, the kindness and professionalism of the staff merit a note: -I woke up one morning and was immediately buried in work and before I knew it, I had missed breakfast. I called down to ask if maybe there was still food at the buffet and they said it had already been cleared away. Two minutes later, they called back and said, \"Can I get the kitchen to whip you up an omelet or something?\" They brought it to my room ten minutes later, no charge.

Living room faces hallway which gives the bedroom some noise buffer. The free breakfast and happy hour are awesome. The fitness room is brand new and has the best cardio equipment I've seen in a hotel. Cons: The $19 parking/night tops the list.

I hate paying for internet but given the room rate we were able to get and it being $10 per 24 hrs I can't complain too much. The big con we experienced on our trip was the obscenely loud new year's eve party that was booked at the hotel. I'm a reasonable person and NYE is the night to party. But I consider it the hotel's responsibility to ensure that all guests' needs and desires are met equally. The noise was so intrusive and pervasive that it was really unacceptable. The party basically turned the lobby/courtyard into a nightclub with all the noise. From our living room, the music was LOUD and with young children trying to sleep, this was a nightmare. We called down to the front desk and were met with the rude response of \"well, it IS New Year's Eve\" along with a very half-hearted \"I will see what I can do\". My wife was so upset that she went down to the front desk and asked to speak with the general manager. At this point, I have to really compliment the general manager (David). Seeing that moving rooms at 10:45PM was not an option for us, The GM listened to our request for partial compensation and graciously agreed. He was courteous, apologetic, and said that he had young kids of his own so he understood the situation.

Lots of restaurants and a nice mall close by with a playground for small children. The few negatives are: the sofa bed was awful - it was ridiculously uncomfortable. The mattress felt like springs with a sheet on top. Every spring was sticking out. They really need to replace them.

Still, it was nice to have the sink, fridge and microwave, however, small. The pool is nice for adults (even has a sauna) but definitely not a place for kids to play, so if your family expects to hang out in the pool, this is not the place.

The fridge and microwave were great to have. They also had a wet bar outside the bathroom, great for cleaning kids snack containers and juice cups. The staff is extremely friendly, did not meet one unhappy member. The check in was great and the service throughout was fantastic. The breakfast was awesome, so much choice and food. But a word to my fellow travelers, please keep in mind than when you show up 15 minutes before the end of food service, there will not be alot left, do not get nasty with the staff they are doing there best to serve hundreds. Perhaps setting your alarm a little earlier would be helpful to ensure you get your first choice for breakfast. As it is they have made to order eggs, sausage, pancakes, cereals, pastries, oatmeal, fresh fruit, yogurt, juices, coffee, bacon, there is no way you can leave hungry!!! As for parking it is $19 a day, but we were there for four nights and always found street parking for free, in the height of tourist season when the hotel was full. The complimentary cocktail hour is very nice, they have pretzels, chips and taco chips and salsa, also full bar service, hard alcohol as well as beer and wine. The hotel itself is very clean, the koi pond is awesome, my kids loved it as did others. There are however, two negatives that I must point out, first, the air conditioner in the rooms is so loud, it sounds as if a plane engine is in your room as it starts up every 20 minutes. If you wake in the middle of the night and it is on you will never fall back to sleep. My recommendation, is to turn the fan off before you fall asleep and turn it back on once you are awake. The other negative is the pool, it is very chorinated I suspect it seems so strong because it is indoors. It would have been nice to have sliding doors to the outside so that so fresh air can come in, his way you won't smell so bad. Other than that I would highly recommend this hotel.

This hotel is within walking distance to several great dining and shopping options in the University Town Center (literally across the street) and bit further to the Costa Verde shopping / dining center. The free cooked to order breakfast was amazing. At first I did not know how extravagant I could (or wanted to) order so I started with a basic omelet (the seemingly most popular order) with your choice of meats, vegetables, and cheese. The next morning I asked for pancakes which were amazing. The cooks will pile on the sides unless you ask them not to. My only complaint was that at around 4:30 am I awoke to the smell of bacon cooking as the cooks were preparing for the morning, but breakfast didn't start until 6am. The best feature was the Manager's Reception featuring complimentary beer (good and bad bear, a locally brewed La Jolla Ale or Bud light), Wine, cocktails, soft drinks and pretzels / chips and salsa. The open floor plan of the lower level gives a great chance to mingle with other guests or to just relax and people watch (there is a hi def tv as well usually on a sports channel, sometimes on news). There were two TVs in my room, a King Suite, one 32inch flat panel in the living room and one large tube TV in the bedroom. The refrigerator had no freezer in my room, but there was a microwave and sink, which worked perfectly for left overs. In the living room there was a desk, a desk chair, a one and two seat sofa. I tried out the outdoor heated jacuzzi and the steam room. Both were very relaxing. Internet is $10 per day, so I used their business center which had everything I needed, internet and a printer.

We picked a hotel in La Jolla instead of central San Diego because we wanted a place convenient to both Legoland and San Diego. This hotel is that - it is about 20 miles from Legoland and about 15 miles to downtown San Diego. It took me only 20 minutes to get to the airport on a Saturday morning - no traffic. This hotel is in a nice, safe area with a lot of apartment buildings and office buildings. There is a shopping mall right across the street, and many small strip malls nearby to get food and groceries. I don't know if anyone ever needs it but there is a post office one block west on Genessee in a little strip mall with a Starbucks. The room was spacious because it had a separate living room with sofabed. The sofabed is very uncomfortable because it is uneven and you can feel the coils in the mattress. The beds in the bedroom are great though, very plush and comfortable. A minor inconvenience was the door to the microwave/fridge. You have to close the living room door to get to the fridge which is covered by shutterdoors, but like I said, it was a minor thing. Apparently you can ask for adjoining rooms because there was a door to the next room right by the sofabed. Something to keep in mind if you have extended families vacationing together. The carpet was a little worn but aside from that, the room had recently been renovated so it looked clean and fresh. Nice touch to have a shower massage head in the shower. The FREE washers and dryers are on floors 2-5 and 12. One set on each of those floors. They are located by the ice and vending machine and are not marked by a sign. You have to walk past the vending machine, and open the door that at first glance looks like the stairwell door. Some washers don't work really well, but hey, I needed to do laundry and it was free. The dryers all worked well. Bring your own detergent if you can, but they have detergent available in the gift shop for $2. If you have more than one load, I found it very convenient to go from floor to floor using the service elevator that is right in laundry room. On other floors the \"laundry\" area is used for storage, so don't expect it to be clean. The staff was friendly and efficient and was very helpful whenever we asked them questions. The free breakfast, their signature cook-to-order hot breakfast grill was as wonderful as usual. The area is very large and provides for many people to be there at the same time. The only time it was crowded was on Friday morning when the next group of spring breakers checked in. That day, I waited in line for an omelet but it took less than 5 minutes to get my order out because they are very efficient. They offer freshly cooked pancakes at the grill but they can also be found in the buffet area, along with bacon and sausage, so you can get a full-on breakfast without having to wait for an omelet. The lobby has a lot of tables and chairs so you can always find a spot to sit, but since there was a table and chairs in our room, we always ate there. They provide trays so you can carry your plates upstairs. The pool is indoors and also has a sauna and hot tub. The fitness center is small but has several treadmills. It is located in the same room as the pool. I thought it was convenient for parents to be able to watch their kids in the pool while being right there in the workout room which is glass enclosed. Also convenient is being able to go into the sauna after a workout, then jump into the pool or hot tub - good floor plan. Other people mentioned that there was ample parking on the street so they didn't have to pay to park in the parking lot, but everytime we got back to the hotel, I couldn't find parking nearby so I had to pay for parking. When I did find parking on the street (once) it was around the block behind the Braille Institute, which is the next building behind the hotel. The rooms are very quiet. I never heard a peep from the people next door, or from anyone passing by the room. However, the air conditioning unit was pretty loud. Everytime it kicked in, I had to turn up the volume on the t.v. I would recommend this hotel for anyone who is visiting the San Diego area even if you are not going to Legoland.

It was simpler to walk into the garage and go. We stayed for a week - November 22 to November 28. The staff was friendly and helpful. My room was clean. The refrigerator was the right size for the things I purchased (drinks, soy milk, snack cheese). We were right across from a mall and a few blocks from Trader Joe's and Whole Foods. (hey, everyone has their special requirements!). There is an advantage to getting \"free\" breakfast quickly and easily every morning for a family of four. The food was good enough and served quickly enough to get us going in the morning. It was one less thing to deal with or worry about. I say \"free\" because it is probably factored into the price. In terms of location, La Jolla is perfect for going downtown to the Zoo or driving up to LegoLand and Disneyland. We tried to get to every destination by 9AM to maximize the time spent and let my son take his afternoon nap. We had no traffic in any direction, so we were either lucky or the location is perfect for traffic avoidance. Our wedding anniversary occurred during the trip.

When we asked about a Mexican restaurant, the concierge was very helpful and informative and he even had a card with printed directions to get to Old Town San Diego. It is a very short drive to Sea World and the San Diego Airport and even Legoland (30 minutes) since it is all on the highway. The breakfast was a great way to starting off the day. The omelets were delicious and the fresh fruits and such a variety of stuff to choose from was a much appreciated bonus of staying at the Embassy Suites. We all (kids included) loved, loved, loved the potatoes that they make there. And being able to bring it back to our room made it easier for our family since we have a couple of early risers and some late sleepers. The next time we are in the San Diego area, we will definitely stay at the Embassy Suites in La Jolla. It is close to the parks and La Jolla is such a nice area to stay in. There is a Trader Joe's and a Ralph's nearby and other food places to eat at in the area. As you can see we really enjoyed our stay. There was a business center with 3 computers and printers where you can access your email. The kids loved the 4 glass elevators and the koi ponds in the atrium. If you need to do laundry there you can use their washer/dryer for free which helped when travelling with a family of 6.

Rooms were clean, big LCD TV in the living room, no complaints there. Also, the continental breakfast was EXCELLENT. The only problem was it was packed. We had to wait in line for twenty minutes before we got to it. Then, the hotel ran out of trays so we had to wait for those. The hotel was completely booked during our stay and it was overrun with families, which isn't bad unless you don't like kids. Also, two of the four elevators broke on the second day which was an absolute disaster. One time i waited ten minutes to go down and get some eggs. I got down there, waited in line for another twenty minutes, then waited another ten minutes for an elevator to go back to my room.

I've stayed at several other ES's in CA and this one was the most modern and aesthetically pleasing so far. This ES seemed more upscale the moment we pulled into the driveway. There was classical music piped into the driveway entrance, bell hops ready for baggage assistance, and the lobby/decor was modern and upscale. Attrium was more open and trendy than the sometimes overgrown green houses of other ES's. Perhaps the limited foliage in the atrium allowed for more noise echoing, conveyed in some of the other reviews. Though, I didn't notice the noise up on the 9th floor. I always ask for an upper level floor to avoid the anticipated people traffic from the atrium, which they normally accomodate for HHonors members. Enroll free online. Overall service was professional, but seemed less personable. The rooms were just as impressive, with a flat panel HDTV in the living room, leather ottomans in both rooms, granite tops on everthing, nice modern decor. Room was very clean. Carpet seemed new. No funky smells/stains. ES breakfast buffet was reliably good, and despite the long lines it moved pretty fast (except for the cook to order line). Suggest getting to breakfast within 1.5hrs of opening to avoid long lines. This place is big ES with 12 floors of hungry guests. The styro plates were a little bit of a let down but perhaps it helped keep things moving. Unlike some other ES's, bussers did a decent job keeping up at this one. Managers reception was reliably good. No skimping on amount of alcohol, but available labels were typically mediocre. Hey, what do you expect for free. Pool was clean and area was well maintained. The only part I didn't like was the additional $17 parking fee and really tight / limited spaces. I wish I would've researched these reviews to get the tip on street parking. A more personable staff would've tipped me on to that. I also didn't get the usual, \"How's everything so far?\" evening call from the manager like at other ES's...guess I'm just spoiled. Kid traffic / noise was better than I expected for a Friday night stay. As with most ES's try to avoid weekends and book as a HHonor member. Would stay again if priced no higher than $175.

You see I was woken up at 5:15AM by a brand new flat panel TV in the breakfast area blasting the news to all those suckers who happen to be sleeping on the sofa bed in the front room of the 2 room suite. If you have never stayed at an embassy suites they have an atrium that all rooms face so it's either really cool or really annoying depending on whether you are deaf or not. When I could no longer take the before dawn intrusion I did what most reasonable people would do, called the front desk. What I got is \"I will call and ask them to turn it down\" funny cause the lobby is what ,30 feet from the blaring TV. So I laid back down waiting for the peace and quite I expect at 5 in the morning. Gues what? someone turned it up. I must have cheesed them off by politely asking them to do, I don't know, their job maybe. I should be ashamed of myself for bothering them and just shut my yap, but funny thing is, I then got a bit mad. I called down again. \"I can still hear it\" \"sir I asked them to turn it down\" \"OK then why does it seem to be louder?\" \"(sigh) I will call them again\" Click. She hung up on me. I must have bothered her again I guess. So again I tucked myself under the cheesy velor blanket trying to recapture my dream. 15 minutes pass. No change in the volume. I heard every news story, every commercial, every Olympic fanfare (It was NBC). That was IT. I called again \"I will get dressed and go down there and turn it down myself\" Silence (from the front desk I could almost hear her thinking \"whatever\" ) Click she hung up on me again. So I get dressed and go on down (hey I was up on the 7th floor) and walked up to the offending TV. Not a single guest watching it. Just blasting to no one in particular. I see a staff member walking by and I ask \"can you help me turn this down\" and she barks at me \"we don't have the remote, we don't know how to do it\" and she walks away. What have I done to deserve this? I checked my breath and my zipper, my nose and my BO and I honestly don't know why I was getting them so upset. I was really really bothering them maybe I should just shut up go back to my room and pay my bill and leave them alone, you know give myself a time out. But hey, I am an adult, I have atayed at maybe 15 different ES and booked trade shows and meeting for a living so I am used to dealing with hotels. The good ones trya nd make their guest feel special, the bad ones, well read on. So, last chance, I walk up to the front desk \"Hi, I am the guy who called about the TV and the folks in the breakfast area says that they don't have the remote\" \"OK sir I just got here what is the problem\" so I repeat my sad tale and she say's to me \"what floor are you on?\" the 7th. She rolls her eyes in disbelief that I could hear it way up there. So she say's \"let me ask Ellen she took your call\" so she steps back and I hear some mumbling and she walsk back and says \"Sir Ellen turned it down herself she has the remote\" \"OK its still blasting, it's not down enough\" . \"Yes it is, sir it's our ploicy to turn the TV's on at 6AM and we can't do anything about it\" Now i am normaly a tolerant fellow who expects a bit of noise from other guest rooms (kids Tv's or just chatter from folks walking down the hall) but I surely did not exext to get \"attitude\" from the front desk for just asking them to turn down the volume. So I say to her \"It's 5:45, and I'ts been on for a while\" \"sir that's our policy, how long will you be with us\" \"One more night\" \"Sorry we can't help you\" I was flabbergassed. Why in the world would I make this stuff up. Do they seriously think I sit there at 5 AM waiting to complain about something. That I am making it all up or just over sensitive? Yes they do, yes they do because what happened next summed up the whole bitter exchange. I said to her \"I hope someone would please go over and listen to the volume\" Ellen never showed her face and her flunky just looked at me and shrugged her shoulders. So I grabed one of those \"tell us how we are doing\" cards and said \"Someone is going to hear about this\" and as I walked away I heard her say under her breath \"stupid\" I turned around and said \"what di you say\" and she say's \"I said It's early\" [--] lady. I heard it correctly the first time. Remember I am the guy that can hear a TV from seven stories up. She never checked it out, never smiled or acknowleged my concern and gte theis, as i walked away she called me STUPID. Thanks Ellen, Thanks rude employee who barked at me in the lounge \"we don't know how to do it\" and a big thank you to the front desk clerk who rolled her eyes ignored my reasonable request and called me stupid. Fianlly a big thank you to Embassy Suites La Jolla. I will never forget you. You know just how to treat your guest, Like [--]. Wow,and it only took me 229.00 to figure it out.

It is a great location, a quiet business district and has easy access from the airport and super easy access to the freeways. It took us about 15 minutes to get to the hotel from the airport in San Diego and it was really easy to find. We made our reservations through a popular internet hotel site and had printed our reservation to prove it, but when we checked in, they had no record of our reservation. But, they were very quick to fix it, we kept our great internet rate (VERY good rate, I think $160) and we were checked in and on our way to the room within 5 minutes. The hotel lobby is really pretty with lots of foilage and beautiful koi ponds. If you're familiar with Embassy hotels, you'll know that most of them have the same open floorplan where all rooms face out to an open atrium with some kind of trees/water. Our room was very nice and had everything that we expected it would have. These rooms are all suites, so they all have a separate living and sleeping area, connected with a little hallway. The livingroom had a sleeper sofa, chair/ottoman, dining table that doubled as a desk, flat screen tv, internet, game system on the tv, and a coffee table/leather ottoman (which is nice if you have toddlers who like to fall and hit their heads on standard wooden/glass coffee tables like we do. :-) ) The hallway has a bar sink, coffee pot with mugs and all of the makings for morning coffee and tea. Across the little hallway is a closet that opens to a mini kitchen. There is a microwave, mini fridge, ice bucket, corkscrew/bottle opener and glasses. The bathroom was large and clean and had nice toiletries and a hairdryer, the only odd thing was the way the door opened wide out, but that is minor, really. Across from the bathroom was a full sized closet with mirrored doors. There is also an iron/board in the closet. The bedroom had a king size bed with nice linens and tons of pillows. We also had a dresser, flat screen tv and nightstands. The bedroom is in the back, away from the hallway and was very quiet. The view was of the parking garage, but that was okay, as we didn't book this hotel for great views. If you want a great view, stay somewhere on the beach. :-) There seemed to be lots of kids and families around the hotel, but it was still very quiet. We never heard anything in our room and slept very soundly. Our daugher loved the koi pond in the lobby. They have some HUGE koi, with nice waterfalls and have even installed a little machine that you can get a handful of koi food to feed the fish for a quarter, which was a big hit with our little one. The breakfasts are great and there is everything you could ever imagine to eat! There is everything from made to order omlettes, bacon/sausage, eggs, pancakes, yogurt, fruit, toast, muffins, oatmeal, coffee, juice......you name it, they have it!! We loved the breakfasts! They have lots of tables set up in the courtyard to take your breakfast at, or you can take a tray to your room, if you'd rather. We never had trouble finding a table, as some previous reviewers stated, nor did we find it overcrowded or the lines long. There are ony two complaints that I would have about this hotel. One is that the parking is really hard to come by and they do charge you for it. We didn't mind the charges so much, as we expected it after reading other reviews, but we didn't realize how few parking spaces there are available. We would come in quite late after spending the day at Disneyland and have a tough time finding a parking spot, which is not what you want to do after you've already driven for over an hour to get to your hotel. When you pay for parking, you expect to not have trouble finding a spot. The other complaint I would have are the elevators. When we checked out on Monday morning, we had to wait *forever* to take the elevator down to the lobby. Had we not been on the 8th floor with a toddler, I would have just walked and would have gotten there much quicker! It seemed that every elevator that stopped at our floor was already full of people on their way to the lobby to check out. A minor thing, really...but, annoying nonetheless. All in all, this is a great hotel!! We couldn't have asked for more, especially for the price we paid. It was perfect. Also, the concierge was really good, they made our reservations on a shuttle to the airport that was really reasonable and right on time. They worked hard to get us all of the info and at the airport on time, it was much appreciated. We will definitely stay here again in the future and would definitely recommend it to anyone on business in San Diego or to families looking for a great base to enjoy Southern California!", "Date": "October 21, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sacramento, CA", "Title": "\u201cKind and Attentive Service\u201d", "Author": "CMFM", "ReviewID": "UR10087893", "Content": "Our thanks and appreciation to the staff at the Embassy Suites, La Jolla for a wonderful stay.

Check in was efficient and welcoming and all of our rooms were ready, clean and comfortable. The front desk made sure my father (who is disabled),was appropriately accomodated. We enjoyed the breakfasts all together and though we were a large noisy group, the staff was cheerful and friendly also taking the time to visit with my father who wanted to show off his family. When we were racing out to the wedding location on Sunday morning, the concierge (Adam?) was extremely helpful in making an adjustment in our handicapped parking assignment, helped with loading Dad's wheel chair and walker and even printed out a map to the wedding location which saved us from getting lost on the way (like my brother :). This same young man also helped my parents considerably when they checked out the next day. There is a great business center that we used for some last minute communications and a convenient kiosk in the lobby to print boarding passes. Some of the family enjoyed the nice pool and steam room. Parking is a challenge if you mind paying $17 per day (ouch) - it is in the heart of an expensive area so it is understandable, but it can add up. Very nice upscale shopping across the street and down the road about a mile or two, more shopping (Trader Joes and Whole Foods) if you are staying longer and want to eat in. Unlike some ES locations, the acoustics here are very good, we did not hear much noise from the atrium/breakfast area (whether you were on 3rd, 5th 7th or 11th floor like we were).

Upon walking into the room, there was Living Room Area with a pull out sofa bed, a large ottoman, a comfy chair, a table with 3 chairs and a flat screen tv. Moving further into the suite there was a bi-fold door and behind that was a microwave, small re-frig and a counter top to prepare and store snacks. On the opposite wall was a bar with a coffee maker, ice bucket and a sink.................there was even a cupboard below for storage of snacks etc. as well. You then go through a door, and to the left was a roomy and very nice bathroom with a tub/shower combo, a hairdryer and stocked with towels and toiletries. To the right, across from the bathroom, was a large closet with mirrored doors, there was a shelf & rod for clothes, a suitcase valet, and an iron& ironing board. At the end of that hall was the bedroom, with 2 double beds, my husband and I had one bed and our 3 and 5 year old boys shared the other bed, there was a dresser/vanity with an ottoman. On the other end of the dresser was a flat screen tv. The complimentary breakfast was wonderful with many choices, cereal, friut, pastries, bagels, donuts, yougurt, juice coffee and best of all the hot breakfast bar.

The location of the hotel is perfect as it is about a mile off the highway and isolated from any highway noise. The hotel lobby was recently remodeled and it looked like they were putting the finishing touches on everyone when we checked in. The check-in process was very easy and we were in our room in no time after a long evening of traveling. The room was pretty spacious for the 3 of us and included an HD flat-screen in the \"living room\", mini-fridge, microwave, and even a bar-sink. 2 of us slept in the king-sized bed and 1 in the pull out queen sleeper sofa. The sleeping arrangements were very comfortable as we were able to close off the 2 sides of the suite for a little privacy. There were a couple of complaints that we had regarding the room and one of them ended up being addressed while we stayed there. The a/c system was very loud when it kicked on and would definitely wake up a light sleeper, and ended up waking me up on a few occasions. The first time we used the shower it would take forever to drain and the 2nd person taking a shower would always stand in a puddle of water. After making a call to the front desk they sent someone up to the room and it was fixed the next time we took a shower. Our rate, as well as everyone else's, included the great breakfast that they put on every morning. There is a large crowd in the breakfast area every day, but the spread that is available was one of the best I have seen in a hotel and we were all very pleased. We ordered room service 1 night and found the food to be very tasty and reasonably priced. A major that we had regarding the hotel itself was the elevators on Sunday (our check-out day). Everyone seemed rushed to get out of the hotel at the same time and this created a huge line at the elevators.

We stayed in a 2 room suite. Here's a rundown: LOCATION If you're on vacation, we found this hotel to be in a perfect location. We were close to everything including lots of great restaurants. SERVICE We found service to be excellent throughout the hotel, including in the food service area. ROOMS We had a king bed in the bedroom. Two of my kids slept in the foldout couch. The third slept on a cot. The foldout couch and cot were too soft in my opinion, but my kids could care less. The rooms are spacious if you're 2 people, with 5 people you might find yourself wishing for more space if you spend any down time in your room. We didn't do much of this so it was of little regard for us. If the rooms have one design flaw it's that the microwave and frig are behind the door the separates the bedroom from the living area when that door is open. In addition, you have to open a pair of doors to open to get to the microwave and frig even when the bedroom door is closed. Typically the bedroom door is open so to get to the frig you have to close the bedroom door, open up the double doors to the frig/microwave area, then open up the frig. Following that you'd close all three. The rooms have been recently redone and look great. Yes, the 42'' HDTV in the living area is awesome. I watched a few minutes of the MLB all-star game on it and it looked great. I can typically find something broken, not working, torn, or busted in any hotel room I stay in regardless of the hotel chain. I tend to think nothing of it. After staying here I week I found absolutely nothing flawed in any way. Even the shower water temperature was shockingly perfect every time and never varied one iota during any shower. PARKING They charge $17/day parking for parking. Overall in this area of La Jolla I noticed that parking was a precious commodity at some restaurants as well. To me you either accept that before you book or you book your stay elsewhere. I accepted it from this perspective: I'm paying an extra $17, but getting a complete breakfast for no additional charge. For a family of 5, I've have paid $40 per day to replace that breakfast, unless we went to McD's every day and that would have gotten very old, very fast. Parking is tight if you try to park during the evening, it's never a problem during the day. Over the course of a week I had to fight to find a parking spot once. COMPLEMENTARY BREAKFAST Overall I thought the breakfast was great. The food was high quality. The omelette's were great, they had pancakes every day, french toast some days. The selection was overwhelming, if you couldn't find something you liked here, then your standards are extremely high for what is mostly a buffet. There's been a significant amount of discussion regarding the crowding. Here's the scoop, there are plenty of tables to sit at. You can sit in the atrium and watch Koi, or eat in the Coast Cafe (they don't do breakfast in the Cafe), or outside on the terrace. The problem is that the layout of the buffet is very poorly done. The cook eggs to order line is at times too long b/c you've got people thinking that's where they're supposed to go even if they don't want an omelette. However you can get anything you want without waiting in that line if you don't want eggs. I found short lines or no lines all week everywhere else in the buffet. But I do agree that there's alot of bumping and jostling going on when you're getting your food. You can avoid all the jostling and crowd if you get to breakfast before 8am during the week and before 9am on weekends. There's can also be a huge difference in the omelette line between 8:20 during the week and 8:29, for example. I spoke with the ass't manager about the breakfast layout. She said it's not a part of the redesign they're doing. However they have been discussing it and are going to look at possible options for making the food selection process flow better. RECONSTRUCTION The front entry area is still under construction as well as the business center. They said they expect the business center to be up by next week. They expect the rebuild to be complete by the end of July.

The location was good, and the rooms were clean and comfortable. We had no issues with parking as some previous posters. The concierge was also extremely helpful. The one thing that marred our stay was the terrible behaviour of their wait and cooking staff at breakfast. During check in, we had asked about breakfast hours. We were informed that it was from 6-9am and that as long as we got there a little before 9am, we would be able to enjoy the buffet till past 9. Taking these words to heart, we went down at 8.50am (we were on vacation!!) and stood in line to get our cooked food. 9am came along and in the blink of an eye, the line for cooked food was shut off, the shutters to the kitchen came down, the cold food including fruit, bread and cereal were cleared. Even plates were taken away. My niece asked the staff for an apple (he had just cleared it and placed the basket of apples on his trolley right in front of him) and he refused!!! The staff told her that breakfast closes at 9am and so she could not have the apple! I can accept the cooked food station closing on time but most decent hotels, leave the cold food for at 15-20 mins before shutting it down. Also, they will inform diners that the buffet is closing. Nothing of this sort happened at the Embassy Suites. I guess that Embassy Suites is just a good hotel wannabe, that has not quite succeeded. Anyway, quite appalled by this, I went to the speak to the front desk to give feedback, only to be told \"That's just the way it is here. Breakfast shuts down at 9am\". I'm not sure if our feedback reached management, because the next morning, the Food and Beverage manager was present at breakfast, and this time, the cold food buffet stayed open about 10 minutes past nine.

We actually extended our stay by one night. Our request was promptly taken care of and we even were given the promotional rate for the 2nd night as well. The only negative about our stay was the sound of little kids running around downstairs in the atrium/lobby level early in the morning. The sound really carries and it seems that parents had no control over their little \"cherubs\" in the morning.

There were always plenty of spots available, but there is no handicap access to the top 2 floors. The breakfast (complementary) area was extremely packed, but was really quality food, hot, cleaned often, and attended well. The morning staff truly excelled. There were 3 busses of soccer and lacrosse high school students that arrived on Thursday night, making the pool, breakfast area, and lobby pretty much unpleasant for anyone over 18, and the elevators were apparently, play things. Not a whole lot the hotel staff could have done other then the way it was handled (pulling kids off elevators, doing an excellent job with the breakfast even with the cramped conditions, etc.). The lukewarm water was unpleasant on Friday, but Saturday it heated well, after a few moments. University Towne Center (UTC) is right across the street, and was a wonderful day trip for me while my husband completed his meetings. La Jolla Shores was a mere 10 minutes away, and the concierge was wonderful in getting directions and information about the goings on there.

This property clearly markets aggressively to get huge families on vacation from Latin America. Makes the breakfast area hopelessly unusable. 30 minute waits for everything. Even worse, there is no nearby substitute restaurant (a solution I have used at other Embassy Suites) 3) No hot water circulation system. Not a business travel problem, but inexcusable for such a premium property. Have to wait 5-10 min for the hot water to warm up all the pipes between the basement and the top floor before you can take a shower. Premium properties worldwide usually have a system that constantly circulates hot water on each floor to avoid this lag. 4) Inept laundry service. Was 2 hours late.

Garage is reasonably nice, but they want $17/day for it and they have to fumble around with your room number every time you drive in and out.

Just chips and salsa, not even veggies which Oxnard always serves. Had taquitos in SLO. No make your own waffles like in Oxnard and Monterey. They don't even sautee the veggies for the omelette, just slap in some egg and served to you. They just started renovating this hotel, the 3rd and 4th floors were completely closed. I was not told when I made the reservation on ES but was told at check-in. Probably was not a problem unless you were planning on spending lots of time in your room, but Sat. AM we were awakened by hammering sounds at 8 am. Thought that was inappropriate, and was just pissed that I wasn't told at reservation time. I think that is sneaky!! Ditto on the room arrangement. Bedroom nice size but the living area is small and the microwave and fridge blocks hallway if you want in. There are always doors swinging and blocking someone. We asked to switch rooms, as we had one on opposite side of elevators, which bedroom window overlooked large A/C compressor and main street. They offered to move us from 7th to 11th floor, but with same side of bldg did not seem worth it. As it turned out, the A/C and fan in the room makes a lot of noise and blocked whatever street noise we were anticipating. $15/night for parking is a ripoff, but I guess parking is tight in this rich town. ALso, the bellhop nearly rushed us at the door. Frankly I prefer to take the cart and do it myself, but guess they don't want to be screwed out of a tip. Kids liked the pool, but it is small. Would have been nice if they had a pool table or video game room like Monterey. My kids loved it there! Actually, Seaside, adjacent to Monterey. All in all we like this chain because of the freebies and the private bedroom. Oh yeah, usually in Embassys you can bring your own DVD or video game systems, and just plug in to the TV through the A/V inputs, but in this hotel, they have deactivated the inputs. They want you to pay for movies and games. I expect that in other hotels, but most other Embassys I have done this so I was disappointed.

Taking the advice of others, we requested a room high up and not facing the street. The rooms are a bit small and narrow. We have stayed at other Embassy Suites and this was by far the smallest as far as room size. The walls were pretty thin and although we had a stairwell on one side (no noise there) we were able to hear the baby and singing father next door for at least one of the nights. Having kids of our own we understood but it tells you how thin the walls are. The room had a weird configuration where the door separating the bedroom from the living room opened and blocked the doors leading to the microwave and refrigerator. We found this a bit annoying. We did like the Koi ponds in the lobby. All rooms have a window facing out as well as a window facing the inner atrium. This atrium is over 14 floors high with the pond and breakfast dining area in the court yard. The location is great. Right next to the 805 freeway and across the street from the University Town Center outdoor mall. There are all kinds of places to eat and shop there. You do have to cross a major street (almost like a freeway the way people drive so stroller pushers beware) and it ends up being about 2 or 3 blocks until you find any restaurants. The UTC area is quite fun once you are there. There is also a mini play ground near Sears and a bunch of fountains through out. Some very accessible to little ones who want to get wet. The somewhat frilly Chinese food restaurant PF Changs is right outside the entrance. A bit pricey for small servings of Chinese food but from the wait and valet lines you would think they were givng it away. More on the hotel. It does have a indoor swimming pool but it is rather small. More for taking a dip than trying to do laps. And it is strange but they put the jacuzzi just outside the doors in the outside with lounge chairs available. The breakfast was not bad but they seem to limit the omelets to just one type every morning. No custom omlets which I have seen at other Embassy Suites. The Manager's reception was the usual chips and salsa and drinks but what do you expect for free? I read a review about a watch being stolen but I suppose the best advice is not to leave valuables lying around. It made me a little anxious about the staff but then again why would you want to take that chance? There is a parking lot where you basically have to pay the $15/day to park. I really don't know what happens if you tell them you don't have a car or just park across the street in the mall. There are also some unregulated spaces that do not require an entrance gate so I don't know who monitors those. The parking thing always annoys me but I know about it in advance so what can you do?
