It was very nice to have the extra space, and 2nd bathroom. Kitchen and living area were nice. Property itself was average, nothing \"Beverly Hills\" about it. Only one elevator at this property. I was glad to have requested a low floor so we could use the stairs. This hotel does offer a free shuttle within a 3 mile radius. This was very nice to use as cab rates are extremely high. However the shuttle stops at 6:30pm which is early. We didn't take advantage of the daily breakfast, but rather ate across the street at Factor's Famous Deli. The food was good and reasonably priced. Most of the hotel staff were friendly with the exception of one nighttime front desk clerk. He had an attitude and was full of sarcasim. Not what I expect out of people employed to assist other people. We did have an issue our second night with drunk, noisy neighbors. I had to call the front desk twice. Not sure if anything was done about their noise, or if I just finally fell back asleep. I was awakened around 1am with screaming, and what sounded like breaking furniture. I was not happy about that! Hotel is within walking distance of restaurants in Beverly Hills, i.e CPK and Cheesecake Factory. Several local eateries too that looked really nice.

But we had some special needs and it seemed to fit the bill. I'm a Platinum Marriott guest with lots of experience with different hotels and specifically Residence Inns. This is a great one. The bedroom was a bit small, but sufficient. We had to rearrange some furniture to fit a pack and play in the room. The room was very updated, clean, and well stocked. The hotel lobby was very modern (usually not the case) and it felt much more like a full service hotel. The hotel was quiet. We had a bad view of another building, so maybe that helped since we were facing the street. The bed was really comfortable. We pulled out the sofa bed one morning and it had a new mattress and was as comfortable as a sofa bed can be. The front desk staff was extremely friendly accommodating to some requests we had traveling with a 2 year old. Also, allowed us to check in early. The room wasn't ready when we arrived but they sent housekeeping to tend to it and we were in the room in 15 minutes. Breakfast was a bit of a zoo as is with every free Residence Inn breakfast, but there were at least 2 people staffing it every morning and they did a great job. Kept if stocked well. Every single morning somebody helped me get the 2 year old situated while trying to navigate the zoo. I didn't ask for help and it was somebody different every time. So that says to me that they have a culture of helping. I was pretty bummed about the self parking fee/valet fees, but valet was quick and I did not care once we were there. Also, we had a visitors at the hotel twice and they did not charge them. We spoke to them in advance and they said it wasn't a problem. I also had to have something retrieved from the car once, and they ran all the way there and all the way back. Famous Deli across the street was super amazing.

They apoligized for the elevator, and said that if I called in advance, they would see if they could find a room with a bed that had access from both sides. Am I missing something ? I have never stayed in a room at these rates that was not big enough to accomodate walking room around the bed.

This was my first mistake! Apparently, when this hotel \"confirms\" a room it isn't the same as \"guaranteeing\" a room. And even then, it's not guaranteed. 1-2 days before our flight, I received a call from the Mariott ADA desk (kudos to them) that the 2-bedroom accessible suite wasn't available for the reserved dates. He put me on hold to confer with the hotel and when he came back to the phone said that a 1-bedroom accessible was available, and emailed a \"guarantee\". He said this was a firm \"guarantee\". While I was a bit upset because this meant I wouldn't have the option of staying in the suite and would incur the additional cost of another room, I was glad that at least the other suite was available. When we arrived at the hotel the next day, however, we were informed by the front desk that the accessible suite wasn't available until the next day :(. This meant that my ailing, 85-year old father had to come down from his room later that evening and use the public bathroom by the hotel bar so that he could have a toilet with grab bars. To be fair, the Manager was apologetic and charged for a 1-bedroom while putting them in a 2-bedroom for the night (and slightly reduced the rate for the remaining days), but this is unacceptable for a hotel of this stature and price point. The Manager promised that the accessible room would be available in the morning, and that by the time we finished breakfast the next day my dad's and caregiver's bags would be transferred to the new room. The next day at 12noon the room still wasn't ready so we went out for a couple hours. When we returned at 2pm I asked the front desk if their bags had been transferred to the room. The employee looked at us like we'd done something wrong, asking where we were and saying he'd called the room because it was past checkout time and put the bags in storage. In the transfer, some medical equipment of my dad's was lost and I had to throw out several dairy food items that had gone unrefrigerated. Needless to say, this wasn't a good way to start a vacation! Had I known weeks before while planning the trip that this was going to be the situation, I would have organized the trip differently, either making alternate hotel arrangements, or going to Palm Springs before Los Angeles so that we could be there when the 2-bedroom suite was available. If you require an accessible room or are traveling with someone who does, I recommend calling the hotel directly to obtain a guarantee for the room. Then I recommend crossing your fingers.

They made me take my bags up to my room myself as they only had one bellman. Any requests or favors you ask will be turned down. They are woefully understaffed and only have 1 person handling all the bags and all the cars. Expect to spend most of your time waiting for something if you have a request. Other issues they dont tell you about: 1. Parking is $25 dollars / night and there is no street parking available. 2. Their rooms and hallways wreaked of marijuana and smoke - so you know what type of people are hanging out there. 3. The breakfast is terrible and the dining room is very dirty 4. They give you used sheets. This hotel has terrible reviews and deserves them because of their staff. If I had to pay an extra 100 dollars to go across the street to stay at the crown plaza, it would be well worth while. I would NEVER stay here again!!!", "Date": "December 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Corona, California", "Title": "\u201cAnother Outstanding Visit!\u201d", "Author": "billandrowena", "ReviewID": "UR121784367", "Content": "I stayed at this hotel earlier this year for the first time and my wife and I had a wonderful stay.

As for breakfast, their omelet station during the weekdays was a huge plus for me. I have not seen an omelet station in any other RIs. The location is superb. It is not in the center of Beverly Hills, but is a short walk to the area on Beverly Drive where you find many nice restaurants and shops. Rodeo drive is about a mile away.

The room was very spacious, with a huge king bed (my partner is 6.7\u201d, so this was great for us), queen sofa bed, large bathroom and full kitchen with dishwasher, fridge and microwave. Travelling with a toddler the kitchen made things so much easier. The hotel offered a lot more than the previous hotel I stayed in across the road and it was cheaper: complimentary breakfast, shuttle bus, guest laundry, free wifi and guest computers in the lobby to name a few things. The breakfast was a great bonus, omelettes, waffles, fresh fruit, cereal etc a great way to start the day. The free shuttle bus will run you to most places within a 3 mile radius. Rodeo Drive, Farmers market, Century City or Beverly Centre. The no 7 rapid bus to Santa Monica stops across the road and for $1 you can be at the pier in 20 minutes. Around the corner on Pico Boulevard is a large Ralphs Supermarket and a CVS drugstore for all you needs.

The hotel is beautiful - really pretty dark wood, reds and orange accent colors, lots of cool plants and accent pieces. It really felt more like I was in a boutique hotel. My room was just as great! Awesome TV, comfy couch & bed, great desk with good light and extra plugs. The entire place is SPOTLESS - room, hallways, elevators, the whole place is soooo clean. And the kitchen was great - I got dinner at Factor's Deli (across the street) and brought my leftovers back with me. I had my car, but it was so nice to walk around to get something to eat (Factor's Deli is awesome and turns out they also do the room service for the hotel too). There's a Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf around the corner, and a few other places. Ended up back at Factor's for lunch on Saturday (try the Grilled Cheese and Hot Corned Beef on rye!) I also did some sightseeing while I was there and was really close to a lot of things. Great new shopping center in Century City was really nice. I saw some of the reviews mentioned noisy, but I actually had a street view with 2 huge windows facing Pico and I didn't hear a thing. It was REALLY quiet. Free WiFi in the hotel was a nice bonus too. Connection was good, no drops, and really pretty fast. The staff was great - parking, front desk, bellman, breakfast. Everyone was really friendly.

The first night we stayed at the hotel we had brought with us a bottle of Cabernet. We ordered a delivery of food for dinner and ate in the room. This of course entailed many plastic containers and bags, which we threw in the trash when we were done. We drank about 2/3rds of the wine and put the rest in the fridge. I also drank most of a bottle of Sprite and put what was left in the fridge also. The next morning we ate breakfast at the hotel. which was included and very good. We went back to the room and put the do not service magnetic sign on the outside of the door and went out for the day. When we returned around 4:30 pm I went to the fridge to have a drink of the sprite and noticed the wine and sprite were gone. Next I went to the trash to throw away a few items we had used that day in our travels and the trash was emptied. I called the front desk and they told me they would check the key card record to see who had entered the room. Turns out they say there were just three entries that day, two during breakfast and one when we got back to the room. I didn't know what to say because I know we left the wine and sprite in the fridge and we certainly didn't empty the trash. Later that evening we noticed that the card with television stations on it we had used the night before was missing so we couldn't look up the channels we wanted. One last thing, my wife had doodled on the not pad in the room and that was missing too. The bed was not made up and no other changes were observed. The front desk said they would check with the head of housekeeping, but we haven't heard anything from them. The only thing I can guess is that maybe we didn't close the door all the way and a maid started cleaning the room before she noticed the do not service sign on the door that was propped open. The wine was no big deal, but it should not have been taken. Also, they made me feel as if I was lying or something. I didn't demand anything, I just wanted to know what happened. The air conditioning stays on and off too long so the room was either too hot or too cold. I finally found a window that opened partially and turned on the fan at night the second evening which allowed us to sleep much better. Other then this incident the staff was courteous and the room is nicely priced for the location.

I got room 118 and it seemed OK until about 5am the next morning when the stench of tater tots and grease woke me up along with the very loud sounds from the street. I called down to the front desk to complain about the smell and I was told that I was directly above the kitchen and that is why my room smelled. I asked to be moved and they said they had several rooms on a higher floor that would get me away from the smell and the noise from the street. I then asked why they didn't give me one of the rooms to begin with?? So at 530 am I had to pack up all of my clothes (which smelled like kitchen grease) and all of my belongings to be moved. I was then told by the employee that moved me that he would take care of the room on my bill. I assumed this meant he would comp me the night since I had to move in the middle of the night but later found out that they only gave me a $50 credit. That was fine but when I talked to the employee at the front desk I was told I could ask for 25,000 points on my Marriott Rewards card. They took my name and number and said the manager would call me the next day to talk to me. I never got a call from the manager and when I followed up with Customer Service they agreed that I should also get points credited to my Marriott Rewards Card. They passed along my complaint to the manager of the hotel who then decided to respond to my issues. He/she stated that since there are kitchens in the hotel some rooms may smell of food. This was not true in my case since once I went in the hallway there was no stench of kitchen grease, it was only in my room because of the venting from the kitchen. Next they told me that there were not many extra rooms because of the NBA All-Star game. I checked in on 2/14, the game was on 2/20 so that was obviously a lie. And then they said they could not give me a credit of Marriott Rewards Points unless I authorized them to charge my credit card $50.

When I have the chance to stay at a Residence Inn it's always icing on the cake. I love the oversized rooms with full kitchen, refrigerator and microwave. The Residence Inn at Beverly Hills seemed to be the perfect choice on my business trip to Los Angeles to do studio press coverage. It's located within walking distance to Fox studios which I found very convenient. The rooms here seem a tad smaller than most Residence Inn rooms I have stayed in, though there is still plenty of space. What is a little different is that instead of there being a separate bedroom and living room divided by wall and door, it is combined into one large room. In the center is a small desk that is perfect for computer work. The room comes with complimentary high-speed Internet access however the wired router in the room (#516) was broken. I didn't complain about it since the wireless access was pretty darn fast though it required you to login several times throughout the day instead of only once. The room itself is clean. The bed was immensely comfortable with a nice firm mattress, lots of pillows and extra blankets in the closet. Despite the fact the hotel is located on a busy street corner of the city I was never bothered by the traffic below and never heard any sounds from my neighbors. I slept very well. By the way, the rooms have a nice iHome clock radio for you to dock your iPhone or iPod touch. It was a real treat coming downstairs in the morning to a complimentary hot and cold breakfast that contained (on a rotational basis) eggs, sausage, biscuits with gravy, home potatoes, yogurt, cereals, waffles, muffins, bagels and english muffins. During select weekdays there is complimentary food and beer served in the restaurant. All this praising is met with one major gripe: the parking. It is valet and the price is exorbitant at $22 plus a $2.50 tax per night. First, it's very inconvenient not to be able to immediately access your vehicle. Also, at nearly $25 per night are you supposed to tip the valet drivers the multitude of times you need to retrieve your vehicle throughout the day? My God, this is a Marriott forcing you to pay a rate that should be half its price. I know there have been a lot of complaints expressed here on Trip Advisor. I know management is reading them. Suggestion: drop your valet parking to $12 per night. Stop gouging your guests. All the griping aside, I was very satisfied with my stay here. However, next time I am in town I might do a little more research for a hotel in this price range that doesn't gouge its guests on valet parking rates. Otherwise, highly recommended.", "Date": "November 2, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Culver City, California", "Title": "\u201cVery enjoyable stay!!!\u201d", "Author": "Jerry7722", "ReviewID": "UR79430977", "Content": "We just returned from our stay at the Residence Inn Beverly Hills.

I stay at Marriotts because they are predictable, generally clean and convenient. I recently stayed 9 nights at the Beverly Hills Residence Inn followed by another 3 night stay. I also never write reviews about a Marriott hotel on tripadvisor, however, this hotel compelled me to change my ways. First of all, this hotel is a great value. You get a studio room with a small kitchenette all for less than $200 a night... in LA! There are not too many other hotels around (other than a dump) that offer that kind of pricing for what you get. Secondly this Residence Inn has all the typical qualities of a Residence Inn (free breakfast and internet) and more. When you check in there are a number of people on hand to help you...feels more like a regular Marriott. They also have a bellman...not typical for a Residence Inn and they have safes in every room...not even Marriott hotels have this amenity, and when you are staying for multiple nights it is a great thing to have. They also have a small bar that is open Monday to Friday and every Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday night they offer snacks, wine and beer. Unlike other Residence Inns they restock the snacks regularly over the snack hour so even if you arrive well after the start you can still get something to eat. Location wise the hotel is pretty central to most of LA. The area is quiet at night and there is a supermarket just up the street that is open from 6am to 1am daily. There are a couple of dry cleaners in easy walking distance and the hotel also has a Hertz desk if you want to rent a car for the day. The rooms are quite spacious and always clean. The layout is different from room to room. This building was originally a hospital so that explains the huge elevators and different rooms. Overall this is not only a great Residence Inn but a very good hotel. The only small gripe is that parking is valet only and $20 per day (the daily charge does decrease depending on the number of days you stay). The valets are very fast so you never have to wait for your car, however, paying for parking at a Residence Inn just seems wrong. In the hotel's defense, this is LA and every other hotel in the area charges for parking and a number much more than $20.00. If the hotel changed the fee to $10.00 per night I would think that would be reasonable for a Residence Inn. As I said...small gripe. The staff are great, the hotel is more than you would expect and location is central.

To see Rodeo drive or a bit of the town, you had to walk a bit up the road (4 blocks) but it wasn't so bad considering it wasn't hot out for a summer day. The food is expensive in some areas, however we found a great sushi place for lunch that was plentiful for around $10.00. Shopping was expensive (on Rodeo drive) where all the stars shop of course! What was great about this hotel was it was a 5 minute walk to the Pavillion grocery store. We picked up some snacks, water and lunches for cheap. Free high speed internet, a fitness room and a spa pool were all included in the rate. The only thing that really bothered us was the parking is not free. It's about $22 a day plus tax!

I spent 20 years living 5 blocks from the hotel before moving east, so I wanted the convenience and familiarity of my old 'hood. Since it was a 4-night stay, I passed on the fancier places in the area (Century Plaza, Bev Hilton, etc.) where I'd have to cope with much smaller rooms and lots of tourists. This hotel does it right. While the room wasn't plush, it was clean, contemporary, functional (a pleasure, since I'd just been at a hotel where nothing worked), easy free internet access, well-stocked and spacious with living room and kitchen/desk areas. They honored my specific advance room request upon check-in, handled a minor problem promptly. The staff is lovely, particularly all the guys in the garage, and the entire place is managed very well. It's very convenient to the Westside. A few points/thoughts: --Yes, $22/day parking for in/out privileges is expensive in broader sense, but not only is that standard in LA at hotels, a friend stayed at the nearby Intercontinental Century City and paid about $35/day. The garage staff moved fast, brought up/took away cars quickly and was very helpful with packages (and with me, since I caught a bad cold and was barely moving at one point). --The free breakfast can be a zoo. I wound up hitting the market nearby and making coffee and bagels in my room, thanks to the coffee pot and fridge. There's a huge Ralphs supermarket a block away (that property also has a giant CVS, a few other shops and restaurants). Factor's, one of LA's most popular delis, is a block in the other direction. Area's very safe to walk around, even at night. --While the hotel isn't near any tourist sites, no hotel in the town really is. It's LA: there's little opportunity to walk to your destinations, since they can range from Hollywood to Santa Monica. Cabs are also very expensive and scarce: rates are high, it could be 20 miles to your destination and it's not a town where you can simply flag a cab, which means keeping a cab phone number on hand and being willing to wait. Either rent a car or if you're unwilling to drive the freeways or have only occasional travel needs, arrange 1/2 or full-day driver service. This doesn't have to be done through the costly limo companies; many cab companies offer day rates.", "Date": "January 20, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle, Washington", "Title": "\u201cVery good deal, with great breakfast!\u201d", "Author": "CaliforniaPlanner", "ReviewID": "UR53023723", "Content": "We stayed at this hotel for one night passing through L.A.

We booked a tour, and the drop off location was Farmers Market, about 3.5 miles from the hotel. We did not want to use our car during the day in LA, as parking and traffic get really bad. So the hotel shuttle dropped us off at the Farmers Market (ask for Guillermo at the valet, he is very helpful). It is nice to get to the marker a little bit earlier then the tour start time. We walked around, did window shopping. Since it was around Christmas time, the area was really beautiful. After the tour was over, were dropped off at the same location. From there you can take bus number 217, it will take you all the way to Hollywood Boulevard ($1.25 one way, be prepared to have exact changes, these buses do not give change). From Hollywood Boulevard we took 217 again and then switched to bus 4 at Santa Monica Boulevard. That bus took us to Crescent stop, which is a 1 1/2 block from Rodeo Drive. We found taking buses much easier then driving in LA, although there are some weird people who ride those buses, so keep your belongings close. The hotel does offfer ccomplimentary breakfast, as all Residence Inns do. Sat/Sun morning there were quite a number of people, but you can sit inside, in the lobby and outside. Parking is $24, expensive, but is it LA. Beds are the best of course, like with any Marriott. The hotel does not have a restaurant on property, but there have the menus of some restaurants in the area that will deliver right to your guest suite. We found it very convenient; after sitting in LA traffic for 4 hours, it was very pleasant to have the food delivered. Order from Famours Farmers (I think this is what they are called); excellent food, and you can actually charge to the guest room or pay cash, No pool, just jacuzzi, but a big one; and a fitness center. Staff was pleasant. The room was had was quite small, studio with a queen bed and a sofa sleeper. Once you open up the sofa sleeper, not so much space in the room.

Great location, I felt safe as a single woman traveler and truly, the extra bit of attention I got from the entire staff (including housekeeping...thanks for the extra towels!) was great!", "Date": "March 25, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Utah", "Title": "\u201cAvoid this Hotel - Poor Management\u201d", "Author": "SteakSnob", "ReviewID": "UR26088187", "Content": "Residence Inns are typically a reliable chain of business hotels ran by Marriott. Known for their large refrigerators and oversized rooms - a business traveler's best friend can be these types of hotels. This Residence Inn in Los Angeles - right on the border of Beverly Hills - is an old hospital that was converted into a hotel. You will notice that the hot tub is actually an old physical therapy pool and it is two levels underground. While it is open 24 hrs a day, unless you like relaxing in a dungeon type of environment, it is not an ideal set up. There is a gym underground as well. Only one of the elevators actually goes down to the gym and hot tub so you have a guessing game to play because you cannot query the elevator when you want to go down. Parking at the hotel - Don't even bother. Residence Inns are typically known for the complimentary parking - and while this is in LA and it is very difficult to park on the street without getting ticketed. The valet staff will tell you they do not allow self park - which in fact the hotel does if you ask. A separate company runs the valet parking and they are an abrasive group of people. The first week we were at the hotel we parked here but quickly learned it was too much of a hassle to deal with the valet staff. Park across the street at the Crowne Plaza - it is cheaper and the parking attendants are much more friendly. Breakfast at this Residence Inn is very good - excellent help staff and wonderful cooks. In fact if the rest of the employees at the hotel were as good as the maids and breakfast staff, this would be an exceptional hotel even with the awkward hospital layout. Dinners are not near as good as the breakfasts, for the days they serve them and you may as well skip them all together. Finally, we had some minor damage that was done to our rental car by one of the valet staff when we were at the hotel. When we asked to talk to a supervisor, it seemed like he was never available. Finally we were told to fill out a claim form, noting the damage and the incident. The next day after we filed the report - once again asking for the supervisor - one of the valets produced a parking stubb that had written on it the exact damage that we reported in the incident report. He then claimed he saw us do the damage to the car and it was our fault. The time and date he said when he witnessed the incident was a time neither the car or any of us were at the hotel. As a frequent business traveler - this is by far one of the most bizarre and unimaginable situations ever experienced. Appealing to the Residence Inn Manager did no good either. This hotel, due to the unconventional layout and rather coarse management style, is probably the reason the rooms are heavily discounted on deal sites like Priceline. We would recommend avoiding this hotel until both the management and valet company have been removed and replaced with more typical friendly Marriott Residence Inn folks that we're use to dealing with.", "Date": "March 12, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Miami, Florida", "Title": "\u201cI'd stay there again\u201d", "Author": "GEOFFS3", "ReviewID": "UR25953488", "Content": "I booked this property because I had a free night certificate I had to burn up......But I must say that it met my expectations right on and I'd return if I was in the area.

The rooms are as comfortable as in most Residence Inns (though they're smaller), and the valet parking system is fast and cheerful. Now for the drawbacks: (1) Most rooms face busy streets, and inner \"courtyard\" facing rooms on lower floors receive noise from HVAC equipment -- only courtyard-facing rooms on high floors are dependably quiet, and that's not many rooms; (2) The breakfast area and service in this Residence Inn is an unmitigated disaster: Horribly mediocre food that runs out if the hotel is near capacity, a tiny dining space for a hotel of this size, and service that has to be reminded to replace the coffee when it's run out. Also, while the reception staff and valet parkers are pleasant, this hotel has a rather detached atmosphere.

I would HIGHLY recommend my family, friends and Collegues to stay at the Residence Inn Beverly Hills . My room was beautiful and extremely spacious. We not only had a california king size bed but our own kitchen area and small living room! I know my fiancee' was EXTREMELY ESTATIC to have a 42' inch flat screen TV that swiveled toward the couch or toward the bed!!! Another great feature this hotel has is it's location, location, location!!! So close to everything that any person in L.A. would want to see; The beach, Beverly Hills (all it's great sitngs), Hollywood, Universal Studios etc... The convienence of free internet was another GREAT PERK to have during my visit. It made my stay stress free for any buisness concerns I may have had by being able to access my email. I can go on for hours but last but not least the nice breakfast every morning got my day going!! So all in all this hotel gets an A++++++++++++++++++++++ from me and I look forward to returning shortly!", "Date": "August 20, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "ca", "Title": "\u201cSpectacular stay at the Beverly Hills Residence Inn\u201d", "Author": "jazz99", "ReviewID": "UR8373253", "Content": "The hotel offers a delicious, FREE breakfast, FREE hotel shuttle, The staff were extremely friendly & accommodating.

Room 530 was awful. The bathroom area smelled from cigarette smoke (the entire hotel is non-smoking). One of the lamps was not working (bulb was replaced, but it cost me a $2 tip). It is long and skinny giving it a claustrophobic feeling. There is a mirror directly facing the toilet. Worst of all is the location of the air conditioner. The vent was directly over the bed. A seeming gale force icy wind would periodically freeze us in bed. We had to set the thermostat higher than we liked to avoid being iced over. Then in between icings, we would wake up too hot. Who ever designed this room and similar ones on other floors should lose their architect's license. We had requested a handicapped studio, but none were available. So we requested a room that would have the shortest walk from the elevator. I did not report the problem to hotel management, since nothing could be done about it. We weren't about to change rooms in the middle of the night. I adjusted the vent the best I could, to little avail. If you choose to stay here, specify some room other than x30 across from the elevator.", "Date": "July 29, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Circusfolk", "Title": "\u201cFantastic Hotel Close to Everything\u201d", "Author": "Circusfolk", "ReviewID": "UR8230597", "Content": "The hotel is great for the first time traveler to LA like I was.

The area feels fairly safe. We had a clean, modern 2 bedroom suite with a living room, kitchen, and two bathrooms. It was reasonably priced for such a large suite with a complimentary breakfast. We faced the interior of the hotel where there was no view, but we preferred this since we had no street noise at all. (In LA you won't spend much time in the suite anyways if you are a tourist). The valet parking was easy (no delays). There is a Ralph's grocery store within a short walking distance.
