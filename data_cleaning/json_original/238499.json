{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Gone down hill since last year We stayed at the Hotel le Due Fontane over a year ago and we felt it had gone down hill since then, which is a shame because this hotel is in a great location. It has now dropped to a 2 star hotel, the rooms are very basic and the new owner does not seem to care if you have a problem or not. We came back to our room one day to find the porter and the maid sitting on our bed together watching tv. What upset me more was they had been through my suitcase and placed a couple of items that were in the bottom of my suitcase on the bed. This hotel needs to be renovated to get it up to its previous standard. I would stay elsewhere until they do some work on this hotel.", "Date": "Oct 27, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR286733632", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Winnie999"}, {"Content": "Friendly Staff The hotel staff was very helpful and friendly.

In a very old building.(Once owned by the Medicis.) You are very near to many of the historic sights. Our room was surprisingly big and had an elegant new bathroom. Breakfast good, for being in Italy. The staff was of different moods. Some friendly, and some not so happy. Stay away from the right side (facing the entrance) rooms on 1:st floor. (If You don`t like free Italian lessons from night beer drinking figures.) I had read bad stories about the hotel, and expected the worst. (Coming with a group. So the choice was not ours.) We stayed only 2 nights, but 5 more had not been to much. We will choose this hotel next time in Florence. Many in our group estimated Due Fontane as one of the best in our Italian Tour.

The staff were pleasant. Mini bar well stocked with drinks.However, the rooms were incredibly dusty - the floor was covered with dust and at no time was it swept in the four nights we were there. The room needed a good deep clean too. Do not go here if you have breathing problems!The sewerage smell I think is more to do with a hot, old city rather than the hotel itself. Mosquitos were a problem, but again not the fault of the hotel! The air conditioning worked well.The food was awful. We only had breakfast - terrible quality, the orange juice was not orange juice - more like a kidney rotting fake drink. Luckily there was a good few pizza places around the corner, serving great food.The shop in the hotel is handy, but expensive. Just around the corner (turn left as you leave the hotel's main entrance, left again down the first road, heading toward the dumo) there is a supermarket. 2ltr bottles of water for 50 cent, much cheaper! There was a guy in a wheelchair begging outside this every day, but we later saw him leap up out of it and walk down the road while his buddies carried the chair off. This is a problem in Florence - people who act like they can't walk one minute will be legging it down the road the next - don't fall for it!", "Date": "Jul 26, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR778001981", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "pinkflowers"}, {"Content": "Unforgettable for the wrong reasons I stayed for two nights but hardly slept due to the continuous noise of homeless drunks directly opposite my room.

I cannot believe these reviews! I was booked on a tour which used Le Due Fontane and having read these reviews was greatly concerned. I called the tour company and voiced my concern. They assured me that there was nothing to be concerned about.THEY WERE RIGHT!! This little hotel was well located,had clean rooms,NO ODORS,NO NOISE, NO DRUNKS or ADDICTS!!! It did have the most helpful and considerate staff.Claudio was a godsend when I discovered I had been robbed.(Nowhere near the hotel) He called the police for me and then drove me to the police station. The snack bar in the hotel was so convenient because you could buy a sandwich or cappuccino and sit at one of the tables outside.It was like coming home after a long day. We sat out there in the evening talking until 11 or 11:30 at night feeling safe and secure.Breakfast was more then adequate,but the best part was that I could order a cappuccino which I prefer to Italian type morning coffee. I led a group of 8 friends and family and they all agreed with me.

I have just returned from a stay of 4 nights at the Due Fontane and couldn't be more pleased. I lived in Florence for three years and stayed at the hotel with a group. The location is spectacular, within 15 minutes of everything. As stated, there is a crowd of unsavories lurking across the street until early in the morning. They were not pleasant to look at, but totally harmless. I was in and out at all hours and they never even gave me a glance. The selling point of the hotel however is the staff. They went out of their way to be gracious, welcoming and friendly, which if you know Florence is not easily had. They more than made up for the druggies across the street.

When we asked the desk ckerk if their was something he could do about this he said nothing and did noting to correct this problem.

As a previous reviewer mentioned, the septic system released a foul odor into several rooms (we were on a tour and I confirmed this). The bathrooms in general were the least desirable part of the hotel. Ours was lit only by a small fluorescent light over the mirror, and the shower was like that on a boat--if you didn't draw the curtain, you could sit on the toilet and bathe! While there was a grab bar in the shower, the soap dish was way too high for someone who needs to sit on a stool while bathing (as my mom needs to do). The rest of our room was gorgeous, though, with terrazzo floors and beautiful fabrics. If we leaned out the window, we could see Giotto's campanile. There was, indeed, a lot of noise outside at night, but hearing Florentines living their lives was kind of a kick. We found most of the staff to be helpful and really kind, as my mother injured her knee on the way to Florence and had to be helped on and off the bus. The gentlemen who worked at the hotel were right there to help. One kind front desk man refused to accept a tip, even after arranging for a doctor to come to our room. They even bent the no food in the rooms rules and let me bring my mom coffee, food, etc. If it weren't for the odd and odorous bathrooms, I'd stay here again in a heartbeat.", "Date": "Apr 11, 2004", "ReviewID": "UR985460995", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "NativeCalGal"}, {"Content": "good location but has flaws Recently returned from a stay at Le Due Fontane. The hotel is across a piazza from the Accademia and a few blocks from the Duomo, which is its main selling point. It also has free internet in the lobby which is convenient for travelers. However, the staff was very unfriendly, the rooms were very dark and more than once the odor of raw sewage permeated the building. The piazza it faces is also somewhat questionable, with a fair amount of shady characters lurking about. They never bothered us, but some people might feel uncomfortable walking there at night.

However, the hotel's location isn't a fatal flaw since Florence is such a compact  walkable city. We stayed at Le Due Fontane for 2 nights in late September 2003. We moved to another hotel for the remainder of our stay in Florence because there were a group of drunk men on the street below who were screaming  hollering from about 1AM to 4AM. The hotel staff told us that it wasn't their problem - they could not control what goes on outside the hotel. After additional discussion, the night manager informed us that the drunks have been partying outside the hotel almost every night for the past 2+ years. The 2 rooms we considered on what was a dark, dirty courtyard smelled musty and were inferior to the rooms on the hotel's perimeter.
