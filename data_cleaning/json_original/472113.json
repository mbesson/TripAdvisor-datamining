The Hotel has some rooms that have been renovated and others that are in need. Ask for a room that has seen recent renovation-the second floor would be your best bet. The house is Victorian in origin but has seen additions that make it a clash of recent-modern vs. old victorian. The breakfast in the morning offers several hot and cold items that are suitable to start you day with. Coffee--find a Tim Hortons or Starbucks. The location is great for us as we always visit the Distillary district where the Christmas Festival is held each December--several blocks away but a direct route from the hotel. The area is safe but not in the heart of the action--try the Bond Place off Dundas if you want the Times Square-like lights and action. The Selby is just a few blocks off Younge but several more till you get to the shopping if that is what you seek. Basically, I rate this average across the boards. Good enough for the price and location. If you want better downtown walking action or to be pampered--stay somewhere else. If you go out front door, take a right and your next right all the way to Younge-cross the street to the falafel shop and you will find one of the best falafel sandwiches in town.", "Date": "March 14, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Canada", "Title": "\u201cGreat buy for the price!\u201d", "Author": "Cancuk12", "ReviewID": "UR124203890", "Content": "We picked this place through Expedia because we liked the whole converted 1800s mansion feel of the place.

They also offer a complimentary breakfast every morning, a public desktop PC with printer and on-site laundry. The room itself was very clean and modern, with a very nice bathroom (complete with walk-in shower), a mounted flat screen TV and a fairly strong WiFi signal. Apparently the hotel had undergone upgrading in some areas and the quality of the rooms varies, so if that's the case we lucked out. The location is pretty awesome, we were close to pretty much everything. The Eaton Centre, Cineplex Odeon, Hall of Fame etc are all within a $10 cab ride or 10-20 minute walk. There were restaurants, shopping, a grocery store, drug store, convenience stores and a Tim's within two minutes.

Ratings provided are based on the renovated rooms. TIP - ring when booking or before you arrive to ensure you get allocated a room on the upper floors (above first floor) in the upgraded section - or else give the place a complete miss. We booked online through one of the common hotel booking sites for a five night stay, and read previous tripadvisor reviews (and unfortunately missed comments about old vs new rooms) but did note there were some rooms in the basement with no windows and so requested an upper floor room in our booking request. It was unclear whether our request was overlooked or unable to be met and we were issued a room key on check-in for a basement level room (first floor rooms are in the basement), and so requested a change to an upper floor room, which was met. The room we stayed in for the first two nights was on the fourth floor, in the old section. I'm generally okay with staying in older, less fancy hotels providing the nightly rate refelcts that. This was probably one of the least value for money rooms I've ever stayed in, in years of travel for business and pleasure. Hemmingway apparently once stayed here and whilst this might be romantic and quirky history, unfortunately it doesn't now make for a good value or a comfortable stay. The bathroom was reasonable (probably a 1980's refurb?) with shower pressure a little weak. The room was dark, with older-style furniture and linen. The floor in our room had such a lean on one side that it was actually awkward doing work at the desk. Coffee machine in-room. I requested a room change to a newer room later in our first day that was unable to be accommodated. We were curtly informed we'd booked a queen room, and that was what we'd received. Unfortunately we had two nights of very interrupted sleep due to a noisy elevator and pretty thin walls (and we mostly sleep with earplugs). After doing some receptionist-shopping on the second day, our request of changing to a newer room was able to be accommodated and was much appreciated. Our change to a newer room was like moving hotels. The newer room was larger, almost soundproof, warmer and tastefully decorated. A large leather bedhead, nice linen, a very comfortable bed (pillows still a little on the lumpy, flat-pancake scale) and a strong, hot shower. Free wifi was much stronger in the new section also. Breakfast is served in the front rooms of the old part of the hotel, and was included in the price. It's available from 7 until 10 (I think), and is a standard continental style. A subway station (Sherbourne) is almost diagonally across the road from the Hotel, and we found it easy to get from the Central VIA train station (one changeover). Subway costs around $3 per person, per trip (transfers included). Cheaper to buy multiple tokens (10 for $25). The subway makes for easy access to various tourist places around Toronto. Plenty of fast food outlets, coffee shops and convenience stores nearby. Parking is available at the front of the hotel in open-air bays for $17 a night. The fire alarm went off during our stay and was attended by three engines and a support vehicle. We weren't evacuated however it might be useful for management to review evacuation procedures. We spoke with the fireman to clarify safety concerns. The older-style lift broke down for the last three days of our stay however there are several sets of stairs in the building. A drink and ice machine are available in the basement, as well as a convenient guest laundry on the ground floor for a small fee. Staff helpfulness/friendliness was dependent on the individual. One did not endear himself to us by suggesting that the old and new rooms were of the same standard, and giving us the impression he resented us moving.

Location is great (quiet and a half-block from Sherbourne subway) and there is onsite parking. The reception area is a good renovation of the Victorian high-ceilinged parlor, but the renovation doesn't reach the hotel hallways or (apparently) a number of the rooms or the elevator. The worst problem is the clinging musty/sour smell everywhere but the reception area and breakfast room. I was upgraded to a suite, which was not a worthwhile bonus. The room was vast, but in the old part of the hotel and seriously neglected (the smell I mentioned above, poor quality plaster repairs, badly installed 80s vinyl hotel wallpaper, ugly mismatched curtains). Likely to be cold in winter (there were two baseboard heaters, but not controllable by the guest, who could only get heat from the window A/C unit). No attention to detail by housekeeping: the room was mostly clean, but vacuuming did not reach baseboards, some lights were not working, refrigerator and microwave were plugged into a defective adapter and not getting power, so I had to haul them away from the wall to correct the problem. Internet access instructions incorrect (they're in a loose-leaf binder, so why not change them?). Breakfast was great considering it was free, but served on disposable everything (plates, cups, utensils). I found the staff friendly, but I get the impression that the management has given up on the place, so I did not report the problems in my room except on the comment card when I left. Overall, fair value for money, but if you spend more than the minimum amount of time in the hallways (and perhaps your room if it is like mine) the musty smell will drive you crazy. With some investment of time and cash, this could be an appealing hotel (not a concrete box that looked like all the others), but at the moment it's just a place to sleep and shower, definitely not linger in.", "Date": "October 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ontario, California", "Title": "\u201cBad Experience\u201d", "Author": "mntcrst", "ReviewID": "UR119279099", "Content": "Take care of your fingers when opening the elavator gate,The vicinity of the hotel is not safe..We're trav'ling from california to visit our friends in toronto and stay in the hotel for one night and a night to remember, somebody broke-in to our car for shopping only to get $100 navigator and some kids cloths...the cost for repair is $850 for window glass...The management of the hotel seems ready for that situition and they have number for auto glass repair to offer you....BEWARE OF THIS HOTEL...", "Date": "October 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGood value for the money.

Although told that I was actually given a room on the first floor, the room was actually in the basement. The front desk will try (unsuccessfully) to convince you otherwise. The alarm bells sounded off when I passed what appeared to be a cluster of dirty, abandoned airconditioning units on the way to my room. Along another wall, I saw some suspicious looking cartons scattered on the floor. I had no idea what they were doing there, but since we were in the basement, maybe that's where they store things like that. My room was unattractive and cramped. It had a peculiar odour. The carpet was dirty. My sock got stuck to something sticky on the carpet. The bathroom looked old and in need of some serious upgrading or renovating. When I complained at the front desk, I was told there weren't any other rooms available but that I could switch to another room the next day. I did exactly that, but spend a sleepless night in the basement due to the creepiness of the room and the light penetrating the room from the hallway. The hallway was noisy until late. The next morning, I left my luggage at the front desk and looked forward to getting a new room. An employee at the front desk was pleasant and stored my luggage. Later in the day, I was given a beautiful room on the 4th floor in a newly revovated section where I spent a comfortable night. It was clean, spacious, had a flat screen tv attached to a wall opposite the bed which had excellent reception of all cable channels. I point this out because the room in the basement had and old tv with lousy reception. Despite the beautiful modern bathroom, the shower did not appear to have any hot water. The sink had plenty of hot water, though. And despite my dissatifaction with the basement room, the hotel employees never apologized for the misrable night I spent in the basement nor did they give me a refund for the first night which I would have appreciated.

The hotel clerk was very nice and verified that I could check out at 3pm with NO extra charges -this was in print: late check out, no charge. I signed their agreement and asked for a copy. The clerk said that they do not give out copies. If I could go back in time, I would have photographed this statement and taken the name of the clerk. The next day, I received a phone call from the front desk (another clerk) stating that I had to \"please check out at 11 am.\" When I arrived at the front desk and explained the arrangement, I was told that the clerk from the night before gave me misinformation, that he did not know better, that he would never make such an arrangement, that they have to get in touch with him to verify this. Then I was told by the new clerk that he could not allow me to stay until 3pm because they could \"sell the room for more and that would be smart business from a business man's point of view\" I could not believe what I was hearing. When I said that I would report this to the head office, he told me that that would be the best thing to do in this situation since he could not do anything. Ironically, in their hotel book, it clearly states that guests should go to the front desk to have all their problems resolved. The front desk clerk told me that the manager was not on site. I stated that I was promised over the phone and in last night's statement that they printed -- I could stay until 3pm no charge. They never gave me a copy of the agreement that they typed up the night before -they only filed it away. When they checked their records, they stated that they had no such arrangement in place, but they refused to let me see the paper or give me a copy. Shockingly, I was yelled at in a very hostile manner. I am a visitor and who needs to go about my business and the last thing I need is this type of service. Their behaviour caught me off guard. I told the front desk person that it was wrong to not honour their arrangement if their rationale is selling the room to make more money - I don't mind paying extra if that I was I agreed to and if that is what I was informed of in the first place. But instead he yelled at me and told me my only option was to pay if I want the extra hours. I checked out. There's no reason for this type of treatment. You can't manipulate the agreement and then intimidate your guests to pay extra. I didn't know whether to call the cops or not. Wherever I go from now, I will always request a copy of their statement that they make guest sign. And if they refuse, I'll take a picture of the statement. If my signature goes on a piece of paper, I have a right to get a copy and a right to see the paper. End of story. Also, later that week, I was double-charged for the room. When I called my credit card company, they flagged the extra charge as an unrecognized amount. When I called the hotel, they told me that was not a real charge and that I should not worry about it, that it would disappear. I told them what my credit card company told me and that I would like this resolved.

The website is a complete misrepresentation of what the hotel is really like. The rooms are small, dingy, inefficiently heated. There is no heating or cooling unit in the bathroom. Early APril is abad time of year to not have heat after your shower. My appointments consisted of a peeling windowsill, a patched up (but not painted) wall, chairs with cigarette burns in them, and a construction sit for a view. Being a New Yorker, the construction didn't bother me much. The strange odors, and attitude of the management that this is \"an old hotel\" when I complained about a lack of cleanliness in my room was not helpful. To his credit, he did make it right, But I had to make him see what I was talking about! As for this being an old hotel, I have been in many in NY that are about as old, and maintained to a very high standard. Which clearly this isn't and won't be with such a rather boneheaded attitude! This place could have lots of potential if lovingly restored. It now reminds me of my college dorms before they were refurbished. Get the idea? Too bad because some parts have enormous ceilings, tin panels, stained glass, wide staircases..the makings of a lovely place in the hands of a person dedicated to customer service and not greed. The ugly: Ah yes. The old let's charge the credit card for bogus incidentals trick. I should have realized that when they took a $50 \"deposit\" they swore would be refunded upon my departure.It wasn't . They charged me an extra 100 (for a total of 150 CAD) for a \"damaged bedspread\". They assert some inky stuff got on it. It could well have--I was packing and in a hurry but geez!!! Gimme a break!!! And of course, I was told it would be 150 bucks to replace an old, dingy, scratchy bedcover made of cheap, shiny fabric that felt like fiberglass.

We had to park across the street in the public parking where you had to repay every morning and evening so you couldn't just pay for a whole 24 hour period. The exchange rate at the hotel was poor so it ended up costing us a lot to park across the street. We had to wake up at 7am to buy a new parking pass each day. The second day we were there I asked if there was any parking available (there is limited parking at the hotel, first come first serve). She got irritated with me for asking and then told me she \"didn't think there was any\" but refused to look. In other words we ended up paying for parking the entire time we were there. The \"continental breakfast\" consists of eggos and bad bagels. Our TV remote barely worked until one day we came back from the day out and the batteries were no longer in it. Also you should be aware that there are a great many rooms in the basement. There are only a few stories so it is likely you will be put in the basement where we were.

The hotel ended up costing $72/night (Canadian). The location is great for leisure travelers to Toronto. I used to live in the city so I know that the price is pretty decent for being downtown. The parking at the time of my stay was $13+tax per night. If you want to get up early and move your car by 7am there is a lot across the street that's a flat rate of $6/night from 6pm-7am. The lot seemed safe enough, and there was nothing about the area that made me feel uneasy being a lone female traveler. The parking lot at the hotel is small, I estimate about 25 spaces that are on a first come first serve basis. It's also cramped so large vehicles would be difficult to manouever. If you don't have a car, the area is actually more convienient as the entrance to the Sherbourne subway station is right across the street from the hotel. Also, the hotel is about 2 blocks from Yonge & Bloor--this is a busy area with lots of restaurants, bars, pubs, and shops. That area of Yonge is pretty busy until about 3:30 am on the week-ends. Also a pretty safe area to walk in at night; however, it's downtown in a big city, so I would advise being cautious just as a general rule. The hotel is an easy walk (about 20 min.) to the Royal Ontario Museum (the ROM). Within an hour or less of walking you can also walk to the Eaton Centre or the theatre district, so a cab ride wouldn't be too much. Currently there's a lot of roadwork going on in the area so getting around by car is VERY slow and the Don Valley Parkway (highway that runs north/south and connects to the 401) closes a lot on the week-ends for construction--so it makes traveling by vehicle in and out of downtown sow and tedious unless your more familiar with the area and are comfortable taking residential roads. The hotel itself is quite old. It was originally built in the 1870's as a private home and then eventually converted into a hotel. Due to it's age there are quirks and things that go along with that; like the very small elevator that holds 5 people and has the old-school type door that opens like a regular door and has a sliding cage you have to push aside to get in--the doors don't open automatically. The continental breakfast included in the room price is OK to get you started; it has coffee/juices, toast, bagels, yogurt, cereal, frozen waffles (like Eggo's), and hard boiled eggs. Breakfast seems to be served from 7am-10am on the week-ends. I find that the area of the hotel is very quite for being right downtown. You don't really hear any street noise. The room I was in was small. It had a small desk, a large sliding door closet with a double mirror on it, 1 double bed, a TV (27\" I think), and a air conditioner/heating unit. The bathroom had a shelf above the toilet, a pedistal sink, and only a stand-up shower (no bath tub). I did not like the shower curtain as it was light cloth and tended to be sucked into the shower and touches you, which I find kind of gross. The furnishings and carpeting are kind of old and have that worn-in look. The room in general was clean enough, there was a couple stray hairs in the bathroom and the back of the TV and the heating/cooling unit was dusty. The building also used to be a girls school and the rooms are kind or dormitory-style, rather than what you would expect at a Days Inn or something. There was a computer in the lobby that seemed to have internet and appeared to be available for anyone's use, though I didn't use it myself. I didn't have much interaction with the staff, as I didn't have any problems or need to ask any questions so I'm not sure how helpfull they are. The over-all look of the hotel is also kind of worn. As it is an old building there are cracks and parts that are uneven, and creaks; but it's not horrible. I would recommend the place more for travelers without little children (say under the age of 10). There seemed to be a lot of 20-somethings staying there--probably because of it's low cost, and proximity to night-life. I'm not sure that I would call it a 3-star hotel, but for the price and the area it's in I thought that it was decent. I don't have any significant complaints. Oh, there are raccoons in the area--especially the parking lot. They don't seem dangerous, but they can startle you. In all, the hotel is OK. I recommend it if you want to stay somewhere different that's not a cookie-cutter Holiday Inn. I don't think I'd like to stay there longer than 3 or 4 nights, but I think it's pretty good for a week-end stay.", "Date": "April 26, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cSubterrenean experience\u201d", "Author": "NYMotherFussers", "ReviewID": "UR26923056", "Content": "We stayed at this hotel for five nights in fall 2005, during the Toronto International Film Fest.

We did not however find the staff helpful as my husband asked if he could use the microwave and was told by a male staff at the front desk that they didn't have a working microwave (?!?!). We had also been promised a microwave and fridge in our room when we booked. However when we checked in they weren't in the room and were out of each. Should they get one for us we were going to be charged $10 each. The breakfast was adequate but not very good. I would suggest they leave hard boiled eggs in the shell so they could stay warmer, cover the bread and stop using stale croissants. The juice and cereals are good. Can't beat this hotel for area as it's across the street from the Bloor/Sherbourne subway line and the Sherbourne bus runs right in front of the hotel.

Booked directly through the hotel website for a queen room on a higher floor and such was honored upon arrival at the hotel. The hotel itself is an old mansion that has been converted into a hotel and an addition was added as well to enlarge the space for the hotel. The common areas of the hotel are well kept up but are also decorated in an antique type style which I believe adds to the charm of the hotel. The lobby is tastefull decorated in antique furniture and draperies and is very cozy if you want to just sit and relax at any time. The hotel also provides a guest computor with free internet access 24/7 which is also placed in the lobby. My room was small (by normal standards) but extremely clean and cozy. In addition to the queen bed, there was an armiore with a TV, a writing desk, a small fridge and microwave, and coffee maker. The bathroom provided ample towels and toiletries which were replentished daily if needed. The room also had a walk in closet, which I think was almost the size of the bathroom and provided more than plenty of room to store your luggage and any clothing you wished to hang up or put on the provided shelving. The hotel also provided a complimentary breakfast in their breakfast room each morning. **There have been previous reviews about the content, etc of the breakfast, however, I have to say, I thought it was great, and I AM fussy about this sort of thing. The room was nicely set up; there were several kinds of both hot and cold cereal, muffins, breads, bagels pastries, hardboiled eggs, sausage patties, several kinds of juices and yogurt, and many kinds of tea, in addition to regular coffee, provided with REAL cream and sugar. It was more than sufficient to start the day. There were also staff present in the breakfast room restocking items as they ran low. The location of the hotel itself is just off Bloor Street in what I would describe as an older part of downtown Toronto but the area had alot to offer in terms of restaurants, local pubs, and the subway about a block down the street to get you anywhere in Toronto you wanted to go. Overall, if you're looking for a clean, quiet, and well priced hotel, this is it. I'm not sure where the negative reviews come from, but my stay here was exceptionally positive. The staff there are extremely helpful and accomodate all of your requests and questions without any hesitation. I've also noticed that despite the negative reviews, no one ever puts any pictures on here to portray the accuracy of their complaints, so have decided to put some on that will portray the good the hotel has to offer.

I am sitting in a very elegant lobby full of antiques, hearing numerous foreign languages, using the complementary wireless from my laptop. There is a \"business center\" in the lobby: a computer and printer free to be used by guest. It is situated on a handsome antique desk. I purchased my two night stay from the WCNY public broadcast fundraiser in January 2007. This stay is a great contrast to our usual casino resort stays... and we like it. We are fortunate to have a room in the mansion section of the hotel. I would guess there are 10 or 15 rooms in the mansion. I had requested a King bed, but was offered a queen in the mansion. I jumped to take it. The room is small but that is no problem. The bathroom is huge and appears to have been recently renovated. I always look for elements to incorporate in my home renovations. In this bathroom, I like the silver and gold water fixtures. Also, the tile work is very nicely designed and installed. The closet is a riot. It is big and appears unchanged for 100+ years. I told my husband, \"this closet is as big as the bathroom I had in Hotel City in Netherlands last year.\" Whatever has been written negative about the complimentary breakfast is not current. My husband and I carried our room coffee mugs to the breakfast after reading that the foam cups were not good. But, the disposable coffee cups were a nice type. Also, someone had reported at this site or another review site that they did not give real cream with the coffee. We purchased milk at a market nearby for the coffee, but there was nice cream at the breakfast buffet. The buffet included: croissant, bagels, four cereals including Mueslix, apples, hard boiled eggs, mini yogurts, juices, apples, jams, peanut butter, honey, and the list goes on. It was a very nice offering and a pleasantly clean little dining room. Upon arrival, everyone at the front desk worked to help us out. There was an issue of the value of our package, and it was handled well. The parking arrangement was to our liking. We were assigned the spot we had parked it. We were given a key to view the \"Hemingway room\". This was what attracted us to this hotel. We are great fans of Ernest Hemingway's writing. (In 1976 I followed his path in Southern Spain, going to places he had visited, talking to people who had served him - mostly bartenders.). Anyway, it has been 30+ years since being on the Hemingway path and was great to see his room: beautiful antique furniture, many windows looking down on the street, a windowed \"porch\" room with a desk. We imagined him writing here for the Toronto Star. We did not get a good look at the bathroom, but it didn't look as modern as the renovation in our room. I believe the value of our room is $149 per night. I would say it is a fair price. If you are accustomed to the modern and large hotel room, this might be a shock. In the words of my husband, \"I would have never chosen this hotel because I am a hotel snob.\" He is a frequent business and casino resort traveler. But, he too is greatly enjoying this hotel experience. Thank you to the Toronto Clarion and Haroon Latif for your donation to the Arts in Central New York.

Minuses: This place is very far from the cool Queen and College Streets, Hipster Kensington Market or awesome Chinatown. You have to walk a lot to get there, or take other means of transportation. The front desk people do have an attitude problem, let me expand below. When I checked in, I told the front desk guy that my print out of the reservation said smoker room, but I had selected non-smoker. He rolled his eyes and with an accusatory tone he said \u00e2\u20ac\ufffdOhh, it is smoker because you chose smoker\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Why does he have to be argumentative when we both know what the outcome of things will be, he will just change the rooms, right? In a really class A service hotel, the way they do it is like this \u00e2\u20ac\ufffdIt\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s okay, I can change it\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd A hotel with great customer service wants the guest to feel taken care of, not belittlle or make them feel stupid. Terrible attitude. Then at checked out there is sign in the front office that says \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We support fair exchange\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and has the quote of the exchange rate that was very reasonable. I want to pay in cash with my Canadian dollars when I noticed that I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have enough. My boyfriend decides to get rid of his American cash (he brought a lot) and pay the bill pointing at the sign. The front desk guy is following all our conversation. After my boyfriend paid for the bill in US$, and the guy gives us our receipt and the left over change he says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Oh, by the way that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an old rate, we haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t changed in a while\" This is of course after he has charged us and given us the crappiest exchange rate.

In short, we loved our stay at the clarion and we truly recomment it.", "Date": "August 5, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ottawa Canada", "Title": "\u201cHelpful Front Desk\u201d", "Author": "catelpa", "ReviewID": "UR3730521", "Content": "We wanted to try the Clarion Selby because we had lived across the street in 1980 when \"The Selby\" was a run-down tavern. We moved away from Toronto, but noticed during our return visits recently that this area of Toronto, and especially \"The Selby\" had undergone an extreme transformation for the better ... so we booked our stay at the Clarion Selby to check it out. On checking in, the desk attendant was unable to find any indication of our reservation but, non-plussed, proceeded to arrange for us to stay in one of larger suites at the same rate. The room was absolutely fantastic .... meanwhile, the front desk had cleared up the kerfuffle with our reservation. We had a wonderful stay at \"The Selby\" and recommend it to anyone who does not feel obligated to blow $200 to $300 ( or more !!) per night for a safe, clean place to sleep while staying in downtown Toronto. Park your car in the lot (only $13 per night) and walk, take the tube, or taxi anywhere you feel the urge go.", "Date": "August 2, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ontario, Canada", "Title": "\u201cUnusual & Nice\u201d", "Author": "dbakerca", "ReviewID": "UR3508753", "Content": "I stayed in this hotel on May 25 & 26, 2005. I chose it as I am a member of the ChoiceClub plan and this was the closest Choice Hotel to where I was attending business meetings. The location of this hotel is very good - only one block south of Bloor Street and a ten minute walk from Yonge Street. The pros - 1. Clean, quiet and comfortable; 2. Very friendly and accomodating staff; 3. Unique nature as it is a historically designated building (whle not seeming too old inside); 4. Location in a residential / boutique area; 5. Value - My room was $108 per night including a good continential breakfast. The two cons - 1. The breakfast room itself. First, it is not the room on the main floor marked \"Breakfast Room\". The room I eventually found was in the basement and was not very appealling; 2. The parking - There are not many parking spaces at this hotel and they have been arranged rather higgily-piggily around the building. This made for some tight maneuvering even with a small car. Would I stay here again? Yes, the five pros listed well outweighed the two cons. If you are not a hotel snob, this hotel will do just fine.", "Date": "May 29, 2005"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Clarion Hotel & Suites Selby", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g155019-d472113-Reviews-Clarion_Hotel_Suites_Selby-Toronto_Ontario.html", "Price": "$97 - $182*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">592 Sherbourne Street</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Toronto</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">Ontario</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">M4X 1L4 </span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Canada</span> (Formerly Howard Johnson)</span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "472113", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/79/21/792183d1d62ae8d1815bdbc92931d34b4large.jpg"}}
