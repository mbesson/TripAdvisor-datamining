NO. We booked a \"superior room with Queen bed\" nearly four weeks in advance. We chose this hotel because it claimed to have parking. They emailed to confirm the booking and to say parking was nearby in car park 25\u20ac daily. Where do I start, it is NOT romantic. The desk woman barely looked at us as she reviewed our booking and handed the key over. Our room had two 2'6\" singled pushed together and just about room to walk around it (room44). We went straight back down to say we had booked a superieur room with a Queen bed - she replied it was a superieur room.Hmm? We were given another room which was the same but had an additional area with a single bed also (room 52). The reviews are right - there is absolutely NO sound proofing - you will hear everything and the smell of smoke does indeed fill your room through the ceiling vents if you have smokers above you. Upstairs checked out at 8.30 am on Sunday having clomped aorund for at least an hour. Ahhh we thought, sleep. NO. The cleaner arrived upstairs to hoover and another in the room opposite - both VERY NOISY. The room was cold, barren, no frills, but it was clean. Great location but dont expect to see it out the windows. Construction and high buildings around mean you dont see anything really. There is car parking nearby but not as close as would be nice. In summary - great hotel if you are deaf, single and a chain smoker. miss", "Date": "October 19, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Jackson Heights, New York", "Title": "\u201cNice, simple, clean stay\u201d", "Author": "rosefarmer", "ReviewID": "UR30449640", "Content": "Nice little hotel.

I had left them by the bed only to find that house keeping had come into our room and my sunglasses were GONE!

We talked to the owner also and she was so RUDE that she threatened to call the police for false accusations and said she was taking the house keepers side beacuse she knows her for 20 years.

We arrived by train from Cologne, Germany and took a short metro trip to the HOTEL DU CONTINENT in the 1st district, one block from the Jardin des Tuileries. The hotel was perfectly located in the city center and modestly priced as well. Even though there were a few mishaps (our train from Cologne had some \"technical difficulties\", as did our hotel elevator), we made sure to hit the major Parisian monuments: the Louvre, the Arc de Triomphe, strolling the Champs Elysees, the Hotel National des Invalides, a Seine river tour, the Eiffel Tower, Notre Dame, the Basilique du Sacre Coeur, and the Moulin Rouge to name a few. We figured we must have walked about 10 miles each day we were there, so THANK GOODNESS we were able to keep our strength up with croissants and crepes!

The location of the hotel is fantastic we couldn`t believe it.. The staff were very friendly and eager to help if they could. the Room was a fine size very clean and brightly decorated. The area itself was a bit pricey but we found a lovely Pub just a stone throw from the Hotel called Carrs and it served lovely food and drink that was very affordable compared to a few other places we`d been.

First of all, the hotel is a great location for sightseeing in Paris. You are in the 1st district, which is walking distance to the Louvre, the Tuillieres, etc. - and you are right near the Siene, making it easy to pop right over the bridge to the Left Bank. We walked everwhere - to Sacred Heart, Galleries Lafayette - we rarely took cabs (only when super shopped-out) and even the Metro was easy from the hotel. The neighborhood of the hotel is pretty cute, too, lots of boutiques in the area, and lots of good shopping only a block away on Rue du Honore. As for the hotel itself, it is very small. there are only six floors and the elevator (also small!) only goes to the 5th floor, so you will need to walk up a small flight of stairs to get to the 6th floor, which is where we stayed. there were only four rooms on the 6th floor, and maybe 6-8 rooms on the other floors We had a Standard room, and it was quite small. Mercifully we weren't there much, because if so it would have been pretty tight. I would recommend getting a Superior-sized room just to have a little more space. Generally speaking the room was clean and the bathroom was pretty clean. housekeeping came in each day and left fresh towels, which was nice, not all hotels do that without you specifically requesting them to do so. Water was hot, and the shower water pressure was good. The hotel was recently renovated so the bathroom fixtures are pretty modern. Note: there were no face towels in the room, only hand towels and bath towels. this is pretty common in Europe, so if you want a face towel you might want to bring your own. There is a mini bar in the room and a small desk. the TV has a random smattering of channels, but there is CNN and that's what we found ourselves watching for the most part. TRUE: the walls are paper thin - maybe thinner than paper.... You will pretty much hear the comings and goings of your neighbors, so be prepared for that. The first couple of days were annoying because clearly we were not on the same schedule as our floormates but then it got better but that's because i'm assuming they checked out. Another thing: there are no in-room safes. they have a safe downstairs and you can store your items there, but you can only access the safe from 8am to 8pm. if you like your things in your room in your own safe, this is not the hotel for you. They do have a converter which converts the plug and the electric current, you just have to request it at the front desk (also from 8am-8pm). We paid 107 euro per night (a \"Spring\" deal that we got by seeing it on their website and then calling them directly), which was a good rate, i'm not sure i'd pay too much more for it. We're super-picky about hotels but generally speaking i think most would be happy with it. But again, if you are there to see Paris and not the walls of your room, then the location is perfect.", "Date": "June 6, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGreat stay!\u201d", "Author": "j'adoreparis", "ReviewID": "UR3483245", "Content": "This hotel offers clean, affordable accommodations in a great location.

C'est magnifique! The Hotel du Continent has it all -- an unbeatable location, clean (and, by Paris standards, sizable) rooms, and rates that are incredibly affordable in the 1st arrondissement. The hotel is on a quiet side street just off the rue de Rivoli, the street that leads to the Tuilieries and the Louvre Museum. Within a five or six block radius, you have most of the major Right Bank sites, including the following: the Louvre (3 blocks), the Tuilieries (1 block), Place de Concorde (1 block), Place Vendome (1 block), and the Church of La Madeleine (4 blocks). The Marais is roughly 10 blocks away, which we walked. We started every day there with hot chocolate and pasteries at Angelina's -- a must, just 2 blocks from the hotel -- and walked to the Louvre through the Tuileries. For more distant sites on the Right Bank, such as the Basilica of Sacre Coeur and Monmartre generally, there are two subway stations within 2 blocks of the hotel (Concorde and Tuilieries) and there's a taxi stand at the Place Vendome (1 block away). Despite all this in such close proximity to the hotel, the hotel is very quiet, without even a hint that you're smack dab in the middle of a crowded city. The hotel staff were helpful with directions and reservations, and spoke good English. Unlike others staying elsewhere in Paris, our belongings were completely secure while we were away. You can't go wrong with the Hotel du Continent. Unless the rates go up dramatically, we'll definitely be back!
