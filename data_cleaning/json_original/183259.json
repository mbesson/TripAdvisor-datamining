I got to the hotel mid afternoon, there were a large group of teenagers everywhere in front of the building and in the lobby, I checked into my hotel room, upon entering the hotel room I heard a toilet flush, I thought to myself, wow, very thin walls, then the bathroom door opens and out walks a housekeeper, she giggles and says oh I forgot to put something in there... and darts out the door, I go in and check the washroom, she had clearly used the washroom. I was tired so I went to bed early, at approx 1230am there was yelling and screaming going on in the hallway, kids partying this went on until about 6-7am, I complained to the front desk they moved me to a different room, I asked for compensation, the guy at the desk told me he would ask a supervisor, and call me, he never called back at 430am I was again awakend by screaming and yelling again, I checked out the following day, complained to the front desk, they told me because I booked on Hotels.com that they could not refund me my money, thankfully I had eaten at the restaurant, so I had them eat that bill which was 93.00 but two nights of no sleep, I should have gotten a full refund. The hotel had security, but that was just so they could argue with the teenagers in the hallway, rather then kick them out so the other guests could enjoy their stay, which I found rediculous. I ate in the restaurant, both nights I had the chef's special, Ceaser salad was amazing, however the main course, wasnt a thrill, the rice and the vegetables were perfectly cooked, but the pork it was easy to taste that it was left overs and you could tell it was tough. The following night, I had Ceaser salad and lasagna, the ceaser this night was lame, hardly any dressing on it, I would have asked for some but the servers were to busy arguing with each other that I never botherd,, the lasagna was such a small portion that I ended up leaving hungry. Breakfast was good on both days, but you can tell that consistancy is an issue in this restaurant, not to mention that there was only 3 tables in the restaurant, and I counted 7 servers standing around... way to go with putting your labour cost through the roof....now I know why they charge 25 bucks a plate... I will not return to this location ever again, and will not recommend it to anyone, I have stayed at several hotels, and I guarantee you this one was by far the WORST!!!", "Date": "March 16, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto", "Title": "\u201ccheap hotel\u201d", "Author": "FuntravellersToronto", "ReviewID": "UR126010416", "Content": "We stayed one night at this hotel.

Slightly north of Old Montreal, it was an easy walk to anywhere near the Port, also only a couple of blocks from Starbucks and a 24-hour Tim Hortons. I found the general atmosphere good but not extraordinary. The internet is wireless, and was ok when it worked, but several times it dropped out on me. I would have to go through the log-in procedure again. It was not up to the task of Skype with video. There is a desk with electrical outlets and enough room for all your stuff. However, the flat panel TV is mounted on a stalk right above the desk. So you can't watch TV and work at the same time without breaking your neck. Very bizarre, really. The air conditioning/heat is a standard motel window type. The fan is loud, so if you need a quiet room to sleep, you're out of luck.

This wasn't my first time in Montreal, so I picked the Lord Berri Hotel because of its great location. It's a couple of blocks from the main bus station, and is one block away from the busy Berri-UQAM Metro Station. Furthermore, bustling rue Ste. Catherine with its restaurants and bars is literally around the corner. The location is also close enough to Old Montreal, Centre Ville (downtown) and other main roads for those inclined to drive around town. The service is good. The welcome upon arrival was very pleasant and friendly. The staff was very helpful to me and my friends (who were not hotel guests) when we had to find a taxi one day very early in the morning. Our room, including the bathroom, was kept clean everyday. The free Wifi service in our room was a great bonus too. The only \"negative\" to this hotel is that it's pretty old - the furniture and wallpaper are dated - it seems that nothing's been changed in more than 25 years. Nevertheless, everything in the hotel seems to be in good working condition, so if aesthetics aren't a big deal to you, then this hotel is fine. For about US$100 a night on Labor Day weekend, this hotel was a reasonably good place to stay.

My girlfriend and I decided to plan a weekend trip to Montreal for a bit of shopping, cultural experience, and a to enjoy the night life. Booking under a week to the date, and on a busy summer weekend, as well as not having any experience in Montreal travel, I was quite worried looking for a reasonable place to stay. Browsing through many other hotels, b&b's, and apartments, I was quite nervous of book a place from many mixed reviews. Price was an issue, but we didnt want to go too cheap at the expense of quality. I settled on the Lord Berri because of a majority of good reviews, appealing website and photos, as well as there own underground parking garage. I highly recommend this hotel with the following key pieces of advice. - Get there early on the day of your reservation, even if your room is not ready, so as to secure a spot in their limited underground parking. It's price is similar to independent street level parking lots, but secure and gives you a piece of mind if you're like us and unfamiliar to the safety of areas within the city. - Book online through the hotel website as they often have deals and I managed to score a really nice room with a queen size bed for only $99. Some addititonal good points of this hotel is: - It's two steps off of St. Catherine street where most of the action is. - Ten/ fifteen minutes walk to major shopping/happening spots. - Right beside a Metro stop which by subway can take you anywhere. - A little quieter than staying a few blocks away on the busiest part of town. - I had read mixed reviews about the staff and rooms, however staff was very helpful and provided us with constant directions as well as restaurant ideas. Rooms were also excellent in condition and clean! - Grocery store, drugstore, liquor store, and coffee/book shops, all extremely close for last minute convenience or necessity. Other points: If you're looking for a hotel with other major frills, this might not be the best for you. The lobby is basic and hotel restaurant/bar/cafe was alway empty and quiet. But if you're only there for a short period of time and dont require any special facilities in your hotel, this place is perfect. My recommendation is for the discounted website specials, this hotel has amazing bang for it's buck. If I was going to pay the normal rate at close to 170, I might still choose this hotel, although I'd research around a bit more to see if I could get more for that price.

I didn't know much about the hotel, other than it was in a great location downtown, and had a restaurant attached to it. When I walked into the hotel, I felt like I was in some seedy motel that I would see in these old movies. The decor in the lobby appeared to be from a time before I was born. The desk clerk who checked me in, who was actually pretty friendly, indicated that my hotel room was paid for by my employer. She noted that there was 2 of us staying in the room (myself and another employee that I had yet to meet). She indicated that although the room was paid for, I had to leave a credit card or $500 cash to cover incidentals. The other guest would have to do the same when he/she arrived. I was really reluctant to give my credit card info, given that I was in a foreign city staying at some strange motel - who knows what would happen to my personal and credit card info? Seriously - when you walk into this place, you don't get a sense of poshness or security - one doesn't feel safe - very disconcerting actually. But she indicated the nearest bank machine was quite far away. So despite my serious reservations, eventually I gave in, and gave my credit card info, but made it absolutely clear that it was ONLY to be used to cover incidentals and nothing else. I signed the registration form, and off I went to my room. The room was OK. At least the water was hot. Again, the bedcovers and decor was from the 60s or 70s and the carpet looked like it hadn't been washed in decades. The locks on the door looked flimsy - really only a push button lock that can be jiggered with a credit card. I had to put a chair in front of the door. But I've seen worse. Restaurant food just OK - can walk one block east and one block north to the mall, and get early breakfast for a 1/3 of the price though. Check out time - I make sure I get a receipt - showing the room is paid in full, and that I didn't owe anything because no incidentals were charged. I figured, I'm pretty safe. 3 months later, I get a massive charge on my credit card for almost $1000. I call the hotel to get an explanation, and they tell me that the clerk who told me that the room was paid for told me the wrong thing, and that they had the right to charge me because they had my credit card \"on file\". They also had the right to charge only me, and not the other guest, because the room was under my name, presumably because I checked in first. Because I had signed the \"guest registration card\" (which didn't even have any credit card info on it), the credit card company refused to reverse the charge. When a hotel takes your credit card, and tells you that they agree to only hold that information for the purposes of paying for incidentals only, and then months later attempts to make some arbitrary charge on it at their own discretion, without any notice to you, knowing that you're not likely going to be there again to fight it, if you even happen to see it on your credit card bill... well, that's pretty SCUMMY. There is nothing that I can do to control what else they do with my credit card or personal information. The lodging themselves were already quite dodgy, and had I known what the lodgings were like, I would have stayed in a hostel instead. But this practice absolutely apalls me. STAY AWAY! STAY AWAY!

We all stayed at the Lord Berri for 3 nights and all had the same horrible experiance. Firstly, they make you feel as if you are there because of punishment rather than pleasure. The first thing you see on your desk is a list of rules and regulations (some of which are absolutely absurd). Along with fines for damages. Some of the rules include: No walking outside your room in your pajamas, no glass allowed, no eating food outside of the room / bar, doors must be closed at all times, and they keep going. Secondly we had a \"security\" guard tell us that it was a national law in Quebec that quiet hours start at 11. Yes, he was serious. When do they end? Who knows because he wasn't bright enough to divulge that information. Clearly a lie because clubs on the exact same street as the hotel are open until 3 am. But at the Lord Berri that is an offense for which you can get kicked out. Dumb rules yes, but do they actually enforce them? YES. There is a \"security\" guard on every floor and their sole purpose is to enforce these rules. You will be constantly invaded by one of these guards, and they will not reason with you. 9 times out of time if you try to reason all you will recieve is: \"ITS OVER!\" and a stern look. One guard actually tackled someone down in the lobby and gave him a fat lip before he profusely apologized. Bathrooms are clean, which is nice. But if you like hot water you'll be out of luck. When showering there is zero hot water and instead it is ice cold. I had to shower out of the sink with cups because the water was THAT cold. It was this cold for all 3 days, not just one. The TVs look like they were made in 1967 but we had an OK picture. One of the rooms in our group though had one that didn't work and the hotel did nothing. There are cleaning services, but if you are caught leaving a \"dirty\" room and dont pack up all garbage / used towels you are fined an absurd amount. We kept our room clean though. Lastly, here is the most repulsive issue I have ever seen and we could probably sue them over this. Throughout the trip our toilet would not flush. It was fixed though and apparently all was well. One of our friends come home from our New Year's Eve party around 2 am. They realized they left something in the room, and when they walk in our whole room is flooded because the toilet is pumping water into our room at a constant rate. Quickly they shut the toilet off, and remove the furniture from the room. They being attempting get atleast some of the water out. During this process the \"security\" guard walks up to them and has the nerve to yell at them for having the door open and a chair outside of the room. He did not want to hear what happened, and my friend finally got through the \"IT'S OVER\" (x's 100000) and once he realized what had happened maybe you'd expect an apology, or someone to help clean up the mess that their faulty toilet caused...nope not at the Lord Berri. They were left alone to handle it, and were told that someone would come in tomorrow. When all of the parties of that room arrived home to a flooded room / damaged personal property because of the water, surely we could stay in another room. We explained what happened at the desk (in a polite manner), and asked if we could stay in a different room for the night. The man at the desk laughed and said sorry that they could not help us, and said that we needed to speak to a manager who wasn't there but would be there in the morning. So 4 people had to sleep in a toilet water infested room, with no explanation at all. So after 3 hours of sleep Will (one of the 4 in our room) wakes up early (8:30 AM) to speak with the manager. They told us again that he was not there. We checked out later that day with no explanation at all. An apology was in order, but nope it never came. Instead we were rushed out with no apology, no refund, and nothing at all. We did get out 20 dollar security deposit back which is a surprise because when the room flooded my friends were told that we'd be paying thousands of dollars worth of damages.

Well, that may wake them up soon with Hilton taking over a property soon and opening up a DOUBLETREE CLUB hotel five minutes from their destination. The hotel is old, needs to be renovated. The rooms are basic, a bed, a small bathroom, a tv with cable but no HBO or extras. Your lucky if you can get 2 beds. I have stayed in their suites as well : Consisting of a room with a pull out sofa and a tiny bathroom (no shower) the king size bed is in a seperate bedroom and has a slightly larger bathroom with a shower. Tv, iron noard, table, and one chair. That's it.... and that's a \"suite\" My advice, en francais, T'ut Suit :) think twice befire booking there.

Catherine. For gay visitors, the location is excellent as the gay village is just a few short blocks further down Ste. Catherine. Needless to say, this weekend the hotel was just crawling with sisters! There are very few big hotels in this area, which is a shame - St. Denis is a block away, with its 3-4 blocks of small restaurants and cafes piled on top of each other; a Metro stop is just a couple of blocks away; you can walk anywhere downtown easily from here. The rest is all very 2-star: the rooms are dull but serviceable, and even though we asked for a quiet non-smoking room, it reeked of years of stale smoke and the double windows couldn't block out the street noise (Berri is a busy street, except during festival weekends when it's closed to traffic). Luckily the A/C was working great, as it was very hot and humid. There's a convenient internet kiosk ($1 for 15mins) in the lobby which worked well. Parking was sold out when we arrived, so we parked in a large private outdoor lot right next door ($15/day); the next morning we got an indoor spot (again $15/day, but tiny - only 16 spaces).", "Date": "August 15, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Rooms": "5", "Value": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Amherst, NH", "Title": "\u201cNew Years Eve Rocked\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4316101", "Content": "I spent New Years Eve in Montreal with 12 of my buddies.

The staff is indeed very rude and does not care at all if you are not happy. Every time we called the front desk to ask for directions or help on where to go for food or entertainment, they didn't have a clue about anything and was like pulling teeth to get them to help. When we asked if they had a vending machine the guy at the front desk told us that no they don't have one and what do we expect for a 3 star hotel! That's actually what he said! We witnessed the girl at the front desk tell someone that there is a $50.00 fee if you check out late and she actually hung up on the person she was telling this to. So if you stay there don't check out late! Also, we arrived at 3:40 in the afternoon. Check in time is 3:00. Our room was not ready yet and we were told it would be another 30 minutes! Room should have been ready at 3:00!! The room itself was OK, A bit outdated. Not the nicest, and definitely NOT worth the $149.00 we were quoted on the phone when we called. We ended up with a last minute deal for $93.00 but I'd say this room was worth maybe $79.00. The girl at the desk told us we had an adjoining room and we ended up with two rooms down completely different hallways. When we asked about this she told us that she didn't know what adjoining meant. We had a couple of problems with maids telling us they had written down on their sheet that we were checking out that day when we weren't so we had to go clear that up with the front desk. And they never did bother to come and give us clean towels or make our beds on our second day. We had to find a maid in the hallway and ask her to come and do that at 5:00 in the evening. The day we arrived our bath tub had hairs all over it. So they clearly don't clean that in between customers. And the \"indoor\" parking has about 10 spots (for $16.00 a day). Good luck getting in and out of that parking garage. We were charged $1.15 for each LOCAL call we made. Usually that is free. We had two rooms and the phone in the other room wasn't working properly. On a positive note, the guy who ran the bar in the restaurant was friendly and far more helpful with directions than the front desk and the young guy who worked in the smoke shop was friendly also and helped us with directions. They should be at the front desk.", "Date": "May 24, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Detroit Lakes, MN", "Title": "\u201cExcellent\u201d", "Author": "txtx77", "ReviewID": "UR3348799", "Content": "I stayed for a night at this hotel and since I came late I requested an extension of the time of the checkout and my request was very nicely accepted.

Upon leaving the hotel we discovered there was indoor parking and asked to speak to the manager about it, since our two night stay turned into a three night stay due to damage while we were parked in the parking lot outside. He was not in and two desk clerks were very helpful with our concerns and issues. However, the first employee we talked to was beyond the point rude. She was not helpful at all and infact insulted us instead. We were told the manager would call us in a day and discuss our concerns with the parking and his employees. He did not call and when we finally called in a couple days later, while we were still on vacation, he made it clear he purposely did not call us and would not help us. After a long chat he said he would call us back in a week after talking to his employees. Well he didn't and when we did again he began yelling and simply hung up on us.
