Do yourself a favor and pay extra to stay at the Sheraton. Although, it is a little more expensive to stay at the Sheraton Universal, it evens out by using the Sheratons's Shuttle Services and avoid Universal Studios parking fee's.

The staff are very friendly and very helpful, especially Anna. Since my son has food allergies we requested a refrigerator to be able to keep special items for him. They set one in the room at no extra cost! They also set a table where my son could do his home school work. We had a spacious double bed room which was very clean. The room ceiling is high and gives you the sensation of an even bigger room. The towels are very small but they change them everyday. In fact I would like to use those small towels at home now because they are more earth friendly. A little change like this, if we all do it, could help save our natural resources and pollute less. The bedspreads and curtains are rather ugly (made of 100% polyester) but this is only a matter of subjective taste and does not affect the overall positive experience. I do not like donuts that much for breakfast and certainly not everyday for a 15 day stay. I do not drink coffee and the \"juice\" they have has very little juice in it. But, with a fridge in the room I could have whatever I like. I much prefer if they keep the room prices low, rather than making the prices higher and provide a better breakfast. The room has an AC which was very handy during the hot days. Outside the rooms there is a very pleasant lanai, where you could seat and have a sense of privacy, because of the magnificent plants they have. In fact this little hotel is very charming due to the vegetation. Without it, it would be like any other motel. It is like staying in a Hacienda in the middle of the city. I am certainly planning to return to LA and I will definitely want to stay there again. I highly recommend it!", "Date": "September 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "AZ", "Title": "\u201cBest value if you are looking for a place to sleep\u201d", "Author": "AZPhoenix5", "ReviewID": "UR108325791", "Content": "I stayed at this Inn for 5 days while attending a seminar at the Hilton Universal Studio. It was the best value for my money since I only slept and showered at this Inn. If you are looking for more amenities, be willing to pay more. The staff is friendly, especially the manager, Anna. My room was made up when I came back at the end of the day. The location is really close to dining, shopping, entertainment. You can even take the bus to Universal Studios and save money on parking. The only thing I can negatively comment on is the quality of the bath towels. They are thin and rough. Looks like 3rd hand me downs from the 2nd class hotels...:) Parking is tight but you are guaranteed one space per room FOR FREE. It will cost you at least 20 bucks at the bigger hotels. My advice: Be clear about the purpose of your stay. If you plan to stay in and around a hotel to take advantage of its amenities, then go to the bigger hotels. If you are looking to just use the bed and shower, this is the place. By the way, the Inn provides unlimited fresh donuts (lots of variety), coffee, and juice, That is at least a $5-10 value if you go to Starbucks.", "Date": "May 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Salem, MA", "Title": "\u201cIt's Alright\u201d", "Author": "thewoodith", "ReviewID": "UR87051422", "Content": "The El Patio Inn located in Studio City California is your generic basic motel. Its located about 10 mins driving time from the nearest train station with access to Hollywood and also is about a 10 min drive to Universal Studios where once you arrive there your required to pay to park but the motel says its close by. All and all the room was normal basic with bed and shower and sink and toilet. Nothing special to say about this place except there seemed to be a few people outside during the entire time enjoying some herbal drugs. So if your gonna stay here make sure to bring a breath mint and get ready to walk and walk and walk.

We get there and \"Anna\" told us that it was going to be another $210 for the second guest. Now we didn't request anything special or a special type of room. All we did was show up and tell her we wanted to check in. We called priceline, informed them of what she was trying to do as well as the 2.50 a day charge to use WATER... they called her and she denied EVERYTHING that she had told us. We went back into the tiny office area and asked for our registration card back because we weren't going to pay another 210 on top of what we had already paid for on priceline. She pushed the card further under the desk and said \"I just can't do that\". We then said \"We don't plan on staying here, please give us our information card back, you don't need it.\" She then turned to us and said \"You're on camera, [--]!\" and walked into her home/office whatever it is. She is now not returning calls to priceline to refund our money and refuses to talk to us to work it out. We're now in the process of filing a claim in court to get our money back.

My boyfriend and I stayed here a few months ago. This hotel is very small, with one little parking lot and all the rooms surround it. Check in was easy and the woman at the desk was nice. The rooms are very nice and different than a standard hotel room. They have a 50s charm to them which I love. For the cheap price, the room is large and has a tv, air conditioner, fridge, and microwave. There's also a tv, table and chairs, dresser with a mirror, and a comfy bed. The internet was pretty expensive though, $10 a day. The location is excellent. It's right on Ventura blvd in Studio City. There's tons of food and shopping and the tv/movie studios are a few minutes away. My only complaint is about the bathroom. The floor and shower seemed dirty and the shower took forever to warm up, but that wouldn't turn me off from this place. I would definitely stay again. For only $80 in this area it's an excellent value.

What a rip-off. I made a reservation for three night over the phone because the phone rate was $40 LESS than Expedia's. I secured the first night with my credit card as requested.

The place was shabby anyway - dinky room, hair dryer didn't work, no drinking glass, paper-thin towels, bad lighting, old air conditioning unit up by the ceiling and hard to reach to adjust. I left.
