It was my husband, our two and a half year old daughter, my mother-in-law and myself. It did NOT look like a cheap motel. The entrance was VERY pretty and well kept. The service was AMAZING and very friendly! We took a family room and it was VERY CLEAN and great. There was a small tower like wall complete with little doorway that my daughter just loved. We even had two t.v's in the room with plenty of channels and it was a plasma too so it was clear viewing. We were very comfortable. After my mother-in-law and daughter turned in for the night me and hubby had a great time dancing and having drinks (FANTASTIC PRICES!) in the restaurant. It was Thursday night and they had a DJ. We took a romantic stroll in the nice, lush green grounds and even played billiards in the game room. We thought we were going to be stuck bored in our rooms and we were surprised at how much fun we had. In the morning, breakfast was delicious, home-made and the service was amazing! We ate in the restaurant balcony in the fresh air and my daughter danced to music while she ate. One of the ladies that was in the front desk gladly went to the restaurant to warm a bottle of milk for my daughter at check out, and when it wasn't warm enough she politely and graciously went back to warm it up some more with a smile. THANK YOU! The staff was super helpful and friendly and sooo nice, and the guy working the restaurant was fantastic in making and serving the food. We liked it so much hubby and me want to come back for a romantic getaway and it's minutes away from Las Cascadas water park and an Ice skating rink. Food costs extra though but we didn't find it expensive at all and the fitness center is really just one weight machine thingy but we weren't going to use the gym so it didn't bother us at all.

I will start from getting there. First off, the motel gives you directions to the motel on their web site, but only from the town, since I was coming from Bayamon I had to look them up on MapQuest which only got me to the town and from there I figured out where they where from the motels directions. Once I arrived at around 4:30, I found that there where two wedding receptions at the motel. One of the reception halls is acroos the way from the rooms, and that proved challenging to try and sleep with the music so loud. Since, it was raining that day the floors and stairs that lead to the 2nd deck rooms where really slippery, so watch your step. On day 2 and 3, we had problems with no hot water to shower with in the mornings (this was eventually fixed each day). The motel sits in the middle of a community and is set up so it looks and feels like and oasis - they almost pulled it off except for when your at the pool you can see the projects right across the street. The motel is only 5 minutes from Crash Boat beach which is a plus. The staff gets an excellent grade for service and support. They go out of their way to help you and are very friendly- my hat goes off to them. The staffs support made up for some of the problems with the motel but not all.
