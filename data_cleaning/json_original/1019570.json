Right beside the hotel is a police station with a penitentiary for foreigners in custody pending deportation as well as a mosque. The hotel itself is located at a noisy street, thus together with the mosque this was not the ideal place to relax in the evening. Rooms: General Appearance - old fashioned and run down, especially our bathroom. There was an old refridgerator in our room which made a lot of noise so we simply unplugged it. As to electrical sockets: 1 in the room and one in the bathroom. Bed was comfortable, room wasn't too hot or too cold. Bedding seemed ok. Bathroom was old and stained. I saw other bathrooms in the hotel which were modernized but not ours. We asked to change our room but were refused as they told us that this was the best room in the entire hotel. Breakfast: normal selection of typical turkish food. Tablecloth and tableware were stained thus seemed dirty. People were smoking everywhere in the hotel even though it is against the law to smoke in hotels. The luggage room was unattended, thus leaving us with an uneasy feeling. The staff tried to push us to book tours. Everything did function all right but I have been in other hotels for the same price which were a lot lovelier. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone, rather stay in a hostel or pay more.", "Date": "April 11, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Moscow, Russia", "Title": "\u201cNice and budget place to stay.\u201d", "Author": "koteikos", "ReviewID": "UR121257062", "Content": "We were 3 couples and stayed there on January 2011 for 5 days. The place was quite cheap for us. We got nice clean rooms, they were small, but this wasn't a problem for us, we had just a place to sleep. The staff was friendly and welcome, no problem here. The hotel located not far from the centre of historical part of the town and from tram station. It is also not far from the shore, so you can go down and buy a fresh fish and ask a nearby restraunt to cook it for you. The hotel isn't far from many shops and food courts where you can have cheap and tasty dishes. We found only two minuses of this place: 1. Breakfasts in the hotel weren't good, we all didn't like it, don't use. 2. They have thin walls there, so you can hear what your neighborhoods do, but luckily there weren't many guests that time. Anyway, we had good time and warm memories about Istanbul and the hotel also, I can recommend it.", "Date": "November 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "philadelphia", "Title": "\u201cnice people, dirty hotel\u201d", "Author": "luxhill", "ReviewID": "UR120022792", "Content": "We had confirmed reservations at a nearby hotel ( Malabadi beyezit) for 55 eruos. hey stiffed us but hustled us down the hill to this place.

A lot of what they say is right (the breakfast is just about ok, they seem to be running some kind of import/export business with Africa from the lobby, and so on) but AS LONG AS YOU GET A ROOM ON THE FRONT, and I can't stress that enough, you should be all right. The location is perfect for most of the sights in Istanbul, yet the area is genuinely, authentically (perhaps even too authentically...) local. The manager, Ramazan Gol, tries to be helpful and speaks good English. The other staff try to be helpful but don't speak a word of anything other than Turkish, sometimes with quite hilarious results! The only thing that really irritated us, because it was so stupid and needless, was that despite the fact we booked months before coming here, when we arrived we were put in rooms I am loath to even call by that name. Stifling little cupboards under the stairs might be more appropriate. When we remonstrated, we were almost immediately shown to perfectly pleasant rooms a few floors up, on the (non-noisy) front. So WHY ON EARTH weren't we put there from the start? It would've have changed our whole attitude to the hotel and this review would probably have been a lot better!! Oh, and be warned: don't take the manager's proffered recommendation of a fish restaurant in the horrendously touristy area just behind the back of the hotel. We stayed in Istanbul for five days and generally ate very well for very little money. At the fish restaurant we ate appallingly badly and got thoroughly ripped off, after being accompanied there personally by the manager who assured us that the restaurant owner would \"take good care of us\". He certainly did that!", "Date": "October 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco, California", "Title": "\u201cPros & Cons\u201d", "Author": "casjf", "ReviewID": "UR105948627", "Content": "Pros: * Good location: 2 stops on street car from Sultanahmet area & near fish restaurants * Very service-oriented & helpful hotel manager, Ramazan Gol * Clean bathroom, sheets, & blankets * Free Internet Cons * Very noisy, especially if your room is near the staircase from lobby * Dirty floor/carpet in room * V. small, claustrophobic room with a somewhat grimy feeling * Very poor lighting * Desk staff other than hotel manager friendly but in general incompetent: a message we left for 2 friends at 10PM was not passed on to them when they arrived at midnite -- in fact our friends were told we had checked out!
