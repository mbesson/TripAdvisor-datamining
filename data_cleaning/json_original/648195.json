{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Loved the Grand Floor doubles Arrived back in Tokyo for our last 3 nights after travelling around Japan for 2 weeks and having stayed in all manner of hotels. This is a new modern hotel, very comfortable beds and is just steps away from the Metro stop so convenient to get everywhere. Our check in was very efficient and our room was adjacent to the elevator on the top floor, no elevator noise and it almost seemed like we were the only ones staying on this floor, it was so quiet! Breakfast was included and was served in the cafe next door. It had a good range of western food if thats what you want, but the Japanese noodles, fish and pickles etc. were really good. The reception staff are very helpful and reccomended a wonderful (but expensive) tepanyaki restaurant just down the street. Check out, MaDoy if you're feeling flush! Interenet is available in the room but do not expect any help if you have problems connecting. We did as I have a Linux computer and we were told they only support Windows.", "Date": "Nov 1, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR991382959", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Tipsy252"}, {"Content": "Good Clean New Buisness Hotel I stayed here for one night and I liked the fact that it was quite new. The room was small, enough for one person. With two people, it'd be best not to bring too much luggage. The front desk staff were professional and friendly and The Japan Times was delivered to my door in the morning. There's also a cafe on the first floor that serves breakfast but I didn't eat there. You can find lots of restaurants and other cafes in the Akasaka area or you can take the metro (Akasaka station) that's one minute from the hotel (exit 7)I'd stay here again because it's close enough to Roppongi without all the noise.", "Date": "Sep 8, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR788706756", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "SagamiGal"}, {"Content": "Awesome Location, Petite well-appointed rooms What a find!!!! After a lot of research (since I was booking for another couple, I did more research than usual) we booked a stay at the Chisun Grand through asiarooms.com. The location was great. The Akasaka subway stop is about two blocks away. The line that passes through Akasaka is great because you can go two stops either way on the line to connect to other major subway lines to get the the places you want to go...Shinjuku, Asakusa, Shibuya, etc. There's a little grocery store on the way to the hotel from the train so we often grabbed fruit or yogurt for breakfast to keep in the refrigerator in the room. You are also within walking distance of Roppongi. Okay, enough about the great location. The hotel is either new or recently renovated. The rooms, I must say are very, very, very, very small. There is about two feet around the bed on all sides. It is not a place to go with someone you are not comfortable being in close proximity with. There is no sides the the room. There is just the room. Regardless, I would stay there again without a second thought. The vegetarian restaurant attached to the hotel is not great. It is no a place I would recommend.", "Date": "Jul 19, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR243770903", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "elh"}, {"Content": "Great hotel for a business traveler This was the second hotel we had stayed in while in Tokyo and found it to be well maintained and in a good location. There were several lovely restaurants in the area including a fantastic noodle shop between the hotel and subway stop and a delightful Italian restaurant farther from the subway stop.However, we were on vacation and found the hotel to be a bit more business-oriented. There was no business center to access email so we had to use a smoky internet cafe down the street. Also, the staff were not as helpful (unlike our other experiences where the staff went above and beyond the call of duty) at suggesting particulars on travel arrangements as at our other hotels in Kyoto or Tokyo. Since this is in Akasaka - a large business area - it was understandable that the focus was not on tourists' needs, but if this is something you expect from the front desk staff, we would recommend considering another location.", "Date": "Apr 6, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR924461266", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "jkps"}, {"Content": "compact and bijoux This place was certainly unusual....and a good example of Japanese efficiency of space. In a good location - very close to subway and lots of places to eat within 5 minutes....including my favourite teppanyaki place in the whole of the city...Dante....check out the michael jackson picture! The room is tiny but very clean and at $120 pretty decent value for Tokyo. You should not be in your room much in this city so I reckon it is a good bet.

Its location is hard to beat as being in central Tokyo and next to Akasaka stn along Chioyda line. (Note the other chains are Toyoho inn and Fifty inns or Mets hotel though more geared for Japanese local travellers). Not in exactly the business hub but close by. (i.e. opposite to TBS headquarters but within walking or hiking distance to Roppongi and New Otani Tokyo.) However, the room is terribly small. It may be just enough for single resident (All rooms are 2 persons room and most are superior double with less than queen size bed and only one twin room has 2 double bed but is excessively priced). It is definitely crowded for couples. I would not consider staying if not travel alone. Difference for one person in double bed room with 2 person is 2000 Yen. Breakfast is included in the price (? universal or not). It is highly recommended. If not included. then consider paying the 1200 Yen for the organic breakfast. This is just simple continental western/japaness mixed breafast with emphasis on salad dishes.I am not lucky enough as one of the other contributors did to get a 34 LCD TV. Mine is a 14 desktop LCDTV with horrible audio quality. Channel is BBC only (Local channel only one and the rest is pay per view with empasis on adults movies). But anyway the size of the room is not meant for occupuants to hang around for TV viewing.Bathroom facility is adequate.To give plus points to this new hotel, the ergonomic planning allow all hotel amenities to be packed in a small 10 m sq cubicle. The staff is friendly . Night life is possible on the street of hotel.However, the limitation of room size will not put this hotel in any rank better than the 88 in popularity index in the tripadvisor web site.", "Date": "Oct 17, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR272771003", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "2", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "chungmayo"}, {"Content": "Smallest hotel room ever seen The first night we stayed in this hotel, the room turned out to be the smallest hotel room we'd ever seen in our lives. The bed was around 2/3 the size of a normal double bed, was boxed in with walls on 3 sides, and with about 50cm of room on the one side which didn't have a wall. The ceiling was very low, and the bathroom extremely small. We even had to take our bags into the hallway to pack them.We stayed for 3 nights in total, and the 2nd and 3rd nights we moved to rooms in the East Wing, which were marginally bigger.

Besides it was literally right next to the subway, so that was an added bonus. When we arrived, somehow there was a little miscommunication between wotif.com and the hotel, in that we had prepaid for 3 nights, but the hotel thought we were only staying for one night. This was fixed up straight away, and we were greeted with a very modern look superior double room, which was on the small side,but nonetheless had everything we needed. It was a very comfortable stay. Perhaps the only 2 complaints i had (which is not really the hotel's fault), is that 1. As Akasaka only has a subway station, it was abit more pricey for us as we had a JR Pass and hence had to pay for subway to and from hotel. 2. Although exit 6 Akasaka station had upgoing escalators to the ground level, it was a struggle hauling theheavy suitcase down those stairs to catch the subwqay when we were leaving. I wish Tokyo stations were more elderly friendly (ie. elevators/escalators). If u don't like stairs, don't access Exit 7 asrecommended on their website.", "Date": "Jun 3, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR395152604", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "calby"}, {"Content": "Almost brand new, handy location Booked into the Chisun Grand for an overnight stay before heading to Narita the next day. Came in on the Shinkansen and took the metro here - if doing so take the Marunouchi Line to Kokkai-gijidomae and change to the Chiyoda Line for Akasaka station. Then take exit 6 (not 7 as the hotel suggests) as it has an upriding escalator - turn left at street level and the hotel is about 50m away. Otherwise its probably a 1000 yen or so cab ride from the train station.Its well located in the Akasaka district with plenty of eating options, though many places are closed on a Sunday as it seems to be in a bit of a business district. The hotel is almost brand new (opened in late 2006), and the room I had, while small by Western standards, was comfortable, with a small closet and 34cm LCD TV (only foreign channel being BBC World) and free in room internet access. Toiletries were provided, as well as the usual Japanese electronic toilet that you get everywhere. It even had a window that opened for fresh air (and when closed did a top job of blocking out the street noise), and included an effective separate blackout curtain. There are vending machines in the foyer, though there are so many vending machines everywhere in Tokyo they are hardly necessary, and in need there is an AMPM nearby as well as a 24 hour mini supermarket on the same street.

The place is more or less new (opened in December 2006) and looks that way. The place has a boutique, upmarket feel to it (it appears small and very quiet, but probably is bigger than it looks at first glance - I did not explore), and staff are friendly and speak English well.My room was spotlessly clean, and whilst quite small (the double bed fills about half the room), comes complete with items such as a working desk and comfy chair on wheels, trouser press, fridge (with complimentary bottle of water, however no minibar, but convenience stores in the same street sell drinks to fill it with), tea making equipment, fully adjustable aircon, small flat panel tv, and last but not least free Internet in the room (using network cable available from reception).Apparently they have Western and Japanese style rooms, I chose Western and thus had a Western bathroom, with one exception being the toilet, a Japanese electronic toilet with wireless remote control for its various interesting functions (heated seat, two kinds of shower devices, etc.). Also the otherwise normal bath tub has been placed in a floating way without sealing around the sides and the top, an interesting feature making it look very flash. The floor tiles in the bathroom also had something new about them for me, with an interesting anti-slip feature.The hotel is 20 meters from exit 6 of the Akasaka metro station (you can get there door-to-door from Narita via train and metro, but have to change twice), and the street it is located in is full of restaurants and various stores. There are at least two organic restaurants located on the hotel premises (did not try them).", "Date": "Apr 13, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR635198925", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "sergio2008"}, {"Content": "W\u7709rde es sofort wieder verwenden   showReview(14730077, 'full');", "Date": "Mar 25, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR756939058", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Wow besser ist fast nie moeglich!   showReview(11304327, 'full');", "Date": "Nov 14, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR153205154", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "grand chisun akhasaka   showReview(11304326, 'full');", "Date": "Nov 2, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR895549547", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Super!!!   showReview(11415950, 'full');", "Date": "Apr 18, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR189026964", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1066451-d648195-r21453087-Chisun_Grand_Akasaka-Minato_Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html", "HotelID": "648195", "Price": "$182"}}
