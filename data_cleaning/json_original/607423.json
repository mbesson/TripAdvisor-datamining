Yes its old and to do with a paint job but it is so conveniently located we would definately stay here if we ever came back to Tokyo.We paid less than AUD$100 per night and our first room was really small as are alot of Japanese rooms but when we asked for something larger.for an extra $125 for the week we got a huge room with 2 king singles a lounge and separate bathroom,very spacious and quiet.", "Date": "May 28, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR154791920", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "koolkat-7"}, {"Content": "Excellent location and wonderful tourist hotel       Touganeya hotel lobby", "Date": "May 20, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR742948357", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "trekkari"}, {"Content": "7 nights a very cheap and good hotel. location is the best. the only problem is bringing 6 big luggages from the subway to ground floor. very near JR line and ueno station. the most convenient place, safe and clean. good friendly hotel staff.

It is right off the JR Ueno stop. It is a small room, a bed and a little table, but you get your own bathroom and who spends that much time in their room anyways.

We stayed in early April 07 when arriving in Japan and again in late April before leaving. The room was tiny, but was clean and has everything you need. The location right near Ueno station is excellent - close to Ueno park and museums, a nice walk to Asakusa district, and very near the bustling markets of Ameyoko-cho. It was surprisingly quiet at night, so we slept well. Our room rate included japanese breakfast (rice and fish), which we thoroughly enjoyed. The small restaurant has the feel of old Japan - just like you'd imagine from old samurai movies. The hot fish is cooked up by a little old lady whose enthusiastic ohaiyo-gozaimas ! made a great start to the day. Plus there is free internet and English newspaper in the lobby so you can keep up with the news or check email. There is a laundry room at reasonable cost. My wife and I were well satisfied with our experience and would stay there again.- Red Deer, Alberta", "Date": "Apr 21, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR507875344", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "SlowPilgrim"}, {"Content": "The Touganeya is everything you need My husband and I love this little hotel. It is unbelievably close to Ueno station. The staff is wonderfully helpful, and not too bad in the English department either. I needed to find a friend's restaurant in Ginza one night. The staff spent a good 45 minutes helping me find it on a map and then gave me perfect directions. The double rooms are tiny, it's true. But they're cosy and have everything you need. And the Japanese breakfast is fantastic. It's cooked every morning in the yakitori restaurant by a woman who seemed like our Japanese mother. Every morning we had the freshest fish, rice, tea, salad, beans, vegetables, and tofu, followed by a cup of American coffee and a warm smile. I would absolutely recommend this hotel.", "Date": "Mar 31, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR881320073", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "sweethawk"}, {"Content": "Another Great Little Japanese Hotel We stayed at the Touganeya Hotel on our last night back from a 3-week train trek throughout Japan. Similar to most hotels in Japan, the room was efficient - small and clean. The front desk was friendly and helped us stow 4 pieces of luggage while we went out to do some last minute souvenir shopping after check-out. Getting to the hotel from the train station took about 10 mins towing some luggage and and needing to ask directions. The location of the hotel feels a little like it's in a back alley, but this is Tokyo and it was very safe.Great place to stay at a great price.
