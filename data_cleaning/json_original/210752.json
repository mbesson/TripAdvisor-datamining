The room also looked out onto an old air con vent and the railway track .Each time a train went past (which was often) the whole room shook. I approached the hotel staff and they told me they were nearly fully booked but offered me a front facing room away from the track, however this room was even smaller and had a shower rather than the requested bath. Most of the staff were pleasant enough however the woman who greeted us did not smile the entire stay. The hotel information was on a scrappy piece of paper in a draw. There was an iron burn mark on the carpet and the bathroom tiles were cracked. The bathroom sink did not drain properly and the shower had no force at all!

It was virtually one of the last places available in the area within budget. I paid \u00c2\u00a3262 for one night with breakfast for a double room. We stayed in room 408 on the 4th floor. Hotel location is great, very close to Earl's court station. Good points: The service was friendly and a gentleman carried our luggage across the road from the main reception to the Kensington Town House (part of Best Western Shaftesbury). The room was clean as far as I could see. The bed was comfortable. The noise level from the road was minimal. There were tea and coffee making facilities. (Unable to comment on breakfast as we did not have time to try it out) Bad points: The room was tiny and hot (though we spotted an air con at the wall the next working which may or may not work) The double bed was virtually squeezed between the entrance to the bathroom and the opposite wall. The window rattled in the breeze The drain in the shower did not flow too well, must be blockage somewhere in the pipes. The hair dryer was not working properly and only blew cold air plus it was fastened to the drawer, however the cord was too short to stand up and blow my hair so I had to sit on a wonky chair which in turn was too low to see myself properly in the mirror (this would only be a problem for women I guess) While the bed was comfortable the cover consisted of a sad looking woolen blanket between two white sheets. That is not the standard of bedding expected for such a high price. Overall verdict: The overall standard was not what you would expect for \u00c2\u00a3262 but it was sufficient for one night.

When I asked why they took our bags and said for us to check in after 2pm the man at the front desk said that we couldn't stay there. So they clearly lied and stole our money for the booking.

The man was also very aggressive to my girlfriend which I was very upset about. We were kicked out of the hotel into the darkness and cold without the money I had payed for the room.

Each experience was different but in the end the same issues came to light. While this hotel is perfectly fine for a couple of nights after a while certain elements became problematic. The hotel is situated directly above an underground tunnel therefore no matter which floor you are on, the frequent noise of the subway is an issue, especially for those with jet lag. The customer service is lacking in terms of the front desk, the porters are excellent but the general front of house staff have no idea of the concept of privacy - and openly discuss private guest matters with a complete disregard for customers. The internet access is sporadic - despite being advertised as free in room and the phones don't work. I had to move room 4 times in order for them to work out that the fault was the network rather than the room and the staff were annoyed at the fact I had the gall to complain (despite the fact I was there on business and needed net access). The bed sheets were not changed on a whole 7 night period, the rooms could do with a deep clean, the carpets are dirty and on the whole could be better. The breakfast is not served in house rather you have to go across the street to another hotel to sample it. The rooms are very small, do not believe that you are booking into a 'superior' or 'deluxe' room as this is just nonsense. The hot water didn't work on average of two days per week. One other very important thing to note is the fact is that the Townhouse often overbook or lose bookings and have to find alternative arrangements for their clients. This is not a good thing to have to face when you've just gotten off a flight. The car service is also at an extreme premium and costs in excess of 50 % what a normal taxi would (they are easy to flag down at the end of the street). In general this hotel has good transport links (is two mins walk from Earl's Court) but its lack of customer service, the lack of net access, its inability to clean its rooms to a sufficient standard and the noise of the subway are it's major downpoints.

Problem 1: Room was definitely not worth \u00c2\u00a3275 per night (so good job we didn't pay that!) It was quite a big room for London, however the bed was very short (my feet reached the end and I'm 5'8\"!). The en-suite was so tiny you could not sit on the toilet as the sink was right in front of you (I'm not exaggerating, I literally has to sit on it sideways!). Problem 2: The electrics. No WiFi (all room's are advertised with WiFi), Television kept randomly changing channel as if some one else was controlling it! Air-con did not work at all and the room was so hot we needed some! Which leads me on to..... Problem 3: When we tried to open the window to let cool air in (couldn't turn radiator off and it was on full blast the whole time), there were work men right outside (like 1 foot away from our window, who we'd already heard talking for a few hours before hand) doing some drainage to the water system, giving off an awful rotten smell. This went on from around 7am till after we checked out! The smell got in to our room as well. Problem 4: Our room was in the basement and every 2 minutes on the dot the room vibrated as the tube went past! It couldn't be ignored, they were significant vibrations and quite a loud sound. I thought it would stop by 12.40am (when tube finishes for night) but it seemed to continue all night! It really disturbed my sleep. Problem 5: No hot water in shower (possibly related to what the workers were fixing) so we had to go to a different hotel and use that shower. Apparently this problem affected all the rooms in the hotel. Problem 6: Thinnest walls I've ever experienced in a hotel. I don't want to think I'm being unfair to this hotel but I thought it only fair to those considering the 'amazing' deal to know that the room they will most likely give you will be in the basement and will not be up to the rest of the hotels standards and you will be kept awake by the tube. I think all the other problems were just due to us being unlucky really. Positives: Everything else said, it was still a decent room; There were good tea making facilities; Iron and board; TV; mirrors; REALLY good breakfast (served in the Shaftsbury hotel over the road- which looked like a really nice hotel); nice pleasant staff; very close to Earls Court tube station; clean; midday checkout (always nice to get that extra hour!).

I have never been treated this way in 25 years of travelling. Our tiny room at the \"Townhouse\" was only the size of the actual double bed itself with no space to move about and we felt totally claustrophic. So claustrophic in fact that we had to get out and go and have a few drinks, and then dinner. Its a truly miserable place! The noise levels were intense from the traffic outside and we hardly slept a wink. There is NO double glazing?? It was my birthday and I complained in the lobby to the manager and things got VERY heated and I lost my temper with him bigtime. We finally got compensation in that we were moved over the road to a 4 star hotel and he gave us the best room in that other hotel but the damage was already done, although it pays to complain in that he finally charged us only 2 nights for the price of 3, and of course got the upgrade and free breakfasts.

It is also a shame this hotel (indeed, the group chain) adopts a practice of over-booking to such an extent, as their rooms, service and general value seem fair - on the face of it. At this hotel, we have specifically witnessed over-booking on several occasions, the most recent occasion being this week. We have stayed at several of the Shaftesbury hotels over a period of a year (in excess of 40 nights), and have witnessed weary travellers arriving only to be greeted with the stale-faced rejection of \"Sorry, there's no room at the inn\"! Shaftesbury could write a \"Book of Excuses\", but these range from : - Are you sure it's this hotel; or - We've mislaid your booking; to - There's a maintenance problem with your room. Mostly the excuses seem plausible in isolation, and it seems valiant that they arrange a taxi to take you to another hotel. However, when these excuses have been heard so often, and guests then endure the poor service when transferred to another hotel, it's easy to understand the frustration expressed by earlier reviewers is under-stated. We have specifically suffered being moved to areas we didn't want to be in, the rooms were rarely as described (even if the aircon was working), no meaningful apology or compensation was ever offered, and if we wanted to negotiate any modification relating to our tariff we would have to contact the original hotel that couldn't accommodate us.

The rooms are furnished to a very high standard with large flat-screen televisions and comfy beds. Now the bad news: The rooms are *tiny*. I had a double on the top floor and there was no desk, no chair, the only place to sit was on the bed. The reason there is no desk or chair is that there was nowhere to put it, the room being only slightly larger than the double bed! Furthermore the noise from the underground (District Line) was terrible. I'd read the previous reviews complaining about the noise and though \"I'm a sound sleeper. How bad can it be?\". The answer is: it's shocking. The trains start just after 5:30am, and that's the time you'll be waking up.

Earl's Court is a stop in Zone 2 but right next to zone 1. It's on the picadilly line which comes straight from heathrow. It's only about a minute from the station and that's because of the cross walk. There's pubs, cafes, bakeries, McDonalds, KFC, Thai restaurant, indian etc. so much around that area. It's about a 20min tube ride away from most places that are of interest to tourists. As for the room, it is small but so clean. The bathroom is extremely small . But what can you do? Who really cares anyway? we were there to explore the city, we only slept in the room. we were on the 3rd floor, with no noise at all. It's perfect for the price, it was so clean and that's the most important thing to me when I look for a room All in all, it was a great stay. The staff was extremely nice and ready to help.

Located on a very nice street in Earls Court, just steps from the tube, the Hogarth Hotel is a modern and very well maintained (spotless rooms and gorgeous bathrooms) hotel. YES, the room was small...HOWEVER I was on my own so it was not an issue. For me, cleanliness is more important than size and this place shines. I was assigned a room on the third floor and YES I could hear the tube as previous reviewers have mentioned.

Nice Granny Smith apples, newspapers and magazines at the front desk everyday. I complained about the size and the fact that there was no fridge.

Check in wasn't painful - no one seemed to speak english very well but they found our booking (we booked a deluxe double - \u00c2\u00a355 for the room - bargain!). I was actually pretty blown away when i walked into the room, it was small, it had a flat screen TV on the wall facing the bed - the bed was a good size - bathroom was tiny - small shower cubicle, small toilet and small sink - but heated floors!! A few things - the noise from the underground is pretty obvious - it vibrates the room - i wouldnt say its a massive problem though - but something to bear in mind if you are there for an early night and need to get up early and need a silent night. Secondly - the cleaners - We went out and wanted a lie in in the morning - check out was at midday - the cleaner knocked on the door at 9am - and then proceeded to pound the door with the vacuum cleaner - after opening the door butt naked and screaming something that was probably unintelligable they cleared off. - Put your Do Not Disturb sign up and this might prevent it! Check out was painless. So overall you cant really complain - the tube running beneath it is a bit of a pain but its not the end of the world!
