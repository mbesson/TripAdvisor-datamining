The hotel is well placed opposite Kuta beach. The room was spotless, and the staff were amazingly attentive. The pool area was very clean, and the pool attendants were very helpful and polite. We cannot praise the service highly enough, and would recommend this hotel to everyone.The food was very good, and offered a variety of choice, but there are many restaurants to choose from in the area that can provide anything from traditional Balinese cuisine to pizza. Overall, the smiling happy staff at this hotel are the best that we have experienced throughout the world, and make this hotel a lovely place to stay.

We also had a wonderful head and shoulders massage and on another occasion a foot massage. These were done very professionally.The breakfast each morning was delicious - they had a large variety of dishes to chose from. It was also great having the breakfast on the patio which overlooks the beach.The beach is literally opposite the hotel is good for surfing, although we just did the watching.The rooms however are basic but very clean - it was all we really needed.The nice touch was a bowl of the local fruit given to us when we arrived.There were plenty of taxis right outside the hotel which were cheap to take you to where ever you wanted to go.You can also take walks to the markets and of course to the beach.We have fond memories and can definitely recommend.", "Date": "Aug 23, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR695372325", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "LindaSouthAfrica"}, {"Content": "Only Because of Good Location to Beach I go to Bali every year and have stayed at Istana Rama twice. Maybe because Bali offers so much outside of the hotel resort that I really only need a decent place to rest before am out again, so it didn't really bother me that Istana Rama was quite average.The grounds are huge but you could tell the resort has seen better days. The rooms are OK, clean and comfortable but nothing luxurious for sure. The bathroom is also really basic...we are just glad the toilet flush works and the shower is hot. There is breakfast in the morning (boring toast and eggs), most times we would rather eat out on the streets. We paid a package price but I think the going rate is about USD70 per night and that is steep coz the place is OLD. The only saving grace is the location. Just across the road is Kuta beach in all its glory. We could also get surfing lessons on the grounds of Istana Rama (poolside), so that really worked out for us. We spend most of our time on the beach anyway. All in all, I would say it's passable only if you were going to spend most of your time outside of the hotel room. If you are counting on your resort to give you the experience of Bali, then look elsewhere, there are tons. Try to get a package for this one - I only paid SGD400+ for airfare + 2nights at Istana Rama.", "Date": "Feb 7, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR286478562", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "booster26"}, {"Content": "\u9287\u5a43\u76b8\u9287\ue0a2\u53c6\u9288\u5a3f\u4ef9\u9287\u6b0c\u6ad4   showReview(19913888, 'full');", "Date": "Apr 3, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR257837991", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "\u9287\ue218\u4ed2\u9288\u4f75\u4ef8\u9287\ue1ba\u511b\u9289?#x201d;   showReview(19913518, 'full');", "Date": "Jan 14, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR106954645", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "\u9288\u70b9\u5157\u9289\u66d8\u5045\u9289?#x201d;   showReview(19910993, 'full');", "Date": "Jan 29, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR939213045", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "\u9287\u64b1\u4f04\u9289\u6d96\u5110\u9289\ue0a0\u4f05\u9287\u6c25\u4eef\u9287\u3123\u5136...   showReview(19924374, 'full');", "Date": "Jan 21, 2004", "ReviewID": "UR659850026", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "0", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "\u59e3\u5ea1\u52fe\u9a9e\u6dec\u4f00\u951b\u6391\u6d16\u9289\u6129\u5136\u9287\u6b4c\ue511...   showReview(19917932, 'full');", "Date": "Mar 27, 2003", "ReviewID": "UR526843679", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "0", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297697-d545815-r21592095-Grand_Istana_Rama_Hotel_Bali-Kuta_Bali.html", "HotelID": "545815", "Price": "$97"}}
