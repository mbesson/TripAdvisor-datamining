The main reason was the amazing hotel manager Serpil Hanim. She made sure that everything was perfect for us. She even watched our son while we were having breakfast! The rest of the stuff was very friendly and professional as well. Location is great, rooms are nice and clean, breakfast is very good. We are definitely coming back!", "Date": "November 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Exeter, England", "Title": "\u201cUnexpected hidden gem\u201d", "Author": "Chrisb81", "ReviewID": "UR118940109", "Content": "I cannot say just how surprised we were to find this hidden gem of a hotel. Centrally located and close to osmanbey tube stop, this really is a great modern boutique hotel. It's safe to say that it doesn't exactly have appeal from the outside, lodged between a wig shop and a nail salon, but get up to the very contemporary rooms, and find that, contrary to most hotels in Istanbul, they really have made them modern, well tiled, and I would safely say they surpass 4 star chain hotel standard. Excellent shower, drench style, massive comfy bed, and a good, if expensive minibar. The area around the hotel is within a short stroll of the tube, and of an extremely up market shopping district. Also, a ten to 15 minute walk will get you taksim, central. By some distance though, the best thing about this hotel is the level of service, the desk always offering taxis, transfers and advice. For example, We arrived after breakfast had finished on our first day and were brought fruit, cake and tea, all free of charge. We felt very welcomed. Very rare you receive this kind of service in a major city. Book this hotel, you will not be disappointed.", "Date": "October 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manchester, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201ci loved it ,specially Serpil Sander she is the best trip advisor in istanbul,she is helpful,organized,nice personality\u201d", "Author": "Ola H", "ReviewID": "UR117829556", "Content": "i loved it ,specially Serpil Sander (Riva Boutique hotel) she is the best trip advisor in istanbul,she is helpful,organized,nice personality,booked for me the tours,arrange taxi whenever i need,i loved istanbul cos of her", "Date": "September 8, 2011"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Boutique Riva Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g293974-d858356-Reviews-Boutique_Riva_Hotel-Istanbul.html", "Price": "$84 - $172*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Rumeli Street 15</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Istanbul</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">34371</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Turkey</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "858356", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/0f/53/0f538db1df39c0d48054782058c5476c2large.jpg"}}
