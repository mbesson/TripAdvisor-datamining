To begin with, my trip to dubai was only for 4days, for entire trip I was there the pool, gym, sauna & steam room were not available. I was not told this when I checked in or before I booked my trip. I rang reception three days consecutively to find out if the pool was open yet as each day they would say 'tomorrow'. On the 3rd day I complained the manager who told me the pool & sauna etc would not open for another week! I told him he should have informed all the residents during check in time or thrown a letter under the doors of each resident so they were aware of this. At the end of the day i'm not staying there for free & i'm paying to use facilties they are not providing me. The manager found this all amusing and said \"why should I tell people the pool isn't working\" (of course- he wants to make money- forget what people think). When I told him I will be writing a review about his attitude/hotel etc he said \"go on then, I don't care\". I found that extremely rude and unprofessional. Moreover, the bathroom was very smelly and there was not enough hot water to have a shower lasting more than 6mins! There was black marks all over the carpet. They were supposed to get a maintenance guy to come and check it out, did that happen.. no! I paid a lot of money for this trip and only got half the things (bed & food) no pool, sauna, gym nothing. I asked the manager to allow me and my family to check out late as a form of 'compensation' and he refused. I didn't get any money back or nothing. I would not recommend going to this hotel.", "Date": "February 10, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Overland Park, Kansas", "Title": "\u201cDecent room, but not much in the way of amenities\u201d", "Author": "ArchiTraveller", "ReviewID": "UR123846333", "Content": "The hotel stands alone, away from most of the attractions of Dubai. This means that you pretty much have to take a taxi anywhere you might want to go (though, because there isn't much around it, sometimes it's a wait to get a taxi). It isn't near the metro, and there aren't dining options nearby. They do offer a restaurant in the hotel, which isn't bad. The room I had was quite comfortable, and the staff was really warm and accommodating. The guest rooms face either the skyline of downtown Dubai, or the industrial port. I had a room on the skyline side, and never tired of seeing the Burj Kalifa glimmering in the morning and evening light. I don't think that the view from the other side was nearly as good. It appears that there had been a significant leak in the rooftop pool at one point in time. I was on the 4th floor (the highest floor of guest rooms), and there were a couple spots of water damage in my room (nothing major). Walking down the 4th floor corridor, however, paneling on the wall was buckled and I saw in to a few other rooms while they were being cleaned that appeared to have some pretty significant water damage.", "Date": "January 30, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cValue for money.
