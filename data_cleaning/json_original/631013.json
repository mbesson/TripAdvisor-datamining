Definitely as lovely as the photos. Location is great- very close to Norton St nd great cafe just around the corner.However, we booked two apartments, 1 for 4 nights, 1 for 2 nights, and literally 2 hours before our family arrived to stay for 2 nights I was phoned by the hotel  told that they had just sold our apartment to somebody else  we would therefore have to stay in Chatswood!! We had booked our apartment in May, and received confirmation at that time. Now the owners had the hide to say that because it was an internet booking they had given it away! This weekend was to be something of a family reunion as we all live in different parts of Australia, so we were not happy to have 1 group stay in Petersham and the other in Chatswood.Eventually the issue was resolved, but we booked (and paid for) a city view room and weren't given one. In fact the pantry in the room was full so we believe that the apartment was possibly the owners, or a permanent tenant.This issue tainted my view of the place, but it was really great. Fabulous prices too.Oh, the only other thing is the rooms are pretty hot and there are no fans, so that could be an issue is Summer.", "Date": "Oct 4, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR249723860", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "trav3la"}, {"Content": "Excellent in all ways 3 of us stayed here for 4 nights at the penthouse suite.Lovely skyline views of Sydney from the balcony - which was massive by the way.the large apartment itself is ultra modern and excellent condition throughout.There are a few decent restaurants nearby especially in Norton street which is about a 10 minute walk.I was a bit worried about the location but its got good bus services from parramatta road so no problem there either.1 small hiccup seems to be the laundry room. There is no space for the dryer, which has been put in the living room which is a shame as it is distracting from the general appeal of the room. If only they had bought front loader washers instead of top loaders there would have been space in the laundry room for the dryer.I would highly recommend anyone to stay here", "Date": "Aug 25, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR279406081", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Rikkimca"}, {"Content": "It was Awesome Me and my friends stayed there for the weekend, couse we were in Sydney for Pink's concert that by the way was great ; ).Cascata is beautiful, the rooms are huge really brightly,the staff is friendly and efficient...everything was fine...so enjoy it!!!Sarah", "Date": "May 21, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR222785640", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "SaritaAuckland"}, {"Content": "Loved this brand new serviced apartment       dining kitchen", "Date": "Feb 12, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR323963755", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "mrslucky"}, {"Content": "Disaster Booked for New Year 2006 in August 2006 and were told that they would contact us prior to the date to let us know check in details.New property that was to have been available on Dec 1 2006.Had I not contacted them one day prior to our check in date(having recd nothing from them)my overseas visitors and I would have turned up on New Years Eve and found only a security guard turning people away.They had known prior to 1/12 that property had structural faults and a second builder had been employed to take over the project,but did not have the common courtesy to let any of their patrons know-one family with 4 young children were also turned away.They offered lame excuses but no solutions.Very incompetent,not interested in helping solve the problem-negligent in the extreme in not contacting anyone.", "Date": "Jan 28, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR869652391", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "keval01"}, {"Content": "Don't take the chance Why don't stay there... well because they almost ruined our holiday! We booked our accommodation with them in August 2006 for the New Years period of 06/07. We frequently checked with them to see if the apartments were going to be ready in time (we were arriving 27th December and they were due to open on 1 December). They told us they had had some delays but would DEFINITELY be open by the time we arrive. We got an email less than 12 hours before we were due to get on the plane to say they were NOT going to be open and that we would need to find somewhere else to stay. You try finding last minute accommodation in Sydney for New Years! I am extremely dissappointed they they did not bother to even ring us to let us know. It is only by chance that we checked our email before we left. There is no way that one week before we were due to arrive they didn't know they weren't going to be ready. My advice would be to book with someone else", "Date": "Jan 7, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR178517481", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "natonholiday"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g255060-d631013-r10851565-Annam_Suites_Cascata-Sydney_New_South_Wales.html", "HotelID": "631013", "Price": "$184"}}
