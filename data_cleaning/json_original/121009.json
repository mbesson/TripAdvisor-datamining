If you are looking for 4 - 5 star fancy, and the Ritz, this is not the place for you. But if you want a clean, safe place for a short stay. Consider this hotel. By the way, I am reviewing the one on 69 Boston St. as I believe there are several. Here are some values: Free parking so you can come and go. Free shuttle to Metro (subway) Full breakfast with attentive and helpful staff. It was not a menu - cooked to order, but we found it way ahead of typical \"continental breakfasts\" Quick elevators; push the button and the door opens (some require a long wait) Best of all: the staff is genuinely helpful and seemed concerned that guests enjoy not just survive. I'm not used to stopping at the desk each morning to greet workers on duty, but they went the extra mile to be helpful. I'd rather have this than stay at a fancy place where the people are starchy or artificial in their friendliness. The room was clean; heat worked quickly and quietly (Feb.) For those who have read grumpy reports about this place, we really wonder what they are talking about. We were impressed. Example; we had a small leak in the minivan radiator; nothing serious but I needed to add some water one morning. The hotel manager Dennis was passing by and he said \"If you need anything or there is any way we can help, please don't hesitate to ask.\" Finally, there price was about average for the city - or perhaps a little better; but when you figure in free parking, it was a good buy. By the way, there was a small refrigerator and a mincrowave oven in the room; next property was a small strip mall with a Panera Bread restaurant (excellent) and an Olive Garden (fair - not impressed)", "Date": "February 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oak Bluffs, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cGross\u201d", "Author": "laura0299", "ReviewID": "UR124875003", "Content": "We only stayed here for the park and fly promotion which was good, although I was nervous my car wouldn't be there when we returned, or broken into.

The trap was between the wall and the bed, and the trap was set. NO mouse was in the trap, but I seriously could not believe what I saw. My thoughts were this: Did this hotel have mice? If so, would you really attempt to kill them while paying customers slept in the hotel? What if they caught the mouse, would they risk the chance of a dead mouse be in the trap while customers stayed there? I even thought, maybe it was a prank from the last guests..Probably with that theory is, if it were a prank, certainly the maids would have seen the trap, and taken it away! Of course they would, UNLESS they cleaned the room so POORLY, they didn't even look near the headboard and didnt even vacuum the room! Either way its a LOSE LOSE for this property..

Hotel prices (and parking) are very high downtown and this was the closest, reasonably priced ($150) hotel I could find. It was faily easy to get to and parking was free and secure but limited. The parking lot was shared with an adjacent hotel so I guess we could've parked over there if needed. The attached restaurant is currently closed but their is a shopping plaza directly behind the hotel that has an Applebees and Olive Garden. The plaza also has all the big boxes such as Target, Best Buy, etc. I takes about ten minutes to walk to the stores. The subway is near but a little longer than the 5 minute walk they claim. Closer to 10 minutes and the area you walk through is one I wouldn't be in after dark. During the day I felt very safe though. Very easy to learn the subway system and you can get all your passes right at Andrews Station. No problems at all with the entire subway system in Boston. Expected to see many buses too like Chicago and D.C. but they didn't exist at least downtown. The hotel was a little disappinting. The breakfast was very good with a lot of variety but the eating area is small and most days we had difficulty getting a table. They have coffee available all day and night and serve chocolate chip cookies at 6 PM nightly. The staff was very friendly and helpful with suggestions. Housekeeping was also responsive to any request we made. The room itself was not the greatest. It did have a fridge which was nice and the beds were large for doubles, almost queen size and very comfortable. The two problems I had was even though we had four people in the room they were very stingy with the bathroom towels and nightly we had to call housekeeping for more. One day they left a single wash cloth for four people to use! The main problem I had with the room was a mouse evidently was staying with us too as one night it got into our snack bag and had a field day. I informed housekeeping of this and they said they'd tell the front desk about it but nothing ever became of it. We secured everything from then on inside a lock suitcase. The bathroom was a little rundown and even had a hole in the baseboard where I presume the mouse family was staying. Maybe they were taking our towels?? But overall I'd recommend this hotel due to its price and location but would suggest you look around a little more. The hotel adjacent to this one look better and I think it was only $10-20 more per night. I'd probably stay there next time in town. Being near a subway stop is very important though as driving and parking in Boston is impossble. Boston and Cape Cod are great places to visit and we had a good time.

This time I booked it through Priceline and I knew ahead of time which hotel I would be staying at and was also able to find out its amenities before booking my room. And I must say, I have not been disappointed at all. The service was great and prompt. We were upgraded to a bigger room at no cost. The condition and cleanliness of the room was no better or worse than the other hotels I've stayed in the past (Double Tree, Crown Plaza, Radisson etc). The lobby and the reception area are very modest. They did have free Internet services from the lobby, which was great for the kids when they'd get bored while waiting for us in the lobby. The location of this hotel was another reason we decided to stay there. It was 5 minutes walking distance from the Red line (Andrew subway station). I do not like to drive in unfamiliar cities, especially when I have to visit several locations and places. The unfamiliar traffic patterns and parking are too much of a hassle. Granted that there are other hotels also with this convenience, but they mostly located in the downtown areas where the rates would be double or triple what I paid here. The best thing about this hotel was the free parking and free breakfast, neither of which I had experienced before. With two growing kids and 2 adults, these amenities save me about $80 a day. (Most hotels charge about $25 to park the car a day). There was free wireless Internet throughout the hotel. This was not as fast as we are accustomed to. The Internet speed was about 1 Mbps. But it became better later at nights (when there was less network traffic). What this hotel lacked was a gym, a swimming pool and a restaurant.

The only negatives I could come up with were that the walls seemed alittle thin and we could hear noise in the hallway at night, but it did not disturb us. The area that the hotel is located in is also not an area one would walk around to sight see.

The staff at the hotel was very nice, and we had no problems. Our room was clean, and had what we needed as tourists who wanted to spend more time out in the city then in our hotel room. Our toilet tank handle was broken and needed to be jiggled with to work, but we let them know about it. They serve complimentary breakfast everyday, which was a huge blessing for us. It is a buffet style breakfast, and they had a huge spread everyday that included eggs, bacon, sausage, toast, english muffins, bagels, french toast, fruit, muffins, cinnamon rolls, milk, juices, coffee, etc. Overall I would suggest this to anyone who wants to stay on the cheaper side in Boston, who does not mind a 10 minute walk to the T, and can get over the fact its not a 5 star hotel or a 5 star area for that matter.

That was it's ONLY positive attribute. Our room was dirty, there was visibile dust & dirt on the wall, the shower curtain was made of white cloth and looked as though it had never been taken down to be washed after it's initial hanging, the maids spoke NO english so they couldn't tell us why they skipped our room and we had to call down to the front desk to have them double back, and the staff of the hotel were uneducated and rude. When asked how to get to Salem we literally got FIVE different sets of directions, four of which were completely wrong. Our train also arrived late and so we were unable to be in town for our first night which we had prepaid for. Upon calling to advise travelocity of the situation they called the hotel (which if we would have known that's all they did we would have just called ourselves...) and were told there would be no refund. So they got all of our money for a night at the hotel that we were not there. They were also quite rude when our train finally DID arrive and we made it into town. They refused to answer questions as to why we had to pay for a night we were unable to stay when the situation was completely out of our control refusing to say anything other than, \"hotel policy\". They were so unhelpful and downright nasty when we called or stopped by the front desk with questions that we finally just stopped associating with them all together for the remainder of our trip. I now understand why they refuse to give refunds under any circumstances - because anyone in their right mind would demand one and never stay even a single night here. We've been stuck in this hotel for a week because we prepaid and they will not refund our money in order for us to seek better accomodations despite their \"hospitality guarantee\" that if something's wrong they'll make it right or you won't pay. In reality if something's wrong you'll get the 3rd degree until they begrudging come to do a half [--] fixer up and then you'll be shunned the remainder of your time at the hotel. My husband is active military so I've seen my fair share of various hotels, I've never stayed in a Holiday Inn Express before this one so I don't know if this is the rule or the exception, but I certainly will not stay at another in order to find out.

Just remember to head North on Dorchester Av. past the Dunkin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Donuts to find the station.

After discussing our options (walk, bus, taxi) we waited for a shuttle bus to transport us and we got as far as the Broadway station (one stop away). From there we decided to walk down Dorchester Ave. back to the hotel. It was dark in areas as it appeared this was more of an industrial area and left me feeling a little uneasy as not many people were out, plus, the walk was a good mile or more back to the Andrew station but in the end everything worked out OK. As for amenities used, the hotel sent its shuttle to pick us up from the airport when we arrived and the standard continental breakfast suited us well for beginning our day.
