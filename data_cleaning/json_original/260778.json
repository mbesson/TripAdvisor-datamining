However, when we talked to the reception lady, it turned out that this place has a 1 am curfew. This was not advertised anywhere, so we were a bit disappointed. They also said that the front door is closed after 1 am but we can still get out and be back after 7 am. We came back from the bar at 12:55 am and wanted to bring inside some local friends but we were confronted by extremely abnoxious staff and realized that we also cannot bring guests. There was a fake customer who was spying on other guests and reporting to the management. There were also cameras monitoring the activities of guests. I was able to escape at 1:10 am but my friends were unfortunately trapped inside because the \"bald guy\" (the fake customer) closed another glass door between the first and the second floor, and no one was able to leave the hotel (although we should have been able to leave). We believe that this is a serious violation of safety protocol in the province of Venice and of human rights (constituting false inprisonment which is restraint of a person in a bounded area without justification or consent. False imprisonment is a common-law felony and a tort and I assure you that this post is completely serious.) If you believe in human rights and you would like to enjoy your stay in Venice after 1 am with no prison guards, do not book a room in this hostel.

Which is a problem if no one knows you are in there! Also, there was only one key for the dorm, so whoever was last to leave the room would drop off the key and the first one back would pick it up. Other than that. Great location and great value for Venice.

It's also really near bus, train and vaporetto stops, so you can easily access all the major sights of Venice. Although it is based quite a substantial distance from St Mark's on foot (about 40 mins at a slow pace provided you don't get lost), Venice itself is so beautiful that you probably won't even notice how long you've been walking.

We stayed in a double room with its own private bathroom and air conditioning (very important for this time of the year). Overall the room was small but clean (the smell of bleach from the bathroom almost knocked us out when we arrived!). First annoyance was the check-in time, which was about 2-3pm (!!). Same thing with the check out time at about 10am. You will notice they are kicking you out because the air conditioning doesn't work anymore past some time in the morning. Because of these weird check-in/out times we had to leave our luggage in a corridor piled up with many other bags from other guests. We though this was very unsafe as anyone could easily take something without the person at the reception even noticing about it. Second annoyance: you can only pay in cash. No option of breakfast, and the doors are locked at 1am, with the ridiculous excuse of \"there's no much to do in Venice after 1am....\".
