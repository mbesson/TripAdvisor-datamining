The rooms were as expected, small but certainly comfortable. The bathrooms were newly appointed and quite spatious . The concierge staff were very helpful and the room service was excellent when orders were placed. The breakfast visual presentation was impressive but the actual breads, fruit salad and coffee were uneventful and not worth the expense.

The hotel is located on a small and quiet street with a great resaurant , la Ferme de Saint Simon , just a few doors down. I highly recommend it .

The staff all speak English and are most helpful with directions and recommnedations about local restaurants and sites. The common areas are quite beautiful and comfortable. The room we had was small, but typical for European cities--it was comfortable, well appointed--and absolutely quiet--a rare quality in many city hotels. A nice touch was the fact that the hotel contact me by email about 3 days before my visit and offered to arrange for a driver to pick us up at the airport. We were met by a driver in a Mercedes towncar and taken directly (and quickly) from the baggage claim area to the hotel. The cost was $110 euros (compared to $50-70 euros for a cab). After a 3 hour flight delay and a 9 hour flight from the US, it was definitely worth the cost differential not to have to brave the lengthy airport cab line.

We stayed at the Duc de Saint Simon for three nights and, quite honestly, did not have a great experience. I'll give it credit for being very charming and quaint, but that's about it. First of all, we arrived late at night and nobody offered to help us with our bags at all. They just handed us a key and told us the 3rd floor. This is the first hotel I've ever stayed at in Europe where nobody offered assistance to the room. I can overlook that, but once we figured out how to get in to the room with the antique key, we found the smallest hotel room I've ever seen. We barely had room to find somewhere to put our bags that would still allow us any floor space. The bathroom wasn't terribly small, BUT the way the shower was set up, you couldn't put anything on the right side of the vanity because it would get soaked by whomever was showering. There was not avoiding that! I've been to enough places to know that European hotel rooms are typically not very large, but this was just ridiculously cramped. One morning I asked the gentleman at the front desk if he would mind calling a taxi and he said he would. We waited outside for 15 minutes and then went inside to see if it was normal to take so long. His response was \"you asked me to call you a taxi?\" So helpful! One our last night there, we returned to the hotel late at night. The man at the front desk at that time asked us for our room number and asked why we had not given them our key when we left that morning. He then told us that we were supposed to leave our key at the front desk during the day. When I told him that nobody had told us that and we had been there for 3 days already, his smug response was \"well I'm telling you now.\" Everyone has a different experience and judging by the reviews this is a much loved hotel by many. Unfortunately for us, this hotel was not at all impressive. I had very high hopes. It was our last stop on our trip and it was the most expensive hotel we had stayed at. Unfortunately, every other hotel was quite impressive and hospitable and it definitely shed an even more negative light on this one.", "Date": "May 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cMagnifique!\u201d", "Author": "Nicole35805", "ReviewID": "UR108139228", "Content": "We spent seven nights in this elegant hotel and loved every minute of our stay.

For example, when we asked for restaurant suggestions for our first evening, we were told about across the street (duh) and that there were some cafes around some corners (oh, you'll find it).

We'd loved the 5th, enjoyed the 6th, and I'd assumed you couldn't be anywhere in Paris that wasn't interesting and wonderful. Well you can, and we were. There was construction, but no life on the streets. The hotel seems designed to feel clubby but with tiny spaces it felt only claustrophobic. We couldn't wait to leave.

Prime location, sweet decor, perfect for a mother-daughter trip to Paris. I am a food journalist that travels extensively and my daughter is in the hospitality business. We had a terrible experience at this hotel: extremely loud construction going on right on the very wall of our room. The hotel management was rude and unhelpful about it, one of the worst hotel experiences I have ever had in 40 years of international travel with repeated stays at some of the world's best hotels in Europe and Asia. We came for an overnight from London and checked into one of their better rooms. One minor thing: we had asked for twin beds but the beds were made up as a king. We had to ask twice more, finally it was done while we went to dinner. While unpacking, I heard a bit of knocking but thought it was a minor repair nearby and let it go. We stayed up late and planned to sleep in but were abruptly woken up the next morning by very loud hammering on the wall right next to the beds. This was not some temporary project, this was major work involving jackhammers and other large drilling and hammering equipment. It was still going on hours later. Of course, I called the front desk. I had to insist someone come hear the horrible noise. The woman who arrived was beyond rude, she was yelling at me for complaining and claiming they knew nothing of this problem. The extent of work being done was so obvious that it was ongoing. I had a roaring headache from being woken up too early with such loud noise but it was made worse by the way they responded. They tried to make it seem like it was our fault and pretended that this was the first they had this problem. This was not a language or cultural problem, their English was perfect on this and all other communications and they knew of this construction. As a journalist and lawyer, I know how to investigate things. I did some checking and was able to verify that of course they knew of this major construction going on but in many emails and one international phone call to arrange booking, they never did warn me. Even on checking in, they did not offer us an alternative room. The hotel was not fully booked. Actually, the manager eventually admitted this problem was going on for months. Which probably explains their consternation but does not excuse their terrible attitude toward the discomfort of their guests. After much discussion they said they could concede a very small discount but they did not lose any money on my visit. Too bad, there is much to like about the hotel but I would not take the risk that this poor management would be guest-friendly and thus can not even recommend a stay there. I have a video made of the sound, which even with a poor microphone on a pocket camera really tells the tale!

Besides some references in travel mags, it was recommended by a family friend who, like myself, had lived in Paris, and by a Parisian family. Unfortunately, it was disappointing. Yes, it's cute, but not cute enough when the negatives and nightly rate come into play. We understand the room-size issue: Paris doesn't dole out huge rooms in general. But these rooms were just tiny for the price being charged, especially coupled with the fact that there are no hotel services. Given this fact, it should be priced slightly better. Duc de Saint Simon is like a B&B (but the breakfast is extra), priced as a 4-star hotel. It is certainly priced below the luxury 5-stars in Paris, but we thought it just lacked the space and amenities to justify even the price it's charging. We stayed in a \"suite\" for 375 euros per night. It was very small, and the sitting room portion of the suite was just enough to fit our bags, while we basically just occupied the bedroom part of the room. It was on the ground floor and exremely dark, with low ceilings that made it feel more cramped. The bathroom, though nicely done, cheery enough, and clean, was also small, with a half-length bathtub that requires that the bather kind of crouch if taking a bath instead of shower. Antique-type furnishings and the bed (two twins made into a king, as typical in Europe), were fine. The breakfast was disappointing and not particularly worth 15 euros. Better can be had elsewhere. The staff are frequently overwhelmed at their tiny reception desk. At one point it was difficult to get change because even three people can take up the whole space. The bellman was brusque. Last thing to mention is that this isn't a secret find: the hotel was occupied nearly entirely by Americans, mostly older couples and women, and it was booked solid. While it has a hide-a-way look to it, it actually can be quite hectic downstairs in the tiny lobby and on the patio. We liked the Hotel Luxembourg Parc much better - it was calmer, with nicer rooms, for about 100 euros less. In the range a step up from both, Hotel Tremoille is only about 75 euros more per night than Duc de Saint Simon's \"suite\" and includes breakfast, has room service, gym, etc., still with the feeling of a small boutique hotel.

But, it is definitely the place for privacy, lovely surroundings and all things french. The rooms are on the small side, but are beautifully decorated. We usually ask for the rooms on the terrace. Nicely appointed baths with fabulous ammenities. The hotel itself feels like a warm home. We've always had attentive and friendly staff, very helpful with reservations and concierge services. The location can't be beat. Just minutes from almost anything you want to do or see. I will admit, if we are in Paris during the warmer months, we stay elsewhere with A/C...yes, we're wimps.

(sans children) at this charming hotel. We stayed in Suite 19 which was stunning in decor and amenities. Both the sitting room and the bedroom had French windows that opened onto a garden. Road noise was virtually nonexistent. We ordered coffee delivered to our room each morning as we relaxed in our hotel robes and read the paper. The staff was amazing. Their restaurant suggestions were excellent as we had unbelievable dining experiences. We suggest that you enjoy an afternoon cocktail in the courtyard before heading up for a nap to restore your energy for an evening of superb gastronomical indulgences. I have been to Paris several times before and this is the only hotel we would stay at due to the rooms, staff, location and ambiance. We do recommend that you opt for a suite.", "Date": "January 10, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "pittsburgh", "Title": "\u201cCharming!\u201d", "Author": "lrfolino", "ReviewID": "UR4108527", "Content": "If you want to stay in a hotel that really has the feeling of Paris, stay at the St. Simon. As soon as you arrive, you will know that you are not at a Hilton or a Marriot. (For example, the keys to all of the rooms were each on big tassels and were simply skeleton keys. Before leaving, you simply hand your key to the receptionist to hold until your return. Very quaint.) The lobby and rooms are beautifully decorated and are IMMACULATE. This is the cleanest hotel I believe we have ever stayed in. Flat screen tv, turndown service, fantastic bed with 500 count sheets, safe -- what more could you ask for? The staff was gracious and willing to do whatever we needed to make our stay a pleasant one. The location is terrific! Just 2 blocks up and you will be on St. Germain -- access to 2 metro lines but within walking distance of just about anywhere.
