The receptionist behind the desk was so friendly and it being Christmas the hotel was beautifully decorated for the holidays. I loved the high ceilings and the crown moldings were spectacular. Because this is an older building there was no elevator, so many stairs to climb not too good for anyone handicapped but of course the first floor is always an option . I loved the oak banister, not so sure about the paintings found them a bit strange and not to my taste. Our room was a bit disappointing as I was expecting one with a gas fireplace although the beds were comfortable and the room most spacious I found it lacked charm but the tickets were free after all. However next visit I will reserve one with a fireplace. We shopped took in The Ogilvy's window downtown Ste Catherine Street always magical, and the Christmas lights around the city were beautiful. The next morning after a good and peaceful night's sleep, we went down for a delicious continental breakfast the best one I ever experienced so much choice not the usual toast and jam. There was a huge selection of everything from cereal, cold cuts, hard boiled eggs, yogurt, cottage cheese with fruit salad, apple turnovers and so much more. The coffee was excellent, we sat in comfortable arm chairs beside the lit fireplace and the room was all tastefully decorated for Christmas.

He then called the restaurant ahead to let them know we were on our way. Orders for extra pillows were delivered on immediately and any questions we had about the area or where to go, what to do etc. were handled very professionally and demonstrated a real knowledge of the area and what was available to us. The breakfast room as many before me described, is in a typical European style, in a room which was clean, quiet and peaceful. The restaurant is a short walk away from restaurants and shopping. The only time we took a cab was for a trip into the old section of the city because everything else was well within walking distance. There are some great restaurants right on Sherbrooke and the staff keeps a list of some they regularly recommend. The rooms are older, very charming. Ours had a nice little gas fireplace and sitting area. The bathrooms were quite clean and up to date but in keeping with the hotel style. If you do not like the old Victorian style then this may not be the place for you but we found it quite cozy. The only real thing that I would love to see them change is their bedding. It would be nice to see them lose the old blue bedspreads and move up to a duvet style set up which would be more comfortable and ultimately worlds more hygeinic.

This boutique hotel is carved out of half a block of beautiful stone townhouses, without destroying them. If you're worried about luggage, that's why God created porters. Ours greeted us promptly. \"They have CRT TVs.\" Give me strength. What do you propose to do in Montreal though?. The rooms differ BECAUSE THEY HAVE CHARACTER.

There is an ambiance and charm in this very well kept old hotel. Breakfast was very good and served in the European style with coldcuts, cheeses, croissants, jams, cereal and coffee and team. Try and find that in any American hotel!! We had a junior suite on the second floor that overlooked the hustle and bustle of Sherbrooke. It was grand! We asked for extra towels and got them right away. Situated right on Sherbrooke, close to the Guy metro and within walking distance of Ste Catherines shopping area, the Musee D'Art, McGill & Concordia Universities, and the heart of the English night life on Crescent, Bishop and du Montagne. The subway system (Metro) is extensive and you can get almost anywhere without a car. Our first night we went to Chinatown for the best cantonese food we have ever had (Sorry, NY Chinatown food pales in comparison.) Look for hole in the wall places filled with Chinese people and you won't be disappointed. We also took the Metro to Mont Royal and walked over to St. Denis for dinner, stopping in at SAQ (Societe d' Alcool Quebec) to but a nice chilled bottle of wine ($16) for our dinner at l\"Academie (Duluth and St. Denis. St Denis is at the heart of the \"Latin Quarter\" and is the place to wine, dine, dance and make new friends. (There is nothing Latin about it). From there we attended a terrific concert that was part of the Diverse/Cite festivities. Then we walked back to the hotel via Ste. Catherines.

Everyone was willing to help where they could, and were extremely polite and professional at all times. Now, with that being said, here is my review of the hotel itself. The hotel is in a very old building which I guess adds to it's charm if you're into that sort of thing - I personally am not. We were there during a busy weekend and the only 2 rooms available for booking at the time were either a standard room with a double bed, or for a small extra charge a \"delux\" room with a queen size bed. We opted for the delux room. Upon arrival, we were given a room on the 3rd floor, and as the previous reviews had mentioned, there is no elevator which was not a problem for us. We got to our room, and were shocked to see a run down, TINY hotel room, with orange walls, and two tiny windows barely letting any sunlight in. The carpet was stained, and there were coins under the bed from previous guests. The second night of our stay was when all hell broke loose. We came back from dinner at around 10:00pm, only to enter a sauna of a room. I litterally mean our room felt like it was on fire. We called the front desk, and were instructed to turn the thermostat to the oposite end (the hotter end) since this was an old building. At this point I would have tried anything. Sure enough, the room never cooled down. We went down to the front desk, and they sent someone up to attempt to fix it. They were unable to. We were given a big industrial sized fan, which was SO loud, it interrupted our sleep. Needless to say, we were very uncomfortable that night. Finally the next morning around 11:00am, cold air started coming out again, but our room was never as cool as it was the first night. On our third and final morning there, we were woken up by a loud banging noise in the pipes. We were actually very worried as it sounded like something was about to burst in the wall. Five minutes later there was a knock on the door and a maintnece man came barging in saying he needed to \"fix the washroom.\" He then realized the noise was actually being caused by the washroom upstairs and took off to fix it. Not the most pleasnt thing to wake up to. This is rated as a 4 star hotel, and these instances are simply not acceptable for almost $200 a night. It's a shame because this hotel has 5 star service, but the building itself is old and tattered and really takes away from that. The hotel manager was prompt and efficient in contacting us, and that was very much appreciated. I have no intention of returning to this hotel again unless there are renovations made, and the AC system is updated. Paired with the excellent customer service, upgrades to the hotel would make it top notch.", "Date": "August 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ottawa, Canada", "Title": "\u201cOne of the best of the boutique hotels.\"\u201d", "Author": "PGWbird", "ReviewID": "UR115939500", "Content": "Perhaps one of my favorite things about Quebec, and Montreal in particular, are the boutique hotels. Unlike so many canadian cities that are dominated by chains, you can still find small hotels in Montreal that simply ooze character. The chateau Versailles is that kind of hotel. For about $150 you can spend a night in one of the hotel's lovely rooms - for a little more you can book a suite. I have stayed at the chateau Versailles a number of times and have been well accommodated every time. It is a boutique hotel assembled from three stately houses so the rooms are all different and often bathrooms are small, but the comfort and charm of the place more than compensate. The rooms are generally decorated with a cozy mix of traditional and contemporary furnishings, have minibars and nice amenities ( the crabtree and Evelyn soaps are a treat!). What really makes the stay for me, however, is the warm and very helpful desk staff (take a bow Diane!) and breakfast in the parlor (included in the cost of the room). The mix of pastries and frittatas served with hot coffee amid the hotel's collection of contemporary quebec art is the perfect start to a day of shopping, exploring or business. The location is a huge plus - for tourists the proximity to the metro, the musee de beaux arts, crescent street... What more could you ask for? You are right in the heart of the city and have friends at the desk ready to help you discover all that it has to offer.

I knew the trip would cost a little bit of money so I took a chance and used Priceline.com for the first time in my life and put in a $100 bid. The Chateau Versailles accepted and for weeks, I was agonizing over the decision: will it be close enough to downtown? Will we be away from all the action? We were both astounded at the location- you are only minutes away from Crescent Street and St. Catherine, the two streets that are notorious if you want to have a good time...and trust me they live up to their reputation. You are also a 2 minute walk from the Guy-Concordia Metro as well. Yes, you do have to pay for parking- but we didn't use the hotel parking lot, instead we used the parking lot just up the street from the Hotel (it's across from the Regency and overlooks a football field) and we only paid $12 a night. I thought it was a great and safe parking lot- I drive a 2006 Toyota Rav4 and the car was just as good as I left it. We stayed in Room 122 where we received a standard bed which was comfortable enough for two people to sleep in. The whole hotel has a very romantic atmosphere which makes the stay very enjoyable. Let's just say this: it's the only hotel I've stayed in that provided an intimacy kit. We were right next to the exercise room and saunas but we were so busy with our weekend that we did not get a chance to use it. As a young couple who likes to have a good night out, we arrived during the last 20 minutes of the free continental breakfast and were still served well. You will find cottage cheese, yogurt, croissants, chocolate croissants, cereal, granola, assorted cheeses (including my favorite- brie!), cold cuts, bread, wonderful fruit juices, and very fresh fruit- my partner and I take our fruit very seriously (we're dorks) and those had to be some of the best apples I've tasted. The coffee isn't that bad either! Now- I've got to say- the staff was incredible. Stephanie made us feel so welcome and was full of suggestions about where to go out in the city. Anytime we needed help with anything- places to see in the city, any question with our room- they were so quick to help us. They even let us use the fire exit when we checked out so we could easily take our bikes back to our car! We enjoyed the city of Montreal so much that even hours after we checked out and realized we forgot to print out directions back home (word to the wise: Verizon will charge you like crazy if you attempt to use your smartphone data plan outside the US, so you can't rely on your GoogleMaps app), Stephanie let us go back into the hotel's computer lab so we could print out directions back home. I've got to say- I don't know when I will be back in Montreal (I hope it's soon though!) but I would definitely stay in the Chateau Versailles again.

I didn't actually realize until after we arrived that the hotel is apparently owned by Le Meridian. The hotel itself is quite charming - when you walk up to it from the street it has kind of an old world charm and a staircase leading up to the front door. The lobby is small but the hotel itself isn't terribly large so that's not unexpected. It actually looks more like a bed and breakfast than a hotel owned by a large conglomerate - a fact I personally liked. The decor made me think more of someone's comfortable home than a hotel. The hotel staffer who greeted us was very accomodating, offering suggestions on places to eat, sights to see, etc. There isn't a concierge but the front desk staff does the job. All of the staff I encountered spoke both English and French quite well (thank goodness because my french isn't exactly oustanding!). The hotel is 4 floors but....it has no elevator. The front desk staff offered to have someone help us up the stairs but we opted to do it ourselves since there we were only on the 4th floor (the lobby is actually on the second floor so it was only two flights). When we first arrived I thought the stairs wouldn't be a big deal and they weren't a problem per say but I have to admit that after walking around Montreal all day in the hot sun, I was tired at the end of the day and wishing for an elevator (but goodness knows I need the exercise). The room itself was nice - painted a warm orange with tasteful decorations and art. We had a queen size bed; the bathroom had a shower/tub combo and was lighty and airy feeling. Our room had a window overlooking the street but noise wasn't really a problem. The curtains were 'blackout' curtains but we did still find the room was a little bright in the mornings when the sun came out, even with closed curtains. If you are affected by light, I'd recommend bringing a sleep mask. The room had a safe, mini bar, the standards. The room also had a TV with local channels and move purchase options. The room did have air conditioning but I found it to still be a little warm, even on the coolest setting. It wasn't unbearable by any means but I did notice it at times. This could have been also because we were on the top floor - and the city was quite hot (in the 80's) the whole time we were there. There is no room service but there is a very good buffet style breakfast served every morning. It had frittatta, boiled eggs, assorted meats and cheeses, fruit, yogurt, croissants and other pastries, tea, coffee, juice, etc. The buffet comes with every room, per the front desk staff, so that's a nice plus in an expensive city. The hotel is situated right in downtown so it's very convenient for getting to everything. There are a number of restaurants and bistros in the area, plus there are two convenience stores within two blocks. The Guy-Concordia Metro station is two blocks away so that's the best stop to use for this hotel if you are taking public transport. The hotel offers free internet but there is also a computer and printer on the main floor if you don't bring a laptop.

The bathroom was small, very little counter space, and the shower was very difficult to adjust; i.e. scalding hot or freezing cold. But, with fine adjustments you are able to find an appropriate temperature. The hotel is very quiet and the beds were clean and comfortable. Definitely paid for a larger room because I saw one of the rooms being cleaned and the width of the room was just wide enough to accommodate a queen size bed. In addition, we overheard two sets of couples who booked on a hotel booking website requesting a room with two beds, being a small hotel with 60 rooms and having very few rooms with two beds, the hotel was not able to accommodate their request. We were travelling with a toddler who sometimes napped in the afternoon. We asked the front desk to let housekeeping know we were heading out for the morning and to clean the room. We appreciated that our room was cleaned right away which allowed us great flexibility in planning our afternoons; i.e. nap or sight-see. The air-conditioner in our room only cooled half the room. I overheard the front desk dealing with an air conditioner problem in a room that wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t working properly which leads me to believe there are some rooms that have wonky air conditioner as mentioned in other posts.

I would not let this discourage you. I am 6 months pregnant & was able to get around the stairs just fine. We had a standard room with a full size bed & it was just fine. Sure the room isn't huge but it's very typical of what you'll find in any large city (New York, London, etc.).

Upon arrival we were informed our room wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t ready and if we can wait in the lobby. As I sat there waiting I saw housekeeping come and enter a room very close to the lobby. They spent most of their time in the door way of the room and after 5 minutes they informed the front desk they were done but they are waiting for pillows in French which I understand but do not speak. Therefore before they called my husband\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s name to inform us the room was ready but my husband and I knew this semi cleaned room was ours before they called his named due to the fact we are not blind and understood their entire French conversation about the room not being ready on time. We entered and housekeeping told us she will be back with our pillows and finish making the bed, this took about 15 minutes for her to return! We had reservations at the Center Bell for 5:30 and we checked in after 3, so our plan was to take showers and start walking to the Center Bell and forget what just happened. Unfortunately the disappointment continued when I discovered the water pressure in the shower was a joke and the tub was clogged so I took a shower with water above my ankles. Trying to get the right temperature was a mission, either scorching or freezing while playing with the handle until it was a safe temperature. My husband unclogged the disgusting drain so we can at least have a normal shower when we return. We used the wash clothes and towels for drying and one for the floor since our shower curtain was cloth and allowed water to spill onto the marble floor, so we placed 1 of the 2 towels on the floor to avoid slipping. It was oddly colder than usual in Montreal during our visit so we turned up the heat with anticipation of arriving to a warm room upon return. The fireplace is solely for show and will warm you if you sit directly in front of it. The rugs need a shampoo and the walls need some spackle for all the cracks and fresh coat of paint or just wash the hand marks off the walls. D\u00c3\u00a9cor was beautiful but didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t distract me from the noise we heard from the lobby, front desk and the other visitors directly outside smoking under our window! This was a one night stay and I am glad because if we were planning a longer stay there would be no way I would stay here. When we arrived after our night out at 1am not one towel was replaced and the room was still cold. My husband discovered the next morning that the large windows do not fully close and that is why we were cold. The only heated area as I mentioned before was directly in front of the fireplace and the bathroom. I might have considered using the couch cushions and a blanket to sleep on the floor next to the fire place but as I said the rug was very noticeably worn out and filthy as was the couch. We woke up at 9am and got ready for breakfast in the dining area. I wish someone would have told us that cold frittata and slices of turkey is what to expect. There was not much left at 9:30am and no seats. I was greeted by staff who said Bon Jour and I replied Good Morning and without asking he explained we cannot return after we leave and get more food! When he saw the puzzled look on my face he explained that some guests try to eat the FREE breakfast from the time it is served until 11am and laughed while looking around at other guests expecting them to find this funny as well! I smiled and walked away confused wondering why he felt the need to say something like that to me? I feel it is insulting and unnecessary bit of information. For the price I paid for this room compared to the prices I read in these reviews I apparently paid too much and should have gotten my left over cold breakfast delivered to my room which technically was not far from the dining area and lobby so it wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have been a long walk for the staff and the he can properly ensure I wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t going to steal extra free food. After being embarrassed we found two seats and sat down attempting to enjoy what I could and within minutes the same person who told me no second helpings asked if he could take our plates and I felt rushed! Check out was at 12 and we left way earlier because I just didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to sit in a cold room with a TV that should have been a flat screen. The remote control buttons were either dirty or worn out due to how old the TV is. Pictures are deceiving on the website and the people who love this hotel that is wonderful and I guess that only means I need to lower my expectations. Where I come from paying 250 a night gets you a fantastic room in the tri-state area, one that my husband doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to play plumber. It would have also been nice if the front desk told us just about everything is closed on Sunday. The only answers I got as far as activities outside the hotel are maybe this and maybe that, which isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t comforting when you are visiting for the first time. Since we walked in the door I had this sense of an atmosphere that was poorly managed and I felt not mentioning the horrors of my stay would save me the empty I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122M SO SORRY TO HEAR THAT statement which wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t alter my experience!

The room was warm so we cranked up the AC, only to find the room temperature didn't change. We called reception and they sent an engineer who told us we didn't have control over our room temperature... it was controlled by other rooms. We didn't quite understand that, but were offered a different room, which we accepted. The room was a bit smaller, but the AC worked. Our room was on the second floor facing the street. Noise was not a problem. (There is no elevator in the hotel.) Our room had a nice marble bathroom, comfortable queen bed, soothing decor.

Having stayed at other hotels in the past, I was looking forward to staying at the Chateau Versailles for it's \"boutique\" atmosphere. Perhaps my expectations were too high, but I was disappointed overall. Although charming in appearance at first glance, after taking a closer look, I would say the hotel overall looks \"tired\", and could use a bit of a facelift. I was travelling with a sizeable group from my company, and more than a few of us asked to be transferred over to the Meridien hotel across the street after the first night - a request which was fulfilled by the hotel staff. My main reasons for moving were as follows: My room was small and dark. I had requested a king sized bed, ended up getting a double. The bed was very uncomfortable, with a very, very firm mattress that tended to \"pop-up\" on the opposite end, when you sat down on the corner of it. The bed cover was old and worn, and looked dirty. The sheets, blanket and pillows were all reminiscent of a cheaper motel, and not a boutique hotel. There was no full length mirror, and the \"armoire\" in the corner was creaky, cheap looking, and had a door that wouldn't close. By contrast, the bathroom was more or less ok. The shower head and drain were very old and loose, but the rest of the bathroom looked completely new. My main issue with the bathroom was that there was almost no counter space to put any of my things on. A little shelf would have been nice. Since the building is old, there is some noise expected. The floors are creaky, and you could hear everyone walking on the floor above. The common areas of the hotel are quaint, and the breakfast room was lovely, with a very nice continental breakfast served. I didn't have much interaction with the staff, other than when I asked to be moved. They were friendly and efficient in accomplishing that. Interestingly though, they didn't ask me why I wanted to move. I would have thought that the hotel would want to know why someone asks to be moved 1 day into their 4 night stay. The rate my company paid was $170 per night, and I would definitely not come back again at this rate. I believe it is very poor value for that price. If you can get a rate closer to $100 per night, I would say you're getting what you paid for. I will not be staying here again in future. For the same rate, you can get a very comfortable bed at the Meridien across the street or the Delta on Avenue President Kennedy. The sheets feel newer, there is a duvet on the bed, and the rooms are a bit bigger with a desk to work at if you need to.", "Date": "June 20, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto", "Title": "\u201cJ'adore le Chateau.

Our stay at this charming place was a truly wonderful experience. EYES - this is a charming old block of four houses renovated inside to connect the houses into one connected area. The architectural style was beautiful throughout, including the rooms tastefully painted and pleasing to the eyes. The rooms were not large, but our goal was not really to lounge around but rather to spend as much time sight seeing. The bathroom was well appointed and luxuriously clean, although also not very large. There was no elevator, and even though we stayed on the top floor, we did not mind the stairs. We also felt that the carpet needed to be replaced. The break fast was just a fabulous experience: a decent selection of cereals, delicious hams and cheeses, excellent quality jams, pastries, juice and some other items were more than than enough to please the discriminating guest, and to prepare you for the daily \"grind\" of touring the city. EARS - this fantastic breakfast feast was situated in a truly charming little salon (\"Le Boudoir\") where classical music played in the background tastefully accompanying our gastronomic experience. The whole decor and furniture also served the function of maintaining the level of intimacy we could actually \"hear\", adding to the feeling of being constantly pampered. One of the hotel supervisors, M Hom\u00c3\u00a8re Hugo, was there (at our last breakfast) to make us feel more at home by offering some pleasantries with his sincere and friendly manner. As guests, we appreciated and very much enjoyed this personal touch. M Hugo did not only have a pleasant manner, more than that, his way of conversing with us was welcoming, warm, and sincere, rather than conducted in the function of \"doing a job to please guests\". TOUCH - all the hotel staff clearly had one goal in mind, to do whatever is necessary to help us feel welcome and enjoy our stay. We were impressed by their dedication and attention to detail in all situations, from offering advice as to where the \"best \" of something was, to explaining on the ma how to get there, to making a reservation at a local restaurant. When we arrived, went to our room, and noticed a discernible amount of noise from an air conditioning unit, we were offered a choice between two other rooms without a single question or hitch.

To say we have a vast insight to the variety of rooms they offer would be an understatement. Upon checking into what we thought was a smoking room (as requested at booking) we were advised in no uncertain terms that the hotel does not have any smoking rooms and were therefore allocated a non-smoking room. We reluctantly accepted and checked into what was a rather nice boutique style room. The room was pastel in colour, of adequate size and with a funky art deco style bathroom. The next morning i spoke with the very polite and helpful receptionist and asked if in fact there were any smoking rooms - we were advised that yes there were and happily accepted a transfer. (Quite why we were told there were no smoking rooms in the first place by the rather unhelpful girl on the front desk at check in is beyond me). As you can expect we were now happy to indulge in our filfthy habit and settled into our new room (as nice a standard as the previous one) Upon returning to our room after a day exploring Montreal, we were shocked to discover that we could not open our doors. Upon consulation with firstly the front desk and then with the maintenance guys it turned out that the door lock had malfunctioned and we would therefore have to be relocated into the sister hotel (Le Meridien) across the street. After agreeing to do this the hotel then backtracked and advised we would still have to stay in the Chateau versailles and after a half hour delay we were found another room (3rd so far). Although our new room was bigger it had a number of flaws. Firstly the room lacked any kind of daylight, the bathroom was tiny and more importantly the room was as hot as hell!. Unusually for this time of year Montreal happened to be really warm that weekend (23c) and trying to sleep in this sweat box became unbearable so much so the next morning we complained to the front desk. Luckily for us the nicer of the ladies on reception happened to be there and offered to find us yet another room. As you can imagine we were now becoming a little stressed out and frustrated with the sorry chain of events. To our delight, however we were immediately offered a free upgrade to one of the hotels suites (smoking also). This went some way to making up for all the problems we had had so far. The suite itself was beautiful - massive in size with spacious living and bedrooms areas and topped off with a jacuzzi. It was a bit of a shame as the hotel itself was really nice, with (on the whole) good service, nice rooms, an ample free breakfast and a good location. If it wasnt for the chain of events i would be considering a 4-5 rating.

The rooms were well heated, ideal for those Montreal cold nights. Breakfast was probably the weakest aspect of this hotel, as the selection wasn't huge but what they had tasted delicious. Boiled eggs, two types of bread, sponge cake, croissant, pain au chocolat, cheese cubes, peanut butter, jam, chopped fruit (most of it from the can) orange juice (fresh), tea and coffee... that was about it,... Also, here's a tip, if you book their superior rooms through their 'shopping package' it works cheaper than booking a standard room and they rooms are much nicer.

I found the personal reviews of this hotel to be invaluable and hope our experience will help others. The hotel was very nice and what I expected. Very quiet, out of the busy hotel sections, but close to so much! It was clean, no offensive odors, and nicely decorated. Our room was a little small, but that's more because we booked at the last minute and didn't want to pay a lot. I know there were other rooms that were much more spacious. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. Our pillows were a bit lofty, but we both fell asleep no problem. The breakfast the next morning was excellent! Everything from fruit to some hard boiled eggs! It was great! Loved the bathrobes too! We had a little situation with the Valet parking, but they were very accommodating and offered a great solution. You see, our driver side window button broke a few days before our trip. With no time to get it fixed, we taped the button in a \"locked\" position, but if you happened to hit the button the window would go down, but not back up. Well we forgot to tell them about that...kinda figured they'd see the piece of tape on the button and figure it out. Anyway, they unrolled the window to enter the parking garage, but then couldn't get the window back up. Not too secure huh? When we returned from dinner, they told us what happened. They offered to move our car out of the garage and into their own lot next to the security camera and watch it all night for us. So there our car sat, window down all night under the watchful eye of the camera and staff member. It was a great solution. The next morning my husband and a staff member were able to get the window back up, but they also took off the valet parking fee! That was totally unexpected since it really wasn't their fault. How were they to know?! We ate at 2 restaurants that I wanted to comment about. Moiser's on St. Laurent. The concierge at Le Meridan suggested it for meat lovers. It's a very, very expensive steakhouse. There were many locals, many families, 3 renditions of Happy Birthday and children. If you don't want to be around kids, because you left them at home, like we did :) , this may not be the right place. Everything is a la carte, so a meal for 2 without drinks was $140. We split a plate of asparagus and you could easily do that too. Also, there was not much style there. My plate arrived with a hunk of meat on it. Nothing else. I was not impressed. We should have looked at the menu before being seated. The other restaurant was Stash's in Old Montreal. Wonderful Polish food, very talented piano player if you happen to catch him, and great atmosphere. A little more reasonable...$68 with drinks! We also found a great place to park in Old Montreal for free! Yes, free on Sat and Sunday only. It was on Rue St. Henri. If the river is at your back, the street is way to the left. It was great to park there and walk around all day in Old Montreal. And yes, the window was up!

Only recently did I discover tripadvisor website. We found a special on the internet which we paid $99 American dollars a night. I was quick to book this room since the hotel website was considerably more expensive. I guess the adage 'you get what you pay for' was applicable to our stay.

All was done very tastefully with nice lighting and carpet. Upon opening the door to our room I was impressed by the large size of the room and the elegant decor. However, our windows were up high like the basement of my parent's split level home.

Excellent location which puts you in the heart of everything, , despite facing the street, rooms were quiet and I never heard noise from any other rooms. Nice breakfast. Negatives: Well there was the basement factor which was dark and distracted from many of the luxuries i.e. nice, high quality decor. Staff was friendly but not terribly helpful. Whenever we would ask a question so simple as directions to a restaurant, the staff would inform us that we needed to speak with concierge across the street at Hotel Versialles.
