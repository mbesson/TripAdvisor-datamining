(I wouldn't bother to look at Tripadvisor for reviews of a Travelodge as we have stayed in lots of them in town or city centres, on motorway service stations and along main routes. I trusted the brand and thought I knew what to expect. Many leave a lot to be desired but you know you are not paying for The Ritz.) Our impressions are not influenced by these reviews but are our own findings. This Travelodge is GRIM. We normally take the train to London and stay centrally but this time we were driving. We chose this Travelodge because it was easy to find, close to a tube station and had parking. Yes, it was also cheap. The photo on the website does not do justice to the outside of the building which is incredibly shabby. It makes little difference whether you enter by the front door, flanked by a pair of planters filled with fag ends and vomit or the back door next to the delapidated shed containing rubbish bins and a broken bed. Trust instead the reviewers photos and comments. Add to this dirty lifts, rucked up carpets held together with gaffer tape,water stained ceilings, traffic noise and the smell from food factories front and back. This is what you can expect at Wembley. Being early and unable to check in we drove around to check out the local area where England welcomes the world to the jewel in the crown of association football. We concluded that it had no redeeming features. We drove back & paid to park at the hotel, walked through the intimidating, rubbish strewn wasteland to Stonebridge Park tube station and spent the afternoon in the West End. Upon returning that night we were apprehensive about what we would find inside. Our room was clean (apart from the windows which were filthy despite being on the 5th floor) but worn. Housekeeping was adequate, 2 lights had no bulbs, the TV remote didn't work and the sink had no plug.These are minor faults that management can influence compared to the bigger job that is the general state of the building, which is down to the company itself. Our room was at the front so the traffic noise is intrusive but only to be expected. On the positive side, our fellow guests were quiet and there were no crying babies or rowdy drinkers. Or maybe we just couldn't hear them. In view of the neighbourhood, we left the car in the car park for the 2 days of our stay and spent the entire time in Central London. \u00a35 per day is not a lot to pay when on street parking off Wembley high street was \u00a31.50 for 40 minutes but we would have been very concerned had we seen the pictures of smashed car windows beforehand. Although we had planned to spend the rest of today in London we checked out at 9.30. The receptionist who, like all the staff we spoke to, was helpful and friendly. Despite the fact that he must have received negative feedback many times before, he actually asked if everything had been alright during our stay!!!! We couldn't wait to get on that North Circular Road and head out of London.

On approach I noticed the huge ugly steam spewing factory across the road, as we arrived into the parking lot I noticed that directly behind the hotel was another horrendous 80s built and forgotten about factory with the very same name as the one I had just seen, What a great idea, build a Travelodge right in the middle the smell will hit and cling to the building on both sides !! The Entrance to the hotel or doss house it would be more aptly named was dirty, surely mops and buckets dont cost that much in Wembley! You have to pass one of the corridors on your way to Reception, the carpet that runs the length of the corridor had never been introduced to a hoover in its life, Im pretty sure the flee bitten thing is about to walk to the nearest skip by itself. Reception were friendly enough and announced that we should be staying on the 4th floor. So we thanked them for the 60 seconds of their time and allowed them to get back to doing the crossword or whatever it was they were doing before we arrived. As we waited patiently inline for the lift (only 1 of the 2 working, need i bother telling you and I have waited less time at theme parks for the rollercoaster) I noticed that all the other guests in the queue were male, i then realised that they were all workmen and thought it odd that with so many workmen around the place was clearly in such disrepair, (a lick of paint once a decade would certainly be an improvement) however it certainly explained why the carpets were full of cement and dirt from their dirty boots, then i realised as we all trotted along the corridor and many of them staggering that they were in fact guests of the hovel. Trying to keep our spirits up we opened the door to the room took a deep breath, and to my deepest joy and i nearly wept the bed was nice and clean, the bathroom acceptable and oh what luxury there was tea and coffee making facilities. But wait there was a great big hole on the bathroom door that had been patched up by someone whos motto must be \"Slap Dash earns the cash\" same guy had filled in the many holes in the walls. The ceiling was decorated by what I guess must have been a glass of red wine flung with some abandon upwards and left there to dry in. We dumped our stuff and headed back down stairs to enquire about internet and the nearest petrol station. We were met with a whole flock of work men, who were talking gingerly to their work mates who must have been given the day off and had spent their weeks wages in the pub. We were there for 30 minutes and it was like a YMCA men coming and going, Brining in their Asda shopping(I didnt realise Travelodge has the option of self catering) making phone calls back home to their wives just to keep up the weekly tradition of arguing. Others on their laptops the rest just supping their drinks and staring into their glass. I was the only female I saw the entire time. We paid 25 pound so we weren't expecting the Ritz, but we didn't want the YMCA either. Oh and did I mention that we had to pay for the parking in the hotels very own car park 5 quid for the pleasure.

As I was staying on my own, they asked if a twin room would be OK (as they were short of double rooms) - it didn't bother me at all. I had a really comfortable sleep, the bedroom was fine. This is one of the older Travelodges, so the bathroom wasn't as modern as some of the newer hotels (e.g. City Airport, or the brand spanking new Whetstone & Cricklewood hotels).

For the saver price (\u00a319-\u00a322), I personally think this hotel was worth it, as you probably wouldn't even get a backpacker hostel bunk bed in London, for cheaper than this.

Although the hotel was easy to get to by overground train (from Euston to Stonebridge Park), as a lone female I was a bit scared of having to walk, after dark, in the Wembley area, under 3 or 4 railway bridges, to get from the station to the hotel.

You could probably get a bus from the other end of the road, from Hangar Lane station?

Reading the reviews I imagined it to be a poor standard but because it had a carpark and easy to get to from where I\u2019m located I thought I\u2019d go for it. Now from where I live up the M1 it was easy to get to so that\u2019s a big plus. The \u2018secure\u2019 carpark is \u00a35 daily and it pay and display. Doesn\u2019t seem overly inforced by anyone though onsite so leeway I imagine is used if you are over you time. The carpark is not locked, it has a barrier but it looks like it has been broken off. The gate so you can not enter the \u2018grounds\u2019 is also never locked. I would advise if parking in the \u2018grounds\u2019 park as close the the major entrance as you can or something you can see from the bedroom. You can test your luck and park on the Rd, although I saw afew cars broke in there over the last 3 nights I was around the area, So I wouldn\u2019t do it for sake of a fiver. The hotel is VERY basic. The staff are fine never had a problem with dealing with them face to face. Now the rooms are basic, if you get a room on the back side facing the river then its pretty quiet. The front of the hotel though is very noisy. Most rooms on the back will look out on Wembley. My room was cold, one little storage heater simply wasn\u2019t enough. One pillow was supplied only. The shower was nice but the toilet didn\u2019t flush too well and the sink when emptying with water which took along time smelt very very bad, worse then a toilet would smell in a bad situation. Towels were also in short supply. 3 days past and non were given out. In the end had to get some from reception. The card entry to the room is a joke as it doesn\u2019t work for longer then 20 minutes normally. So make sure you go to reception and get the room card redone when you arrive back in the hotel, they blame it on mobile phones being next to the card but this isn\u2019t true as the card wouldn\u2019t work within 20 minutes which within it was nowhere near anything else. The general feeling is the hotel is worn. Have been told its getting a big refurbish but I imagine it will lose a lot of custom before then. Location wise its between Stonebridge and HangerLane. Both are between a 12 \u2013 17 minute walk with Stonebridge being a left turn out of the hotel and then follow the road. You go under several rail bridges but this never felt unsafe as there was always other people about. Hanger Lane is abit of a harder walk.

On arrival in the room I had to repair the curtains as one was hanging off, one half of the shower enclosure was completely missing so a shower ended with water all over the floor, the sink was blocked and more water leaked out of the back of the shower than came through the shower head. I went out for the evening and asked for the sink to be unblocked, on arriving back it was still blocked but 2 towels had been taken - bizarre! Breakfast was poor, orange'juice' that was water with the faintest hint of orange flavour - I didn't touch the buffet but my colleague was less than impressed. On the upside...comparatively low cost and the room itself was clean even if the general areas weren't, nearest tube - 7 minute walk and 30mins right into the centre of London.

I knew the location of the hotel which was on the North Circular Road so this was not a suprise, the only good thing about the hotel is that there was no noise up on the 3rd floor where I was staying but other than that the stay was a huge dissappointment. The Receptionist on shift that checked me in was very polite... her name was Dimples and she was from India. She received me in a courteous manner, chatted a bit and wished me a good stay. Then when I got to the lift area there were 2 lifts, one out of order and second one that was on the 3rd floor. So I waited for it, at first I was alone but soon I was joined by 2 maids that were deep engaged in conversation in a foreign language, probably Polish but I can not be entirely sure. Even though I did say Good Afternoon to them I received no reply. When the lift opened up it was full of other maids and a laundry trolley/basket, the maids that were waiting for the lift with me jumped in and left me waiting for the lift to return as there was no space for myself and my 1 piece of hand luggage. I waited for a while and decided to take the stairs. The staircase was far from a hotel staircase that is open to public even though there was a big sign indicating where they were. The staircase was made red steel and there was a smell of chemicals in the air. When I reached the room I could see that the main door must have been broken in at some point in the past and never was fixed as I could see the door frame with splinters sticking out just next to the lock and handle. The bathroom door had some holes in it that had been covered up with a white/yellow paste and was never repainted. The bathroom seemed clean and there were 2 half used toilet paper rolls. The room seemed clean, and spacious, we had booked a Family room for 3 and it seemed okish. The 3 pillows however where paper thin (when in Edinburgh the pillows where full and round and soooo comfortable I thought that thas was there standards, I was wrong!). So I thought, lets go down and let Dimples know I would need more pillows, I jumped into the lift, yipee and asked Dimples if she could keep a few spare pillows that I would pick up in the night to take to the room but she offered to place them in the room if she found some, so that was a nice extra touch. In the evening I returned with my family and as soon as I got into the hotel I noticed a very strong smell of air freshner that was certainly not healthy for someone with Asthma like my mum who needed to reach for her inhaler. When we got to the room I found out that indeed they had left us another 2 paper thin pillows. The next morning we went out for the day and when we got back our key card was deactivated so I had to go down to activate it again, then when we got to the room we saw that they had changed our towels but nothing else was done, not even emptied our bins which were full. The following day we were getting ready at 9.30am and housekeeping started knocking on our door to service the room, we asked for them to return in 15 minutes and all were literally forced to take the towels into the room. In the evening the key card was not working again, even though it was in my bag where no mobile phone was kept and once in the room again no service was done, not even the old towels were removed or toilet paper replaced, which was needed. The same situation happened the following day and my family was even told that they were due to check out and to please leave the room, but only to find out that they had make a mistake. One of the evenings we asked the receptionist if we could please print of an important document as we had an appointment at the Embassy in the morning and we had been unable to print off from Ryman (printer out of order) and then from the internet caf\u00e9 in Ealing (same reason) but we were told they could not insert any USB stick into their computers, so we asked if they could print it off from e-mail and they said they only had access to their intranet so we asked if we could send it to their work e-mail and they said they needed approval from their managar that was only going to be there at 9am, and our appointment was at 9.30 am at Holland Park so we would never have been able to make it. So no... I would NEVER reccommend this hotel, horrible service, no interest in helping guests whatsoever, one of the lifts remained ouf of service for the entire stay and there was not even a sign there to apologize. I can not believe the difference between this Travelodge and the one I stayed in Edinburgh, the one in Edinburgh was a place I would go back anytime and have recommended to everyone I know that was travelling there.

Initially the reviews did give us some concern however for one night stay we thought it was worth the risk as all the other local hotels were considerably more expensive. The hotel is very worn out and basic but clean which is all we wanted. Its located 10 min walk to Stonebridge Park tube station and a 40min walk to Wembley Stadium. A tip is if you turn left as you leave the hotel and walk for ten minutes, thsi should take you to Stonebridge Park Station and if you do the same to the right, this should take you to Hanger Lane Station which is a bit longer than 10 minutes. There is a bus stop right outside the hotel and we believe that when events are on all buses take a detour to Wembley from this stop which is handy. Rooms don't have an iron but can be asked for at reception. Rooms have tea making facilities but the road facing rooms can be quite noisy. All staff were extremely helpful, friendly and efficient. Hotel bar is reasonably priced and breakfast was standard but good. However the bar tables and chairs have seen better days so be careful. The only down side it that the area didn't appear to have many local bars or restaurants near by so when the hotel stops serving food your options are very limited if you require a late night snack. The car park appeared safe enough and priced at \u00a35 for 24hrs. All in all this is a good place to stop for Wembley events for a single night but for anylonger and if you can spare a few more pennies I would suggested opting for a closer hotel.

The first thing I would say is the number of \"terrible\" reviews is not really justified. The hotel isnt fantastic, but some of the things people have complained about seem very picky to me. Some of the carpets have seen better days, but I never noticed any bad smells, and they seemed clean enough. We had a double room and a twin room - the double was a lot nicer than the twin which had a couple of light bulbs missing and a crack in the bathroom sink. They could have both done with a little bit of patching up here and there, but for a hotel on the edge of London, for the price I am sure there are worse places. I have to say that the staff were friendly and helpful, but I wasnt happy about having to pay an extra \u00a310 to check in at 2pm rather than 3pm - surely if the room is already ready it would be much better customer service to just let you have it. I am not sure if this is the same with all Travelodges as this was our first stay in one. I was also surprised by a couple of reviews saying the area didnt fell safe. Myself, my wife and our two kids walked from the tube station at Hanger Lane between 11 and 11.30pm after a night at the theatre, and had no problems whatsoever. One thing I would say though is, unless I went completely the wrong way, it is not only a 10 minute walk as one reviewer said - I think Mo Farah would struggle to get there in 10 mins. I think 20-25 mins is more realistic, but its not too bad. The breakfast, which is served up to 12noon is certainly worth the money. It is a buffet style that is constantly topped up. The one main downside to the hotel is something that they cannot do anything about - its proximity to the North Circular. Where do people drive to at 3 or 4 o'clock in the morning?? its just a constant noise. There is no way I would stay here in the summer with a chance I might have to have the window open as sleep would be impossible - it would be like sleeping on the central reservation of the M1!!

The car park looks like something left over from the Cold War and the front of the building could be a prison with the barbed wire, high fences and concrete walls. Despite being fully booked, we managed to park easily although they charge you \u00a35 per vehicle for 24hrs which seems somewhat outrageous! There is a cafe/bar here, and the stench of stale cooking oil and grease that emanates from it out into the carpark is appalling. Empty beer kegs were stacked up by the wall. On entering, my heart lifted slightly as the entrance was clean and tidy. The bar is reasonably stocked with alcoholic drinks of your choice and there is a wall with a number of vending machines - one for water, one for cans of fizzy pop and two more for snacks and the essentials that you may forget like a toothbrush or toothpaste. Check in was straight forward albeit that the two rooms which were on the same booking were inexplicably split so that one was on the first floor and the other on the fourth. In to the lift (clean enough on first inspection but the floor is actually in serious need of a scrub on hands and knees - not a swab with a mop) and up we went. The door popped open on the first floor to let some people out and the stench of stale, rotting carpet and furniture was atrocious. It smelt to me like there was a hot water leak somewhere (although that may actually have been because the whole place was overheated) which had permeated the carpets throughout the hallways and was now rotting the fixtures and fittings from the inside out. It was appalling. We carried on up to the fourth floor where the door opened to a normal clean-smelling hallway. Phew. The room was typically Travelodge basic, which was perfectly normal and acceptable. The bathroom was reasonably clean, but there was water damage across the ceiling from a recent looking leak. A clean single duvet on each bed and a solitary pillow about as thick as the palm of your hand. A card in the room said to ask at reception if you wanted another pillow. Other than that, it was generally fine. The temperature, however, was awful. The heating was off, but it was so stuffy that it was not bearable. The window only cracks open about two inches - no doubt to stop you throwing yourself out of it - so a breath of fresh air was impossible. The hotel is of course right on the Northern Circular, which essentially means a motorway passing about 20 yards from the windows. We knew about this and had brought earplugs in preparation, but you couldn't leave the window open to sleep. We left the window open as wide as we could (hardly at all!) and went out for the evening. On our return, I asked at reception for a round of four pillows (one each) but was told that the hotel was fully booked so they had none left. I don't really care whether or not they are fully booked - they should have sufficient bedding for each room. I then tried to get a bottle of water from the vending machine - completely empty. The bar do not sell soft drinks except as mixers. My only option for a soft drink was to pay \u00a31 for a can of diet coke from another machine, which was lukewarm. My colleague then asked to buy a toothbrush as she'd forgotten hers and was directed to another machine. It was also empty. On asking again at reception, she was met with shrugs. On asking who was responsible for filling the machines, they shrugged again. A staff member then retrieved a packet of peanut M&M's and gave them to her by way of apology for being out of pillows, water and toothbrushes. It was a nice gesture, I'm sure, but I cannot see how it remotely related to the issues we had at that point! On going to the first floor in the morning to collect our colleagues on the way out, I was appalled to see the volume of wanton damage that has not been repaired and lack of care and attention by the hotel management. There were a number of fires that had been set at some point, up against doors and walls, damaging both the doors and the carpets. There were horrific looking stains on the carpets that could have been either vomit or faeces, judging by the colours. The carpets were lifting up and are filthy - I suspect that the water damage you can smell is linked to the carpets moving around like hair in a Timotei advert. The Ace Cafe (of motorbike fame) is a few minutes walk away and well worth a visit in my opinion! Stonebridge Park tube and railway station is about fifteen minutes on foot from the hotel and the Bakerloo Line will take you straight into the city centre in 29 minutes. I will be writing to the hotel management to complain, and more or less C&P'ing my review in the letter. The brand has a reasonably good reputation for good, basic, clean, standardised facilities. I've stayed in \u00a36/night B&B's in Sri Lanka with considerably better quality, fewer stinks and better service.

However it was too late for us to change. When I arrived my fears to an extent were confirmed; the entrance and the one working lift was poor and when I went to the room I found that there was nowhere to hang clothes as the rails were missing, graffiti on the bathroom door, a taped over broken plug and most importantly a sofa bed which was to be used by my two grandchildren was not very clean and the bottom bed was missing. I immediately went to reception and spoke initially to the receptionist and then to the Hotel Manager. Initially they wanted us to change rooms but I didn\u2019t want to do this as it would separate us from my daughter and son in law and, as we had a room at the back of the hotel away from the traffic noise, there would be a risk on having a room at the front. We asked for z beds or simply a clean mattress to be placed on the floor and hotel manager said she would try to ensure that this was arranged. We then left to attend a wedding. 3 hours later we returned to check on progress and found to our satisfaction that 2 z-beds had been placed in the room. Contrary to many comments that we had read we found the staff that we came into contact with extremely helpful and they solved our problem. I think we had one of the better rooms judging by comments from some others in our party. The hotel is clearly not up to Travelodge standards and it needs a complete refurbishment. It is not in a good location \u2013 it is a run down industrial area right beside the North Circular road and therefore the front side of the hotel is subject to continual noise from traffic. It is also very hot \u2013 it is one of those buildings that holds the heat. However I found the staff to be excellent.

A bit naively I thought all hotels in Wembley would be expensive due to the concert and high demand for rooms. I thought great I've booked a room and didn't look at reviews before booking:o( Just relieved that I had managed to book a room and wouldn't have to drive back to Bournemouth late at night. I sooo wish that we had done just that and driven straight home. Having booked the hotel room this was supposed to be an added treat and a break away with the prospect of a peaceful night sleep and an overdue lie in...... It was a hot day and in the main reception area there was air conditioning and nothing to make us doubt the hotel. However as soon as we got in the lift and went up to the 3rd floor the heat coming out the lift into our corridor was overwhelming. I thought we were in Spain. We found our room and went in to find room was unbearably hot and so noisy. Catch twenty two, did we open the window which was filthy and at the front of the building overlooking 'motorway' and put up with the horrendous noise or shut it and feel sick with the heat. Oh and the curtain wasn't even hooked properly. No hairdryers... apparently they get nicked. 1 towel each. 1'slim' pillow. My bedside light fitting fell off when I switched it on to read. Missing lights on the wall. Soggy carpets. Pubic hairs in bathroom .Suspicious marks on the walls and ceilings??? However we went to our concert which thankfully was amazing. On return we both had a cool shower as was still soooo hot in the room (was 1am) and tried to relax to go to sleep. NO CHANCE!!!!!! The traffic noise was terrible (windows open in desperation!) 3.30am I was on tripadvisor on my moblie phone thinking, is it me am I being unreasonable. Definitely not, in fact reading the reviews on here made me more nervous and just reinforced my horrible gut feeling of the place.Cars being broken into and hotel doors being forced open was not light reading.I went down to reception in my pj's to ask for a fan and complain. NOTHING, the guy just wasn't interested. Thankfully in the morning we checked out and we couldn't do that fast enough, we complained again at the check out desk and a lovely receptionist just said she was sorry and that was that. I couldn't blame her personally but the hotel is a shambles. Someone has to take responsibilty. How can they carry on operating like this??? Our friends on the 7th floor had same problems as us and on top had the room next to theirs emptied because of 'BED BUGS' during the night. (Hotel staff had tried to open their door at 2am by mistake). Still we should be greatful because our car wasn't broken into and we left in one piece and got out of there!!!!!!!!

I went back to reception to advise, and the reception person offered me a room on the 7th floor. I asked if it was away from the road, on the back of the property and he said \"no but its fine\". Fine for who? in any case, i went to the room. After i arrived upstairs (one lift not working so took around 5 mins to wait), the road noise was still intrusive. I was in a rush to get out of the hotel at this point since i had arranged a meeting, so left the room and thought i would \"make do\". The next morning, i had arranged to check out of the hotel at 12 noon, so woke up at 11. I went to take a shower, and low and behold, there was no hot water. I left the shower running for a while, and still nothing. At 11.15 there was a knock at the door, \"housekeeping!\". I opened the door and the cleaning lady asked me \" what time is checkout?\". I said \"you work here, and you do not know what time check out is?\". She shook her head. I said \"12 o clock\". I then said there is no hot water, and she said \"sorry go to reception\". Deciding not to take the 7 minute trip downstairs, i thought i would complain at checkout. I was obviously running out of time before checkout so packed my things and left. The man at reception asked me if my stay was ok, and i said no. He didnt bother to ask me why. To say i am amazed as to how this hotel is run is an understatement. I had even asked for change at the bar, for the car park, and the person said there was no change available for parking. The sheer dilapidations and lack of concern for guests is crazy.

On arrival check in was quick and easy although we did need to go down to reception to 'update' our key card everyday. We stayed for 3 nights and towels and bedding was changed, bins emptied daily. Overall the room was clean other than a few small things down to hotel needing updating. Car park appears to be safe (although we parked at the front of the hotel to keep an eye out!)

Leaving the tube station you're hit by a depressing industrial area, and pass a biker cafe which never has less than 40 or so bikers hanging around outside which is intimidating to say the least. The hotel itself is fenced in like a prison and uninviting. Checking in took a good 20 minutes as there was a queue - 3 staff we at the desk but only one was bothering to check anyone in. After finally checking in we took the lift (which felt like it was about to break down as we arrived on our floor - expected the doors to open with the floor at chin level!) to our floor. The key card didn't work. We went downstairs to complain and they simply took the key and re-activated it without saying a word! The key continued to stop working EVERY day we stayed there, and each time the staff were unhelpful. I suggested that perhaps there was a problem with the door and was completely ignored! Our room smelt like smoke, with the smell coming from behind the bed. We assumed it was the room next door, however when we left for work the next morning, we realised that the 'room' next door was actually a cleaner's store room. Clearly the staff ar exempt from the smoking ban in this hotel. We left the 'do not disturb' sign on the door each day when we were out as we did not trust the staff not to steal our belongings while we were at work. Being so close to the north circular, the noise is constant. After a while you do stop noticing it, but light sleepers would not get on well here. Especially as the mattresses are solid and only 2 thin pillows are provided. When we asked for more we were told that there were none and that if they found some they would send them up. We never received any. On top of this, the hotel is a good 15 minute walk from any shops and the route to them is not one that I would walk alone, especially not in the dark. Fortunately we stayed in summer with the light mornings and evenings, if we'd stayed in the autumn/winter it would have been even more of a disaster. The room was a good size (but not the biggest), and if you were only here for one night, arrived late and left early it would probably be bareable... the curtains were hanging off the wall and the lights continually turned themselves off.

We wanted something that was not too expensive and close to the Stadium and surrounding bars. We paid \u00a336 for one night\u2019s stay, this worked out to be the cheapest of all the hotels in Wembley, however not the closest by far. According to their site the hotel is 1 mile away from the stadium which is possibly correct if travelling in a straight line, however in-between the hotel and Wembley is a train line that of course you can\u2019t cross, so to get there you have to go up along the North Circular road and then go under the tracks and then back track on yourself, possibly adding an extra mile, so if you\u2019re walking which we did it take aprox 30 - 45 min. The hotel have however got a set fare deal with a local Taxi company at \u00a38, they are pretty reliable as well normally there in about 5 mins of you calling. The hotel is right next to the North Circular road so is really easy to find but be warned there is nothing around it, it\u2019s in the middle of an industrial estate. The hotel its self in real need of updating, the corridor floors where old and tired, the grouting in the tiles dirty and one of the lifts out of order, however the room we stayed in 110 Family room was very big and clean. The shower was hot and powerful and the bed\u2019s where comfortable, again though a new lick of paint would not go a miss. There was plenty of tea and coffee available in the room and of course a kettle for making it, TV and towels where also available. One thing that was not in the room however was a telephone to call reception, so when I wanted an extra blanket I had to walk down to ask, which they gave with no issues, however it would have been better to have called down. The breakfast is not included in the price and costs \u00a37.65 per person, 6.65 if you book in advance, however 15 and under get it free, they have a great selection available, Bacon, sausage, beans, egg, tomatoes, cereal, toast, tea and coffee etc, and it\u2019s all help yourself and you can eat as much as you like, as we had a long drive back to Whitley Bay we decided to fill our boots. One other thing is parking, it is available at \u00a35 for 24 hours, however the main street just outside has no parking restrictions and its pretty safe to park there, however space is limited so get you space early. I would stay here again however not if am going to Wembley stadium due to the distance away, but overall it\u2019s a good place and come recommended.

Bed was not the comfiest, but ok. Bathroom was shower only but for one night it served the need. The rooms were not too noisy either, considering where the hotel is located. Bar - We did not have food here so can't comment. There was a few drinks on tap and bottles etc. Typical inflated hotel prices, but I think that speaks the same of the majority of hotels.

The receptionist didn't have a clue what he was doing, did not use any common sense (we arrived 20 mins before the check-in, the room was ready and we had to pay \u00a310 to get into our room or wait, other Travelodges have allowed us grace if we've been slightly early before). We also agree with another reviewers comments on the state of the foyer toilets, the corridors and the room wasn't great, albeit quite large. Also the TV didn't work which didn't help our feelings towards the place either.

I returned to reception and requested another room. Following that, I left the hotel to walk to Hanger Lane Tube Station to buy my travel ticket for the next day. Upon my return to the accommodation, two men were fighting on the steps to the entrance. The police became involved; it was an aggressive and violent incident. Following my evening meal, more police officers arrived and publicly arrested another couple and carried evidence bags through the communal area along with the arrested individuals who were cuffed. A building contractor, to whom I was speaking, advised that I should move my car to the front of the hotel as the duty security guards wouldn\u2019t take any preventative action should damage occur to any of the vehicles, they were too scared. I followed his advice. He also mentioned that during the week that he had already stayed, prostitution and overt drug use was commonplace. Whilst I was in the caf\u00e9, I overheard two other guests leaving for another hotel with complaints over the safety and general atmosphere and cleanliness of the Wembley Travelodge. At this point (8.30pm) I retired to my room to do some work. At 9.30pm I undressed for bed and attempted to chain the door. I was unable to. The door frame and lock had been completely split. I did not notice this when I originally checked in. I was moved to 3 other rooms. Each had their problems, the bathroom doors kicked in, the shaver plugs in the bathroom smashed, windows broken. I eventually settled for a twin room in a corridor smelling strongly of cannabis smoke. I didn't sleep, at 4am I heard a commotion outside, I looked out and the police were there again. I feared my car had been smashed up. The next morning I went to reception and there were blood splatters on the floor.......

The bathroom wasn't as clean as I would have liked, the shower was blackened with mould and there was a big crack running down the centre of the sink. When we decided to head to bed, we realised that the window in the room wouldn\u2019t fully shut. This was bought to the attention of the staff at reception who told us that there were no other rooms available because the hotel was fully booked that night. So our only option was to spend the night with the duvet cover over our heads in order shield ourselves from the draft coming in through the window. As you can imagine, the next day we awoke feeling worst for wear and with a head cold. My friends who were staying in rooms 205 and 206 were kept up all night by a neighbouring room which seemed to have 7+ people staying in it. They were playing load music, slamming doors, shouting/talking loudly and smoking cannabis in the room and in the corridor all night. After numerous complaints to the room and four trips downstairs to make complaints to the hotel staff on the front desk, it was 7.30am before they were finally asked to leave the hotel. I thought that there was no way this hotel stay could get any worse, sadly I was wrong! We checked out of the hotel at midday the next afternoon and walking to the car (which was in the hotel car park for which I had paid \u00a35!) we realised that the passenger side window had been smashed and the car had been broken into. We went back into the hotel and were handed the phone to contact the police. When we asked if any other cars had been broken into we were told that a total of three cars (including mine) had been targeted. The hotel staff did not appear to be surprised in the slightest! With a 106 mile journey ahead of us and no call-out services available to put even a temporary fix on the window, we found the hotel staff (including the manager) to be absolutely useless. In the end we left the hotel with a makeshift window made from cling film (which we had to go out and purchase ourselves after being told that the front desk staff/manager had no access to kitchen), plastic bags and cello-tape.

We decided to make a weekend of it as the gig was on the Saturday evening and so we stayed on Friday and Saturday evenings. Having arrived at 9:00 in the evening, we decided to get some food at the restaurant in the hotel. We noticed very quickly that the place was shabby, tired and we commented that it had clearly suffered from cost cutting! The carpets on the corridors were unclean and the wallpaper was clearly patched up in places! Our room was on the road side of the hotel - it was loud but we decided to live with it - I lived in a house on a busy road as a kid so i can live with traffic sound. The in-laws, that we were travelling with, live in a very quiet cul-de-sac and so asked for a room change, which they were given to the opposite side of the corridor - it was quieter. The food was adequate and hot but was a little greasy - not too bad though. When we decided to head to bed, we were already a bit giddy and laughing at the shabby nature of the hotel - although our room was actually pretty good with a very good bathroom. My father in law asked us to nip into their room to look at their view of the stadium. When we did, it became very clear that they only had one curtain and it was dirty - like stained! It was the last straw and we just fell about laughing! They loosened the curtain and tied it up and made do! The next day was very cloudy and wet at the start and so my wife decided to leave her sunglasses (\u00a3100 Ray Bans) on the bedside cabinet (I'll come back to that). We had a great day in London and the gig was outstanding. It took a while to get back to the hotel but we managed to get a taxi from a taxi stand by Wembley Central station. Bed, brekkie next day was as good as Saturday's - pretty decent - had better/had worse! When we got back to our room to get ready to check out, we realised that my wife's sunglasses had gone. We were on a fifth floor room, where the windows only opened by about 5cm. The only way in and out was via a key card and the room had not been messed up in any way. The only thing that could have possibly happened was that they went during the cleaning cycle on the previous day. I hate to say that because I like to trust people but that is the only time that the room would have been open. We spoke to the management who said that they would speak to the staff to find out if they had taken them but, unsurprisingly, the answer came back as no! Sadly, we also heard a woman saying to the management that her phone had gone at the same time in the same way. My wife had used the glasses for about a year and we aren't going to let it ruin a great weekend, but it was disappointing! I know it can be said that we shouldn't have left them on the bedside cabinet but, to be honest, we didn't even think about it! Anyhow, in conclusion this is a tired hotel in need of some refurbishment. The rooms are typical of travelodge and the bathroom was very good. The pub food menu was ok and the breakfast was generally good. The location was pretty good for the stadium but there needs to be some improvement to sound proofing (although it is referred to on the website).

We stayed here for one night to save driving home after a concert at Wembley stadium. I wish id driven home! The hotel itself is in dire need of a makeover, the reception area is tired, very basic and just generally not very pleasant (stained carpets, tacky floors etc). The stairway offers little encouragement en route to your room, dirty carpets giving way to plain metal steps and the sense of using the stairs in a multi storey car park. The rooms themselves are clean and tidy, but its in the rooms that the main problem with this hotel is to be found. NOISE and plenty of it, the traffic outside is relentless (we saw less traffic on the M1 on our journey home) and it feels (and sounds) like your sat right on top of it. The glazing is simply insufficient to shield even the worst of the noise. Ive stayed in noisy hotels before with slamming doors and noisy lift mechanisms etc but this place takes the biscuit. Even with ear plugs in (purchased hastily in London having realised how bad it is after our arrival) the noise was ridiculous. The traffic never stops and the noise is unremitting. Unless you\u2019re the sort of person who can sleep through a herd of trumpeting elephants then steer clear. If your lucky enough to get a room on the other side of the hotel you may find the noise isn\u2019t a problem, im guessing that it may be a bit better there, but cant say for sure as despite asking to be moved, there were no rooms available on that side for us to move to. In terms of location, this hotel is approx 2 miles from Wembley stadium, not too difficult to get back to after a concert at the hallowed ground you may think\u2026\u2026 Well 3 hours after the concert finished we eventually made it back. You could probably walk it in less than that but id advise against it as the area doesn\u2019t seem the safest and a lot of the route is along dual carriageway without pavement. We left Wembley stadium pretty swiftly and were funnelled down the main concourse towards Wembley Park tube station along with 90,000 other people. Mounted police hold the crowd back as the station obviously couldn\u2019t cope with everyone flooding in all at once. It ended up taking a good half hour to get to the station (usually about 10 mins walk). If your going to an event at Wembley you may be interested to know that there were literally no taxis around (not even occupied ones). We tried ringing one and the firm advised that there just weren\u2019t any in the area as it was so busy. We also tried getting to a bus but found the queues just as bad. So the only option left was the tube, usually im happy to travel on the underground, but the real pinch here is that to get the 2 miles back to the Travelodge on the tube, you have to go all the way into central London, change lines twice (first at Baker Street, then at Bond Street) to come all the way back out again. Its then a ten min walk from Hangar Lane station back to the Travelodge and the comfort of your noisy hotel room. Also, I could be wrong, but I strongly suspect that the train out of Wembley Park has no engine and is in fact pulled by a horse. Of course Travelodge aren\u2019t responsible for such transport difficulties or the volume of people trying to get out of Wembley after an event, but its something to consider if your thinking of staying here after a concert of event of some kind. You may want to think twice before booking in here as its very difficult to get back to and its not the best of hotels in the first place. Given the transport chaos after a Wembley event, its easier to get into central London than it is to get back to the Travelodge. You may even want to think about driving (there were queues to get out of the car park, but I doubt anyone queued for 3 hours!). In the interests of fairness I\u2019ll say that the staff at the Travelodge were all friendly and helpful, the rooms were clean and we parked easily (we arrived approx 12.30). Travelodge do also refer to the road noise on their website, but all in all this is a poor hotel in a poor location.

The reception was clean, as was the bar area , considering the hotel was full of Muse fans! (We are both over 45 years old.) The bedroom we had was on the 6th floor, and was very clean and comfortable, with tea/coffee making facilities. The en-suite bathroom was very clean, with lovely soft ,fluffy white towels!! There was a T.V., but we never tried it. I can't comment on the food, because we chose not to eat there, but there seemed to be a lot of people having breakfast in the morning, and a lot of people were ordering pizza deliveries, even after the gig. The bar was still open and very busy when we got back at midnight...and was still going when we went up to our room at 1am. We walked to Wembley stadium. It took us about 30 minutes walking briskley. I had been worried about walking back at night, but needn't have worried as there were loads walking back to the hotel, and we just fell in with them. However, I had researched bus routes on-line and there is plenty of scope for bus journeys if that's your thing. The only thing I feel I ought to comment negatively on is the sound of the traffic outside. Our room was at the front of the hotel and my husband had a poor sleep due to it, but, because I wear a hearing aid, when I took it out, I could barely hear it, and slept very well!!

The hotel is conveniently located on the North Circular Road approximately the same distances between two metro stations. We found that Stonebridge Park was the most accessible one either with the bus # 112 or on foot. From there you can take the overground which is faster to get to Euston station as it is more direct. The hotel is a \"take back\" from Holiday Inn Express. The rooms even still look like the Holiday Inn express. It is a good hotel, the staff is friendly and the breakfast is suitable, although, a bit expensive for what you get. There are no cheese, very limited bread selection and pastry and the scrambled eggs are normally over cooked. Now: here is what you have to know to enjoy your stay. Because of it's location, it is better to have a room at the back of the hotel to enjoy a quieter night of sleep. I say quieter because there are also industries all around. When you can close the window, you almost block all the noise. The problem is that the hotel has no air conditioning and it gets very hot. So... if you travel in cool weather you'll be fine, but don't book there if you are going to travel in the hot days of summer. The window in the room opens only partially which doesn't help much either. The staff can provide you with a fan (in very limited quantities) but it will not really help when the weather is hot. The amenities (instant coffee, tea and creamer of milk) are replenished everyday and whenever we asked something from the reception desk, it was always done. There are a lot of complaints about the carpark (parking in normal English), but there are sufficient signs all around to tell you about it. This is a big problem all throughout England and the hotels do their best to tell you about it. The restaurant of the hotel will serve simple meals. There are very few restaurants in the immediate area, mostly because it is either residential or industrial.

My boyfriend and I stayed here for 3 nights whilst on a long weekend trip to London. Our room was clean, spacious and well equipped. We were provided with extra pillows upon request by the friendly and polite reception staff. I telephoned the hotel before arriving to request a room at the back of the hotel (recommend doing) which we were allocated \u2013 over the weekend we had no noise disturbances whatsoever. The only slight problem we had was on the Monday morning there were a few sounds from the factories below but nothing that disturbing (and I am a very light sleeper). The bathroom was clean and fairly modern and the shower powerful with hot water at all times. The maid came with fresh towels and supplies on the Saturday and we even decided to pay \u00a310 extra to use the late check out facility which allowed us to check out at 2pm. I have slept in comfier beds but for the price we paid I could put up with a slightly thinner than normal mattress. There is a well stocked bar with food and drink at the hotel if you wish to have a bite to eat, we actually ordered a take away pizza one night from flyers we found left around the hotel which was delicious and cheap. The area isn\u2019t the best but to be fair I didn\u2019t see any gangs of hoodies roaming the streets or anything untoward. I would avoid the subways after dark but that\u2019s just common sense. I must say however that we did not take a car with us and only used the tube so I can\u2019t comment on how safe the parking is. We didn\u2019t witness any break-ins during our 3 night stay but perhaps best to travel by train to be safe if possible. We walked to and from Hanger Lane tube which is about 8-10 mins walk straight down the road and took 10 mins to get to White City/Shepherds Bush or 20 mins to get to Oxford Circus etc. There is also a large leisure complex 15 mins walk away at Park Royal with a cinema, Pizza Hut, Chinese buffet, bowling etc. Not the Ritz but by no means the worse hotel I\u2019ve stayed in \u2013 fine for what you pay for.", "Date": "August 10, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Norwich, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cNot nice...can'r really think of anything positive\u201d", "Author": "lovelyharry12", "ReviewID": "UR74435292", "Content": "not good. everything just a bit grubby and in need of renovation.

The third was not any better. Our room was very basic which is expected from a travelodge. Only a piece of soap and 2 plastic cups in our room. There was a chunk taken from our hotel room door. There was mildew around the shower cubicle and there were loads of unsightly stains (I dread to think what they were!!!!!) all over the carpet and our one chair which we did not sit on. There was only 1 pillow on the bed so decided to go down to reception and collect another couple. Unfortunately only handed 1 - told they had run out of them, no sorry, nothing, and actually the staff were not friendly and made no effort in relation to customer service. Had to sleep with a couple of towels under my pillow, which was not very comfortable. Did not sleep due to uncomfortable bed - I think the mattress had been in a marathon as there were springs sticking into my ribs. Lovely view of the industrial buildings around us. In the evening decided to go for a drink in the lounge, staff ok, but food like rubber - by this time I did not expect anything else. Breakfast next morning was much better. If it was not for a course which was booked the next day, we would have got back onto the next train. Location handy for tube connections but unfortunately tube station hanger lane in a middle of a roundabout on a dual carriageway, which on Sunday is a bit of a nightmare to get off.

The hotel is also set in an industrial estate on the north circular and beware, that from the 5th floor you can see into some of the factory windows, so I guess they can see you too! Pillows are wafer thin indeed, so take you own! The state of repair is really bad, already mentioned by many on here! The place needs a proper refurb. It is the worst travelodge I have seen. There are some good ones and and this is a real let down. A lot of the rooms have problems and we actually stayed in three different rooms during our visit because each one had problems like no hot water, no curtains (sellotaped remnants only!) etc. Each time we complained we were actually offered one of our previous rooms again, and I knew nothing had been fixed as it was the weekend when no repairs took place. There is also only one working lift for the 7 storey building as the other one has been awaiting repair for some time. It can be a long wait at busy times. The car park is not safe. Cars get broken into there. It is about 10 mins walk to the nearest tube. Stonebridge park should be avoided at night. Hangar lane is slightly further but safer as it is a bit busier. The walk is alongside the north circular past several factories and it is not pleasant. Oh and the smell of cannabis smoke on most floors and even the non smoking rooms! When there is a problem, the worst thing is you have call an 0845 number from your mobile to speak to reception (no internal phone around), and the only solution is to change rooms which we did twice, which is a pain as you can't ever properly unpack. The first time we moved, they shifted our things for us but managed to lose one of my shoes in the process, so we did it ourselves the second time. I went to reception a couple of times about this as I had no other formal shoes and you get responses like 'we'll check'....'yes we found it, didn't we return it?'....'the cleaner should have put it in your room'....etc and eventually someone handed it to me from behind the counter on my penultimate day! Complaining falls on deaf ears. I have yet to hear from Travelodge HQ....when you google them, they don't appear to have much customer service anyway! All in all, you will be ok if you get a room at the back and everything works in the room. If also you pay a rock bottom price, I guess this is where good reviews will come from.

Its a biker cafe with a long long history but the locals are very friendly!) The Big Breakfast at the Ace is just that, and great value at around \u00a36 with a cuppa as well! We didn't experience any problems with the car park, although signs on it did warn it was a car crime hotspot. Park in the view of a security camera! The hotel couldn't get us any extra pillows and we did have to ask 3 times for a fan in our impossibly hot room, but we did get one in the end. Had I read some of the reviews on here before I went I think I would have been dreading my trip. Some paint a very inaccurate picture of the hotel and its location.

The only downside is the area, certainly not the kind of place you want to be walking on your own after nightfall. I would avoid walking to Stonebridge Park station at any time of the day, due to the large amount of \"gangs\" which appear to hang around under the railway bridges. If you must travel around after nightfall, I recommend getting the 112 bus to either Stonebridge Park station or walk under the subway to the opposite side of the road and get the 112 bus to Hanger Lane Station (Best option in my opinion, Central Line train direct to Tottenham Court Road!).

The rooms are, as others say, unusually large for a Travelodge - but that's where the praise ends. The window didn't shut properly, the extractor fan didn't work, the flush on the toilet was like spitting at a rottweiler. The Cafe-Bar was neither a cafe nor a bar. It had just three main courses on offer of the eight on the standard menu, with the five - shall we say - 'land based meat' options oddly all unavailable. The Bar had the first four choices of drink out of stock to the point they couldn't even charge me \u00a32.90 for the advertised 440ml can (yes, can) of Strongbow that would have cost 60p from a supermarket. Most people would book this hotel to go to Wembley Stadium/Arena as I did. I'll echo the advice of others to be wary of the night. Leaving the Travelodge on foot there is about a third of a mile of abandoned buildings that have waste, graffiti, and broken windows. At night, roving groups of hoodies wander round with their faces hidden. You'll be OK in a group, as I was, otherwise spend the tenner on a taxi just for your own sanity. Having said that, with the lack of options available at the hotel, we ventured onwards very early to find food and drink. The Ace Cafe, about 1/3mile further along the road towards the stadium, is fantastic. Realistically priced good - simple - food. We also picked out a small family run Irish bar further on the route to the stadium. I forget the name, but we spent six hours in there happily and at very reasonable prices. I expect one thing of a Travelodge, being a budget hotel, and that is of a decent night's sleep. I've been in Travelodges all over the country and had fine nights on the side of usually deafening motorways. This one failed badly, on both nights. Even on the discounted price I had the room for it was poor value. Better soundproofing, and better management, would do this place no harm.

I feel I MUST tell you what a good deal it was and how pleasantly surprised we were - i imagined something much worse. I did take note of booking rooms at the back and am glad we did, due to the noise at the front. We had to book 2 rooms as the family room wasn't available but we did manage to get a 'super saver' on both the rooms so 3 nights in london cost us under \u00a360 for all of us - couldn't complain. we wanted the rooms next to each other and the staff couldn't have been more helpful to accommodate us. We ended up at the back, on the 7th floor which is the place to be! Rooms were exceptionally clean, extremely quiet and well furnished and the showers powerful. We were there when the outside temperature was 28 degrees & the staff provided fans as the rooms ARE warm, but at the back, no noise probs if you want to leave the window open at night. The walk to the station (Stonebridge) is 15 mins (even with an 8 year old!), alongside the North Circular: not attractive but certainly not threatening in day light.

Breakfast is \u00a37.50 per adult and is perfectly adequate and kids eat free - BRILLIANT idea!! We saw many families at the hotel and we all agreed that having the restaurant on site was a bonus.

Plus points: Cheap. \u00a355 a room tops, book early enough and you can get a room here for \u00a329 or less. \u00a32.70 a pint of Carlsberg and cheaper than Central London bar prices.

Minus points: Noisy, at the front anyway. It sits just off the North Circular which has constant traffic passing 24/7. The rooms above the ground floor get very warm and there's no air con, so you have to open a window - which means getting a room at the BACK of the hotel.

It's not a main road and hotel guests are constantly walking past so it's safe enough. If you want to stay here for an event in Wembley Stadium, book early and get to breakfast early.

The room was basic, TV, with basic channels, double bed, desk, kettle and tea/coffee making bits and bobs. The bathroom was fine until i got into the shower. I started having a shower and the water was not going away! it got rather worrying, you didn't exactly want the water to go all over the floor. The water was hot and nice but you had to hurry up so it wouldn't overflow! It gradually went down thankfully. Could not be bothered trying to complain, felt we would just grit our teeth and bare it.

If we do decide to go to anymore matches/concerts at Wembley, we will pay the extra cash and stay somewhere nearer.", "Date": "September 24, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "1", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Peterborough, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cBed Bugs\u201d", "Author": "SilviaY", "ReviewID": "UR8823956", "Content": "We stayed two nights at the hotel this past weekend and found the hotel staff very friendly and approachable however the room and the overall standard of the hotel were appalling. Our room was located in the 4th floor and there was a pungent smell of fried garlic and onions, which we put down to guests eating take away in their rooms but it was so strong that it seemed someone had been cooking in one of the rooms. Our room was dusty and there was a patched hole in the wall. That night we slept badly but we put it down to tiredness and waking up early. On the second night we decided to go to bed around 22:30 to get some sleep but just after midnight we were woken up by children running up and down the corridor. After about 1/2 hour my partner decided to complain but the adult playing chase with the children reply was: \"it is her birthday\". They did quiet down after 1 hour. By then we have noticed the reason we did not sleep well the night before were bed bugs!!. The receptionist was very sympathetic and offered a complimentary breakfast but by then I just wanted to leave the hotel to never come back again!!!!", "Date": "September 19, 2007"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Travelodge Wembley", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g186338-d597383-Reviews-Travelodge_Wembley-London_England.html", "Price": "0", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">North Circular Road</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\">Ealing</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">London</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">NW10 7UG</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">England</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "2514314", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/01/c0/1d/d8/travelodge-wembley-thumbnail.jpg"}}
