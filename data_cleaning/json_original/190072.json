Got to the Hotel, the receptionist's fax machine ''had been on the blick all day'' so our reservation, we made two days previous, had not come through. As to why they have not had it fixed or got reservation details via email etc. we will never know. At first the receptionist was quite blunt and didn't seem to care how many hours we had traveled to find the hotel in the first place. Once we had stood there for the best part of an hour sorting this out, with many phone calls back and forth to Late Rooms (through no fault of theirs- fantastic website), we get our key. Then it just gets worse.. Lift was broken and wasn't fixed for our entire stay there, so we had to trek six flights of longs stair cases whenever we wanted to go in or out (but still with the smallest hope still in our minds we had the key to a fabulous room like we had seen in the advertisement pictures- and why we booked with this hotel). Anything but fabulous.. We unlocked the door, and what to others might not be an issue but is not what we were sold was a shockingly decorated room. Awful curtains and not modern at all. Stayed in better family run B&B's. The we slowly found the following problems.. - Cracks swarmed the 'living area's' ceiling. - 'Living area' was freezing cold- heater wasn't working. - The TV signal was rubbish, kept flickering and sound going off. - Lamp didn't work. - The bathroom door lock didn't work. - Wallpaper was coming off the walls. - Grime round the edge of the bath. - There was no main lights to the room, only lamps which wasn't enough light. - No milk for the tea. - Electrical plugs were tough to plug in our appliances. - Beds were uncomfortable, my dad didn't sleep much at all. - Breakfast is an extra \u00c2\u00a314.99 per person (for a piece of bread and orange juice). Of course we didn't opt for their breakfast; found a lovely cafe 'EAT' around the corner, \u00c2\u00a32.99 for more, nicer food. So, final summation: DON'T book with this hotel. If the problems i've listed above sound acceptable for a room that is up for reservations at \u00c2\u00a3890 at a '4*' modern hotel then you need a serious re-think of values. Put a huge dampener on our trip and I really hope no-one has to go through the same disappointment.

We had a bit of a snafu with the booking through easytobook.com and ended up having the reservation cancelled...which we didn't find out about until we got there at 7p after travelling all day from Paris. The staff were very helpful in a stressful situation. We got *A* room but not *THE* room we were supposed. It was a \"Single-Double\" vs the \"Double-Double\" we paid for but they moved us to the MUCH bigger D-D room the next day. Which was great...untill the A/C didn't work. The staff addressed immediately by moving us again (pain in the butt having to repack up) -- INTO A SUITE!!! -- which we kept the duration of our week-long trip. The location of the hotel is excellent -- about 5m from the Knightsbridge tube stop and right across the street from the South edge of Hyde Park. This is a VERY POSH area of London; right across from the Rolex store and McLarran dealership; the Ferrari dealer is around the corner; a ton of boutiques, Gap, H&M, and Harrod's are all no more than 5m walk. Starbucks is around the corner; too many eateries to count, and security...I've never seen so many cops patrolling (and London has a ton of them). This was literally the day after the N. London riots so I'm guessing they were precautionary, but still, it is VERY SAFE. In addition, there are TWO pubs (they are chain pubs but nonetheless 2 of them!) right next door, annd another around the corner offering pretty good English food (I'm American and don't know whether it's \"proper British food\" but was what I expected) and decent rates. We also had dinner at the Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park Hotel and it was excellent without being overly pricey (on par with- though cheaper than a night at Morton's). Be advised: The hotel is currently being renovated. There was no obvious work going on while we visited but you can definitely tell that there are some areas that are in need of TLC. The rooms themselves were fairly modern. The furnishings are IKEA (i.e., they good but are not of the best quality) and have a very modern feel. As I mentioned the A/C units are in the process of being replaced -- the 1st and 3rd rooms had no problems. The bathrooms are spacious, offer full bathtubs with showers overhead and plenty of counter-space. The beds were fairly comfortable, above-average. The biggest down-side to this hotel is the internet. They have the router in the basement and the only place you can get wifi is in the lobby/lounge. VERY inconvenient for anyone NEEDING the internet extensively during their visit. There is limited space in this area as well. The other thing is that the internet has a tendency to drop off. A call to The Geek Squad would probably fix this issue but for whatever reason, it had not been done as of my check out. I am fairly meticulous about reading/ analyzing the reviews before booking and I did see some unfavorable reviews (or maybe \"less desirable\" is better). I would honestly say most of them seemed to be pretty over-blown based on my experience. For the rate we paid (about $150 US -- in AUG 2011), we totally got our money's worth -- even had we not gotten the suite. I have stayed in London before (in 2003 at a Holiday Inn near the British Museum) and this hotel was on par with the other place though the other place had a restaurant area (never did see -- or ask about eating at this place).

Staff lied to me about two issues - Wi-Fi in the hotel and availability of other rooms (a part time member of staff told me there were plenty rooms free while I was there). 2. This is a guest house, not a hotel - no bar, no dining room etc. 2. Wi-Fi was advertised in each room, there was none. One member of staff told me it not working in my room and it would be repaired later that day. The following day I mentioned it to reception again that it still wasn't working - listen to this - a different member of staff said - \"ok I'll be honest with you, it will be fixed on Thursday\". I was due to check out on Wednesday - how convenient! Three nights without any Wi-Fi. I was told that I could use it in the lobby, but guess what? The router was so old and therfore the signal was so bad I gave up browsing the internet in the \"hotel\". I used an internet cafe each day instead. 3. They had some large towels crumpled up on the carpet in my bedroom that were catching serious drips coming from the air conditioning unit when it was in operation. 4. The walls in the bathroom were filthy, I mean with grime and lots of old stains like shampoo splatters and toothpaste (painted walls) 5. The white light fitting in the bathroom buzzed constantly obviously due to faulty wiring and the light fitting was blackened around the bulbs from previous shorts or maybe the bulbs blowing. 6. Television - the most frustrating television set up I have ever come across, a member of staff came up to fix it and while he was there I asked him why is this place so poor. He said it was bought by someone who just let it go to rack and ruin, and that they were quite used to people complaining. He fixed the television for me (for your information I am in my 30's and I am quite competent when it comes to programming tvs etc but this tested my skills!!). 7. The coving in the ceiling was in very bad shape, the carpet was not vacuumed properly, lots of dust around the headboard of the bed. 8. \"Breakfast\" - delivered to your room - cold toast, yogurt was like out of date cream, milk was ok as it was in a packet, cereal was fine as it was out of a packet.

The hotel itself looked ok, but there were signs of wear on the carpets and as mentioned the lift was a bit outdated. Still on getting to our room we were pleasantly surprised. It was clean spacious and modern. Again some signs of wear and a few small easily fixable things, such as the light switch button was missing and there were cables untidly running to the tvs (yes we have 2 televisions, one in the bedroom and one in the lounge area) also the room looked like it had been decorated in a hurry, but overall it was nice. The bed was huge and very comfortable, it was 2 large singles pushed together but it didnt feel like it. The bathroom was clean, which was all my wife was concerned about and the shower although it looked like it might not work was actually very good. We were staying here out of necessity rather than desire, but i would say it was ok. There was no information about breakfast and when we called down to reception to ask about it at 9.15am we were told it finished at 9.30 so we didnt get time to find out what that was like, however i saw a tray being delivered to the room next door of what looked like a continental breakfast that would have been very acceptable. All being said i would not recommend this hotel if you are looking for a friendly, well maintained hotel with good facilitiles, but if like us you just needed a reasonably priced night in a hotel that is in an excellent location then it would be ideal.", "Date": "May 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New yo", "Title": "\u201cLies and false advertising\u201d", "Author": "dyaffe", "ReviewID": "UR109376916", "Content": "Don't go here. * They claim internet but its only available in a tiny lobby. * The rooms are tiny. * The staff is rude.", "Date": "May 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bristol, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cAwful hotel, terrible service, poor quality rooms.

After booking and finding out where it was, I immediately tried to negotiate a change with Last Minute - to no avail. Their customer service is rubbish. All I'll say is NEVER book a Top Secret with them. Personally, I'll never book anything with them. Anyway, back to the hotel. It seems as if a one-armed, cross -eyed DIY fanatic has been let loose. But there are advantages to this hotel if you can book it cheaply. (1) The rooms are spacious (well the ones I saw, at least) (2) The location is good in the heart of Knightsbridge (3) Room 41 as a single traveller was actually not bad - hilariously bad fit-out, but spacious. Interesting hole in the bathroom ceiling, but big bathroom. Looks over a quiet-ish lane and a building site. But I was up early so this didn't bother me. (4) Don't go for the upgrade suite (the photos they use on the site) - hideous, noisy and dirty as the windows face the internal courtyard with kitchen fans going. Windows also have a fire escape balcony outside which just shouts 'rob me' . I took one look and asked to be moved to the smaller room (41) But don't go with expectations.

She was only a few metres away on a call with a customer that was due to arrive that day. She was explaining and apologizing that due to a group of 5 overstaying at the hotel, that they had no rooms available. Apparently the guests couldn't be located and as their luggage was open, it couldn't be moved. She told the guest on the telephone, not to worry, and to come as planned as they have alternative rooms at a sister hotel close by. I knew this didn't bide well for my stay, and sure enough, after she got off the phone, I was delivered the same story and apology. Reluctantly I agreed to the other hotel, so she called for a taxi and were on our way. The alternative hotel was the Tophams in Ebury Street which was about a 15 minute journey by cab.

The room we booked at the Knightsbridge Green had wireless Internet and air-conditioning, neither of which was available at this hotel. At the very very best, this would struggle for a 2 star rating. We made our way back up the road to Tophams so we could at least check our emails etc, and whilst there we checked the reviews on TripAdvisor...... omg ... Why hadn't I checked before making the booking, this hotel regularly overbooks and then shuffles customers to other inferior properies hoping that they just cop it. This along with the very bad feedback on other aspects convinced me that we needed an escape plan. I quickly surfed a few options and found a lovely hotel called the Westbury, which is located In Mayfair. It's a little more expensive, but the room is lovely, the location is great and the staff are friendly. Absolutley positively avoid the Knightsbridge Green.

The manager was not much help other than he could find us 3 rooms at the hotel and 5 rooms at the Hilton in Wembley (not very close to Knightbridge at all) We were offered 4 rooms at the hotel and suggested we could share, we took the 4 rooms and managed ourselves to book 4 rooms elsewhere. The 4th room no.64 was awful, a single bed, dents in the walls, cracked ceiling, a shower cubicle that do not work at all, walk past kitchen to get to room, looked like the room that the staff stay over in. In general the hotel is not four stars and don't know who in their right mind would give it that rating. Staff attitude was could not care less and to get them to provide cups for tea etc was a trial and 4 hours later cups still left on tables. No bar at hotel but they advertise in their plush folders that beer, wine and spirits is available", "Date": "June 23, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "england", "Title": "\u201cneeds updating, no hot water, staff not very helpful\u201d", "Author": "England12345", "ReviewID": "UR66604388", "Content": "Me and my partner stayed here for one night in May as we were seeing a show, booked the hotel as the rooms looked nice in the pictures however dont be fooled they need updating.

Reception greeting was flat and unwelcoming, and not a very luxurious looking place either. 4 floors up to our room in what looked like a staff lift that nearly eats your hands and luggage if your'e not careful with the spring loaded door!! Our room was a suite which was quite honestly appalling, tired, old looking, faded, chipped paint on walls, damp wallpaper in bathroom,stains on carpet,filthy dining table,cracked ceiling. 4 star plus rating?? By who?? Our complaint to move was unheard so we had no choice to try and enjoy our 1 night stay, neither hotels were willing to sort out anything as they were both \"fully booked\" and no manager available to complain to in either. I was told when I complained in the KG hotel to reception \"do you realise how much people pay to stay here\" Truly disgusting service. Oh, and its incredibly noisy next to the road and there are attractive building sites on either side of the hotel to top it off. Breakfast was a joke, burnt toast and tinned fruit, the quantities ordered were lacking, one glass of juice, 1 plate, 1 knife and napkin between 2! Would never recommend this to anyone, it ruined our stay. In devon where we live this would never happen.

The front desk called us by name as we were the last guests arriving for the day (mid-day arrival...people must check in early there). The front desk staff was efficient, but not too friendly.

We asked to move, and we got a different room that was completely different -- and much more comfortable (plus it had a king bed). The room fixtures and furniture are okay. The bed was very low to the ground. The air conditioning unit worked very well and was quiet. In the evening, the owner's son worked the front desk. He was quite pleasant.

We were traveling with our 2 children, then 10 and 8, and needed a relatively spacious room without paying $1000 a night. We also wanted a central location and a clean hotel. The KG met and exceeded our requirements on every count. The hotel itself is located in Knightsbridge, 1/2 a block from Hyde Park (perfect for early evening pick-up \"football\" matches for my husband and son, and for relaxing walks along the lake and runs in the morning). It was also 1/2 block from Harrod's, right on the bus route to Kensington/Portobello Road, and in the othe direction to Trafalger Square/Picadilly/Covent Garden, a block from one of the main Tube lines (the one to Heathrow), and a pretty easy walk to Buckingham Palace and on to Westminster. We always felt very safe. The location simply couldn't have been better. The hotel itself is quite small, so the manager knows all his guests by name and interest. He couldn't have been more helpful in deciding what to do and where to go. The other staff were similarly helpful. Our room ended up being a small suite, with the living room turning into a bedroom each night (with a sofa bed and an added cot - great to avoid sibling squabbles). The bath was spacious, full of marble and very clean. By London standards, it was very reasonably priced - especially for the amount of room we had! Although this isn't a luxury hotel with tons of activities and other services, it was perfect for what we needed during our stay in London - a clean and comfortable place to spend the night in a terrific location and for a very reasonable (by London's outrageous standards) price.

I have read other reviews that said it was noisy, but we found the double windows (not double paned, but actually two windows, one inside the other) shut out a good portion of the noise if you can keep them closed. I think the lack of noise was also due to the fact that we were on the top floor. The room itself was quite large, which was especially nice with a teenager, but as noted by others, could stand updating. But one of the things we liked was that the bathroom was quite large and the sink was large enough to hold both our toiletries bags, so we weren't fighting for space. The staff was always very helpful and nice. The only thing I objected to was the price of the breakfast, which was \u00c2\u00a37.50 per person.
