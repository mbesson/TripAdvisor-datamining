I also hope that when Best Western management see this review, it will help to identify areas in which they can improve. Poorly maintained historic 'round' (hence the name Roundhouse) hotel located in a high traffic and industrial area in Roxbury. Very loud and noisy and currently, the trash dumpster get emptied around 2:30am. At least that was the schedule for the days/nights I was there. Large trucks with their back-up beepers blaring 24/7. Close to hospital, so blaring sirens 24/7 also. Very limited parking. Area is prone to lots of foot traffic...park at your own risk! Did NOT feel safe walking from my car to the entrance at night. Busy gas station next door with bright lights. Curtains did not block out the light during the night. Drafty, ill-fit windows allowed cold wind to blow directly in as well as all traffic noise. I used the couch cushions to try and stop the cold air, but it did not work. Unclean and stale smoke smell through out the entire hotel. When you first walk in (manual doors with NO handicap opener) you can smell freshly baked cookies...I thought UMMMM, UMMMM! But as you ride up in the elevator and step onto the floors...your greeted with dim lighting, dark decor, and smoke. The smell in the rooms only gets worse... Internet is slow and I was unable to sustain connectivity for work purposes and I ended up using my personal air card. Stained and peeling wallpaper throughout the hotel, broken tiles in the bathrooms, towel bar falling off the wall, broken lid on back of commode, broken curtain rods, torn curtains, rust stains in the tubs, broken toilet, and I had a leaning toilet! Carpet is filthy. I kicked my shoes off when I came in....ended up throwing my socks away because they were black! Sheets are well worn, but at that comfy stage instead of stiff and starchy. Toiletries not restocked. Had to go to front desk to get shampoo! The little two-room suite are large enough. Has a nice size desk, newer desk chair, small microwave and fridge.

I was lucky enough to get the 6th floor, reserved for rewards members and was very happy with the layout and features of the small suite until I make it to the bed. What a shame! The linens were as old as the hills and were pilled, course and simply uncomfortable. The pillows were equally poor and lumpy. But somehow I managed to get about 6 hours of sleep and make my way to the extremely average and unremarkable continental breakfast. The airport shuttle wasn't running and the hotel requires a reservation the day ahead of your need so be warned. They do have a local shuttle to drop you at a T station or bus station however. The staff was extremely friendly. Parking is free but the area is dark and open season on some of the less than desirable people milling about the area so be careful what you park there. Kudos on a nice 6th floor for rewards member and an imaginative floor plan for this very round house hotel. Major demerits for the sheets and pillows. Arguable the worse that I have ever slept on.

We stayed at this hotel over the weekend of dec2-4 and were upgraded to the 6th (Rewards Members) floor which is one of a kind and I haven't seen in any other BW properties I've stayed so far. The room is really huge - the living space and the bed room is separated by a french door. The living room has a flat screen tv and the bed room also has a flat screen tv.The living room has a table/chair, sofa and a small kitchenette (Sink/Microwave/Refrigerator). Though the room looks old but it has kept really clean.This room also comes with 3 phones - one in each room and in the bathroom. Near the lobby, they had a business center with two computers but we haven't used them. They also had three vending machines and one among them is hot food (fries/pizza) which was cool but we haven't used it. Bed/Pillows: The linens were very old and I wish they update bed linens and the pillows also need a replacement. Breakfast: They have a complimentary breakfast - coffee/Juice/Cereals/Bagels/Muffins/Fresh Fruits and waffle maker where you can make your own hot waffles. We were at the breakfast area around 9AM and it was crowded but we could find a table. I also read a sign that they have extra seating area in the lower area and which is not bad at all. Tip: If you are in the rewards floor, you can request your breakfast(limited - not the warm stuff) delivered to your room and you can also specify the time frame. We did try for one day and they delivered it to the room at the time we have requested, spot ON! Shuttle Service: The hotel also provides complimentary shuttle service to near by train stations and restaurants which is a great service. We did use the service and they were punctual when we asked for a pickup from a near by restaurant. Parking: They have a open parking across the street, make sure you get a pass and have it on your dashboard displayed so that you can avoid your vehicle from getting towed. Staff: The front desk people are friendly and they tried to help you if you have any questions. Location: This hotel is located in the southern side of Boston city. Like others mentioned, this is not in a fantastic neighborhood but in a location where you can easily get around. Right across the street, they had McDonald's, pizza place and a gas station. Check-in/Checkout: It was easy, no hassle. They asked me if I'm interested to get a gift basket as being a rewards member or 250 points, i chose to get the basket. It has come with - a pack of chips, a cookie and bottle of water.", "Date": "December 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hartford, Connecticut", "Title": "\u201cNOT in BOSTON\u201d", "Author": "momof2boys_KK", "ReviewID": "UR120619298", "Content": "First thing to know, this hotel is NOT in Boston. It is in Roxbury, which borders Boston but is very different. That would be okay, but the shuttle service itself was not very convenient. It was useful and we did use it, but because they are serving so many customers with so many stops, it was not convenient. When we first arrived we took the shuttle to 'convention center' which to me meant the Hines convention center T-stop just a straight shot from the hotel down Mass Ave. But another couple wanted to go to the boston convention center on the water, which is where we went first. Then the driver didn't want to take us to Hines because it was so far away. He DID bring us to Copley (which is where we ultimately wanted to go), but I don't know why it was such a negotiation. The rooms were small but clean. If you are paranoid about cleanliness in a hotel, you will be pleased. Plastic cups were wrapped in plastic. Beds were triple sheeted. Last, we were surprised when we opened up the sofa bed for our 2 boys and saw no sheets or linens. It turns out they provide a 'bed in bag' in the room with everything to set up the sofa bed. That way you know the linens are fresh. I always worry that housekeepers don't always change the linens on sofa beds. You just have to do it yourself. I wish I had realized that though because I called down to the front desk to request linens and waited over a half hour for somebody to show up when it turns out the linens were in our room the whole time. The downside of the sofa bed was that it was a TWIN bed, and I had 2 boys sleeping on it. My boys are young so it was fine, but if you have older children, you will only be able to fit one person on the sofa bed. The hotel does not have roll away beds. Breakfast was good. Standard waffles. No eggs other than hard boiled and no other warm items. However, when we arrived at breakfast all of the tables were taken, so we stood and waited. The staff sent us downstairs to another room, but when we got there it was locked. So, we went back upstairs and waited. One of the biggest complaints is the lack of tv programming. There was only 1 kids station available, and when we went to it, all we saw was the direct tv icon swirling around the screen. But, you can BUY kids shows for $4 each for a 30 minute show! I was desperate so I did, but the idea of having to pay anything for a PBS kids show is absolutely ridiculous. I complained to the front desk, and they said there was nothing they could do because it was contracted by an outside company. I didn't dispute the charge - I did agree to pay for it, but that's just madness. If you are looking for an inexpensive, clean place to stay, this is it.

The first experience of attempting to change the room type by email sent to the hospitality manager wasn't good since no one answered. Called and that was remedied. Next experience wasn't too good either as the airport shuttle didn't show up. Apparently you need to get a confirmation email from the driver. He claimed never to have received it. BUT from there on the experience got very positive VERY quickly! We were told to take a taxi from the airport which Tiara deducted from the room charge.

The area/ safety. This hotel is in a city. For anyone who lives in/ near a city and who has visited many cities will know that there will be homeless people wandering around. They do not pose a safety issue; they will not bother you, and treat them like anyone else. For those who said that they were scared to walk to their car I was amazed that they stayed at the same hotel. I was out walking around at 10/11 at night. It reminded me of a typical city at night, everyone minding their own business, no safety risk. Some made it sound like it was in the middle of the ghetto. The shuttle was the other point. It is great. What other hotel will take you for free to some place in a city? Stop complaining, you had to wait twenty minutes, boo hoo, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s free, take what you get and be lucky. If it is bothersome drive yourself or stay at the four seasons.

In comparison to other hotels closer to the city center (charging $35-$45 a day), the Roadhouse gives the option of free parking with a free courtesy shuttle (that will take you to certain drop stops within a 2 mile radius or so). That was enough for us to book the hotel. While it is not in the greatest section of town (right next to the medical center) and the parking lot is an old lot across the street), the friendly staff made up for the location. Everyone from the front desk to the shuttle drivers were very helpful, accessible and friendly. The rooms were of typical Best Western suites (a little dated, but good size, comes with a refrigerator, microwave, free wi-fi etc. and it looked like they had bed bug covers on the mattress which is always a good sign that they are doing the best to keep guests comfortable--coming from NYC, bed bugs are troublesome). One of the helpful features is the shuttle service, which takes you to a couple subway stops as well as the Prudential Center (which also has a T-stop). The shuttle does get busy so there is generally a 20 minute wait, however, once it gets you to where you are going, all of Boston is accessible (either via walking or the subway).

I tend to favor BW hotels for their value (price + type of accomodation). You cannot go wrong chosing to stay here based on rate and really decent free breakfast. My one caveat would be not to rely on being able to fully utilize the shuttle. During our stay, the hotel had only one shuttle. If you're not in a hurry to go somewhere and can wait for them, it's a good service, but you must plan it out. Additionally, the staff is not able to reliably tell you when you will go or be picked up. Having been told it was not wise to walk from the nearest subway exit to the hotel (1/2 mile?) at night, we stood at its exit almost an hour waiting for pickup, being told initially that it would be 10 minutes and after we called back after 25 minutes had passed only to be told it would be another 10 minutes. That seemed to be their pat reply. So, my suggestion would be that you could start your day off being dropped at the subway by the shuttle, but then take a taxi back. In fairness, I wish to say that all the staff were pleasant and tried to be helpful, but it seemed like the communication regarding pickup or arrival time between the shuttle driver and the staff was unrealistic. We were also there during a busy college graduation weekend, so, perhaps during more regular times the shuttle service is more reliable. FYI - they have a contract for airport shuttle service, but you cannot take their shuttle to the train station if you're arriving/leaving via train. You must take a taxi. The area is also a bit noisy as there is a major Boston hospital just a few blocks away. If you're a light sleeper, just bring some ear plugs. I'm not a light sleeper and I didn't use ear plugs and don't recall being woken up from any noise, either inside or outside the hotel.

We had a hire car and we chose the Roundhouse because it had Free Parking, and the hotel itself had earned good (deserved) praise and we have BW loyalty membership. The parking for the Roundhouse was across the road from the hotel, but area was well lighted at night and as valuables should never be visible or left in vehicles anywhere anyway, we had no problem. The free breakfast available was good. Wide and plentiful choice and availability of food. Cleanliness of this hotel is impeccable. Our party of parents and adult child and partner, in two suites on the top (sixth) floor, all agreed the Roundhouse is a great hotel, if not the area. The suite fitouts were quite lovely. Bedroom and bathroom areas are roomy and separate small sitting area with couch, coffee table, desk and the wet bar of mini-frig, sink, small bench with coffee maker and microwave. Very useful. A TV in the bedroom and one in the sitting room also appreciated. Lighting, both natural and from fixtures was very good. The area, Roxbury, I would describe as on the outer ring of the Boston central business/tourist district. Another large hotel is across the road, and the Boston Hospital is probably 2 blocks away so the Roundhouse is by no means out in the suburbs but it is not within walking distance of the old historical parks and buildings of Boston. It is not near a T or any other public transport. We were aware of the Roundhouse's location from an older TA critique, for which I was grateful. Previous mention had been made of the area being dodgy (dangerous). It probably is. Most certainly at night. . The hotel's shuttle bus and free parking are its strongpoint, pertinent to the area and Boston's traffic. The younger ones used the shuttle constantly in and out of the city, day and night and really appreciated the service. My husband and I had not presumed we would use the hotel's shuttle bus a lot, but we too did use it a lot and it was a wonderful service, always available and so easy. Mostly we had Wilfredo driving us and he and other drivers are exceptional at what they do and so pleasant and helpful. We caught a few taxis too in Boston central which were very cheap back to the hotel. Approx. $10. For 2 or somethimes the four of us that was cheap.. We loathed Boston traffic, maniacal drivers and the daunting layout of the city and airport freeways etc., Scary stuff. I think my husband could compete in Indy after driving through, around and near Boston. A surprising number of Bostonians agreed with us on the unpleasant driving conditions. Our quite new Sat Nav obviously shared our horror as it died after day one in Boston. The hotel staff advised us where we could buy a new Sat Nav. There is a small shopping centre down Massachusetts Ave., a 10 minute easy walk from the hotel. There was a Target, Shoe outlet, Grocery store and a Best Buys, where we bought a new Sat Nav. Along the way there were a couple of restaurants/diners and immediately across the road from the Roundhouse is a Pizza and Italian takeaway shop and a MacDonalds next door to it as well as a Fuel Station next door to the Roundhouse. However exercise caution being out on the streets there late at night. Our young ones went over to MacDonalds late one night and the 6 foot tall male said he had never been so terrified in his life. He said the locals whilst obviously suffering various forms of substance abuse were enormous men - over 6 Ft 4 giants and of frightening appearance. But the children did stress they were very polite. Whilst they were begging for money. Even on the sixth floor we were aware of the noise of police sirens and lights and odd goings on during the nights. It didn't bother any of us unduly then. A fortnight after our first stay we had an unexpected return to the Roundhouse due to all flights out of Boston being cancelled by the unfortunate tragedy of the tornado. So very late at night we ended up back at the Roundhouse Hotel grateful to get a room, on the third floor. Our initial joy albeit after the day from Hell at the airport, was quenched by the street noise that night. I suspect the lower floors guest rooms facing Mass Ave., do have street noise level issues. However after seeing during Duck and Trolley tours, the locations of many of the hotels I had trawled before deciding on the BW Roundhouse Suites, and that only the most horrendously expensive were right in the central business district, I am glad we stayed at the Roundhouse Suites. Also I could not ever contemplate paying $US 48 a day for car parking, on top of the room rate! A huge recommendation for a restaurant. Petit Robert's Bistro on Columbus St. We had one big dinner there for the 4 of us. Everyone impressed. All meals eaten by our party were wonderful, but strongly recommend the half roast chicken meal.My husband and I subsequently returned there for a very late impromptu dinner after our flights home had been cancelled. Was only good thing about not flying home as scheduled. The very busy staff are lovely and attentive. Faultless service, great venue, excellent value for money, a perfect experience.

The complimentary continental breakfast [coffee, tea, juices, cold hard boiled eggs, cereals, bagels/bread via the slowest toaster known to man, yogurts, oranges/apples and some breakfast pastries with a self serve waffle maker Sun] was quite adequate but seating limited - easy to take tray up to one's room. Complimentary internet near elevators with 2 computers and free printing was nice touch. Available internet connection in one's suite. The complimentary shuttle to T-stops and major shopping centre was helpful - most of the drivers were quite pleasant and helpful.

That was, and is, always my big gripe with any hotel. They always give me a room above a bar, or next to the generator room, or next to a convention room that's having a bachelor party. My bad, need to learn to ask. So the cons: 1. The area is not so nice and really doesn't accommodate a family walking to a restaurant nearby or entertainment nearby... gotta take a shuttle or a taxi. There are panhandlers and gang graffiti about - not too comfortable walking my 4 year old around. The establishments nearby were garage rentals, gas stations, dry cleaners, etc. There are no nice views from any of the rooms. Ours overlooked a heavy equipment yard. 2. Also, one of the two front desk receptionists was none too friendly. I can't say she was unprofessional, because she did her job. But to get her to talk was like pulling teeth, and we got to the point where we were afraid to bother her. 3. One of those places you have to ask for a key to use the bathroom while in the lobby, waiting or having breakfast. So you have to wait in line, then ask, the return it. And twice in 2 days (remember I'm with a small child), the bathroom was being serviced, and we had to walk down into this basement and find our way to an unmarked bathroom door that never had soap. A little inconvenient. 4. The beds... ... horrible. And when we asked for an extra blanket they said they were \"out\". Pros: 1. The 3 men who shuttled the guests about were bar none with their friendliness, knowledge of the area and they're very willing to help. Loved them. 2. free shuttle to/from Museum of Fine Arts. Wonderful. 3. For the MOST part, (except for one), the staff was great. 4. GREAT complimentary breakfast. More than your usual fare when given a free meal. So, next time I'm in Boston, I think I'll get a place that's closer to downtown where one could walk around to restaurants, shops, events, etc., and a somewhat cleaner area, say, like near the Prudential Center.

The first time we tried to use the shower the water backed up in the tub. Upon calling the front desk a maintenance worker came quickly to attend to the problem, however, left a mess in the tub of hair and grime after telling us the problem had been a hairclog from previous customers. Gross. The dirt from the tub was then transfered to the toilet, floor and handle as he disposed of the clog. The room smelled a bit musty upon arrival and began to intensify by the end of the first afternoon. We specifically called ahead to ask about the shuttle service and spoke to the front desk directly and not the main best western phone number. We chose this hotel as we were told the shuttle takes us directly to Fanneil Hall and leaves every 20 minutes or so. When I called the front desk after arrival to find out when the next shuttle was leaving we had to wait 40 minutes for the shuttle and it only dropped us off at the Subway station down the street and did not take us to the listed location as we had confirmed. We would not have stayed at this location had we known this as other hotels in the area drop patrons off at predetermined locations in Boston, not just at the subway station. We also were not told that we were going to be dropped off at a Subway station until we loaded the bus and by that time did not have time to try to figure out what subway line we needed to take or how to do so. We were unable to understand the driver and another hotel patron was kind enough to give us his information and direct us where to go- something the hotel should have provided long before we loaded the shuttle. The continental breakfast was poorly run. Many customers were complaining at the length of time it took to prepare their breakfasts as the toaster took at least 5 mintes to toast and the organization of the breakfast caused patrons to go to different ends of the area for items that should have been grouped together. Cream cheese, for example, was not placed near the cutlery and so people had to push through to pick up necessary items. These issues caused the area to be too crowded to meet the needs of customers. The fruit was also quite damaged looking. Finally, cookies were supposed to be provided from 5-7pm and at 5:30pm when we arrived at the lobby there were not any left and we were told that no more would be provided. At the same time we tried to pour a cup of coffee that is supposed to be availabe 24/7 and there was not enough to pour a cup and when the front desk was notified the staff did not quickly tend to this issue either. The complimentary computers in the business centre were very slow to use. Patrons were waiting in the centre for others to finish using one computer rather than attempting to use the second computer as it was so slow and useless. I am truly not one to complain and am usually a fairly easy going individual. These issues, however, caused us to have a very poor outlook on this location and we will not be returning. Though some of the issues may seem like small insignificant problems it is often the small things that count in customer service and the way these small things are tended to. We were very disapointed by the level of customer service provided at this location and it will strongly keep us from recommending this location to others.

However, the attendant rudely retorted that since we made the reservations online, there was no upgrade available, and nothing we could do other than leave.

One night a hotel guest had all 4 of their car wheels stolen in the night even though they were parked on hotel property. Security does not exist. The hotel staff is quite rude and lazy. We asked for extra pillows and got them 4 hours later around midnight. The night clerk was so lazy that he couldn't even be bothered to find a cart for us to load our luggage at our 11pm check in. He was more interested in finishing his cigarette outside the main doors of the lobby and chatting with a friend. I would not recommend this property for a comfortable stay.", "Date": "August 24, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ireland", "Title": "\u201cGreat Value & Great Staff\u201d", "Author": "De2006", "ReviewID": "UR5636499", "Content": "needless to say i was a bit dubious about staying in this hotel after reading some of the reviews on tripadvisor. however, i was pleasantly surprised upon arrival. the staff were fantastic, so friendly and curteous, especially the receptionist, i think her name was melinda. she was extremely friendly. also, the shuttle bus is a great advantage to the hotel. not only was it always on time but each of the drivers were really helpful in pointing out landmarks or recommending some good bars and restaurants. the rooms were a great suprise. we had booked a junior suite, not really knowing what to expect. tha\u00c3\u00b1kfully all rooms have air con as boston was experiencing a heat wave during our stay. our suite was comfortable with 2 tv\u00c2\u00b4s, a microwave, fridge, sofa, king size bed and en suite. finally, i would not hesitate in recommending the best western roundhouse suites as a great place to stay for a break in boston. i look forward to returning at the next possible opportunity.", "Date": "August 21, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "united kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGood hotel, good price, friendly service\u201d", "Author": "plebbe", "ReviewID": "UR5620555", "Content": "I stayed here for three nights in August, paid 139 per night. Not bad at all, given the size of the room(s). Rooms, as I had access to a lounge and a bedroom. Plusses: clean, spacious, quiet, excellent service. For example, the hotel has a shuttle that takes guests into town. So, location is good. The shopping areas are accessible from Mass. Ave. I walked, but there are busses that take you straight into town, and there is the shuttle service organised by the hotel as well. The shuttle service to the airport was much cheaper than the taxi that I took from the airport to the hotel. In short, I don't see the points that the other reviewers are trying to make about location. Minusses: the only minus is the breakfast room. Please be on time, otherwise you may have to wait.

We asked the staff, and they said take it or leave it (which, since we already paid, meant we had to take it). Then, the shuttle service to the subway and area attractions that they proudly advertise was \"broke\" two of the three days we were there, and the other reviewers are correct that it's not a good neighborhood to walk around in.

We made our reservation over the web, and our first surprise is that the airport shuttle was not free. It cost us $35 from the airport.

You can imagine my surprise when I learned of the charge, as the website indicated there was a free shuttle. The rooms were pleasant. The area was about 1/2 mile from the nearest subway station, we had no problem walking during daylight, but the area would have prohibited it during the evening.

The king-size bed was very comfortable and there was also another large TV inside an armour. The continental breakfast was good - all sorts of cold breakfast foods, plus freshly cooked waffles, available in a very crowded lobby area.

We were a little concerned before leaving because of the other reviews we had seen. It is in a odd part of the city, where a medical centre, a neighbourhood and a warehouse district meet. However, the shuttle took us nearly everywhere we needed to go and the subway was only 10-15 minute walk. One night we walked back to the hotel from Fenway Park and took maybe 40 minutes. We did see panhandlers near our hotel, however coming from Toronto, that is a problem that all large cities have. I went out everyday and bought a newspaper and on couple of occasions walked back to the hotel in the evening. I was never confronted by one of these individuals. I walked by some, but nothing was ever said. We found the hotel itself to be a great bargin, with excellent rooms. Ours had a nice sitting area away from the beds, fridge and microwave. The staff was very helpful and friendly, especially the shuttle driver and the breakfast lady. The breakfast itself, for being billed as a continental, was very plentiful and had a wide selection of things. Anyone who has complained about this breakfast, does not know what a true continental breakfast usually consists of. If you are planning to go to Boston and spend your time in the immediate neighbourhood of your hotel than I wouldn't recommend this hotel.

We supposedly had guaranteed late arrival for a king non-smoking room. When we arrived about 10 pm, there was no free parking spots to be seen (luckily we found a spot on the street), and there was only 1 person working the very busy front desk. After quite a wait, we were told that the only room left was a smoking with 2 doubles, despite our guarantee (which I had also confirmed again). Given the hour, we took it. The room was clean, but the hallway did smell of smoke. In addition, the sofabed's springs were poking out, and not even my 8 year old could sleep in it. Why offer a sofabed that it not usable? Finally, although not hotel's fault, but we had a room overlooking the lumberyard across the way, and they began working with tractors and heavy machinery at 5 am!! Even though we were offered the possibiltity of changing rooms later the next day, we chose to move across town to the lovely and much quieter Doubletree at Expo Center, right on the water. The Roundtree couldn't guarantee a usable sofabed, and there was street construction all around the hotel. One sleepless night was enough for us! The complementary breakfast was nice, but there is very little room to sit in the dining area. I do not recommend this hotel unless you really need to be in the area.
