I have stayed in worst hotels and I have stayed in better hotels. I would say the restaurant is a hidden gem in this hotel. A great view of the Bosphorus, good food (especially the breakfast), and a server that took pride in his profession and went out of his way to serve you. They have paid internet onsite but you're better off going to one of the numerous internet cafes in the area as it was unreliable and slow. I rated the cleanliness poor because the entire hotel should have a thorough cleaning. The most important thing though was that the beds were comfortable and clean. The rooms are quite small (probably the smallest room I have stayed in) but I don't expect you will be spending much time in it other than when you're sleeping. The bathroom was very clean with lots of hot water and good pressure. Although it is out of the way behind the Sirkeci train station, you're within walking distance to the major sites in Sultanahmet and a tram stop is just around the corner. I do not know if there are boxes behind the front desk but there are no safes in the rooms. If you're looking for a budget (emphasis on the budget) hotel with comfortable and clean beds I would recommend the Eris.", "Date": "January 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sharjah, United Arab Emirates", "Title": "\u201cUncommon\u201d", "Author": "BandzolinoC", "ReviewID": "UR89014175", "Content": "A beautiful place in a lovely part of town, reminded me of the Adriatic.

So they shipped half of us off to nearby hotels that were scary dumps. For example, the hall light was down the hall and about the size of a Christmas tree light, so i had to feel for the keyhole. Room had no trash can or drinking glasses. Bathroom smelled of sewage. Only one sheet on the bed so I took one from another bed and saw the blood stains on the mattress. There are many good hotels in Istanbul. Tonight I've moved to Hotel Ada and it's wonderful at a reasonable price - and much quieter and closer to the major sights Stay here instead of at the Eris.", "Date": "September 26, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Riyadh, Saudi Arabia", "Title": "\u201cOne of the Worst ever\u201d", "Author": "45701", "ReviewID": "UR73658723", "Content": "The service too bad, no air conditioning, I really didn't sleep that night . don't waste your time and money here .", "Date": "August 3, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Rooms": "1", "Value": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney", "Title": "\u201cDon't do it to yourself!\u201d", "Author": "TJS912", "ReviewID": "UR61710966", "Content": "If you've ever really wanted to know what it would be like to sleep in an ashtray, book yourself in. The rooms here are pretty bad to say the least. To give it 1 star would be generous. Apart from the intense smell of cigarette smoke, the sheets, furniture and bathroom date back to Byzantine times and have seldom been cleaned since. The restaurant on the top floor need not be there at all. They certainly don't need a menu as nothing on it was available to order (which I dare say was probably a good thing). I fervently recommend that you feed elsewhere or not at all. To top off my stay, a curious member of staff was opportunistic enough to steal USD$160 from an envelope that was hidden deep in my backpack, locked away in my room. Management were less than helpful, to the point of not caring at all.
