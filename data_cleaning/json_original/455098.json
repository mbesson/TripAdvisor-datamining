I must say the cleaning staff and the restuarant and kitchen staff were lovely , very friendly and polite. there was also a lovely security guard who made it feel very safe and very kind talkative porter. the room was cleaned every day and was a good size. the hotel itself was in a good location for it price just minutes from the metro allowing excellent links to the main parts of dubai. you are able to buy a day pass on the metro which takes you anywhere for about \u00a32.50 We did struggle to find any resturant in the area around the hotel and ended up eating down town. which did mean our halfboard was pretty pointless because by the time we had got in to the main bit of dubai, it was to long to get back to the hotel. so in that respect i would recomend going b&b. The food which was included in the package ( half board) wasnt great... at breakfest, it was quite limited with toast cereals, boiled eggs and chips and sausage ?? some days. and lunch was mainly just curry and rice and potato. the room service food seemed good though options such as salads and pizzas and deserts. we had this twice and found it very nice. we were on the 4th floor at the front we didnt really suffer from any noise. even though the hotel has 2 night clubs. the hotel has a very small pool on the roof which we didnt actually use as everytime we went up someone was in it. and it is pretty small but the roof space was nice to have a rest in the sun. this has been a bit of a mixed review but i hope it helps you all. in general the hotel was nice.", "Date": "February 15, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Athens, Greece", "Title": "\u201ci didn't like it\u201d", "Author": "prkark", "ReviewID": "UR122752871", "Content": "very small rooms, the service was slow very poor breakfast very noise", "Date": "January 8, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cBest location with acceptable price\u201d", "Author": "Almusafer", "ReviewID": "UR120608086", "Content": "I stayed 6 days in this hotel.

I flew out there not knowing what to expect. It was incredible flying in from London, Dubai looks absolutely beautiful from the sky, the lights are incredible. I've never been more in awe of anything. It was a manic, hot taxi drive into Dubai from the airport but it wasnt far, when we got outside the hotel it looked pretty nice, it had beautiful steps and a beautiful entrance hall. The rooms were nice, had a beautiful bathroom and bedroom. the view from the window was fine, it was of the city. the rooms got very hot so you would put the air con on but then it got too cold so you'd have to adjust the heat during the night. My favourite part of the hotel was something we found two days into the stay and i wish we found it sooner. On the roof was a beautiful swimming pool, it was small but there was a lovely sunbathing area and the views were incredible. The swimming pool was often empty and my boyfriend and I often were the only ones in it. it wasnt open until very late, i think about 6 o clock, which was disappointing when we got back late from shopping or whatever. Apart from recommending the hotel i would 100% recommend Dubai it was the most incredible holiday i have ever been lucky to go on.

As it was only for 2 nights, it was not so important if it was not a fantastic hotel, but what appealed to me was that one guest said that they were able to check in early, and as we were planning on getting there at 8 a.m., we opted for it. It was only when we were about to land that we realised that I had made an error with the booking, and my booking was for 2 days from the date I planned to check out. We explained to the front desk who told us the matter could be fixed easily if they received the confirmation from lastminute.com (where we had booked) and that we should check-in. In the evening when we got back to the hotel, we were told we would have to pay the rack rate (twice the price almost of the internet price) if they did not get the confirmation from lastminute.com. I was very displeased about this, as I had told them in the morning that if there was a problem our taxi driver could easily find us an hotel if there was a problem. I had to go to a phone booth eventually and managed to contact lastminute.com who sent a fax to them and sorted out the problem. I could then relax again. They could have tried to be a bit more helpful, even if the mistake was made by me. Nevertheless, I must say that we were very pleased with the hotel, our room and its location. We stayed in a 4 star hotel in Rome last year and this was much better than that hotel! We had a refrigerator, but no coffee or tea making facilities. We asked for a room on the top floor to avoid the noise from the discotheques and thus had 2 good nights of sleep.Breakfast was fine for the price. As an additional service to its guests, the hotel arranges a complimentary shuttle to the airport. Let the reception know what time your flight is, and they will try to accommodate your requests.

There are two nightclubs in the hotel but I have to say we never heard anything from them. Like a lot of hotels in Dubai right now, the Eureka is in the middle of a construction site. One night we had a delivery of cement going on until 3am outside our window. If you're a light sleeper I would give it a miss until July or so, maybe a lot of the work will be done by then.

From the moment we arrived, we were welcomed warmly and rooms given to us promptly. We stayed for a week and can quite safely say that we all enjoyed it really well!! Pool may not be Olympic size but was clean and private. The gym was rather lacking though and a bit bare. Rooms clean and tidy. Space was limited but not too much trouble after a liltle organising of clothes and luggage. Bathroom was clean, however, was a little rusty around the bath handles. At night, the in-house Indian club can be a little loud and floors 1,2 & 3 definitely heard a thump of bass till 3am in the morning, so I suggest if you decide to stay here, try and get yourself higher than these floors. The staff became really good friends with us and always loved a chat when we came in and out from the hotel to the extent that I was even given a telephone number from the Car Park attendant to call him anytime the next time we came to stay in Dubai. Breakfast Bar - basic but enough to fill you up in a morning. Location: Literally 7mins from the Airport after timing myself. Close to the Clock Roundabout. Also is a 2min walk from Al Riqqa Road, which was known as 'The Place to be,' when Dubai began developing. Tonnes of restaurants and coffee shops down one side and shops down the other. Fantastic at night, though can be very busy with traffic at night. Next to the hotel is mini-market so dirt cheap food, snacks, toiletries, pots and pans anything and everything! Next to that is the Dry Cleaners and a 2min walk down the street will lead you to a post office, so great for sending post cards. Overall, we had a really nice time and if you're not expecting too much from a 2Star hotel and on a budget then this place is recommended - Also a very important note: On Wednesday 31st May 2006, the hotel was under new management who are expected to give the hotel a brush over.

It so happens the taxi driver I took from the airport was familiar with this hotel and did not need the barely readable map I printed from the website. I asked what this hotel was like with enthusiasm but his distant look in the rearview mirror at me in the backseat along with a pause and sigh said it all. He finally answered, \"it's clean.\" Once arriving at the hotel it was nice on the outside but not nearly as large of a lobby as the online picture suggest and the room nearly made me cry. My first comment to the bellman was, \"it's really small!\" When I thought about it even the elevator was exceptionally small carrying 4-5 average size adults comfortably. It had an old closed up and slightly moth like smell to it prompting me to open the window and burn a scented candle. It was the middle of the night and changing hotels was not an option after a 22 hour flight. The obvious renovations would better be described as redecorations. The handles in the bathtub were rusted on each side, the shower leaked onto the bathroom floor. There was just under 2 feet of space between the tub and sink. You do better to bring your own soap products though they did provide small bars (extremelly small). The food was okay to good. The staff was nice and I have to say the bed was comfortable as far as the mattress but the pillows were too soft offering no support and gave me neck problems. When the housekeeper arrived I had to leave the room. There was not enough space for both of us at the same time especially if you have large luggage pieces. In all of my travels I have never seen a hotel room so small and I've been all over the world but on top of everything else they want to hold your passport. This was by no means my first trip to the Middle East and in particular Dubai and the front desk staff always take a picture of the information page on my passport for their records but I immediately receive my passport back into my possession. The Eureka staff wants to hold onto the physical passport until they receive clearance from the police you have no criminal record. I assured them they had my money and I was no flight risk but I will NOT be in this country without my passport in my hand. Finally they gave it back to me. I do not recommend this hotel to anyone and definitely not if you are looking for luxury. I assummed it to be a boutique hotel by the advertising, it is not. M.B.P.

The gym and the pool are non functional in the hotel and gym has only one machines and the pool can accommodate only two persons, so you cant expect this facility. However the best part was the breakfast, it was fabulous, and the sales manager was nicest person, i have all appreciation for them.", "Date": "January 25, 2005"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Eureka", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g295424-d455098-Reviews-Hotel_Eureka-Dubai.html", "Price": "$83 - $109*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Abu Baker Al Siddique Road (D 78 Rd)</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\">Deira</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Dubai</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">64103</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">United Arab Emirates</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "455098", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/87/66/876658efd2c08707566ec74f309476e13large.jpg"}}
