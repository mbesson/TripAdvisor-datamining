The service is always perfect, I feel like the social elite because of the atmosphere and attentive service. I LOVE the food here too. I've experienced the high tea, a la carte menu at the Cafe Opera and the all you can eat buffet at the same restaurant. In fact I used to come to Sydney just to have the buffet here. The food is always great, the waiters are attentive and friendly and after I eat I feel wonderfully content! I wish I could have this feeling all the time! Unfortunately, everything really is expensive. In fact for me it's fairly unaffordable which is why I only get to go here when it's my birthday because my family will treat me to a stay here. I'm incredibly envious of people who are able to afford to stay here regularly. I'm considering chatting up a few people who frequent the bar here to find out what area of employment they are in and get myself into that field asap! Oh, the views and location are also worth a mention. I've had views of Watson Bay, the Botanical Gardens and the Harbour Bridge, all stunning whichever you choose. The last time I stayed here I even got to see fireworks shooting up from Watsons Bay! So romantic! Just a note, I've only ever stayed in the 20th floor and above, so I do not know if the lower levels have good views or if they're blocked by buildings, so if possible, ask for something above 20. It's also seriously close to food, transport, shopping.....just everything! I love it! The beds are ridiculously comfortable and I love that the controls for the blinds and lights are next to the bed. Also, something that I always encounter is that I end up boiling hot and sweating at night under the blankets they provide, no matter how much I cool the room. Well, that's something that I could easily fix by removing the blanket, but I'd love to know what they've got in those blankets to make them retain heat so well! Finally, there is an odd window in the bathroom that opens up. I have no idea what it's for! If you're outside the bathroom you can still open this window and watch the person inside do their business. Is this a design flaw or designed for kinky couples in mind? I always use it to watch TV from the bathroom, but I've always wondered why they're in every room. All in all, you will not be disappointed by staying here. Well worth the price if you can afford it. My birthday is coming up in a few days; I'm keeping my fingers crossed that a family member will take pity and spoil me again with a stay here!", "Date": "April 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Perth, Australia", "Title": "\u201cAll the comforts\u201d", "Author": "Kitkat071", "ReviewID": "UR128198472", "Content": "We stayed here for four nights after a 24 hour flight.

We booked the east harbour view room which was advertised as a \"seasonal offer\" including buffet breakfast and complimentary valet parking. On our booking form I ticked for a 2pm check in, but I am fully aware that check in is 3pm and had hoped that the room would be ready earlier for us to enjoy it. At 2pm when we tried to check in we were advised that the room was not yet ready and that check in was at 3pm, so as the staff had my mobile number and said that they would ring us as soon as it was ready we headed to the bar for a couple of drinks. At $25 for a cocktail and $10 for a Jim Beam and coke it gets expensive after a couple of drinks, so at 3pm I went back to reception to check on our room. Another 20 minutes I was told, they are doing the room now, \"we'll ring you shortly.\" At 3.45pm my wife was getting fidgety and again went to reception to enquire and she was told that the room was finished but needed to be inspected before we could have it and it would be about 15 or 20 minutes but they would ring us. We then went for a walk and ended up at Circular Quay and an hour later still no phone call. We headed back to find out what was happening and were advised at 5pm that the room was ready, but as it was a different girl on reception she had no idea that we had been waiting and had not been advised to ring us. I asked \"Can you tell me why it took so long\" and received no explanation, the girl didn't seem to know why, so we left it at that and headed up to our room 1605 which was fantastic. I just put it down to us being a one off, one night Wotif buyer and other guests paying more or staying longer would be looked after first. You get what you pay for type of thing. We left the hotel for drinks and dinner and upon our arrival back later that night we discovered a hand written apology note and a plate of chocolates as a gesture of good will which was graciously accepted. The bedding was very good, even though it was 2 single beds pushed together, with great pillows and everything was very clean. Breakfast was really nice in Cafe Opera, good service and plenty to choose from.

I was connected to a person with an American accent so I presumed that I had been directed to a central booking agency. I advised that I was an Ambassador member of Intercontinental and wanted an executive room with harbour view for 3 nights. The agent advised that only city views were available. I asked what room I would get with my Ambassador upgrade entitlement. I was advised that I would be upgraded to a Harbour View Suite. I accepted this information and confirmed the booking. The operator then said that she would transfer me to a special Ambassador member number. I then received a recorded message telling me to call back during office hours (come on Intercontinental - call this customer service?). There was no information given on office hours. Being now suspicious I telephoned Sydney Intercon on expensive telephone rates from Perth. The reservations person then advised that I would definitely NOT be upgraded to a harbour view suite. Image my indignation if I had turned up at the hotel and not received the upgrade that I had been told I would get. The operator than said that harbour view executive rooms were available (why was central reservations not aware of this?). All in all a poor show Intercontinental.

However I will hold this action if I get a reasonable response from Intercon on why this mess occurred. For persons holding Ambassador level at Intercontinental which they purchased for $200 or so, be aware that central reservations do not hold current information on room availability. Further be aware that the guaranteed room upgrade appears to be a 'smoke and mirrors' exercise.

I was attending a conference in Sydney during the week and my wife joined me for the final two days of the stay. This was the first time I had stayed at this hotel - we usually stay at the Four Seasons or the Westin. I would rate my arrival as a 1 out of 10. It was not busy at Reception and the Receptionist who checked me in was quite surly. There was certainly no 'Welcome to the InterContinental Hotel.\" It was very matter of fact and here's your key. I was surprised at the small size of the room, particularly the bathroom. The shower was in the bath tub with a plastic shower curtain. Also, the bathroom had only 1 sink. I was expecting more for a Club King room. The king sized bed was the smallest king size bed I have ever slept in and for me, was not that comfortable. My wife found the bed to be very comfortable. After my very unwelcoming reception experience and my initial impressions of the room, I wished at that point, I had kept my booking at the Four Seasons. Room service was OK. I ate in the room for three of the nights. On every occassion the person taking the order over-promised and under-delivered. Each night they told me that it would be up in 30-35 minutes. On two of the nights it was 50 minutes plus before the food was delivered. But the longer I stayed at the hotel, the more I enjoyed it. The view was incredible - these Opera House rooms face the harbour and look straight out onto the Opera House and Harbour Bridge. The location is down the Circular Quay end of town. It was probably about a fifteen minute walk to the main shops in the centre of town. But this location is very convenient if you are going to travel on the Sydney ferries to the beatiful surrounding areas and attractions like Watson's Bay, Taronga Zoo, Double Bay & Manly. The Club lounge was interesting. Staff were very professional, friendly and generally attentive. Breakfast buffet was just like any other basic buffet - nothing special here. Afternoon tea comprised a selection of small cakes, scones and some finger sandwiches. The evening cocktails were served from 5.00 pm to 7.00 pm - the views were amazing from the Club lounge at this time of day. There is a menu of drinks to choose from - if you deviate from that list you then pay for what you order (I have never struck this before) - there is no champagne on the list - that was $30+ per glass. There is no food put out to help yourself - you are served a chef's platter of 3 different hors d'oeuvres at your table - that is it. The hors d'oeuvres were consistently good and very well presented and each hors d'oeuvre was explained by a very polite young waiter with a great French accent. We have enjoyed many club lounges over the years - this one was the most unusual in terms of their offering. Rod Stewart and his family were staying here during his Syndey concerts and we saw them in the Club lounge for breakfast. The Club lounge always seemed very hot - it felt like the air-conditioning was not working. Overall, we enjoyed our time at this hotel.

We had just joined the Ambassador program using our points. We also stayed two years ago with my husband\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s boss with me booking the accommodation as I had always wanted to stay at the Intercontinental. I have to say the first experience was great and thankfully left an impression on our bosses as well. We were only talking about it the other day and they remarked that it was the best hotel they have stayed in Sydney. We were hoping with our booking in January for a repeat experience and it was so much better than we anticipated and I have high standards. We also just joined as Ambassador members as well so were looking forward to the extra touches especially the late checkout of 4pm. We were on a package that included breakfast and valet parking. Can I just say the breakfast was out of this world. It was such a sensory experience. The best breakfast we have ever had. I honestly could not stop touching and looking at everything and next time will pause on the coffee to have later at the end of my breakfast. To other guests go early and leave time to really enjoy. It was so different to the breakfast we have a few years earlier. A great investment as it was the highlight of our stay. I cannot remember the name of those yoghurts and must as they were in such cute bottles, organic and the farmers deserve so much credit. To those staying try and stay on a package with breakfast included as it really is a must you will not be disappointed. It does appear expensive if you were paying for it not included in a package but after going there I now beg to differ. An improvement would be to have the staff in sections as we went early and at times I felt the staff was hovering yet they were always very polite. I must admit being an experienced traveller I did Google trip advisor and was surprised the comments weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t better. I was taken aback that customer service seemed an issue. When everyone takes the time to go away you just want it to be such a great experience as time is really precious. Well I can honestly say we were blown away. Our room was ready for us an hour earlier. I requested a high floor and though it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t as high as I would have liked the room number I now believe is what counts. We were in 1401 and the views were spectacular. As Ambassador members we received complimentary fruit and bottled water, there was a Mind/Body magazine and a surprise - a beautiful bottle of red wine. This was a really nice touch as everyone likes surprises and if management are reading this it is really nice as most people who become Ambassadors know what extras to expect and to have a surprise well everyone needs more of those in life and it was a really nice touch. The only suggestion is before saying the room is ready is to ensure these are in the room prior to showing the guests as people will have expectations and then enter and in my mind I was thinking where are the extras. I said to my husband let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just go out and I am sure they will be there when we return and sure enough they were. However, a better approach would be not to leave the guest wondering in the first place as first impressions count. We went to Jamie\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Italian that night which was fantastic, finishing off at the Intercontinental as I love the interior where you can have a nightcap. It was great not to rush the next morning so the choice of a late checkout is a great idea and feels like we had more time away and will encourage us to be back for another short weekend soon. Can I just say as repeat Ambassadors try and keep up that element of surprise for our next trip and for other travellers as it really made a difference? I have to also say I found the staff always polite and always smiling. I understand others may have had a different experience but we could not really fault the service. We had a sneak peak at the club level and would really like to try this next time but want to have breakfast downstairs as I am itching to go back for this experience alone. It was truly a great two days away and felt like longer. Thank you and we hope it is just as good next time.

Instead I choose the regular club room and was delighted when we were upgraded due to my Ambassador Intercontinental membership.

Service was great, check-in and out was exceptional, valet was great as expected and again the Club was wonderful. The regular room- still Club level again had an exception view of Opera and Harbour but was on the smaller side-however due to proximity, I would choose it again. The Club it quite large with ceiling to floor glass walls- it has an outside wrap around deck with table chairs outside for unbelievable views of Sydney. Though drinks are only complimentary during the hors doerves hours, one can order drinks and even dinner and charge to room at any time. Breakfast was included and was great. The only thing I would do to improve would be to have self serve coffee.

To put it lightly the place was jaw dropping over the top fabulous! It is my wife\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s favorite room to which all others are measured. There was a club on the 30th floor for club floor rooms. Drinks and snacks are offered during cocktail hours. Service is very slow and one can only order drinks and orders one at a time from a very slow waiter. The next night we just had wine in our suite and avoided waiting. The Governors suite was much more comfortable than the club anyway. The hotel is located easy walking distance to the opera house and Sydney harbor. We visited Australia when a USD yielded 1.27 AUD, so rates at the hotel were reasonable. With the AUD as strong as it is we are avoiding Sydney as things are much more expensive and we do not find good travel value there. The Governors suite is still our favorite suite, thus far, in the world, and the hotel staff (except at the club) are excellent.

The intercontinental lived up to expectation despite its position on the block and strange entrance and exit from the street. My taxi driver was a newbie and didn't drop me off at the lobby, so it wasn't just me. Despite this, the hotel is PERFECTLY situated for all the wonderful places you want to see in Sydney and made an ideal base for all my walking tours around downtown. With Hyde Park, The Domain, the Museum, Circular Quay, the Opera House, The Rocks, and every other highlight within sight of the hotel (literally used the building for navigation), I was able to cover the entire downtown, night and day, from the location just blocks from the touristy craziness of the Quay, to the peaceful and beautiful sculptures in Hyde Park, I can't remember when I have enjoyed a stay so much. The room itself was compact (regular king) but very stylish and well thought out. My three tenets of travel were more than covered; noise (nonexistent), sheets/bedding ( superb!), and towels/bath (thick and adequate). There was a nice touch for a news hound like myself. In the bath, there was a tv speaker and a small window that you could open to watch the market news while shaving. All my meals and entertainment were outside the hotel, so cannot comment on the restaurants, but the smells in the lobby hinted of a delicious meal or two. Beyond that, I cannot say enough about the good people of Sydney. I so completely enjoyed my weekend, due in large part to the happy, smiling, cordial people of Australia. Despite traveling by myself, I never felt alone or wanting for company.

So upon checking in at the Club level of the hotel with the stunning Sydney Harbour Bridge and Opera House as our background, it was even more stunning to find that our upgrade was in fact to a State Suite, a further level higher than expected. The State Suite was huge, occupying a corner of the hotel on the 30th Floor, with a separate living room that afforded post card views of the harbour, the bridge, the opera house and the heads. The suite also had a baby grand piano, perfect for budding song writers in need of inspiration or perhaps a private gathering with a pianist - I'm sure the options are endless. The living room could easily accommodate a private soiree, or an intimate dinner for 6 such is its flexibility. Adding to the ambience of the Baby Grand is the Bose surround sound system with iPod/phone dock. The Suite amenities are also upgraded from the mini bar inside a larger fridge in its own galley kitchen, the upgraded Chopard personal amenities to the complimentary spirit and wine selection (750ml bottles). A separate toilet, walk in wardrobe, spa bath and twin vanities round out the Suite design. These are \"Club\" suites so when staying in one of these rooms you'll have access to the Club located on the 31st Floor of the hotel with views of the city, the harbour and the city's east. Whatever the superlatives used, they all fit. Simply one of the most iconic views in Australia. Could talk about the view all day..... The staff were friendly and attentive although not engaging and I was never addressed by name (and no...I'm not important - it's a comment based on previous club experiences around the world) and although a couple of the staff knew and recognised us when we returned to the club other staff did not. Apart from that, the food quality (Breakfast, morning and afternoon tea and pre-dinner hors d'ouvres), the table service, the coffee and other drinks, all delivered without any problems. We enjoyed dinner at the Opera Cafe (full restaurant service), lovely ambience, excellent menu choice and best of all excellent food quality. Highly recommend this restaurant even if it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a little pricey but that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Sydney! Room service food was equally good, the Signature \"Club Sandwich\" was wonderfully tasty and it was delivered hot and in good time. Recommend that as well!! Okay, that was all the good stuff.... These suites retail on the IC website for $2900 per night (2012) and whilst I am certain you could get them cheaper via alternative channels there are a couple of things that let the room and the hotel down. First up is the internet. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s patchy in the suite and it is NOT included in the rate. You'll get $50 bottles of alcohol included but you will have to pay some $20 per day for the internet. Yep I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get it either. Just ask at check-out to have it waived. My guess is they will. The king bed in our suite needed replacement. The pillow top was very ordinary and the bed also seemed a little short - may have been my eyes.... No slippers, we had to request them. An oversight maybe. A phone system that was impossible to know how to work (good thing they had an old style one as well) and with no instructions that I could find. A very very noisy fridge and some traffic noise from the expressway on the bedroom side. From the loyalty point of view, no welcome letter. All that aside (it may have been an off day), much of which will not affect every traveller, this Intercontinental is in a great location close to the Ferries, the city centre and a 15 minutes\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 walk to the rocks. I would recommend the suites to those who were looking for an option for a private dinner party, an intimate honeymoon option (although for the price you could probably go OS), or perhaps an intimate wedding. A romantic stay would also suit. It certainly has the view. Would I stay again?

One minor downside is the occasional 'bike' wrooms on the express way. First time I heard the noise in a star hotel and I believe there should be some problem with window seal/vacuuming. Service is great and beat my expectations.

Most of the tourist destinations in Sydney can be reached via public transport and If you want to rely on the public transport the nearest busstop is around 10 min walk. The Train station is 800 meters away so you can say 10min for the train as well. Both Wynyard & Circular quay stations are within walkable distance.

Plentiful coffee and cold juices make for a great start to the day. This time a real breakfast favourite was slow roasted smoked bacon, cut thickly from the loin. Prunes flavoured with star anisse and cinnamon were a delightful exotic touch. And only in Australia does one get a cool guava juice that is almost syrup it is so thick. The Cortille on the ground floor remains one of the most enjoyable venues In Sydney for a drink to start and evening on the town but if you want something light to eat at the other end of the night the kitchen is likely to have closed, something that lets the experience down a little.

Our room was not ready until 3.30pm and then the room had a blocked toilet. It would have been impossible for the cleaners not to be aware of this. Our room swipe card would not work and we had to go to reception and wait and get another one. Next our club floor swipe wouldn't work either and we had to get that redone. We paid more for a club floor room. This is a total waste of money and would like to warn people about it. Firstly, they allow people to smoke cigars. Yes can you believe it. We couldn't. We were trying to eat our breakfast on the terrace and had foul cigar smoke in our face. We moved. The problem is, they don't have enough tables and chairs to cater for guests and even admit this. Although you have paid extra to go to the club floor, there may not be enough room and you can't enjoy the terrace because they allow smoking while you are eating breakfast, or afternoon tea. On both occasions to this hotel the eggs and bacon have been stone cold. We contacted the general manager of this hotel and his response was excuse after excuse after excuse. He couldn't care less that we were kept awake all night by the service door that staff allowed to bang all night and where they talked disturbing the rooms just a few feet away. On the ground floor there is a lounge and we saw cheesecake and other cakes left unrefrigerated and when you order this is what you get. The hotel has rooms very close to the lifts and you can see big gaps under the doors. It is very noisy in those rooms. Then if you are further down, you have the service door banging all night and staff coming in and out. One final thing, we could not get over how for the price of the room, you had to climb into a bath to have a shower and you had a nasty plastic shower curtain. Oh my goodnesss, those things don't exist anymore we thought. Well at the Intercontinental they do. You have a shower in a bath with a shower curtain that puts water everywhere. Also the toilet is right next to the curtain. The bathrooms are the smallest bathrooms we have encountered. As if you could use the bath, knowing that was everyone's shower where people stand.

The rooms are very big, and if you're facing the bridge or the east, you have great views. Have never been on the other two sides. I think it has been said that the bathrooms are nothing wow, and that is true. Definitely dated, but always clean. But I would not say that the hotel seems dated at all, it feels fresh and friendly. One big downside is the lack of Wi-fi.

We wanted to have a cocktail in the rooftop bar but were told that we had to be members of their special club (Ambassador Club I think it was called) to access their rooftop bar - we could join for $150 - very arrogant attitude. We were meeting a friend who took customers to her home local Intercontinental Hotel restaurant for very expensive meals on the corporate bill - their local Intercontinental hotel had arranged for her to access the Sydney rooftop bar after 8pm and we went there for a drink. There were only a few people up there and there was no entertainment on a Saturday evening - the view was spectacular (much better than the view from our room). Cocktails were around $25 however the staff were to busy to bring us some nibblys as they were to talking amongst themselves and preparing for the next morning's Ambassador Club members breakfast which is held up in the rooftop bar area! We ate breakfast downstairs with all the other normal people. The only time the staff provided us with any service was to take your order, bring you your order or bring you your bill! This hotel lives in a different world - overall poor value (a normal cup of coffee downstairs was $7-how much harder can you rip-off people), poor service, arrogant attitude and make people who stay in their most expensive (non-suite) rooms feel like they should go somewhere else - which is exactly what we will do next time as there are several 5 star hotels in the same area. I would have thought that it is exactly those (high paying) customers that they would have wanted back again - we are actually amazed at their attitude.

As we were driving we really appreciated the valet service, especially after navigating Sydney's CBD, we were greeted with a friendly smile and offer to take our bags and an attendant dealt with the car. Looking a little worse for ware after our 11 hour drive from Brisbane we were made to feel very welcome and were impressed with the quick check in process having arrived at the time we could check in 1500hrs. Without having requested we were accommodated in a high floor corner room (which we preferred) and immediately we knew we had made the right choice. The room had a great feel of luxery, nice view of the city and spacsious bathroom, everything was clean and climate was optimal without being too cold or warm. Very quickly after arriving we received our bags and the days local paper which I meant to read but unfortunately didn't chance to because once I layed down on the bed I was asleep, the mattress being so comfortable with the right amount of pillows - honeslty have to say the best hotel bed I have slept in for ages. I was concerned after reading some other reviews on this property that noise could be an issue, but other than hearing our neighbours entering and exiting their room we found it pleasantly quiet. After a quick kip we decided to check out the scenary and realised what a great location the hotel is, circular quay is metres away. Knowing that we were coming back to Sydney for a culinary tour in a few weeks we chanced trying the room service available at the Intercontinental. My partner had the club sandwich while I had the rib fillet plus desserts of tiramisu and creme brule - all were substantial in size, quality and were above most restaurant offerings in Brisbane. We had an early Sunday morning buffet breakfast which was a steal at $15 in the Opera Cafe. Everything on offer was fresh, hot and great varitey of fruits, pastries, cerals as well as favourites like sausage, bacon and the best hotel poached eggs. We are glad we came early because by the time we left at 8.30 the area was filling fast with people. Check out was smooth and easy, although unexpectidly the car arrived while I was still finalising the bill, my partner had to circle the block as we were blocking the laneway to let cars out.

However, it is no longer as busy as it used to be probably due to the influx of other hotels to the area. Thus the lobby cocktail lounge (a most pleasant spot) is almost a ghost town and it used to have a 100 people milling around.

The latter is the best ever for us. Room has everything you may need. Watch out for the food and laundry prices - sky high.

An all day winery tour with 2 wineries visited, a ridiculous cheese place visit and a strange lunch. Thanks heavens we had arranged tours on our own in advnace which were excellent.

The rooms are a little tired and dated as is the bathroom. Had trouble with the shower pressure also. The beds were comfortable enough but i found was a little hit and miss depending on what room you ended up with. The club lounge breakfast is great but the evening is a real let down. You get one tasting plate and that is it. Nothing else is bought around, you cannot even go and help yourself to some food, there is nothing, except for some olives and nuts. Unless you are in their face the whole time asking for more drinks, on the busy nights you are forgotten. I once sat in the lounge for over 2 hours and was only offered a drink when I arrived. Despite the many staff that always seem to be running around looking busy no-one cleared my table or offered me another drink. Its pretty poor. The view from the lounge is spectacular and is basically what sells this hotel. As a Royal Ambassador you come to expect a certain level of service and recognition. Here I found you get none. They in my opinion don't value RA's and seem to have their own loyalty scheme going. Normally I would recommend people join the ambassador program as you get treated well and get room upgrades. The only word I could use to describe their attitude is mean. For example, on a stay where every suite type they have available was bookable when I checked in, they refuse to upgrade to suite. Other IC properties routinely upgrade RA's to suites but not here, here you get a 'view' room half obstructed by a building. If you have never stayed here, you may want to still give this hotel a go, but I know i definitely will not be back there and a number of my colleagues who travel often will give it a miss too. I have tried time and time again to give this hotel a go even thinking things would get better with the management change but sadly in my opinion it has not. Its a crowded Sydney hotel market, and with so many really great high end ones it is easy to give this one a miss.", "Date": "July 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney, Australia", "Title": "\u201clovely\u201d", "Author": "backspaced", "ReviewID": "UR115464831", "Content": "We stayed at this hotel on our Priority Privilege.

The hotel is good, but it's getting close to where it needs to be refurbished. They have a 3ft cord for your computer, as there is no wi-fi in the room. I asked for a longer cord and they made one for me. It definitely made things easier when I would sit in bed and look things up. Internet is definitely on the expensive side...$25/day. I wanted to do some unique things on my trip and their concierge really made it enjoyable. They set me up on a sea plane ride that showed me the coast and took me to a 7 course meal at a beautiful restaurant. They also made reservations for the Harbor bridge climb. I'd highly recommend that you do both! You're within walking distance of Circular Quay, the Harbor Bridge, and the Opera House.

The room was quite nice although when I sent a photo of it to my fiancee she cheekily suggested it was designed \"by a guy\". It wasn't exactly lush but I thought it was quite nice. Certainly there was more than enough room for one person. I found the staff to be outstanding...from check-in to housekeeping to the people working the Club Lounge upstairs. When I checked in I forgot that I was leaving a day later....when I called back to correct that I was told that my final night would be added at a cheaper rate than I'd booked. I appreciate that kind of customer service. The Club level was very satisfactory for breakfast....the staff were amazing. There was one morning on the holiday Monday Queen's birthday when I faced a massive lineup but other than that family holiday the Club room was relatively empty and the food and service were worthy of praise. The bed is quite comfortable and if you book a suite you will have enough pillows to put everybody in Sydney to sleep. Internet charges were better than I expected....fifty dollars for six nights. Ordered laundry service and it was taken and delivered back within five hours. I must complement the staff...from the front desk to housekeeping to the taxi area. Even in the hallways, you always have a \"good morning\" or similar greeting from staff. Always nice. This is a very professional hotel with staff hired to provide that level of service. It is, however, quite expensive at the level I booked. There is an IGA store across the street in the AMP building if you need supplies and you're steps from Circular Quay for many convenience stores or bottle shops. I would think the Intercontinental would be one of the best places to stay in Sydney if you are on business. If you're holiday bound....it is a little too placed in the business district...but it's a 15 minute walk to the Pitt Street shopping area and Sydney offers amazing public transit options.

The pool is small though, so don't expect to do any laps in it. The gym is also quite small, and you might find it difficult to get a machine to work out on at certain times. The location is the best part of this hotel, only a five minute walk down to the Opera House and the harbour.

I wanted to share a couple of tips for future travelers. First, if you travel frequently and plan to use some points at this hotel prepare to stay on the first floor (actually floor 11) without a view. It really doesn't matter if you are a platinum member or not. The rooms with the lower room number (1-10) seemed to have the better view. If you room ends in 20 you're viewing the air conditioning unit at the building next door. Requests for ice/towels were all met quickly. The employees were very cordial. The bed was extremely comfortable. Second, breakfast at this hotel can get expensive every single day. We visited the Museum of Sydney across the street and paid about half. They serve an excellent eggs benedict for about $17. Third, this hotel is close to Circular Quay so it makes travel very convenient. However, the station is at the bottom of the hill. The daily hikes to/from the hotel from Circular Quay can be exhausting in the heat. You can take two escalators by going through the building next door during business hours. Finally, we had a hard time finding a good place to eat lunch that was close to the hotel. We didn't discover the food court in the building next door lower floor (across the street right out the front door of the hotel) until a few days into our trip as it's not clearly marked or obvious. There is a grocery store located in the food court as well that is a lot cheaper than the surrounding convenience stores. Stock up on water/soda/snacks at this grocery. We found three great restaurants in town: Spice I Am (Surry Hills), Zaaffran Grill (Darling Harbour) and Lord Nelson Brewery(near the bridge). We visited both Manley and Bondi beaches and preferred Manley. We probably wouldn't make the trip to Bondi if we went back.", "Date": "March 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "galveston, texas", "Title": "\u201cA VERY NICE HOTEL - WE RECOMMEND THE CLUB LEVEL ROOMS\u201d", "Author": "GalvestonJT", "ReviewID": "UR98533395", "Content": "We just finished 4 nights in this luxury hotel in Sydney, Australia.

This is a lovely hotel, all the public areas are nice and clean and in good condition, the check in was quick and effiicient and the staff were all very friendly. Our room was large and clean and well equipped and the safe was free. The bed was huge and both the bed and the pillows were really comfortable and the blackout blinds were very useful in the morning. The bathroom was a little dated but was clean and had good shower products by Elemis, it did have a strange window that opened into the hotel room, not sure why that was??? The pool area was nice and had a fantastic view over the opera house, the pool was warm and not to deep and was quiet everytime that we visited. Also used the sauna and the changing rooms which were clean and pleasant. We only ate breakfast at the hotel, and we got this free with our room, it was buffett style and was yummy, however, not sure if i would have paid extra for it as you could get similar elsewhere for a lot cheaper. we did also use the ironing service for my partners suit, which although it was not cheap, he suit came back looking brand new and really quickly aswell. I also had my hair put up for a wedding in the salon, whilst I was happy with my hair style, the stylist was not the happiest or friendliest and for $75 for 15mins work he could have made a bit more of an effort. Our friend, the bride, had a gorgeous suite on the 31st floor (i think) which had amazing views over the opera house and the bridge, the only annoying thing was we couldn't go up and visit her as our room was on the 14 floor and our key cards would not let us up any higher than this, either by the lift or stairs! thought that this was a bit unnecessary. Our friend also had club access and we went up there as her guests for a drink, was fantastic sitting on the balcony/outside deck drinking beer overlooking the harbour in the sunshine, really enjoyed it, thouh not sure if I would have paid the extra money for it.

While certain aspects of the hotel did meet my expectations, its downfalls were bad enough to ensure I will never stay there again. We had booked a harbour-bridge-view room, so we were on the 21st floor and the view was spectular (including a partial view of the Opera House). However, the room smelt strongly of stale cigarette smoke. We spoke to the front desk about changing rooms, but they said they would have to move us to a lower room category on the 14th floor - no mention was made of a discount or upgrade. As a first option, they said they would send someone from housekeeping to freshen the room. After twenty minutes, someone did arrive - they opened the door without knocking, muttered something and then left. No one came back. On our way out to dinner, we mentioned this to the front desk and once again we were assured that someone from housekeeping would be sent to our room. When we got back from dinner, nothing had changed in the room so we assumed housekeeping did not visit. The other big let-down was the poor sound-proofing. The guests in the next room included small children who spent a lot of time screaming and not using their inside voices when talking to their parents. We mentioned this at the front desk and they said they would talk to the noisy neighbours. However, the noise levels remained the same, which is not hotel's fault, but they should properly sound-proof the rooms to begin with. To top it all off, when we checked out they tried to charge us for the room, even though we had paid online months ago. We tried pointing this out, but were informed that we had it wrong, and that there is no way our credit card would have been charged. Luckily we had a print-out of our booking receipt, but still this wasn't enough - they spent ages on the phone to the accounts department before conceeding that we had already paid for our stay.

After the first night I asked house keeping to put another mattress topper on the bed as I thought this might improve the comfort of the mattress - I was wrong! The IC could learn alot from the Westin regarding bedding. The staff are also very rude. When we first made it to the hotel, after some confusion about which driveway to enter, we drove straight down to the underground car park. The parking attendant was very rude and seemed annoyed with us and I saw him roll his eyes when I asked to collect one more thing from the car before they parked it. The service in the exec lounge is not geat. Drinks service is very slow, although the drinks menu is good. My husband was disappointed that there were only tasting plates and not a snack buffet. I left the lounge to go back to the room and get something and when I came back I was literally chased down for my room number, ironically by a staff member who had previously served me 3 drinks....

Either he wasn't or he didn't care because we had no contact from him or his assistants - not even a note in the room apologising for the service shortcomings.

My first impressions of the hotel were through the reception desk and lobby. The reception staff member was quite friendly and I was allowed an early check-in at about 10am. The lobby itself struck me as being quite small and not particularly grand or large for a hotel in this class but it was functional. The room seemed to be quite bland and average and the furniture and fittings didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t look overly impressive for a five-star hotel. Unfortunately, I could find dust in many parts of the room and particularly in the difficult-to-access areas such as under the TV and on the bedside cabinets. The room just didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem all that well integrated and welcoming, it looked like the various items had just been put together without much emphasis on how well they integrated. The quality of the furniture didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem high. The sofa seating directly next to the window was quite worn. The room also didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem to be very large. I had a slight problem with the room air-conditioning, as the air flow wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t quite sufficient even on a high setting. I was staying with a few relatives who were in a separate room and their room seemed to be much better ventilated on the same fan setting. The bathroom was quite small and couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really convey a sense of luxury. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in the same colour scheme as the Intercontinental Singapore but wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t as large and the overall quality was not as high. The bed itself was comfortable but I had a difficult first night, possibly due to the pillows being a little too soft. I had a better second night, probably because I was used to the room and environment more than anything else. Overall, if I was to compare the room here to that of the Intercontinental Singapore, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s clear that the room standard was a fair bit lower here. The room was smaller, the furnishings and bathroom were not as good as in Singapore and the overall sense of homeliness and ambience were just not quite there. Having said all that, the room did seem to come to life a little at night and the lighting created a much more intimate and special ambience at night-time. The view of the city at night and during the day were both quite impressive. I had room service a number of times during the stay and while the food was alright in my opinion, my relatives didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem impressed and they had been staying here a few times over the years prior to this stay. They commented that the food quality and presentation had declined from previously impressive standards. Once, they were quite late with an evening order so they made it complimentary, which was nice but we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d ordered room service a few times up to that point. We also tried the high-tea once and again, there seemed to be some issues just keeping it from being a top-quality experience. The furniture was quite worn and the setting wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really that classy. Service was ok, as with other parts of the hotel. The service was always merely just ok. Once, I asked the concierge desk about whether there was any internet available free-of-charge and they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem too welcoming in first receiving any questions and then with the question itself, which is not really how a five-star property should operate. My mother wanted to book a stay here and the reservation desk wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t that helpful in answering questions and when she called back to confirm the stay, nobody answered in spite of 3 calls, where there was plenty of time given to pick up the phone. She ended up staying at the Four Seasons in Sydney, where the service at reservations and at the hotel was much better, but the rooms there were very small. I did try the breakfast here, the quality and range were ok but again, the price demanded a little more. The location of the hotel is a relative strong point. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s close to the Rocks area and also to the Harbour. I walked to Darling Harbour without any problems. Overall, this hotel is likely to be quite good by Sydney standards and its relatively high ranking on Tripadvisor is perhaps justified but the hospitality and room standards in Australia for the five-star properties are quite some way behind those in Asia while costing more and that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a view professed by quite a few Australians on travel websites. Taking that into account, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s difficult to give a precise opinion on this property but for a five-star in Sydney, it likely makes the grade, although it did appear to be slipping a little in some areas.

The room itself (city view) and the bathroom are only 3 star quality, and at $329/night, grossly overpriced. Seating consisted of a comfortable desk chair, and a very uncomfortable chaise lounge and window box seat. The shower was over an old bath tub, with very poor water pressure. The basin's hot water tap leaked. Breakfast, at $45 per person, was woeful. There was no-one to cook eggs to order. Bain marie food included poached (cold) and scrambled (watery) eggs, tough mushrooms and tasteless bacon. The tomato juice was watered down (or of a very inferior quality), the coffee was undrinkable, and the wait staff were surly. A much better choice for breakfast is the Museum of Sydney, diagonally across from the Intercontinental main entrance - great food and coffee at reasonable prices.

The views of the iconic Opera House, Harbour Bridge the coves & Darling Harbour are the icing on the cake and entirely WORTH IT. Be sure to opt for a room permitting you access to the rooftop (Exec. club level), ESPECIALLY FOR NEW YEAR'S EVE. The Aussies put the rest of the world to shame when they celebrate NYE with their fireworks! Alternatively, if you don't have that luxury, you have an excellent view of both from the pool level and the hotel itself is located just steps from the Opera House, Circular Quay, the Rocks, etc. One of my favorite parts of Sydney is the Royal Botanical Gardens, which are RIGHT ACROSS THE STREET. It is beautiful in there, relaxing and great to bring the paper or a book, or go for a run through the paths. Btw, look for bats -- even during the day (no joke). If you like to shop, exit the hotel on Macquarie St. and make a right to head to the Queen Victoria Building, or QVB, the shops in/around Martin Plaza & lining George Street (high-end). Along the way, you'll see several really great museums. General impression of hotel staff and accommodation: Overall, they were polite...no particular complaint, but the staff just weren't as enthusiastic to help or show me their city as I've experienced when visiting other hotels***. I was unpleasantly surprised to find that my 15\" laptop could not fit in my in-room safe or that the staff downstairs did not have a safety deposit box large enough for my laptop and refused to take it (a 5-star hotel should certainly be able to handle a request like that)***In-room internet fees are much too high. The hotel is tastefully decorated. The facade, to me, somehow reminds us of Australian roots in mining. The entrance lobby/first floor has a nice, sleek design. Security is a priority with key cards being required for elevator operation. There were several features to my rooms that I was happy the hotel utilized: speakers (linked to TV system) in bathroom to listen to the news while getting ready in the morning; part of the bathroom console opened to the room, which allowed a lot of natural light; a lot of magazines, books were stocked in the room, and I found them very informative; and, finally, I was happy with the electric-powered blackout shades.", "Date": "December 8, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bangalore", "Title": "\u201cLovely location but expensive\u201d", "Author": "Subrus", "ReviewID": "UR89048908", "Content": "This is bang on Sydney Harbour, with great views of the bridge and Opera House.

Faultless service, treated as a guest not as a commodity, where 'How can I help you Mr........?' means exactly that. Housed within the Old Treasury building, the hotel is low key and quietly understated in external appearance, but once inside, the best kept secret in Sydney reveals itself immediately. The rooms are all beautifully maintained and are immaculate in every way upon arrival. We prefer the slightly more expensive Watsons Bay rooms, (as we are there primarily to begin or end a cruise), but have also been fortunate enough to have been given the full sydney harbour view rooms including the Opera House too. The location is second to none, just 2 minutes down to eclectic Circular Quay with its ferries, trains, buses and waterside restaurants and cafes, and only another minute further to the Opera House complex itself. The Sydney Waterfront and the 'Rocks' area are no more than a 10 minute stroll away. Alternatively, Horseshoe Bay, The Botanical gardens and the Music Conservatoire are just across the road, if looking for some quieter recreation.

I had checked into the hotel with my friend first cause she wanted to see the hotel room cause we had spent the day in the city together and I had to wait for my partner. Upon arrival I was welcomed with a smiling faces from the concierge and bell person, which felt really nice. As I made my way to front desk to check in at 2pm (even though check in is 3pm) There was a bride making her way out to the car,kids were running around the bride and family following the bride laughing and having a good time, this gave me an instant feel of warmth and happiness. When I checked in front desk staff congratulated me on my anniversary and gave me a warm welcome.. When I entered the room, the room was spotless, the view was absolutely amazing. i was on level 25 we were in room 2509. The room felt so cozy and intimate but the best bit was the window seats. I had arrive with my friend first and still waiting for my partner, So we decided to go get something to eat, we came back around 4.30pm and to my surprise my friend notice a bottle of wine, 2 wine glasses and lil envelope and box of some sort. I opened it up. It was a box of Guylian chocolate and the envelope said congratulations. Which I thought was really sweet and thoughtful. Also after me and my partner came back from dinner we notice that they did a turnover service and chocolate on the side of bed. At around about 3am when we came back from enjoying a friends bday in the city nightlife we decided we needed a late check out. I called the Instant guest service and a pleasant staff member by the name of Dereck I think organized a late check out for us for 2pm. He was very pleasant and didnt sound dead or annoyed at 3am in the morning. We were very impress by that. Now to the bed, we had a great sleep, the bed was very soft and comfortable and the pillows were really really soft and fluffy. When we woke up we didnt want to leave because of the view so we decided to just sit and enjoy the view one last time. When we checked out, check out was quick, smooth and efficient. Overall this experience was fantastic....I can honestly say I really cant fault it.....I really regret not being able to fill out the feedback form even though I was meaning to do it but I just forgot.. I would definitely stay here again and recommen it to another. Even my partner who is very picky about customer service was very impress and could not say one bad thing about it.

This is one of life's great experiences at not much more than a normal hotel price.

The main problem we had with this hotel was on our second night we wanted to ask concierge for a restaurant recommend but they were busy. We then asked the reception supervisor for a restaurant for a family - it was my 7year old daughters birthday. This person directed as to a restaurant in Kings Cross. Being from another country we were unaware this is actually a red light district with xrated \"bars\"!!!!!!!

The rooms, housekeeping, facilities, restaurants and concierge services were all of the high standard we expect from Intercontinental. The staff were all very helpful and friendly. All in all, such a good experience that we changed our plans to return to this hotel for another few days at the end of our holiday so we could soak up a bit more of Sydney before departure. Its location is perfect for sightseeing and we found we did not need a car at all - everything can easily be reached by ferry or on foot or taxi if you are in a hurry.

We highly recommend the FJ Tours for the day trip to the Blue Mountains as they only had 6 people sign up for the tour that day and they didn't cancel it like some other tour companies apparantly do per the Sydney Tourist Office. The $145 cost was very reasonable which included a delicious 3 course lunch at a country club, price for the railroad and skyway rides and entrance to Featherdale Park.

Going in, I had an expectation that The Intercontinental would offer world class service, comfortable rooms and an amazing view. As I reflect upon our stay there there are a couple of things that did not live up to my expectations -- particularly given the price we were paying for a 3 night stay. Upon arrival the lobby was filled with folks checking out, one of my first impressions was waiting in line for a front desk person to check me in. The woman I was in line to see looked up at me and asked that I go to another front desk person across the way. As I headed there another pushy guest ran there to beat me. The second front desk person took care of her instead of me, forcing me back to my old place in line. Once I got up to the first front desk person she asked me to hold on for a moment while she firmly told the guy behind me to not wait in her line. She was trying to encourage guests to wait for the next available front desk person instead of for a specific person....this only confused the guy behind me and left me thinking, \"if you want people to queue differently get a queue line! Don't try to manage the crowd by yelling behind a desk!\". Very Strange for an alleged World Class hotel. I was thankful that we were able to check in to our room early -- this was a very special treat that offset this earlier confusion. The next surprise to me was the room itself. We splurged on a room with a view of the Sydney harbor and were thrilled with the window and window bench, however, I was shocked at how small the rooms were. The bathrooms are tiny and overall these rooms are not spacious. It put me in mind of a cabin on a cruise ship. Again, given the price point this was a bit annoying. The third surprise to me was how the lobby bar closed up early (around 10:00 pm on a weekday) but even more surprising was catching the bartender as he had Just Closed the place and asking for a couple of beers and having him tell me No, we're closed (it was minutes after he had closed out the register) even at a mid range hotel I would expect the bartender to hand us the two beverages and write down on a piece of paper that room XXX need sto be charged for 2 beers and to remind the opening guy to ring it up with tomorrow's business. Another morning we decided to have room service, the directory said to choose a number on the phone to get to room service. We dialed and it ringed without anyone answering for 10-15 minutes. I eventually called their Golden Service area (concierge) to find out how to connect and they hunted down the room service attendant to take my order. It left me wondering ....is this brand's target market is the business traveler who may have a higher tolerance for lower service levels since they are not paying for it out of their pocket?

Check-in was speedy and efficient and the room was very comfortable with lovely bed and linen, when we flicked the bedside switch to open the window blinds in the morning the bay view was simply stunning. The club facilities ('complimentary' early evening drinks/canapes & breakfast on the 31st floor) however were only memorable due to the truly spectacular views - we were so busy in Sydney we missed the evening drinks on 4 of our nights, free Internet facilities consisted of only 2 PCs and it was difficult to find these available, Service was variable and overall we did not think that the 'club' upgrade was worth the premium price paid. When we returned at the end of our holiday with a hire car we found the reception service wonderful as they arranged the return of our car to Avis (I really wasn't looking forward to driving through the city to find the King's Cross drop off point). We had booked 'club' facilities again but at check-in we asked if we could change to room only and again service was very friendly and accomodating - we ended up with a very reasonable room rate, we had no problem with the city view and had a lovely inexpensive breakfast at the Museum cafe opposite the hotel entrance.

The first time was 5 years ago so my memory of the hotel had faded a little. On returning this month I found it to be a great place to stay with modern style and a comfortable room. The location of the hotel is, as others have noted, very handy. It's a very easy walk to circular quay station and the gardens. Depending on what part of the CBD you're visting that's walkable as well. The trip to the airport is also very quick by car, it took us only 15 minutes on Sunday afternoon. We had a standard room with a view over watsons bay and the gardens. This is a great view and as I've seen the opera house many times before I prefer this view and wouldn't pay more for the other rooms with a view. The room is compact but they have made the best possible use of the space so that it doesn't feel as cramped as its 32sq m would have you believe. The bench seat along the window is a smart idea and I enjoyed lounging here and looking out over the gardens. The decor is modern and well executed. Unfortunately we found the bed to be too soft and couldn't sleep very well on the two nights we were there. This would be our only complaint about the hotel. Room service was fast, reasonably priced and tasted great. The breakfast downstairs was average and it's not worth anything near the $38 they charge. For us it was only $10 more per night to have it included in the room rate and at that price it's good value. There was a reasonable range of hot and cold food but the service was limited.

We checked in and the counter staff were young, but they got the job done and we went up to our room which was really very lovely, big panoramic window with lush furnishings and LCD tv - kinda what you expect at this price range - but the bathroom, although clean and well appointed - is looking a bit dated and a shower curtain at this level of accomodation is a bit iffy. Very nice otherwise. Didn't have enough time to really explore the features of the hotel but we did have a cocktail or two down in the bar which was nice and funky but quite pricey.

Location did not disappoint, but the Intercontinental reputation took a hit during this trip. - No airport transfer is offered (Shangri-La does have this service). - Check-in experience: I called the hotel in advance to let them know that we would be arriving in Sydney very early in the morning and would appreciate an early check in if possible. They couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t accommodate us, but I didn't expect them to since it was the start of the high season. I was surprised though, that I had to ask the concierge to let my friend and I use their showering facilities upstairs. (It was 7am and we couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get into our room until 2pm.) We had just traveled halfway around the world and hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seen a shower in nearly 24 hours \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t care if you had only traveled 10 miles and were checking in \u00e2\u20ac\u201c you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re a five star hotel! Isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t customer satisfaction top of mind? By the way, at 2pm, the maid was still in the room. - Rooms: If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re getting a double, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect a great view. These rooms are limited to the lower floors. We paid extra for a bridge view room but couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see much thanks to our place on the 10th floor. The rooms are also quite small, especially the bathroom, where the tub, tile, and sink are incredibly dated and there is hardly any counter space. No flat screen TV, either. (If you read the below reviews, the management states that they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll eventually remodel the rooms and have flat screens in every room.) Also strange was the lack of sheets on the bed \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just a light duvet\u00e2\u20ac\u201cand how often do they really clean those? The 2 redeeming qualities about the room: the nice bench by the window and the automated shutters. - Big EWWW experience: I was sitting by the window one evening when I heard a distinct buzzing sound. I turned on the desk lamp and sure enough, a rather sizeable roach was crawling all over our room. Thankfully my friend was deep asleep; otherwise she would\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen a giant, dirty bug crawling on top of her head. I was forced to defend her with a magazine until said bug crawled into the ventilation shaft. I stayed awake for an hour before figuring it wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be returning. Next morning, I explain this to the concierge and request a thorough clean up, only to receive a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Oh, so sorry, yes we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll clean things up right away.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd We return to the hotel later in the afternoon to find no special attention was given; in fact the bathroom was short some towels and we were left with a tall stack of linens and pillowcases on our desk. Really?! No comp drink tickets, no bottle of wine, no apology note from management? How much does a note cost you? A large, stinking cockroach was in our $325+/night hotel room, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going to act like nothing happened? Dear management: please thank my friend for being coy and not letting me create a scene in your hotel lobby, and for not letting me post the several photos I took of the roach crawling around on the ceiling for size comparison. She\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s saved you some embarrassment, though I doubt this review will help you any, either. - Vibe: Hardly any. Despite it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s location, the lobby bar downstairs was far from exciting. The upstairs bar wasn't hopping, either. Patrons are mostly business folk. While not a bad thing, not a great place to mingle, either. - Staff: Billy at check out was our only stand out staff member. The others were cordial enough, but a young blonde lady could\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve used some lessons in humility. Pros: Hotel is in a good location if you want to go to the Opera House and Botanical Gardens every day. (Note that the Shangri-La really isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t that far on the other side of the Quay \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Sydney is deceptively small\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6) Rooms are decent and for the most part, comfortable. The AMP tower has a very convenient and cheap food court next door \u00e2\u20ac\u201c great for brekkie. Cons: Hotel is dated and smaller than expected. Bottom line: If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going to pay a 5-star price, check in to the Shangri-La, because you can do better, and they will do better by you. Please note that I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m being hard on this hotel because it is an Intercontinental brand, is ranked as 5 star, and is in one of the greatest and most visited cities in the world.

Sadly caught between hotel and travel agent we have no one accepting the blame which if we had known the shambles we were going to would have booked elsewhere its not like th only hotel in Sydney! Having stayed in Cairns, Noosa then Sydney with this being by far the most expensive it was by far the worst for simply not delivering what we belived we had booked. Starting point was on check in where as a company of two families each requiring two rooms and specifically requesting adjoining rooms to allow our children to be next door we were firstly met with rooms not being ready at 3 in the afternoon, then being informed that adjoining rooms were request only and that they were VERY busy we ended up with 7 floors between parents and children! Wec then had the fiasco of being given a smoking room which to non smokers is nothing short of vile! Simple requests of he staff therafter simply became ridiculous with room changing between the wrong rooms, fumigation of the smoking room multiple times, no access to the rooftop lounge which only after complaining were we grudginlgy afforded limited entry. Piece de resistance yes you've guessed no access to rooftop for the firworks the whole point in booking this hotel and trust me we checked on numerous occassions that we had this access. The staff in reception were less than helpful, very pretty but less than helpful and certainly not what you would expect from a top class hotel. VERY VERYdisappointed in this hotel wouldn't recommend it to anyone, I wouldn't expect to have to carry e-mail evidence as proof to any hotel and have never had to before - to be honest I felt less like a guest much more of an irritation to busy people! Our NY firworks were saved by joining my nephew on the rooftop of his very small hotel in Kirribilli where the owner was delighted to welcome us to a wonderful evening of buffet, champagne and fantastic never forgotten fireworks show.

Our luggage was accidentally delivered to my brother's room - an easy mistake to make in a hotel with several rooms booked in the same surname - and the last time all weekend that anything went wrong - from that point, everything was perfect. The State Suite is stunning - 150 square metres, a huge bedroom, a huge bathroom, office area, guest bathroom, dressing room, lounge area, dining area and (slightly gratuitously) a grand piano. The views from the room are breathtaking, even for a jaded Sydney resident who looks at the Opera House every day at work. Room service was punctual, the food very good. Every single staff member was friendly, happy and polite, and could not have been more helpful. The bed was comfortable, the shower a joy. The rooms were spotlessly clean, and cleaned promptly. Checkout was easy. Etch - the restaurant associated with the hotel - is perfect, and ran the perfect wedding reception, that has our friends and family still talking. This was a magnificent stay - a perfect weekend in a perfect room with perfect service.

In a full hotel, this meant that they were unable to offer us the guaranteed room upgrade - one of our key reasons for choosing this hotel against other chains. However, after a little gentle persistence, in lieu of the room upgrade we were offered use of the Club facilities, which for us was actually nicer. The room was plush and comfortable and although initially we were disappointed to have a view of an office block a few metres away, this was more than made up for by the view from the Club. We took breakfast there - definitely a cut above the usual Club Lounge fare - and were very well looked-after. One afternoon we popped in for afternoon tea while we took a break from seeing the sights and a couple of evenings we tried the cocktails and canapes, again, a very pleasant experience. If there is a downside, it is the cost of parking but then that's true of Sydney as a whole. We decided that whilst in the city, a car was actually a hindrance because of the cost to park so we collected it after we checked out and headed off for the rest of our break. After the initial confused start, we had a delightful stay.

We paid $330 for the first night...the second night would have been $360 (weekend rate - Club Level)...but we only paid $330 for the full weekend (+US$150 which at current rates is very good value!). We have since signed up to the Priority Club (free) and the Priority Privilege Club ($289) and they've really paid for themselves.

The location of the hotel is perfect for getting around the city easily. It's two blocks from Circular Quay which offers ferries, buses, and trains. Although the hotel sits high above the quay, across the street is a building that has escalators from the top of the hill to the quay with a food court plaza halfway, so if you are tired after a big day and don't want to walk up the hill, you can take the escalators and maybe stop for coffee and a snack at the food court as well. The rooms are quiet, comfortable and spacious, with nice views. The beds are excellent and there are lots of pillows. We found the price very reasonable, maybe partly because it was winter in Sydney and they have fewer guests. We never ate in the hotel, fully expecting it to be be overpriced. There are so many restaurants to choose from close by at the quay, the Rocks, the promenade to the Opera House, and the International Passenger Terminal Building, why eat at the hotel? City Extra at the quay became our favorite breakfast spot. Their mango and coconut muffins are addictive. If I have any criticism they would be: the hot water in the shower is really hot and could be dangerous for some people with small children or health problems. Some of the desk staff seem to think working in a really nice hotel justifies a snobbish attitude.

After we booked, we read many of the reviews on here and started to get cold feet. The upshot of some of the reviews said that it was overpriced for what you get. Nothing could be further from the truth. The Intercontinental is a truly lovely hotel to be in with lots of little extras that we didn't bank on. I felt special from the moment I walked in until the moment we left. The staff were incredibly competent and friendly and did everything we asked and more. I will add that we were there for the quieter moments as well as the super busy check in/check out times so we got to see the Hotel at work under pressure and it passed with flying colours. It is an expensive hotel drinks wise, but we wanted to have a weekend in the big smoke and wanted to stay in a hotel that has everything you could want at your fingertips. The prices of the minibar, facilities, parking etc were around the mark of any other 5 star hotel with the same aspect. We got what we asked for. An additional pleasant surprise was the restaurant \"Etch\" where the silver service was impeccable and the food was amazing and very reasonably priced (cheaper than Mad Cow @ Ivy or Est. - also good spots to eat). We also took advantage of the buffet breakfast in Cafe Opera and note that one reviewer here said it was \"bland and tasteless\" and not 5 star. I don't know what frame of reference they had, but I had just stayed four nights at the Novotel Darling Harbour for a conference before upping the ante to the Intercon for the weekend and the buffet at Novotel was nothing short of atrocious. My frame of reference from many buffet breakfasts I've had at 4/5 star hotels over the years was that this was the best I've had. I would recommend that you ask for a table on the terrace rather than a table inside, because the ambience was less \"buffet\". I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone who wants a good nights sleep with a beautiful view to wake up to (we were in room #2006 and had a Watsons Bay view room), and who appreciates the value of being surrounded by culture and history. The shower was fantastic and HOT and the aircon was efficient too. Some complained about the traffic noise but we had no problem even though we were higher up above the Cahill expressway/EDT where you'd expect the noise to travel and be louder.

I'm very glad I made the choice I did. The Four Season & Shangri-la required 2-room since we were traveling w/out 10yr old and 13 year old. The westin, Marriott and Intercontinental allowed the 4 of us in one room. We reserved a Watson View Room because it overlooked the Royal Botanical Gardens and as I'd hoped, I didn't feel like we were in a tall building 'stuffed' between other tall buildings in a big city. Our view was incredibly beautiful. The room was clean and good size but not large. The decor was nice and the furnishings were very practical. There was a lot of space for luggage - even though the closet was just average sized. The bathroom was very clean. The beds, pillows were soft and comfortable. The turndown service came every night at 8 with bottles of water and some chocolates. The pool on the top floor was small, heavily chlorinated and simple. The kids enjoyed it anyway - and I really enjoyed the views! Wished they had some drink and/or snack service up there though. We were there in late-winter during uncommonly warm weather for the time. It was in the 70's and very comfortable. I could see if it were cold, or rainy, this would definitly be the place to stay so you wouldn't need to bother with getting around - the Intercontinental is perfectly situated for ease of getting to any tourist attraction. We were a 5-minute walk to the Opera House, and to the Quay where you get onto the Ferry's for the zoo and other tours. The Royal Botanical Gardens were literally across the street and we visited daily so our kids could fly their boomerangs. We were a 10-minute stroll to the Rocks which has trendy shops and nice bistro style restaurants. The Hyatt which is also well rated is located in the Rocks - and I think our location was equally as good, maybe better considering the Hyatt sits directly beneath the Harbor Bridge. Everything is closer than it appears to be on the maps. We didn't get the hop-on-hop-off pass because it was easier to take a harbor tour, then just walk everywhere. Once we did take a cab to the Pit Street shopping areas - but we walked back afterwards. The staff was polite in a somewhat business-like manner. They seem to cater more to business travelers than to vacationers although there were a lot of vacationers at the hotel. We didn't really need much from them, so it didn't matter. When we did need something - they were effecient. The restaurant staff was very good and attentive. 2 mornings we had breakfast across the street at the Sydney Museum. Simple menu, about the same price as the hotel, but the breakfast was very good. It was recommended by the hotel reception desk. A waiter there told us a story of when former President George W Bush had recently stayed at the Intercontinental. He said all the streets were shut down and security was everywhere. Well, if its good enough for George, its good enough for us. Bet he had an Opera House view room. Please note that if you do stay here, there's ample opportunity of opera house viewing, to the point of opera-house 'overkill' if there could be such a thing. In a city with so many options, it may be hard to go wrong.

The check-in process went well considering they had only an hour to process our booking and all staff very friendly and helpful. Loved the window seat concept - unfortunately the seat itself was very uncomfortable. Otherwise very standard looking room with average but clean and adequately stocked bathroom for this star rated hotel. There was no pressure in the shower head - two options either a cold \"shower\" like standing under a garden hose or boiling hot. Breakfast was very disappointing - not much choice given it is meant to be a full buffet breakfast in a five star hotel. It was a bland looking arrangement of food with no colour and what was there was not very tasty. The hotel location is terrific and the staff all very nice and helpful, but the room itself is not very atmospheric. The bar in the Atrium is lovely though. Parking, check-out all worked well. I agree with another poster that the driveway is difficult to locate and is actually best approached by driving down Macquarie St towards the Opera House, then left into Albert St and left again into Phillip St. That way you can turn left into the driveway of the hotel. Internet is via a broadband cable (no wi-fi available) and was $15AUD per hour or $25AUD per day. I realise the daily rate is probably fairly standard in Australia but the hourly rate is certainly a deterrant if you just want to quickly check emails or check something on the web. When we questioned alternatives we were not offered 30 minutes free of charge or any other options. If the shower had worked and the breakfast was better then this rate would have been good value for money.

As a one-off customer, we were certainly not provided any special treatment. We will definitely not return.

En route we had stayed at the Intercontinental Singapore and had a wonderful stay, sadly the hotel in Sydney left us both feeling underwhelmed. On arrival at check-in the receptionist was engrossed in what must have been some important paperwork as our arrival wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even acknowledged until the final staple had been applied. Comparisons with Singapore couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be avoided. However, he eventually noticed that someone was trying to check-in and greeted us with an adequate welcome. As a Platinum Ambassador member I reserved a standard room on points, but on check-in asked if I could pay for an upgrade to a Club Room. This was possible at a charge of AU$150 but this was balanced with a no Ambassador room upgrade, as I had paid on points and this was the Intercontinental Sydney! Our room was a typically well appointed Intercontinental room with a city view ( as reserved) but there was no water or fruit in the room and despite advising at reservation stage that it was our anniversary no acknowledgement of any kind\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6..again comparisons with Singapore crept back. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve recently stayed at various Intercontinental hotels as part of trips to celebrate either my wife\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s birthday or an anniversary, each one (London, Paris, Singapore) has recognised the occasion and made a gesture which is very much appreciated. Sydney however, is different and whilst I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect something for nothing there should at least be some consistency. At Singapore the receptionist wishing my wife a happy anniversary was thoughtful and enough. As usual, we took a wander around the hotel to check out the facilities and found a fabulously well appointed hotel. The swimming pool is indoors and has the view of the harbour but the best of all is the Club lounge, the view of the harbour, including the bridge and Opera House is amazing, especially at night. Sadly, our time was limited and we weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really able to enjoy the lounge and its magnificent vista. The hotel is located very close to Circular Quay, so picture postcard Sydney is right on your doorstep making it a great place to be. The Botanical gardens are just across the road, and the Opera House is literally only a few hundred yards away. Breakfast was in the Club lounge, service was courteous and the selection was broad and plentiful. We have no complaints at all and again enjoyed a wonderful view over the harbour, but there was something lacking. The hotel facilities are as expected from an Intercontinental, the location is exceptional but we left still feeling underwhelmed. Service from sister Intercontinental hotels left this one in the shade despite its fabulous location, and if I stay in Sydney again I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll probably pitch for one of the Holiday Inns or maybe the Crowne Plaza at Coogee.

Valet parking was smooth although the driveway was a bit tight and had a number of cars parked along it.

The view was a promised - out over Watson's Bay to the heads, but also overlooking the expressway. The shower curtain had some odd red stain on the inside (looked like shower gel?) The tiles were chipped and cracked and the water pressure was abysmal. The shower gel and shampoo smelled quite strong and ended up overpowering the perfume I put on later.

We stayed at the Intercontinental for four nights. We've been to Sydney several times (though before we had our son) and we've traveled a fair amount since having him, so we had strong priors about what we wanted in a hotel. We were tremendously pleased with our experience at the Intercontinental and will certainly stay there again when we're back in Sydney. Many reviews say that the location is great. This is especially so for a toddler. - First, the entrance to Royal Botanical Gardens is just one block and one street crossing away. The Gardens offer a myriad of delights for toddlers - the water fountains, the red tram, the pools, the sprinklers, all the different types of birds, the cafe for snacks. Our son just ran and ran in the Gardens each of our three visits there. Loved it tremendously. - Second, on the far side of the Garden is the Andrew (Boy) Charleton pool. This is a public lap pool with a really nice separate toddler pool (and a small infant splash area). It is a modern and beautifully designed facility (with a nice cafe upstairs). No towels for rent - so make sure to bring your own. - Third, Circular Quay is about 100 yards away, which offers buskers - live music, juggling, other cool stuff to enthrall kids - and more importantly... ferries! Riding the ferries could be a half day activity by itself. They of course go to great places for toddlers like Manly and the Sydney Aquarium (hint: buy your aquarium tickets from/at the ferry, which allows you to bypass the tremendously long ticket line at the aquarium itself). Dining options were also toddler compatible. - For breakfast, we opted for the breakfast buffet at the Opera Cafe. There is a hot item station, cold item station (smoked fish, meats, fruit, bircher muesli, etc.), asian options (miso soup, porridge, pickled vegetables, etc.), a pastry station. We ate five breakfasts - tried every option - all pretty nice quality (we lived in NYC-greenwich village for five years... so like to think we know something about food quality). With a toddler, the fact that there are many choices and the food is already prepared helps make for a nice meal for everyone. - For a light dinner/drinks, the Cortile was just right. We could order wine and light bites. Since the Cortile is essentially the atrium/lobby the large volume and space between tables/seating areas makes it toddler/kid friendly. On the menu, our son liked the three mini burgers. - There is of course also room service, which we found pretty solid - but not a tremendously diverse menu. We also ate at a few restaurants near the hotel and at Circular Quay. We found the service people we interacted with pleasant and professional. While this is certainly their job, they seemed actually pretty interested in assisting us and making us comfortable. Upon check out, the bell man suggested we take the hotel car back to the airport instead of a cab for a flat fee less than a cab and in a car more comfortable than a cab. A nice touch to an excellent stay. Our toddler son kept asking throughout the rest of the trip, especially when we got to a new place and checked into another hotel, \"Go back to Intercontinental?\".

We average three to four days per week traveling extensively across Asia for our respective investment firms. We also travel at times in the region for leisure. I provide this context because I want to be fair: the Sydney Intercontinental is an excellent hotel by most standards. However, the service is simply not comparable to other five star hotels (or other hotels at that price point), including others in Sydney (see, for instance, the Park Hyatt, Four Seasons, and especially the Shangri-La, at all of which we have stayed). We just wrapped up a five-night stay as a regular (that is, not a Club International) guest. The problems that we had with the service are summarized as follows: (i) not one offer of help with baggage from the point of getting out of the taxi to getting up to the room, (ii) incorrect directions provided on one occasion, (iii) had to follow up with three separate calls to retrieve clothes sent to the laundry for express pressing, (iv) no room service menu provided in the room (when called for room service, operator first responded by attempting to recite the menu, which we learned later is 10 pages long, not including the wine list), (v) soap not replaced in the shower by housekeeping, (vi) \"instant service\" call button is less than \"instant\" (only once was the call button answered within 20 rings), and (vii) empty bottle of wine left by a reveler in the elevator (discovered by the writer at 6:30am on the second night of my stay). While none of these service issues threatened the enjoyment of our stay in Sydney, the staff is clearly not as well trained as one would expect, given the price. I would refer the general manager of the Sydney Intercontinental to any similarly priced hotel in Hong Kong (e.g., Intercontinental, Mandarin Oriental, etc.), and he or she would recognize the service difference even before stepping into the lobby -- and even more so once he or she stays one night. The fact that George W. Bush stayed at the Sydney Intercontinental is less a testament to the service quality of the hotel and more an indictment of the standards to which he must have grown accustomed. To end on a positive note, one major plus for me (perhaps less so for other travelers) is that the gym is one of the more intelligently equipped that I have encountered. Notably, there is a pull up bar, high ceilings, and airy views. Just buyer beware: make sure you understand for what you are paying a premium.

The reception and restaurant staff have been transformed from the uninterested and fairly lazy attitude of 3 years ago - I was out of my car, booked in an in my room in about 7 minutes, served by staff who looked me in the eye, smiled and were extremely pleasant - just what you need after a 4 hour drive. The room was very comfortable, well equiped and could not fault it. Dinner in the restaurant saw excellent food and service, as was breakfast. On checking out after 2 nights the young man at reception was careful to explain all items on the bill and my car was waiting for me outside. What more can be asked for? The main difference between this hotel and the Amora where I have stayed probably about 30 times now is simply the staff attitude - at the Amora they are efficient but cold and impersonal apart from the concierge and his staff - sometimes at the Amora Reception I think if I turned up disguised as Osama Bin Laden they wouldn't notice as they are perfunctory in their duties and never look you in the eye - so well done to the management at the Intercontinental who are delivering an excellent product.", "Date": "September 11, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cBad food, mediocre service - not 5 star hotel\u201d", "Author": "aantonop", "ReviewID": "UR19979133", "Content": "I stayed at this hotel with my wife, while on a business trip Rooms are small, some views are great and the location is very good. But the food and overall service were not up to the standards of a 5 star hotel. We ordered room service on our last night. The appetizers were of average quality, not much better than would be expected at a 3 star hotel restaurant. Both the main courses were inedible. One main course was a risotto with scallops. Pretty much everything was wrong. Bland, dry and sticky rice, rubbery overcooked scallops. The second main course was pork sausages with mashed potatoes. The sausages were so overcooked they were hard, dry and chewy. Both courses should not have even left the kitchen. Any half-decent chef will have quality control and taste the meals or at least inspect them visually before sending them out. I could tell just by looking at them that they were bad, and I'm no pro. Disgraceful. When we complained about this, the room service supervisor apologized profusely and told us they would comp the meal. They refunded about 75% of the price *only* of the main courses, not the whole meal. Not only did we end up paying part of the main courses that were not touched (one bite then returned), but we paid service charges, tray charge, and tax on them too. We ended up paying more than $100 for 2 appetizers. It's a great location, but this hotel does not deserve 5 stars. I've stayed at plenty of 5-star hotels and the quality of service is impeccable.

Research on the web when it comes to booking the right hotel really does no justice - it's not until when you finally arrive in Sydney that you realize what part of town you should have stayed in and what hotel you should have really booked. We decided to book a hotel near the Syndey Harbour Bridge and The Sydney Opera because those were the main attractions that we wanted to visit, however this was a costly decision. When trying to book the right hotel, they were all booked (2 months in advance). We originally tried to book the Sydney Harbour Marriott but they were all booked (the property is beautiful but pricey) so we decided to go for the next big thing in name - The Intercontinental Hotel, the reviews were pretty good at Trip Advisor so we figured, hey at least we wont be staying in a dump or worried that we chose a crappy hotel. The property is literally in the business district of Sydney (lots of business people inside the hotel), however, you can walk (about 5-6 long block walk to the Sydney Harbour). That is the environment all day and night long at this hotel and it's surroundings, seems to be a lot of companies nearby. This was not a good thing at night to eat, as we had to cab it to the Darling Harbour or walk to the actual Sydney Harbour for real sightseeing and eating. The hotel was great, however it is overpriced for tourists because it mainly attracts business people. I paid $1380 US dollars for 4 days/3 nights just for the room. There was complementary breakfast and it was good. Your normal buffet style breakfast. The hotel is beautiful and upscale - but again, it's not meant for tourist although it's near a tourist location. If i had to go back to Sydney again - i would stay at the Darling Harbour, it was more of a younger happening environment, more hotels, more deals, definitely the happening side of town. Us not knowing booked the Sydney Harbour side thinking that was the happening place to be - well guys, its really not, yes it full and packed with tourists because you can do your harbour cruises there, the Opera House and the Sydney Bridge, however, you can just cab it there for 1 or 2 days from the Darling Harbour. But that is my personal preference. Also, we were able to see some cool hotels which were not advertised as popularly or not known as much - for example if you are staying in the Sydney/Opera House area, i would recommend checking out the The Sebel Pier One Sydney or the Quay Grand Suites - i would definitely stay and book in one of these if i were to go back to Sydney. These hotels are in the middle of the action, and people just dont know abou them and you'll be saving half of the money. If you are staying in the Darling Harbour area (which i would stay in if i were to go back) i would stay at the Grand Mercure Darling Harbour. We walked by these hotels and we were thinking, if we only knew about these awesome properties!! We would have saved half of the money and more on tours!! Overall the Intercontinental is a gorgeous hotel, no complaints at all, it's definitely luxury, but again you are paying to stay in a business class hotel - i would definitely check out the other hotels we saw while in Sydney and stay in the middle of the action and more of a tourist feel vs. staying in a business environment hotel. I would definitely go back to this hotel if they were to offer me more of a deal, its just very expensive to stay there.", "Date": "January 8, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kailua, Hawaii", "Title": "\u201cSterile but convenient\u201d", "Author": "hawaiichick", "ReviewID": "UR12156748", "Content": "This is much better suited to business travel than leisure.

We were told service was going to be $85 but when we arrived we were told, without apology, that it would be $145 instead, and they didn't know why they hadn't contacted us to notify us of the change. Needless to say I was not impressed and didn't want to avail of the service so stayed in that night. Hotel room was comfortable, great set up for a business hotel with nice desk area in the bedroom. Bathroom was pretty basic for a 5 star and nothing too luxurious in there. Pool area is pretty small but views are great. It could have been kept cleaner and mopped up a bit.

Firstly: Priority Club Membership \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcBenefits\u00e2\u20ac\u2122: Upon check in, my platinum status and the fact it was the first stop on our honeymoon, was not recognised at all. (Incidentally why does nobody ever seem to man the Priority Club check in areas?) Thankfully we checked in early around 11AM, but when I asked what benefits I could hope to expect during my stay I received the abrupt reply that the hotel was full and there would be no upgrades available. When I asked about access to the club lounge a ludicrous figure of AUD400 per night was quoted and that it was a private club during most of the day? This did not make sense as I have used hotel lounges around the world with no such problems. As it was a 3 night stay, I asked if there would be any change the following nights and I was advised to ask again. When I subsequently asked about platinum benefits on the second night, I received the same answer as the first night that the hotel was full. This is the most irritating point is that I believe we were lied to about the later 2 nights as I had previously checked availability for these nights, outside of the hotel and discovered that the full range of rooms to be available. Of course I pointed out I had just checked this but received the same incorrect answer. Needless we were not impressed by the level of service we received from an Intercontinental Hotel. As I am also a Hilton gold card member it was a tough decision between the Sydney Hilton and Intercontinental hotels. We decided on this hotel for the supposed great views. We won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make the same mistake twice! The Hotel Itself: This seems to be a very cold business hotel. As mentioned before, there was a conference on and the hotel had no atmosphere. The lobby area is small and not very inspiring and the cortile lounge bar was closed and boarded up due to construction works. The \u00e2\u20ac\u0153city view\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd room was OK, but lacked any wow factor. We were on the 17th floor with indeed a view of the city block next to the hotel. The room had been recently redecorated, but seemingly not the bathroom which did not have a separate bath and shower, just the usual over bath shower. There was also a strange window between the bedroom and the bathroom \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we thought you could maybe watch TV from the toilet?! The room was pleasant and clean enough, but for the price you are paying you expect a bit more! Yes, all rooms have the window ledge seat which appears to be a main selling point? Also, as far as I could ascertain all of the different \u00e2\u20ac\u0153view\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd rooms are the same size, just with the different views. There was no phone book to be seen in the room (maybe I missed it somewhere) and only a pencil, not a pen, in a supposed five star hotel room? It must be cutbacks? The cord for the iron was frayed and looked dangerous \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we pointed this out on check out and hope they would have changed it by now. The room really needs the 2 doors with a small hallway to cut out the inevitable door banging which always goes on in hotels. The Fitness Centre: Very small indoor (why in Sydney??) swimming pool. If you had more than 4 swimmers it was full. Pool was approx 10 metres in length. For some reason the female changing was poolside and the male changing outside of the pool room, near the gym. In the changing rooms, the sauna was good, but no steam room. Gym was small with the usual selection of machines. Location: Very good location for Circular quay, Opera House and botanical gardens. If you want the main tourist areas, stick to Darling Harbour. Overall this hotel is no better than a Holiday Inn, and for the price you pay \u00e2\u20ac\u201c AUD277 or GBP122 per night as a base price \u00e2\u20ac\u201c very expensive indeed.

Stayed here for 5 nights. The worst experience I have ever had with IC hotel. Three hours after check in time and after 5 calls later, finally the manager himself brought a complimentary basket of fruit and two bottle of waters. This service should not have been asked repeatedly for Ambassador members upon check in. The Concierge (Zafar) was very rude. He was on a personal phone call and did not want to finish his call so he gave me only 1 small brochure (like a pamphlet) for the city tour. I had to ask for more brochure to go to other places (the brochures are all in the cabinet/closet behind his station). He told me to just read them and did not suggest which tour I should take. Then, he went back to continue with his phone call. I went back to the lobby and spoke with his manager (David) who did not handle this matter professionally. I refused to speak with this rude concierge therefore, David (the manager who is not familiar with any tour offered) had to ask the concierge and then related the message to me. He tried not to laugh at first because for some \"ODD\" reason he found it amusing to explain what the concierge had told him to me. Very unprofessional. Had buffet breakfast, there were not many selection (I gave a 1 in a scale of 1 to 5 compares to a buffet breakfast in Langham Melbourne hotel, we stayed there for 5 nights prior to ths hotel) to begin with but the service was no service at all. Dirty plates were left piling up in our table. We finally had to move them to a table that had piles of dirty plates too (the customers had left). Very unacceptable for a hotel that claims to be a 5 star hotel. The business center has only 1 computer to use if you need to go online and does not bring your lap top. The hotel charges AS$18 per hour. What a joke! Good thing it was Saturday night when I had to use a computer therefore, I did not need to wait to use the computer. Next, I asked another rude concierge (I did not get his name) who misinformed me about catching my flight home. I have a connecting domestic flight in Brisbane and was not sure whether I should go to international or domestic terminal at the airport. He told me that I should have gone directly to the international terminal. Relying on his words (did not doubt of his knowledge which is none), we asked to be dropped off at the international terminal. Of course! he was wrong, we had to take either a shuttle but that comes every 20 minutes to domestic terminal or a taxi. We chose a taxi of course!. Costs us another AS$20 from international to domestic terminal which is about 2 miles a part and very bad traffic. Thanks for hiring this incompetent concierge who should not be giving any advice to any guests. What a shame!. Overall, it was a very unpleasant experience down to the very last day when the reception tried to give me a weekday rate for my Sunday night stay. I was so glad I brought my confirmation from home so I could show her that she overcharged me by AS$60 for the last night of my stay. Horrible experience!!. No doubt that I will most definitely look for other hotels next time if I come to Sydney again. Marriott Sydney Harbor and Four Seasons have equally good location.

After deliberating over many different hotels, in different locations, we decided to stay at the Hotel Intercontinental, Macquarie Street Sydney. We stayed in a harbour view suite, which was just gorgeous!! Brilliant views of both the Opera House and the Harbour Bridge, it was raining, which was a shame. We opted to take out the Club Harbour View Suite, which gives access to the Club Lounge on the 31st floor. This would definitely be worth taking, if you could make use of the time from 5pm-7pm, where wine, beer and spirits were served free of charge along with canap\u00c3\u00a9s. We however, were unable to arrive until 7pm so we missed out on this, the wine after that is quite expensive at $15per glass - that's the cheapest one!! Refreshments are free, however all day - soft drink, tea, coffee. The lounge itself is gorgeous, looking over the harbour from the 31st floor, sinking into one of their lounges. There is also access outside to the balcony, which also have chairs and tables. We did make up for missing out on the free alcohol, with breakfast the next day, This is also complimentary once you have access to the Club lounge. We were expecting something quite small - continental. We were wrong!! Much to our delight, it was a full buffet, we even requested fried eggs instead of the scrambled and it was done without a problem or any extra. So the breakfast was amazing, all the favourites - juice, cereals, toast, bacon, eggs, mushrooms, yoghurt, fresh fruit, pastries - heaps. Coffee and tea was available, or request your favourite - espresso, cappuccino, hot chocolate, the list goes on, again this is all inclusive with your access to the lounge. The room was gorgeous, very large, with a day bed in the master bedroom, which you could sit and watch the world go by. The bathroom was lovely, clean, big fluffy towels, fluffy bathrobes, huge shower and deep bath. Wonderfully clean, with gorgeous flower arrangement in the bathroom. They thought of the little things as well, such as the candle and matches in the drawer, all those little things just make the difference. The bed was huge, king size plus!! Very comfortable, so were the pillows, best nights sleep I'd had in ages. The one thing we loved, was that the room had an extra blind on the windows, as well as the heavy curtains, so it was pitch black in our room at 9am - great sleep in!! We heard nothing, being so close to circular quay we expected to hear trains or sirens, but nothing at all. My only problem was.....leaving, could have spent a few days at the Intercontinental, was a truly wonderful 5* Hotel in every sense of the word. If you plan to stay and take advantage of the club lounge, be there at 5pm, you won't regret it.

On the positive side, the room was nice, the breakfasts were very good and the staff we dealt with throughout were friendly and professional. And a very nice bottle of bubbly and rose petals on our wedding night. On the negative side, on arrival in the room I found an envelope / receipt addressed to another guest, a guest survey filled in by the previous guest (interestingly, also unhappy too) and toilet paper in the lavatory. To be fair to the staff, I reported this and received a nice apology letter and bottle of bubbly. Once we got to the room on the Thursday night at about 11.30pm it was like entering a nightclub, with terribly loud music from somewhere. Again, I had to contact the duty manager to report the problem, and it was resolved by about midnight but not quite what you would expect of a 5 star hotel. Lastly, I left the flat on the Friday morning and my other half went there to get ready for the wedding (hair and make-up and so on). As such, I requested with the front desk on the Thursday night that the room be made-up at 9.15 so it was nice and presentable for the bridal party, and was told that this would occur. However nothing had been done for their arrival. I'm not quite sure really how to sum up our experience, but we had realistically high expectations which sadly the experience fell well short of.

The turndown service and complimentary newspaper are standard for all guests but it is the executive club lounge that is the attraction. The views of the Opera House, Sydney Harbour Bridge and the harbour are amazing. The buffet breakfast was complimentary, and we took a table by the windows looking out to the wonderful views of Sydney. In the afternoon there were complimentary non-alcoholic and alcoholic drinks for the cocktail hour, dinner snacks and drinks throughout the day. The swipe card was needed to access the lounge and there were stairs and also an elevator to reach the lounge level. FACILITIES There was a 24 hour gym, indoor pool, business centre and beauty salon. Room service operates 24 hours and three restaurants are available to choose from. However just outside the hotel in the immediate area are many dining and bar options in the Circular Quay area.

Ferries can be taken from Circular Quay easily round to the Darling Harbour area (easiest way to arrive), Taronga Zoo or Manly for example. Just a few stops on the train to Town Hall, is the place to start exploring shops. From here are the underground shops through to Pitt Street Mall.

Having just spent the previous 3 nights at the IC Grand Stanford in Hong Kong i'd become accustomed to something special.......and first impressions are important. This was the first 3 night stay (13-16 Feb) of our trip to Sydney....these being the first 3 nights, the next stay being the last 3 nights (22-24 Feb). The location when we arrived by taxi from the airport was just superb. 100 metres or so from Circular Quay and directly across the road from the fabulous Botanical Gardens. Our bags are collected on arrival swiftly and efficently so we headed for reception. I thought we'd just use the first one you get to when you arrive by car, which appeared to be the back door entrance instead of the main hotel reception........only to find that this WAS the main reception! Quite cold and unappealing is an understatement! We arrived at 9am so we werent expecting to be able to get into the room, but it was made available to us immediately, which was great after the overnight flight. I'd booked using my priority Club points and had been in communication with the hotel prior trying to secure good upgrades etc for my partners 40th birthday. i'd been upgraded to a Watson Bay room on the 14th floor, but not to Club as i'd hoped (It was full - Norwegian Prime Minister i think!). So, tired and ready for an early morning sleep we got to the room and opened the door. To say the first impression was that of a motel room would accurately describe how i felt. Dodgy striped carpet, formica furnishings from 1974, brown decor/bedding accessories, brown chais long and a bathroom that looked slightly out of date. If i wasnt so tired i'd have gone straight down and blown a fuse! Instead, sleep got the better of me so after a couple of hours of sleep and a shower i decided to head down and ask for a room that had recently been refurbished. \"All the rooms were refurbished 2/3 years ago sir\" was what i was told, \"based on a contemporary style by a European designer\". Surely not....no....it cant be......Lawrence Llewellyn Bowen hadnt got here before me had he?! Well not quite, but he could easily have done so. Lets just say, it takes a bit of getting used to.....and i recommend you always stay here first BEFORE going anywhere else....that way, the next place is always fantastic on first impression! On a plus note, when we got back in the evening there was a nice bottle of fizz chilling in ice and box of chocolates with a 'Happy Birthday' card on the table. A really nice touch. Staff were generally pleasant though a little off hand. A couple of the consierge team were very helpful (and also agreed with me on the design of the rooms ha ha). Room staff were very courteous and pleasant, and i had no problems with staff not taking note of the DND signs. Our second stay was also in a Watsons Bay Room on the 24th floor. Again, a nice touch with a full friut basket, and i mean FULL, and a nice bottle of wine. The view is fantastic, and possibly after a while, better than the Harbour View.....you get to see all the way from the Opera House to Manly and the whole of the Botanical Gardens in these rooms. If you can, ensure its a full Watson Bay Room view......those at the side of the hotle are only corner window views. Room Service is ok but you may have to ask a couple of times to get anything. Food on room service is very good and good value. All in all i'd suggest the hotel takes a look at the likes of the Grand Stanford and takes note of the reviews it gets......it isn't for no reason that it's listed so far down the rankings of hotels in Sydney on TripAdvisor. I'ts actually justified, but i guess primarily on the design of the rooms and the reception areas.

At check-in, the attitude of the bored, disinterested clerk at reception couldn't have been less warm and cordial...she was mechanical at best. Told us we had been upgraded to a harbour view room on the club level, but in fact, we were not on the club floor. Then we had to fight with them to get the key cards that would let us into the club (they actually said we were upgraded to a club floor, which was not a club floor, but inconceivably, they balked when we asked for club access!!) The rooms were a mixture of tired and small bathrooms together with generally acceptable sleeping areas, but definately not 5 star quality. We sked for a coffee maker...none were available. Then we asked for a Bodum coffee plunger brewer. Three requests and five hours later, they sent a 2-cup bodum unit up. We were given a \"fruit basket\" on arrival, but it consisted of 2 apples with nothing else...not even a knife! The welcome card, incidentally, was addressed to us but our name was misspelled (even though our name on the registration card was correct). Keys quit working 3 times during our 3 day stay, necessitating 3 visits to the desk. The \"Club\" restaurant was disappointing...very over crowded on the nights we were there, perhaps because a large number of guests were staying there for a wedding. Not enough tables, dirty glasses everywhere, and the staff were overwhelmed. There were virtually no hors 'doevres at any time, and the clientelle looked like they were of \"bus tour\" mentality...as if they had never stayed in anything better than a Holiday Inn, and were going to grab and consume everything and anything in sight! I can see the staff being overwhelmed during the first night, but it was inexcusable during the next few nights (and during both breakfasts). Most IC Hotels give Club level guests the opportunity of eating breakfast either in the club itself, or in the main dining room, particularly when the club level is busy. They were emphatic in saying \"no\" when I asked...even though the main restaurant had a buffet set up which had very little business. As has been said before dozens of times on this site, the housekeepers knock on the doors way to early, whether the DND light is illuminated or not. Why is it necessary to do this at 8:30AM...even on weekends? The location is 5-Star, but the rest of the property is disappointing...3.5 stars at best.

The view is superb, (and we live in Sydney), the service is excellent and it is one of the best kept secrets in Sydney. However... ont he day we arrived it was being used for a corporate function so CHECK before you book otherwise I would stay somewhere else (like the Park Hyatt). The room we were given, though on the Executive Floor and meant to have view of the Harbour towards the open sea, faced an office block. Now technically if you craned your neck around the back of the bed you could catch a glimpse of the Harbour but we made them move us. And it was a fight. Despite being priority guests (having stayed at the hotel before and others in the chain), we were initially told there was only a smoking room available. When I \"asserted\" myself , I was told that there had been a last minute cancellation (really?) and we were eventually moved. Bad, bad customer care. The following morning when I went for a jog at 6.00am, I looked back at the hotel and noticed more than 60% of the room blinds were open. Either they had a lot of concellations or they had an in-flux of early risers! The bathrooms are small, though perfectly adequate, there is no seperate shower and it is not very powerful. The rooms are looking a bit tired and the windows could do with a clean. Not much point having a view of the Harbour if you are staring at it through dusty windows. However, the food is excellent and we think reasonably priced. Again, the benefit of the Club Lounge is that you can have breakfast overlooking one of the world's great views and you can eat outside at the 31 level which is possibly unique.

Our gateway city was Sydney so I used my Priority Club points to get a free night's stay. Based on my status as an Ambassador Club member, we were given a free upgrade to a corner suite overlooking the harbor with a nice view of the bridge but couldn't see the Opera house. The room (2142) was very nice: the furniture new and modern, the towels fluffy and soft, chocalates on the bed, free fruit and water were available to us as well. It was extremely quiet and we were able to sleep in until past 9:00 am without any noise bothering us at all. The location is great, we were able to take the train into Circular Quay and then it took us about ten minutes to walk up the hill to the hotel with our rolling suitcases. My wife was a little tired climbing the hill and perhaps I should have helped her with her suitcase but our general rule when traveling is that each person is responsible for their own luggage. By the time we arrived at approximately 11:00 pm on a Monday night, the restaurant inside the hotel was already closed. Room service was suggested to us but we prefered to go out so the City Extra restaurant down at the ferry terminal was suggested to us as it is open 24 hours a day. Eating at this restuarant was by far the worst experience we had during our stay in Australia. We wound up walking out and not paying but that's another story. The staff that we encountered at the hotel were all friendly and professional with the exception of the waiter at the coffee/cake stand on the ground floor. He ignored us for a good fifteen minutes while chatting with other customers. Perhaps it was my touristy attire of an Australian flag t-shirt and baggy shorts that gave the impression that we were not as important as the business people in their fine suits and Italian loafers. In the end, we decided to go out and spend our coffee money somewhere else. Using the internet at the business center was fairly expensive. Five minutes cost AU$5. But as I mentioned, it was a free night's stay and that was the only thing that I paid for.

All in all, a fine hotel. If you can get a good rate I would recommend staying here. However, if you are looking to be pampered and really enjoying a 5 star hotel experience, my advice would be to stay at the Shangri-La or Four Seasons (also in very good locations not far from the Intercontinental).", "Date": "March 3, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Liverpool U.K.", "Title": "\u201cIntercontinental\u201d", "Author": "Shoddy", "ReviewID": "UR4464268", "Content": "Loved it and would certainly stay there again, located very close to CircularQuay, which is central for busses trains and ferries.", "Date": "February 16, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Christiansted, St. Croix", "Title": "\u201cNice Hotel in Great City\u201d", "Author": "thepeacha", "ReviewID": "UR4384687", "Content": "We sure liked Sydney and IC was a good home to us.

Sunrise was right outside our window, the bench in front of the panorama windows let me very comfortably enjoy it every morning, since jet-lagged European tourists do not need much sleep in these morning hours!

One has to be careful though, since an apartment building in front most likely will spoil the view for the lower levels. But one can always enjoy the spectacular views from the top level swimming pool panorama windows (see picures). The room itself was spacious with a nice bathroom having a (lockable) window facing the panorama windows to enjoy the spectacular views while taking a shower! Room service was also excellent!

Upon Arrival on a friday at 2pm, i was told that firstly my room was not ready and to wait till 4pm, then i was told i was to be upgraded to a suite without club access. This was a malay/indian guy who was burly in size. After explaining that i paid for the Club Room and its expected that i be given club access, i was told no straight in the face by the manager tanya who then said that it was management decision not to upgrade any ambassadors members, only royal ambassadors. Not only that, she was extremely rude when she said that. She was almost condescending in her tone. Waited till 3.30pm pm only to be given a twin bedded room. I booked a king bedded room and the hotel does price the rooms differently. Upon arrival in the room and discovering the mistake, i phoned the reception only to be told they would accomodate but that the room would be ready later. Came back at 4.30pm, only to be told by danielle the front desk staff that i was explained earlier that my room was not ready and told to come back at 8pm. Not only that, she carried a surly face and wasn't polite at all. Decided to come back home and printed out the t & c of the ambassador programme. Called the hotel only to be told that my room would not be ready till 8.30pm. When i went back to the hotel at 8.30pm, i explained my situation to danielle who then said she didn't know of my ambassador status when i did passed an email stating my ambassador status to the earlier big burly sized guy. When danielle went to pull out the check-in sign sheet, she found the email as i told her. No apology at all. Asked to speak to the manager and was introduced to Mr. Bladdin. He was ok, apologetic and offered drinks on the bar. Declined the drinks at the bar and was told no suite at all available when at 2.30pm was offered a suite. Go figure.... Anyway, i did get my kind bedded room and i did get my club access for the 2 days. I did manage to get my suite for the 2nd night but only after i pursued it with the manager. I wasn't contacted at any time. In fact soon after entering the suite, i got a call from the front desk asking if i was checking out, when i was booked for 2 nights. The hotel definately failed on the service side. As for amenities, all rooms are basically the same size and the only difference in the view which you can get from a lot of the other hotels in the circular quay area which includes the Shangri-la, the Four Seasons, the Park Hyatt and even the stamford. You might get a view of the habour at the observatory which is amongst the best in sydney. In terms of bath amenities, mainly the club rooms and the suites get the hydro bottles which are nice but essentially the same as most other big chain properties. Unless you get a suite, chances are the bathroom is going to the standard small bathroom, almost similar to holiday-inn standard.. Its taht small with a bath and shower together. No seperate shower stalls and mainly dull white walls.

We landed in Sydney on 15th February 2005 at 6.30am. We caught the train from the airport into Circular Quay, this took about 15-20 mins.

There are beautiful lounges inside with panoramic views or there is an outside decked area where you can sit and soak up the sun as you look over Sydney Harbour and surrounds.
