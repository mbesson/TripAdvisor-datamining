We booked two rooms an Executive and Triple. The check-in process was quick and easy and the rooms where ready on our arrival at 2.00pm. We where aware of the size of the rooms from the website and communicating with other guest via Tripadvisor before booking, but where surprised as they seemed bigger than our expectations and we thought really good value in terms of Singapore hotel pricing (especially when travelling with teenage children). The rooms where well designed and looked very stylish with the wall coverings, silk orchards and taffeta curtains. There was more than enough space for our suitcases, laptops and toiletries. The two rooms where on the same floor as we requested and we had lovely views of the surrounding city. It was a pleasure to stay in a room that looked exactly like its website picture! The rooms where immaculately clean and the tiled floors felt far more hygienic than carpet. The bathroom was more of a wet room, but the design allowed the water to drain quickly and this was never an issue (I actually quite liked the bathroom as it was really functional). A bonus was an iron and ironing board. The toiletries supplied where also good quality and practical. The pool was also great and again larger than it appeared in the hotel pictures. A steam room, sauna and children's play ground was also located near the pool, great inclusions for a hotel in this price range. Service from the desk staff at the hotel was outstanding, Bernard was only too happy to assist us with internet and printing. Also when we passed staff in the corridors they always greeted us with a smile. Finally the biggest bonus is the location, minutes walk to Bugis shopping, food outlets and the MRT (which was a major cost saver as we used it instead of taxis). Our next visit to Singapore will definitely have the Parc Sovereign as number one on our list.", "Date": "April 14, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cNot worth your time or money!Small rooms rude staff and expensive even by Singapore standards food\u201d", "Author": "Mishspry", "ReviewID": "UR127334092", "Content": "Booked two rooms 1 for 2 people 1 for three clearly stating ages of children, checked this and was reassured all good arrived at hotel to find 1 bed in each room despite the second child being 8 years old as stated at booking time staff refused to assist having to wait 2 hours foe the manager who basically said bad luck.

It is closest to the Little India Station of the Purple Line and for visitors who intend to spend a lot of time in Sentosa Island and Universal Studios Singapore, this is is very ideal. You only need to board from the Little India Station and alight at the HarbourFront Station of Vivo City Mall and from there you can take the $3 LRT to Sentosa Island or the $1 Sentosa Boardwalk, either which way you choose in going to the island will be an experience in itself. From the airport this hotel can be accessed from the Bugis Station of the Green Line. From the Bugis station, just find Albert St. which is easily recognizable due to its paved walk way. The whole street is close to traffic with lots of stalls. From the Little India Station, you will need to take EXIT A, then walk towards Selagie St. you will pass by an India Movie house and reach an intersection from there you will cross towards Albert Village Court Hotel, walk through the Albert Village Court Hotel Courtyard and you will see Parc Sovereign. Note that once you get out of the station you will see the neon sign of Sim Lim Square, walk towards this building until you reach the intersection where you will cross to Albert Village Court. The hotel rooms are very simple, small and basic. No fuss, no decor, sparce and oftentimes cold and hard. Rooms and hallways are not carpeted so try getting a room at the end of the hall or else you will hear people passing through the halls or opening their doors. The staff are very accommodating and knowledgeable with directions so its best to ask them before leaving the hotel. Room service is fast and iron, iron boards, extra pillows, towels are brought to you immediately. The worst problem we had with the rooms were the showers and toilets which were poorly constructed. When the showers were used, the whole bathroom would be flooded and would take time to dry. If you wore shoes going inside, your room would have wet footprint. Yes the rooms will be very small and crammed, but ive stayed in Singapore hotels which had room far worse than Parc's so I think the rooms being clean outweighs its size. It wasnt the best value for money deal but it wasnt too bad due to its location which saves one from the trouble of walking too much and the sense of security which Albert St. can offer.", "Date": "March 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pecatu, Indonesia", "Title": "\u201cTerrible Value\u201d", "Author": "Joseph S", "ReviewID": "UR125967822", "Content": "Photos from their website are obviously meant to fool the potential customer into thinking they are getting quality.

Pros: It's a new hotel perfectly located in the heart of Bugis. Very accessible by taxi and just less than 10min walk between Little India and Bugis MRT stations. Particularly convenient for tourists as almost all of the basic needs are within walking distance such as restaurants, hawker centre & fruit stall, Sim Lim Square for gadget needs, Bugis Junction for affordable shopping/souvenirs, bazaars like OG Albert, BHG & more are nearby, there's also a Chinese drugstore, and a 7 eleven store is located just below the hotel. Our room in the 5/f was small & simple yet superbly clean & comfy, free of cigarette smoke & 2 spare pillows were available in the closet. Cons: 1. What we didn't like is that we were asked to pay SG$100 for deposit and for room cleaning since we requested for a Non-smoking room. 2. They don't offer free wifi, so if you really want to use the net, then just pay, its SG$6 for 2hrs. 3. The very small bathroom is flooded when using the shower! (No partition between shower & toilet). 4. Walls, I think, are made up of thin wood because you can hear banging of doors from the other room. 5. Hotel staff is not so welcoming.

I would still recommend it to my friends especially to those who are first timers in Singapore due to the proximity of the location and I'm giving a 3 star rating out of 5, to be fair, since we really didn't encounter major problems except for the cons listed above.

I agree it doesn\u2019t look much from the outside, but inside it is kept clean, efficient, excellent air conditioning, great variety and standard of food and cheap, lots of local eating there so a good sign of the quality of food. We ate there at least once each day. I would also recommend the Curry Restaurant in Albert Square next door to hotel. The MRT is impressive cheap, clean, efficient, easy to understand & air-conditioned. Tip \u2013 when you purchase tickets from machine you will be issued with a plastic style ticket, you will be paying $1 deposit on each journey which fully refundable, so make sure you reclaim after each journey, you simply do it via the ticket machine.

Its a real good option for those on a budget but otherwise I'd have preferred staying in the more touristy precincts of Marina or Clarke Quay. The other minus was I booked online indicating a family of four but instead got given a room for 3.", "Date": "November 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "bolton", "Title": "\u201cHotel good,avoid breakfast\u201d", "Author": "damaite", "ReviewID": "UR118964880", "Content": "Hotel was good and in a great location,Albert court is lovely and you are only 3 mins from Little India and the mtr.

Totally inadequate breakfast,from a restaurant that seems to do well at night as a chinese restaurant,not suited to morning breakfasts.

It took about 30 minutes to travel from the airport to the hotel. When I arrived at the hotel at Noon, I asked to check in early if possible (normal check in time is 3PM). I was told that there was a charge of $147.50 for early check in. This was quoted at the normal daily rate, not the price I paid with my package. I declined to pay the additional charge and sat in the lobby for 2 1/2 hours. At 2:30 PM an Asian Couple arrived and checked in as I watch them pay with their credit card. So I was disturbed that they had allowed this couple to check in while I continued to sit on the couch. I walked up to the front desk and demanded my room, after seeing the couple check in. The employee saw tha I was in no mood to discuss it and complied to get me a room. When I arrived in the room, the room was a total wreck. I turned and looked at the hotel employee and said this was unacceptable. He agreed and went down stairs and got me a new room. My new room was ready and I had no complaint. At 8PM I decided to retire early. Sometime later I was awakened by this banging noise on my door. It turned out to be the night latch that someone was opening and closing the door. I jumped out of bed undid the night latch and saw a drunk man an a hotel employee standing outside my door. I happened to notice that the man was holding a hotel key. I looked to the hotel employee and asked why I was being woken up and what this gentleman was doing with a key to my hotel room. He said that he was told the room was empty and he had helped this gentleman bring up his luggage. I informed him that it was very obvious that I was staying in the room and to please not disturb me again. The next day I went on a tour which included a lot of walking. This was ok except that the humidity was very high and I never stopped sweating. However, the driver of the tour bus was outstanding. He saw that I was not use to the weather and getting very hot he made me comfortable and offer his further assistance if needed. When I arrived back at the hotel, I purchased 2 days of internet service as I had mainly come to Singapore to rest. I also asked to speak to the manager so that I could inform him of the previous nights incident. I was told the manager was not in. I asked that they have him contact me we he arrived. I went to my room and disturbed to find that there was no bottled water, tap water is not always advisable to drink. So I took a shower and went to a store and bought water. The food in the hotel was not very good, especially the provided breakfeast included in the price of the hotel. The food had no seasoning that I could taste and the selection of food was sparse. The breakfast was not an international menu. I ate their only 1 more time and ordered off the menu. The foor was unremarkable. I went to the mall, there were 2 within walking distance and did some shopping. Again it was very humid. I purchased more water and returned to the hotel. As I entered the door I noticed the front desk handing some bottled water to some hotel guests. This was my 2nd day at the hotel, so I asked if the hotel provided bottle water in the rooms. They said yes. So I asked them why my room had no bottled water for 2 days? The auditor said He would bring the water up to my room himself right away. I went upstairs and turned on the internet and watched TV for more than 2 hours. No water arrived in my room. So I called back downstairs and asked if they would bring up my water. Shortly thereafter my water was delivered. I asked if they had laundry service available? The gentleman said yes just fill out the laundry request and put my clothes in the bag provided. I asked what bag and what laundry list as I had seen nothing like this. So this person check for both and found neither. He left and came back with both. When he handed them to me, I asked him if he had a pen as there was no pen or paper in the room. Also I asked about the manager and why he had not contacted me. Of course the hotel employee said he did not know. I called the Tour Operator and told them of my experience so far at this hotel. She said she would contact the Sales Manager and have him contact me. It about 30 minutes later the Sales Manager called asked to meet me downstairs. I agreed and sat down and explained to the sales manager, Patrick, all the problems I had encountered. Patrick thanked me for my \"good feedback\". He said that he would investiagate my concerns and get back with me. Bottom line, he never called me back. Prior to my checking out I asked to speak with him and he said, Yes, we are sorry. Turned and walked away.n I said loudly in the hotel lobby, Excuse ME? is that it. He said yes and enetered his office.", "Date": "May 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia", "Title": "\u201cgood location with bad services\u201d", "Author": "tree5", "ReviewID": "UR106906300", "Content": "A very good location where its only less than 10 minutes walk to Bugis MRT. you get a lot of local delicacies on your way to MRT, food, clothes and many more. basically you name it, you get it.
