The staff was fine, we had no problems. Our room was a bit small, anyway who spends his time in a hotel room in Rome, we used it only for sleeping, so it wasn't a problem for us. Hotel was clean, that is the most important thing in a hotel for me. I guess no rooms have a great view, Ours was looking at the street. I've noticed a couple of rooms have a bad view especially the ones at the breakfast floor. Wi-fi internet is free but the signal is very weak, so had to go down to lobby to connect to internet. Location is not bad, close to Termini however on the opposite side of everything to see in Rome, you have to walk 300 meters to the bus stop to go to Termini, which is only 2 stops away. It is also in a walking distance of 15 minutes. It is a good hotel to stay in Rome.

Much nicer than the seedier budget options near Termini. Not far from a Metro station, and also walkable from Termini if you have light luggage. Neighborhood is not touristy, though lots of restaurant options nearby. Supermarket down the street plus a great traditional fruit/vegetable market at the corner as well. I had a single, room 307, modern decor -- looks like the rooms have been recently renovated. This room also has a balcony (one of only two in the hotel) that look out onto a quiet residential courtyard. Refrigerator/mini bar, and older CRT TV. Breakfast was included in the rate, and was quite good, including hot options like scrambled eggs and bacon, along with rolls, ham, cold cuts, cheese, and the ample sweet cakes as mentioned by other reviews. Since it was Easter, they also had lots of chocolate eggs. A few drawbacks. The shower stall in the otherwise spacious bathroom was tiny and the doors didn't seal well, so water got onto the floor outside. The toilet seat wasn't well-aligned so was wobbly. The room safe was malfunctioning (sounded like gears were slipping in the lock). The hotel is happy to let you store your luggage after checkout, but the storage facility is a room without any real security and access and retrieval of your bags is on the honor system. If you can live with that level of security ambiguity, you will be fine. Finally, the public toilet on the ground floor did not have a toilet seat (apparently not unusual in public toilets in Rome!), so I pitied the women guests who needed to use it to freshen up. All in all, as I said in my headline, good value for money if you are willing to make some compromises, are self-sufficient, and perhaps have been to Rome before.", "Date": "April 11, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ottawa", "Title": "\u201cGreat economy hotel\u201d", "Author": "GlobalguyOttawa", "ReviewID": "UR126122102", "Content": "You will find good value here if you don't expect too much.

In brief it is a simple, quiet hotel targeting mostly business travellers.

However, with the frequency of the Roman Transport System (bus every 3-5 minutes), it was not a big deal afterall.

There are high ceilings, elevators, solid air-conditioning, soft slippers, plush towels, and a normal-sized shower. Our room was really, really clean! Also, it was a great value for what we paid! The only bad thing about the hotel is that it is not close to the train station or anything touristy, like the Colosseum or the Vatican.
