So when I decided to go to Novotel in Montreal, I was expecting the same standards. Unfortunately, it was the whole opposite. The worst part has to be the customer service. The receptionists never said \"hello\" when we entered (we always had to say hi first) and they never told us there was a gym or told us about the breakfast (the prices and the hours). Some smiles would have been nice too! The construction going on in the whole lobby was very disturbing and the temporary front desk is a mess! During the reservation, they should have told us about this because it was very unpleasant and disturbing. No compensation was given for this. When we decided to talk to a manager about this, she told us it was just the last finishing touches and that's why they don't mention it during the reservation call. But I saw just minutes ago a comment by Novotel Montreal to another customer on TripAdvisor saying that the renovations were going to finish March 2012. We're April 16th. So if there's still a month of renovations, I think it's unacceptable not telling the guests. By the way, our complaint wasn't really taken seriously by this person, which was very offending. I would never go back to this hotel.", "Date": "April 16, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Alberta, Canada", "Title": "\u201cSnooty Staff To Go With Overprice\u201d", "Author": "Friendly_Reviewer", "ReviewID": "UR127888433", "Content": "Chose this hotel to be close to Bell Centre - it ticked that box that's all.

I had tickets to attend a Montreal Canadiens game with my 73 year old father. We are both lifetime Habs fans and had never been to a game in Montreal so we were very excited to attend the game. Overall the stay at the hotel was average. The room was clean and the staff was pleasant. I don't speak French and they were more than willing to speak English to accommodate me. I use a CPAP machine when sleeping and had to unplug the headboard lights to plug it in when I first arrived. After returning from lunch and a visit to the Bell Centre I found that my CPAP had been unplugged and they had supplied me with a power bar without my having to ask. The first impression however when we first entered the hotel was not a positive one. The lobby was being renovated and looked horrible, noisy and cramped. I'm sure it will look much better when it's completed but in our case it was not a positive experience. We were directed to the second floor to check-in. A nice young woman was waiting at a makeshift desk directly in front of the elevators and check in was quick. Considering all of the unsolicited emails I received from the Novotel over the months leading up to our stay, it might have been nice of them to mention in one of them about the renovations taking place.

Our purpose of this trip was a hockey weekend in Montreal and we couldn't have picked a more suitable hotel, at least location wise. It is literally across the parking lot from the Bell Centre. We could look out our window and see the arena. Check-in went smoothly - we were on our way to the 9th floor in no time. I will say I was a bit scared when I got off the elevator on the 9th floor to a wall full of fresh plaster. They were doing renovations to the hallways and carpeting on the 9th floor. Other than that first morning there, it was pretty much a non-issue. There were working by 8am but that didn't matter since we were up early on and on the go. By the time we returned Friday evening, it was completed (new wallpaper) and everything was taken away. The room - I would consder average. Beds were decent with good bedding (white duvets, etc). The bathroom was the highlight - very nice, but the shower lacked pressure. Overall, good value for the money. We did eat in the restaurant for a light breakfast. Be prepared to pay hotel prices - $15 breakfast buffett - we had a \"trio\" for $8 which was toast, and any two choices of something from a contential menu (cereal, fruit, etc). Another highlight is the great location and proximity to Ste. Catherine Street. You're just half a block away from the major shopping/restaurant district in Montreal. I would recommend eating Breakfast at \"Reuben's Deli, Desserts and Steaks\" on Ste. Catherine. An amazing breakfast menu for great prices. Very nice inside place too.

The location of the hotel is excellent - right in downtown Montreal, close to the Bell Centre and one block from Rue St. Catherine. Unfortunately my experience at this hotel was not positive, although I went prepared to like it as my co-worker recommended it highly. I am a very easy-going and positve traveler (check my other reviews) and travel with a good attitude, but this hotel left me frustrated. On the morning after my first night, I asked if someone could help me turn on the closed-captioning on the television because I am severely hearing-impaired. I had tried repeatedly without success. Despite repeated requests throughout my stay, nobody could ever do so. On my second night I decided to have dinner in the hotel's restaurant, L'O. After waiting a very long time to be seated in spite of the many empty tables, I was taken to a booth where I was promptly forgotten. After about fifteen minutes I was given a menu; it was approximately 20 minutes later when someone remembered to take my order. After I finished my meal, there was an interminable wait before someone brought the cheque. Dinner took 1 and 1/2 hours - not unreasonable if dining with companions and conversation, but entirely too long for someone dining alone. On my last day in town, I rushed back to the hotel on a break in my meeting (in a nearby building) to print my boarding pass to save time when getting my flight. The computer was an Apple, one of which I haven't used in a decade or more, and I wasted precious time trying to figure out how to open a browser. I had to ask for help which meant trying to attract the attention of one of the front desk staff without losing my place at the internet station. (Note to Novotel - Apples are very fine computers I'm sure but they're NOT what business travelers are familiar with. And we don't have time to take a \"remedial hipness\" course when traveling on business.) When I was finally able to check into my flight online and printed my boarding pass, it came out a pale, pale grey, white-streaked mess because of an empty ink cartridge. It certainly wasn't going to be possible to use. I pointed this out to a front desk staff person and her response was to remove the ink cartridge and shake it back and forth a few times. I have no idea if it helped (I doubt it, that cartridge was really near-dead) because the website wouldn't let me print it again anyway. I had to get a new one at the airport, which cost me time. The hotel is very well located, reasonably priced at $139, and the rooms are quite chic (even if they do hide the hair dryers in a drawer - I found mine by accident during a room check to make sure I hadn't left anything behind on checkout) and has the potential to be a great stay, but the attention to service is sorely lacking.

The towels were small, very rough and many of the stained. The housekeeping staff is numerically challenged. We had 3 people in our room. One day, they left us 4 bath towels and 1 wash cloth. Then we had no toilet paper. I had to ask 4 times for extra wash cloths & toilet paper and was promised each time they would be brought to the room - never happened. The next morning, I finally got a front desk person who responded to my request. There is a restaurant in the hotel which has a passable breakfast buffet, not exorbitantly priced.

While on vacation with my fiance, my iPhone was stolen out of my room and then destroyed. Overall, my experience was horrible and one that I will never forget. What is most upsetting is not that my phone was stolen from my room. It was the way the hotel dealt with the matter and the suspicious story we were told about the missing phone. My iPhone was removed from my room and was miraculously found only after I stated that I would need to talk to corporate because there was now a threat of potential identity theft. I was told that the phone was found in the laundry but it was damaged beyond use and that it was unfortunate but out of the hotel's control. The hotel sent me my phone and it was very interesting that the phone was missing its case, which was a very tightly fitting protective shell. It is evident that someone removed the phone from the case. Furthermore, the damage was clearly not due to being washed in the laundry machine. Instead, it looked as if someone smashed the face of the phone with a hammer. The back of the iPhone was completely in tact. Again, the case would NOT have come off and thus, it is proof that someone removed the phone from the case. Lastly and most importantly, the phone had no water damage as the hotel claimed. Whether it was the housekeeper's negligence or not, the hotel is ultimately responsible for my damaged property. I feel like I was robbed by both the maid and the hotel. Worse then having my personal property stolen, was management's lack of response. It took nearly 2 weeks and a message to Novotel corporate for the GM to respond to my emails. The GM finally emailed me after 2 weeks to say that he would be willing to share some of the cost to replace my phone. However, when I responsed that I would be amenable to this situation and would like more information on how to proceed, I did not receive a reponse. It has been nearly 2 weeks and I have yet to hear anything from him... I doubt I ever will. Sadly, my fiance and I lost our last night in Montreal because of this ordeal.

We booked two rooms at Novotel around ~$135/room. The location is wonderful; it is only a few minutes away from shopping, restaurants and night life! Everything is accessible by foot! We drove from Boston and left our cars in the hotel's parking lot ($18/day per car). Space is limited and some spaces are difficult to get into. The parking attendant shows you where to park. Check-in was smooth. Half of us arrived early and even though the rooms were booked under my friend's name, Kaela at the front desk allowed us to check into one of the rooms. I just had to give my friend's name and my credit card. The double room was spacious but the lighting was strange - the room wasn't very well lit and only has spots of light around the room. The doorway was well-lit however. The double beds were rather small, full-size, instead of the usual queen that I'm used to in the US but nevertheless, they were adequate. The hotel's pillows fell flat very quickly and did not offer much head/neck support. The bathroom on the other hand was clean and had plentiful lighting. The shower head was strange as well and did not point outward downward. One would have to stand directly under the shower head. Otherwise, as the other reviews have said, don't touch the mini-bar unless you plan on using it, it's touch sensor and you get charged automatically. The picture clarity of their TV was bad considering that they did have new flat panel televisions and not many channels were available. Since we didn't spend a lot of time in our rooms, the TV wasn't a big issue. Internet with the ethernet cable is $10 for $24 hrs. Overall, the rooms were very clean and comfortable. The hotel doesn't have a pool or jacuzzi. The gym is small and limited. They do have the standard soda machine and ice machine in the halls. My friends and I did not eat at D'or, the hotel restaurant but it was priced as other restaurants were in the area. I had an incident where I had left a small plastic baggie of brand new contact lenses on the bathroom counter next to the water glasses. My friends and I left for the afternoon and when we returned, the baggie of contact lenses was gone. I thought that the maid must have thrown them away. I called the front desk to file a complaint and the person I talked to said she would speak to housekeeping. She called me back 15 min later and told me that housekeeping was not allowed to throw away or touch anything on the bathroom counters but anything left on the floor would probably be thrown away. I replied that I was positive that I had left them on the counter and that the maid had definitely touched the counter because all of my friends' toothbrushes and toiletries had been moved. Again, the front desk said she would speak to housekeeping again. I did not receive an apology. I also never received a call back. So, be careful where you leave your personal things!

Not only are there the obvious privacy issues, but if someone gets up to use the bathroom in the middle of the night, the bathroom light floods the entire room, waking everyone else. Ridiculous. The toiled is also quite oddly placed UNDER the bathroom counter. Not a major issue, but quite strange. There are about a half dozen different lights and lamps around the room. While I admit a number of them are trendy and stylish, the room is still too dark to comfortably read a book with ALL of those lights on. I can appreciate modern design, even cheapish IKEA modern design, but it should never interfere with comfort and functionality, especially in a hotel. Otherwise it was alright. Pretty well located to do some sight-seeing in Montreal. It's also in the middle of what appears to be the business district. Parking and Wi-Fi are not free; a little disappointing in the 21st century. The room service menu looked great, if a bit pricy. If you end up staying here, you can certainly have a perfectly acceptable experience, but I would honestly recommend looking at other hotels in the price range first.

The bedside light is a dim panel light set into the wall, which made it quite difficult to read in bed at night if you weren't facing in exactly the same direction as the light. The housekeeping staff came in every day - at least, they made the bed every day - but some days it was apparent that they hadn't cleaned much in the bathroom, e.g. soap rings still in the tub and no restocked supplies.

Just for reassurance, I called the hotel (after I booked with Hotels.com) to ask direct questions about the Novotel Montreal Center a/k/a Novotel Montreal Downtown. I was told with effusive enthusiasm by a staff member that I would be staying in a renovated room called a Novation Room. When I arrived during the holidays, I was not impressed with the room, which looked to me like it had received a cookie-cutter remodeling. The mini French doors to the corner bathroom were cute but could not hide the dirty floors and vanity. There was hair on the floor and sink as well, which I found unacceptable. The bed was comfortable but nowhere along the lines of the bed I had at L'Hotel XIXe siecle earlier in the year. With the exception of two staff members, service was poor at this hotel. I will always remember the snootiness of one staffer and the reluctance of another staffer in looking at my phone bill. I needed that person to check my bill because she had cited an alarmingly high amount that made no sense because I was using a phone card (purchased on rue St-Catherine on my first day of arrival). After rereading some reviews of this Novotel here on TripAdvisor and seeing that others were automatically billed for simply opening the minibar door or touching the water bottles, I now figure that maybe that's what happened to me. I didn't touch the water bottles, but, sure, I opened the minibar door just to see what was in there. I shouldn't be billed for curiosity. No one should. Anyway, I spoke with the reluctant staffer face to face, and she straightened everything out. The hotel's restaurant was this Novotel's best feature, despite the high prices. But then again, nearly all hotel restaurants have exorbitant prices. The meals at the Novotel's restaurant -- I can't recall its name -- are delicious. The host and server were friendly and bilingual during my stay. And, by the way, if you really like the service in the restaurant, let your tip reflect that. Don't be cheap. If you are trying to save money, don't eat at a hotel restaurant. Go out and find a diner, pizzeria or a cafe. There are plenty within reach of the Novotel, especially nearby on rue St-Catherine and rue Crescent. In fact, please keep in mind that there are many restaurants in Montreal, period. Not just in Centre-Ville , a/k/a downtown Montreal proper. Why not venture out farther into the city, to Plateau Mont-Royal, Miles End, Chinatown. etc. Warning: If you ever stay at this Novotel or any downtown Montreal hotel on Christmas day, either dine at the hotel's restaurant or venture out to Old Montreal, where many restaurants are open and practically beg you to come in. Why? Most restaurants and other establishments are closed on Christmas. By the way, I do not agree with one reviewer that Old Montreal is an easy walk from this Novotel. When I needed to travel to Old Montreal on one day of my visit, I took a taxi and paid $8 -- and I had my eye on the meter. If you don't want to take a cab, take the metro to Old Montreal and then take a taxi back to your hotel, especially if you are dining late into the night. The taxis are always frequent in Old Montreal, so you will not have a problem. The reason I would not recommend you take the metro to return to this Novotel is that the area is quite desolate at night. With the lots adjacent to the hotel, it can be dreary and spooky. If you have young children in tow or are a solo traveler and need to get to Old Montreal at night, I strongly would advise asking the Novotel front-desk staff to call you a car. Or just walk one long block (that is, rue de la Montagne) up to rue St-Catherine, where you can hail a taxicab. Then, again, I strongly urge you to catch a taxi after you finish dining and/or touring in Old Montreal at night so that you can return safely to the Novotel. For those folks staying five days to a week at the Novotel and buying an unlimited metro card, be aware that it must be used for three consecutive days of travel. So you will find yourself needing to use a taxi here and there, anyway. On my past visits to Montreal, I found it easier to take the metro to a destination (unless I was traveling there really late at night, in which case I took a taxi), and then I would take a taxi back to whatever hotel I was staying at. I forgot to mention room service at the Novotel Montreal Center a/k/a Novotel Montreal Downtown. Oops, sorry -- I never got a chance to HAVE room service. The prices were expectedly high, so that wasn't the reason I didn't have room service. Instead, the door tag showing my choices for room service was never removed from the door, and I had left my room in the morning and returned late that night. It was so late that it was actually the next morning. Booking this Novotel has taught me a lesson. Next time, I will not stay there. I do not blame Hotels.com; that company cannot possibly keep up with every little renovation at all of the hotels around the world. Next time, I'd rather pay a bit more money and stay at one of the boutique hotels in Old Montreal, where the service never fails to be personal (almost intimately so) and superior. You do not need to stay at a big-chain hotel downtown or elsewhere in Montreal to have a decent breakfast, lunch or dinner at the on-site restaurant, either. Or to have the concierge help you plan a last-minute day trip. At a boutique hotel, you might find a hospitality desk rather than a concierge because the staffers tend to wear different hats. But you surely will not have a motel experience as I did at this Novotel, which is really great at offering barebones service (every iota of sarcasm intended, here).", "Date": "December 31, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dallas, TX", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location and a good hotel\u201d", "Author": "Tom_Sowell", "ReviewID": "UR11696851", "Content": "My wife, son, and myself stayed there primarily for the location.

This was our first trip to Montreal. We booked the October special, a \"Novation\" room with a king size bed (breakfast buffet included) for $159/night. I would skip the breakfast included option if I stayed in this hotel again as there are many places to eat for less within a few minutes walk. L'O Restaurant is trendy in decor but average in food and not many people eating there. Hotel is located on the dirtier end of Rue de la Montagne, but only one block from Rue St. Catherine. So, the location is just right, and very close to bars, restaurants and clubs on Crescent street. The staff was friendly but not very attentive. I asked three times for a few extra pillows (twice at front desk and left message for housekeeping) and amazingly they failed to respond to this simple request. The maid cleaned the room despite having left the do not disturb sign on the door (we didn't want the room serviced). The room was modern, but fairly small. It did have a nice flat screen tv, comfortable bed with clean linens/duvet cover, decent air conditioning and clean bathroom with modern fixtures. Otherwise the room was very basic. All mini-bar items bill automatically upon touching the item so be careful (even the water bottles on the counter are on sensors). Parking on street is hit or miss. There is a garage next to the hotel and I would recommend taking advantage of this option for CAD 15/night (you can go in and out of the garage with the pass they give you). Overall, Novotel Montreal Center is a good value but don't pay more than CAD 120/night as I don't believe the room or service is worth more (also beware that the room rates do not include the hefty taxes they tack on).", "Date": "October 11, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "St.John's", "Title": "\u201cGreat location,reasonable value\u201d", "Author": "dkeith", "ReviewID": "UR8608109", "Content": "Have stayed at this property on a couple of other occasions and this stay only confirmed my reasons for returning.

The new Novation rooms are good size and nicely fitted- nothing that stands out just good overall impression ( the air conditioning was noticeably quiet however-what a nice change from so many other properties). Downside - the in house restaurant is pricey but lots of options in very close proximity (there are at least 4 within 150 feet of the front door - 3 high end) with lots of reasonably priced options on Crescent -about a 3 minute walk. Second -I would agree with another review on the linen -the towels are getting tired -time for some new linen. TIP: The airport shuttle stops at only 3 locations (the first being the Sheraton) and you then have to transfer to a minibus to get to other hotels -time consuming and tiring if you have been on the road for awhile.

On those three points, this hotel delivered better than I expected. Crescent Street in Montreal is where I intended on drinking and fine dining and this hotel was literally a block and a half from some of the finer restaurants. FYI: I ate at a restaurant on Crescent St. beside a club named 7 and it was fantastic. I don't remember the exact name of the restaurant but on my credit card it was billed as WIENSTEIN GAVINO. Anyways, it was recommended to me from the receptionist at Novotel and I think it was an absolutely excellent pick. Their filet mignon was to die for and the service/decor was exactly what I requested when I asked for her advice. The other thing was we booked a middle-tier room referred to as a \"Novation\" room which was really nice. It was standard in size and had a small couch and flat screen television. We received a good deal because I found the hotel on hotels.ca and called the hotel directly to get a better deal. They gave me a price of $130 per night (with tax) but no option for cancellation and this was an excellent deal relative to the other hotels in the area. Would I recommend this hotel? Absolutely. Like I said earler: bang for your buck it is the best deal. All the name brand shopping (parasuco, steve madden, etc.) and department stores (simones, the bay) are within a 5 block strip on St. Catherines Street, the restaurants and bars are close by, and it is only a $13 cab ride to the casino.

We were transfered to a number of someone who deals with this sort of thing. We left a message and she did call us the next day saying she had no coat. She then told us (after a bit of polite but firm insisting that the coat was in fact left in the room) that we may be making this up and since this particular cleaner who cleaned our room had been with the company for 5 years. She also told me there was a process of paperwork to fill out when items are left in the rooms. This was not done. This led me to believe that the cleaner was the one who took it. She personally checked the closet again because she said no one stayed there the next night (so no guest took the coat). Then I told her in not so polite terms to get my coat back. We did not hear from her since then. We then called the General Manager who told us he would look into this immediately and call us back right away. He never called back. My wife call 7 times in one day and his receptionist told us she could see him sitting at his desk but the call would not transfer through. So we left our phone number again, and still no call back. So we called back again and his receptionist then told us he had gone home for the day. So I am still missing my leather coat and I still have not heard back from the novatel hotel.

She was very helpful and patient in making recommendations of things to do. The location is excellent! It's a block away from one of the main shopping streets in the City and a block from the restaurant strip. We were pleasantly surprised at the amount of pubs with live (Celtic) music ... all within walking distance of the hotel. We didn't check out the hotel restaurant ... we ran out of time ... and it looks a bit pricy. The train station is only five blocks away, easily withiin walking distance even dragging a suitcase on wheels. We walked back and forth to Old Montreal twice and walk to/up the \"mountain\". We caught a subway, which was just a couple blocks away, to the Biodome. Everyone smokes everywhere in Montreal including restaurants and the hotel lobby. Nasty!

We ate dinner at the hotel our first night, and were apprehensive (primarily because it looked like dining area was an afterthought), but it was very, very good, and again, the staff was great.

LOCATION, LOCATION, LOCATION!!!! This place is smack dab right in the middle of where you want to be. You are surrounded by restaurants, tourist activities, and very short cab rides to Old Montreal and the Montreal Casino. I was very impressed with the location and I didnt plan on being impressed with the hotel, only because of how affordable it was and where it was situated, but I thought the hotel was very nice. The rooms were more than sufficiant, the employees were very gracious and friendly and the hotel itself was always clean and the decor was quite trendy. My party and I which contained 4 gentleman ranging in ages of 25 to 29 arrived at about 2 in the afternoon on a Thursday. Parking is a little rough only because the lot is rather tight and hard to navigate, but if you can drive, you can handle it. The lot will run you about $15.50 per night Canadian. Upon parking we checked in with a very nice young lady who was fluent in French and English. We had seperate reservations, one for one night and one for 3 nights and she politly gave us one room each for all 4 nights without a problem. We acuired great rates for this hotel in advance paying only $89 per night American, and I think that is a great rate considering the Montreal Candaians were having their first game of the NHL playoffs that Sunday night. Did I mention that the Bell Centre where they play is litterally 200 yards down the st from the hotel. Upon getting into our rooms, we were pleased. We had 2 double beds, a decent size TV and a mini bar.We had a very nice view out onto Rue De Montange and to the north of us we could see Catherine St and to our South, the Bell Centre. The hotel has a very nice new looking dining room and bar with friendly employees. If you are looking for a nice hotel at a budget price where everything you need is witin a very short walk, you will be pleased with Novotel. All and all we had a great trip, beautiful city and very nice people.

Even though we were in the middle of all the action we did not find it to be a noisy hotel. The most noise we heard was when all the rowdy hocky fans came from New York and even that was minimal. The staff was very nice and courteous. They did not volunteer any information but when asked they were accommodating.

The walls are built solid as a rock. No worries about hearing the people above, below, or next to you playing loud music, yelling, snoring, having ludicrous s--, or hearing their phone ring. The only caveat is that I stayed in the executive novation style room which may have a more solid structure. These rooms are in the center of each floor. They are only next to 1 room. When you look out the window of this type room, you see the same thing right across from you. That is, two rooms side by side, going up a column for 9 floors. -Showers gave me the ultimate clean feeling. They were those round showers that rain water down on you. They also had an extra flexible shower sprayer. -Fitness room was posh. -Great pay per view selection. THE BAD: -Location is on a two way cramped street called Rue de La Montagne. It's pretty decent, but not right in a hot spot or anything. -The reviews I read on this site were true. Staff is young and inexperienced. -Fitness room does exist, but only 1 elevator leads to it. -No pool. -Room service is closed at midnight, but there is a nearby restaurant serving sandwiches, pizza, etc., open for delivery until 5:00am. Make sure to ask the inexperienced staff about it or they may not tell you. -Smoking allowed in the lobby and it stinks. Well, that's Montreal. THE UGLY: -Some staff were rude and snooty, but that could be the Canadian attitude. I don't mean this as an insult. Factual business reports state that customer relationships are not a priority for 85% of Canadian businesses. -No refrigerator in the room which was lame. The small one that was in the room was full of stuff that you don't want to touch or you will be charged an exhorbitant amount of money by the company they sub-contract out to. -Parking garage is $15.50/night and there's not enough room. The spaces are made for small cars. -You must pay for internet which is cheap, cheap, cheap when you're paying nearly $170/night Canadian ($135 USD) for an executive novation room. -You even pay for breakfast - cheap, cheap, cheap. -The hotel driveway entrance is so small, your car could get stuck waiting if the owner of the car in front of you is busy checking in.", "Date": "February 27, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ottawa, Ontario", "Title": "\u201cFar Surpassed Our Expectations.\u201d", "Author": "dabuizm", "ReviewID": "UR4366695", "Content": "We stayed at the Novotel for one night and were very satisfied with the hotel overall.

We had no problems with the hotel other than the fact that one pillow had a tar-like spot on it. I called the hotel manager who quickly came up to the room with a set of new clean pillows and a sincere apology. The filipino housemaid, Esther, accompanied her and was very friendly to me. I told her I was happy with the state of the room and she explained that there were newly renovated rooms (for a higher price) upstairs - for those looking for extra comfort. There is no pool, but if you are in Montreal, you shouldn't be wasting time in a pool anyways.
