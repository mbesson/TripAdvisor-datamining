On the last night of my stay, a Saturday night, I was awakened by a firestorm of foot stomping, door slamming and running footfalls above my first floor room. Either a bunch of kids were running up and down the hallway, or somehow someone was racing back and forth across the room above me. On about the 50th time in 15 minutes, I called the front desk and reported the issue. The clerk said they'd investigate. Some 90 minutes (!) later, I was finally able to get back to sleep. The extremely high noise level kept going. And going. And going. Well past 3 AM. At 6 AM Sunday morning I was up for my activities and dead on my feet. I went to the front desk to complain and conversed with a clerk who apparently hadn't worked the overnight shift.

We were given a room on the third floor (good so far). When we got to the room and opened the curtain it was practically impossible to see out window due to the pigeon poo that COVERED the window.

Upon arrival, I asked the front desk staff for a roll away bed and was told \"We have one, but it is locked up and there is no mattress for it.....\" Okay.....???? She was helpful in getting me some extra blankets and pillows, however. Overall, the breakfast was really great with a variety of foods, including some tasty breakfast burritos, hot waffles, hard boiled eggs, etc.... I liked the hotel and would definately stay there again. Maybe they will have a mattress for the roll way the next time I come.....", "Date": "November 27, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "California", "Title": "\u201cNice and New\u201d", "Author": "xtreat", "ReviewID": "UR8526087", "Content": "We booked this particular La Quinta because its location off I-10 was convenient for our long roadtrip.

There were a couple of shady characters hanging around outside, but we never felt unsafe.

We needed three rooms and most of Phoenix was booked due to sports events taking place in the area. We could only find rooms here and at the Hampton on the other side of I-10 that would be anywhere near the area where we needed to be so after sending a family member to scout out the two properties, this one was deemed to be preferable. One reason it was preferable is that while it is close to the interstate it does not sit directly on it, but is located somewhat back from the traffic. There is a row of other budget hotels between this property and the interstate highway--a Travel Lodge and some local extended stay hotel. So you do not hear the traffic noise from the interestate in this property--some noise from McDowell, a five-lane busy street, but not loud enough to be annoying. The hotel is new as the previous person posted and still had a banner proclaiming it as \"Now Open\" when we arrived 3/22. Our rooms were listed as suites and we paid $124/nt. for them. They were spacious with a separate sofa, two chairs, a round table, coffee table and desk with leather swivel chair as well as the dresser, two night tables, and the tall wooden cabinet that held the flat-screen TV and contained a fridge and microwave. There were two phones, one portable, and there was ethernet connectivity at the desk. The desk had multiple electrical outlets which was a nice feature. The bathroom had a single sink in the marble counter and a tub with shower. Good water pressure. There was a coffee pot in the bathroom, and an ironing board and iron in the closet. The closet had a mirrored door and there was a full length mirror on the opposite wall--another thoughtful item. The furniture appeared to be nicer than that found in many discount hotels and I did not have any problem with the bed or the pillows. Standard thin flowered covering on the bed, thin towels, and basic amenities in the bathroom. The breakfast in the morning was adequate--two waffle machines to make y our own waffle--pastries, bagels, white bread, cereals, juices (orange, grapefruit, apple), fruit (apples,oranges, bananas), and coffee. There is a loud flat-screen TV in the breakfast area and the breakfast crowd seemed to be mostly young people with their coaches. Despite the large number of what appeared to be sports teams at the hotel the place was very quiet. There were menus of area restaurants at the front desk and the staff seemed willing to help. I did not visit the fitness room or business center nor did I notice if the pool was functioning. We did not spend much time at the property except to sleep. There is a Sonic and a Pollo Loco within walking distance and a large Chevron station with a convenience store at the corner of McDowell and 51st. There is a Waffle House and several small local places across the five lanes of McDowell. There is a Food City Grocery, also across the street and within walking distance if one is up to crossing the busy street. Most of the businesses in the area have Spanish names and it appears to be a very bustling commercial district with what appears to be multi-family housing directly across the street from the hotel. I say appears to be because there is a high concrete block wall separating McDowell from these units. I saw policemen pull cars over on McDowell on two of my trips back to the hotel at night so it seems to be an area with a lot of police presence, but I did not feel uncomfortable at the hotel.If I had been traveling alone I think I would have still felt comfortable as the parking lot is well-lit and there appears to be a fair amount of pedestrian traffic in the area. The only problem we experienced here was with the elevator. We were on the third floor and the elevator often stopped on the second floor and refused to go to the third floor. On the day we were checking out with lots of luggage we waited with many others at the elevator. One couple waiting said they had been stuck on the elevator the day before. We finally gave up and walked down the stairs carrying our heavy suitcases.
