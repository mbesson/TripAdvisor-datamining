{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Quiet, small hotel embedded in a clinic We spent five nights here for a very reasonable price: about as cheap as I could find in its class in Berlin. The hotel is very modern, clean, and efficient, very much like a business hotel in appearance. However, it has the unusual feature of being surrounded by a large medical clinic, and even shares the use of the swimming pool with the clinic. This means there is a fair amount of day traffic around the hotel, as well as a number of places where a doorway leads from the hotel into one part of the clinic or another. It also means the pool is available for very limited hours on weekdays.I'd highly recommend the Schlosspark to anyone who's visiting Berlin by auto, as the parking is free and the hotel is located close enough to a major avenue that you can be down at the Zoo or other attractions within a few minutes. The breakfast buffet is good. We did not try the restaurant for dinner, as there are plenty of restaurants within 4-5 blocks.The hotel and clinic abut the Charlottenburg Palace park, so the location is absolutely quiet at night, which is a big plus. We would return again.", "Date": "Aug 28, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR894408270", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "spaceagepop"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187323-d232609-r5715536-Schlosspark_Hotel-Berlin.html", "HotelID": "232609", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
