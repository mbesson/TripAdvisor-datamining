We went on our honeymoon, and could not have stayed at a better place than Puri Cendana. This place is pristine, quiet, amazingly beautiful, has a swimming pool most 5 star hotels cant beat and provides complete privacy to every guest. The best part of this resort is that its a stone's throw away from the beach. For vegetarians. like us, there is a good Indian restaurant close by that serves veg food. The restaurant staff too went out of their way to cook vegetarian for us. Will not consider any other place anytime we visit Bali again.", "Date": "Nov 14, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR697959298", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "AyushJ"}, {"Content": "LOVED IT! My partner and I were going to to book into the Sofitel next door where our friends were staying, unfortunately they didnt have any rooms left, so we started to drag our backpacks and surfboards up the road to find somewhere else, we popped into the Puri and booked a room (3nights) for about 50US a night, (financially cheap in Sept, not so good now). I absolutely loved the hotel, the lush gardens were beautiful, the room was not posh but very suitable decor for a tranquil balinese hotel. It was very quiet and peaceful, much nicer than when we went into to the Sofitel, there were so many guest, and all of the staff spoke fluent english and i dont think you get to experience real Indonesia in a huge resort like that. Seminyak is the best area in Kuta to stay, there is all the best night clubs like double 6 etc, and Kut De Ta which is a must for all travellers to bali, is just a stone throw away along the beach from the Puri. We also came back a week later after travelling and bought other friends along to stay and they loved it too! I would reccommend this hotel for anyone who wants to stay in Seminyak for a reasonable price!! I will be staying there again on my next visit!", "Date": "Nov 5, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR683592763", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Tassie-Travellers64"}, {"Content": "nice but staff too sleepy we stayed 1 night in this hotel which has a very good location(between the sea and the center)Nice swimming pool but staff too sleepy and not so friendly...the restaurant of the hotel is quite expensive but food is fresh and good.the room was too dark and the bathroom needs to be improved.however, I would recommend this hotel for its location.", "Date": "Sep 19, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR367065480", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "estelle75"}, {"Content": "Good Value For Money But... I did not want to pay a lot for lodging, and I was prepared for a barebones hotel. However, I was still disappointed at my two-night stay at Puri Cendana.What I liked about this place was the beautiful garden, relaxing atmosphere and friendly staff. My room was two-storey and the upstairs bedroom was quite cute with simple Balinese furniture. The turnoffs include the noise from the main street and the paper-thin walls (I could hear my neighbor clearly.) The room was dim and it was hard to see at night.I liked the king-size bed but the pillows and mattress were not very comfortable.Since the air conditioner unit was upstairs, the living room downstairs was not very cool. The furniture was about to fall apart. The biggest turnoff was the unclean bathroom. The ventilation was poor and it was stuffy in the bathroom.I chose price over comfort and I did not regret my choice. However, if I visit Seminyak again, I would stay in a better place with a clean bathroom.", "Date": "Oct 9, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR712745526", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Everywheretraveler"}, {"Content": "Want to really feel like your in Bali without 5 star pretentions       view from room to pool area", "Date": "Jul 27, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR984289934", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "sagittarian66"}, {"Content": "Very nice hotel!       2 floor", "Date": "May 30, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR780473020", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Nadusha"}, {"Content": "Pleasant hotel in Seminyak We just got back from three weeks in Bali and started our trip at the PURI CENDANA in Seminyak. It was a half block from the beach and right next door to the upscale Sofitel Hotel. The hotel has about 20 rooms and most are two-story affairs with a sitting room and huge openair bathroom downstairs and an airconditioned sleeping loft upstairs. (Warning: Stairs are very narrow and steep). Breakfast is served in the open-air CinCin restaurant next door. It has a nice pool and lovely well-maintained gardens. This is not what you would call an upscale resort, but we loved the location, the bathrooms were really cool, and the place was spotless.
