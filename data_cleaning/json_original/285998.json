The hotel lobby had a foul odor; apparently the plumbing in this area of Barcelona is quite old. This odor, unfortunately, followed us up to our hotel room and as the vent/fan system is not adjustable in the rooms, we had to call someone to fix this problem. The hotel did adjust the fan, however, the foul smell permeating our room continued on and off throughout our stay, so we needed to keep a window open for air flow. No problem except that the hotel is located in a very busy alley where there is a lot of foot traffic and noise throughout the evening. To add to this problem, our toilet broke, and the hotel was unable to fix it as it was a holiday weekend and had no plumber available. As they had no other rooms available, we had to make due by going into the toilet's tank each time we needed to flush. This is not the way a supposed first rate hotel should operate! WiFi was down for much of our stay as well. The hotel blamed it on the hotel being full to capacity. Really?! The hotel also charged us what added up to approximately $85 per night for an additional bed in the room. I realize this is standard practice in Europe, however, I would hope they would have accommodated us in some way with all the problems we encountered! We couldn't even get complimentary coffee in the morning. When we called room service for ice cream in the evening, the hotel said the machine was not on, so again, they could not accommodate us. The hotel staff was very indifferent and very inexperienced. Had we stayed in a 1 or 2 star hotel, our expectations would have been much different.

I read so much about it online by simply googling for a boutique hotel in the ruins/historic sites...etc then NERI was there, images online were so amazing, and the person I booked through was also really nice & helpful. When we arrived in Barcelona, hotel staff were really helpful to assist us direct our taxi driver to the hotel. Once we got there we simply did the checking in procedures and one of the staff showed us around and took us to our suite, it was really lovely, its exactly my taste in furniture and colors, for my husband it was the opposite effect he didnt like it at all, he expects large bright rooms, but he didnt say anything since he knew I was excited about staying in a vintage historic hotel. we had a tiny terrace u can stand out on it but the area itself isnt what you would expect, facing another building, barely 2 meters away from our hotel, and that was one of things that disturbed us both, is having these strange people in the streets doing noise and even people who are simply talking and passing by you could here everything while you tried to sleep (though the bed itself was amazingly comfortable and I can sleep anywhere if my bed is cozy, clean & fresh with big fluffy pillows) if it werent for the drunk workers outside. We also enjoyed their small bar just downstairs from the back entrance of the hotel, around a small fountain, its really dodgy area though, we were having a bite in the outdoor seating area, and suddenly you see 2 drug dealers exchanging stuff probably & you look around thinking this must be a movie!! How on earth are these people doing these things & its in midday! Well, its not a movie, then police 2 seconds later drive through on their bikes, and the guys act as if they weren't doing anything wrong, but people in the restaurant don't dare to say anything, afraid from those 2 men. So hotel is great but the area even though its behind the cathedral simply steps away, but its full of drug addicts and alcoholics wandering around and its not the Neri\"s problem. We didn't have any complaints about anything cause all was working fine in our suite, other than the safe, its basically a box with a password, its separated from the closet, but its inside, but I wouldn't trust leaving my valuables and going out knowing somebody can simply go in our suite and take the safe out with him/her. But we didn't have any issues thankfully! We didnt have breakfast in the hotel but we had a snack as I mentioned down int heir bar. Other than that, there was plenty of good cafes around. We also asked the hotel staff to advise us whats the best way to go to Sabadell, 30 min out of Barcelona, hoping to meet my wedding dress designer, The staff member he was actually from that area and gladly assisted us and ordered the taxi to take us to our destination. Hotel staff were really nice I dont blame people or a hotel for having bad/noisy neighbors. One more thing, The toiletries are really good and all you need to buy is some toothpaste & deodorant! Take the open bus tour if you go in Spring, buy the 2 day access if you're there for a weekend, its really good and worth it, takes you all around the city, up and down hills & mountains, to the sea and to the poor areas also, its interesting to see all this, you can hop on & off anytime, every 15 min another bus passes by at the same stops, it can get really busy so make sure you get there on time so you guarantee to get a seat on the bus!", "Date": "December 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Munich, Germany", "Title": "\u201cGreat Design and Location\u201d", "Author": "Monius", "ReviewID": "UR120897413", "Content": "The Hotel Neri has a very stylish and charming design!

It's a quaint and tastefully decorated boutique hotel with surprise touches everywhere you go - hot chocolate in the library/lounge, a selection of your favourite music (CD) in your room, custom linen and bedding, an outdoor terrasse just off the Neri Restaurant with a fountain tucked away in the courtyard, spacious bathroom and rooms filled with light and every amenity you could want. If it's not there, you need only ask the friendly and efficient staff. Where else in the old gothic quartier can you find a sensational rooftop terrace with a stunning view overlooking one of the nearby cathedrals...it was a treat after spending the days exploring other parts of the city that were crammed with tourists. I agree with the guest who said that the schoolchildren laughing and playing in the courtyard just added to the wonderful atmosphere and it didn't deter us from the afternoon siesta as we simply closed the window. The guide books don't tell you that this is one of the safest hotel locations in the entire city because of its proximity to nearby government and police offices. The added plus is that almost everything is within 15 minutes walking distance and the Metro system is one of the easiest to navigate on the planet. The Bad: Not much to say here, except that there is ongoing construction just across from the hotel entrance and because of the very narrow streets, construction noise can literally be just across the street (less than 10 feet away) if your room is located on the Calle Sant Sever side. Secondly, I'd strongly recommend going with the hotel transport on your way in. Yes, it's twice as expensive, but well worth it as we actually got a guided tour once we entered the city and found this invaluable since we knew all the major monuments/buildings and never got lost after that. If you chose the airport taxis, you could easily get lost or you'd have to lug your suitcases down cobblestone streets, which is no fun. The hotel was happy to call a regular cab service on our way back to the airport (costs between 30-35 Euro depending on traffic). The Ugly: Can't think of anything to add with regards to this hotel. However, I will share one ugly experience about Barcelona in general. Everyone knows to be on the look-out for pickpockets, and they are rampant (especially in La Boqueria)! but I would like to add that you should stay away from the young locals who are always in the plazas tossing those neon blue spinning tops into the air.

Taxi let us off by the cathedral and had to walk with our luggage to the hotel since the small alley was blocked by a car. It's an easy walk up on street, make a right, and you'd walk right by the front door unless you were looking for it. Initially, I was put off by the small alley and some grafitti, but as you tour Barcelona, you see that grafitti is quite prevalent, but in an artistic kind of way. The hotel was smaller than I expected from viewing the pictures online, but they were true to the images online. There is a desk where check in occurs and they handle one person at a time which makes for a more personal experience. I had to consult with the front desk a few other times and the staff always was pleasant and helpful. Was in room #208 which is a corner room with two windows. One window looked straight into someone's apartment and the other window looked right into the construction project so while we had 2 windows, we kept the curtains closed for privacy. The room was on the smaller side since I picked the a standard room, but there was enough space for two people. Lots of little sundries in the bathroom in case you forgot something. Liked the in-room safe and hair dryer. There is no in-room coffee, but you can order for $7 euro for coffee & milk. Let me share that the room was exceptionally clean. Loved the bathroom with the stone shower and loved the rain shower head. The room had bathrobes and slippers which were handy. Also, the room has an umbrella that we never had to use, but convenient if it rained. We did hear the noise from the construction (hammering, guys talking), but it was very minor and never interefered with our stay. Did not hear any children in the morning so I believe we were on the opposite side of the courtyard. In any case, noise was never an issue for us. In fact, if I were to go to Barcelona again, I'd much prefer a room with a more remote location as Hotel Neri than a stay on the crazy, loud Las Ramblas. Hotels on that street may get higher ratings, but there is too much commotion on that street for my liking. While the Barri Gotic does have odd streets that meander and it's easy to get lost, I found it extremely charming and am so glad I stayed here rather than the Palace which I also had been considering. There are tons of unique shops and very friendly shop owners in this side of town. There are great tapas bars around the corner, major shopping just a few streets away, Las Ramblas is a short 5 minute walk, and Plaza Cataluyna is about 8 minutes away. We walked all over due the central location, but did take a cab to see a flamenco show. When I was ready to board the ship, the hotel called a cab and the cab backed up right to the front door so that made it very easy when we left. Overall, I really enjoyed staying in the old section of town, in an older building, but with modern conveniences and a modern decor.

The bath is a stone floor, with stone walls. We liked it. The room got nicely chilly (we prefer no higher than 65 degrees to sleep), which was a welcome relief from the 90 degree heat of Barcelona and the equaly hot hallways in the hotel. The bed was quite comfortable - maybe too much so, since we ended up sleeping very late the first morning. The other reviewers frequently pointed out the noise from the school kids in the courtyard outside. Normally, when I think of European hotels with a courtyard, I envision a hotel where the rooms facing the street are noisy, but those on the interior are quiet. Not here. Our room had windows on two sides - one looked across into apartments about 10 feet away, while the other fronted onto that damned little courtyard. Who knew you could put several dozen young children in there at 7:30 in the morning and get them all to scream at the top of their lungs? Add to that the sound of construction (I suppose there will always be something under renovation in the quarter), and you had better be planning to get up early. The staff were very pleasant and helpful. We did not sample the restaurant, since the initial offer of breakfast for 19 Euros was simply too high to even consider. We visited the rooftop terrace two nights - once when there was a staffer but no guests, and a second time when there were guests trying to get served, but no one on duty.

Best thing to do is to print a map off as taxis can't get you very close to it. The other tip is that when you do have a map things that look like they are a kilometre away are maybe 250m , makes it a bit hard to get your bearings. Check in was quick , friendly with a quick tour of the restaurant , courtyard area. we had a deluxe room which was clean and quiet (for bcn). Great bathroom. Breakfast , 17euro if you take the promo offer when you check in , was pretty good but not the fantastic like hotel 1898. Check in guy warned us about pick pockets near hotel,,,, we went out for dinner and I took my phone with me ( partner said to leave in room !:(..... when we were coming home a nice (/!) guy asked us for directions.....then a few minutes later i realised my phone was gone. Of course not only was phone gone but we had a little argument about me taking the phone !not sure which was worse :) anyway sh***t happens , my tip is if u do take your phone have a lanyard or something to tie it to your belt and take only enough cash , not wallet cards etc. these guys are expert. another friend and his wife lost phone wallets all in about 1 minute when two very friendly guys asked them for directions, they went aware , like me , that they had even been touched. I wish i had bought a small cheap hand set with me and got a local sim. of course the plan of action is to contact your phone company right away and block phone , also iPhone has a feature , find my iPhone , where you can remotely wipe all contents , you need the app installed on the phone then you are able to do this from any pc after it gets stolen or lost.

When we arrived we checked in and just as we had completed this received a welcome glass of tea - not ideal as we were about to be shown round the hotel and to our room. We had to carry it with us whilst we were shown round the hotel's facilities, though thankfully it was short. Short and not very good; \"this is the library, over there the restaurant and now up in the lift to your room\". We also were also to receive a complimentary bottle of Cava and were asked what time we would like it to be brought to the room. We asked for 5:00pm as it was only just before lunchtime when we arrived. Unfortunately, this did not arrive at 5:00, or quarter past or half past and took 45 minutes despite asking where it was several times with no apology. Why ask if you can't deliver at the agreed time? We also reported a problem within the bathroom the first day, the sink had a leaking pipe which was causing the bathroom floor to fill with water. They sent a maintenance man and one of the men from reception upstairs to have a look - whilst still waiting for the cava - and he told us that we had left the plug in the sink. He told us that doing so meant all the water drained out too fast and thus the overflow on the floor. When we told him we hadn't used the sink yet he told us we were wrong and this is definitely what had happened. We were bemused by their explanation, they went away and promised to bring us more towels to replace the ones used to mop the floor up. They also said they would look at it again the following day whilst we were out to check the pipe. Despite several times reminding them that the pipe was leaking and asking them each morning could somebody please sort it out, when we left the hotel after a four night stay, the floor was still wet through. We had to use all the towels placed in the room each day just to mop the floor. We asked for recommendations for eating and to have restaurant bookings made. Each time we had assurances it would be done and a note would be left in our room to confirm but I'm afraid this didn't happen. We just didn't feel confident anything we asked for would actually occur. On the third night we asked if we could have a booking for the following day at a restaurant recommened on Trip Advisor called Dieux. We asked again the next morning if the booking had been made and, after some scurrying around behind reception, we were told yes the booking had been made. We tried to find the restaurant that afternoon on our way back but couldn't so asked at reception when we came back where was it. We were then told that the restaurant no longer existed but a booking had been made at it's replacement restaurant. We asked if this was a good restaurant to be told by the receptionist, no he had been there and did not think it was very good! We decided to ignore him and carry on with the booking. As it turned out the restaurant wasn't very good on the service side but the food was very good. We also asked for the best way to get to Camp Nou (FC Barcelona). We'd been there via a tourist bus throughout the day to collect some tickets for the match that evening and it was obviously somewhere where you should know how to get to with 82,000 people all wanting to get there. We were advised to get a taxi! When we queried the possibility of traffic and we would prefer the public transport options we were told buses go there (not which ones) and then to go a Metro station further away than the closest one. When we got to the room to check it out there was a Metro on the correct line around the corner from the hotel, the one recommended would not have taken us to the stadium. We ignored their advice. On checking out we were told we had had water from the minibar, which we hadn't, not at euros 7.50 for a small bottle anyway! Again that look of disbelief from the receptionist made us feel very uncomfortable, but he did remove the drinks in the end. Would we recommend this hotel to others? Well the location is excellent for accessibility to shops, restaurants and transport. The hotel is a lovely old building converted to a hotel. Is it as special as people promote it to be? No. Is it worth the price per night? No. The bathroom was dark (and in our case felt damp). There was no fan in the bathroom. The wall mounted light/mirror was falling off the wall, the plaster had given way. The stone around the bath and shower looked nice but was completely impractical and we kept getting grazes from it. The bedroom floors are wooden and look lovely but when you have someone walking in high heels across them above you it's very noisy. The window to the balcony opened inwards and was difficult to negotiate around the furniture in the room. The bedding was nice but nothing special. The towels were not 'big and fluffy' as promoted. The towelling robes felt thin and you felt like many people had been wearing them! Free wi-fi - one of my pet hates here I'm afraid - it's there, it's for free but you need a password and username to get into it which no-one can supply and it's not in the hotel literature to just be able to log on. The decor to the rooms look a little tired and it really shows in places. The solarium was closed and the roof terrace may overlook the Gothic Quarter but you need to go to the edge and look down as from the terrace all you can see is people's rooftops and windows. There were sunloungers but with no covers and we didn't seen any sign of the bar service. Barcelona itself was a surprise to us, we iked it very much.

We loved being steps away from the Cathedral and the Barcelona City Museum.

The service was friendly and professional at the front desk, and when we had questions we found everyone to be very helpful. We did use room service, which was fast and efficient but since our room only had a tiny table suitable for 2 wine glasses we found we needed to use the table from the terrace. Had we been given a choice at check in (I forgot to ask) we would have opted for a larger room instead of the terrace. The front desk also arranged a taxi for us to the airport (door to door) which was only 35\u20ac rather than the \"luxury shuttle\" which was very much appreciated. On the whole the room was comfortable, but very dark unless the drapes were fully open on a sunny morning. A reading light by the chairs would help that. Our bathroom faced apartments across the narrow walkway, and our bathroom window could also be viewed from the square below. Without proper privacy blinds, this was not the \"sensuous\" experience advertised at the Neri but instead was rather disconcerting, particularly at night. We waited to book breakfast upon arrival, as had been previously recommended, since the price was much better than when booking with the room. It was a fabulous breakfast, complete with hot choices like an omelette, and gave us a wonderful start to the day. The only complaint we had is the lounge area of the restaurant, steps away from the breakfast, was used as a smoking area. Perhaps that will change after January 2. We would hope so.

Do not miss entire streets of old Barcino with water and drainage systems, baths,homes, dye works and laundries which lie under the Museu d'Historiain Placa del Rei about 3 Minutes from the Neri hotel.

The service was without fault, in fact they seemed to bend over backwards to be of service to us the entire stay. The best thing about the hotel is the location, which is tucked away on a pedestrian street away from the frenetic energy in the Barcelona streets and it was a relief to come back to our room after a hectic day exploring the city. The room was very comfortable with great linens and bathroom lined with stone tiles that I loved. However, there are a couple of issues which I think are important to know. Firstly, although the hotel is on a nice little square, for every weekday that we were there the sound of children from the school there was really, really loud every day for most of the day. I don't mind some city or kids having fun type of noise, but it was pretty loud and our room was on the far side of the hotel away from the square. The other noise issue was that because of the contemporary decor, most of the surfaces in the hotel are hard (wood, stone, glass) and because there is a large atrium open between floors, there is noise from the other heavy wooden doors closing. It didn't ruin my stay, but it was loud. Another thing to be aware of is that we stayed in a Junior Suite, which was a really nice room but which was basically just a large room and in no way a suite. There was no separate area or bedroom, so calling it a suite is not accurate. There were two chairs and tiny end table in between, plus the bed. In fact, the closet storage was smallish and for a couple staying for a while with a lot of clothes or luggage, it would be a tight squeeze. I've experienced this before in Spanish hotels so I wasn't overly surprised, but I would've liked to know it in advance because I love a separate bedroom when we travel. I still enjoyed the room and liked the private deck, which was spacious if not private because of neighboring windows overlooking it. There were also a few small issues that I think a hotel of this caliber should not overlook, like peeling paint in the shower, as well as a shower fixture with a sprayer that would not turn off and sprayed all over during the shower.", "Date": "June 19, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Surrey", "Title": "\u201cNeri - ok but noisy!\u201d", "Author": "FlopsySurrey", "ReviewID": "UR27078425", "Content": "Our stay at the Neri was a 40th birthday treat.

A few days before you arrive at Neri, you'll receive an e-mail asking you for your preferences with pillow types (feather, foam, sponge, brick?) and sheet types (linen, cotton, satin), as well as if you need a transfer service from the airport (Neri's transfer service would be 50 Euros; a regular Barcelona taxi would be about 25 Euros, but you run the risk of the driver not knowing precisely where Neri or Sant Server street is, in which case you tell him Pla\u00e7a de Sant Jaume). Thankfully our driver knew where Sant Server street was and after dropping us off in the square, we walked up one street, made a left onto Sant Server (no sane driver should attempt to drive up Sant Server street, it's too narrow) and the hotel was right there. The first thing you might walk into when entering the building will be an aromatherapy wall. It's strong! When you sit at the reception desk, the receptionist will have welcome drinks (\"sweet milk\", as in coconut milk?) brought out. The check-in process was very individualized and pleasant. Because the hotel was fully booked for the nights were there, the receptionist said we received an \"upgrade\" (we originally booked a deluxe room) to a Junior Suite. From what I can tell, the sizes between the three different room types are really really close, the only difference might be that there's a few extra amenities from one room type to another, and our junior suite had an outside balcony with chairs, a table and a day bed. Not worth the difference in price, in my opinion. For example, the suite balcony would probably be most pleasant to use when the sun is going down or especially when the weather isn't blazing hot outside, but the table there is not even big or tall enough to properly balance a room service tray or more than a couple small plates. Apparently the hotel is a renovated, centuries old mansion, but every single centimeter of the building seemed completely brand new and I couldn't find what I thought was an original brick or tile in the place. When I stepped out onto the suite's balcony and looked at the overhanging roof, I recognized those as being somewhat aged. Okay -- the renovation they did to the original building must've been incredibly thorough. For it's size, the room was very impressive, thoughtful, quiet and indeed very soothing. Your keycard needs to be inserted into a slot near the door in order for the room's lights & A/C to turn on. Tiny halogen lights on each side of our bed could be dimmed and controlled from either side. I liked the very slight \"rustic\" feel to the furniture. Entering the bathroom, our room had an immense mirror with lights behind it. Other light switches turn on a heat lamp and a much brighter light. The shower was encompassed on three sides by rock slabs and a full glass wall (no worries about spilling water all over the floor like in other European hotel bathrooms with puny glass panels only covering a little bit of a tub). Two little bags on the sink contain pretty much anything you forgot to bring from home: toothbrush & paste, comb, tissues, shower cap, makeup remover wipes, cotton buds & cotton puffs, razor & shaving creme. There's lotion, shampoo and \"bath foam\" (shower gel, I guess... no bathtubs in this hotel) bottles as well. Now a couple of unfortunate things. The last night of our stay, we noticed tiny black bugs in our bed. They were about the size of fleas but they didn't jump like fleas. Nor did they bite. I'm not sure what attracted them or what they were, but it added a wee bit of an \"ick\" factor to the stay. There is an incense burner with incense on a shelf next to the bed. After I burned some incense the first night, housekeeping never swept up the ashes from the shelf that I probably should've cleaned up myself. I still tipped the housekeeping staff, tho. My wife wanted to try the restaurant for dinner but once we got a look at the menu on site, she said there appeared to be more menu items listed on the hotel's website than in the actual restaurant menu (it appeared that there were maybe four things listed under each category of \"fish\", \"meat\", \"starters\"). Nothing in the English menu sounded very appetizing, so we ended up not indulging with dinner at the hotel restaurant. We did do a room service \"snack\" two nights (in place of dinner). The Ham, Cheese & Asparagus sandwich was small but very delicious, and my wife very much liked the Boccanipio (sp?) cheese and dried tomato salad. My next night's choice turned out a little strange because of an unfortunate English translation in the menu. It listed \"tacos of bullock with potato foam\", but the actual item turned out to be beef skewers in a kind of potato soup. Relatively tasty, but I would've chose differently had there been an accurate description. Other reviewers note surly service. I didn't get this perception at all. Most every staff member I talked with seemed pretty friendly and helpful. Only a couple requests got ignored or denied (e.g. we had to check out at 12 noon sharp, not 12:30 p.m.), but nothing too important or annoying. As we left the hotel, we noticed that graffiti taggers had \"hit\" the Hotel Neri window on Sant Server street, as well as spray painting lots of other doors & buildings along the way back to the plaza.

Some of the furniture even looked like it had been knocked together at ikea! On a plus point the bed was huge and very comfy. The bathroom was on the small side and for the price and style of hotel we would have expected a walk in shower - not a badly designed shower over a spongy bath that leaked onto the floor. As advertised in the room we decided to have a drink on the roof terrace. Orders had to be placed by telephone, there was no menu and the staff taking the call were very unhelpful. The waitress who brought the drinks up was very unfriendly as if she resented having to bring drinks to the fourth floor! The electricity kept going off in our room and we had to ring reception to have it switched back on.

We booked a Junior Suite for two nights and chose Neri over Arts, due to its proximity to the New Year celebrations and after reading the reviews on Tripadvisor. The majority of reviews are accurate when discussing the location (which is excellent) and the decor/ambiance (which, again, was very pleasant). The rooms are well designed. They are rather more modern than the surroundings of the Gothic quarter, but we knew that. Comfortable beds and a stylish bathroom created a relaxing environment. So what was the problem? Well, for a four star hotel that charges me EUR 332 for a night, I expect a lot more. It was difficult for us not to compare with Santa Mauro in Madrid, where we had stayed a month before, for the same price and which oozed efficiency and courtesy. Neri was nothing on this, or indeed many other hotels we have stayed in (particularly those that charge the same prices). We arrived at 23.30 after a late flight from London. The hotel knew that this would be our arrival time (and as it was Friday evening, I would imagine the hotel has had experience of many people taking a flight after work to spend the weekend in Barcelona). There was one person manning the front desk and no other staff (whether porter or receptionist or indeed anybody else) were available. And so, we were not shown to our room, and carried our own bags there. We were not shown how to operate the TV or the Aircon or shown where the well-hidden mini bar was (we now know) or even offered a newspaper for the following morning or told that we could order breakfast for our room by filling in a form and placing it on the door. As a perennial back-pain sufferer, I was pleased to see I could get a firm pillow, but displeased to find out that I could not do so after 9pm as house-keeping was closed (despite the information in our room proudly advertising the fact that a range of pillows was available)! Then we found out the TV didn't actually work. The next day, when we mentioned all of this to the supervisor, she could not have looked more disinterested or acted more discourteously if she tried (the manager was only available from Monday - Friday, and was not around at weekends. This was a shame, for Barcelona is a wonderful city, the hotel is a fabulous building in an excellent location and the staff (with the exception of the supervisor) were very friendly and welcoming, although rather stretched.

The hotel staff in particular was fabulous and extremely patient and gracious--making reservations, assisting with a scavenger hunt, and helping individuals on matters like internet access, finding our tour bus driver for a wine tour, arranging taxi's for large groups, a wine party in the library, and taking group photos. We couldn\u2019t have been happier and will always choose this hotel in Barcelona.", "Date": "September 20, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston", "Title": "\u201cBeware\u201d", "Author": "EmilieV7", "ReviewID": "UR3840264", "Content": "We would be writing a review of this hotel had they not TOTALLY screwed up our reservations for two rooms. The only way we discovered this error was by dropping by the Neri 2 weeks before our planned visit (we were staying at the wonderful Casa Camper in July 2005) and having been urged to also try the Neri by friends in Barcelona we had made reservations there for our return to Barcelona in early August. In any event, during our little visit to the Neri we were told that they had lost our reservations despite the fact that we had the confirming emails with us and had exchanged multiple emails with the staff. The most appalling thing was that the hotel offered us nothing! Not even an apology. They just said: sorry we're full and don't know how this happened.... This does make one wonder about this hotel. We returned in August 05 instead to the Casa Camper which we love and can highly recommend.", "Date": "September 3, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cheshire England", "Title": "\u201cA few missing facts -\u201d", "Author": "MarionMontgomery", "ReviewID": "UR3807407", "Content": "I'll not repeat the majority of what has been said, its a great place and without any doubt better than any other hotel in Barca. Ideal for romantics but NOT under 12's, even though they will add an extra bed for 50Euros a night. Just a few \"adds\". It is VERY VERY difficult to locate, we were there for 2 nights and got lost every time we ventured out - and even the owner of the bar in the next alley way didn't know where they were!!! Book a superior room - they have a safe + they face the square and not the adjacent apartments. Don't expect a scenic view from any window though! Breakfast is expensive at 18Euros ...BUT...like the place itself its an experience, don't miss it out! Barca is, contrary to popular opinion, a safe place if you take care and be sensible. Sadly the square behind the hotel is very peaceful, so it attracts some vagrants, we counted 5 one evening- who enjoy the delights of sleeping on cardboard in the corners. They aren't agressive, they just want to sleep- but it does take the gloss off you enjoying the opulence from within- guilt maybe?????? They can't get rid of them as the police say they aren't breaking the law. Restaurants start serving at 9pm onwards- plenty to choose from. PLA, which is just around the corner from Neri is ideal if you don't want to walk too far- good food as well. The Neri is not cheap - but for a short stay its well worth it. Not just a place to stay but an experience - much enhanced if you like the smell of joss sticks , being attended to by \"beautiful people\" and appreciate detail - such as the condoms in the mini bar - honest!!! :)", "Date": "August 25, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Valencia, CA", "Title": "\u201cGreat boutique hotel\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3728393", "Content": "2 nights at the Neri proved to be a fabulous choice!

Especially great for an American used to American hotels and shocked by European room sizes and styles. The front desk operates as concierge desk and everyone wears multiple hats at this property.

In arrival in the early morning our room was not ready, and we were shown to a library/salon to wait and given complimentary drinks by the friendly and helpful staff. The hotel is in the old town and is a small boutique style venue. Our room had a high vaulted ceiling, was spacious and beautifully furnished, completed with plasma tv and cd player. The fantastic bathroom was unusual and stylish with slate floor and tiling. We enjoyed a gorgeous breakfast in bed - the food was pricey but delicious.

This part of town is a maze of dark alleys and atmospheric little squares. It is mostly pedestrianised so one will have to walk the last 200m to the hotel. The hotel itself is set in an old building about 50m from the cloister entrance of Barcelona\u2019s gothic Cathedral. The surrounding streets contain every sort of bar, restaurant and caf\u00e9 imaginable. Its location makes the hotel a good base to explore Barcelona from. All the main sights are in walking distance and walking is the way to see this city. The hotel is dark, calm, stony and all shades of grey. The overall effect was in harmony with the part of town it resides in. Staying in this hotel (during a sunny February) really coloured our view of the town. If one was to stay at, say, the Hotel Arts, you would likely end up seeing Barcelona as a hip, vibrant, modern, squeaky clean, bright town. From the Gothic quarter, Barcelona seems much more complex and the fantastic modernista buildings seem slightly menacing. Gaudi\u2019s buildings in particular look less like playground confections and more like the work of genius. The hotel was very quiet when we were there but the nature of the area is such that nightlife may well be audible in your room. It only has 22 rooms so the place never seemed crowded. Beds were huge and comfortable. Bathrooms were original and good (but no separate shower). No tea and coffee making facilities in the room (thank god) but there was a very well stocked mini bar. Everything was spotlessly clean and everything worked. The hotel has a small roof terrace where one can catch the sun while listening to the thrum of the town around you and the shouts from the local nursery playground across a square. All in all \u2013 recommended.

We ended up with a room that was by the school so unfortunately we did hear the kids in the early morning, but it wasnt so bad.
