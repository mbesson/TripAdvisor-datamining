Just 5 mins' walk from Las Ramblas and Pl.Catalunya, from where we could branch out anywhere by Metro or by bus. Having read some earlier reviews about how some people arrived to find no record of their reservations (though that was for Ramblas I or II, not Ramblas III), we took the precaution of calling them up a week before our arrival to check on our reservations. We were a group of 14, and took a 3-br unit for 8 pax and a 2-br unit for 6 pax. They confirmed both our reservations were intact. A few days before check-in, we received an e-mail reminding us that check-in was at C.Pau Claris, a different location from the apartments. We found the apartments surprisingly spacious for such a central location. Usually, the more central, the smaller the space simply because space would be a premium, right? Besides reasonably spacious bedrooms (where we could leave our big bags opened on the floor and still have space left to walk!), spacious living room with 2 sofas (1 of which could be opened up to become a sofabed) with a dining table, there was also a spacious kitchen with another table for dining. The central location meant we could go out for the day, return to the apartment for a rest and then go out again for dinner or shopping. The only dampener is that one had to check-in at a different location (1 Metro stop or 15 mins' walk from Pl.Catalunya) - imagine having just arrived in the city (i.e. total strangers to the city) laden with luggage and then having to look first for the check-in premises and then for the apartment itself. For my group, we had loads of people and luggage, so we took the easy way out by calling a taxi. The airport info counter furnished us with a list of numbers to call for taxis and we took two 7-seater vans. The drivers first drove us to Pau Claris for check-in, waited whilst 2 of us went into the building to attend to the check-in and after that, drove us to the apartments. The cost was not that high (55 Euros incl. tips, per car), divided by 14 of us, but it might be rather costly if there were only 1 or 2 of you. But hassle aside, the check-in staff at Pau Claris was great - Vicky who attended to us spoke fluent English and was most courteous and helpful. One further puzzling thing was : Both our apartments had washing machines. Those of us in the 3-br unit happily washed our dirty clothes in it but the machine in the other unit didn't work, so we called Pau Claris to report to them. We were told that we were not supposed to use the washing machine! Apparently they were only for the use of the housekeeping people to wash the linens, and that \"washing machine\" was not listed in the list of amenities for the Apartments (I didn't notice!). Anyway, I would strongly suggest to the owner to include this in the apartment! There was no dryer so I had to send out SOS to Tripadvisor forummers to ask where the nearest laundry was - within a short span of time, I'd been given directions to the nearest one 3 mins' walk away!! Thanks folks!! Tip : When you check in at C.Pau Claris, they give you lots of discount vouchers, in a booklet - lots of great discounts! For the hop-on hop off Bus Turistic, they also gave a separate voucher for 6 Euros discount. This is very good - other vouchers typically give only 10% discount but here we got 6Euros discount (approx 25%). Please ask them to give you 1 discount booklet and 1 Bus Turistic voucher for EACH member of your group, as most of the vouchers are only valid for 1 person. In our case, there were 14 of us but they only gave us 4 or 5 booklets. By the time we went through the booklets and realised we needed 14 booklets, we had to go back to C.Pau Claris to collect more booklets. Their staff there was most obliging and immediately said \"Of course\" when we called up to enquire if we could be given 1 booklet for each pax in our group - however, it have been better if they'd given that no. of booklets to us upon check-in!", "Date": "December 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Calexico, California", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Place, price and location\u201d", "Author": "Juan L", "ReviewID": "UR121456654", "Content": "Great location, not expensive at all, nice staff.

Our appartment had three double bedrooms all with air conditioning, two bathrooms with toilet, bidet and baths with showers. The living area was spacious with a dining table and one sofa, the tv was a little outdated with a small stereo to play music. The kitchen was ok but a bit run down with broken tiles on the floor. The appartment was in need of a little overhall as it was starting to look a bit run down, the safe went on the blink which became frustrating. We got a taxi from the airport to the b&b in town to collect the keys for the appartment which was a little inconvenient as it was about a 15 minute walk from the b&b to the appartment.

Las Ramblas Appartments III has a great location at the city center only 2 blocks away from the main square Placa Catalunya and Las Rambla. The metro station Urquinaona is just 50 steps away and Palace of Catalan Music is around the corner. The Boqueria Market is 5-7 minutes walking distance from the appartment and kitchen has everything needed for cooking. We enjoyed making dinner of fresh fish and vegetables. Everything in the apartment was just as we expected except of that there were no cold water in kitchen and shower curtain was missing. But we were so excited about the city and had so much fun that never called or visited manager. I'm quite sure that if we did, they could fix it immidiately - the desk stuff seemed to be friendly and helpful.

We planned this trip on a tight budget and really only wanted somewhere to lay our heads. Prior to travel I read several bad reviews of the Las Ramblas...and to be honest was a little put off and expected the worse. I can honestly say that we were all very happy when we arrived...It's a Spacious appt with 2 rooms containing 2 single beds with en suit access and double bed, again with en -suit access and then a double sofa bed in the main living space. There is a fully functional kitchen with fridge and cooking & dining facilities...along with enough towels for all (8 People) and a working TV and Hi-FI. The location of the appts is great...it's central, 5 mins walk to the main Ramblas street and the Metro is right out side. You do have to go 6 blocks up the road to collect the keys and to be honest if i'd know a little earlier that the day before I'd have included the metro stop up in my hand outs so i didn't have to walk...Although we did discover a pretty small but cool bar serving Van Domm (I think) i nice local bitter (beir) I would certainly recommend this to anyone and with Barcelona being such an expensive city (4.90 Euro for Guinness in small Irish Bars, 6 Euro in centrally located bars) If you travel light and want a great value for money stay in an expensive city...This has to be your place!
