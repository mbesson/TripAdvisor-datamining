Sorry, but I don't think it is a good place to stay in and have a leisure... I believe it is a stinking place in garden as Istanbul is very nice and wonderful city but the hotel is dirty and you smell the bad smell of the carpet humidity which has never been replaced since the hotel opened as I believe... I got the reservation from airport and they gave me a great idea and cheated me actually while this place should be taken out of Istanbul and get rid of it...

Istanbul is a very expensive place for hotels with mostly small rooms and busy streets. The Pianoforte is in the Fathi district very busy but safe. This hotel has reasonable rooms in reasonable condition and is reasonably clean. The staff are friendly and for \u00c2\u00a325 per night is absolutely amazing value for Istanbul. The people who are complaining about this and that with the hotel must have strange expectations of a hotel this cheap.
