We made a late booking and basically this was the only place available close to family we were visiting. Yes it was basic but I thought what do you expect and the bed sheets etc looked presentable. It was noisy most nights BUT on the last night around 11.30, the room next door erupted with the noise of four young men who sounded high on something, the language and shouting were way past tolerable, they had brought a woman to the room for obvious purposes.. At this point (12.15) my husband went down to the front desk, the night porter told him that 2 had checked in and the others were guests, he seemed genuinely frightened of this gang and we advised to call the Police. He did call to the room and tell them to leave. At 1.15am my husband saw 4 young men leaving the room, one had a scarf covering his face, another had his hat pulled down, one was over 6foot and obviously not the type you would confront. I heard them saying they were going to use the side door to get back in, I was genuinely terrified, to the extent I barricaded our door with the heavy suitcases, believe me I sensed the potential to go very wrong. The next morning the Manager shrugged his shoulders and said \"This is bad luck, no money back but 1 nights stay free another time\" ha as if ever.", "Date": "July 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Nottingham, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cDon't believe their Home Page\u201d", "Author": "ednabook", "ReviewID": "UR114949965", "Content": "I stayed there for 2 nights while working at Brent Cross Shopping Centre. I have to be honest and admit that after driving from Nottingham, working all day then going straight from work for a meal & refreshments, when i checked in and went to my room all i wanted was to sleep so didn't pay much attention to the room. It wasn't until the following morning that it became apparent how poor the room was. The bathroom was tiny 8' x 3' (approx & i think i am being generous here) One needed to be a contortionist to use the toilet, reversing in in a squatting position to land correctly avoiding the sink. The shower sprayed the bathroom while leaving the body below dry while the shower curtain clung to ones back like batmans cape. No plug in the sink. No curtain at the bathroom window. The sleeping area was, like the bathroom, only fit for a 5' contortionist. To get into bed one had to stoop to avoid the sloping pitched roof and lying down was the only way to watch the 14\" antique portable tv, the like of which can normally only be seen in skips, which was on the 24\" high table at the foot of the bed thus requiring the viewer to lay prostate with 2 pillows behind ones head and feet like the hands of a clock at 14.50 to see the screen, no remote control (probably not invented when this tv was made) If one preffered black tea or coffee then you would be happy, i like milk in my coffee so couldn't have a drink as there was none. The bed was comfy, i slept like a log the first night though this was probably more to do with exhaustion and alcohol, i also slept well the second night with less alcohol in my blood so i can say the bed was ok. I would have complained but as i was only there 2 nights simply couldnt be bothered also it was Wimbledon fortnight and everywhere was v busy and priced accordingly. The smoke alarm was broken it was just the base unit with wires hanging from it so i assume this was a smoking allowed room !", "Date": "July 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Verona, Italy", "Title": "\u201cThe worst place I've have ever been!!!\u201d", "Author": "GiovanaH", "ReviewID": "UR79203834", "Content": "The worts Hotel I have ever been.

We arrived at the hotel They could not find the key to the room and we had to wait for an hour until the young girl found it. Then we found that we had been given a twin bedded room instead of a double room. This room was rather dingy and not very clean. It seemed otherwise adequate for the reduced price due to their error and we agreed to remain for the 2 nights. However, we then discovered that there were baby cockroaches in the bathroom and in our bed. We showed the night manager who did not apologise or offer another room or ...... he treated us as though we were a nuisance. Then we noticed the wires loose in the bathroom and one bedside light was broken and they couldn't fix it. We of course mentioned this to the receptionist who again treated us as though we were complaining about nothing. The television in the room did not work on a regular basis, it had a booster which did not work. We stayed the second night thinking that things could'nt get worse but... we were wrong. The second night was a complete disaster! we were woken up at about 2 am by a lunatic in the room next door who threw out his heater into the corridor thus blocking the passage (we have a witness for this event) and then started walking up and down his room and slamming doors in his room, and what sounded like hitting the wall between our rooms. We again called the night receptionist who came up and listened but of course, the person pretended to be asleep so that the receptionis treated us as though we were crazy, this carried on until 4.30 am. By this time we were totally demented, shocked by the treatment meted out to us by the receptionist. In the morning we realised that apart from all that my wife had been eaten alive by fleas! We packed and got ready to leave the hotel but stopped at the reception to hand in the key. We were accosted by the lunatic from the room next door complaining that we had kept him awake! The day Receptionist (who has allegedly worked there for 15 years) told us to leave the hotel as we were a nuisance! She backed this lunatic and told us that we had not stopped complaining since we arrived.
