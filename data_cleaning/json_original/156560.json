In general we liked the place, but it had a few downsides as well. Pros: - Location: only 6 blocks from the train that takes you to YVR airport. It is centrally located, with downtown Vancouver, grocery stores (Safeway and Whole Foods), restaurants, internet caf\u00e9s, Stanley Park, bicycle rental places etc. all located within walking distance - Spacious apartment. - Beautiful view of the city and the mountains. We had asked for a room with a view to the north on a higher floor, and got one, which gave beautiful views both at day and at night. The balcony is a nice extra. - The price: it was the cheapest hotel in the downtown area, plus because it has a kitchen, we saved even more money by not having to eat out every night, as Vancouver is an expensive city. - Despite being in downtown Vancouver, it was quiet in the apartment. Cons: - The hotel seemed like it had been renovated a few years ago (maybe for the Olympics?), and since then not much has been done for maintenance. For example the \u2018Hotel\u2019-sign only had \u2018Ho\u2019 lit up at night, there were stains in the curtains, the kitchen was not very clean (we had to do dishes before we were able to use them, as there was still dirt from previous users on them), the elevator did not respond to \u2018door close\u2019, etc. Nothing was in an unacceptable condition, also we didn\u2019t see any bugs, but I wonder whether the hotel would get the 3.5 star rating as it has been rated by if it would be rated nowadays. - The hotel room was pretty cold. When we asked the receptionist, we got a space heater, but that only helped a little. In general we had a pleasant stay at the hotel, and some of the comments here on Tripadvisor we could not relate to at all: for example the windows did have shades (7th floor) even during the day it was pretty dark in the room.

Both my travel friend (from Germany) and myself (from Australia) found it to be clean and comfortable. All comments about the attitude of front desk staff were correct - except that when I started asking him about HIS day had been, suddenly the abuptness turned into helpfulness and a welcoming smile whenever we came through the front door. The summer past was fantastic weather so air con would have been nice, but with a balcony and windows in both the bedroom and living /dining areas there was always a breeze you could shift a chair to catch. As noted by others the furnishings are old, but nothing was broken in either of the suites we used. The free internet connection in the room was very welcome. The rooms were kept very clean (although like others we had long waits for the rooms to be ready) and the cleaning staff were very helpful with proving an extra towel or tea towel. Location is perfect - especially for walkers. But with a bus stop meters from the door, and the frequent service it was a good location for everyone. And Vancouver buses are accessible, courteous and even in the pre-Olympics building diversions safe & convenient. This hotel and the self catering kitchen and ample cheap take-aways nearby (sushi, fish & chips, Korean, Chinese, Greek) made it a very reasonable stay. Starbucks and Blenz are close as are Safeway & a gourmet market (name?) by Whole Foods. One note on laundry - it was often not available until late afternoon as the cleaning staff are using it to do the sheets and towels as they clean. I found a laundrromat down on Denman Street about 2 1/2 blocks from Robson - up on the first floor that was cheaper and available from very early until very late, and a bit cheaper overall.

Since it was our first time in Canada, I mailed the hotel directly to ask for directions to the hotel from the Amtrak train station- the Pacific Central Station. And, I got no replies. I managed to get there, luckily, hopping on the Bus #5, which dropped us off, about 10 steps away from the hotel. So, I got there safely, but tired from the trip. And an unpleasant welcome at the reception desk was the last thing I needed. A man was checking-in before me, so I waited for my turn, while the man listened to the Spanish? hotel guy complain about whatever he was having problems with. When it was finally my turn, I smiled and said hi, but all I got in return was a frown and a quick 'hi'. Unlike the friendliness the man before me got, I was just given a room key on the counter, and he said,\" Room 704. Bye.\" Maybe he was having a bad day, but I sure didn't deserve that attitude as a guest... But putting all those behind, we went to our room, hoping to hop on the bed to stretch and relax. We open our room door and enter, only to find the bed a whole mess with lots of hair from the visitor before us. We check the bathroom, only to find disappointment and disgust that the sink is filled with hair, and the towels all over the bathroom floor. There was a cup on the kitchen counter- obviously used. Garbage was found here and there on the carpeted living room as well. I hurried down to the guy to tell him that he gave us the wrong room- its a mess!! In reply, he looks up at me, no smile, no expression, and said, \"Check-in is at 4. Room is probably not ready yet. Just leave your things in the room, no problem.\" and goes back to his computer, as if the dirty room was normal. If he gave us the room to be nice before check-in time, thank you. But he could've at least told us that the room is not made yet, but we can leave our belongings in the room. Just a simple short sentence to prepare us for what we're going to see.. When we re-entered the room after 4, we found the room tidy, bed made, and towels changed. But after all that, nothing felt clean anymore. Not to mention that the towel still had some hair on it, and it was a well-used towel. Nothing like the crisp, fresh, clean towels you get at hotels. The garbage was still on the floor, right where I found them in the beginning, and the used cup was still on the kitchen counter, also where I've last seen it. Had it not been for the Capers/ Wholefoods store just a block and a half away, the fully-equipped kitchen, and being in the center of everything, we probably would have left. Our stay comes with more surprises, when our swipe card key to our room apparently 'expired' on the second day, although I reserved to stay at the hotel for 2 nights. Luckily, we didn't have to change rooms, but did we feel very welcomed...The room was made the second night, towels changed, but the sheets weren't changed- just made it look tidy. To use the laundry, we have to receive another swipe card to get into the laundry room- be prepared with lots of quarters! At check-out, we were about to complain about our stay, only to find the same guy that checked us in! And he was nasty to me all the way till the end. He told me to sign, but as I was checking the hotel fee, it was higher than what I booked it for. I got out my print-out, and started to check the breakdown, when he said, \"Just sign it, ok\". That got more suspicious, and I found out the my rate for the first night was higher. When confronted, he got really angry, and circled the hotel rate, underlined the tax for the ngiht, and slammed the pen down on the counter. Angrily, he told me to complain to the government if I had complaints, and that everyone has to pay taxes. Duh, like I don't know anything about taxes. I was talking about the actual room rate, but he kept on telling me to go complain to the government. Besides these, all other hotel staff were helpful, and very friendly. Location was excellent- Bus#5 runs down Robson frequently, internet cafes 2 doors down, and a block away, Bus#19 that takes you into Stanley park is 2 blocks down behidn the hotel, safe area with people walking outside at night as well, lots of places to eat and grab a coffee in walking distance.", "Date": "September 25, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hertfordshire, UK", "Title": "\u201cGreat budget hotel in Vancouver\u201d", "Author": "HertsTraveller081", "ReviewID": "UR19397480", "Content": "Stayed here in early August after recommendations from a friend who lives in Vancouver (and is a Lonely Planet author as well) and was very impressed with it.

It was quite noisy in the room with the sound of cars and buses passing by and car alarms going off specially with the window and sliding door open. The bathroom looks newly remodelled with cheap fixtures. The room needs a major overhaul. The room is spacious. We had a one bedroom suite but I would not call it a suite. The furniture, sofabed and bed needs replacing. Looks like they were acquired in the 1970's. The old curtains had a tear, the thin bedsheet also was torn and had a big hole. There is a kitchenette with a refrigerator, stove/oven and dishes. No microwave! The hotel did not provide paper towels for us to use, just 2 dish towels. We used the dishes for breakfast and left them on the sink. To our amazement, the maid did not wash them. However, what they did was place the dish soap, dirty sponge that looks like it was used to clean car tires next to the sink.
