Really liked the decor. It was really nice having breakfast provided, but the staff's personality was severely lacking. They weren't rude, but always quite aloof and disinterested when interacting with them. The males almost acted as if you were bothering them. One night, I waited 15 minutes for a male staffer to get off the phone, as I needed assistance. I came and stood by him several times and mouthed that I needed help and he just ignored me and laughed and chatted. The only exception was Ana, who pointed out maps and offered her assistance with any needs. She was the only one to do so. It's really too bad they don't have better staff (The women were fine. The men....meh.) because it's a cute hotel on a quiet side street. I'd give pluses across the board if the staff was nicer or at least a little helpful. The hotel is just off a main street in a great location for 10 minute walks to a LOT of the main sites. It also is 5 minutes walk fro two Piazzas which are filled with restaurants.", "Date": "March 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dublin, Ireland", "Title": "\u201cideal hotel\u201d", "Author": "ballyp", "ReviewID": "UR124581335", "Content": "I recently stayed here with my mother and we found the hotel to be a great find.

The room was a very ample size, and the bathroom was a good size for Italy. They are a rather new hotel and are still working on issues like consistent hot water and the drain in the shower flowing fast enough, but over-all we had a very good experience here. The room was very clean when we arrived, and they straightened the room every day, but they didn't clean or change the sheets everyday. I wouldn't have expected it every day, but at least once during a four night stay would have been nice. That said, we really enjoyed our stay and would stay there again. The breakfast was excellent -- by far the best meal of the day except one night. The location is perfect. Campo de' Fiori is a charming neighborhood the we fell in love with. Interesting shops, fun bars and cafes, and friendly locals. The hotel is a four minute walk to Piazza Navona, twenty minute walk to the Colosseum, and maybe 30 minutes to the Spanish Steps.

We informed the front desk and were quickly switched to a much bigger, ant-free room on the 2nd floor at no extra cost. It wasn't an issue of the room being unclean, just a problem with the balcony door in that particular room. Other than that, our stay was great.

I went to this hotel with my fiancee and we had an amazing time. Rome was a place that I always wanted to go to and I must say that both Rome and the hotel far exceeded my expectation. The receptionist was welcoming and informed us of where to go while in Rome, also providing us with a map with all the landmarks. They were always smiling and were always there to answer our questions. The complimentary breakfast was DELICIOUS. There was eggs, cereal, different kinds of pastries, yogurts, coffee, tea, juice, etc. There was everything you needed to eat a hearty breakfast, you had many different choices for breakfast and everything was fresh and delicious. The location of the hotel was PERFECT, it was walking distance to all the famous landmarks, so I was really happy because I could always come back to the hotel in the afternoon to freshen up, rest and go back out again. The hotel room was VERY spacious, clean and updated, the bathroom was amazing, the shower INCREDIBLE.

The breakfast was substantial although we usually slept in and skipped it. The location was very central, we walked everywhere from Ancient Rome, Vatican City, Pantheon, North Rome, Trastavere, etc. Nothing was more than 1 mile or so. They have a computer and nice lounge by the check-in desk. Also, the street was relatively quiet with the window closed. We stayed in 2 different rooms and both had a window that opened onto the small street out front. Our second room had 2 double doors that opened to the outside with a beautiful view of a church down the street. We switched rooms because they did not have 2 twin beds available the first night, but the double bed was large enough for us to sleep comfortably.

However, due to a broken USAir aircraft, we were unable to make it. I contacted the hotel as soon as humanly possible (twice before the plane was canceled and twice after it was canceled), but they still refused to return all or part of our prepaid lodging. So, my review is not of the quality of the hotel or its location, but rather on their business practices. It is typical in the travel and lodging industry to recognize circumstances beyond the travellers control and to refund the money. In this case, this hotel is representative of what we hear of hotels in Rome, don't trust them to do the right thing. If you are not in complete control of your travel modes, then don't book here. I even told them that I picked them based on their reviews on this website and that I always provide a review. It didn\u2019t help!!! Beware, they will screw you!
