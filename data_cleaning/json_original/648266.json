My wife and I recently had the pleasure of staying here for 5 nights and were delighted with both the hotel and location as nothing is that far away and the vaporetto stop is virtually outside the hotel. We received a warm welcome from the reception team and had a lovely room 406 on the 4th floor with views over the rooftops of Venice, the room was of a very good size and well furnished, it was also extremely clean and everything was well maintained. The breakfast was very good and the staff were excellent and could not do enough for you, a glass or two of prosecco before heading out in the morning was a great way to start the day, the reception team were also very helpful recommending things to do, places to see and restaurants and taking the time to mark everything on the essential maps as it is very easy to get lost in Venice. There is absolutely nothing negative to say about this hotel and we would stay again, I would recommend it to anyone that enjoys luxury, refined and elegant service and some of the most helpful and friendly staff you will ever meet. I also recommend taking the speedboat from the airport directly to the hotel, it really is the only way to arrive and worth the cost.

This was a special trip for a special birthday and the hotel had been recommended by a friend influential in the travel trade so we had high expectations. Enough said. This hotel disappointed from start to finish. Our arrival was dealt with curtly. The front desk was generally poor, apart from one excellent girl,.There were odd incidents of porters/management being not just ineffectual but comically ill-mannered - more Fawlty Towers than 5 star! Food took hours in the dining room and then the order was wrong. Waiters, though pleasant, served across you. Breakfast was inadequate - juice not freshly squeezed and eggs, eg omelettes, only cooked freshly for you if you paid a large supplement. The 'music room' next door had piped musak. What about Vivaldi or other classical Venetian composers? The manager, who was unavailable throughout our stay, despite our requests, failed to address our concerns even afterwards yet thought she had done so. There were many niggles. Bathroom was small with poor ventilation - the mirror was frequently steamed up.. Airconditioning control was inadequate as apparently centrally controlled. We asked for a blanket as we were cold but were asleep by the time it arrived. Storage and wardrobe space were totally inadequate - ok for one briefly perhaps, but for two for a few days?? I could go on ad infinitum.

This normally leads to disappointment - but not in this case. The hotel, staff and our room led to a really fantastic weekend. Much is made on trip advisor of the hotel being an ancient monument and it is - but you were made to feel at home in its amazing public rooms, where magazines, newspapers and complimentary drinks made it clear that you were welcome to stay and enjoy the rooms. On arrival, reception was more efficient than welcoming, but we were seen to our room by a very friendly, jovial porter. Our room was on the third floor and was a comfortable size (rooms on the 1st and 2nd floor were bigger) but we were more than happy with ours - and with a great (side) view of the Rialoto market and Grand Canal. The room was immaculately clean and very comfortable (including the bed's mattress - even though our double was made up of two singles). The room was a little warm and we couldn't work out how to use the heating / air conditioning - but given this was winter, it didn't matter. Also, can't believe that others have complained about no English TV - BBC world news, CNN and Sky News are all freely available ... and if you really want to watch English TV rather than enjoy Venice you must be mad! Breakfast was excellent - with a wide range of options included (including standard English, continental) and being Italy, you even had Proseco freely available to go with your meal. The staff were extremely attentive and helpful - but remained unobtrusive. We seem to spend an age enjoying our breakfasts with numerous fresh pots of tea and coffee being offered. Could not fault the service, the quality of the food or the lovely room in which it is served in the slightest. Having found found some fantastic little restaurants not too far from the hotel, reception made the reservations for us. Each evening we had a drink in the hotel bar, where they weren't cheap, but it was a great way to start the evening (again with very attentive, helpful, unobtrusive staff) - and a lovely range of canapes were provided and replenished.

We asked at Reception why we could not access the Sky News option on this menu and the receptionist said he would investigate this for us whilst we were out for the day. When we returned, we could still not access this service but we received no feedback from the receptionist as to why. We explored other options, perhaps thinking we would watch a film (whilst resting during a very hot day) from the 'Blockbusters' menu, but the 14 euros to be charged for a film like 'Gladiator' ( c.10 years old?) put us off! There was also a significant charge if you wanted to listen to any music from the main menu. There was good free wi-fi access, though. The other problem was the breakfast service, which we found to be only average. On our last morning, we had a very early one as we had to catch a train at 8.30 am.

I politely told the front desk staff that I would rather he photocopy it right now and give in back to me. I was very abruptly told that it's not policy but he would hold up everyone and the process 'for my unreasonable demands'. Latter that night we had tickets to the opera. We discovered that my husbands suit and my gown were horribly crushed I called gown to housekeeping for an iron. I was told that being a palace we were not allowed to plug and appliances in but he would sort it out for him. Happy with the response the clothes were collected and returned latter ironed. It wasn't until checkout that we discovered a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac100 bill on checkout for pressing. I was appalled and told the manager so. He informed my husband that we had obviously spent little time in Europe because all pressing was charged. My problem is no one ever told us we would be charged. That same night my husband got very sick. On calling down to the front desk for assistance we had a language problem. I went down to find someone that could help me. Visibly upset I was told to try back in the morning when someone was on that spoke English. I find this very strange in a five star hotel. I was left wandering the streets of Venice looking for a chemist. There are much better hotels in Venice.

This was part of a nine-week European trip where we stayed in 12 hotels (primarily 5 star). We almost always stay in a Four Seasons Hotel when available and our review should be assessed in this light. The Ca Segrado is a beautiful little hotel located about a 10-15 minute walk from both the train station and St. Mark's Square. It is a former Noble House with large rooms and bathrooms. The room is furnished with beautiful period pieces of high quality and that are also surprisingly functional. The air conditioning was quiet and efficient. The shower and bathtub were combined but it was large and easy to use. The hotel has a fantastic little bar looking directly onto the canal. While the drinks are expensive, they provide excellent snacks. The head waiter is charming. It is a fantastic place to have a drink (or two!) before heading out to dinner. The breakfasts at the hotel were among the best that we had in Europe and are provided in a beautiful room with exceptionally high ceilings. Unlike most other holels, scrambled and hard boiled eggs were included. The staff are friendly and helpful, and come close to levels provided by the Four Seasons Hotels. In short, the Ca Segrado is a great place to stay and, given the relatively few reviews on TA, is a hidden gem in Venice. Some tips: 1. There is an excellent gelato store located about 2 blocks from the hotel. It is called \"Grom\". From the side entrance, walk back to the main street and turn left. it is about 2-3 blocks away on the right side of the road. The gelato is made fresh daily on the premises. 2. There are two really good restaurants close by. The first is Trattoria Ca d'Oro, located at Calle Ca d'Oro 3912, about 2 blocks from the hotel (and not too far from Grom's). It is a small family restaurant with a limited menu but excellent. Dinner for three was about 75 euros (excellent value)! The other is Fiaschetteria Toscana, located at San Giovanni Grisitomo 5719, about a 10 minute walk from the hotel on the main walking street just past the Rialto Bridge. All food was good but ask the waiter for his recommendation. Price was about 200 euros for 3 people. Reservations for both restaurants are a must. 3. From the train station, the water taxi to the hotel took 10 minutes and cost 50 euros 4. Laundry is very expensive. There is a coin laundromat on Ruga Giuffa, very close to S. Maria Formosa. It was about 10 minutes from the hotel and 5 minutes from St. Mark's Square. 5. Do the gondola early, before 9:30 am. After that, there are far too many on the water and the charm of the ride is lost by the very crowded waterways. We paid 80 euros for a 40 minute ride. Prices seem to be pretty standard. 6. While the Rialto Bridge is about a 5 minute walk from the hotel, you can cross the canal using a \"gondola ferry\" right in front of the Ca Segregado Hotel. Cost is only 0.5 euro per person and takes about 2 minutes. There is a fantastic open-air food market right across from the hotel.", "Date": "August 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cAmazing Hotel, Romantic, Clean, Friendly, Conveninent spot!\u201d", "Author": "WorldTravelersHNM", "ReviewID": "UR116220909", "Content": "Can't recommend a better hotel.. honeymoon trip started in Venice, and was the best hotel we stayed at in all of Italy.

I must say we certainly weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t disappointed, it is a beautiful hotel and the staff were extremely helpful and courteous. This is where I proposed to my partner and the hotel organised the gondola ride for me and took care of all the details. It was decided that we would return to Venice to get married and what better than to stay at the ca\u00e2\u20ac\u2122sagrado again. After contacting them about this they were extremely helpful in helping us organise everything as we wanted to hold the reception at the hotel also. From the start all the way through they were fantastic!! Upon arrival which was quite late at night, we were shown to our room number 316. When we entered we were both overwhelmed with the room it was absolutely beautiful and they couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have picked a better room for us. All throughout our stay the management and staff including Elisabeth who dealt with everything for us were amazing and the attention to detail and the service we received was second to none! NOTHING was too much trouble. We was even able to taste the food from the menu we had chosen which we did the day after arriving for lunch\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.the food was out of this world, the chef came and spoke to us about it and discussed the ingredients etc. On the day of the wedding 4th July the housekeeper arrived early to tidy the room (which they done about twice a day without delay or asking) to then allow the photographer to take pictures. The hotel organised all our transport etc and gondolas for the day also. Upon returning from the ceremony at the Palazzo Cavalli our guests were treated to canap\u00c3\u00a9s and champagne. Again the service from the staff was second to none with us receiving a glass and a greeting from the manager. After this we went to the music room for the meal where the tables were decorated beautifully and the food was served with some background music. All throughout the meal the waiters were extremely attentive, filling glasses etc etc and the food was amazing, all the guests commented on the food. We also had children who had the adult menu but wanted to change to the children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s menu on the day and even this was no problem and was done without fuss. After the meal etc and when myself and my bride returned to the hotel there was a complimentary bottle of champagne waiting for us. During our stay the staff even took the time out to explain the history of the hotel and show us around various parts which the gentlemen did because he had an interest which you could tell, this again was a lovely touch. The day after our wedding we had to check out as we had booked the final 2 days at another 5star luxury hotel, and to be honest we wish we could of stayed at the Ca\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Sagredo (we even asked them before we left if we could) All in all an AMAZING experience and the staff were all amazing, kind and friendly who always had a smile, where nothing was too much trouble and the service we received was not forced or fake if you know what I mean.

The frescos and large format paintings that line the walls and adorn the ceilings are truly breathtaking. It's like the hotel is built out of 18th century masterpieces.

They gave us really concise directions through the city, and they even had a complimentary tour of the Rialto Market with the hotel's chef. The daily breakfast was delicious and included in the price. The price was the highest I have ever paid for a hotel room, but our room was on the Grand Canal and had views all the way to Piazza San Marco. I did my homework before spending so much money on a hotel room and was confident that I would have paid almost twice as much for a similar room in one of the more notable luxury hotels. I also doubt that staying at one of the other luxury hotels would have resulted in such a romantic stay. As such, I feel like Ca Sagredo is a tremendous value for ultra high end luxury.

I arrived at the hotel by water taxi (50 Euros) and docked at a private landing outside the lobby, but the vaporetto stop (Ca'd'Oro #1 line) is next to the hotel as well for a less expensive arrival. A traghetto stop (50 cents) is just outside the front entry to cross the canal without using one of the bridges (remember to remain standing to get the proper experience!).

We were also told that the only place we could freshen up was in the two toilet cubicles next to the bar and as previously said served all the public rooms in the hotel. We also were not treated to a guided tour or any explanation of the hotel services ,We didn't recieve any welcoming gift , not even chocolates like the review before did. We had booked a Double room with a panoramic urban view, this was a little disappointing, there was no view as the room(402) was on the top floor and didn't have a window, it had a outside space but all you could see from it was the rooftops of the surrounding hotels and that was only if you were 6ft tall or above.. The room was beautifully decorated but we were very disappointed that it was quite small, the bathroom on the other hand was massive which was a very strange layout, i personally would have prefered a bigger room and smaller bathroom. The reception didn't have a information desk for trips,guides and events etc which would have been helpful as at the end of our stay we found a leaflet for venice guided tours , something which we would liked to have done. The hotel was very grand, everything was decorated tastefully and you really felt like you were in a palace. The location is also great - far enough away from the excesses of St Marco, but still in the real Venice. Lots of small cafes and shops are around the hotel,Also being next door to the Vaparetto stop means that getting to/from the hotel is easy for sightseeing. Overall it was a very nice hotel, i somehow got a feeling though that as soon as the hotel knew i had booked with expedia we were given one of the worse rooms as our room didn't look like any of the official hotel photos.

As we arrived around noon our room was not yet ready which we had planned for so had a change of clothes in our hand luggage. However we were told that the only place we could freshen up was in the two toilet cubicles next to the bar/restaurant one of which was occupied. As these toilets served all the public rooms in the hotel we felt obliged to rush.. Unlike some other guests we were not treated to a guided tour or any explanation of the hotel services (the lady from reception who showed us to our room advised that she was just finishing for the day). There was no hotel guide in the room so we had to go back to reception to ask where brteafast was served and at what time etc. Unlike other (lower star) hotels we stayed at during this trip there was no welcoming bottle of Prosecco - although the chocolate covered strawberries and cherries were gorgeous. We had booked a junior suite with front canal view. The room (304) was beautifully decorated but we were very disappointed that the sitting area was split from the bed room by the bathroom. Some people might have thought it cosy but it was a bit claustrophobic for us and so we did not use. The bathroom had no separate shower (mainly because it was too small). There was only one narrow window (no foot balcony) opening onto the canal. If we had known all this in advance we would not have upgraded our room. We had made advance reservations for a quiet and romantic table in the downstairs restaurant for both nights of our stay however when we arrived at the restaurant we were told that there was no reservation. We were given a table and whilst the food and service was good by this time we were so disappointed that we decided to eat somewhere else the following night. On the second day things started to look up. We found the breakfast room on the first floor \u00e2\u20ac\u201c WOW. The breakfast was pretty good too.

Words really can't describe the palazzo itself and the 17th/18th century art that surrounds you. Smokers beware: you can't smoke in the building because of the presence of so many great works of art (we were grateful). And the location is absolutely perfect, although the Ca' D'Oro vaporetto stop in front could be a problem if you're a light sleeper, but do yourself a favor: stay here anyway, just bring earplugs. It's that good. On a different note, the dinner we had in the restaurant here was the best we had in Venezia. The food was absolutely electric and inspired, prepared and presented perfectly. Even if we weren't staying here, we'd go to this restaurant. Truly an astonishing meal. If I were to be critical of anything, and it's a minor criticism, the wine list is neither broad nor deep. It's understandable, as they don't seem to be doing anything to promote the restaurant independently, and perfectly acceptable, as there appeared to be many reasonable wine choices (including the Valpolicella we had).

Anyway in saying that ,the hotel is ideally situated being very convienent for all the attractions of st marks and rialdo bridge area, there are some great eateries and bars just a simple stroll from the hotel which are not as pricey as some you may find nearer to st marks, try out \"la cantina\" a great wine bar that not only has a good selection of wines and a few good beers but also serves some great food home made soups and fab paninis. also near by is a great local italian restaurant called \"Vini da Gigio\" i took the recommendation from another review and didnot regret it, but book early as it gets very busy.

When they did and I accepted offer without negotiation I asked for a courtesy boat taxi to pick us up from the train station as we were 8. Answer was 'no, we dont do that, we offer flowers and a bottle of champagne'. I pointed out this was a large booking, their biggest suites, no reduction requested in rate, flowers & champagne are a standard in any suite and still got a 'no'. Finally the general manager cleared the minor expense of the boat taxi on a 'one time offer only'. Very mean & tight fisted and indeed shortsighted of this hotel. How do they hope to get returning guests like us? And they are brand new? Rooms were nice enough (no rooms in Venice are really, truly incredible - none I have found at least), bathrooms are brand new, public areas are a little like a convent and cold - lacking in splendour as far as decor goes. Entrance hall & lobby really are too boring & balnd. Breakfast is pleasant enough. Ballroom is stunning. Restaurant is tiny and very unimpressive looking. Biggest issue for em is the location. Although tshi hotel hopes to be the new 5 star luxury hotel of Venice it will not be able to compete on location with all the older 5 stars which are all much, much closer to San Marco. This hotel is closer to the train station & as such the area is not the grandest in Venice and high end shopping cannot be done in the area.

We enjoyed it very much and were full of the 'high' of being away as we are both busy working parents of three! We stayed in room 316 which is a Junior Suite at the side of the hotel. It was beautiful, very palatial but would need to be at about 650 euro a night. We had no complaints about the room-looking at a stucco ceiling every night, three tvs and a marble bathroom is wonderful. Our present from the hotel for our trip was chocolate dipped strawberries which we thought was a bit cheap. I agree a lot with the last reviewer's account. The breakfast is not 5 star standard. I have had much better breakfasts in 4 stars in Ireland. If you wanted a freshly bolied egg, you had to pay 7 euro!! We had dinner in the hotel restaurant one night. This was not a great experience. The 'restaurant' is a six table alcove with a heavy emphasis on fish. I ended up ordering breaded veal with chips and I didn't expect to see chips on a 5 star menu. Wouldn't eat there again. The hotel's location is perfect in the Canareggio region of the city which is much nicer than near the Rialto bridge. It felt more real than further up the canal. Venice is the most amazing city I have been to and I would recommend everyone to go. Its stunningly beautiful and not as expensive as you might expect but then I live in Ireland where the cost of living is quite high!!!!!!! Ca Segredo is lovely and we have great memories.

Venice is a truely beautiful place. When we told friends about it they kept saying about the smell, and dirty river etc. But honestly we found no smell (and the weather was hot in August when we were there), and the water was no more dirty than most places, no debris, just a sea green colour. We arrived at the Hotel by Water Taxi which cost 50 Euro, a lot for a trip which is about a mile or so, but worth it simply for the experience. We arrived at the Hotel and were greeted by the Concierge and escorted in to the large and beautiful reception hall. The Reception staff were very friendly and speak excellent English, check-in was simple and quick, and we were personally taken to our Suite by the Receptionist. We had booked a Junior Suite (Without River View), and it was really beautifully furnished, very spacious, with a neat little lounge area, three TV's, Internet Access (chargeable), Marble Bathrooom etc. The staff were also very friendly, and booked a couple of tours we wanted to go on - the Ghost Tour, and the Water Taxi Tour, they were also very helpful in recommending where to eat, although Italy generally isn't great for a lot of vegetarian variety , Pizza and Tomato Pasta get a little dull for 7 days, but we can't complain we still ate very well :-) We found the location excellent - and easy walking distance to St Marco and all the sights. The building lived up to all you would expect from a 15th Century Palace, with wall and ceiling Frescoes etc, all very palacial, and added to their immaculately clean everywhere. Breakfast was simple but nice, and had lots of fresh fruit, breads, yoghurts, cereals, scambled eggs, meats, and a great slection of 'Revolution Teas', I sell these in my Cafe in Belfast, and have never had them anywhere else before - Top Quality! Every night we had a trun down service, chocolates on our pillow, and little cotton towels placed on the carpet each side of the bed. Fluffy white dressing gowns, fluffy white slippers, lots of generously sized toiletries etc. We ate in the Hotel Restaurant one night, but were a bit limited by choice being vegetarians, also we confused the staff a bit (language barrier) and got three instead of four courses, but it was nice, and beautiful located outside right on the river.

Hard to write a negative review, but I feel that I must. It's really a combo of good and bad... Here is the good: The hotel itself is beautiful. The room we had was a multi-level suite and it was jaw droppingly pretty and roomy. The hotel is large and has been decorated well. We didn't eat at the restaurant but when we arrived we had a couple of cocktails out on the patio overlooking the water. The lady checking us in at the front desk was very courteous and hospitable, as well as the young man concierge, the staff at the restaurant/bar, and a man at the front desk upon checkout. The bad: This may seem tedious to some people, but it was enough to ruin any good feeling the hotel's first impression had on us. This was our first trip to Italy, and the second city we visited. We were a little unsure of the tipping etiquette, but had heard that you do not tip unless you are overly satisfied with any service you receive. The hotel employs a bellman who is in his mid/early 40's with dark hair, slightly balding. He brought up our bags and set them down, and stood around a second and then left. We were not sure if he expected a tip, but he had already gone so we didn't worry about it. We called to request extra pillows and he returned to show us where they were in the room. He stood around a bit longer, and seemed a bit flustered, so I felt that he did in fact expect a tip. I asked my husband to hand him the 10 euros he had, and we asked the bellman for 5 euros in return (we had 2 suitcases). He quickly and gruffly said he had no change, put the 10 euros in his pocket and hastily left the room. To be honest we were stunned...we just paid $17 for a bellman to bring up 2 pieces of luggage and show us pillows that were already in the room. We felt like we had been robbed. We tried to just use that as a learning experience, but it taints your experience nonetheless. We encountered a few more instances of 'rudeness' and overpricing by the gondola guys and the water taxis. It's amazing that such a beautiful, historical city has people like this, that don't mind being total jerks and/or try to rip you off with a straight face. I guess we are just too naive and nice when it comes to dealing with people and when visiting other countries. And who knows, maybe we just encountered all these people at once... What should have been a magical memory for a country that we would want to return to, became a place that we speak negatively of, and do not at all wish to return to.

We had never been to Venice before and my husband found the hotel on Tripadvisor and was impressed with most of the reviews. The hotel was totally in keeping with what we wanted for a special, romantic short break and could not have been better situated - right on the Grand Canal, opposite the Rialto Market, next to the Ca D'Oro and around the corner from the Rialto Bridge, but away from the crowds around St Mark's Square. Having arrived by private water taxi from the airport - the BEST way to travel, James Bond style! - we were warmly met at Ca Sagredo's own landing stage. The staff were very professional and courteous and as we had arrived before 2pm, we were shown to the outside Terrace for morning coffee. The sun duly emerged from behind the clouds and the view of the Canal, market and passing boats of all descriptions, was fabulous. We had booked a Grand Canal Passage two night package directly with the hotel, which included a Prestige Double Room with Grand Canal view, a half hour Gondola Ride and Afternoon Tea. You can imagine our faces when we were shown to our room, which turned out to be an upgrade to one of their top two Suites - Suite Count Sagredo. The room was huge, beautiful decorated with period furnishings and antiques, its own hallway and massive marble bathroom with twin sinks and separate bath and power shower cubicle. There was also not one, but THREE stone balconies overlooking the Grand Canal! I don't think I stopped squealing with delight for half an hour and could have kissed the Bell Boy! Drawing the heavy drapes at the windows, throwing open the shutters and standing on each of the three balconies in turn in the sunshine, listening to the church bells literally bought tears of wonder to my eyes! The hotel has both a grand and intimate feel, with palatial public rooms and breathtaking paintings and frescos. We enjoyed a wonderful first night dinner in the Hotel's own Restaurant, with highly attentive staff. The Soave wine was like nectar and, just before dessert, the lights suddenly went out and the waiter appeared with a candelit Birthday cake and complimentary pastries, which was a lovely, personal touch. Breakfast was more than adequate, with an array of tempting hot and cold dishes to choose from, and lovely staff. As with previous reviews, our only complaints were minor and did not ruin our stay in any way. There was some confusion and delay over the delivery of our welcoming bottle of prosecco and chocolate dipped strawberries, together with our Gondola voucher; we were not given a preliminary guided tour of the public rooms before we were shown to our room (which so many reviewers seem to have had), and the Restaurant was a little lacking in atmosphere. With the curtains drawn, it was slightly too brightly lit and the adjoining \"Lounge Bar\", is small and more like an extension of the Restaurant, rather than a welcoming and casual place to sit, with fine views. In contrast, the Breakfast Room and adjoining rooms on the first floor are more impressive and have a wonderful Venetian feel about them. Overall, we could not have stayed in a more luxurious room, and even the sound of the passing vaporettos at night through the open shutters added to the experience of staying on a working Canal in the middle of a magical City. The sun shone for us during our entire stay, the proximity of the Traghetto stop right next to the hotel was wonderful, as we could zip back and forth across the Canal for 50 cents each way, and our Gondola ride at sunset was the icing on the cake. Contrary to some reviews, we found the staff to be extremely pleasant and helpful at all times and I can't wait to return one day. Ca Sagredo is not cheap but is worth every penny and, compared with its larger five star competitors, I would choose Ca Sagredo every time. Not only for its history and location, but also for its stunning beauty and warmth.", "Date": "March 29, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, Canada", "Title": "\u201cA New 5-Star Standard on the Grand Canal!\u201d", "Author": "mykel67", "ReviewID": "UR14325534", "Content": "I spent a few weeks researching where to stay during our first visit to Venice (5 nights in March). We wanted to stay somewhere memorable \u00e2\u20ac\u201c luxurious and prototypically Venice. I began with what most of thef guidebooks considered to be the best hotels (Gritti, Danieli, Luna) but the reviews here on Tripadvisor were very critical of these properties. Luckily an auction package through Luxurylink.com or the Ca\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Sagredo caught my attention; it seemed to fit the bill perfectly. I bid on the package, was the only bidder, and purchased 4 nights in a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Water View Prestige Double\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (including breakfast, and a welcome bottle of prosecco & strawberries) for $972 US. This was an absolute steal given that the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s website rate for this room was 450 Euros per night, and the best rate I could find elsewhere was through Expedia for $525 US per night! Since we were arriving late we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to spend an additional 450 Euros for an extra night at the Ca\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Sagredo, so we stayed at the Hilton Molino Stucky (another bargain through Priceline, and a fine hotel as well). The next day we took the Hilton's shuttle to San Marco, then a short vaporetto ride to the Ca D'Oro stop to check in at the Ca'Sagredo. I was impressed by how \"democratic\" the vaporetto is. It was filled with backpacking students, businessmen, tourists, and designer-clad fashionistas alike. My best experience with public transportation ever! The hotel is in the Cannaregio neighbourhood, which apparently is the most residential area in Venice proper. There are lots of terrific restaurants patronized by Venetians (and not tourists being offered \u00e2\u20ac\u0153tourist menus\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd at exorbitant prices). It may seem removed from the hustle and bustle (and that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s probably a good thing), but we walked everywhere. After a day or two the area becomes familiar and you can find your way to San Marco, the Rialto or wherever in no time at all! Upon our arrival, the Ca'Sagredo took our breath away; it's unlike any other placed we've ever stayed (very much like a boutique hotel dropped, seamlessly, into a museum!) Our bags were taken from us as soon as we entered the lobby (the bellman politely insisted on taking even our handheld bags), and the check-in process was handled quickly and efficiently. The office manager gave us a detailed guided tour of the building. His commentary was very informed and interesting, and we were immediately impressed by the sheer scale and grandeur of the place. The murals by Tiepolo and the trompe l\u00e2\u20ac\u2122oeil in the ballroom are particularly noteworthy. I think it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a great thing that the hotel obviously tried very hard not to tread on the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153footprint\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of the original building too much. There were fresh flowers in all the public rooms, and any staff we passed smiled and offered a polite \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Buongiorno\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd -a terrific introduction to our home for the week! We were then shown to our room \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 106, with a view down the Grand Canal. The first thing we did was pull back the curtains and open the leaded casement windows to drink in the view. Breathtaking! The room was very luxuriously appointed, and there was a bottle of prosecco and chocolate covered strawberries waiting for us (along with a \"welcome\" note from the manager). This was exactly the type of accommodation we'd been hoping for. It felt very \"Venetian,\" but unlike the criticisms we'd read of the Gritti & Danieli, everything was in pristine condition. The Frette linens on the bed were a delight to slip between each night. The bathroom was not as large as the one in our room at the Hilton, but it was encased in marble and very well appointed. The towels and bathrobes were fluffy, and the toiletries were of a high quality (Gilchrist & Soames). It was nice to have CNN on the flat screen television while shaving and brushing our teeth each morning. Turndown service was a nice touch each night. The maid would leave chocolates and a room service breakfast menu on the pillow, replace any used towels in the bathroom, close the exterior shutters and draw the curtains. Because the room is on the canal you can hear some noise in the morning as the area comes to life, but it was not a problem for us. The shutters, three layers of drapery and upholstered walls worked quite well at muffling the sounds. We ate breakfast each morning under a Tiepolo ceiling, and sometimes took our cappuccino (delicious) out onto the stone balcony overlooking the Grand Canal. How much more atmosphere could one ask for? It was the same buffet each day, and while not as varied as those at other 5 star hotels we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve stayed at, it was still satisfying. The only disappointment was the lack of freshly squeezed orange juice. The juices offered were obviously from a concentrate. Service was pleasant and efficient. On our last night we had drinks in the small lounge and dinner at L\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Alcova, the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s restaurant. I imagine in the summer these rooms would be very appealing with the windows open to allow the sounds of the canal to float in. There is also a terrace on which tables are set up during the warmer weather. On that particular night, however, it was quite cold out, so the windows were closed and the draperies drawn to keep the patrons comfortable and the attention focused on the food and your company. We enjoyed traditional Venetian spritzes, which were served with complimentary hors d\u00e2\u20ac\u2122oeuvres. Then we moved to our table in the intimate dining room, where we were served complimentary prosecco. We both ordered the four course chef\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s menu, and it was an excellent choice: an amuse bouche of succulent shrimp wrapped with the most delicate rice pasta; a delicious pasta course of baby shrimp in a tomato and basil sauce; grilled sea bass; and a gorgeous dessert platter. The meal included a bottle of Venetian wine, and when we finished that, the waiter brought us another complimentary half-bottle of another variety. I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t say enough about the service during that meal \u00e2\u20ac\u201c truly outstanding. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be put off by the dining room\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s small size or a lack of patrons - that dinner was a highlight of our trip! The next morning we had a 7 AM flight to catch, so they arranged for us to have a light breakfast in the restaurant at 4:30 AM before catching a 5 AM vaporetto to the airport. I just assumed we would eat after we got to the departure lounge \u00e2\u20ac\u201c how nice that the hotel offered to cater to our schedule without our even having to ask! The staff could not do enough for us during our stay, and it was a joy to return to the hotel after a day of sightseeing. Everyone we dealt with was warm, friendly, efficient and extremely professional. I must make special mention of Sylvia, who went above and beyond in assisting us in a variety of situations: arranging for tickets to a Vivaldi concert, booking us on the Doge\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Palace secret itinerary tour, helping locate a suitcase left on the vaporetto, translating when there was a problem using a bank card at a local instant teller. She is a terrific asset to the hotel! So if you are searching for a very special hotel in Venice, one that captures all the romance and history of the city but does not compromise on quality of accommodations or service, the Ca\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Sagredo is the perfect choice. Rest assured, there was no smell of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sewage\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the week we were there; there most definitely is an elegant, refined, subdued atmosphere throughout the hotel; there ARE vantage points from which to view the Grand Canal (both from inside and from terraces and balconies outside); and there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nothing \u00e2\u20ac\u0153haunted\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd about a hotel that so lovingly and meticulously embraces its past role as a palazzo home to Venetian nobility. What a privilege to stay in such a special place! The Ca\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Sagredo deserves every one of its five stars.

I was terribly disappointed with our stay here - maybe because I had such high expectations. Yes the hotel is housed in an old palace but thats where the romanticsm ends. We found the hotel to be so cold, uninviing with just big empty rooms that have so much potential but are simply wasted. We were there in the middle of carnival and there was never a soul to be seen. I felt like I was in a haunted house. You wouldnt know you were on the Grand Canal as there are no decent viewing points or doors leading out onto any balcony. I envisaged a sumptuous breakfast being served on a balcony somewhere but it was in a cold, too-brightly-lit back-room with no atmospehere whatsoever. There was never anyone in the downstairs \"restaurant\" - a white-walled, brightly-lit, closed-in, square room with the ambience of...I dont know what. Our room was a corner \"Suite\" - isnt a suite meant to have more than just a room with a bed in it? The fake floorboards with a large mat thrown over the top nearly killed us each day as everything was so slippery and we kept tripping on the mat. There were 2 single-standing chairs in the room that were always in the way and completely unneccesary - I nearly threw them out the window just to make some space. The bathroom was really very small with the (totally unecessary) bidet right as you walk in such that the door wouldnt open all the way. What little bench space there was, was taken up with a TV screen - who's going to watch TV on the loo? It was all very disappointing and not what I was expecting. On the up-side it has its own water-taxi landing right at the front door which helped getting to and from the balls in big costumes but that was about it. And no-one seems to have the guts to say it so I'll be the first. The entire building reeks of the usual Venice sewerage stench. I know its a problem too hard to fix but you cant consider yourself 5-star when the smell hits you every time you walk in the door.
