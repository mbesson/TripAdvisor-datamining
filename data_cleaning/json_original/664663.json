These people have clearly not stayed in Hong Kong before. The rooms here are HUGE compared to most hotels! Honestly, if you have enough room to open the door without it hitting the bed, you're doing well. At JJ Hotel you can see the carpet and walk around - for HK that's amazing. Not only that, but the rooms are spotlessly clean and well designed, with a good glass-walled bathroom. This isn't the Ritz-Carlton, it's a good solid three-star business hotel, and for the price it's probably the best value I've seen in the entire territory. Not only that, but though it seems to be run by a skeleton staff, they still manage to do things well. There was a minor problem with my booking and the charming Kiko on reception was able to fix it after only a few emails. I couldn't hook up to the (free, VERY fast) WiFi and within minutes two engineers were there fixing everything. Turned out the problem was my computer not their router. Embarrassing. Even the cleaner was exceptionally friendly and very apologetic about cleaning my room when I was working in it. Don't apologise, you're doing me a favour! There are nice little touches too: a huge TV, and a DVD player with a free DVD library at reception. There's a kettle and free tea and coffee too. And the location is exceptional - close to the tram, 5 mins from the MTR, 10 mins walk to the shops in Causeway Bay, right in the glorious hubbub of south Wanchai with about five hundred restaurants and cafes within a few minutes' walk. My only complaint is that there was no heating. HK was pretty chilly when I stayed, and it would have been nice to have been a little warmer when in the room during the day, as I was using it as an office for three days. If you're looking for somewhere to stay that is competently run, relatively spacious, well located, and not extortionate - while acknowledging that there will be no frills (no bar, no restaurant, no breakfast) - I highly recommend this place.", "Date": "February 2, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cWonderful Experience at JJ Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Jessica S", "ReviewID": "UR123549359", "Content": "We stayed at this hotel for a couple nights.

Wan Chai is a vibrant place to stay, lively even at 11pm. The eating outlets are enormous, quite hard to choose. Love to ride on the tram (tram stop is nearby) to get to Causebay bay, admiralty, Happy valley. Walked early in the morning to Bowen road, Kennedy Road and surprisingly ended at Hong Kong Park. The garden near to the tea museum is lovely and one could get a lovely shot of Lippo building(\" Koala Building) there . From there the short cut to Admiralty MTR and tram stop back to wan chai through Pacific Place is a great discovery for me.

Took us a few people to ask before we finally located this hotel from the A11 Bus from the airport. I guessed it would have been easier if we arrived via MTR Airport Express from the airport. In the event that you get lost, ask somebody from other \"boutique\" hotels which are everywhere in this place, not from someone in the street. Even guys at nearby 711 won't be able to tell you where JJ Hotel is. It might help to ask where Emperor Group Center is, that is one big building along Hennesy Rd. (the main road) and directly behind Emperor Group Center's building is Lucky Center, where JJ Hotel is. We booked a superior room, 2 beds for four nights. The room is very clean, the bathroom with glass enclosure is a nice touch to an otherwise plain room. The beds are quite hard, which is a personal preference. So far, everything that's in this room (Rm 903) works. Only complaint is the cable TV whose channels number like, 6 and out of the 6 channels, only one is an English channel. There's a DVD machine, but you have to pay HKD 50 to \"borrow\" a movie from the library at the reception. If you will be out the whole day, like us, and would only be needing a shower and nice bed to sleep on at night, then this is ok. There are no hotel amenities to speak of, this is a no-frills, standard hotel. You get what you pay for and frankly, not bad for a budget hotel in Hong Kong. The only downside here is that the nearest MTR station (Wan Chai) is a few blocks away. It's NOT near esp if you are carrying massive shopping bags ALL THE TIME! While getting a cab is an option, flag down rate is HKD 20 vis a vis the MTR, bus or tram that only average between 2-5 HKD, depending on your destination. But for the love of myself (feet and arms especially) do get a cab when you think your arms and legs would like to separate from you already. Better yet, google map your hotel first before making a reservation and get those that are a building or one or two buildings/steps away from an MTR station. I guess when they say 3-5 mins walk, it may still be ok. But if it says 10-15 mins walk, that means its far! So beware. Other than the location, the hotel room is ok and if only for that, I would be staying here again. To summarize, location is a no, room cleanliness and comfort is a yes. Food?

I read through all the reviews of this hotel in Trip Advisor ahead of time so I knew what to expect. We took the A11 bus from the airport to Hennessey and Stewart Roads for $40 each; which took about 50 minutes on a Sunday morning. The hotel is only two blocks away from the bus stop. We arrived to the hotel around noon but our rooms were not ready until 2:00 pm. So we left our luggage in their storage room and went out for a walk and lunch for a couple of hours. The rooms were exactly what I expected. Decent size for HKG standard, large (but very firm) bed, free wireless internet, in-room mini-fridge and digital safe, and two complementary bottles of water. The AC in my room was putting out nice cool air. But the one in my friend room was not so much. Being it was Sunday afternoon we figured just let the reception know now and hopefully someone will come in to take a look at it the next day. Surprising enough a maintenance man stopped by few minutes later and fixed it. It turned out it was the AC unit setting of the floor in circulating mode; pumping warm outside air into the room. In no time that was fixed. I stocked up on beverages and snacks from the grocery store in the basement, the in-room mini-fridge came in handy. Public transportation in the area is good. Wan Chai and Causeway Bay MTR stations are both within walking distance. After the laser show in TST, we were thinking about taking the STAR Ferry back to the hotel. But we didn\u2019t because I did not know where the ferry would drop us off on the island. But it turned out Wan Chai Ferry Terminal is only few blocks away from the hotel. Both Wan Chai and Causeway Bay MTR stations are within walking distance.

So, for this trip, I checked out the rates and reviews of this hotel and I was quite pleased with what I read - inexpensive yet convenient and clean. I made a booking for 2 superior rooms (for me and my girlfriend and my friend's couple) for 2 nights. I read a lot of review about this hotel so I was quite aware of what to expect - it being 4-floor rented space in a commercial building with little to no service in the hotel. I was only hoping for a clean and comfortable room near the MTR station. And that was pretty much what I got. No more - no less. My Grades: Room: B The room's as spacious as most business hotels in Hong Kong (meaning not very big, only enough space for 2 mid-size luggage). The room we got was very clean, with good light from the outside and no cigarette smells. As is with other new business hotels in HK, it has a glass wall bathroom in order to make the room appear more spacious. Some may find that sexy while others may find it a bit awkward (you can bring down the shades though). One of the cons is that it has no bathtub - not good if you do a lot of walking and want to soak your feet in a warm water. Another major flaw I found in my room is that I couldn't properly shut the door of the shower area so I had to be careful not to make the bathroom floor too wet. *There was supposed to be a free in-room wi-fi connection, but I couldn't find the signal in my room at all. That doesn't seem to be the case in other rooms though. (FYI my room was 1107) Service: B- No bellboy. No concierge (that I could find). But the staff was very helpful; they responded very quickly to my emails prior to my trip and was very willing to answer any of my questions. You can rent DVDs from the hotel (2 DVDs / night for free) and there's 24-hour room service. *Since I couldn't find wi-fi signal in my room, I had to go out to the hallway to use the internet. I guess they saw me just standing there on the CCTV, they sent a maid rushing to me to see if I there was any problem or if I got myself locked out. I find that kind of nice. Facilities: C Since it was only rented floors, the hotel didn't offer anything extra. There was a meeting room on my floor and I think they have a business center. That's about it. Location: B+ I chose this hotel because I thought it'd be much closer to the MTR station than my previous hotel. Granted it's within a 5-10 minute walk, it's still farther than I'd expected. And being on Hong Kong island might not be ideal for casual tourist who visit HK for the first time since retails on this side usually cater local people and not a lot of them speak English. Aside from that, the hotel's quite convenient for a short trip; you have a supermarket in the basement of the hotel, surrounded by dozens of convenient stores, drug stores and good food vendors. Comparing to other hotels in the area: JJ Hotel is probably the only hotel near Wan Chai MTR under $700/night. Other hotels in the area are more traditional business-hotels like Charterhouse or Novotel - both farther to the MTR. Overall: B JJ Hotel's only good for a short trip to Hong Kong for people who's quite familiar with the city already. If you're already familiar with the city and you have specific purposes for your trip, or if you want to get in touch with the hectic local life, you might give this hotel a try.

It's not a full service hotel by any stretch of the imagination, it's just the rooms, and a few compact common areas - no pool, bar, restaurant or other services. The rooms include free internet access. The small office staff is professional. There's a very good restaurant, Megan's Kitchen, on the 5th floor, open for lunch and dinner. It's well known around Hong Kong for its quality, spicy Asian dishes, so try to eat there at least once. So why stay here? Value & Location. The rooms are very comfortable and clean; the beds are the most comfortable I've experienced in any hotel - my back was happy after the first night. The location is very good too, five blocks or so off the water, nestled in an area with everything one needs - banks, money exchange, coffee shops, restaurants, clothing stores, food stores, pharmacies. If you've traveled a lot, you'll quickly recognize the neighborhood-wthin-the-city feel of the area: calm, friendly, and easily negotiated. When I say calm, I mean: A notch or two below full-frenzy Hong Kong, rendering a neighborhood one can actually function in without much fatigue setting in. A few notes: The nearest MTR station ( the Hong Kong subway / Metro) is Wan Chai and it's a 2-1/2 block walk to the JJ if you take the A3 exit from the station. Not too bad if you have compact luggage with wheels. If you don't, it's better to take a taxi from the Hong Kong \"Central\" station, noting that taxis in Hong Kong are inexpensive. If you need a China visa, the China Resources Office is just five blocks away, takes about 15 minutes to walk there. Hong Kong's SoHo and other high-end tourist areas are 1-2 metro stops away. But you can also take a tram, a taxi, or even walk to these areas without much effort. Summary: If you're a seasoned traveler in search of value and simplicity, this is a good choice. If this is your first trip to the area and plan to spend most of your time exploring rather than watching TV or drinking in a hotel bar, this is also a good choice - again, because the rooms are clean and modern and the location is central to everything.

I spent there only 1 hour but they charged me for 2 hours. When I logged out from the computer, the receptionist lady promised to fill the file with the time spent in internet by herself.

The smell came from the bathroom and was a mixture of sulfur, mold and sewer. The smell was intense. Keeping the bathroom door closed helped some, but we never really got over the smell. We put up with the smell since we were out in the city from 9am until 11pm...we just used the room to sleep in. The bathroom is very interesting as it is a glass, see-through enclosure in the room.

We were given our room key & saw that this was a twin & not a double as requested. We were told that there were no other double rooms available, but we could pay $300 to upgrade to their premium room. She kindly showed us this room but it was simply a twin with the beds pushed together. We decided paying $300 to sleep in a room with the beds pushed together was not worth it so decided to stick with our original room. They had cunningly put fixed beds in the room & there was a random wooden bedside table in between the two beds. In the end we managed to manoeuvre the mattresses so that we could sleep next to each other - why they have twin rooms that can't be made into doubles I don't know, a sneaky money making exercise perhaps?? The room was relatively clean, but the bathroom had a strong sulphurous odour to it, we had to leave the door open with the a/c on high to get rid of the smell! The location is ok, you are walking distance to Times Square & the MTR station but it did feel a bit random not being in a conventional hotel! Another issue we had was having a very noisy generator to listen to throughout the night (fortunately I had packed sleeping tablets!).

We also walked to the ferry station, took ferry to Kowloon and then took bus to Science museum which the kids loved as it is very interactive. On our way back we saw \"Symphony of lights\" which is a light and sound show where 44 buildings are lit up and there is music. It happens every night at 8 pm. There are several eating places around the JJ hotel. There is KFC, Mc Donald, and a Pakistani food place just behind it. The downside of the hotel is that though they are OK with two adults and two kids checking in but they refused to give the 4th pillow, sheet or towel. They have a rule around giving only upto three items which was very strange. The bathroom as described by others is glass but that did not bother us as one of us would take the kids out while the parent would take a bath.

Location: Amazing location. Along a very busy road (plenty of local eateries, or the international fast food joints), on top of a supermarket which is really handy. Nearby stores are quite cheap for bargain hunters and there's a market nearby. A 2 minute stroll to the frequent (and cheap) trams - would definitely recommend using these, a great way to sightsee while you get from A to B. Also only 5-10 minutes to Wan Chai MRT station, plenty of buses right outside, and about 10-15 mins easy walk to the ferry terminal. Close to Central, cheapie Causeway Bay, a quick ferry to Kowloon, and a quick taxi from the Lai Kwai Fong (Central nightlife district). Couldn't be better in terms of location. The room: Clean, new, fresh towels etc each day. The glass-walled bathroom is a fun novelty - the gaps in the blinds aren't really noticable unless you're actually looking. Might want to be comfortable with your travelling partner though. The bed is huge and very comfortable, wardrobe holds a lot, even if there's not a lot of space for large luggage items. Staff: Very friendly, and helpful. JJ strikes me as a business hotel, but they go out of the way to help you with touristy questions, too. Nothing is a hassle for the staff. Restaurant: Received complimentary drinks/desserts at Megans Kitchen upon check-in - lovely restaurant, with great food. Overall: I would definitely stay here again if in Hong Kong.

At the first place, I was kinda worried of the pictures shown in tripadvisor. BUT IT WAS FOR REAL! I am not posting any photos as they are exactly what the others had posted.

Tips for you in HK Buy your personal octopus card and travel around including buying stuffs in Markets and Restaurants. For those backpack travelers or student who wishes to save more money on your transfer to the Hotel. Take a Blue Taxi from HK airport to TungChung MTR which costs you about max 50HKD including huge luggages(3) or Bus at 3.50HKD from Airport to TungChung Station. Take Trains to the City by MTR to Wan Chai Station for 18HKD. It would be much cheaper than taking the airport express(60HKD) as TungChung MTR line is traveling alongside the airport express way only that the line will stop in more stations. From airport to JJ hotel will take you about 55minutes including walking time. I took taxi upon my arrival at 330HKD which took me about 35minutes at night. Speak cantonese would not make you a Big Fish to them. Traveling to Macau from the Ferry terminal is at 146HKD(counter) for one-way ticket(afternoon price). But if you buy it from agents, you could get cheaper rates at 140HKD(only in HK) as Macau Terminal has no agents before the counters. I am going for this Hotel again this Summer! Will not miss it!

Overall a very pleasant stay and I can thoroughly recommend.", "Date": "November 25, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cInteresting and Modern Boutique Hotel\u201d", "Author": "dloren00", "ReviewID": "UR20671961", "Content": "This hotel is excellent for the money. The room is modern and very comfortable. It is in a very good location close to downtown and the subway system. I should note that the hotel is hard to find as it is in an office building on a crowded street. This, I've heard, is common for hotels in Hong Kong, but It was the first time that I've seen this. Make sure that you have the full address when you seek out the hotel. I was walking around a bit in the heat looking for it. Also, the bathroom walls are made out of glass. So this means that you can block out the view of the bathroom toilet and shower by pulling down the shades in the bathroom. Also interesting. But please do not be put off by these two notes . . . the hotel was an excellent place to stay and I would definitely return.", "Date": "October 6, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney", "Title": "\u201cEnjoyable stay\u201d", "Author": "cat66hie", "ReviewID": "UR16163787", "Content": "Was quite happy with JJ hotel. Stayed their with a friend, and were just looking for a place to stay for our last night in Hong kong. The Lucky centre is not a huge landmark in Wanchai, so your taxi driver might not know exactly how to get there. Also, it is a 'centre', so there isn't a lobby or reception on the ground floor, just a security guard/conceirge who isn't that helpful (had to pull our own suitcases). The hotel only take certain level of the building. Room: Every thing is really new, but the room is quite SMALL (had a queen sized bed, and it took up the majority of the room). The bathroom is more of a space next to the bed which is surrounded by glass. You need to pull the blinds down everytime you need to use the toilet which was annoying - plus you should be quite comfortable with your room mate as you can hear everything! There was free wireless which was quite handy, and a small flat screen tv and DVD player. Location: really conveniant - about a 5 min walk to the MTR and right in the middle of Wanchai. There are lots of places to eat, especially nice bread/pastry stores. Service: They have common areas which have a lounge area with complimentary biscuits and tea etc. People at reception were quite helpful in giving advice about using the check in at Airport Express, and quite accomodating when we said we would like to use a boardroom to sort out our luggage after we checked out. But they seemed a little inexperianced (looked like students). For the price I would be very happy to stay again - main good points are the location, and comfort of the room in terms of cleanliness.", "Date": "May 18, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "England", "Title": "\u201cLoved JJ's\u201d", "Author": "CuteCharlie", "ReviewID": "UR15882336", "Content": "We just completed a 3 night stay at JJ's hotel in Hong Kong.

The staff is not exactly helpful but they are perfectly nice, one just has to ask for their help if you know what I mean, the hotel is located on floors 9 - 12 and the reception is on 9 so that means on some days you do not meet the staff, if you are not in need this is a good thing. The JJ is in a very central location between causewaybay and admirality (central) the neighborhood is safe and friendly. Overall I think it was a great value and it provided everything we needed, wifi, a clean room and a big bed. Beware, most of the hotels in Hong Kong are freezing cold, the JJ is not an exception, in the summer this is OK in the winter it is not, heat is not a standard in the summer but a/c is!

It was in my price range and since I couldn't find any negative reviews I decided to go with them. I booked a deluxe room thru Asiatravel.com and their rates were much lower than JJ's published rate. First of all it was a little difficult to locate due to the disorienting Wan Chai Road. It parallels Johnston Road but also intersects with it. Even with a printout from Google Maps it was still a task finding it walking from the Wan Chai MTR station. There is signage for the hotel but very small so you have to keep your eyes open. Once you find it, it's a piece of cake getting back to the MTR. A 10-minute walk on average and not the 5-8 as advertised. Room was very clean with a simplistic Japanese feel to it. No dirty bedspreads to worry about since all you have is a comforter. The mattress was very firm but comfortable. Had all the amenities we needed including free wi-fi. One weird thing was their all glass bathroom. If you like to watch each other make toilet or take a shower then this is your dream come true! There are pull down blinds to cover the glass but it doesn't give total coverage and there is no lock on the door. Very interesting. Don't be surprised when you're not greeted with warmth and a smile. I stayed there for 5 nights and didn't see one smile from their staff. I'm not sure if it's their culture not to smile but I found it very discourteous.
