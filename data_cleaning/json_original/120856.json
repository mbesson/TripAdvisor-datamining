I\u00c2\u00a0arrived at Nine O Five Royal hotel to be greeted by painters and waited a bit till Joyce came out to greet me. It was a little awkward and not the warm southern hospitality I was expecting but she was still pleasant. I read some horrible reviews about this place but decided to give it a go. When I was shown my room it seemed kind of run down and dirty but still charming in a rustic way. I pulled back the sheets and literally found at least 8 hairs. I was going to let it go but at the bottom of the sheets was a clump of eyelashes- disgusting! I went to the office and pretty much had the door slammed in my face by a blonde woman with bad teeth. I kindly asked her to assist and I have never been so shocked by the response. If she hadn't said she worked at the hotel I would have thought I had stumbled into a mental asylum. She first went into crazy denial and called me a fool, I stayed polite and said it sometimes happens in very good hotels and all I wanted was the sheets changed. I even showed her the clump of eyelashes and she said she couldn't see anything and where was my magnifying glass. Well maybe she has some eye problems but take a look at my photos and judge for yourself. The woman stormed off uttering rude comments and slammed the gate and the office door- I was shocked! Then I ran into Joyce and tried to explain and she cut me off without so much as an apology and said the maid would come. I again offered to show her the sheets and she went into this rant about how she had never had this kind of complaint before like I was making it up, I then mentioned all the disgusting comments about the hotel on Trip Advisor and she said she never heard of it. Super awkward and leaves a very bad impression. All they had to do was apologize, say it never happens and how wonderful they are and change the sheets immediately and everyone moves on instead of alienate, deny and lie. The other bad thing was that they go against the norm and you cannot cancel and they immediately charge your credit card. By the way they did change the sheets and this time there were only 3 hairs in my bed!

Stayed w/ my husband and a friend. We have stayed there one other time in Nov. 2010 (unit on upper left). During the previous trip we really enjoyed the balcony, which is the main reason we returned, but weather was too cold for the balcony this time. This unit seemed fairly clean w/ the exception of the stained antique chairs and sofa. If I were the owner, I would be embarrassed by this. I didn't even want to sit on them! The unit has a small kitchen w/ frig. and sink, stove top and coffeemaker. We would have appreciated a microwave and some paper towels. The real problem is the bathroom. The shower drains very slowly and the water backs up as you are showering. I do think that the shower in this unit is larger than what I remember in the opposite unit. Okay, now for the issue w/ the sink area of the bathroom. If you a female that needs to do hair and makeup you are not going to like this! Even the two males staying w/ me complained about it! The sink is in a little cutout area, just large enough to house the sink itself. This is hard to explain...should have taken a photo. The mirror is hung on the wall on the left of the sink, but because of the size of the cutout, you can't stand across from the mirror to see into it. There is a plug by the sink but it seems unsafe because the cord from my blow dryer kept falling into the sink and of course you can't see into the mirror while blow drying your hair. How about a mirror on the wall across from you when your facing the sink? The bathroom desperately needs a shelf, there is absolutely nowhere to put any of your toiletries, etc. (this was also a problem in the opposite unit). Possibly make a vanity area elsewhere w/ a good mirror and an outlet close enough so you can at least blow dry your hair. The beds were fairly comfortable although a little firm. Plenty of pillows. Large closet in each bedroom. Although I thought the maid was doing a good job cleaning, we a little issue w/ her. We asked her for towels one day and told her we didn't really need service. She insisted on coming in and at least making the beds, which we agreed to and then went to lunch. We came back about an hour and a half later and were surprised that she was still in there. When she left we realized she had put our razor, shaving cream, toothbrushes, toothpaste, etc back in our suitcase. Some of our friends stuff was in our suitcase and our in his. Our large suitcase was open on a coffee table when we left, but when we returned, she had put \"stuff\" in it, zipped it and stood it up by the closet. This was very strange. We felt a bit violated. We reported this to the owner before we left. I don't think the maid meant any harm, but maybe hadn't been properly trained. One more thing that really bothered my husband...because it was too cold to spend time on balcony, we at least wanted to look out and every time we tried to pull up the mini blinds we had problems! Blinds are cheap, how about updating them. I feel if the owner would spend a night in each of her units (and shower and do her hair and makeup). The changes that need to be made would be very obvious.", "Date": "February 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Galveston", "Title": "\u201cPlease don't waste your money\u201d", "Author": "Chimama1", "ReviewID": "UR121686342", "Content": "Please don't waste your money here.

The rooms take one back in time to the original styles and designs of the 1800's. A real connection to local residents, the 905 is a regular tour stop and the oldest hotel in the French Quarter. My wife and I prefer to stay in the first floor rooms where there is a sitting room with TV, bedroom, bath and kitchen. The kitchen has a stove and refrigerator, sink, coffeemaker, etc. Plus there is a streetside private entrance (very good security system) and a covered balcony area with seating so you can watch passersby. Quaint, cozy, and most of all: ORIGINAL. No plastic remods. Feels like my great Grandmother's place. While there are more luxurious places to stay, if you want the real flavor and eclectic style of N.O. you have to stay here. It just FEELS like New Orleans. The location is one block towards the river from Bourbon Street and smack dab in the middle of everything. Royal street is one of the nicest residential streets in the Quarter and you can walk back to your room and get some peace and quiet whenever you like. The French Quarter is always busy so we bring a small fan to turn on to make some white noise so we can sleep more soundly. Works great. You might not need it at the 905 but it's a necessity it if you stay on or near Bourbon Street, which is very loud all the time. Parking tips: You can park right in front to unload and it's only a couple blocks to the secure riverfront parking area. Plus there are several public parking lots nearby. My strategy is to get there early, unload, and drive around for a while near the hotel. It's not too hard to find a parking place but be careful about where it is. Stay away from corner spots since streets are narrow and delivery trucks don't have the room to turn and they will hit your car. Take note of the signs. Tuesday and Thursday they clean the streets and you can't park in many areas when they do or they will tow your car. Once you find a spot don't move it since everything is walking distance. If you find a good spot and get a ticket it will cost $20, which is cheaper than the daily rate at most parking garages. Even if you don't get a ticket make sure to go online to N.O. traffic ticket site to check your license number for violations. Some local kids think it's funny to take your ticket and throw it away since the fine doubles every month it's not paid. You don't know you got a ticket but your fine is getting bigger.
