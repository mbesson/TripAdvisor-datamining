I could honestly say it is the worst Motel we have stayed in through-out Canada and the US. The continental breakfast consisted of toast and coffee only. Nothing else. No cereal, fruit,muffins or anything else. The electricial system in our room was sub-standard, with most of the electricial outlets not working, and we also lost power completely during the evening. It was very difficult to get the owner to fix the problem, causing much disruption. The walls were paper-thin, and the adjoining tenants were very noisy, and the owner refused to deal with the problem.The internet connection failed after the first day. All in all a most unpleasant experience. Stay here at your peril. Better accomodation available.", "Date": "July 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Saint John, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGood value for the money\u201d", "Author": "wetravel4u", "ReviewID": "UR115283925", "Content": "Based on reviews we read here we booked one night to \"just see\". We did stay a second night. This is a bare bones motel, nothing fancy. The rooms were clean and large. A small refridgerator in the room allowed for drinks to be kept on hand and an in room coffee maker allowed for coffee in the morning. Breakfast was coffee and toast/croissant. The price made the stay worth it. The staff could not have been more helpful. This is not a 5 star hotel, but it is a very good motel.

Our team had booked for a two-night stay. Against our better judgment we did stay the first night. When we attempted to check out after the first night (no way were we sleeping there a second night) the extremely rude lady at the front desk refused to give us a credit for the second night. The two nights were charged immediately upon check-in ensuring that we could not get our money back. The conditions were so deplorable that most families from our group left anyway losing our second night's cost. Rooms in the back section are rented by the hour and obvious sounds from activities taking place in these rooms were heard all night long. The night chambermaid is dressed ready for business. This is not a place for anyone looking for a good night's sleep and definitely NOT a place for children of any age!", "Date": "August 16, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto", "Title": "\u201cHealth hazard\u201d", "Author": "FoxyToronto", "ReviewID": "UR37349934", "Content": "The room had a musty smell, there was mould all over the bathroom ceiling, and the room had no mosquito net at the windows, no microwave or fridge.
