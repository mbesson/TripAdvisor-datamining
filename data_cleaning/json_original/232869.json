Area recommendations The area of the hotel (Via Cicerone) is excellent for sightseeing with Castel D'Angelo, Piazza Navona & the Vatican all within walking distance. What to pack We travelled in November and took mostly warm clothes with a few thinner tops. However, some days the weather was 22 degrees and we could have done with more summer clothes. At the end of the afternoon though the temperature does drop so you do end up needing a jacket/coat. Dining I would definitely recommend the Navona Notte situated on Via del Teatro Pace near to Piazza Navona. The food is excellent, staff very friendly and it is very reasonably priced.

The location is very good, especially if you are going to the Vatican and/or shopping on foot. Just a few minutes to the Vatican or Piazza del Popolo. If your brave enough to watch a movie dubbed in italian there's a huge cinema just a minute away. The neighborhood is relatively quiet with Rome standards. We arrived with taxi because of a late night flight, but you can get here with the Metro and a few hundred meters walk as well. I see from earlier reviews and from the pictures on the website that there are some rooms that are newly refurbished and some older ones. We stayed on the second floor and both the hallway and our room looked brand new. We stayed in a superior room, more then enough space. Good size bath with plenty of towels. Comfortable beds with different pillows. There's some noise from the street in the early evening and when the city wakes up in the morning - but not disturbing during the night. Breakfast was over the ordinary in Rome with a good selection. There's also an assortment of wine/sparkling wine if you would like that for breakfast. There's a buffet / a la carte restaurant at the hotel in the evening with a small selection of dishes - fresh ingredients cooked on the spot. It was very quiet there in end of November - I guess it varies depending on the season. Very relaxing to eat at the hotel when you have walked around Rome the entire day. Both breakfast and dinner are served on the roofterrace. Even in november it's possibly to have breakfast outside - must be amazing in the summer! Check in and check out without problems. The reception and other areas on the first floor are really nice - they even used the fireplace.

Terrible service, unprofessional behaviour and staff tried to rip us off. Here are my reasons: -We arrived to the Hotel at 12pm on a Saturday. We were told to be back by 2pm to have room as i was not ready yet (fair enough). Back at 2:15 pm room was not ready yet and waited another 30m to have keys. When I complained with the lady at reception that room was not avaialable she didn't even try to apologize and tried to convince me that it was not their fault if previous customers left a mess in the room. We had keys of the room at 2:45pm. NOBODY offered to help with our bags (you expect a minimum service from a 4* hotel). When arrived at the floor the corridor was already stinking of cigarette. Opened the door of the room and we immediately realized somebody smoked in the room (the hotel is a non-smoking one). In addition, the room was not a double (as we booked) but a twin room. Went back to reception and complained about the room. Again, no apologies. Lady just told me that somebody must have smoked in the room.. not their fault... Clearly the rooms don't have smoke detectors. We were given another room and managed to have some rest only at 3:30pm. Room was nice but again it was stinking. This time not of cigarette but fried food as windows were open and they have their extractor fan from the kitchen going into the courtyard. - Next morning I went for breakfast at 9:45am (breakfast is from 7:30-10:30). Nice terrace with amazing view. However, buffet was nearly empty (no cakes and pastries were soggy, ham and cheese plates were nearly empty). I sat down expecting a waiter coming to order coffee or tea. After 10 minutes I realized that there was no service at the table for coffee and I should have gone to the bar to ask for it... VERY POOR service again here. NO STAFF to serve at tables in a 4* hotel????? - When I went downstairs to pay for my room, guy at reception clearly tried to rip us off. Our booking and their reservation book clearly stated that our room was EUR 190. When I ask for bill, guy told me : OK, its 210 EUR. I pointed out that we booked for EUR 190 and the guy - AGAIN not even apologizing or looking at me - said \"it's now EUR 190 + 6 eur of some tourism tax. NICE TRY.... People sometimes are not so careful and that's how you make your money???? ALL in ALL, the hotel has nice rooms (although they stink) and nice terrace.

I booked rooms at six different hotels in various locations using their service, and somehow, the reservation I made at the ISA hotel was confirmed at a NON-REFUNDABLE rate. Since my business plans were evolving, I made certain that all reservations could be canceled without a fee (within the given time frame), and when I noticed that the confirmation indicated that for this one hotel it was non-refundable I immediately called Booking.com AND the Hotel directly to inform them of the computer error (the reservation was for a stay two months in advance of the date i booked). I was assured by both the ISA hotel and Booking.com that I would not be charged and that I could rebook reservation as a non-refundable stay. Two days later I noticed the charge on my account - over $900 for a four day stay. I also received a cancellation notice from Booking.com - so now I paid $900 for a non-existent reservation. For two months, I traded emails and telephone calls with the Isa Hotel and Booking.com, each time I was told that the refund would post to my account within a few days. As time passed, I began cancelling all other reservations with Booking.com and re-booked those stays either directly through the hotels (these services don't offer discounts, but the hotels will if you book directly through them), or I used Hotels.com. I also visited the hotel directly on July 3 when I was in Rome (staying somewhere else obviously since I didn't have an existing reservation at a place I already paid for). The front desk person was very unhelpful and said that the manager was unavailable and that they were not required to provide a refund. This was followed up with a final email from the hotel (and another from Booking.com) completely reversing their previous indication that they would provide the refund. I did my best to rectify a computer error immediately after it occurred (which I do not believe was made by me), and yet, I was given the run around for two months, with lies and deceit. I plan to continue to flood the various hotel review sites with bad reviews for this hotel in return for their nasty and frankly immoral treatment. I tried to resolve this matter in a dignified and reasonable manner, but the hotel has no real business sense.

There is plently of room except perhaps travelling with an oversized suitcase. The biggest drawback with the hotel is its small elevator. We had a group of 8 people and it took three trips up and down to get people and their bags to the 4th floor. We walked the stairs most of the time. There isn't a swimming pool but there is so much to do in Rome and the kids didn't even mention that there wasn't a pool--they usually do--that it is not a concern.

I chose the Isa after a long search due to mostly good reviews at Trip Advisor but was a bit nervous after reading some. However, the gorgeous roof terrace and the central location looked good so I booked. Arrived mid-day and was quickly given our room. I braced myself to see if it was old or new (told couldn't move anyway as the hotel was booked) and didn't get cheapest choice to try and avoid the old, but sure enough, we walked into an old room and felt like it was Athens circa 1990---complete with atrocious hose hairdryer. I cannot understand in 2011 to have a 70s hairdryer that 1) took 15 minutes to dry shoulder length hair and 2) was scorching hot to hold after 5min. The room itself was spotless and put together, the bathroom good size but the old small room is huge contrast to the modern rooms advertised online and the sharp looking lobby. We also got twin beds (no way to push together and room too small for a double) so overall for Euro238/night it was a huge letdown. So much for a romantic weekend in single beds and if I was coming from overseas or on my honeymoon would be very angry. The restaurant dinner and breakfast buffets were very good (although my dinner steak was inedible shoe leather after I asked for med-rare) but the pasta during the same meal was outstanding. Go figure. The May weather was fantastic to enjoy the really great terrace so it took the edge off the disappointing room. That said, without air-conditioning in the room, I don't think I'd book during summer. Perhaps the new rooms have aircon, but ours didn't and at nearly 27C/80F already in May, it was borderline too warm. The window was open all night and the street noise was not too bad (but I lived in Mumbai and can sleep through incessant honking), but beware. The service was good and the daytime desk crew all quick, helpful, friendly and perfect English speakers. The waiters and housekeeping also were quality. The location of the hotel is good for Vatican, but no way is it a 10 minute walk to the Spanish Steps. More like 20+. It's 10 minutes to the foot of Ponte Umberto if you're speed walking and maybe a good 5 more to Piazza Navonna. Also be prepared to walk back to the hotel in the evening because all 3 nights it was impossible to get a taxi from anywhere (all full). The last night, we arrived at the hotel at 2am after getting lost from Campo di Fiori and after 35 minutes of walking then spent 10 minutes banging on the hotel door which was barred closed, ringing the buzzer and calling (an international call) the front desk to no answer. My husband ultimately forced the doors open and the night staffer came around the corner with a newspaper probably after hearing the loud CLANG of the metal brace on the doors hitting the marble floor. Not fun. I'm sure it was a one-off, but very aggravating so late and not knowing what we'd do if we couldn't get in. Was he sleeping? We took the train (and metro then walked) from the airport when we arrived, but got the 45euro hotel arranged car back to Fiumicino.

On arrival we were met by a man called Walter at reception, his attitude was not exactly welcoming, he demanded our passports and basically threw the keys at us. We were put on the fourth floor, the lift is tiny and very old fashioned, we struggled to get to the room and when we did we discovered a double bed in a somewhat dark room with what looked like a sofa in the corner. I went back to reception and the same man literally shrugged his shoulders, there were no other rooms,and tried to persuade me that the sofa was a bed. I pointed out that it had no bedlinen on it, or pillow, and asked to speak to the manager. He claimed he was in charge, which I subsequently discovered was a lie. He eventually gave us another room on the second floor. He did not offer us help with our bags and he did not apologise for the mistake. We took this other room which was much smaller and even darker than the original room, but at least it had twin beds . He did not tell us that there was building work going on next door, that there was a scaffold right outside our room, or that we would hear noise from the kitchen staff as they smoked in the courtyard and chatted late at night. We could also hear the person above us very clearly as the ceiling was very thin, and we could hear noise from reception. Basically he gave us the room from hell, and based on his attitude afterwards he seemed to have done it deliberately because we had complained. When my mother complained again she was told that her comments had been noted and someone would get back to her. No one got back to her, we spent three nights listening to the noise, and our days trying to enjoy Rome but exhausted from lack of sleep.

But be careful that you get what you think you are booking and paying for!\u201d", "Author": "LibbyK-001", "ReviewID": "UR97397333", "Content": "On the positive: A very clean hotel. Good location in a nice area - you can walk everywhere! Buffet breakfast was fantastic and well worth the money. Staff were friendly and spoke excellent English. On the downside: There was a smell in lift area which remained throughout our stay. Very noisy at night if staying on 2nd floor (The 5th floor was not as bad). We had problems with the service desk regarding our reservation which unfortunately ruined our 3 night romantic stay. We booked an exclusive double for 3 nights back in November (3.5 months in advance) for our anniversary. On arrival we didn't think we got an exclusive room and when we asked about it we were fobbed off and told that we have been given one of their newer exclusive rooms. The room we were given was nice (Room 204) but was about 1/2 the size that it was meant to be and didn't have a balcony. It was newly decorated with a jacuzzi that was in the separate bathroom located down a hallway. It wasn't however a patch on the larger 'luxury' room with jacuzzi located within in the bedroom (Room 509) and balcony that we thought we were going to get for our romantic long weekend. We were charged the same price (276 Euros a night) for this smaller room. I'd have felt it was more a superior room and 180-200 Euros would have been a more appropriate pricing for it. After complaining again a little later in the day we were offered a 'deal' to move into one of the rooms we'd actually thought we'd booked. But the deal was that we could have the room for 1 night only and not the 2 that we had remaining. So each night of our stay we'd be spending in a different room.... What the????? Yes we would have to move again the following morning but this time into a (downgraded) superior double with no jacuzzi. This is because they wanted to give the room we had to someone else for valentine's day and all other exclusive rooms were taken. No consideration was given to our actual booking, our holiday and experience at their hotel. It was just expected that we'd happy pack and unpack each night. We booked 3.5 months ahead and our reservation had comments on what we wanted and that it was for our anniversary. Our booking was accepted by them and yet we were made to feel like they were doing us a huge favour by letting us stay in an exclusive room at all. After complaining again we were allowed to stay in the 2nd room we had been moved into for the remaining 2 nights. The room was as luxurious as I had expected it would be but it was also a little tired ie: it had an older style decor. Our stay may just be one of those unfortunate and bad luck things that happen from time to time but if asked the question - would I spend 3 x 276 Euros a night again on what we got from a service, physical room and most importantly 'experience' point of view - no way in the world.

It is located on the left bank of the river and is only a 5 minute walk to the Vatican and St. Peters. The city centre is very compact so we were still only 15 minutes walk from Piazza Navona and all the surrounding sites, shops and restaurants. The hotel itself has been refurbished recently and it makes a good first impressions on arrival. We were greeted by the smiling Fabio who was very helpful during our stay. We chose one of their family rooms which is essentially 2 rooms that are annexed off the central stair and lift and overlook an internal courtyard making them very quiet. The rooms are quite small (although I think that most rooms in Rome are) but they were very comfortable and clean. Flat screen TV with lots of Sky channels and free and instant broadband were useful too. Each had bathrooms with showers. We had tried to book one with a bath but it is not an option. We stayed in late October so the tempretaure of the rooms were good and we didn't have to use the air conditioning. One of the best features of the hotel is the rooftop terrace that looks over to the dome of St. Peter's Basilica. This is the perfect spot for a pre dinner drink as the sun goes down and the lights of Rome begin to switch on. The bar and restaurant are supervised by the tireless and wonderful Willy who looked after us very well. We didn' t choose to dine in the hotel restaurant despite the location as it never looked as if it was going to be that busy. Perhaps it is different in the summer. We did use it for breakfast however which was excellent. It had a great choice including fresh fruit, cooked to order eggs, breads, meats, cereals and even a glass of Prosecco if you wished. The public spaces on the ground floor by reception were really only used as waiting areas rather than a place to relax. Given the poor exchange rate against the \u00a3 then most hotels are very expensive so I was pleasantly surprised at the room rate which included breakfast for our 3 nnight stay.

We had read the reviews and the place sounded ideal. In all fairness, it was fine for what we wanted as we hadn't planned on staying too long in the hotel itself. We walked everywhere from there but it certainly not a central hotel and making your way over to the bridge to get to Piazza Navona is a little hazardous given the traffic zooming around Piazza Cavour. The receptionist who checked us out was friendly enough but the chap who was there for most of the time was pretty grimfaced and didn't respond to any greeting - preferring to look the other way. For much of the stay there was a fairly revolting smell around the reception area but as noone else has mentioned this, I guess that it is temporary. It certainly put me off using the computer in the lobby as I couldn't hold my breath for that long! The lift was ancient and a little temperamental but this wasn't really too much of any issue. Our room was spotless and, whilst it was on the small side, it was perfectly adequate. The air con was a little feeble and, on the first night, we assumed that it was not available as the windows were open when we arrived in the room. We therefore kept the window open - Big Mistake! The road was incredibly noisy and we hardly slept until we shut the window. Once shut, the soundproofing was not too bad. The cleaner showed us how to work the air con the following morning so the following nights were much better. The views from the breakfast terrace are great. We stuck to prosecco and water as the juices were synthetic. I would also recommend asking the waiter for a cappucino or espresso as the coffee provided for you to help yourself is quite stewed and strong. It is very much a case of help yourself at breakfast - I guess we are used to waiters showing us to a table and explaining where things are but this is not something that happens at Isa.

They also have a computer to use in the lobby with free internet-standing use only so noone stays on it too long. Take ear-plugs, if you need quiet.

After we booked using Expedia I emailed the hotel and requested a decent room or an upgrade due to the fact that this option was unavailable online through the website. When we arrived were booked into Room 407 (the honeymoon suite as they call it) - my wife and I were pleasantly surprised at how basic yet suitable this room was after the horror stories we read online (both at the Hotel Isa and in Europe in general). The room was on the fourth floor, up the old fashioned elevator, and just to the right. Outside we had a view of an urban/residential street that was quiet most of the time at this elevation - with the exception of the trash trucks early one morning. (Remember you are in one of the world's largest cities - not Utopia - there will be things that aren't totally perfect). Keep remembering this and you'll be fine. The room had a smaller feel but being forwarned online, there was enough room for the both of us. The bathroom was very tiny, about the size of a cruise ship bathroom - but again this is the norm for Europe - so we have been told. I would, again, recommend this hotel to people if they keep an open mind. It WAS clean at all times. The service was spotty and by this I mean it depends on who you were dealing with. The front desk, when manned by Fabio - I think that's his name (a middle aged man with colorful designer glasses) was VERY helpful. He was EXTREMELY helpful and worth the reference. Most other times the service was adequate with one exception. There was a much younger individual who, when asked for dinner recommendations and help for a reservation, was horrendous. When asked for a NICE & pricey spot for a \"memorable last dinner in Rome\" he recommended touristy or not so memorable spots. He said he was new to town and again was barely offering help even when it was drug out of him. We finally settled on Casa Bleve (after some research online using the free internet/computer station in the lobby - BOY WE LUCKED OUT!!! This place was awesome) - pricey, but good food, great wine list, Roman through and through - a highlight of our trip - it was even Michelin rated. We highly recommend this place as a last night/anniversary/memorable spot for dinner. The housekeeping service was impeccible. And the breakfast upstairs (we never ate dinner at the hotel) on the roofdeck was the perfect way to start each day. The food was typical Italian/Roman with OJ, Pineapple Juice, meats, cheeses, pastries, fruits and an Omelette bar. All of which was a perfect and FREE way to start the day!! The hotel was in a GREAT location for walkers. We WALKED EVERYWHERE!! Twice we walked all the way down to the Colosseum using the Via Del Corso. Great dining, shopping, the Vatican, and historic sites were all within walking distance for the two of us in our early 30s. If you are impaired or not a walker - I'd think about about staying somewhere else - but we wanted to take Rome in - and WE DID!! Everyday walking over or along the Tiber going to the Vatican or into the \"touristy/historic\" parts of the city. I'll finish with a few tips that we found worthwhile and a few we added ourselves for you. -Dine at Casa Bleve (Via del Teatro Valle, 49, 00186 Roma, Italia 066 865970) -Tartufo at Tre Scalini in the Piazza Navonna. A PHENOMENAL dessert. Although it is touristy it is absolutely worth it! -Dinner at the Piazza de la Rotunda, we did this a few nights. There are a few spots right next to the Pantheon. Decent food and a GREAT view! We did this on our first night. It was a short walk and a nice way to start the trip. -We found this tip beforehand. When going to the Colosseum/Forum. Get the Romapass from the Tabacchi station just outside the Colosseum Metro Station (it is extremely easy to find - coming from Historic Rome it'll be on your left when facing the Colosseum). It saves you money and time!! -Taxis are not as expensive as Philadelphia (where we live), NYC or DC. Use them if you need to. -You HAVE to go see the Vatican and The Sistine Chapel (Cappela Sistina). BUT get a tour guide. We waited over an hour to get in - and that was SHORT - thanks to a tour guide. It woulda been at least a three hour wait otherwise. OH - and don't go to The Vatican on a Monday. The crowds were killers! -See the many churches!! They are museums in and of themselves. Some we love and recommend - do some research and think about them: - -Santa Maria della Vittoria (the only Gothic church in Rome - beautiful and right next to the Pantheon), - -St Peter in Chains (San Pietro in Vincoli), which holds two sets of chains that were supposedly placed on St Peter himself. - -San Giovanni in Laterano, which is next to \"The Holy Steps\" which Jesus climbed to meet Pontius Pilate. - -The Capuchin Crypt. An old crypt that holds the bones of over 4,000 monks. Plus we get the name Cappuccino from there. We recommend you look these up and do your research. All of the churches, like St. Peter in Chains even have Michelangelo statues in them - as though the chains weren't enough. Crazy and just beautiful - all of these places!! But be warned of the down times. From roughly noon/1pm to 3pm-ish the churches close. So make sure you know what the hours are before you get there. -If you get the chance, do the Audience with the Pope. We actually were lucky enough to get into the \"Newlywed Section\" (you get this by applying to the Bishops' Office for US Visitors to the Vatican) and were VERY close to the Pope. This was about an hour to two hour engagement. But if you sit in the crowd you can leave at anytime. Arrive early - we were there around 7:30 or 8am to get a good seat even in the reserved section. Do this in the general seating and you'll have good spot to see the Pope pass by both times in his Popemobile. -We wanted to hit an American bar and watch some sports - just as a side diversion for a drink or two and found an AWESOME one - even though it was hard to find. Highlander Pub at Vicolo di San Biagio, 9, 00186 Rome. VERY friendly to Americans and a great place to watch some games (we were there during the Stanley Cup playoffs and wanted to watch part of a Flyers game). -We booked a wine tasting/food tour through Presto Tours (\"Wine Tasting in 2 Rome Enotecas\") and were lucky enough to get Ettore. He was AWESOME!! He took us around and completely broke Rome down for us. The tour was supposed to last three hours but we spent five just chatting, learning about wine, food and life in general in Rome. Just a GREAT evening! -When booking the Hotel Isa email them ahead of time and request a private driver. For two people it is only 50 Euro and they will pick you up AT the airport in a private Mercedes and drive you straight to the hotel. I recommend this over a cab ride! -Finally I was told that if you have an overnight flight from the States you will be tired when you hit Rome. FIGHT the urge to nap or you will put the rest of the trip behind the 8 Ball. Instead an easy way to keep occupied and awake is go on a \"touristy\" Double Decker bus tour. They are reletively inexpensive and you see all the sights. This will give you an idea of where things are BEFORE you go out on foot later in the week. You can find these busses right in front of the Vatican - just a ten minute walk from the Hotel Isa. So get on the bus, go grab lunch, take a short nap and then hit dinner (maybe at the Piazza de la Rotunda??). -We made the mistake of eating lunch outside of the Vatican that first day. Fight the urge and eat around the Hotel. The food is less pricey and a little bit less touristy. It is a better meal and worth your while! -Go to the Spanish Steps - day AND night . Rome is a city where you can drink alcohol on the streets. Our first night there was a food/drink cart at the top of the steps and we grabbed some beers and sat on the Steps just relaxing and enjoying the Roman air. We went back later in the week and the cart was gone. But that can't stop you from bringing your own beer/wine and taking it all in - preferrably at night. Amazing!! Overall - ROME IS AMAZING!!! This is just a general guide and only a sliver of what we recommend and experience. Feel free to email and request info or run an idea past us! You will love Rome. Also - try the Hotel Isa. Request room 407 and you'll be fine. Keep expectations low and you'll be fine. Remember you are in Rome... ... ...and you'll be fine!

From the hotel, it is an easy walk to the Vatican, the Spanish Steps, the Pantheon, Piazza Novana, Trevi Fountain, etc. Even in 90 degree plus heat, we found the walks rather easy, and besides, after eating all the great food Rome has to offer you will need to walk it off. Additionally, the hotel is easily accessible yet it is located in a quiet neighborhood away from all tourism traffic. Very good shopping three blocks away all along Via Coladi Rienzo.

The breakfast buffet on the rooftop was the best, sparkling wine, hot food as well as cold food, and fresh squeezed juices. Apparently breakfast is included at all the Italian hotels we stayed at. WARNING: Don't eat at the hotel for dinner, the buffet was awful. Maybe it was because we booked the New Year's Eve dinner buffet (which cost $10 more than usual, came out to $70/person not including drinks). It was mostly h'orderves and cold dishes. The chef would bring out steaming piles of mussels and pasta and fish to the other tables, but for some reason my wife and I were completely neglected. There was another young couple that was completely neglected as well and seemed frustrated with the lack of service. The service was mainly catering towards a large party at our expense. Maybe it's because we didn't order their overpriced bottles of wine. We eventually left the buffet completely unsatisfied, went down to the lobby to complain about the poor service, and was told they would look into it. We never heard back and didn't get an apology, then again we didn't really expect to hear back. Completely ruined our NYE experience in Rome.

Champagne/sparkling wine is left on the centre table for you to serve yourself.

Other reviews are right in that you do not get tea/coffee facilities so if you do like a brew in your room, take a travel kettle. The hotel's best feature is the rooftop terrace. We had champagne breakfast each morning which offered the usual pastries, cereals, omelettes made by the chef. It is fairly ideally located, however the local piazza was undergoing renovation so we felt the local area rather quiet.

We were not as impressed as we expected to be. The first room we were shown on the 3rd floor (310) was mock Roman villa shabby chic with the emphasis on shabby most of which was not deliberate. Additionally there was hardly any storage apart from a small wardrobe with a hole cut in the floor for longer items and no drawers or closed cupboards - inadequate for five nights in a sophisticated city. To be fair to the hotel when we asked if another room was available they immediately found us another on the re-furbished 2nd Floor at the same price and stated that room 310 was not one of those that was usually complained about! Room 204 was much improved with modern fittings and excellent bathroom. However it was facing the street and therefore very noisy. This is a very expensive hotel considering its star rating and facilities. Our next trip includes a stay at a Mandarin Oriental, which is less expensive surprisingly. Our specific concerns apart from cost which may be down to the prevailing market in Rome, were:- we had to request Bathrobes and slippers which were supposed to be available, we had no price list for the mini bar, broken window in our bedroom, noisy main road location, very limited breakfast choice unless you have a taste for cold scrambled eggs and sausages or hard boiled eggs floating in water, disinterested staff ( although Fatima, our room attendant was very good and it was obvious when it was her day off!) No hooks for bathrobes so these were place daily on top of the towel rail and it was necessary to climb on the bath to retrieve them, lift often in use by delivery staff to the breakfast terrace or decorators and therefore not always available to guests. No catering facilities apart from breakfast and not even tea or coffee making facilities in the room. Some reception staff suddenly found English difficult to understand if a problem they were asked to deal with became too demanding. Our example was trying to get a taxi booked to take us to the train station but during the time that took of nearly 40 minutes there were several others who were raising problems such as a superior room they had booked weeks before had been double booked and no longer available, a guest whose key would not work (again) and a couple who had booked the hotels airport shuttle getting agitated as it had not turned up at the agreed time. Eventually I hailed a taxi myself outside although it is illegal in Rome for taxi drivers to stop for fares but as the receptionist herself stated \"this is Italy, so no comment\" The positive aspect of the hotel is its position 10 minutes walking from The Vatican and castle and near to Cavour bridge to cross the river. It is quite possible to walk to The Colloseum in around 30 minutes, the Trevi Fountain in 20 minutes and 15 minutes to Spanish Steps. A word of warning to visitors to Rome for the first time, as we were. It is very easy to be ripped off by Taxi Drivers and in Restaurants. We were quoted 25 Euros from Termini Station to the Hotel, which we accepted. The return trip took far longer due to traffic conditions but was only 15 Euros - why? We stopped for coffee and a pastry at a cafe approaching Vatican City. Coffee was said to be 1.50 Euros on a list over the counter and Gateaux 5 Euros - total Euros13 .We were asked if we would like to sit down and they would bring it outside to us. The bill came to 34 Euros. 21 Euros was because we had decided to eat on the premises and a service charge for waiter service. Beware too of Romans bearing gifts in Restaurants. The \"complimentary\" bread or Bruscetta or vegetables they so charmingly serve with the compliments of the chef are anything but complimentary and can add significantly to the bill. We have learned that this practise has been outlawed by the Italian Government but still persists everywhere, and we don't complain do we because we are not comfortable with the language nor like to make a scene Would not use the Isa again but the sights ( but not sounds - the worst traffic in Europe?) of Rome are wonderful and the City is well worth a visit", "Date": "October 13, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Honolulu", "Title": "\u201cGreat find...would stay here again!\u201d", "Author": "Rocky50", "ReviewID": "UR10056717", "Content": "We Arrived in late September and checked-out in early October 2007.

We had room 310 and noted the bathroom was about more than twice the size of the other hotel from the first night. - Breakfast buffet.

Second, the room they put us in was a tiny room with a hall as the sleeping area. There were two beds butted end to end, separated by a counter top (or stationary night stand). I had emailed the hotel before and asked them for a nice room, since we were celebrating our 25th anniversary. Needless to say, this arrangement did not suit the request or what we paid for. I went to the front desk and told them of the room problem. They said they were sorry, but they were full and they would move us the next day, to a room with a king bed. They offered no compensation or anything else for our inconvience, other than a \"sorry\". They did move us the next day, but the room was only a little bigger and the \"king bed\" was two beds pushed together. The small balcony looked into the inside of the building, which was nothing more than four walls and windows. The hotel was in a good location, about a 10 minute walk to the Vatican and 10 minutes to Pizza Navona.

Frequently they ran out of bread, cereal bowls etc. This was every morning! There is no bar at the hotel and no food served after breakfast. Although the hotel was clean and in an excelent location for St. Peters and the Vatican City. I would not stay at the Hotel Isa again.

Was pleasantly surprised by the hotel. We had room 500 on the fifth floor for \u20ac150. The bathroom was very impressive for this price range in Rome big, cleanand new. The room needed a fresh coat of paint and somebody with a bit more esthetic sense, but it was quiet until the morning when some guest's kid strarted whining. Still the bed was wide and comfy and the French windows opened to a cute little balcony facing the internal courtyard. The best selling point of the hotel for us though was the roofterrace, where on two blue sky, sun-drenched Rome mornings we enjoyed great breakfasts--excellent capuccinos, fresh fruits, omellettes, parma ham, etc. with a full view of St Peter's dome. No better way to kick off you day in Rome! Location was a plus being close to p. Cavour, v. Cola de Rienzo, p. Navona, and the metro station. Staff were helpful when my girlfriend lost her passport and they directed us to the nearest police station and rang up the embassy to get info on replacement. All in all, good value for money in peak season Rome accomodation. Wouldn't mind staying there again.", "Date": "October 19, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bristol England", "Title": "\u201cNot Impressed\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3997831", "Content": "I was very disappointed with my room - the room number was hanging off the door, the bathroom was dirty, the toilet seat was broken and it looked nothing like the rooms shown on the Internet.

After seeing the hotels\u2019 website I assumed I\u2019d get a room similar to those depicted, how wrong can you be!....The rooms on the 2nd floor look nothing like they do on the website. After having paid a fair amount for the room, I assumed I would get something half decent. On arrival I was allocated a room with a twin bed, when I had booked a double. The door number hanging off the room door was a sign of things to come!...If you are unlucky enough to end up on the 2nd floor the rooms are in serious need of updating and can only been described as a bit grubby and dirty. All the rooms are meant to be non smoking, but this rule is clearly not adhered too. Breakfast was due to finish at 10.30 each morning, however on arrival at 9.30 for breakfast, there was little food left and the stock was not replenished.
