I will have to say the stay was most pleasant. The rooftop bar was astounding with exquisite views. The room was very comfortable We were above the restaurant so we could hear the patrons with the window open but it was really no problem. Just closed the window. Bed was most excellent and there was a real closet to hang clothes in. The only thing lacking was a TV Guide but nobody provides that. Always wonder about that. Would be nice if that was provide at hotels as usually I am in a new town and have no idea of scheduling and if you have to wait for the roll around on the TV, by the time you view 200 channels whatever you have chosen to view is 1/2 over. The restaurant however left something to be desired. Although most of the food was pretty good there were some odd things. Ceviche was excellent. Ordered some taco's, never had a taco on a 3'' diameter tortilla before. The beans tasted as if they came from a can. A quesedilla with pulled pork was also served on same 3'' corn tortilla. Almost ordered chicharron. I've lived in the southwest for about 40 years. Chicharron is fried pork skin, not a ''cheese crisp'', which is really a quesedilla. Glad I read the ''fine print''. Steak and eggs for breakfast was excellent. Service was very friendly and efficient in both the restaurant and the hotel My main beef with this hotel is the ''add-on'' charges. The resort fee of $20 raised the price 25%. The room was worth the extra 20 bucks, I just resent the misrepresentation of the price of the room. If the cost of the room is really 100 bucks tell me. Don't try to sneak it in there as an add-onn ''resort'' charge. The other charge I found absolutely intolerable was a 5% property tax charge. This is the first time in my life I have seen a ''property tax'' added to my bill I have stayed in hotels from San Diego to Seattle To Maine to Florida and most states in between and have never encountered this. To tell the truth I refused to pay this just on a matter of principle. Unfortunately, or maybe fortunately my wife changed my mind for me. I as actually pleased with the overall stay and really have no complaint with the price, only the sneaky way they got there. The extra 5% tax thing however is completely unfair in my opinion. And I will think twice before I stay there again. I will have to admit I am a child of the 60's and will stand on priciple all day. So in the end I had a very nice stay and if you don't care about such things by all means i would reccomend a stay at the Clarendon and I will most likely be outvoted by my wife the next time we stay in Phoenix. It is way more fun than say one of the Hiltons or other chain hotels.", "Date": "April 10, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Whidbey Island, Washington", "Title": "\u201cAmenities are better than the rooms, I am just not hip enough.\u201d", "Author": "Sb360", "ReviewID": "UR127605397", "Content": "Everything was just a little off making me feel a little more dip-ster than hipster.

Also, the \"fitness center\" is a complete joke. The treadmill literally stopped working while my girlfriend was running on it. They have some dumbbells but no bench or anything to sit on. Also, the insulation is very poor. We were on the 4th floor and could hear people on the street below as if they were right next to the window.

There are a lot of very good things about this property - the pool (albeit unheated), the rooftop deck, gallo blanco, the front desk staff, the complimentary late night munchie bar and free coffee and water in the rooms. However - the main part of staying at a hotel in my opinion *are* the quality of the rooms and unfortunately our room did not match the quality of this beautiful property. 1. Our sink was becoming detached from the wall. Seriously, it was so awkward and I was afraid to put any weight whatsoever on it. 2. The conditioner dispenser was broken. 3. The room's baseboard was peeling/detached from the wall. 4. The walls were so paper thin we could hear the housekeeping staff going from room to room, doors slamming all the time and music from the pool. It was difficult to sleep at all (even trying to sleep in) because of all the exterior noise. I really, really wanted to like this place especially since it's a local business but I can't go back or recommend it to anyone. I would definitely recommend the property for an event -- just not the rooms. We had one more groupon to use on a future visit and I ended up calling groupon and getting a refund.

(For one thing, I was born in the '50s, so been there, done that.) This hotel seems to have been created from a 1960s-era apartment building -- everything (including guest room walls) are plaster and cement, and there's a big pool in the middle of the complex. The decor is pretty amazing -- very attractive and unusual and retro -- but it affected the livability of the room. My room was REALLY dark, depressingly dark, had-to-use-a-flashlight-to-read-in-bed dark. Lighting was not adequate, and the deep blue painted plaster walls made it gloomy and creepy. There were several small annoying maintenance issues -- broken switch on lamp, burned-out bulb on another lamp -- and little signs of wear that just made it more depressing. It was clean but not immaculate. Good: the mattress and bedding were plush and comfortable. Bad: the bedding and towels had little stains on them -- I knew they were clean, but the effect was icky. Location: it could be considered close to the light rail, but only relative to the rest of Phoenix: when you're pulling a rolling suitcase behind you, it's kind of a slog to the light-rail station. Also, it seemed on the edge of some kind of industrial area, and trucks started waking me up at 5 AM.

You can use the light rail to get to and from Sky Harbor Airport as well as to and from downtown Phoenix, and downtown Scottsdale (bar district, ballpark, etc.) is about a 20.00 cab ride. HOTEL/ROOMS Do not let the outside of the hotel or reviews referring to \"cinder block\" room discourage you from staying here as it almost did for me. The rooms and the entire hotel is decorated with a minimalist/modern, but very hip flair. There is very cool art throughout the entire hotel as well. The rooms are clean, the beds are comfortable, the decor is nice, and the technology is up-to-date. My room had a nice flat screen TV, an Apple friendly radio alarm clock with docking/charging stand, free water bottles, and a view of the main attraction - the pool. Get a view of the pool it is worth the extra dollars - there is a cool waterfall feature that run the entire length of the wall, and there is generally a buzz about the pool area. There is a 100 person jacuzzi (really like a small pool) that is popular as well. Free strong WiFi signal is also available throughout the entire hotel premises. My only complaint about my room (329) is that the window shade was missing the pull chain, so I couldn't open it to let the full light in. THE SCENE / NIGHTLIFE Not much happens in Central Phoenix - especially on week nights, but if it is happening it is probably at the Clarendon. The hotel has a small bar area that is located adjacent to a very popular restaurant also located near the hotel lobby area. The scene is a mixture of happy hour crowd - young and old, as well as patrons waiting for tables at the restaurant, and locals. I highly recommend Wednesday evenings to catch the weekly Mexican band / dancing display show, That isn't the right term for it, but it is a huge draw and the place was packed to see it. Fun to watch and listen to. SERVICE I found all of the staff from front desk to restaurant/bar to be excellent, but then again I generally try not to be a jerk when I am dealing service staff.

I loved this hotel! It is so much better than the standard cookie cutter hotels- (of which I had to move to one for my conference). I was dreading the move. I booked through a third party site after reading the reviews. First of all the lobby is wonderful as is the front desk staff- My room was not ready so I grabbed a YUMMY lunch in the restaurant. After finishing, the room was still not done so I just read while I waited. Not a big deal! Since I had to wait, the offered my an upgrade which I gladly took! I had a corner suite and it was awesome. Fridge, Kuerig, Sound Machine(which was so appreciated since I use one at home), desk area, and nice bed. There were SOME area that were not vacuumed in the corners and could have wiped down a bit more but overall, I was very satisfied. The pool area is awesome. I wanted a few days to chill out, catch up on books, and relax in the sun. The pool chairs are so comfy, the environment is so \"chill\". Loved the music. In the afternoon, they would bring out bottled water and otter pops which was a fabulous treat and nice touch! They did not leave me any new toiletries(philosophy products!!) so I called and they brought me some. I also noticed that my K-cups were not filled. Again, no biggie, I went down and picked out which ones I wanted. I also had leftovers from my fabulous lunch the day before and requested (on a whim) a microwave. Delivered. Since it was just me, I knew I would have more leftovers. It was great to have since I ordered pizza that evening. The food at the hotel is awesome by the way! The only complaint I would have would be on the taxi service they use. I went shopping and the taxi charged me $6 more than the other one from the mall. I did see the driver upon departing the hotel give cash to the gentleman who order me the taxi. Bothersome. I just called another taxi service from the mall and used him the rest of the trip. There were some internet problems in my area and when i was working poolside on my laptop for a signal(not a bad office), the owner came over and asked me about my internet and what room I was in and what issues there were. He informed me they were working on the problem. It was done that evening. Again not a big deal since there was a signal I could use by the pool. The $20 fee was no big deal- I did not have a car for parking but you also get the bottled water in your room, internet(which per day at the hotel I moved to was-$13 for internet for 24 hrs and $6 bottle water). You also get the awesome k cups and snacks in the evening. The other hotel had the awful cheap coffee makers with 1 powder creamer packet. The rooms there were $225 per night for JUST A ROOM. If you want a 5 star hotel with the same great price as The Clarendon with all the same great amenities, let me now where you find that. Some people go into a hotel on a 3 star budget with 5 star expectations. This place is great for the price and for what you get! A hotel with personality and pizazz! Read all the positive reviews because they are spot on. There was a photo shoot going on while I was there. The hotel is very cool and I find it an honor to have been staying where people want to have a photo shoot. If you don't like what you see- don't look. I would stay here again and hope to in the future with my husband and daughter. If you want to get around in town-rent a car. Not a LOT to do around the hotel.

Unfortunately, it just didn't measure up to our expectations. The positives: comfortable bed and a really cool hotel concept. The restaurant was so good, though I can't tell how associated it is with the hotel (We were told we couldn't charge food to our room). The staff was friendly and polite. There were so many negatives for us. First off- housekeeping. We came back from our second day and the bed was half made. The sheets were made up, but the blanket was half on a chair and half on the floor. The blanket and sheets had brown (what looked like rust) stains on both. We loved the Keurig machine in the room and used it daily- but the containers were never refilled, so we ran out of coffee. Likewise with the bath products- we used up the small lotion container/hand soap on the first day and didn't get more. Overall, we felt like the housekeeping was just shoddy- we didn't make a huge mess, but aside from towels and water being replaced, and bed being (mostly) made, nothing was neatened up. We closed the window screen (actually a piece of art that slides over) so people couldn't see into our room from the breezeway. When we returned to the room each day, the art was pushed over again, so anyone could see our valuables sitting out. Second, the location is just not what we thought it would be. From the website, you feel like you're in the middle of it all. It isn't. We prefer to walk/use public transport when we travel. After one night of walking around by the Clarendon, we headed back to the airport to get a rental car- an unexpected expense :( The area directly around the hotel includes some not-so-great abandoned lots, and neighborhoods. Fine during the day, but not at night. We also found it to be about a half-mile to the light rail. Also, it just isn't what it promises. The roof deck is pretty, and we were told it serves drinks on Fri/Sundays on the bar up there. We went up on Sunday- nothing going on, no one up there. There were a bunch of leftover food/drinks that hadn't been cleared-- maybe from Fri night? The pool is pretty too- we tried to go in the hot tub Saturday night and it was cold. We were told it was broken and they were \"working on it\" but after sitting in there for a good half hour, we gave up. Other families there told us it was broken Friday night as well. There were certain things that didn't bother us, but I felt might have bothered lighter sleepers. Our room had a glass-front mini-bar (with nothing in it), with a bright light that stayed on all night. We couldn't figure out how to turn the light off without unplugging the mini bar, so we slept with it on. Silly, since there is no mini bar service. Also we faced the inner courtyard/pool and the noise was pretty bad. We heard kids playing/yelling in the pool at 6:30/7 a.m. after adults had been out there partying until 12ish. Also, don't expect to have the pool area be a relaxing spot- we saw 3 separate photo shoots happening while we were there- engagement shoots, modeling shoots, etc. Photographers with equipment using sunbeds,etc. I don't think the shoots were for hotel guests, but not positive. There were other little frustrating details too- we couldn't find info on the website that said what time checkout was. We tried to call down to the front desk, and the phone didn't have an option like that. Our room smelled funny- we wondered if the bottle of febreze in the room was to cover up a smell? When we tried to go to the pool/ hot tub, we were told they were out of towels and had to wait for someone to bring some out. The price just seemed really excessive for what you get. We are now staying at a beautiful hotel in Scottsdale, in a great walking area, for significantly less (and no, no $20 a night parking/internet fee).

At first I thought I might book the hotel through Expedia, but I found booking the hotel through the hotel website to be the best deal. There are a number of booking options to save you money, so check them out. We went with the deal where you can book three nights and get the third night for free. I found that the rates fluctuate quite a bit depending on the weekday and season, but I think this is normal. The front desk staff was friendly and helpful at check- in explaining all of the various features of the hotel, and providing us with a complementary room upgrade. Our room was on the second floor facing the pool and close to the water wall. The sound of the water wall close to the room was very relaxing and I would recommend it as it creates some white noise to block out other sounds. I was never disturbed by any noise except a door slamming in the hallway very early one morning. The room was a good size with a king size bed. The bed was extremely comfortable. The only other hotel that I have stayed at with a bed comparable to this one is the Marriott in Calgary, Alberta. The sheets, duvet and pillows are very high quality. I loved how the bedding was all white so you could see the exact cleanliness of it. There was a gray Vellux blanket at the end of the bed also. The wine fridge, Keurig coffee maker, and complimentary water in the room were great! It would be really helpful if the room would add a small microwave. As there is no room service at the hotel, it would be nice to have a microwave to warm up any supper leftovers etc.. I really loved the unlimited late night snacks and drinks. The staff were always so accommodating with us. I was pleased with the Aveeno and Philosophy toiletries in the bathroom. The bathroom was clean; however, it smelled of cigarette smoke. The smell of the smoke seemed to really linger in the shower curtain, but I realize this is difficult to get rid of and it could have been some time since it happened. The signs for your room door just say \u201cdo not disturb\u201d on both sides. I was hoping one side would say something along the lines of \u201cplease make up room later.\u201d There were two out of nine days that our room was not made up because we slept in and used this sign. This was not a huge deal as we usually keep the room fairly neat, so I never mentioned it to the staff. I think a room sign update would be a great change. There was always plenty of parking at the hotel and many of the stalls have sun shades (not that we really needed them), but in hotter weather they would be a big plus. There were also some stalls to charge electric cars. I thought that this was very forward thinking, so I was a little surprised that there were no recycling bins or bags in the room. I also thought it might be a good idea for the hotel to have a sign in the washroom suggesting that guests place the towels that they want washed in the tub and the towels that they will use again on the rack. The pool was very nice and heated! It provides for a hip atmosphere with all of the coloured tile and fountains... The hot tub was even better. It is HUGE! I think fifty people could fit into it. My husband was able to enjoy this a bit more than me as I am expecting and decided to be safe and just put my legs in. There were plenty of loungers, beds and chairs around the pool. The music around the pool was a nice touch. The best features are the water wall, and the coloured lights in the pool and hot tub at night. We made it up to the roof top a couple of times to check out the views. It was beautiful up there. I think the renos are fantastic from the previous pictures that I looked at online. If I was able to drink, I likely would have tucked a bottle of wine away for a sunset up there. The hotel was very close to the galleries and museums that we wanted to check out. This was so convenient as we could actually walk to them, or you could use the light rail transit which is only a couple of blocks away. We took several walks around the surrounding neighbourhood and really enjoyed ourselves doing so. Gallo Blanco was an amazing restaurant. I think we ate there five times. I tried the fish tacos and they were delicious. The guacamole and tortilla chips are also very yummy. I was very surprised to see that the guacamole included oranges. I never would have thought to add them in, but it was a good addition. I love their iced tea (hibiscus), and the staff was gracious enough to make me one for the road. How sweet! We caught a glimpse of the Flamenco dancers on Wednesday night, but missed the show. If we get back to the Clarendon, I think it would be a very worthwhile evening.

If you are looking for something unique- boutique and FUN...this is your place. I love coming to Phoenix- Scottsdale in particular but this time our trip was for business- not pleasure. Location and price were the main considerations so I had to squash my desperate urge to stay at one of my fave places ever- The Phoenician- and pick a different venue. A timely Expedia email came with great deals for Phoenix, so we booked The Clarendon based on the reviews and great photos and took a chance. For what we got- the price was GREAT. Let me tell you the best things about this hotel first. It has a very cool vibe and the moment you check in, you feel very at ease. The front desk staff is friendly, easy going and helpful. We took an early flight in and I needed to check in 3 hours early- they were willing to do it for a $25 fee....I was tired and anxious to unpack and relax so I paid it and I appreciated the fact that I was given the choice and a room was available. This hotel is a mid-century building brought to life by colorful, retro decor and fun art everywhere. Our room was a 1 bedroom suite on the 2nd floor, overlooking the pool area. The bed was really comfortable and the furniture, art and retro style of the room was really cool. Our suite also came with a 50\" LG flat screen. Another touch I loved was that they are not stingy with the amenities....unlimited free water bottles and a big bag of ice were a truly nice surprise for someone like me, that drinks water ALL day. Extra towels, cups and even snacks from the \"mini-bar\" are all available at any time-you need only ask at the front desk. The pool is an event in itself and it's a cool scene with piped-in music, a glass wall of cascading water that lights up at night and a massive jacuzzi. If you want to chill poolside in a fun atmosphere- you will love it. There is a good restaurant on the property as well- Gallo Blanco. I ate there several times during our stay and I highly recommend the 1/2 Chicken \"Pollo Asado\"- so delish. We also went up to the rooftop area and although it seems to be undergoing some construction, the view and atmosphere up there was so gorgeous and romantic on a hot desert night. I'm sure when they are done working it will be incredible! Here are some things to consider: This is an old, mid-century building that has been updated. No central air...our room had 2 air conditioners and they made noise all night. The bathrooms are microscopic with a sink just outside of the toilet/shower. The scene at the hotel is happening and it's loud at night- if you want peace and quiet so you can drift gently off to sleep early...this is not your kinda place. Although these could be considered \"cons\", just realize that if you are looking for a resort with a luxury feel and those kinds of amenities- stick with the Phoenician or one like it.

The downtown chains were charging a fortune, so I took a risk on The Clarendon and was very pleasantly surprised. It's a \"funky\" place with a kind of urban \"distressed chic\" that LA, SF and NYC hotels try hard to achieve and charge a lot of money for. The Clarendon is relatively inexpensive and is the real thing: somewhat \"tatty\" as my British friends like to say, but with cool and trendy appointments that make it well worth staying a night or two. The staff were absolutely fabulous - friendly, helpful, thorough in explaining the property's amenities and totally down to earth (shout out to David at the front desk!!!). My Jr. Suite had a Samsung flat screen TV, a Keurig single cup coffee maker and a Sharper Image clock radio with a built in MP3 cord and soothing sounds. There were Egyptian cotton robes in the closet and a massage head in the shower. I also noticed some holes, chips and cracking in the plaster around the shower enclosure, but otherwise everything was clean and in fairly decent condition, a little used, that's all. Loved the fluffy towels. The rooms and corridors are painted in bright colors (my bathroom was azure blue) and decorated with old western movie photos blown up and turned into pop-art. It was hotter than blazes when I arrived and it took some time for the AC unit to cool the room down and I didn't dare venture outside to the pool or take in the view from the famous roof-top deck. One downside, the AC unit blows right at the bed and because I had to keep it on all night, the breeze kept waking me up. I did use one of the hotel's meeting rooms; filled with wall to ceiling mirrors and a giant marble boardroom table. Different. What makes this boutique hotel even more unique is its history as the site of the assassination in 1976 of investigative reporter Don Bolles whose car - with him inside - was blown up in the hotel parking lot. You would think a hotel would try to keep this kind of violent history under wraps. Nope - not the Clarendon, they put it front and center! They have a bronze bust of Bolles with an accompanying biography next to the front desk. And the hallway to the meeting rooms features huge blowup black and white police photographs of Bolles' Datsun, blown to smithereens - cool. The restaurant and bars in the main lobby are fun, relaxing and hip - the food (primarily Mexican) terrific and inexpensive. Parking is plentiful and free.

Physically, the property is a remodel of a much less reputable hotel, and the Clarendon is a big step up in style and substance from its predecessor. However, the legacy of the old hotel shows up in the awkward layout of rooms and the overall maintenance and condition of the property. There are a lot of things to like about the Clarendon. The staff are friendly and helpful. The service fee charged per room pays off late at night, when the front desk will cheerfully give you snacks (pepsi, cheetos, etc) after the restaurant closes. The bartenders make good drinks, and the bar and lounge areas, while modern and minimal in style, are welcoming and relaxing rather than pretentious or achingly hip. The best thing about the Clarendon, by far, is the rooftop lounge area. The Clarendon's location offers a great view in every direction, so you can sip your drink, hang out under the umbrellas, and chill out under the desert sky. After a hot day, few things are better than grabbing a cocktail from the bar downstairs and relaxing on the Clarendon rooftop with friends. But what could be one of the best things about the Clarendon is actually the best illustration of why Clarendon is, at best, a flawed but oddly charming property. The Clarendon would like you to think that it is built around a pool scene, and indeed you can see a pool or two there in the courtyard, with colorful umbrellas and a reasonable attempt to look like a boutique hotel in Palm Springs. But the wide variety of clientele results in a confusing pool scene mixing kids, older parents, vacationers, would-be hipsters, local partiers, and alcoholics, none of whom is quite sure that the others are really supposed to be there. Time of day doesn't seem to matter, either, and this strange pool scene bleeds into the rooftop scene the longer the night goes on. It's not unusual to hear kids stomping up the stairs to the rooftop, then see them running around shouting and punching each other while their drunk parents grope and fumble through a slow dance while barely avoiding the cactus. Ah, romance. The least attractive feature of the Clarendon is the relentless noise. Part of this is due to the general condition of the hotel. In our suite, for instance, the windows rattled incessantly, prompting a quick fix of wedging paper into the window frame just so we could hear each other talk. Likewise, as a legacy of its earlier incarnation as a much cheaper sort of hotel, the walls are very thin, both between rooms and between the rooms and common areas. But part of the noise is also due to the wide range of noise-making clientele. All of the noise from kids screaming and stomping, pool music blaring, drunk people shout-talking, and outside traffic zooming and honking, is transmitted directly into your ears with minimal interference. Even having a suite, with a (mostly pointless) sitting room situated between the front door and the sleeping area, didn't make much of a difference. The key to boutique hotels is having a unique vision and identity that carries through the entire property. While the Clarendon has obviously done a lot of work to upgrade the appearance of the property, much less thought has gone into what kind of hotel it is really supposed to be. The result is more like a budget motel with nice decor and attached bar/restaurant than it is a boutique hotel. I can't recommend it for long stays. But if you're in town for a night, you might check it out, if only to sip your cocktail on the rooftop and enjoy the desert breeze.", "Date": "August 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oxnard, CA", "Title": "\u201cBest Eclectic Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Michellee67", "ReviewID": "UR116876121", "Content": "The waterfall by the pool, the decor of the rooms and the rooftop view out out of this world!", "Date": "August 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "laveen", "Title": "\u201cUnique and different!\u201d", "Author": "dbandfamily", "ReviewID": "UR116760102", "Content": "As others have said, if you are looking for a chain feel, this is not the place.

There where a lot of folks in the pool on a Friday evening, from 3-5, maybe a large group? So the noise was up around the pool area during that time. But after that cleared out, there was room. This is not a diving pool, but a nice area to cool off and relax. There is only one pool area. We did not hear a lot of noise from our room, as the wall are concrete. We loved lounging in the Rooftop Deck area at night, so relaxing. The staff was friendly and attentive. Gavin was greeting people and helping them with their bags, opening doors and just generally welcoming. Towels where available at the front desk, just a few feet from the pool area, so no big deal for us. Perhaps keeping track of how many are given to guests in specific rooms would a way of keeping control. This was done at some of the other hotels we have stayed at. They ask you how many you need, and track it, and at the end of your stay, that is what is expected to be returned. I would have loved some umbrella's or shade structures in the pool area as the sun can be excruciatingly hot, they have these set up in the rooftop patio area. It seem they have more and new exciting renovations happening, so I think it will only improve.

I had visited the property once before, a few years back when the restaurant on the premises was under different management; I was left with the impression that the hotel looked really cool and fun and I made a mental note to check it out sometime. With the special deal I found, I decided now was the time. I booked a Jr. Suite for both nights, and my first stay was last night. I checked in early before my boyfriend arrived. Rachel helped me check in and was really friendly and helpful. I took in all the details as I walked to the elevator and then to my room. Really fun, local tilt-shift photography was hung on the walls leading to my room (#221). I wish I had snapped a few photos of my room, because it was really fun - a great king-size bed with a funky, upholstered headboard, dark-wood heavy furniture, a plush occasional chair by a lamp, a long desk/dresser, a 42\" (if not bigger) TV anchored to the wall, and awesome blue walls made up the room. Unfortunately, I noticed the room hadn't been cleaned properly. By the Keurig coffee maker, I found a mess of opened sugar packets, creamer, and used swizzle sticks, and no cups or coffee. I called down to the front desk and Rachel answered. I told her what I found, and she came up to check it out. She seemed sincerely disgusted at what she saw and she was very apologetic. She left the room and came back with some cups and went down once again and this time returned with coffee, tea, and a wet rag to wipe down the counter. She also brought a few bags of chips, some candy bars, and four bottles of chilled water. She asked me what else she could do to make up for the mess, but I told her she'd done enough - more than was her responsibility, actually. Later that evening, after a pretty dismal experience at the Gallo Blanco Cafe, in the hotel lobby, I stopped at the front desk to request some extra towels and some sugar for the coffee. Ben, the owner, happened to be at the desk at the time and told me he heard we'd had a bad experience at the restaurant and asked how our stay had been otherwise. I told him about what happened before in the room and complimented him on having Rachel on his staff. Like Rachel, he was very apologetic and asked what he could do to make up for it. He also told me it had been Rachel's first day, and I couldn't have been more surprised - what an asset to his team! Before we went back upstairs, Ben gave me his card and asked me to let him know when we'd be staying over again so he could upgrade us to a full suite. He then came by the room with a huge stack of freshly laundered towels (they were still warm!) and apologized again and thanked us for our patience. Talk about customer service! When we checked out, Rachel was back at the front and asked about how our night went. I recapped for her the rest of the events and she again thanked me for our patience and good nature. This is why I support local businesses, especially when they hire amazing people who know how to treat their patrons and guests. For the wonderful customer service we were given, I'm rating this hotel five stars. Ben and Rachel, THANK YOU for being great. I look forward to our next stay, though I wish I didn't have to wait until November! P.S. - The amazing AC in the room?

Off Clarendon and Central-ish, it's near the light rail and the best of the Valley's local restaurants, museums. But it's also far enough off of Central that you know when you pull up that you can expect to actually get some sleep at night. The hotel is done in a retro, 60s-ish mod theme, with bright colors and clearly defined shapes in every room you look -- but it's done authentically and doesn't feel ostentatious (which is saying something, since the lobby has mirrored, flocked wallpaper). Obviously, the standouts at this hotel are the pool, the rooftop deck and Gallo Blanco, the onsite Mexican restaurant. The pool is gorgeous and worth the stay all by itself. Astroturf spots throughout the pool deck area are an awesome touch (no burned tootsies!) and the spa is seriously the largest I've ever seen, and according to their Web site, it seats 50 people. Reportedly, the pool has underwater speakers & light-up stars at night, but neither of these were working when I stayed here. We had a junior suite, which was ridiculously huge. It had two desks, a giant tv, a fridge and a king bed but enough space for 10+ to just stand around. Pretty sure it's the size of my living room. The bed is heavenly! Also, the whole hotel is older (60s-era Phoenix) so it's all concrete block construction. The benefit is that the room stays cool even without the A/C on... the downside is that the internet reception is spotty. At night, go down to the front desk and get FREE munchies -- full size candy bars, soda, otter pops & mini bags of chips. Before 10p they're $1, but still.

Of course you're not supposed to have glass in the pool area, but there's not enough staff out there to monitor that. The rooftop lounge is also overrated. Basically blue carpet, lawn furniture, and big umbrellas. Also run down. If you do decide to support independently owned businesses and stay there, be sure to bring your own towels. Towels were at a premium when we stayed. The front desk was always running short on either pool towels or bath towels. We ended up hoarding every towel we could get our hands on. Oh, we were on the 4th floor and the elevator was busted for at least a day. Luckily it wasn't a day we were bringing luggage up to or down from our room. The superior service everyone refers to in their reviews was a big attraction for us. We found it just average. The bright spot of this place is the restaurant in the hotel.

We've stayed in a lot of Boutique hotels and have to admit that the consistency can vary on things like cleanliness, etc. What I was most dissapointed about was how incomplete the renovation of this building is. The bathrooms in the rooms have not even been professionally painted and the tub and toilet were at least 20 years old. This building appears to be an apartment complex from the 60's that someone had a limited budget to turn into a hotel. Not great. I can only assume from the awards that this hotel has received that there isn't much competition as far as boutique hotels go in Phoenix. The carpet in the rooms is dark and it is easy to tell how unclean it is. The rooftop patio is a joke. The colorful tiles in the pool area are dirty. Bottom line is that there just doesn't seem to be a lot of pride of ownership here. This hotel will be a wreck in another 5 years. Too bad because there was a good idea here at some point, but it lacked the budget to complete it properly and the know how to keep it that way.", "Date": "May 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brooklyn, New York", "Title": "\u201cGreat boutique hotel for a surprisingly low price\u201d", "Author": "littletree", "ReviewID": "UR107589578", "Content": "I stayed at the Clarendon for two nights and I have nothing but positive things to report: The entire place is really well designed, if aesthetics are important to you -- the rooms, the lobby, the little cafe, and even the artwork on the walls all feel modern and slightly playful.

I called the reception desk to report this loud noise and smoke, she said she thought she smelled something too and would investigate...nothing was done.

Said she was told by the guy that by city ordinance that he could start work at 6:00am. I showed her the smoke in the room and she said she would see what could be done...I told her we were leaving.

Forgot suntan lotion, no problem, you can borrow some of theirs. We had booked a Jr. Suite, but upon checking in were upgraded to a 1 bedroom suite. We headed up to room 308, which was on the end, so it was a good location. The room was spacious and decorated with a modern trendy type flair. The bed was extremely comfortable. The air conditioning units...the one in the bedroom was fine. The one in the living room made an annoying noise every now and again. Unfortunately if we shut it off the bedroom just got too hot, so we lived with the noise. It wasn't constant so it wasn't so bad. The rooms contain bottles of water, that you don't have to pay for as well as a mini refrigerator. Big pluses in my book. The bathroom is a little small and could use a bit of an update but it was fine. The only issue we had was that our room wasn't cleaned 1 day. After being out all morning we returned about 3pm to find our room had not been touched. We asked the front desk and were told they were still cleaning, so we headed for the pool for a couple of hours only to return again with the room not being cleaned. The next morning our room was cleaned while we were at breakfast. Not sure what happened, but it wasn't anything to get real upset about. You pay an additional $15/night for use of pool and wifi, etc. The pool is great as is the large whirlpool. Gallo Blanco located in the lobby is delicious as I mentioned my review for that. The rooftop was a nice place to sit an watch the sunset or enjoy a drink at night. Pay attention to their recommended restaurants in the area and trust them.

The room was just fine, a top floor junior suite that was clean and well appointed. It had two new beds, a very nice, large flat screen TV, and hip furniture. The radio was set to some sort of in-house sound system that put out very cool music that was perfect for chilling in the room. I slept very well in the bed and didn't want to get out in the morning.

They bill themselves as a 'boutique' and in many ways this former small hotel (105 rooms) is, with truly wonderful staff, quirky bold colors in rooms, high quality bedding, Heurig coffee maker, fridge, safe, flat screen TV and other nice touches. The virtually unlimited free \"munchies\" after 10 PM (candy bars, chips, sodas, candles) are cool, the courtyard large pool and huge hot tub are gorgeous with a massive water wall, and the restaurant is truly popular, and it's truly dog friendly. What's not to love? Well, the day without water due to a leak, the frozen elevator, the burned out light, a defective clock alram that lacked instructions, and the constantly dropping WiFi, along with missing Kimono Robes, led to a day's credit (granted without too much grumbling). The machine-gunned oil drum sculpture outside the statue of a journalist killed here 40 years ago is a bit out-of-place even in a culture that allows guns to be carried by everyone (particularly at this point in time) including a few mentally ill types. The room we had - 320 - has only a small unopenable window, so it felt a bit like a jail cell despite the attractive wall art. The $15 \"resort fee\" (access to the pool, the munchies, and a few other things) was also a surprise, and it is stupid, since it's mandatory, and distorts the price by making it appear $15 cheaper than it is, which is, frankly, insulting to customers' intelligence. Overall, it's a nice place, but they might want to think about why Holiday Inn used to be so attractive: Despite being bland, the slogan was \"No surprises.\" There were too many surprises here, many unpleasant, but if The Clarendon makes some changes, they'll be both gently quirky AND enjoyable.", "Date": "February 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Phoenix", "Title": "\u201cUnique hotel... very loud party going on.\u201d", "Author": "travelbrain3343", "ReviewID": "UR95973144", "Content": "I will start with the good part. This is my second time staying at this hotel and I love that they have remodeled this building into an extremely unique hotel. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful when I had a question (I will come back to this later). The room was spacious, comfortable and fairly clean. The restaurant is great and has a menu that you will not find in any \"run of the mill\" Mexican restaurant. In order to fairly give you the not so great portion of my review, I will give you the reason why I was is Phoenix and why I decide to stay at the Clarendon. I drove to Phoenix (5 hours) to visit my grandmother who was in the nearby hospital recovering from major brain surgery. I had my mind set on staying at this hotel because of my experience in the past and it was close to the hospital where my Grammy was. When I arrived, tired from my travels, I noticed a lot of activity in the lobby of the hotel. I did not ask why there was so much activity because I was anxious to drop off my belongings and get over to Good Samaratan hospital to visit Grammy. I ask for directions to the hospital which were given to me by a very nice front desk employee and departed for the hospital. When I returned to the hotel at 8 pm there was a rather large party going on in the pool area with many people and a DJ. This was a Saturday night and this seems to be a hotspot for nightlife. When I returned to the room my door was not shut and after further investigation the latch seemed to be faulty. I would not have been to worried about this until I realized the amount of par tiers so near to my door, I also had a laptop and iPad sitting on the desk that could have easily been lifted. I really don't mind that they were having a party since this seems to be the way this hotel makes money on occasion, but, it would have been nice if the front desk employees let me know that this was going on, especially since I told them why I was in town. The party didn't go on all night and I was able to fall asleep before it had end (I am not woken up easily). In closing, I would say that this is a great place to stay if you are traveling with friends or a loved one that is interested in a little excitement. I would not recommend the Clarendon if you are visiting and ailing family member.

Staff was ok, not very friendly, more concerned with gossiping between themselves about weather someone working with them was gay or not. I don't care, but don't talk about it so everyone has to hear the conversation. Loved the bed!! It was so very comfortable and I was surprised when I woke up that it was after 7am. I never sleep so long. Thank you for that. Great tv for unwinding with wonderful channel line-up. Was disappointed with the Wi-FI. It kept disconnecting trying to switch to different wi-fi networks all evening and the following morning. Was very frustrated with this as I was hoping to get some work done in the evening and then the following morning. Wished the room had a clock in the room, I hate waking up and not knowing what time it is. The room was also missing the hairdryer and I had to wait at least 30 minutes before one got to me.

It was obvious she had not vacuumed. I picked up four different pieces of garbage from the desk, coffee table and floor. Amazingly, the maid came back twice between mid-afternoon and bedtime to remake the bed! Why I have no idea. I'd rather she had vacuumed! lol The carpets in the foyer and elsewhere show signs of wear (a lot of staining) and sections of the exterior have paint peeling off the surfaces. The roof deck needs a barrier to block the view of the mechanicals that cover the non-decked area. (The Saturday morning yoga class on the roof did not happen.)

We were promised a prompt reply to our email. Now, more than a month later, we still have not heard anything. I normally do not write feedback on Tripadvisor. However, this will now go out to the tripadvisor community, so you can make up your own mind about this hotel. Here is our email to management: Hi, I usually do not leave feedback for hotels, but thought different in this instance due to the fact that you do seem to be an owner that do care about your business. I also travel to Phoenix fairly often for business, and may consider coming back if some of the issues mentioned below are changed. Overall, we were pleased with many things about your hotel. But there are things you have to address in order to continue being successful long term in my opinion. This time my business partner and I brought our girlfriends on the trip, and with this in mind, I will give you some feedback directly, as opposed to putting it up on tripadvisor. I think it's easy to bash businesses on tripadvisor. I would rather deal with this directly with you, so you do not receive a bad rating on this (which bottom line I believe our overall experience does warrant). Our reservation was for two nights. If I did not happen to look at my paperwork when checking in, we would have only had the room for one night, since this is what the clerk put us in for. She fixed this on the spot (blamed the computer system), but I believe this may have cost us down the road, since we had to move rooms so they could accommodate our two nights instead of one. We dropped off our luggage real quick in the room, and went to the roof top bar to catch the sunset. You have a great set up there. Friendly bartender from Denver too. We also dined in your restaurant that night. Top notch service, drinks, and food. Also had a few drinks in the bar after that, same experience. After that, went to bed, great beds by the way. Your carpet is stained though in room 308 though. Not sure what was in there, but it was not a good first impression for us when we first opened the door. Looks like you can fix this with the type of square carpets you have smartly put in. Got woken up at 5:15am in the morning by the ipod player in the room. Previous guest must have set this alarm. Had no idea how to turn it off, so unplugged it in the dark. But five minutes later it started again. So turned on the light, and figured out how to turn it off. By then it was hard to go back to sleep. Suggestion: Have your maid make sure ipod alarms are not on for future guests. Minor details, but I believe this should be standard in any maid education. We realized when we woke up that we did not have any robes, extra pillows, only two small towels and one big one, and no ironing board. Batteries in the remote control did not work either. One would imagine this is standard in all rooms (from what we could see through the windows in other rooms), so we went downstairs to get this fixed. No problem, friendly service, they would take care of it. However, eight hours later when we returned, we still did not have this taken care of. No idea what happened, must have fallen through the cracks. Not good for a hotel that does try to compete with other nicer hotels. In addition, when we got back to our room, we realized it had not been cleaned. We did have the \"do not disturb\" sign up while my girlfriend was taking a shower in the morning, but that was it. When I called down, I was told the cleaners \"finished early today, and are not here anymore\". Huh?? This is below par service for a two star hotel, let alone someone at your standard. The turn down service guy did give us extra towels and did take care of getting the ironing board and robes. Props to him for that. But still.....wow.....this needs to be fixed for other guests. There worst part was not even an option available. We were just going to \"have to deal with it\" kind of attitude with your front desk, who also put me on hold for five minutes before I just decided to call back. We spent some time in the hot tub in the early evening Saturday night. Nice work on this. Looks great. Also, nice pool party with DJ on Sunday. Really enjoyed this. Your pool side waitress gave us lemon juice though when we ordered a margarita at one point. When we asked the inside bartender about this, she quickly fixed this and mixed us a real margarita. No idea what happened here. But happy to report this got fixed. When checking out I told the front desk person I was not going to pay for the extra service charges. Told her I was not comfortable with this, considering we did not in any way receive resort level service this weekend. She did not like this, but finally agreed to take these charges off. In my opinion, this should have been taken off, no questions asked. I could probably have gotten a full refund for all charges, including the room, at places like the Hampton Inn or Hilton down the street. So, there you have it. I would never leave a message like this with a chain hotel. I would just not come back if I was not happy. Being an entrepreneur myself, I see the value that you bring to the table, and want to give you some constructive feedback to help your business. As I said, we fly into Phoenix pretty often.

Some of the most delicious Mexican food ever, served up by a courteous, friendly, and good-looking staff. Reasonably priced as well. But here's the real reason I'm writing this review: It's a Saturday afternoon, and I'm chilling in the lobby with some friends. A few hours later, I notice that my expensive sunglasses are missing. Last place I remember having them? The lobby. I stupidly left them sitting on the big coffee table. I ask a woman at the front desk if there's a lost and found; she checks it, and there's no sunglasses there. I search all my bags; no sunglasses. I go back to the front desk, where I meet Ben, the manager. I desperately ask if there's \"another lost and found\" in the hotel. He quickly offers to review the lobby security camera tape from the time I was there, to see if anyone recovered them Then he gives me his card, and says to email him if I need anything else. I go upstairs and turn my room upside down; no sunglasses. Back downstairs I mention this to Ben; he says \"Hmmm...wait here a minute,\" and goes into the office. Comes back a minute later, asks me to describe the sunglasses, which I do. That's when he hands them over, saying that they were somewhere else in the office and not in the lost and found. A hotel manager willing to review a security camera tape to help recover a pair of lost sunglasses? Never heard of a big chain doing that! For the most part, The Clarendon is definitely a place for dazzling urbanites and hipsters to hook up: very trendy-looking, slightly funky (rooms could be a little cleaner and better maintained), but the staff will go the extra mile for you when asked.

There is a very nice pool area. The jacuzzi is one of the largest I have ever seen. A very nice thing about it is that it's in a central courtyard and protected from the weather and the sun. I guess you could call the decor \"retro 60's.\" Attractive and stark in a good way. My room was very spacious and well furnished. The bed was very comfortable. The furniture was well-placed and useful. Good toiletries in the bath. Good lighting. Great TV. Everything was very clean and well-maintained. For most of us the primary reason for staying in a hotel is to have a comfortable sleep. I have 3 basic requirements for that: comfortable bed, quiet and dark. The bed was very comfortable. Unfortunately you can hear people in the hall quite well and room doors opening and closing, until very late. And the room was far from dark for sleeping. The window had two shades .... one for filtering light and one for \"blackout.\" However the blackout shade did not block light from outside. The door to the room lacked weather-stripping to block light as well as cushion the closing to prevent noise. It would be accurate to say that the room doors \"slammed\" when they closed. And a lot of light came into the room around the edges of the door. I think people who design hotel rooms should have to sleep in them .... particularly at night. And they need to be frequent travelers to understand travelers' needs. The hotel has some rough edges. A glass-sided elevator which gives a view only of concrete blocks and wiring. The elevator's call buttons don't always work and require several tries. An area between the front desk and the bar/restaurant where the block walls are rough and unfinished. Pipes sticking out of the wall in the room where there used to be kitchenettes.

The Clarendon probably isn't for everyone (e.g., perhaps, the older set), but we enjoyed the fruits of some very creative and talented decorating/designing minds. The first impression, from the exterior, is of an old 70s apartment building with a colorful paint job, but stepping inside, our eyes got a little big and we felt like we'd landed in a cool corner of Hollywood. None of this, frankly, is a real priority to us (traveling with a toddler), but nonetheless, the real art on the walls (most of which appeared to be for sale), the funky wallpaper, creative light fixtures, & other unique design touches, the awesome rooftop bar, and the extremely friendly staff all made for a truly pleasureable stay. The pool area is surely the centerpiece of the hotel, with a gorgeously & colorfully tiled walkable divider between the 'cool pool' and the very spacious 'hot pool'. The backdrop to all this was some very modern and diverse pool furniture, and a stunning 'wall of water', fronted by cacti. The night we were there, there was also flamenco on the rooftop (only until 9pm, which suited us fine). Our room was the 2-room suite, ground level, poolside, and we had no noise concerns, but perhaps that was partly a function of our midweek stay, as I could see the pool being a real hotspot on the weekends. Our unit was spacious, the bed comfortable, and the interior decor made the best that can be done with an older building, adding character and a feeling that a real person, a real COOL person, designed the room and decor.

Only one robe for 2 people, 2 bath towels (thick as they were), and only 3 pillows. Yes, I can call down for more -- but, really? I expect to have enough in my room. Asked for an extra pillow the next morning, and had to ask again that evening because we didn't get it. Room was cold the first night; the AC unit blows a draft on the bed. It has complicated controls we couldn't figure out (the front desk explained it the next morning, but something actually in the room would have helped a lot, especially since the stop button didn't do anything) and no extra blankets, so we were cold the first night. Lovely sheets on the bed. Light switch by the door turned on the light next to the bed, so when you turn it off at night next to you, the switch doesn't turn anything on the next time you enter the room. Switches were on the cords of the lamps, which were tucked behind the furniture, so you have to pull up the cord each time to turn them on or off, which was irritating. The elevator was broken at least twice -- we gave up and just walked up the stairs each time which was okay except when I was really tired and it was still broken. Walked our luggage down the stairs at the end of our stay. Didn't go to the roof deck, not in the mood to walk two more flights to see it. The extra $10 fee is ridiculous; they should just add it onto the room rate since it's not optional. Ate in the restaurant and it was great; recommended twice by people not affiliated with the hotel. The thing that was the last straw for me was that our room was not cleaned one day. Come on, that's a basic! I was furious. We came back late and I called down. The front desk said, \"Oh, sorry. Um, housekeeping is gone for the day, but I can bring up some clean towels if you like.\" Yes. No further apologies. When he brought them up, he offered to take the other towels away, but the bathroom was occupied, so he said I could leave them in the hall. I did, assuming they'd be taken away, but they were still there, in the hallway, the next morning. I would have kept them in my room if I'd realized they'd just be there all night, gross. Told the front desk the next morning that our room hadn't been cleaned and to make sure it was -- no apology at all, he just nodded and made a note in the computer. When I left, I commented on this on the envelope where they want you to leave the tip, which has place for comments, and no one has gotten back to me still. I would not stay here again.

Reviewing there website the $10 charge is listed in tiny print within a very wordy paragraph.

I assume that others have been surprised by the fee because there are signs posted in the elevator explaining how they charge you an extra $10 a night.

'samples' in place of bar soap, i.e. 'body wash' and the like. Okay, there was a small sample of MEN'S body wash, infused with those pore-scrubbing bits of crystal sand or whatnot, and that was IT. All the other samples were either facial moisturizer, hand lotion, disposable razors, shampoo/conditioner. NO HAND SOAP. And there was only ONE bath towel, for a room reserved for TWO people; had to go get one downstairs . .. and another thing: I had requested NO DOWN OR FEATHER BEDDING as I am allergic, and there were feather pillows in the room when we arrived: the same desk clerk brought up replacements after notifying him of the mistake, and was going to just leave the original pillows in the room on the only chair (as there was no other place to store them), so I asked him to please just take them out of the room, and though he gave me a funny look he did take them. . . but later that afternoon, after returning from a brief outing, we found those feather pillows BACK in the room, on the only chair!!! Okay, enuf about the pillows . . . this room was NOT economy-priced, either, at $179 for a Tuesday night, with no 'extras' like breakfast . . . and NO BAR SOAP. Also, the window shades did not work, and so were forever open so one had to find a dark corner to disrobe in. Lighting was strange and ineffective, as well as puzzling to figure how and where to turn it on. Each lamp/fixture had it's own bizarre personality, as well. All in all, it's just a creepy place, with that added roadside attraction of being where that news reporter was murdered back in the 80s or something. It has a 60's motel-attempt-to-morph-into-upscale-boho-inn feel about it . . .

I was impressed after not only reading the positive reviews on Tripadvior, but the fact that the hotel manager individually responded to most comments and complains. Everyone I spoke with at the front desk was very friendly and helpful throughout my stay. The hotel is located in the museum district of Phoenix. There is covered parking for a fee, but I was able to find parking on the street right outside the hotel each night which was free. The room I booked was a junior suite and it included a large HDTV and a small single seater couch. The bed and pillows were incredibly comfortable and were comparable to 5 star Hilton, Hyatt, and Marriots I've stayed at. The walls were painted blue, with a multicolored rug and artwork hung on the wall. There was a very modern Fujitsu air conditioning / heater unit that was controlled with a remote and did not restrict you from making the room as cold or hot as you pleased. The hotel featured a bar and Mexican restaurant in the lobby, which was pretty tasty but a little pricey, especially for cocktails. There is a rooftop bar, which was great for taking photos of the city. Also, there is a outdoor pool and hottub, which I did not get the chance to use. Unfortunately, the noise insulation between the rooms and the hallways is not very great, so I could hear conversations in the hallway and every time a door opened and closed it made a loud noise. I stayed on the 2nd floor and the first night (Saturday) was relatively quiet as the hotel was nearly empty but by the second night (Sunday) it had filled up and it was difficult to sleep with all of the noise in the hallway. I spoke to the front desk in the morning and they moved me to another room on the 3rd floor which had much less guests. However, this room had an older style window which did not provide noise insulation from the street so I could hear cars going by, and also there was a terrible draft. In addition, the bathtub looked like it was in the middle of being renovated and there was uneven coats of paint on the bottom. I spoke to the front desk and requested that I could check out early, and they were happy to accommodate me. Even though I prepaid the hotel through hotels.com, and the cancellation policy clearly stated I would not be eligible for a refund, they simply told me they would refund the money to hotels.com and I would just need to call them to get my refund. Sure enough, I made one phone call after returning home and had my refund for the nights I didn't stay on my credit card. Overall I feel this is a great value hotel that is trendy and has a unique feel to it. The staff did everything they could to make my stay more comfortable. However, if you are sensitive to noise, you should consider bringing earplugs as you will hear everything in the hallway. Also, be sure to ask for a room that is fully renovated, if you don't want to hear street noise and have a draft in the winter.", "Date": "January 18, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "MN", "Title": "\u201cShould be the number 1 rated hotel in Phoenix!\u201d", "Author": "ASBMinnesota", "ReviewID": "UR53213205", "Content": "Friendly staff, great food and bar area, excellent pool and even better hot tub.

And you had better like their music, because you're going to hear lots of it. The elevator that takes you to the death chamber at San Quentin is better than the elevator here. They should have cyanide capsules under glass that you can break and gulp down in the event you get stuck inside for longer than 60 seconds. The architecture is trailer-trash-meets-hip-wannabe.

The bar/restaurant downstairs was good, and poured a good margarita, but we never made it to the roof top. There is a bust and memorial to a reporter who was murdered out front of the hotel a couple of decades ago that was interesting. The hotel had to be something else in an earlier age, either an old Holiday Inn or maybe an office building. We were (gratefully) upgraded to what I would have expected to pay about $150 a nite for at a Hyatt or Marriott, but I paid almost twice that. I cringe when I think of what we would have been given for my original reservation. Our room was inside a building, but the doors of most rooms faced an outdoor hallway and the (very nice) pool area. The hallway was musty smelling. The room was large and decorated in a pop western film motif. Those are the nice things I can say about the room. The air barely worked and was so hot and musty smelling that my wife and I could barely sleep. The window shades did not open, the desk chair was ready to fall apart and bathroom needs a refurbish. The linens were very nice, but the $5 water in the room was a little steep. When we travel on pleasure my wife and I normally like to stay in the room until late checkout and leisurely make our way back to the airport. At the Clarendon we couldn't wait to leave.

As soon as we walked in, we were so happy we had moved! This hotel just oozes urban chic, from the snazzy pool area with a \"wall of water\" and humungous hot tub, to the hopping bar, to the cool artwork throughout the hotel. The entire atmosphere was like a breath of fresh energy - especially as compared to the typical \"box\" hotels I stay in for business. While we've stayed in boutique hotels before, the experience hasn't always been good. Here, the service was spectacular from the moment we walked in until the moment we left. People there seem to genuinely like their jobs. The room itself continued the trendy feel. I loved the painted window shade that glided over the window looking over the interior courtyard! I also loved the fact that we could open our exterior window to get fresh air. (This is usually a pet peeve of mine with newer hotels - that you can't open the windows.) The true test was the bed. I can't remember when I've slept that well in a hotel. The bed was extremely comfortable. Now I understand why they make a big deal about the bedding on the website. It was the first time in a while that I've been away from home and not longed for my own bed. The rooftop deck was cool, both literally and figuratively. We went up to see the sunset the first night we were there. The view was gorgeous (I posted pics), but it was cool and windy (hazard of the time of year). The staff valiantly lit portable heaters and placed fleece blankets about on the sofas. We bundled under them, thankful that we could stay up there until the sun was gone. Minor issues: free wireless signal was weak from our room, but we could access it from the lobby. Saturday night private party in the pool area looked/sounded really cool, but the music could be heard in our room. Thankfully, it ended by 11pm, which is a reasonable weekend hour, I think. Nice touches: free phone calls, room fridge where we kept our leftovers from dinner and some waters, pretty complete gym (and my husband's very particular), free sunscreened lot parking, gorgeous flatscreen TV, in-room coffee service. On the whole, we were extremely happy with the experience and would definitely recommend it to friends who want something different than the every day boring hotel.

I found security to be a little scary, as a side door was continually propped open allowing anyone to access the guestroom floors without walking by the front desk or key access.

The toilet basin was not properly attached, and slammed into the wall every time you flushed. The air conditioning didn\u2019t work very well at all (kept our room at about 80 degrees when on High), and blew hot air directly at the head of the bed. Additionally, the AC controls were on the ceiling, so you had to pull up a chair to adjust them (not that it did you any good). The bed linens were nice, and the mattress was fairly comfortable. BUT, rather than paying for a duvet cover for the comforter, they simply wrapped it up in two sheets. The sheets, of course, didn\u2019t stay on the comforter well at all during the night. The end result was that you were sleeping with 3 bunched sheets and one dirty comforter \u2013 not at all pleasant. The Clarendon Hotel is, quite obviously, a gay hotel.

It didn't help that I am 5 months pregnant, and had to endure \"God, I HATE breeders!\" and like comments in the elevator and lobby. The clientele was obviously on the prowl for a one-night stand. The neighborhood is sketchy. There are two doors from the parking area that ought to be locked at all times, but were always open and unlocked during our 5 day stay here, leaving the hotel totally unsecure.

Lots of funky furniture, a well stocked minibar, and crazy window coverings. The room itself was clean and the bathroom amenities nice. There are two robes hanging for use during your stay.

It was mid march and the weather was fantastic, around 75 degrees during the day and 57 at night. THE HOTEL: The hotel is 15 stories tall with a rooftop lounge that allows the occupant to watch the glow of the Arizona sunset. Two elevators carry passengers from the lobby to the top floor and back. The room was easy to find and access as ours was on the third floor room \u201c312\u201d. The elevators require a keycard for access to the rooms for personal security. OUR ROOM: This was the best part! The room included a huge California King sized bed, a 50 inch big screen HD television, along with a nice sized bathroom and Jacuzzi/bathtub. Also included was a complimentary refrigerator and a mini bar. LOCATION: The only thing that put a ding in this hotels services is its location. The closest restaurant is nearly 4 miles away.

The overall quality was good, and the free continental breakfasts weren\u2019t too bad either. Overall the stay was highly enjoyable, and the cost for what the rooms provided was a nice change.

If you want to know in advance what to expect, go for Hyatt, Hilton, etc. If you want to foster local American economy and help a guy who started from scratch - Go Clarendon! This is not 4 star standard I must (unfortunately) agree. But if you are not ready to hop in your grave yet (i.e. you don't feel old), can dig a certain level of noise from the aircon and c) dig that sometimes things break (like the elevator and the On Demand Movies when I was there) this is a cool place to stay.

What disturbed me a bit at first was that the Wi-Fi didn't work in my room - or was it my laptop? Well, it worked with my laptop in the bar and outside and I really enjoyed sitting there typing mails and sipping on a beer or a cocktail (both were excellent). What really distinguishes the Clarendon is its staff. That's if you like cool people and don't expect stiffness and butler like behavior. Stacy, who took care of my breakfast, is a class of her own. Her life loving attidude makes it easy to start your day. On three evenings I enjoyed their South-Western kitchen (no it is not Japanese anymore, but the cook can probably do anything for you). I liked the food, and I'm from Europe,i.e. I don't eat fat stuff like burgers. I also liked the comfortable bed and the cleanliness of my room.

During my trip this February in part for work but also for fun, I had an opportunity to stay at the Clarendon again. I don't know how they do it but they have certainly improved on their already spectacular service and ammenities. Two of the \"Must Do's\" during your stay at the Clarendon. The awesome roof top sunset exeperience is one. I got a chance to enjoy a beer while watching the sun set from this amazing roof top vantage point. The roof has been recently remodled to give the guest a incredible panoramic view of uptown and downtown Phoenix not to mention the incredible South, Estrella and White Tank Mountains. The roof top seating provided for guests and vistors of the Clarendon certainly hold true the Hotel's creative and unique high end decore. The second must do while at the Clarendon, have a meal at their new restuarant, C4. This restuarant has certianly molded in to the hot spot for the hotel guests and locals. C4 is working with their local vendors and focusing on gearing their menu to reflect the produce and animals raised in the Phoenix Metro and surrounding areas. What again ties all of this together is the attentive employees at the Clarendon. This group certainly knows how to make guests feel how much they value you; from the nice lady who cleans your room and says, \"Good Morning\", to the person who brings you room service in the evening.

The staff is young - but good, and the whole place has a fun attitude, from the background music to the Employee of the Month photo wall ( you have to see it). The pool area is great and the rooftop happy hour (with DJ) was a lot of fun (at this time of year, anyway). Rooms were large and the bed was very nice, & it had a sort of living room that made me think it would be a great place for a few people to get together and party. My only criticism is that for the price I paid ($219) I would expect a little more attention to detail in the remodeling than they did. You can tell its an older place that's been restyled, but they didn't 100% hit the mark with the quality of certain small things.

Restaurant closed. Painting didn\u2019t cover the window space and as first floor we had to improvise with hanger and long garment for privacy from car park outside. Sink didn\u2019t hold water and toiletries from previous guests were down the back as there is a gap. Toilet not fixed to the floor and cistern barely fixed to the wc and seat loose. Toilet paper holder also loose and roll kept sliding off onto the floor. Main door to suite had no door stop and hole in wall from impact. No plastic or glass drinking glasses just \u2018perfect touch\u2019 coffee ones. Plastic glass brought with us for husband to take medication was thrown out by the housekeeper. Coffee, shampoo and tissues not replenished second day ($2 left for housekeeper). I had to ask at reception whether the items left in the fridge/room were complimentary as no list of charges left in the room. When we pointed out our concerns regarding the room to the girl on duty she was surprised to see the room as she hadn't realised there were still rooms being used which hadn't been upgraded i.e. granite tops to avoid water damage from ice bucket condensation etc. She also stated that the room rates had been reduced since our direct booking with the hotel and this should have been spotted at the time of check-in. Our bill was reduced by 50% and we were assured that on our return for the night of the 26th we would also have 50% reduction but would be upgraded to a nicer room. 26 May We were charged $267.85 for the 2-night stay. We returned with high expectations of our upgraded room. It was 99 degrees in Phoenix and on checking in were told that there was a leak in the hotel's air- conditioning system but that plumbers were coming to fix it and should have it up and running within half an hour. We were first given keys to a room on the second floor but by the time we'd brought in our baggage the 2 staff at reception had changed it to 308 as they thought it had a better view. We clambered up in the very hot elevator to the third floor and took our bags into the room. On entering the bathroom we were horrified to see the stains on the floor. Apart from the stains on the floor the strip light over the sink did not work, there was no top to the pop-up waste in the sink so sink could not hold water, the lights and TV in the sitting area were oddly plugged in so that no lights could be turned on or off from the wall switches but the wall switch by the bedroom door turned on the TV! Although there was a second TV in the sitting area there was no remote control for it. We had the light over the sink replaced after speaking to reception but it was some time later in the day that another fan was brought up as AC still not working. As there is only one ice machine it is quite a hike to go down from the 3rd floor to get ice. The elevator makes a rather unnerving judder on the 3rd floor and so stairs were used when not carrying baggage. We went out to dinner and when we returned the AC was still out but we managed to get to sleep. We awoke at 2.40am and it was cool so turned off the fans. We were told at breakfast that the AC had been fixed at midnight. I didn't want to post a long list of gripes onto tripadvisor as the place as a whole is great and the staff are very nice indeed but it is let down by small niggles (and the amount of them) which on the whole I felt could be avoided if the staff were more on the ball. It isn't much good telling us that renovations are going to be done when we have travelled a long way for what we had hoped to be an enjoyable experience. We had also thought if our time at the Clarendon was nice that we'd return for Christmas but would need to be assured that the proposed renovations had taken place before chancing staying again. I emailed the hotel direct with my findings and on invitation from Ben Bethel, owner/GM, we were invited as guests 22-29 December to stay in a suite and enjoy the \u201creplaced AC system with a state of the art system - one of the best out there\u2026.. elevator cab is being completely remodeled, even with air conditioning!\u201d, new restaurant, and of course his pride and joy the new pool and waterfall feature. At the time this free offer was of a value of over $2,000. We booked a 3 week-long 3 centre trip with our last night prior to flying back to UK in an Executive Room at the Clarendon. In June 2007 the price quoted on the hotel\u2019s website was for $514 (including tax) for the night of 3 January. Nearer the time of our trip I found the price had dropped to $179 plus tax but was unable to contact the hotel by email as their mailbox was full. I therefore emailed Ben direct and he said he would look into it when he was next at the hotel in the following few days. We heard nothing further from him and so cancelled our booking and rebooked at the lower price. Arrived on 22 December at around 3pm after a 5 hour car journey from Vegas, our first port of call. Welcomed by Ben himself (although we didn\u2019t know until later it was him) who apologised for the boarded up hole at the front of the hotel, as they were awaiting installation of a new entrance. Another member of staff organised a trolley for our luggage. We were given room 215. The elevator had been remodelled in a very strange manner with white plastic sides, steel doors which caught when opening and a windowed back showing unattractive breeze-block wall of elevator shaft! On initial inspection of our suite we saw straight away that there was no TV in the living area, a chipped luggage rack which in May had been at the base of the bed was now being used as a coffee table, only 3 hangers and no bar of soap in the bathroom. We were unable to get heat in the room. We asked about these items on our way down to the restaurant for a late lunch. Soap and extra hangers were provided. There was no \u201cspare\u201d TV though for the second room of the suite. We were told someone was working on the heating. There were more pictures on the walls of the rooms than in May \u2013 unfortunately not level. We had a very enjoyable lunch in the new restaurant and Ben Bethel came and spoke with us and said how pleased he was that he had a restaurant after the lengthy and expensive court battle the hotel had been through with previously independent restaurant owners. We were given vouchers worth $10 per person to cover breakfast and were told to get a voucher for each morning of our stay. After lunch we went to the room to unpack and found many of the surfaces were dusty or sticky, the sofa was covered with crumbs, there was a used lint roller under one of the units and half of the little drawer space available was filled with telephone directories. The drawer space may well be sufficient for travellers living out of a suitcase or just staying one night on a business trip but is not sufficient for a lengthy stay. All other hotels on our trip had at least one if not two large 3-drawer chest of drawers for clothes as well as bedside cabinets. I went to get ice from the ice machine which had previously been on the first floor near the pool and was told by housekeeping that it was now on the 3rd floor. It was not working however (and was out of order for the entire 7 days) and ice was fetched from the kitchen by reception staff. Returned to the restaurant for dinner and were given a table by the large windows. There was no heating in the hotel and as it was 32\u25e6F outside the cold air from the window made us move to the centre of the room. Another couple said they had just done the same as it was so cold. Having read on tripadvisor that a guest in November was cold when it was 43\u25e6F and the hotel had said it was too early to switch on the heating I had emailed the hotel to mention my concern that there would be heating, as last year it snowed at Christmas in Vegas. After complaining to reception we were given their oil-filled radiator to take up to our room. There is no dividing door between the bedroom and living area of the suite so it is a large area to heat with a small radiator. We huddled under the bedcovers and watched the TV hoping the heating would soon be fixed. (It remained off for 6 days). The hot water in the bath/shower was not very hot and we never got hot water in the sink so my husband had to shave in tepid water all week. I don\u2019t know if the water problem was linked with the heating problem. The next morning we went to get our breakfast in the restaurant and sat down at a completely bare table (no condiments of any description). After half an hour we got some coffee but had to repeatedly ask for milk for it and after getting a small jug of milk another waitress brought me a glass of milk. When I said I hadn\u2019t ordered a glass of milk but merely some for my coffee she responded that I wouldn\u2019t be charged for it! I ordered a power breakfast but there was no granola and so asked for an English muffin (out of those too), a poached egg (could only have 2) so ended up having white toast with 2 small greasy slices of bacon. My husband ordered sourdough toast but got plain white. This entire process had taken an hour and we were through our initial coffees by the time the food arrived and were given a look of horror by the waitress when we asked for a refill of coffee. A couple at the next table were served cereal in take-out containers (not in a bowl) and given a glass of milk to pour over it as \u201cthey were out of jugs\u201d! Not an experience we wished to repeat so did not use the restaurant again. I used the guest computer to check my emails and there was one from Ben offering all rooms until 30th December 2007 at $89 per night. The value of our free stay had gone down from over $2,000 to $623! I also sent an email asking whether a B&B we\u2019d used the previous May had last minute availability as despite the Clarendon being free board it was not shaping up to be the enjoyable, relaxing experience we\u2019d envisaged. The following day I had a reply saying they were full and it was lucky I\u2019d checked as the guest computer was out of service from then onwards. For some reason our room was never cleaned before 4pm and on Christmas Eve we were given 2 sets of clean towels so expected we were not to have housekeeping on Christmas Day. We had decided to make the best of it for Christmas and bought food on Christmas Eve from Safeway (they were closed on Christmas Day) and had planned to have a picnic on the roof. There are tables, chairs, sofas on exterior carpeting on part of the roof accessible via stairs from the 3rd floor. Unfortunately it was too windy to do so and so we dragged the small telephone table into the bedroom and using the one dining chair and bar stool seat we picnicked in front of the TV in our bedroom. Housekeeping arrived after 4pm and I gave her $5 to take out the garbage. On our last night at the hotel we arrived back at 6pm after a long hike and wanted to wash and change for dinner and the room hadn\u2019t been cleaned so I had to go to reception for fresh towels. At 6.15pm housekeeping asked if we wanted service but by then we just wanted privacy. We found by accident a Marriott Hotel on Central Avenue and went in and asked for their rates and to see a room. For the night of 3 January when the Clarendon wanted $179 for the Executive Room we got a room including fridge, microwave, breakfast etc. for $152. We booked it and cancelled our night at the Clarendon. The Fairfield Inn Marriott is opposite 3 good restaurants and close to the Heard Museum. Having had it in writing from the Clarendon that their chauffeured care would be available we had asked to be driven to a restaurant in Central Avenue as we did not want to drink and drive and were told that it was no longer available but that they could call for a taxi. This was not notified to us prior to our arrival. The Marriott not only has this 5 mile radius free service but also collects and delivers guests to the airport. Our stay at the Clarendon did not ruin our holiday and we did sleep well and our room was quiet but I can\u2019t say it added to its enjoyment. We used to dread returning to it each evening to find out what wasn\u2019t working next and whether or room had been cleaned. I am sure people will be amazed that I have complained despite our stay being free but on hearing remarks from fellow guests who were also not at all happy with their experience I thought my observations would hold more gravity as a warning to others as my stay was free. I would not stay at this hotel again and would certainly not recommend it to anybody. I am amazed at how this hotel remains so high on the tripadvisor list considering the many bad reviews it has had since our first stay in May. At the very least one expects from even a Motel 6 to have a clean room, hot water, air conditioning/heating, ice, toiletries and when guaranteed the best price when booking direct to pay the best price on the day. In my opinion this hotel is run for the convenience of the staff and not the guests. On reading remarks from other December guests on tripadvisor I noticed that one remarked on the access door to the car park was not secure and Ben claimed that it was not broken. It may not have been broken but was open throughout our visit as we went in and out a couple of times per day and it was always on the latch.", "Date": "January 27, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "California", "Title": "\u201cA hotel with a personality disorder\u201d", "Author": "AEricson23", "ReviewID": "UR12624421", "Content": "I visited in December 2007 and had a fairly negative experience.

Although Ben Bethel will write back with defensive excuses, as I saw he did to my mother, I will give the truth from my perspective: - It was very cold in the room. I called guest services to ask why the heater in our room was not working and they stated that \"The days are still very warm in Phoenix so the hotel has not yet setup it's heating system.\" I then asked if they even had a spaceheater and the did not. I am from Flagstaff and feel like I have a pretty good tolerance of the cold, but this was ridiculous. - The \"breakfast\" (if you can even call it that) was truly only bread--muffins and bagels (not even juice). I am curious to know what this \"upgrade\" could possibly be in December. Anything is better than what it is currently. - The neighborhood is not nice. I saw a gun shop just five blocks away. Lots of construction going on with the roads as well, but at least not directly where the hotel is. - Was not very impressed with the smell of the hallways--did not get an overall feeling of things being 'fresh'. - The bathroom in the \"executive suite\" (supposedly an upgrade--I wouldn't want to find out what we had before) had a shower that was impossible to change the heat settings for unless you struggled with both hands pushing hard one direction or another to change it. Hope you like the temperature you finally get it at because it's nearly impossible to change after it's on.

We were cold, and when we called the desk, we were told that the Phoenix weather was not cold enough to turn on the heat yet. They offered no assistance. 2. The bed was facing the window, and there were many streetlights on the outside which lit our room throughout the night. No drapes, just a flimsy shade covering the window, causing me a great deal of grief, as I could not sleep well all night. 3. The free \"breakfast\" as described on the website, consisted of bagels, packaged cream cheese, and store-bought muffins with coffee. that was it. No juice, no fruit. Blah. What a disappointment. And yes, there is nowhere to sit when you get your food off of the small table it sits on. 4. And last, but not least, the artwork was very strange and offensive. There is one wall near the lobby elevator with 3 pictures of a nude woman by a pond, and on another wall, a series of about 100 pictures of another naked woman, I believe holding a pitchfork?

Driving up to the hotel; there is no other way to describe the hotel building other than an ugly, ugly, cinderblock, 70ish, old communist bloc look. Not much they can do about it. Checked in early (no problem) with Justin; he was nice. This is a motel, not a hotel. Rooms all have external entrances around a pool but I would hardly call this a \"villa\". From the pool, the place looks like a quasi-dorm block/military barracks (I have stayed in both in my lifetime). Stayed in a Suite; the decorating is minimalist and quite frankly, I kind of liked it. The problems with my room were #1) Opening the door to the room and the room is damp and dark. The dampness I believe is due to a swamp cooler system and all the walls and ceiling being concrete/cement. Since none of the windows open, (which is necessary when operating a swamp cooler), the moist air just sticks to the concrete walls and the carpet. I don't like swamp coolers #2) A mold problem in the tiny cramped bathroom of the room I stayed in. Alot of hotels seem to always skip the bathrooms during remodels; this place is no exception to that rule. #3) No glassware in the room. Come on folks, at least one glass (and I mean glass) on the very nice bathroom sink is expected. (Jason did bring up glassware within ten minutes after calling down; thanks Jason.) #4) Pictures on the wall were in bad shape. #5) Fridge needs to be defrosted. #6) Breakfast was a doughnut or a cheap Danish and coffee if you make it in time; no juice unless I missed it. Bananas are cheap, nutritious and easy to handle; might want to consider putting out some bananas. #7) Coffeemaker in the room is one of those that drips all over the place when you try to pour a cup of coffee; learned this quickly and poured my coffee in my plastic styrofoam coffee cup over a very nice bathroom sink. #8) Restaurant is not open and should be noted on your website that it is not open nor has it been open for a long time. Pluses for me were #1) As mentioned in many reviews, I loved the bed. It was extremely comfortable and I slept like a rock. #2) The room was well sound-proofed and quiet. #3) Covered parking in Phoenix is a treat in the summer when the temperatures exceed 100. #4) I liked the location and felt safe in the neighborhood. It was centrally located for me and not on one of the major crazy Phoenix thoroughfares. I hate Phoenix traffic; everybody drives way too fast. #5) Justin was pleasant as were the two young gals on the evening shift. Thanks for the extra coffee!

The restaurant that's advertised to be in the hotel was closed and an employee told us that it has been under construction for the entirety of her employment and had no idea when it would re-open. Our room didn't have any of the advertised movie channels. I called downstairs to ask because I thought that maybe I made a mistake and a man told me that we in fact did have HBO but couldn't tell me how to get this channel. Next, our hot water didn't work and wouldn't turn off - it just dripped all night. There was an empty wine bottle under our bed (that we didn't drink or bring). The toilet felt like it was not bolted down, I'm not a plumber so my best description of it would be that it was wobbly. Needles to say, we didn't want to spend anymore time at this hotel so we cancelled the rest of our reservation.", "Date": "August 1, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chevy Chase, MD", "Title": "\u201cCustomer Service is Tops at the Clarendon\u201d", "Author": "RLJComm", "ReviewID": "UR8273317", "Content": "My party of four stayed at the Clarendon July 6-8 to attend the UOP graduation ceremony. Overall, we had a good stay. I enjoyed the color scheme of the rooms and the hotel in general as it reminded me of Southwestern flavors from my time living in California and Texas. The rooms were clean, the beds were extremely comfortable, and we enjoyed the continental breakfast. Customer service is great at Clarendon thanks to Justin - he is The Man. Clarendon offers free local transportation via hotel vehicle driven by one of their staff. Justin made sure that we were driven to breakfast, to the drug store, to Arizona Center, and later in the evening back to the hotel. When we wanted to switch rooms at 11PM because it was just too hot up on the 4th floor to get some sleep (we had a 6AM flight back - I have since been told by the hotel folks that they are putting a new roof on that will greatly reduce the heat on the 4th floor), Justin found us another room on a lower floor right away. And when my wife left some garments in the other room, he made sure we got them as soon as we alerted him to the situation. That Saturday, July 7, I think Justin must have worked 16 hours as another employee didn't make it in. It didn't matter if we needed him at 10AM or 11PM, Justin provided top quality service and our group appreciated his time and attention. I recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a comfortable, clean hotel with staff second to none. I will stay at this hotel again should my business take me to Phoenix. R.L.

I use the term hotel very loosely. I'm saying this because I am of the understanding that the difference between a hotel and motel is that the guest enters the room of a motel from the parking lot (outdoors) whereas a guest of a hotel must enter the room from an indoor corridor. You do not directly enter this \"hotel\" from outdoors but the rooms are arranged in a type of villa setting. If that's your thing cool, but I was not prepared for that. For the $150/night myself and my two co-workers had to shell out for our rooms (for four nights) I expected to have a corridor. Anyways there were many many things that went wrong during this trip. First of all the heat was not working at all. Our rooms were extremely cold at night. We kept complaining but were told that it was being worked on. Finally on the third night we were offered extra blankets, only there were only two blankets and a space heater. I got stuck with the space heater and while I was drying my hair the breaker for the room got tripped. When I went to the desk to get the power turned back on I was told \"you shouldn't have been running the space heater while you were drying your hair\". Like I was supposed to know that the room had poor wiring. If they had just apologized for the inconvenience instead of blaming it on me, I wouldn't have been as upset. Then there's the issue with the \"Shuttle\". We did not rent a car b/c we thought there was this great shuttle. Hardly. You had to sign up for the shuttle the evening before for the time you needed to be dropped off and picked up. So I'm sure you can imagine how difficult it is to get the shuttle for dinner if you are staying with people who don't make up their mind where they want to go to dinner until like an hour before their ready to go. We ended up taking cabs pretty much everywhere. Then on our last day we were told that the shuttle could drop us off at our meeting and then pick us up when we were ready and take us to the airport. I specifically asked \"even if we've already checked out of the hotel\" and the response was \"oh yeah that's fine.\" Then the last day comes and we are packing our suitcases into the trunk and ask the driver to make sure and he says \"Oh no. I'm not allowed to pick you up after you've checked out. There is too much liability\" Whatever that means. The point is the staff was not very competent, during our trip. We were offered a discount for the inconvenience of the heat not working, but that does not make up for the incompetence. Anyways there is more of the same that went on but I will stop here because it's just making me more upset just thinking about it. All in all I will never stay there again and I will definitely not be recommending this place to anyone.", "Date": "July 19, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Houston Texas", "Title": "\u201cGreat service! - comfortable room - great bedding!\u201d", "Author": "TUGhil", "ReviewID": "UR7974430", "Content": "Enjoyed stay.

I hate to say this because it sounds like the manager is a nice person and the service was good, but the hotel is a bit creepy. This is certainly a case of a hotel website description and photos being misleading. I ceratinly agree that for the price, we should not have expected the Ritz Carlton. However, hotel rates in Phoenix are not outrageous as it is, and their rates somewhat reflect the going market. Therefore, you are not getting a great deal staying at the Clarendon. Yes, when we checked in, the restaurant was closed due to water damage - no big deal as we did not plan to eat the hotel. Our room was quite musty and very dark. We settled in and decided to freshen up before heading out. Unfortunately, the toilet would not flush. We called the front desk and they sent the maintenance man up (he arrived quickly and was very nice). He told us it was part of the problem that several of the rooms had and moved us to another room. The second room was equally dark, drab, and musty. Yes, the toilet worked in the second room but the shower did not. We could not control the shower temperature and were burned everytime we got in. At that point, we didn't want to move our rooms again so we dealt with it. Also, I the shower knob was broken so I had to have my husband turn the water on and off everytime I showered. Again, we could have called and been moved again but we did not want to deal with the inconvenience again. The mini-refrigerator, metal furniture, and odd lighting choices gave me college dorm flashbacks. The rooms are not cheap and chic as they would lead you to believe - more cheap and yucky. The location of the hotel is a bit odd. It is in the middle of a not so great neighborhood (transients hanging around outside) and there is no secure parking for cars.

For $109 per night, I think that this hotel is a terrific deal. On the positive side, the room was very clean, recently renovated and had an outstanding quality bed and pillows. The new flat screen TV was terrific. The free local and long-distance telephone service turned out to be a real asset. The work space and closet were great. The Aveda amenities were a plus. When I came to my room both nights, music was playing and the lights were on. While this was in some ways a pleasant and ethereal effect, the environmentalist part of me wishes that they would save a few cents on electricity and just leave one light on. There were three bigger issues. First, the WiFi did not work in my room. That turned out to not be a big deal as I could use my Treo to access the internet, but I can imagine for some business travelers that this would be very annoying. This needs to get fixed or the hotel needs to not put people needing WiFi in rooms that do not have functional WiFi. Second, the AC did not work well in my room. Despite turning down the temp, I was really not able to get the room to come to a comfortable level for sleeping. The staff suggested I turn up the fan; quite honestly, that just made more noise but did not solve the problem. This is an issue the management really needs to fix. Third, the \"continental breakfast\" is pretty bare bones -- coffee and muffins. The bran muffins were really good, but that was about all there was. In addition, a sense of disrepair was reinforced by the fact that the restaurant was not operating due to water damage. So, to get dinner at 8:00pm, I needed to walk four blocks over to Central, where, in fact I had a terrific meal at Fez. I did not find the area unsafe or a problem, and the desk staff correctly assured me it was not. However, there were few people on Clarendon, so for some I can imagine it could be a bit spooky. Finally, on a positive note, the desk staff did a great job of getting me a limo that knew how to avoid the morning rush hour traffic and get me to Sky Harbor in 15 minutes.

I just completed a two night stay at the Clarendon. Overall, it was a very enjoyable experience--above all because I kept my expectations in check. In short, the Clarendon is a quirky, boutique MOTEL-like property, with a truly wonderful staff that makes you overlook--and forgive some of the problems you may encounter. At no time did I confuse (or attempt to compare) the Clarendon with the W hotel, or other up-market hotels or resorts (as others before have). But then again, I paid considerably less than I would have at such other hotels. Yes, the beds are wonderful (and perhaps are the same as used by Ritz, or the Four Seasons), the linens/towels are high quality (certainly well above a motel), the bathroom was kitted with Aveda bath products, and the flat screen TV in my \"junior suite\" was nicer than the one in my home. These were the amenities I truly appreciated and which make the Clarendon better than a motel. However, the basic feel and layout is that of a motel. The size of the bathroom was awful. Not until the final morning did I finally get hot water in my shower; the rooms and hallways (though painted in funky colors and motifs) are disgusting concrete; there is only so much anyone can do with that. The air conditioning was a joke ( the temperatures were already soaring above 90 degreees outside and the room air conditioner could not keep up. I cannot imagine what it will be like in the Summer). If only the water in my shower was as warm as the air from the air conditioner. The restaurant and bar was closed during my 2 nights stay, and the workout rooms were dark and dingy. Finally, the staff is not set up to accomodate business people. The fax machine ran out of paper and I had to bring that to their attention when I did not get my complete document, another time when I had to send out a fax, even though I brought it down at 5am (which should have indicated some degree of urgency to get it out), the staff did not send out the fax for 3 hours, and finally, one fax that I received on my first day was not presented to me until checkout! The only reason I did not \"loose it\" was that I had just been presented my bill, which was ridiculously reasonable. You are not \"nickeled and dimed to death\" on phone calls or other service charges here. And as I said earlier, the staff is so nice, so helpful, and so eager to please (though they may fall below the mark), you cannot get angry at them. So, all in all, as long as you are not expecting to stay at the W hotel, or a resort, but instead are looking for a great central location, very reasonable prices, and some nice \"extras\" that make this property well above your typical motel, you will be content. The next time I am in Phoenix, if I can afford (or am willing to splurge for) the Biltmore, I will stay there. But if not, I will be happily returning to the Clarendon.

I think we were disappointed because we had too high expectations based on some of the better reviews from Trip Advisor. We should have headed the warnings of most of the reviewers. The reality is that the Phoenix/Scottsdale area is such a tourist mecca (not entirely sure why now after our experience) that the cost of accomodations is extremely inflated. I guess with the comparison of costs of the other major resorts and high end hotels we got what we payed for at the Clarendon. We do agree that it is basically a somewhat renovated motel. They still need to do alot of work on the place. Perhaps with their efforts hopefully it will improve.

The rooms have old, dirty carpetting. The walls are paper thin & you can hear every noise taking place in other rooms & outside the hotel. The bathrooms are very small. The sink area is placed in the bedroom and their is NO counterspace. The good news is the mattresses appear very new and the beds are very comfortable. The furniture appears to be clearance items purchased at IKEA and is very postmodern but not very useful. The lobby is also an assorted mess. Instead of a front desk, they have, well a pair of desks! B/c of this setup, you can overhear every phone conversation. The one wall consists of 4x6 pictures of a naked woman with full frontal nudity. This is totally inappropriate outside of an art museum. Their is a continental breakfast put out each morning, however, I did see some good sized roaches crawling underneath the table where this is put out.

I have so many complaints about this hotel it's hard to know where to start. The overall \"theme\" of this hotel seems to be \"trendy boutique\". Ha. It's more like a motel 6 with different colored paint on the cement walls. Granted, the sink in my bedroom was a slightly upgraded sink, but it's still a sink in the bedroom. We got there in the morning to be greeted by mattresses lined up outside the hotel. Seems like all the rooms were not finished yet. There were major problems at check in with some people not receiving their rooms until 5pm. I guess those were the rooms they had to finish building. One guy in our group had to lay a towel in his bathtub because the grout, which was still wet, kept coming off. As for the free internet, it is free but it doesn't work. The only way I could get a signal in my room was to stand by the door and hold my computer up and even then it kept going in and out. For people who like their room dark while they sleep, good luck. Curtains aren't \"hip\" at this hotel. Instead they have this painting that one pulls over to cover the window. Fine but it doesn't cover the whole window. I had a one foot gap at the top which was very annoying once the sun started to come up. Although, when I think about it maybe that doesn't matter as I wasn't able to sleep very well anyway. There is no air conditioning at this hotel and the room was stifling hot during the day and at night. Yes, you do have aveda products in the bathroom. I would have traded those in for a shower that works though. More water was coming out of the bathtub faucet than the showerhead. And that upgraded sink in the bedroom? They didn't upgrade anything in the bathroom. It took me asking 4 times throughout the day for a tv remote that worked. It would have been faster for me to walk to the nearest shop and by the batteries myself. Although from the look of the surrounding neighborhood, I wouldn't want to walk. This hotel is not in a decent part of town and is not near anything. They do have a shuttle car service but it's one person and one small car so if he's out somewhere else you have to wait. The gym needs a lot of work but it does fit into the motif of the whole hotel needing alot of work. No towels or water fountains so bring your own to the gym.

On the minus side just two things to add to some stuff that has been said: Our non smoking room has obviously been a smoking room in earlier days - or some guest smoked anyway... that taste of old smoke in the air disturbed me a lot, but not my two friends who were in the same room, so we stayed in there anyway. There has also been some above average noise from A/C and a nearby generator on the street or something similar all night, but a) that's probably a temporary thing and b) we're in a downtown location where such things are to be expected.

I was in room 309...a large suite. My experience with hotels runs the gamut. From suites at the grand hotels of Europe (Le Sirenuse, Claridges, the Adlon, the Crillon, the Goldener Hirsch, etc.) to exceptional US properties (various Ritzes, Waldorf Towers, Auberge, Post Ranch Inn, Bacara, etc.) to boutique hotels, as well (Sydney House in London, Arcotel Velvet in Berlin, Blakes in Amsterdam, etc.). I share this because Clarendon gave me an entirely new experience, which I did not really think possible after decades of travel to hotels big and small, great and good (and yes, some downright lousy). Travelers to the Clarendon should prepare themselves for a hotel that is not sizzling with high-end design (although the rooms are pleasantly appointed and the whole place is VERY clean). But the design that is there is really cool. LED desklights, sliding shades that feature reproductions of the artwork in the lobby, enormous rooms, an exquisite sound system playing big band and jazz standards by the pool, the same sun chairs I lounged on in Positano earlier this summer and the exterior painting and lighting all conspire to delight. You aren't going to get a Phillipe Starck tour de force here, but you will get a feeling that the owners care enough to provide you with far more than the average Holiday Inn. But enough of design, because what the world DON'T need now is a design hotel without the basics nailed. And this, dear readers, is where the Clarendon knocks 'em dead. Service. What a tragically underrealized concept in hotels today. But the staff at the Clarendon could school the buffoons at MUCH higher end properties in what service means. Always greeting guests. Always asking if they can do that one extra step to help? Always producing the unexpected (for instance, with the no liquids rule at airports, we found ourselves without sunscreen. Would the desk have a bottle we could use? You bet they did.). And this wasn't just a bunch of hip young people helping out other hip young people. I observed several much older guests receiving the same level of truly engaged and respectful service and that just made me feel incredibly affectionate toward this property. The ability to experience design and a unique interaction with it should be the province of all ages, not just 20-somethings with the latest Prada swimsuit. The bed was top-notch. We did not use the TV. There is no liquor in the mini-bar (actually it's a mini-snack stack...there is no chilled beverage selection in the room). The A/C worked...not to an icy chill like many Phoenix properties, but it definitely felt much cooler in our room. The shower pressure was perfectly adequate. We did not use the bar or restaurant but peeked in and it looked appealing. The property is very close to many restaurants, bars, clubs in central Phoenix (not to mention museums) so we tried some of those instead. I told the girl at check-out that I felt I had discovered the coolest youth hostel on the planet -- only it was for grown-ups. I still feel that way. It's a lower-budget-higher-design concept paired with the absolute perfect pieces of internal architecture: a genius bed, clean property, and staff who would fit seamlessly into the finest properties in the hospitality industry. I still love my Christmases at the Arizona Biltmore -- I'm a hopeless traditionalist in many senses -- but for any other visit to town, I am going to definitely stay at the Clarendon.

I felt like being a new yorker, we fit right in. We understoond and appreciated the kitsch and were happy that it didn't extend past the courtyard into the rooms. We liked the blinds so much that we bought the same ones in new york and installed them into our own place. You can see out, but people can't see in. The beds were very comfy and the design was really done well. Whoever owns this hotel obviously took care that every room had its own touch, which is more than I can say about most non-bed and breakfast type hotels. The aveda products in the bathroom were a nice touch. The courtyard had a jacuzzi and pool filled with beach balls. I lounged on a deckchair reading while they played electronic music. The breakfast was mostly yogurt and croissants with juice and coffee..I was happy with what they offered.
