The room we had was away from main building and had own kitchen, toilet/bathroom, 1 bedroom and a lounge. Because there was 2 of us we moved one of the single beds into the lounge to give us more room and make it easier to sleeep. The hotel has a nice breakfast, cheap internet and a sauna and gym area. This hotel is a bit far out from Berlin town centre and train is a far hike away.", "Date": "June 19, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, UK", "Title": "\u201cAlmost like renting a flat\u201d", "Author": "stephanuk", "ReviewID": "UR16404192", "Content": "This is truly an aparthotel with very spacious rooms. There is a proper kitchen area, a large bathroom with window and a large main room with seating corner. The style is a little dated and office like with vertical blinds. Booked through HRS it was very good value for money. But WiFi and breakfast are not included in the standard rate.
