Do not Stay here..... They have a no refund policy as well. Stayed in Room 210 for 3 hours and left. Room is totally infested. Did not notice them initially and it seemed okay for a 5 min look in the room before paying. I stayed in the room for 3 hours and they started coming out from the baseboards, pipe plates in the bathroom and sink area. Totally disgusting. Left after 3 hours could not stand it. Was very disgusting. Motel staff shrugged it off and said if no one tells them, they do not know and cannot resolve the issue. Wanted to switch rooms but was so disgusted, I could not stay there.

Or they must love nasty hospitality. This hotel is a where house, drug infested place. A bunch of low lives run it. They don't even know how to run a hotel! My mother unfortunately used to work for these nasty ppl and they fired her because they couldn't pay her anymore. Also they can't even pay their phone bill because when you call the phone is not in service. A lot of bums live there. Prostitutes live there! Crack heads! If you wanting to have a nice vacation and especially have kids do not go to this hotel! Just suck it up spend a little extra money on a hotel that's worth your safety and peace of mind.

I guess the price lures vacationers in but I rather of paid $39.99 a night at another motel then waste $24.99 at this motel. My husband and I were disgusted at the condition of the room, the ice machine was broken, and there was no vending machines. So we were trapped into buying items (ice and sodas) at the liquor store that is located in the same area where you check-in. Stay away please, and try staying at another motel near by.

Luckily it was only for 1 night. Admittedly it only cost $34 plus $5 key deposit. However, the room smelt dirty and musty, the toilet had brown stains inside it and black bits floating in the water, and it didn't flush. The bedsheets were stained and there were pubic hairs in the bed. My friend went outside onto the balcony for a cigarette to find smoke and flames from below. Initially we thought the room below us was on fire, but after calling 911 and rushing out of the room in our pijamas we found out that someone had lit a red millitary flare and wedged it under the room door below us. We tried to call reception (approx 11pm) but no answer. Reception was closed for the night. The police arrived and moved some people from the poolside who looked like they didn't have rooms for the night. We didn't get much sleep and couldn't wait to get out of the room in the morning.

The service is very nice, and the staff is always willing to help. I vacation alot in Florida, and just recently found this motel 2 years ago. I drove by it and walked in for a cheap motel because of a bad experience with a hotel up the street. I needed a room quick, and this was the cheapest I came across. The rooms are neat and clean. The bathrooms are bright and clean. I have not used the pool, but it looks nice where you just want to jump in. The beds are nice, and the sheets neat and clean. It smells fresh when you walk in. The air conditioner cools down the room very quickly. What a great hidden little gem! I love it, and definetly coming back in June to stay! Very close to Disney, Sea World and all other attractions. I like the location beacause of all the shopping and tourist attractions and restaurants. Excellent price for the quality of the motel.", "Date": "April 25, 2007"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Buena Vista Motel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g34352-d120253-Reviews-Buena_Vista_Motel-Kissimmee_Florida.html", "Price": "0", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">5200 Irlo Bronson Memorial Highway</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Kissimmee</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">FL</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">34746</span></span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "120253", "ImgURL": ""}}
