We know this area, so were very happy to find the South Shore Motel. The reviews I read prompted me to call and reserve a spot. It was GREAT! We had an ocean view in a room with the kitchenette and everything was neat and clean. The friendliness of the owners was a bonus.

We come almost yearly. The owners are so nice and the rooms are clean and nice. One of the things we love the most is that it is a small place so you aren't constantly waiting for the elevator or having to drag your stuff across the lobby. there is a kitchenette for lunch and breakfast, and it is fun to walk down to the pier for food. The beach isn't as crowded as up in Daytona, which is very nice. I always recommend this place to friends. It is a little old and dated but it really can't be beat for value. We always have a great time.", "Date": "March 13, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ontario", "Title": "\u201cJust Perfect!\u201d", "Author": "JNJOntario", "ReviewID": "UR59003369", "Content": "We have just spent a week here. From the minute we arrived our gracious host and hostess made us feel welcome and part of the \"family\". They always took time to chat or help out. The rooms are spacious and very clean. The room does not have wifi or a microwave, but you can purchase an internet card and you can purchase a microwave. The owners told us to go ahead and they would store it for us until we return. The motel is small and quiet......just the way we like it. We were so disappointed with our hotel last year, that we personally came here and 'checked it out\" before we booked. We advise anyone else to do the same. This motel is superb value for an oceanfront efficiency. There are 5 corner units that have a floor to ceiling bay window which provide an excellent view and lots of light. Thank You Ellen and Hans for a wonderful stay.

We're very familiar with the area and usually try to pick the old style mom/pop type places. Had a 3rd floor (there's only 3 floors) room with a kitchenette.

Be aware-it is very basic-bring your own shampoo/hair dryer/dish soap if you need them, but it's a great location and great price for an ocean front room. We practically had the pool to ourselves-the whole area seemed to be in a tourist slump unfortunately.

We come here to rest and relax and spend time with family and have not found a better place on the beach for that purpose.

The rates are reasonable, the rooms are always clean. The property is located just up from El Portal (beach access) so you can quickly reach the beach for driving if you wish. A Lifeguard is stationed each day on the beach within a few yards of this motel. Parking spots are one per room, and the number is assigned, so you won't worry about someone taking your spot. This is a small property, three floors only (no elevator). You can stay on the first floor if you need a handicapped accessible room. Non-smoking rooms are available. The pool is small (no diving). There are steps to enter on the shallow end, and a ladder for exit on the deeper end. There are two tables poolside, with a tiki-type roof, if you need a bit of shade. There are also plenty of lounge chairs. All the main building's efficiency rooms are ocean front. Deluxe efficiencies on the ends have an additional side window for expanded views. You will have a full size oven and refrigerator (no microwave). Some pots, pans, plates, cups and utensils are provided for your convenience. There are rooms along the side of the parking lot, but they only look out onto the parking lot (no ocean view at all on those rooms). The couple who own this motel are very friendly. They remember us when we call for reservations and are always pleased to see us. The maid has been with them for years and is also friendly. The three of them make us feel at home. They are members of the Superior Small Lodging group. You will enjoy the proximity to the Dunlawton Bridge if you are headed back to the main part of Daytona. Many restaurants are within walking distance (Red Lobster, Subway). Others are within a few minutes drive. There is a telephone and television, but no internet access or VCR, etc. So if you are looking for a quiet place to escape from the hustle and bustle...this is the place for you!", "Date": "July 21, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "perry,fl", "Title": "\u201cClean small hotel\u201d", "Author": "perry_fl_guy", "ReviewID": "UR13245835", "Content": "My family been staying at South Shore Motel for 10 years and love the area.

This was part of a 3 week trip with my husband to celebrate our 25th wedding anniversary. We really enjoyed our stay at this motel which is an older style property on the seaward side of the coast road. We stayed in one of the rooms overlooking the beach and would definitely return. The room was a good size and had 2 double beds with ample wardrobes and drawers. The kitchen was well equipped, the only thing it didn't have was a microwave. The swimming pool has steps down to the beach, so the view from our balcony was both pool and beach. Our morning routine was a walk southward along the beach to the Sunglow Pier, which took about 30-40 minutes at a leisurely ramble, and then breakfast on the Pier at Crabby Joe's, which is a casual bar/restaurant. What made the stay even better was that the owner/managers were always on site and were very friendly. They are a middle aged German couple and made us feel very welcome. They answered any questions and little problems like replacing a light bulb were attended to literally in minutes. Even the maid was friendly and asked us what time of day we'd like her to do our room, so that she wouldn't disturb us! We got talking to some of the other guests and it sounds like the kind of place that guests return to year after year. The location is ideal, right on the beach, area not too noisy but with shops and restaurants within walking distance. As previously mentioned the motel is an older property and some of the decor/furnishings were showing some signs of wear, but the whole place was spotless and we wouildn't hesitate to recommend it to anyone - as long as you don't expect the Ritz.
