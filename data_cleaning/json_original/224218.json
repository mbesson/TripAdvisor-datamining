Rooms: Typical Embassy Suites, 2 room suites. We requested and received a quiet room (away from the elevator on the top floor.) It was indeed quiet and clean. The decor is nice and relatively recent. Walls showing some wear at corners (peeling texture, paint in one area that didn't hurt anything but was noticeable.) Bath/shower combo drains fine when showering, but took quite a while to drain about 6 inches of water after baths. One evening the water wouldn't get any warmer than lukewarm for our kids to bathe, but was fine about an hour later when I showered. Beds were ok but not great, but I slept fine. Leisure: Free wifi in lobby for registered guests, but you have to pay for in room access. Pool was steadily busy but not overcrowded. It was freakishly hot one day during our stay (water temp nearly as hot as the jacuzzi, causing the entire room (indoor pool) to steam up and cloud all the windows. This was remedied by the next day. Out of pool towels on several occasions and it took quite a while to get replacements. Used towels strewn all over the place most days. My guess is that more families were traveling than usual and the standard housekeeping schedule for the pool area was not nearly enough. Precor fitness center (3 treadmills, 2 ellipticals, 1 recumbent bike, + free weights, etc., all in good working order and never crowded during my stay.) Area: Less than 1/3 mile from the Galleria, all kinds of restaurants within 2 miles throughout Addison area. Amenities: Good breakfast, Omelets/pancakes, etc. cooked to order. Free managers reception in the evening (drinks, snacks). The lobby has 2 beautiful swans that live in the fountain -- the kids absolutely loved them! Overall, we were satisfied and would return. A few maintenance issues noted above, but nothing that was a deal breaker. Staff were very friendly and helpful (as long as you didn't need pool towels in a hurry.) I spoke to management about this and he assured me they would take care of this.", "Date": "March 14, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sallisaw", "Title": "\u201cVery Pleased\u201d", "Author": "Karen M", "ReviewID": "UR125664510", "Content": "We stayed at this Embassy Suites for a family trip to Dallas.

The staff are very friendly and very helpful. There is ample free parking right in front of the hotel, and you can either eat in or drive/walk to a couple of nearby places, including the Galleria. The lobby of the hotel is very nice and they even have two swans who inhabit a garden style pond in the center. The happy hour is great! I found it very enjoyable to just grab a glass of wine to take up to my room and unwind, however, there were many guests enjoying the happy hour right at the bar and it seemed an enjoyable and inviting atmosphere. I ordered room service a couple of times and delivery occurred in a very reasonable and relatively short amount of time. The food quality was average in taste and presentation (I'd order it again, but wouldn't go out of my way to eat there). I had a couple of different salads and some appetizers. I also had only coffee in the morning, but there was a nice breakfast set up for guests to enjoy. The room was clean with the usual amenities. I did not use the pool or fitness center, but did take a look at the pool...it was in a nice room with good atmosphere, but the pool is pretty small (if you're planning to swim for exercise). I did ask at the front desk about running outside and they said it was safe and that I could run in either direction along the street in front of the hotel, but that there were no parks nearby. I did run outside and found the lights take a long time to change and the cars aren't messing around there...they go fast and take no consideration for pedestrians. Regardless, I enjoyed my runs because I could get outside and see the area a little bit. The weather was gorgeous (last week of January-first week of February).", "Date": "February 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "North Texas", "Title": "\u201cRelaxing night away from the kids\u201d", "Author": "homeschool7", "ReviewID": "UR123234278", "Content": "My husband & I spent Sun. eve. as an \"intown getaway\" here.

She seemed genuinely interested in us and our weekend plans, she even made some great suggestions of places to see and eat at. One interesting thing about this hotel they I have not seen at any other Embassy is they have Swans living in the fountain pools. Very cool. It appeared that the large wedding party that was there enjoyed them as well; the kids were very attracted to them. I ask Connie about the Swans, she said it was the hotels signature thing that would make guest remember who they were. I defiantly will.

There's a free shuttle to all of the many office buildings (and the GALLERIA) in the area that runs until 10 p.m. There's a CVS next door for the inevitable items you forgot to bring along. The room service lady, Carmen, made me feel right at home and fed me well both of the nights I was holed up in my room trying to beat a deadline. There is a volume control on the wall in the bathroom - you can listen to the bedroom TV while you're in the shower. How's that for cool?? A few minor \"cons\": The \"business center\" is one lonely PC loaded with one of those \"restriction\" packages - I wanted to pull up an urgent email attachment when I checked in, but no-go. No printer, either. Bummer. They say that they serve lunch, but when I tried to grab a sandwich on the way to my meeting there was nobody around to make one. Breakfast, however, is pretty good - omelets to order along with the usual stuff. Embassy Suites are nice hotels, sure, but this one is full of special little touches that give it a distinctive personality. If you're going to be in the area, I would recommend it overall.", "Date": "October 24, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tyler, Texas", "Title": "\u201cGreat Value , Great Location\u201d", "Author": "TylerREBroker", "ReviewID": "UR37942360", "Content": "We have stayed at this hotel at least 5 times.

I took my rental car and drove down to the Embassy suites, near the Galleria. not a very fashionable but a simple looking hotel with loads of services and things to do. The rooms are big and good, as I entered mine I was welcomed by a moderate size living room sitting which was clubbed witha small kitchenette and had a pathway to the bedroom. The bedroom was of big enough size too with good selection of channels on TV. The hotel had a good gym facility and a nice indoor swimming pool, though I could never try my luck at the pool. One thing I like about the Hilton Embassy Suites was the eye for customer service delivery, so in the hotel you have Laundrette's where you can go and wash your clothes on your own if you find hotel Laundry service too expensive, just popo the change, pop the clothes, go to the bar grab a few drinks during the Manager's reception time and hey your clothes are ready too. The team kids travelling with me used to do that, I somehow preferred to use the hotel laundry, saved me the effort of ironing the clothes. :) The only time when i didn't like the hotel was when the Laundry service lost one of my Boss shirt and the manager behaved helpless and didn't do anything about it.

They didn't act like it was an imposition. There are two swans in the lobby, and the staff doesn't freak if you get close to them. The lobby is so lovely and open with real trees and a fountain. Yet cozy at the same time. Always have cold lemon water set up for the guests. The morning breakfasts are delicous -- better than most hotel's continental breakfasts (and the breakfasts are including in the hotel price). there were made-to-order omlets, waffles, fresh fruit, bagels, yogurt, etc etc. Seriously, don't know why you would stay anywhere else when you can have all this for a reasonable price and have a very relaxing, stress-free and very Dallas experience (Galleria next door!! Right by the Dallas Tollway, access to everthing). Ample parking and you don't have to pay like the Marriott down the block.

This was done in September 2007. I also advised the staff that I would be a late arrival since our flight did not get into Dallas until 11:30 pm and by the time I got my luggage and rental car it would probably be between 12:00am and 1:00am. I was assured that the late arrival would not be a problem and that the non-smoking room with two doubles would be available. On the morning of my flight I again called the hotel to remind the staff of my late arrival. I was again told that my room would be available. My family of five arrived at the hotel at 1:00 am. I was told by the night manager that they only had one room available and that it was a smoking room. Since my 7 year old has allergies and is sensitive to smoke I asked the manager if anything could be done to get a different room. He said that the smoking room was the only one available. Because it was already late I decided to check the room to see if it was at least clean enough to stay for the night until another room would be availabe the following day. When I was shown the room, it reeked of cigarette smoke. The room was dark and dingy and felt like a cave. The furnishings were old and soiled. I told the manager that the room was not acceptable. He said that he was sorry but that was the best that he could do. I asked if I could use the hotel phone to look for another hotel. He told me that I had to use the pay phone. When I went to the pay phone, there was no phone book. I asked the manger for a phone book and he said that he did not have one. I remembered passing a Hyatt Place one block away. I called the hotel and they had a room available for less than what I was paying at the Embassy Suites. This is where we ended up staying for the trip. It was a newly remodeled hotel with oversized rooms and a 42 inch flat panel TV. I was dissapointed with the Embassy Suies managment for not even attempting to find me a room with another Hilton family hotel for my stay and did not seem to care that they had over booked their rooms. I returned the next two days to talk Carol Chandler, the general manager but each time I was told that she was not in. I also left my cell phone number for her to call and she never did.
