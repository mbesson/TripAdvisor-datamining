But after our first visit to the Monsignore resort in 2003, this has changed. We now have returned for the fifth (!) time, simply because it is so beautiful and offering such a relaxed yet comfortably luxurious atmosphere. No need to look further, it's all here.This year we stayed in the Beato Angelico villa, a remarkeably pleasant and comfortable place with authentic tuscan atmosphere, but yet with all the equipment to give a family a care free stay. This has been our experience with the other villas as well.The staff are personal and heartwarmingly kind, always there to make you feel at home, no request is too much. Big compliments to Serena, Annarita and Valentina, you certainly are making a difference, not only for us but for the children too! And then there are the dinners in the restaurant... always very tasty, the setting is nice and cosy, and we always felt very well looked after by Simona. I particularly liked the various theme menu evenings with typical tuscan specialities, but also for little children (ours are 5 years old now) this restaurant is a great place to be as well, even when they are very small.The resort facilities are fine; pools were a bit cold in early may, but the spa is great, the wellness centre well equipped, plenty of facilities for sporting. So, this place is highly recommended, we hope to be back sometime soon!", "Date": "May 25, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR356764695", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Art-and-Caro"}, {"Content": "Absolutely advised! What a pleasent and excellent stay, even for a guy who, like me, already lives in Tuscany and is therefore used to those magnificent sunsets and sweet landscapes.The staff is remarkably kind, the place is full of things to do (tennis / sauna / spa / soccer / many swimming pools / gym / horse-riding) and is of course very near to Florence (better jump on a train if you're traveling during holidays to avoid traffic) and many nice small villages.A special mention to Serena, the nice she takes care of everything manager.", "Date": "Apr 28, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR791243080", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Pepper74"}, {"Content": "The Most Romantic One!       courtyard", "Date": "Nov 29, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR839098324", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "melqueen"}, {"Content": "What an unforgetable holiday What a fantastic resort with a tremendous personal attention from the staff, esp for children, they want to return!! They can bike, horse riding, play football or volley......only we missed a basket.....The staff is very good and helpfull to make a trip to Firzenze, Siena or to a wine farmer close to the resort. The kitchen is based on Mugello menu's and we liked the Pasta evening on Wednesday. The atmosphere in the resort is very relaxing and the owner gives a very personal touch to your visit with a tour to his villa. FANTASTIC!!
