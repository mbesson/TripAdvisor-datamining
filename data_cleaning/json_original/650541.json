First, the best thing about this hotel is that it is less than a 10 minute walk from Central Station and Dam Square is a couple of minutes around the corner. The member of staff who greeted me was friendly and was actually expecting me. I paid 70 euros for 2 nights accomodation and even got a receipt which is like a little card with your check in and check out dates and which you need to gain access after hours. So, what did I get for 35 euros a night? I asked for a room with a view and when I booked the booking confirmation said I had a private bathroom. Well, my single room was right on the top on the fourth floor - actually the attic. The room was basic with a sink and I even got a towel and soap. There was a TV which switched on but had no aerial. There were 2 small angled windows in the roof, neither had curtains and the latch on 1 window was broken and the window was held open with a small plank of wood. On the 4th floor was one other room and we had to share a toilet and shower. The toilet was clean and had paper, but the light in the shower wouldn't turn on properly and the door didn't lock. The stairs from the ground floor were very steep. The hotel staff were always friendly when I saw them but I didn't think it was worth complaining about the defects in my room. I'd only recommend this hotel from people on a very tight budget who don't expect luxury, and I wouldn't pay more than 35 euros a night, because for the location you can't complain.", "Date": "June 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cover priced tatty rooms and surly service\u201d", "Author": "AliceCristal", "ReviewID": "UR109541523", "Content": "We knew we'd made a mistake when we were greeted by the barman with a rude: \"We're full!!\" When I told him we had a reservation he told me to \"wait 5 minutes\" with no apology.

Amsterdam was absolutely rammed over the Easter weekend and the Corner House was one of only a handful of budget hotels available when we booked 3 months in advance and the only one with three rooms available (excluding dorms/hostels). We booked out of desperation to have somewhere to stay despite having read some very negative reviews on here and I felt I had to post a review here to document our favourable experience of the place, if only to offer a bit of balance. It's not the Ritz but the accommodation was of a satisfactory standard, clean with towels, soap and shower gel provided. The room sizes seemed to vary quite a bit - two of us were on the fifth floor which only has two rooms on it (12 and 14). 12 is large and encompasses what used to be '11' (an extra locked door onto my room shows a wall has been removed - they would have been tiny rooms before) whereas 14 is a little over half the size. Our other friend was on the first floor and I didn't see his room. There is a shared shower and toilet per floor and the one on the fourth and fifth floors were clean and worked well (although the light flickered in the shower on the fifth floor). There is a strong family resemblance between the members of staff and they were certainly very warm in their greeting when we arrived. The bar serves as a check-in desk and we were asked to pay for the rooms in advance. We showered after check-in and arranged to meet back in the bar so we had the opportunity to have an Amstel there while we re-grouped - the staff were again full of smiles and very welcoming. We returned to the hotel a little after 9pm (the day's cycling having taken its toll) and the bar was now full but the staff gave us our keys back very quickly. Contrary to tales of sleepless nights, I slept like a log. The streets in the centre of Amsterdam are very noisy at night so I think being on the fifth floor probably helped to dampen it a bit - I certainly slept very well. I didn't get to try the breakfast as we checked-out first thing, keen to see a bit more of Amsterdam before we headed back out on the road. I would stay there again. By the way - there is secure bike parking at MacBike in the Centraal Station (east and west sides) for E1.20/calendar day.

The tram line does run outside the hotel so can be a little noisey, but when drinking in the evenings you dont tend to notice when you get in! It is above a pub - nice cosy vibe in pub with reasonably priced drinks. Wouldnt recommend the restaurant as its overpriced for basic food - i.e. 8 euro's for a basic tuna salad.

As they had already booked their accomodation and couldnt change to a bigger room , I was left with the unenviable task of findong myself a single room which wasnt too pricey, was safe and was also central. I had looked at a few others and came to Cafe Corner House. I found myself quite wary due to some of the postings and comments about this hotel on Tripadvisor. The room I booked was a single with shared toilet/Shower. I was given the room directly above the bar, and when shown to my room I was generally pleased. It was clean and it was most certainly safe, and I also had a great view from the window. Ok..maybe it was a bit noisy with the trams. However i have been to Amsterdam many times and this is almost always the case. In the room there was a small telly - with BBc1 - and a small sink and wardrobe with hangers. THey had also left me a bar of soap and a small towel (however I had taken my own towel as I always do) The manager was called Theo and in my honest opinion you couldnt have met a nicer person. He and his family are originally of Turkish descent, and they were soon talking away to me about life in general , maybe its a Scottish thing but I found each and every member of staff in the hotel to be friendly courteous and very very helpful. I have been to Amsterdam before and done all the usual pubs and trips with my pals and we had a great time watching the climax of the English premiership ni the Globe Sports Bar. We had also watched the end of the Scottish season the day before there and again the staff and the locals couldnt have been more welcoming. They even gave us a couple of free drinks when Bob and Rons team (Chelsea) won the premiership with an 8-0 win over Wigan. Also had a few beers and a game or two of pool in Cafe Mooy. Had more beers and a wee sing song as well as people watching in the Bar De Stoof. We tended to round off our nights by visting Cafe De Zon at Niewmarket , where Maartan - a good friend - will look after you and serve you beer until closing time. On the way back I had a few in the hotel with my pals and with Theo. As I have said you couldnt have met a nicer person. Tis was also the time of the Icelandic volcano blowing its top and causing disruption to flights. On the Sunday it had started up again and all the airports in Scotland had closed due to the cloud. I mentioned this to Theo as I was a bit concerned about having nowhere to stay. He took me to the side and told me not to worry as he would ensure that I had a roof over my head if I couldnt get home. it was a major relief to hear that as i didnt fancy having to sleep rough!! I hadnt taken my credit card or my bank card! i have said before about my room being directly above the bar. This was good for 2 reasons...I didnt have far to go after a night cap, and it was busy enough to wake me from my hungover slumber at 9am. Thus ensuring I didnt waste my trip lying in bed feeling sorry for myself. As luck would have it Glasgow Airport was opened on Monday and I travelled back to Scotland having had another exceptional weekend in Amsterdam. If and when I return then I and my friends will all be staying at the Cafe Corner House!

Staying at this hotel must be one of the worst experiences I have ever had. The staff were rude, lazy and abusive and refused to give a written receipt on checkout.

There is a lot of street noise very early in the morning which was only made worse by the loud music played late into the night. If you complain, there was NO response. The barman who seems like the only person in the place to oversee the guests hands out keys on request, so that security is non existent. The hotel reeks of tobacco smoke and clients often light up in the bar despite the law in holland against smoking in public spaces. The hotel manager (barman) was made aware that this was illegal under the Dutch laws but he could not care less. Toilet had no lighting and was located on a landing at the top of the stairs, which would prove very difficult for any special needs folk that required assistance. One has to squeeze past the toilet bowl, to enter the room. The shower facility was almost as bad with dated decor and positive smell of urine. The free internet WiFi does not work for more than 5 - 10 seconds, again the staff could not care less.

Over the years I have stayed in budget hotels and hostels in Germany and Prague and expected this hotel to be similar - I was very wrong. Yes it was in a great location, and yes I was expecting the very basic accommodation, but the service we received from the staff was abysmal. We went to this hotel on a girly holiday for New Year and on more than two occasions I was made to feel very uncomfortable and genuinely frightened by the male staff. After complaining about being put in a room which we had not booked and asking for the hotel to fix the rooms light (which did not work and remained broken through out our visit) the barman (as there is not a dedicated reception and any problems have to be discussed at the bar in full view of all visitors) became very hostile, when I told him there was no need to yell, he told me there was no need to stay. I have never experienced any service like this in the past. On our second night staying there we had an abusive phone call at 4am to the room, screaming because they believed we had male guests in the room ( which we did not) after the phone call, one of the barman came to our room and started yelling and screaming at us, as I was scared for my well being and not used to being spoken to like this by a much larger man, and worried about the other guests in the hotel, I kept apologising in hopes he would leave. After a ten minute abusive rant he eventually left. Loud music played every night till 4 in the morning (and we were on the third floor so God knows how the first and second floor coped) The only way we were able to sleep was by listening to our mp3 players every night- but I would recommend ear plugs. The photo's on here do not resemble the room or bathroom we had. Our bathroom was very old fashion, tiny and decorated in awful 1960's brown d\u00c3\u00a9cor.

The hotel itself is fine, if basic, great for the price. But we had a horrific experience with the barmaid, who verbally abused us and threatened my friend with pepper spray. I made reservations directly with Theo, the owner, via e-mail, and gave him my credit card as a guarantee. So, when we checked in, and the barman didn't ask for payment up front, we just assumed that since they had our credit card details, we could pay when we checked out. Unusual for this type of establishment, but not unheard of. On the third day, the barmaid called the room at 10:30 am and told us it was check out time. We explained we were staying another day. But when we went downstairs, she demanded we pay our bill. However, the charges were higher than what we had been told by Theo in the e-mail. When we told her this, she got this bizarre Stepford Person grin on her face, and kept insisting that we had to pay the amount she demanded, because it was written on the paper. She ignored us when we tried to show her our printed e-mails with a different rate. She refused to phone Theo and said he would be in later, and we could talk to him about it, but we MUST pay the amount she wanted right then. We decided to pay it, as we were concerned she would go into our room and possibly damage our belongings. We also told her we wanted to have a late check out, but of course, were willing to pay for it. She then said we could only do that if we paid for a full night, and the amount she wanted to charge was again much higher than we had been quoted by Theo for one night. When we returned that evening, the barman who had originally checked us in was there, and said not to worry, he mentioned that the barmaid was a bit crazy, and said we should wait to see Theo the next day, he would be in around 11 a.m. Well, the next morning, psycho barmaid again called at exactly 10:30 and demanded we vacate the room. We asked her to call Theo, and she refused. We said we were going to wait in the room until Theo came. She then came charging up the stairs, banged on our door and started shouting at us that we had to get out, someone was waiting downstairs to rent the room. When we said we would stay in the room until Theo got there, she replied, \"Wanna bet?\" and tried to grab our suitcases. I shut the door on her, and she shouted, \"You like pepper spray, [--]?\" In the end, another gentleman came up about half an hour later, with the barmaid and her Stepford grin in tow, and said he was in charge when Theo wasn't here, that he would refund the overpayment if we would please vacate the room. Which we did with pleasure. I don't think we did anything wrong here. This woman would not listen to anything we said (she definitely understood us, her English was fine) and just had this ridiculous sickly grin on her face the entire time she was abusing us.

Additionally, they require that you leave the key at the bar and show a card with your room number to receive your key. Well, while we were at the bar one night another guest asked for our room key and they gave it to him without asking for verification. Luckily after a few minutes he realized that it wasn't his room and asked for the correct one (this is when I realized what happened or I would have chimmed in earlier).

I stayed here in late May for a few days. I was charged 35Euros per night for the weekend a couple of weeks before my trip. I loved the location being just off Dam Square very central. The room was OK, clean, and big enough. I liked the views from the windows, being so central is rare for me. Honestly though with no breakfast incl. and my being a big coffee drinker, you need to add 10 Euros to this rate. The bathroom and shower were shared. Never did I have to wait for the shower and not signigicantly for the toilet. The atmosphere of the bar, a Dutch brown bar, I enjoyed, as I no longer go to bars in my life, so it was a nice experience, hearing the conversation, some of the folks were singing songs, and the music selection was to my liking especially later at night, alot of 60-70's songs, Dionne Warwick, etc. So this was no hassle at all for me, this noise from the bar. Since I never sleep much when in Amsterdam I had no problems with the street noise, which is a contant all night really, tho it tapers down after about 3am or so. Personally I was ready to retire on the hours they close the bar which is 1am weeknight and 2:30am Friday and Sat. It was shown to me how to buzz for entry after those hours. I am not sure what one would do to LEAVE the place after those hours. To get to your room the bar man gives you the key and it's a side door and staircase. I beleive there is a outside door in that area so maybe that is how you leave the room at 2am on a Thursday night. or maybe you buzz them. It wasn't explained to me. It coud be an issue for some or even myself in the future. They run a tight ship here and you don't have to be concerned about things like being hassled or other residents making too much noise or disturbance. My Tv was without a remote which is not a big deal. Most channels were Dutch with one or 2 from UK and CNN. good enough.

After reading reviews on here I was prepared for a frosty welcome, and well my experience was fantastic. We walked in and the bar was busy with locals singing along to europop oompah type music, the bar maid beckoned us to the end of the bar, shook our hands enthusiastically and welcomed us heartily. She found us some seats and offered us a drink on the house while we filled out our guest cards. I had booked directly from the email on the website and had no problems with our booking, they were expecting us. The rooms are all above the bar on 2 floors, our room, room 1 was directly above the centre of the bar, if you want a silent stay then i wouldnt pick that room, having said that once the bar closed at 2am (sat) / 1am it was peaceful and fine. The music starts up again at about 8.30am. Yes the staircase is narrow and steep but if you have ever been in any dutch building you will know this is the norm, and this one was better than many i encountered! What do you expect in a tall narrow old building!?! The room was VERY basic, 2 low single beds, a sink in the corner, and a TV. The shower and toilet facilities are shared and a little chilly at this time of year! Make sure you arent last one into the shower on a busy bank holiday weekend- there was no hot water left! This is sounding very negative and it shouldnt be. These are the only down points. The Corner house has so many good points and reasons to stay! It is VERY cheap, we paid 70 euros a night over easter weekend for the room not Per person. The next cheapest 1 star central hotel was over 90. Yes it is basic and old fashioned but it is very clean. The location has to be its biggest selling point, you really couldnt get more central if you tried in my opinion, you are 10 min walk from Anne Franks House, right on Dam Square and 2 mins from the shops. A 5 min walk from the famous red light area and everything is within reach in a few minutes really. It took us 15 mins to walk up from the station with our bags. If you dont want to walk, Trams stop outside the hotel at Dam stop. The drinks in the bar were also the cheapest we found in the weekend and the bar has a lovely atmosphere with varied and eclectic music, from Queen to the grease megamix and traditional Dutch oompah sounding stuff! It was great and everyone was friendly. The barmaid let us leave our bags down in their cellar for the day as we had to be out at 10.30am but our flight wasnt till the evening, very handy!

After we filled in our details, we waited and waited to be seen again, I then went to give my details in to the lady but she told me to wait a bit whilst she did something. Fair enough I thought because it was quite busy in the bar. The next thing I saw was her chatting with customers and then left to go home! I went up to the new person behind the bar (Theo) and I gave him my details and he seemed quite shocked that I hadn't been given my key to the room. He was very helpful and really friendly. After walking up the steep stairs (no lift), we found our room had 2 twin beds (We asked for a double but i'm not sure whether they are all twins) a cupboard, 2 plastic chairs, a table and a sink outside of the bathroom (which contained a shower and a toilet) and a TV with around 30 channels (inc. BBC1, BBC2, CNN, BBC World News, Discovery Channel and National Geographic as the English speaking channels). The room wasn't the largest but suited us as it was just a base to leave our stuff and to sleep. The bed was comfy but we only had 1 pillow each which weren't that great. Each day we were left some fresh towels outside our door which became a stand-in second pillow for me! The location of the hotel was brilliant. It was right next to Dam Square and is next door to the massive church next to the palace. It meant we didn't have to get up early to get to places as it was right next to everything we needed. Despite it being next to Dam Square, the hotel was quite peaceful and rarely heard much noise at night. The hotel was also next door to a cafe which served breakfast, lunch and dinner. This was ideal as the hotel didn't serve food. The cafe serves a great traditional breakfast...how do I know? Because I ate one every day of my visit! lol! Check out is at 10:30.

How wrong I was. When we arrived, and told the woman behind the bar that we had a reservation, she welcomed us by demanding to know how I had booked. When I told her that I had emailed she then said that we couldnt possibly have done that as the hotel didnt make reservations via email. When I told her I had emailed the owner, called Theo, she said 'Oh. Well, whats your name then?' She was SO rude to us; making me repeat my name 3 times, then saying there was no reservation, When I persued it, and said that there must be, as I had the print out of the email with me, she conceded that perhaps there was a reservation in my name. It was honestly the most bizarre experience I have ever had in a hotel; it was as if she REALLY didnt want us to stay. I should say at this point that both my husband and I were well dressed, completely sober (!) and very friendly and polite. Eventually she shoved a check-in card at me and demanded I fill it in. When I asked if that meant that she had found our reservation, she said very sarcastically that \"obviously\" that is what it meant. She was horrid! Througout all of this we were both incredibly polite, and it was just the starngest thing to have someone be so openly aggresive and rude, for no apparent reason! Once I had filled in this, she immediately asked for our credit card. Not being silly, I asked if we could see the room first, before paying for it, as to be honest the service we had so far was truly shocking and I had serious doubts about the hotel by then. She became even more aggresive at this request and literally threw the keys at me. In a state of shock by this point, I took them and went to look at the rooms. The hotel bit is above the bar and you have to climb a steep starcase to get to the rooms. There are many rooms, and the rooms we saw (some doors were open) were truly BASIC. Very, very old furnishings. It seemed clean enough, but was really Hostel standard. Twin beds, threadbare bedding and strip lighting. I had decided by now that there was no way on earth I would stay in this hotel, primarily because of how unbeliveably rude the woman at the bar had been. I think even if she had been the most welcoming and kind person on earth I would not want to stay in a hotel of that standard however. It was not good. We returned the keys and said we were not staying with them, primarily because of her attictude. SHe became very aggresive again and challenged me tofind anywhere else in Amsterdam to stay the night, shouting 'Good luck!' sarcastically as we left. We walked 50 yards down the street and booked into the nearest hotel, which unsurprisingly, was SIGNIFICANTLY better. All in all, it was the worst hotel experience both me and my husband have ever had. It actually left a really bad taste in our mouths regarding AMsterdam as a whole. I would not usually bother writing a review but I have to say as this experience was so bad, I want to prevent others from having to go through anything like this themselves.
