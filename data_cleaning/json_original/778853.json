Prior to arriving to this hotel we arrived into beijing quite late due to engine problems on the plane which cant be helped. When we arrived to the hotel we were greeted by bell boys who took our luggage from the bus and left the luggage at reception until we were allocated a room, message to everyone you must show your passport upon check in and they do keep your passport until you check out of the hotel this happened everywhere i have gone in China. This hotel had a certain smell through out the whole hotel, the smell was unpleasant through the whole hotel. The smell was like diesel or similar chemical. Got to my room the smell was even in the room, i had problems breathing throughout my stay i stayed at this hotel for three nights.The room was great apart from the slight issue of the smell, big rooms featured king size bed, my room had a treadmill, not that it was essential, fantastic pillows they were hard and the matress was hard great for my back, but if you suffer problems with your back it might not be so pleasant.I tried to complain about my room but very little english was spoken at the hotel, very hard due to the language barrier.Breakfast was great you had a choice of asian or western meals every morning, stay clear around 7am around the breakfast level as you wont get a seat, Chinese people are very early morning people and unless you want to be up at the crack of dawn try to avoid having breakfast at this time, try to have breakfast at 8:30am when the rush is over.Dont use the lift it is faster to use the stairs, if you have problems walking or need assistance this hotel is not catered for you.If your elderly this hotel is also not for you.Hotel is situated approximately 45mins out of the airport, be careful as beijing is a big city and is made of many districts, so you really cant tell if you are in the cbd of beijing.There is a great shopping mall, it will take a good 20min walk and has 07 levels of great shopping, be warned you cannot bargain in big department stores as they are owned by the government.I rate this hotel as an 3 star .", "Date": "Dec 2, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR126037423", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "aussieshielaNsw"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g294212-d778853-r21122325-Crystal_International_Jingdu_Business_Hotel-Beijing.html", "HotelID": "778853", "Price": "$140"}}
