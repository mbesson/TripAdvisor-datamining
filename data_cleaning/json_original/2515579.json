This property is truly in a beautiful area away from the strip, and felt quiet and relaxing. I felt like the problems were minor details and quickly remedied. I would stay there again!I read the reviews before we booked. It was funny how close it was to the reviews. The front desk was hurried and impersonal, the attendent typed at light speed and talked even faster. We asked for a king bed, and were given 2 queens, which they switched for us. The blow dryer didn't work in the room and they brought us a new one. I was excited about the deep bathtub, but the water didn't get very hot. I was unfamiliar with the wet bar and the caution to not take anything or I would be charged and not set anything on the bar or I would be charged, maybe this is typical practice.

As such , there are numerous issues that will be disappointing for a business traveler. 1) Rooms have no in-room coffee and no refrigerators. You'll need to walk through the casino to buy your own food and drink, or pay the expected high prices for room service. 2) Internet is $15/day and even then only works in your room. Don't expect to get wi-fi at the pool or in the conference rooms. 3) The business center charges $1/minute. Expect to pay at least $5 for your boarding passes. 4) Parking is free, but the garage adjacent to the hotel has very limited spaces. So unless you want to transport your own luggage through a casino and parking lot with no carts available to guests, expect to generously tip for both valet parking and bell service. So just be sure your company will cover most of the above when you book your meeting. Positives: Rooms are clean and modern - large wide screen TVs and separate imitation marble tub/shower.

I know our experience was probably quite different than people that stayed here on weekends- no kids and no crowding- we loved it! The rooms are really nice- quite fancy if you compare them to the average room on the strip. We took everyone's advice and asked for a room near the elevator and got one with a canyon view (also recommended). The casino was nice- medium sized and it didn't reek of cigarette smoke like some of the casinos on the strip. The best part about this place was all of the amenities that are available on site. They have a ton or restaurants, a movie theater and a bowling alley. The Yardhouse that is attached has a late night happy hour- cheap eats and drinks! They are also directly across the street from a nice grocery store and shopping area. We drove to the strip a few times from the hotel- about a 20 minute drive- but if we had not already booked shows, we would have stayed on site. Enjoy the pool on weekdays!!! There were zero children in the hotel the entire time we were there- and no one in the hot tub at all! We used a groupon so we got two nights, 2 breakfast buffets, and a $50 credit to the Sand Bar restaurant for $169 (plus daily resort fee and tax which equals $27+$10 per day). With the resort fee you get use of the spa, free in room internet and use of the pool, etc. The breakfast buffet was TERRIBLE!! That is why 4 stars instead of 5. The food was actually gross- and I ended up eating a bagel so I wasn't hungry. My hubby and I decided to forgo our second free buffet and head to the deluxe cafe the next day (delicious!!). The SandBar was also good- but DON'T order drinks there!!! They are super overpriced at $13 per drink!

It was a business trip but the conference was packed with free time and fun. This Hotel is large and about 25 minutes by the free shuttle bus provided by the hotel both from and to the airport and to the Strip. The bus leaves about every hour or so but it returns before 11p.m. from the STRIP for its last run....so that was not so good. The hotel is beautiful, very helpful, friendly attentive staff, especally the bell staff and the registration staff. You need a card to get on the elevator so safety is excellent. Gorgeous hotel, huge, classy, very modern the rooms. It's are spacious, clean and the bathroom has marble floors and TV, over the tub, separate shower stall, double sinks and leather type walls except in the show stall. Only issue was that the edges of the bed are sharp so you have to be careful, not to get your foot scratched as I did...could be a problem if you are a diabetic. Huge buffet with the expected sub standard food in the casino area. Lots of eating places at all levels and prices, There are two Starbucks. The hotel is located across the street from 2 fantastic shopping centers. It is near anything you might possbily need. This is a safe upscale area. The hotel gets its name from the RED ROCK park and the rocks are really red. Would I stay here again. Yes, if I went back to Vegas and had done the strip bit, this is a really lovely property to enjoy and relax. Our room had an awesome view of the strip at night. I am allergic to feathers and they changed everything, and I mean everything and did it with dispatch. Don't hesitate to go here. Every room is off of the main hall, so each room is entered from your own private foyer with only one other room across from you. This was my experience. If there was a negative, I thought the tile on shower floor could have looked more pristine, but it was not dirty just seemed a bit dull. This is a very, very clean facility. I was in a non smoking room , non animal room. Actually, I do not remember the policy on animals, but did not see any.

The place is beautiful and makes a for quite an impression when arriving. We stayed here because my wife does not like the strip and wanted to be closer to nature while visiting family. The resort accomplishes that quite well. The room was decent and overall the staff quite attentive. The spa was a life savor although the work out area was barely adequate when compared to other quality resorts. The Aria and Venetian work out areas in particular blow this one away. The Pool area is magnificent in its visual appeal, but from a practical point of view was a disappointment for my family. The main pool was freezing so few people where in it. Most of the activity took place in the so called \"hot tubs\" because the water was just luke warm in both tubs. As a result, they were filled with kids all of the time. My inquiry into this received the standard line that we are working on correcting this. It did not get corrected in the five nights that I stayed her. Prices for poolside drinks and food were typical for Las Vegas which seem to keep getting more out of control each visit. Two drinks for me and two lunches with beverages for my children ended up costing around $100. My main issue with the place was when I checked in the second time, the room assigned to me smelled of vomit. Apparently it was never checked for quality before assigning it out again. Fortunately, while I was holding my nose while on the phone to get a new room, the bellman came up and took care of it as he too was appalled by the smell. I was disappointed that there was no follow up with anyone in management after that to ensure that everything was acceptable. I even saw the bellman several times after that and he never mentioned a word. Upon checking out when I told the lady at the check out desk what had happened she was very gracious and did offer a small credit. It was to me a case of too little too late and really missed the point. I was also disappointed then when my neice who lives locally wanted to stay over I tried to get a roll in bed for her to sleep on. First I was told that it was extra which I said was fine. Then I was told that it was a fire hazard since I already had two queen beds so I could not get one. I ended up sleeping on the sofa. After traveling for over 40 yrs that was a first. So although it is a beautiful place, the management needs to fine tune some of their practices to truly make this place special.", "Date": "April 11, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Murrieta, CA", "Title": "\u201cVery nice for all ages\u201d", "Author": "DavidHitchcock33", "ReviewID": "UR127638827", "Content": "Hotel tips Canyon (pool) view is nice.

Don;t get me wrong, I love kids, but not when I am trying to relax. I know better as an Aunt to a 4 and 6 year old, I would never bring them ANYWHERE that was not geared towards kids. Personally I do not think Vegas is a family destination. The casino was nice and they had multiple 5 star restauarnts, but once you got off the elevator, smoke filled your lungs and again I would be DAMED to bring my child there. The Rooms are Gorgeous, facilities are gorgeous from the SPA to the pools. Staff is excellant, the only DOWNFALL was the 800 kids running around and splashing in ALL the pools. They have 5 pools available to everyone PLUS a spa pool for the spa users, a cabana pool for people willing to spend the money and an adult pool, which was not OPEN. There are two sets of Cabana's, one is private with a private pool roped off, which gets NO SUN for hours and the other has two nice pools, which kids are allowed in, so basically why bother paying for private if you cannot have private. The wait staff as nice as they are arent even old enough to serve the liquer, nevermind control the environment. Their outfits consisted of thong like bikinis, which is fine for adults but not so much for the kids. There are two jacuzzis, which were filled up by at leasts 15-20 kids all day, so noone else was able to use them and who would want to, since they looked green. Parents were completly oblivious to how their children were behaving and nor did they care. All in all the pool area is beautiful, but again there was zero rules. It was very confusing. They are either geared towards adults or kids... PICK ONE PLEASE. Couples would tend to flock together. We would all be at one pool and soon enough some family with 4 kids would walk over and take over the entire area, with screaming children spalshing and running around like little manias. ITS CALLED COMMON COURTESY PEOPLE. JUST BECAUSE YOU HAVE KIDS, DOESNT MEAN I NEED TO BE PUT THRU THE PAIN YOUR ENDURING. WHY SET UP SHOP NEAR 20 COUPLES? I am entitled to my vacation as well.

No. Overall, the stay was ok, but that was about it. I expected more from the resort considering it was all inclusive, but I would have rather stayed closer to the strip, so when I was bored, we could have at least left for a walk to another casino. Here is my breakdown; the resort was great at greeting you and saying goodbye, which is instrumental in insuring that you feel very welcome and the last thing you hear is a positive comment, hopefully bringing you back. However, the issue that I had was with the interior staff and the resort amenities. Positives: The valet was awesome! Well worth it you plan on staying and are not going to be in and out. In addition, the rooms were some of the best we have stayed in and rival some of the more \u201chigh end\u201d casinos. The theater was nice as was the casino itself; nothing big, just nice. In the casino, they seemed to do a great job of redirecting smoke, which was appreciated, and the cocktail waitresses were great. There was also a good selection of games ranging in price. In addition, there was a nice selection of restaurants and fast food places which was great for the adults and kids. Opportunities: I know they stated it was seasonal, but the pool was only opened from 9-6pm. It would have been great to sit out just after dusk and have a drink around a fire, or relax under the stars, but it closed down. In addition, they closed down the outdoor bars at 5:45pm, which is always frustrating to me. They should close when the pool closes, not before to usher people out (the drinks can be taken in). Also, the staff that worked the pool was not as pleased to be working there and were short with us on a few occasions. It makes it really hard to tip. Another issue was the interior staff as a whole. I think if the casino spent as much time preparing interior staff (bowling alley, pool, theatre) as it does on the front desk and players club staff, they would have a great establishment.

Yes, there are things to do at the resort, but not for days on end - it's a reality that MOST of the guests will want to visit the strip and with a resort that size, and that far away, WHY there is only ONE shuttle every TWO hours with limited seating?? Yes, first come first serve however thats not posted anywhere and once the shuttle broke down and we had an even smaller shuttle (18 seats) only which is certainly NOT adequate...cabs are $50 one way and that's ridiculous to have to pay that on a daily basis just to access the strip.

Since we are on a budget, we purchased a discounted 2-night package to the Red Rock Casino Resort & Spa, which happens to be just a few blocks from our home in Las Vegas, Nevada. The package included a 3-day and 2-night stay (Sunday-Tuesday) at the Red Rock in a standard room, $100 spa credit, 2 movie tickets (the hotel has a movie theater inside) and 2 breakfast passes for their Feast Buffet. We thought it was a great deal, but we just didn't know how great our short vacation would be. When our receptionist, Sarah, heard we were celebrating our anniversary, she thanked us for choosing the Red Rock and offered us a free upgrade to their Signature suite. She also upgraded us to VIP status, which gave us access to private elevators, private lounge with complementary drinks and a private pool area. Our suite was just divine! It had a large living area, with a comfortable sectional couch, a big screen HD TV, a bar with an empty mini-refrigerator (in case you want to bring a special bottle of Chardonay), a small table and an additional bathroom. Our bedroom was also spacious with beautiful views of the mountains, and in my opinion much nicer than the rooms on the strip, simply because it offered a more relaxing atmosphere. The king size bed was very comfortable and the bathroom had a chromotherapy jetted tub (by far my favorite feature) and a separate shower. The bedroom also had a big screen TV, a refrigerator filled with drinks and a snack a bar. For a daily service fee, which is charged by most Las Vegas resort hotels, we had access to in-room wifi, the spa and the gym, and we got the local newspaper in the morning. Needless to say, the room was spotless and offered some much needed amenities such as robes, slippers, a blow-drier, iron and iron-board, a magnified mirror in the bathroom, sewing kit, bath salts, cotton balls, facial tissues, Q-tips, and the list goes on. It' great not having to pack all this stuff. The spa at the Red Rock is very nice, we took advantage of our credit and signed up for a 50- minute couple's massage. Above and beyond the $100 credit, the spa also offered us, a 20% local discount. Since we had a $80 credit in our Boarding Pass (the equivalent to a rewards card), our half a day at the spa with a couple's massage cost us only $88, not a bad deal. The spa is not co-ed, but it does have a co-ed outdoor area which includes a heated pool. Both male and female spas have steam-room, sauna, a large jacuzzi pool, a rain shower, a small cold pool (it's great immediately after leaving the steam-room), a digital locker area with a machine to dry your swimming suit, showers and vanity areas with free bathroom products, as well as a relaxing lounge. The hotel gave us two additional breakfast passes, so we never paid for breakfast. The Feast buffet is huge and offer a great variety of food including Italian, American, Asian, etc. The only time we actually stopped at the VIP lounge and they were out of hot water, the hostess offered to send someone to our room with the water so we didn't have to wait. The staff was friendly and willing to help make our stay more pleasant in any way possible. We liked our room so much, we skipped the movies and spent a lot of time there, enjoying the beautiful views and relaxing in our spa. We enjoyed our stay and can't wait to go back and visit our new home away from home. If you come to Vegas, stay at the Red Rock if you wish for a fun, yet less hectic atmosphere.

While lounging by the pool during the day, we soaked in the breath-taking mountain vistas framed by brilliant blue high skies. Throughout our time by the pool, the service for food and beverages was timely and very friendly. The restaraunts onsite were all amazing; there was never a need to go \"into town\" in order to enjoy a wonderful dinner. The Valet staff were incredibly helpful as this was our first visit to Las Vegas. They helped us rent a car, catch resort buses to the Strip, gave us great driving directions to Hover Dam and the Grand Canyon, and made us feel like royalty. This resort offered everything we needed to escape from reality, see Las Vegas, sleep soundly in luxury, and soak in the fun and sun.", "Date": "March 28, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Florida", "Title": "\u201cWhat a wonderful hotel even though not on the strip...\u201d", "Author": "starjem66", "ReviewID": "UR126849874", "Content": "This hotel surpassed what I thought it would be.

We stayed there a year ago while in Vegas for our daughter's wedding and felt like it was such a positive experience that we had to go back. I'll start with the positives. The bell staff and the Valet staff are by far the best employees on this property. They will take care of you with a friendly smile every time. We had no problems in this area. There was some communication problems with getting the room we wanted but it all worked out once we moved from the initial room we were given. The rooms are spacious, comfy and well appointed. You have every thing you need. Love the extra tv in the bathroom, such a nice touch ;) There is a seperate shower and tub. The casino was loads of fun as usual and the smell of smoke is kept to a minimum. There are plenty of places to eat, you will not go hungry and if you get tired of Red Rock there are other places in the area to eat. We used the work out room and we found it to be big enough for what we needed, the spa area is clean and there is plenty of room to relax or jump in the jacuzzi or sauna. The hot tea and fruit are an added bonus. What I didn't like was the layout and the inconvenience from the shower to the lockers to the vanity area..Now for the negatives.... the lighting in the room is very bad. Every time I went to my suitcase I was searching for more light because you cannot see much in the room at night. The view is normally awesome out the window towards the pool area and Red Rock Canyon but this time..NOT SO MUCH! This was my chief complaint. When I called to book the room I specified that I wanted the pool view because at night when it's all lit up it is just beautiful to look at..well they happened to be resurfacing the pool while we were there and the pools over on our side under our window were all drained and we woke to jack hammers every single morning at 8 a.m. By the second day I'd had enough and I did call down to complain because not one single employee told me about this on my several calls to the property prior to our trip. The Feast buffet was good. You cannot complain about the food, not at that price. The food was always hot and good, but we were surprised that breakfast wasn't open until 8 a.m. which was an inconvenience on the morning we went out for a hike. Another big complaint above and beyond the pool situation was the cleanliness of our room. There was hair and dirt in the corner of our bathroom at check in. There was also hair in the tub..eww. The housekeeping staff did come by each day to freshen our room but that hair, etc never moved. Our sheets were never changed either. Do NOT touch the food on the mini bar unless you plan to pay for it. They warn you at check in so do heed those warnings! Room service is sllloowww, go downstairs to eat. The cocktail waitresses in the casino are hard to find but once you do, they deliver even if you move around ;) If you fly to Vegas and don't rent a car I'm not too sure I'd recommend staying at Red Rock unless you plan to stay put and not go to the Strip. It is pretty far from the Strip, there's a shuttle but we saw people lined up for quite some time waiting on the shuttle. We drove our own car to Vegas so going back and forth was not a problem for us. Overall our stay was fabulous. We will most definitely be back..hopefully sooner rather than later.

To gamble, business, vacation, etc. For me it was business. So this review should be taken in that context. First, let's start with the positive. This is off strip. So the property doesn't feel tacky or overhyped. It gives the impression of being an upscale property. The rooms are modern and nice size. There is plenty to do on property. Shop, eat, gamble, movies, bowling, etc. it is also very easy to get to from the airport. However, the property has a number of flaws. First, it is a maze. For a first time guest, I had a difficult time simply getting from the parking ramp to the hotel registration desk. No good signs showing the way. And keep in mind, I am a very seasoned traveler. Not someone who can't find their way around hotel properties. And once you get checked in, the elevators are hidden away in a dark corner. Also, the property feels like a combination of mall, casino, conference center and hotel. All patched together as if someone had done a series of additions over time. Second, the hotel rooms are dark. While they are modern, the lighting is pretty poor. There are also only 2 power outlets in the room. Granted, I'm traveling for business not pleasure. So trying to plug in a laptop, 2 cell phones and a internet card is a bit of a problem. Finally, room service has a problem. While the food arrives quickly, I spent 10 minutes on hold during my 2 calls. None of these issues are property killers.

Still, the Red Rock Resort is actually pretty nice, if that is what you are going to have there. Most of the slot machine were of the video poker variety, more than in other casinos we thought. There were surprise benefits of St. Patrick's Day when we were there, and a floor manager suggested we get one of the benefit cards and put it in the machine. When we did we each got one of the $25 bonuses. Which the machine all but immediately took back of course. The resort looks like a nice place to stay, but checking the rates quickly might suggest that you could get luxury there, but not a bargain of the kind to be had on the Strip.

This is the first time I have wondered if the Trip Advisor reviews were all genuine. The hotel food is terrible. We ate at the LBS cafe and also ordered room service. Both were highly overpriced with poor quality food. Room service ($58 for two sandwiches and one glass of wine) was particularly bad. Neither my spouse nor I finished our sandwiches. After those experiences, we found a local grocery store and sustained ourselves on supermarket food for the last night of our two night stay. The surroundings are unimpressive. There is nothing interesting within walking distance of the hotel, so, unless you want to take the half hour shuttle to the strip, you are stuck with the limited variety at the hotel. On the plus side, the staff is friendly and helpful, and there is good video poker in the Casino. Rooms are nice, bathrooms are great. The only reason to stay at the Red Rock hotel is if you are going to go out to the Red Rock Canyon area (which we did, and the canyon area is truly beautiful and a wonderful place to hike.... but we could have easily driven out to the canyon from the strip, and in retrospect, I wish we had).", "Date": "March 14, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Scottsdale, Arizona", "Title": "\u201cHotel Charges & Managers\u201d", "Author": "V E", "ReviewID": "UR126052945", "Content": "I have to say this is a nice property, the attitude of the floor management was terrible, they were rude to my children and family members.

It was basically the size of having 3 connecting rooms - a bedroom on each side and the middle living area room also had wet bar, dining table for 4 and a half bathroom. When you book through Hotwire they also hit you with a daily resort fee, which was $27.99 per night in our case and this included wi-fi. If you book directly through the hotel I think you avoid the resort fee, so you just have to see which works out to a better deal. It was still a good deal for us because the rates directly through the hotel for our dates of travel were $160 per room and we wound up paying close to that for the two bedroom suite versus just having two hotel rooms. We only stayed 3 nights and didn't get to use all the facilities of the property, but what we did get time to use was great. They have a very nice gym that we went to a few times and we always loaded up on the free bottles of water on our way out. We ate at the buffet several times because it was quick, cheap, and easy with the kids in tow. It was $6 to order a bagel from room service and $4.99 for the breakfast buffet, so kind of a no brainer to go to the buffet. It wasn't a bad buffet and for the price you really can't complain. This is a great place to stay in Vegas with kids. I only take my kids to Vegas when we are visiting family and I prefer staying off strip when I take them. This resort was great for us and I would definitely stay here again next time we take our kids to Vegas, but I still prefer the Strip area hotels for trips without kids. The only negative complaint I have is about the jacuzzi in our room. I never use jacuzzi's in hotels because I know they aren't cleaned properly, but my daughter begged and I told her I wanted to run it to clean the lines first. A ton of gross black stuff came out and of course I didn't let her use it after that. They really need to run some bleach through the jets on a periodic basis.", "Date": "February 27, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "brookfield", "Title": "\u201cThere is more to Vegas than you know!!\u201d", "Author": "darlene65000", "ReviewID": "UR125053705", "Content": "11 miles from the strip, close to the mountains.you will find tone of he best that Vegas has to offer. Actually it is not in Vegas, it is in Summerlin. The accomodations and the service are impeccable. You start your trip by being picked up at the airport by a complimentary shuttle. Once at the hotel, check in is always speedy. Your room is beautiful and has a greatr view of the surrounding mountains. In the warmer weather DO NOT MISS THE POOL. The chaise lounges are in the shallow water of the pool. There are also circular beds for soaking in the sun or just relaxing.with a drink from one of the many waiters. Sometimes their are shows held at the pool area,,. sometimes there are weddings or private functions and the pool area may be closed for a few hours in the evening. The food choices are immense. Everything from a food court,to a steak house called the \"Chop House\". They have a wonderful buffet very reasonable priced, except the champaagne brunch on the wwekend. But it is still worth it with all the variety of foods available. The casino has a wonderful variety of all the latest slots. If you are not a slot player, You will find one of the best sport books in all of Vegas. There is also a Bingo hall.. The table games range from $5 to ???. It is not difficult most of the times to find a $5-$10 table. If you would like a complete break from gambling (or if you travel with children) there is a movie theater and an arcade to keep you occupied. The One BIGGEST DRAWBACK I have found IS.....If your room is not comped, they have a $24.99 a day surcharge added to the daily room rate. You will find many offers, including free play and free rooms and buffets if you are a player at the casino. Lastly, if you are staying on the strip and would like to check out the \"Red Rock\", there is a free shuttle that departs from the Fashion Show Mall. Wait on the north side you will see a couple differnt shuttles departing from there. check it out first, play a little and maybe next time you go out to Vegas, you might decide to stay", "Date": "February 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Las Vegas, Nevada", "Title": "\u201cBest Graduation Hotel to stay in\u201d", "Author": "tiara b", "ReviewID": "UR125048697", "Content": "I had this best graduation weekend getaway with my friends staying in this hotel.

I was there for four days and the service was definitely five star along with the rooms. The rooms are still good but the service has gone south. If I owned this hotel, I would definitely figure out what management changes have been made in the past four years and change them back. It's gone from staff being proud and passionate to just doing their job. Four years ago when you said \"thank you\" the response from every employee was \"our pleasure\". I've recommended this property to so many people...but not any more. From check in, to bar service, to restaurant bar service it was like they all wished they were somewhere else (and so did I). My fiance and I escorted some friends to there car and sat down in the lobby. I had may arm around her, and gave her a few kisses, when Andrew the security guy comes up and tells us to \"take it to our room\". I called for his manager and she supported him. They said our behavior was \"inappropriate\" where I invited them to visit some of the other public areas of the casino to witness some really \"inappropriate\" behavior. I'm always amazed when properties like this will sell you as many drinks as you can consume at $12 a pop and then they want to hold you to account on your behavior. The next morning on our way out we go to the Starbucks and ask for soy milk to add to our coffee. My fiance is told it will cost $.75 extra. We inform them that Starbucks never charges us...ever! In a snippy voice the Starbucks employee informs us that this Starbucks is owned by the casino and they make their own rules (say no more). While I'm getting the car, my fiance overhears a customer complain that his latte is cold. The same employee roles her eyes at him and in a snarly voice says, \"fine, do I have to make you another one?\" I'd be concerned if I was Starbucks. The rooms are great and the pool area and spa are a sensation, but I'll never be able to get my fiance back to this property as she felt she was treated like a second class citizen. If you can get a 2 star rate, it's worth a visit, but I can guarantee they will lose their five star rating if there isn't a huge change in management. My suggestion to the owners of Red Rock (in case they excuse themselves by thinking that they can't get good help in Las Vegas) is to go stay at the Mandarin Oriental for a couple of nights and observe how a five star hotel is properly run...it will bring back memories for you on how the Red Rock use to be.", "Date": "February 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "lagrange park, il", "Title": "\u201cThey have it all, skip the strip n hit their spa, oh the spa, the spa, ahhhh...\u201d", "Author": "jstark", "ReviewID": "UR125007276", "Content": "Ok, 4 outta of 5 star because their computers kept forgetting my room rate special I booked on their website n spa discount they emailed to me.

I've never stayed at this hotel before and have only been at the casino to check out restaurants or go for happy hour.

I was cursing whoever designed this elevator/room layout as I was making the long trek to the room. Ah, the room. It was definitely spacious. So spacious that it appeared all the furniture was pushed towards the window, leaving a dance-floor-sized empty space between the bed and bathroom. If this was their handicap-accessible room, they have succeeded in the fact that you could park a dozen wheelchairs in this space. I assessed the room and decided it was not worth paying an extra $50 per night. It was essentially the regular king-size room furniture thrown into a large space. I was now highly annoyed when I called the front desk and the same lady answered. She was nice enough to move us back to the 2-queen bedroom. But before that, she actually offered to lower the luxury king price from $50 extra/night to $35. Seriously? She was trying to haggle with me? This made me realize that she could've probably given us the crappy king-size room at no extra charge in the first place. So chintzy.

For a hotel of this size to have so few lifts (and for the three days I was there, 33% of those lifts were locked on a a single floor and never moved), and for the lifts to be so haphazard in how they function, is bewildering. The lifts would often take up to five minutes to show up at your floor and then, despite suggesting they'd go in the direction you wanted them too, they go where they chose, stopping at every floor regardless of whether the buttons were pressed of not. This is annoying enough when you're not in a rush - when you have a meeting to attend and it takes ten minutes just to get in and out of the lifts, it's incredibly frustrating.

We wanted to unwind with some personal time here. The location of Red Rocks is off strip. It takes approx. 20 minutes to get to the strip area. The good: 1. Trendy. It is a modern, trendy hotel all the way through. 2. Resort. Movie theater, bowling, casino, restaurants, pool/spa. There is something to do here for you. We went to a movie, hit the casino and had some great food. Great restaurants inside with good selections. 3. Location. Great off-strip location. Close to great hiking in Red Rocks Canyon if you want some outdoor activities to do. 4. Friendly dealers. Dealers and staff seem to like their job and were friendly/chatty. They weren't stuck up like many other casinos on the strip. Lots of locals playing here, got a lot of Vegas knowledge while sitting with them. Interesting. 5. Pool is open in January. A lot of hotels shut down their pools in the winter. The pools were open, but unheated. The spas were on and heated. Nice pool area with lots of pools available. We visited in the winter, so we underutilized it. Would be great in warmer months. 6. Trendy room, large tv, good water pressure and warm water. 7. Easy parking, not a long walk. A bonus in Vegas for those with tired legs from the Strip. 8. Close to other restaurants in the vicinity. 9. Casino games easy access. No waiting on a busy night to get a table. 10. Conference area. Large venue for conferences. I would go there or host a conference here. The bad: 1. No coffee maker in the room. For having a $20+ resort tax, there should be free coffee and a coffee maker in the room. There is a Starbucks downstairs to save the day, but not if you have an early flight, it wasn't open yet, doh! 2. For having a $20+ resort tax, there should be free water. Even Trump Tower had two free waters a day. You had to purchase it in-room if you wanted it from the pressure sensitive device. 3. Long walk down a long hall to get to the room. Needed a Segway or bicycle to get to the room. 4. Doors were loud shutting. Second hotel in a row with loud, heavy doors. 5. Room cost. Nice resort, but a little spendy/overpriced compared to other strip locations with similar ratings, especially with the resort tax. 6. Winter pool hours. Open from 10 am-4pm. Would like to use the warm spa at night. 7. Spa/hot tub was heated, but on the cooler side. Could have been heated up another 5-10 degrees. One of the spas/hot tub's jets were not working at all. 8. Parking garage music is inordinately loud. Is there a reason for blaring music? 9. Boarding passes. For having a $20+ resort tax, printing a boarding pass should be included. They cost $5 to print in the business center. Others may find it kid friendly, but you have to bring kids through the smoky casino to reach kid friendly activities...Leave the kids at home whilst in Vegas.

Let me describe why we choose Red Rock the first time, and why we elected to return. In a word, it offers the perfect combination of kid-friendly activities, excellent restaurants, and extensive gaming. We don't really have the ability to go to Vegas without our son, and so I had been searching for a hotel that would have something to offer to all of us. Some friends recommended Red Rock, and we promptly booked a Signature Suite. The advantage of this room is that it allows our son to have his own room (rollaway provided without charge) and bathroom, while offering similar levels of privacy for parents. On this return trip, I wasn't seeing any availability for each of our four nights, so I took a chance and called one of the Hotel's Casino Hosts. While we are certainly not big gamblers, he was able to find a Signature Suite at a price that easily bested what the Hotel offered on-line. On the first day, we rented a car from Enterprise (which happened to have a rental car on property). We explored Red Rock Canyon (incredibly beautiful, and a short drive away), then did some horseback riding at Bonnie Springs Ranch (again, very close by, and fun for kids). This was our pattern most days, spending time with our son during the day (and with a bowling alley, a multi-screen movie theater, and an arcade, there is certainly enough to keep parents and kids well entertained!) and reserving the evening hours for us. During the evenings, our son would go to the Kids Quest (on property) while we enjoyed dinner and gaming. A couple of things to note about Kids Quest: your child(ren) cannot stay more than five hours per day and they ask you to bring your child's shot records. We found the Kids Quest to be very competently run, and was much beloved by our son. We ate at Hachi (twice), T-Bones (steak) and Terra (Italian). Our favorite (just barely) is Hachi, which we feel is one of the top sushi restaurants we've ever experienced. At Terra, we opted to eat at the bar and limited ourselves to appetizers, which were uniformly excellent. Our last night was at T-Bones, which we loved. My wife's Filet Mignon and my lamb were both prime cuts and wonderful. I would like to report that we were successful at the table games, but that was certainly not the case. It was a total washout. Even so, we would return to Red Rocks in a heartbeat!", "Date": "January 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cOverall very well done\u201d", "Author": "letucker", "ReviewID": "UR123319692", "Content": "pool area was wonderful, spa was fantastic.

Its smells great and I'd drive back to Vegas again for it. :) I went solo this particular trip to have some 'me' time. It was quite enough to just plop down on that super comfy bed and play on my laptop. I had a great view of the strip in the distance and a nicely quiet room. My trip wasn't about the fast paced Vegas, but to get away and relax. Check out the online room specials for great pricing.

This trip I decided to avoid the strip and stay above the clamor of drunken crowds by staying at the Red Rock. What a pleasant change this decision turned out to be. Here is what sets Red Rock apart from the others I have stayed at on the strip: 1) The air quality was excellent. Somehow the cigarette smoke is dealt with in a very effective manner. 2) Very easy parking and access to the hotel rooms. By following the remarks other before me made, I parked in the garage close to the hotel elevators. This made rolling our suitcases from the car to the room a snap. 3) The variety of places to eat was nice. In addition, we were close to so many other dining options in the immediate area. 4) The 16 screen cinema was a fun alternative to gaming. 5) The bowling alley was the largest I have seen, and very busy. Maybe next time I will play. 6) Having two Starbucks location makes the morning treat oh so easy. 7) The hotel hallways have deep separate hallways for two room doors. This makes for much less hallway noise making it into the rooms. 8) The privacy and make-up room lights make coordinating with housekeeping easy. 9) The housekeeping staff was always so pleasant, and friendly. Never before have I been greeted so warmly by every housekeeping staff member. 10) Everyone who worked at the resort was friendly. I left thinking that everyone really enjoyed working there, and was glad to see me there. 11) The workout facility, inside the spa area, offered everything we wanted, including little bottles of water. 12) The buffet was good, but crowded so much of the time. I would take advantage of the Boarding Pass breakfast price and get there a bit before they opened to avoid the long lines. I will definitely return to the Red Rock. My experience there convinced me that staying off the strip was a good decision. Tip: You must have a room key to use the hotel elevators. The hotel lobby is one floor below the hotel garage. By the Starbucks there is a separate hallway with the convention center and hotel lobby elevator. Use this elevator if you have luggage and need to check-in. We checked-in before getting our luggage to avoid the issue. Early check-in begins at 11 AM. Before that you will pay a $25 fee. The $27+ daily total resort fee was worth it to us because we used the wifi and workout facility. This fee seems to be hidden in the fine print somewhere, but we expected it all the same.", "Date": "January 10, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Springfield, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful Property - Reserve Online\u201d", "Author": "welapa2010", "ReviewID": "UR122871778", "Content": "We stayed here for 3 days.

The Hotel is clean and quiet besides the smoking that goes on in the casino. However, every casino allows smoking so you cant get away from that. The bed was very comfortable and the shower pressure was nice. We ended up getting a view of the mountain side, which isn't bad. I think the city view picture on the website is a little deceptive since it's no where near that close to it. One downside is that they don't have a restaurant or a look out point on the high floors to check out the city. There are plenty of places to eat. Some are on the high end. But right across the street are Olive Garden, BJ's and some other places to eat if you dont want to stay in the hotel. A couple of intersections down the road is PF Changs and a few other restaurants. Plenty to choose from. We couldn't get into the pool because it was freezing cold, that is the water and not outside. The Gambling isn't too bad either. We enjoyed playing roulette at this place. Best to park on the East Parking Lot as it is much closer to the rooms. Red Rock Canyon is just 7 miles from the hotel. Very nice to visit. However, I would park the car at the entrance and walk in if you can. Not worth the drive all the way around the place. The best part is at the beginning of the drive. Shows: Do NOT go see Cris Angel. It's a waste of money. We felt ripped off. I would definitely stay here at this hotel again if I ever wanted to be away from the strip.

As others have noted, the rooms and actually the entire place is sparkling clean. Our room was spot on. Large than normal room and large bathroom. We did like that with the curtains drawn, you could sleep all day in total darkness. This is important for a new years eve night and sleep in day. We ate at the buffet and it was reasonably priced for dinner (23 ea), which is better than a lot of the resorts on the strip. Brunch on New Years was $16 each. A lot to choose from.

We were not met by anyone at the door and had to haul our bags in ourselves without benefit of a cart. The front desk clerk was extremely pleasant but did not bother to tell us there that the room we booked was not the room we would be getting. After a walk to the end of an extremely long corridor we opened the door to find one queen bed for my husband, myself and our adult daughter. When we called the front desk they admitted that they did not have any rooms with 2 beds but they would send up a rollaway free of charge. We left to get some dinner and go bowling and when we returned 2.5 hours later there was no rollaway. More calls placed to the front desk (of course we could not locate the person who originally promised the rollaway) and we are getting very cranky as it is 12:30 in the morning at this point and we had been traveling all day. They finally tell us that there are no rollaways left. My husband went ballistic and said that he was coming downstairs to talk to the manager. They urged him to wait to see what else they could do. Five minutes later an employee shows up with a rollaway. No apology or offer to help set up--just \"here's your bed\"--even though it is 1am. We don't think this room had been used in awhile. The only drinking glass in the room was 1 martini glass. Also the furniture was very dusty. When I woke up in the morning there was a lighted space between the curtains and the dust in the air looked like little snowflakes. The 4 upholstered chairs also had stains. Upon checkout I took issue with them charging us the resort fee--we had already paid 1/3 of the room rate in fees and taxes. They would not budge (but did offer to give us a breakfast coupon but it was 11am and we had already eaten).

As I was traveling with family, it was nice to be away from the hustle and bustle of the busier places downtown. It seemed to draw a 35-45yr old crowd along with tons of neighbourhood locals, so no risk of a frat party rolling past your door at this place. I tried both the burger place and the Mexican restaurant and the food was great and also really cheap for Vegas. Think 2 dinners for 30 bucks. Loads of other restaurants as well. I had a car so the 20 minute drive to the strip was never an issue. I imagine taxis would be pricey if you were looking to go out nightly, and didn't have a DD, so something to take into consideration. If you've done the strip once or twice before and have already had that experience, then this will be a nice change of pace. If it's your first time, you'd probably regret not staying closer to town. If you have a week, maybe rent a car for half the time and try both. Also, make sure to sign up for the Station Casino Players Card. You get anywhere from $3-$100 of free play at the slots and if that doesn't interest you, cash out and put the money in your pocket. Resort fee includes wifi if you end up selecting this option and the valet was great / friendly. If self-parking (there are two main lots), follow the signs for the spa. This will take you to the hotel entrance along with the self-park / valet. They are beside each other. Go up the ramp, and park on the first deck with the casino entrance. Leave your bags in the car, go through the doors and down the stairs to check in. The elevators won't work without the room card, so taking your bags down a windy staircase could prove tricky!

This time we enticed another couple to join us. Neither of us were disappointed. For our room, we were upgraded to a signature suite. It is the size of two rooms with a wet bar and min-fridge and a half-bath. There is a nice wrap around sofa - play pit and large t.v. in the living room. The bedroom is the same as the standard room - including the glorious bathroom. I would recommend one couple upgrading if traveling as a group - and the living room can serve as a great meeting area for cocktails before heading out. The standard rooms at the RR are just great. Again, this stay was enhanced by the great service of the hotel staff. This includes the front desk, car valets, bellmen, servers in the restaurants and dealers. I know I'm painting with a very large brush, but it's true. Why do we love the RR so much? The marble bathrooms are a great escape and spa on it's own. There's a t.v. over the two person tub and my wife has spent hours in that tub! There's a separate walk-in shower stall and the commode is in an alcove with a sliding door. The double sinks are well thought-out - with plenty of ledge space for personal items. How often do you find yourself cramped at the sink - when traveling? It will not happen at the RR. As it turns out we ate on property a fair amount: T-Bones and the Grand Cafe. In the past we have eaten in the mexican restaurant. The food is exceptional when compared to the strip in both quality and price. T-Bones is pushing the price/value line - but it was a great meal. So, here is why coming to the Red Rock can be a complete Vegas vacation: Getting to and out of the hotel is extremely convenient. There isn't the craziness or volume of the strip. Meaning - when you pull up at the end of your night (or morning) - there's no hassle or lines. The valet is ready to help you. The elevators to your room are short walk through the hotel lobby which is one floor below the casino/mezzanine. Another huge benefit of the RR - is just off-site, short walk or car ride are the local establishments of Summerlin - which is a happening suburb of Vegas. To the degree you want even more added value in terms of saving money on food, shopping etc - it is right outside your hotel. For Lifetime Fitness members, there is a club about a 1/4 mile away (or less). On this trip, we signed up for a hike/tour of the Red Rock National Conservation area (10 mins. away) through Red Rock Canyon Tours. I highly recommend this activity. There is also horseback riding and other outdoor activities as well. The hotel can arrange for golf or white water rafting and touring Hoover Dam is only 30 mins away. Other things to note about this property: There is live entertainment - AND NO COVER at Rock's Lounge. We saw a set by Zowie Bowie. A great local act. The bar in the middle of the casino area was also rock'n with a DJ and again no cover. I simply can't recommend the Red Rock enough.", "Date": "December 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Scottsdale, Arizona", "Title": "\u201cLove Red Rock\u201d", "Author": "RacCarp", "ReviewID": "UR121809054", "Content": "My husband and I stayed in late November right after Thankgsiving.

This is a first class operation. Our room was comped due to previous slot play on other visits. However, this is the first time we actually stayed here. We had a beautiful view of the mountains, with the pool right below us. We did not use the pool, but it was so beautiful. The amenities in the room were first rate-even better than Bellagio and the Venetian where I used to stay. Room comps are better here than most casinos depending on your put through (coins in). However, Station Casinos all have very little freeplay to offer compared to other casinos. Their freeplay is very similar to M Resorts, who is also a little tight on freeplay offerings for out of town visitors. We are all big slot players, and the machines seemed a little tough at first, but improved as the three day trip went along. In fact all six of us did ok the last two days once we found our way around and played smarter. The food choices and variety of restaurants are the best in the LV area. I love the buffet, which has great service and plenty of space between tables. We never had a long wait at the buffet, but get there early during the week because 4.99 attracts a bunch of locals. The food court offers great variety especially if you like Philly steak sandwiches. The cafe was super and had good quality offerings. Fish and Chips was great there. We did not go to the high end restaurants, but will upon return. After the hubbub of the strip it is very relaxing here. Atmosphere in the casino is great, and a great clientele also-a mix of area locals (Summerlin is the best) and hotel guests. Machines are spread out and there are non smoking sections also. One tip though: Get a room close to the elevator or else rent a Segway. Wow, beautiful rooms, but at 3 in the morning it is a trek to the middle or other end of the hallways. We love Red Rock and hope to be back as soon as the pool opens. It is a first rate place to stay and gamble. Good Spa too. My wife used it before but not this time. Anyone who complains about any aspect of this resort has their head somewhere besides their shoulders. From the valet to service in the casino and restaurants I would rate this as five stars.

To start with, the architecture and visual appeal of the casino are amazing, and just walking around and looking at everything is a treat in itself. In this respect, it puts most of the Strip casinos to shame. Everything looks very new and fresh. Our room had this same visual appeal and was very clean and comfortable. Although I didn't win any money, playing the tables was fun, and the dealers competent and engaging. Plenty of slots and tables regardless of what your favorite game is. The restaurant selection was probably one of my favorite things about this casino. We only ate at the buffet, which was good but not great, and Yardhouse. There seems to be a restaurant here to satisfy just about any palate and budget. Would love to eat at T-Bones steakhouse next time we're there. The only real downside of the casino is its distance from \"everything\" i.e. The Strip. I don't know if I'd recommend this place for a group of youngsters out to have a night on the town, but it's perfect for couples, or if you're looking for a more laid-back or quiet Vegas experience.

Rooms are plenty big for a couple as well as cozy and stylish. The beds are blissfully comfortable, the tub has room for two (thank you Red Rock!), there is a separate shower stall and double sink in the bathroom. There are great restaurants around the casino (Tbones is a favorite for drinks, appetizers, steak and great service at the bar, LBS has outstanding burgers, The Feast buffet is worth the price of admission AND there is even a mall-style food court as well), an awesome bowling alley, a Regal Cinemas movie theater (great popcorn) and a huge, fun Bingo hall. In summer, you would be well advised to hang in the pool area and the spa and gym should NOT be ignored. Yes, the daily resort fee ads up pretty quickly, though it is worth it at the end of the day if you use the internet and well equipped gym.

I love Vegas and usually visit a few times a year. However, I have always been reluctant to take the whole family. My kids are older now (11 and 16) so I figured they would be mature enough to understand the Vegas concept. Plus, we are staying way off the strip in Summerlin at Red Rock which I figured would be away from the big crowds. I was right, Summerlin is a very nice suburb of Vegas close to the mountains. I have stayed at other \"Station\" properties like Green Valley Ranch and have been pleased so I figured Red Rock was worth a look. Boy, was I right. What a great hotel. Red Rock is a large complex with hotel, spa and casino. It aso has bowling alley, a movie theate and kids arcade. The pool area is large and beautiful but was too cool for swimming. There are multple bars, reastuarants and a fast food court. The decor is contemporary with lots of crystal chandelieres. The rooms are clean, modern and spacious. We had a small issue with a toilet valve that we had maintennance fix the first day (service was prompt). One odd feature, was the bathroom door made of an opaque glass that did not block the light from inside. So if someone goes to the restroom at night, the light wakes you up even with the door closed. The rooms were always clean and any service needs were quickly addressed. Our walk to the room seemed very long because of the configuration of the hotel. So if this bothers you, request a room close to the elevators. You could stay at the Red Rock Hotel the whole time and be totally content. The Red Rock Canyon area is about 10 minutes away and it offers some great views and hiking trails. We wanted to do this but ran out of time. We did to see a few shows on the Strip which is about a 20 minute drive depending on traffic. We rented a vehicle, but there is a free hotel shuttle to/from the Strip. I play poker, video poker and pai-gow poker adn teh teh ccasino was very nice and not too smoky. The poker room was spacious and busy. My kids had a gerat time in the arcade and the movie theater.

The rooms are plush and a perfect size for a couple to enjoy.The decor is a bit dark and the lightning takes quite some time to diagnose so you can adjust it to your requirements.The Bose Wave Radio is a really nice touch! We found the bed to be semi-soft but still quite comfy, and we slept quite well on it.Everything in the room worked fine and the deep soaker tub filled very rapidly, and having the TV in the bathroom was very handy. It is a long hallway if your room is located more than halfway down because the elevators (which are the fastest we have ever experienced) are located at one end and the building is long and shaped like a bow..For us it didn't matter at all and I even asked for a room farther down the hall. We ate at the buffet which is quite good and the Grand Cafe which had some crabby employees, one which gave us less than half full glass's of orange juice and charged us for them! We were not impressed with some of the people working in that restaurant at all. That said most of the interactions with employees were fine and when passing them in the hallways they acknowledged us with a hello. The spa amenities are great and after a workout in the nice exercise room I went and soaked in the large hot tubs and steam room.They also have a nice lap-pool just outside the exercise room which was very warm..The spa amenities are gender separated, the men have there caves that you walk to down a long corridor and the ladies are located in another area not far from the reception desk. It wasn't busy at all when we stayed there and almost felt like we had the entire 18th floor to ourselves..Never heard any noise at all except for the odd slam of the heavy entrance doors to a suite near ours. The location of the resort shouldn't be a issue since if you do your homework then you will discover that it is located about 10 miles west of the strip.If you rent a car it is a easy drive straight up West Charleston Blvd to the strip..If you like, you can use the hotel shuttle which will drop you at the Fashion Show Mall. We only went to the strip once to see a show and we parked in one of the many free parkades at the Fashion Show Mall. Their is shopping directly across the street from Red Rock (Costco,Best Buy) and back up #215 towards the airport there is another large shopping area with JC Penny etc about 2.5 miles. Another issue that we didn't care for at Red Rock is they charge a substantial $27.00 daily resort fee and then when we went to the 5th floor to use the business centre computer they charge a fee based on a dollar per minute to use a computer! That's Buffoonery Indeed...A quick log on to print boarding pass's is a flat fee of $5.21! All in all we enjoyed our stay at Red Rock and we definitely would go back and stay again and next time it will be when those very nice looking pools and loungers are open and the weather is hot.We will just stay away from the Grand Cafe and not use their Business Centre.", "Date": "December 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rochester, New York", "Title": "\u201cHits, but mostly misses at Red Rock\u201d", "Author": "Maggie R", "ReviewID": "UR121267121", "Content": "We have been pretty loyal to Station Casinos, but that loyalty is waning. On the surface, this hotel looks beautiful and we were excited to stay and play there. But it was one frustrating detail after another, and while all of them we small, it started to add up. First, we (like others have commented) had a very difficult time finding the registration desk from parking garage. It was on a separate floor and not well marked. We schlepped around a bit with four pieces of luggage and we able to find registration and check in. Next: The room was visibly attractive and appeared to be well appointed. I had a bit of a headache and wanted to take something for it. As has already been noted, there was no water glasses in the room. I called the front desk to ask about that and she explained that \"for safety reasons\" they are not included in the room. Huh??? So I thought about it and thought that because of the glass and the marble floors in the bathroom, they might break and shatter - She had some sent up - and here is the ironic thing - they were plastic! Is plastic unsafe?? My last comment on this is - Okay, if you are not going to provide drinking glasses (or plastic cups) wouldn't a very nice little sign next to the ice bucket explaining that save a lot of frustration on the part of the guest and extra time wasted on the phone with the staff? The rest of the details left us thinking that whoever designed this place and called the shots was either a practical joker, a newly minted graduate of \"if everyone expects a zig, I'm gonna give them a zag\" school, or a self appointed expert on the difference between a hotel and a resort.. It was quite comical at times to witness the huge disconnect between what this \"resort\" wants to be, and what well traveled patrons need it to be. The room lighting was interesting... switched all over the place, different combinations of light. We had fun with that one. Only FOUR drawers!! Are you kidding me?? So in a RESORT, are we supposed to live out of out suitcases? That makes no sense to me, but that's what we were forced to do.. The TV remote was almost non-functional. When I called about that, I was told that they were having a hard time getting the new ones - they were on back order. Again, hard to believe that that detail was overlooked..When I went to see if I could turn off the TV manually, I ran my fingers along the top and was covered in dust. Ah-chew! The restaurants were okay - Dinner at T-Bones was excellent, as was the wait staff. We also ate at the Mexican restaurant and the Italian restaurant. Food was good, but wait staff was not very personable. Professional yes, but not at all warm or friendly. We went the buffet for breakfast. Staff was very nice - I ordered a cup of coffee and a glass of milk - the waitress was so sweet and apologetic - as she told us they were out of milk and cream for the coffee. Huh?? She was finally able to get some cream for the coffee, but no milk. I felt bad for her, having to tell that to her customers. The room we had was at the very end of the hallway - and it was a LONG hallway. No elevators in the middle, they were only on one end of the hotel. We made jokes about that too. Then the final problem - and it was a big one. My husband's casino host \"Joanie\" had promised him that, based on his play, she could comp the room and mostly all of our food. When we went to check out, nothing was comped. Absolutely nothing. It was 7 am and we had a flight to catch - she was not in until noon. He ended up using a majority of his points - points that elevated him to the Chairman's Club - points that he had acquired over the years as a loyal patron of the Station Casinos. They almost all gone now. He was able to speak to her, and while she was apologetic and thought it was all taken care of, there was nothing she could do to replace those points. She told him that he could've put it on a credit card and she could've reversed that charge, but that information was too late. The reason I took the time to write this is: a) for a place whose lifeblood is hospitality, I am shocked at the number of details this \"resort\" missed and b) I was the one who suggested we try the Red Rock and my husband obliged. I feel obligated to let others know that this place does not deliver on any of it's visible promise.

NO COVER charge either (first time I didn't have to pay to see them!) True, the drinks were un-Godly expensive in the club they played in - but where aren't they fortune in a venue like that? My wife and I danced til like 130am! Everyone there had so much fun. For a family - Red Rock has everything you could want and more...without the bank busting fees like some other resorts. They have a bowling alley, huge movie theatre, reasonable shops and lots of fun food places (so you don't have to waste $$ buying your kids food they wouldn't eat anyway.) Check out the resorts web page and you'll see why. The pool is pretty amazing too! While this resort/casino is off the strip - that is what makes it great! No traffic, no congestion, no throngs of people all around so you can't breathe. PLUS, up and down the road in both directions is plenty of great places to eat/shop as well. Seriously, google map it and check out the surroundings. There's even TONS of parks within a mile (literally) in the Summerlin residential area (the best one was \"Vistas Park\") that you can take kids to play basketball, baseball, playgrounds and/or just running around in grass fields. Don't expect all the glitz/glamour of Vegas (i.e. don't go here if your sole purpose is to gamble,) and you won't be disappointed. You can still dabble in the games but do so much more - at a much more reasonable rate!", "Date": "November 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Springdale, Utah", "Title": "\u201cI love the Red Rock.\u201d", "Author": "Margielee2000", "ReviewID": "UR120956137", "Content": "Great place to stay to enjoy a true resort experience with a fantastic casino.

TV use can be annoy I prefer when they keep it simple. The hotel is very far away from the Strip (25-30 mins because of the traffic) which is not so nice depending on what you are going to be up in Vegas. For me it was a pain because I went for an expo show and I had to come and go many times during the day and the traffic was heavy. The Kids Quest is SUPERB! my children loved it althought the ckeck-in takes FOR EVER! they can only stay up to 5 hrs and parents cannot leave the resort which was ok if you want to catch a movie or stay in the casino enjoy the pools or maybe just go to sleep but if you need to go somewhere else you cannot do that unless you pick up your kids. The Casino is lots of fun...I'm far away from beign a player but I did spend some time there and had a good time. The bar cocktails are HORRIBLE!!!! don't trhow your money away on cocktails! just get some wine or beer or whatever you want but not a cocktail!!!! There is also bowling lanes, cinema, arcade for the bigger ones, BINGO, food court (very good by the way) specially Ben & Jerry's!!! Food is super super good!!!! The buffet has lots of variety but the service is quite slow and not very nice.

The location is about 20 minutes off The Strip, which was perfect. Still a very easy drive into the lights and excitement.

One note, if you have a choice of room location, pick one that is close to the elevator! Holy cow, the hallways are so long! The room was very clean, nicely decorated, HUGE bath tub which I love. It's a bummer that they're not allowed to have coffeemakers in the room (front desk person said it was a health code thing, but I wonder if it's because there's a Starbucks on the 2nd floor). Housekeeping did a great job during our stay and I appreciated being able to pick and choose what they did each day. We had a view of the outdoor pools and they were gorgeous, but it was cold while we were there so they weren't open. Used the gym twice and it was also very clean and nicely set up. Nice to walk on the treadmill with a nice view of the courtyard landscaping and lap pool. Plus complimentary water! Ordered breakfast from room service one day and the portion was very generous--especially at room service prices. The conference rooms where the convention was were also excellent and the hotel provided great refreshments all day long. Our evening conference activities were at the bowling alley and the Rocks Lounge and both were set up nicely. I'm not a gambler, but the casino was pretty large and not too much smoke luckily. I could go on, the amenities were quite substantial including a ton of restaurants (fast food and sit down), bars, etc. The staff was always very cordial and pleasant. Oh, the concierge services were FANTASTIC. We worked with 3 different women and they were all great. They would text us info if we were away from the hotel, they rented us a car, recommend GREAT seats for the Human Nature show, they made our trip a hundred times better than if we had tried to plan things ourselves.

It's about a 25 minute drive from the rental car facility. We used the valet service and checked in at 11pm on a Wednesday night. The guy at the check in counter was very slow. He typed slow and it took longer than usual to check us in. He explained that the hotel was full and that the room type we requested was not available. We wanted a non-smoking king room. We got a non-smoking two queen room instead. He told us we could switch rooms the next day if one was available. He also told us that because our first two nights were comped, we would have to pay $15 if we wanted internet access and $10 for access to the spa. The thing that I didn't understand was that if the resort fee was comped for our first two nights, why wasn't the internet and spa included?! Our third night (a Friday night), we got a rate of $79 and had to pay the $27.99 resort fee plus taxes. That's when he said that the internet was complimentary because we had to pay the resort fee. I told him he shouldn't call it complimentary since we were paying for it in the resort fee. Anyway, we were pretty upset with this new policy. Why send us a promotion for a free room and then nickel and dime us with additional fees to use the internet and spa? Besides all of that drama at check-in, our room was nice and spacious. It was halfway down the long hall. Thank goodness it wasn't further. We've stayed here before and it can be a long walk if you get a room at the end of the hallway. The bathrooms are ultra modern and clean. The shower door handle was a little loose, but the dual sinks were nice and convenient for us when getting ready in the morning. We did check out of the original room and checked into a king non smoking room the next afternoon. That room was basically the same as the two queen bed room, except with just one bed. We did try the Feast Buffet for dinner on a Thursday night. We went around 4:30pm and there was a short line. The food was OK for the great and reasonable price. I think it was around $14 for dinner. We went again for breakfast on Friday morning. The line was also short on Friday. There are two lines at the buffet - one for the hotel guests and VIP and the other for the general public. For $5, the breakfast was well worth it and there was a decent selection. We did try going for breakfast on Saturday morning, but the lines were just ridiculously long! Even the line for their Grand Cafe was long. That was a bit frustrating and disappointing, but I guess the weekend is a lot busier. There is a decent food court, movie theater, huge bowling alley, arcade, and kidquest play area. We didn't go the pool this time. We did some gambling here and it didn't treat us very well. The machines weren't very loose. There is a wide selection of machines and many new machines we haven't seen before. We had fun. Just wished our money lasted longer! We knew this hotel was far from the strip, but we've stayed here before and like the rooms. We had a rental car and were fine driving to the strip and other Vegas locations. Since our room was free the first two nights and only $79 the last night we don't have much to complain about. We were just disappointed that they wanted to charge us for the internet and spa access on those free nights. I guess that's the new policy for comped nights.

I have defaulted in the past to those on The Strip simply for access. This last time I was in Vegas for a convention that was being held at Red Rock. It's about 20 minutes from the strip but my friends who have been there and reviews have all praised it so I was kind of looking forward to it. Frankly, while I still love to party, Vegas can wear at you and knowing I was going to be there for a week, it seemed perfectly reasonable to have a sanctuary from the craziness. As it turns out, I hit the strip the first night and never went back. Red Rock really has it all in one place. Unlike some of the Strip casinos which figure if they have a hotel, gaming area and some spa they can call themselves a \"Resort\", the Red Rock actually feels like one. The pool is magnificent. The array and quality of the restaurants is excellent. While the casino isn't the best I've seen, it's as good as the upper tier on the Strip. The standard hotel rooms put to shame anything in the same range on the Strip. 42\" flat screens in the bed room, a tv over the SOAKING tub, 2 person shower, modern yet tasteful furniture.... The rooms are simply stunning. And remember, these are the STANDARD rooms. Upgraded rooms are spectacular. The only room complaints were having to pay for internet service and a handle on the show which while it worked, would come off. Security is good and you never feel there are any concerns. Staff was a mixed bag. Everyone at the restaurants were very good. Front desk was also pretty impressive. Business Center, well, not as helpful and kind of snippy but we all have off days and I chalk it up to simply just her being off. She seemed nice just in a rotten mood and thus less than helpful. We ate at T-Bones (steakhouse), Italian, Yardhouse and \"cafe\" while there and all were very good. We tried all the bars and the Yardhouse became the goto-point during the stay. The Cafe was the best all-around option for breakfast and lunch. prices were good and food above average to excellent. We didn't have anything bad there. The Steakhouse was nice but VERY expensive and I still believe that Mon Ami Gabi at Paris is the best value in the city in that regard with better steaks than T-Bones. The Italian restaurant was a nice surprise. We were told by one of the staff to avoid the Mexican so we did.

I found this annoying. I had to be careful to not disturb their \"for sale\" items, and that left me uncomfortable. I couldn't use the fridge without disturbing their items and generating a sale, so I asked for another fridge. It was delivered for another charge -- $15 per night -- and had no freezer, just a chiller. The chiller smelled funky so I had to put it in the bathroom to avoid breathing the smell all night. Internet service is an extra $15 to $20 plus taxes per night. Not allowed to use the luggage cart; only bellman can do that, and of course a tip is expected.

In the grand scheme of things, my stay was perfect. Sure, there were a couple of hiccups, but nothing to blemish the experience. The room was great (19th floor on the \"rocks\" side). Plenty of space and the bathroom... I could have stayed just in the bathroom... was incredible. The tub was maybe 2 1/2 feet deep, great for soaking and the TV above the tub kept me from getting board. Separate big shower with great hot water and volume. All of it (including the double sinks) beautifully tiled in marble. Speaking of marble, the overall Architectural Finishes in the entire property are top-notch. In simple conversations with more than a few people, they all commented on the fantastic finishes. This is a beautiful, well maintained property. The wireless worked fine and was fast enough to use my VOIP to make calls home. Had two meals in the Grand Cafe and three in the LBS joint (I say \"joint\" with all the due respect and love a classic hamburger \"joint\" deserves)! The food at the Grand Cafe was spot on and the Plain Jane burger at LBS was exactly what a high quality burger should be (flavor oozing out of the thing and about two stages from still being on the hoof (as in RARE, just as ordered)). The crispy French Fry's were the perfect compliment to the perfect burger. So, for a hiccup? Service was a bit slow in the Grand Cafe. This is a Stations property and I've seen this \"bit slow\" service at other Stations properties. I'm not sure if it was on the wait staff side, or the cook side of the house, but it did take more time that I expected to order and receive my food than I would expect, given the number of people that were seated. The food was great, just the wait time was a bit long. I guess there was only the one hiccup. The conference was a \"go all out\" sort of thing, so didn't get to spend too much time in the Casino. The play I was able to work in was fun and while I didn't \"break the bank\", I didn't walk out broke either. :-) I really don't gamble though. I just spend money on being entertained in the only individual sport where the participants can still smoke and drink, besides maybe fishing. At least with slots, you don't have to clean anything when you get home. Maybe it's time for an Olympic Slot Tournament Team. The conference facilities were top-notch. There were almost 600 attendees at this conference and all the facilities were well lit, well laid out, comfortable (not to cold/not to warm) and in good condition. The projection screens were high enough that even those in the back had a good view. When it was time to split the conference room into three separate rooms, it was pulled off without a hitch and in about 20 minutes. If your organization ever needs a conference facility, tell the organizer to get on the phone with Red Rock quick :-) So, for the overall rating... On those goofy grading scales of from 1 to 10 (with 10 being the best), I'm hard pressed to ever give anything a 10.

We chose this property since we were coming to Las Vegas to see a concert that was taking place at the hotel. Under normal circumstances we would stay at the Wynn/Encore. However, this hotel definitely rivals either of those properties. It has a very upscale vibe from the moment you enter. The main lobby is understated, with an elegant lobby bar in the background, and soothing music being piped in. Our room faced the canyon. As such there was no reference to being in Las Vegas. It was a spectacular view, and quite a contrast from the flashing lights of the strip. The room was well appointed and comfortable, if a little bit small. The bathroom was also well stocked with high end amenities. The casino has a casual feel, with an incredibly friendly staff. This cuts both ways. It\u2019s very comfortable, but you may miss the glitz associated with the high end strip hotels. Pros: Off strip means quiet relaxed environment Large sunny pool area Restaurant options at all price levels Excellent attentive staff Plenty of kid/family entertainment available Cons: Pool closes at 4:00 on concert days. HORRIBLE decision Off strip means fewer entertainment options. No robes or coffee maker in room Consistently slow service at all restaurants visited (except the non casino owned \u2018Yard House\u201d) Overall I would recommend the Red Rock if you want a change of pace from the strip, or are looking for a quieter Las Vegas experience.

I'd give the Grand Cafe a miss; I ate there once, our meals were over priced and largely inedible, the wait staff were indifferent to our concerns about the meal and we had to ask for the bill several times.

I have recommended the Red Rock to everyone I know who visits Vegas. I loved the location and the fact that you can stay here and never have to leave. Amazing dining is available within the resort. Some of the best Sushi and Italian dining that I've had, not to mention a great burger joint! There is something for every taste and budget. One of my colleagues had her pre-teen daughter on the trip with us so we were able to go bowling with her, see a movie and play fun games.

I had a simple request for a meeting room for four people and in this giant hotel complex, I was told there was nowhere other than their lobby or one of their restaurants to hold a private meeting! No alternatives were offered and no creativity was displayed to try and meet my request. Certainly not what I would describe as AAA service. As for location - basically it is in the middle of nowhere. It's miles from the strip and including tips you will be up for nearly $70 for a trip via taxi. The shuttle service only goes once every couple of hours and the last shuttle at night is 10pm - hardly what you'd expect for a party town like Las Vegas!

The Red Rock is located just off of I-215 which affords you the ability to visit downtown or the strip in a matter of minutes, but, if you're like my wife and I, you'll spend the great bulk of your time at the resort itself. It not obnoxiously overbuilt like so many of the modern hotels and casinos in Las Vegas, so you don't end up wandering hallways for 45 minutes to get a cup of coffee from Starbucks to start your day. Your room view is not obstructed by some towering hotel next door, and you will not have to fight huge crowds or unbearable traffic every time you leave the grounds. The pool is incredibly well designed, and the spa is great.

What I found when reading reviews for Red Rock were mostly awesome!!! I will admit I was a little hesitant staying so far from the strip, but when we got there all hesitation was gone!! We arrived early on a Friday in Vegas to take our 5yr old daughter to see Lion King that weekend. To our surprise they let us in our room at 12:00 noon no extra fee or anything. Our room was facing the many pools they have at the resort. The room had 2 double beds with contemporary styled decor with gorgeous marble tiling and dbl sinks in the rest room with a Jacuzzi tub. Totally enough room for all of us. We proceed to the pool area and this is where it's mind blowing. There are about 6 different pools in one area (incl the Jacuzzi\u2019s) lil ones will have a ball for they can be easily used by mostly anyone swimmer or not. You can lay down poolside (in the water) and order food and drinks. The place is just beautiful!! Beware on Fri's they sometimes shut the pool area down early I think by 4p if there is a concert so get there early!! The casino itself is very massive. But the thing I really loved the most about the resort was their Kid Zone play area. You can leave your children in a wonderfully safe, caring and massive environment with food, fun, and entertainment for a very reasonable fee while you gamble your heart and money away. There is also a Multiplex movie theater and bowling center right on sight!!! This is one of the most family friendly spots I know of in Las Vegas. Now don't get me wrong we are not \"old\" parents, but I will say we are not in the 20 something bracket that feels the need to deal with the ungodly traffic, mounds of people, and the sometimes unusual entertainment that frequents the strip. We are the type of people who enjoy family esp. with our lil daughter and keeping her happy when we visit Sin City and NOT have to deal with Circus Circus (no offense). Lastly, I want to speak of the PRICE!!! Um...let\u2019s just say there is NO WAY you'll find these rates on a weekend on the strip (we paid $98 plus $25 resort fee- per day) chk-in Fri chk out Sun. Granted they have something like a $25 per day resort fee added to the room rate, BUT it still doesn't compare to the elegance, atmosphere, and entertainment you can get here for much less if you have little ones!!! Also, if you truly don't mind driving about 20-25 min to get to the strip then this place is REALLY for you. And if all the hub bub about the strip has become overrated, then this place is your spot hands down!!!

There were too many to eat at one meal so we boxed the leftovers. The guest room was clean, neat, spacious, and attractively decorated. It even had a door bell. There were plenty of pillows and bed linens were soft and comfy. The bathroom has both a soaking tub and separate shower plus plush white robes to wear to the spa facilities. For us there is more to Las Vegas than just gambling. We love the resort amenities included with the $24.99 resort fee. We liked the Red Rock exercise room, lap pool, sauna, steam room, cold dip pool, and jacuzzi. The changing facilities are private and very clean. Toiletries (e.g., shampoo, hair brushes, hair products, toothpaste) are so appreciated. We usually spent the morning enjoying the facilities. The casino's location, location, location was perfect. The drive to the strip was not bad. The casino is located very close to the Red Rock Canyon National Conservation Area. Hiking there is fantastic and suitable for all ability levels. Besides hiking there is, for example, rock climbing, mountain biking, and canyoneering. Take a camera for pictures of canyons, red rock cliffs, and even petroglyphs.

The resort itself is quite beautiful, rooms are well appointed and the beds very comfortable.... However, we experienced nothing but frustration when dealing with hotel staff. If you choose to stay at this hotel please be keep the following in mind: 1. The hotel is a good $55US cab ride into the strip. There is a complimentary shuttle but however it only runs every 2 hours (starting at approximately 11am & finishing at 10pm) and as there are only 12 seats, it fills up fast. If the bus is full also keep in mind that you will have to arrange your own cab as this is beyond the responsibilities of the valet / bell desk - They will not assist in any way. 2. Bed linen is not automatically changed - You will need to request for this to happen (often a few times before it actually happens). I had a hold in my sheet which is why I could tell it hadn\u2019t been changed in over 4 days! 3. If you require any assistance that is even remotely out of the ordinary, don\u2019t expect any help from hotel staff - They are clearly not interested and therefore not willing to help. 4.

The staff was wonderful. They couldn't do enough for you and they are well trained in their jobs. Very polite and knowledgeable. The hotel itself is in excellent condition. The only thing wrong I had was one of the light bulbs was burnt out in our room. We had an upgraded king room. The room is beautifully appointed and very functional. A little on the dark side for my taste, but still lovely. The bathroom is beautiful. But I did have a problem taking a bath. The tub looks very comfortable, but I kept slipping and couldn't lay back with my legs extended. They need to put some kind of a mat. My mother and aunt had the same room with two queens. My aunt kept saying that the bed was the best bed she ever slept on. And they were rather comfortable. We were able to enjoy the pool area one day. There was ample space by the pool and we were able to find a place in the shade. The drink service around the pool was excellent, but the food service was very slow. We actually stayed at this resort because it was the only place I could find in Las Vegas that was at least a 4 star resort that had bingo. My mother and aunt must have their bingo. Well they do have bingo, but my mother and aunt were very disappointed with it. And these too ladies know BINGO. They would do a $38 buy in, and they win $15. To quote my 90 year old mom \"The BINGO sucks here\". So we ended up taking them downtown where they like to play and were able to win a decent prize. On a $35 buy in at Union Plaza, she won a $420 prize. Much better result. I must mention the rest of the casino I found more than adequate and unless you want to see a show, there is no need to go to the strip or downtown. This hotel has all you need. Also it is close to neighborhoods so many stores are located close by. This was also a hotel I didn't mind using the mini bar. I found the prices reasonable. I RARELY use the mini bar. If the casino steps up their bingo we would come back again. But as it stands now, my mother wants to stay downtown at the Golden Nugget next year for her birthday.

To our surprise they had a room ready and it was exactly what we had booked: mountain view, king-size bed, 11th floor!!! What a great first impression!

We enjoyed the pleasant and appealing attitude of the Sandbar staff. We ate at the following restaurants, and loved the food and service at all of them: The Grand Cafe - breath-taking European-style decor, incredible value for the high-quality food. Special shout-out to our waiter Robert, who provided exceptional service! The Feast Buffet - so many sumptous choices for every palate and appetite! Our breakfast favorite: cheese-filled crepes w/ berry sauce! The Yard House - a beer lover's oasis! Great ahi and mahi-mahi creations, lunch or dinner. The 10pm specials came handy after a trip to the Grand Canyon! The Sandbar - impressive salad w/shrimp included 4 gigantic grilled jumbo shrimp on top! The quality and presentation of the food are world-class, and the wait staff made us feel valued and welcome!

We were given a room with a pool view and I believe the bedding in the rooms is the best of any place I have ever stayed. The bathroom is very large with a deep tub and seperate shower. There are also 2 sinks and the toilet is in a seperate closet off to the side. The room comes with a large flatscreen TV and plenty of dresser and closet space and a free safe inside the closet. I played 3-4 hours of blackjack every morning and lost about $200-$300 each time ($25/hand) but the dealers are very friendly and the local players are very nice also. The video poker pay schedules are some of the best in vegas and I was able to play at the bars each night and made a profit each time. Drink service was excellent. We ate the YardHouse brew pub one night and it was o.k. and had the buffet another night for dinner. This is a great deal, for $16 you get the dinner buffet with plenty of selections and very good tasting meats and desserts. Good Tip: There is a bagel shop right next to the sports book where you can get a toasted bagel for $1.50 if you are looking for a cheap breakfast and I saw some people eating sandwiches there and the sandwiches contained about 3 inches of meat. Since it was 110 degrees we spent a lot of time poolside. The servers come around often but drinks are expensive ($7 for a beer).

I would not discourage people from trying the RR but experienced travelers (like us) felt like there is likely something better in Vegas that offered much of the same qualities the RR offer but at a more attractive location to the entertainment options (palms, cosmopolitan, Wynn). The resort seriously needs some quality entertainment and night club vs the occasional concert that it currently offers.

If I had to choose things for them to improve on I would say there are not enough outlets in the room, especially for a modern hotel. I believe there were four in the bathroom and four in the bedroom. I would think something built so recently would have a charging station or something. Also, there are no vending machines and a soda is $5 for 12 oz from room service. I think you could get cheaper drinks downstairs, but late at night with a sleeping child I would have preferred a way to get something a little more reasonably priced.

Still a lovely pool view, though. There is only 1 robe per room so we requested another one. Also needed hypo-allergenic pillows and though it was 10:30 pm housekeeping was there in minutes. I love how there is a doorbell and electronic \"do not disturb\" and \"please make up room\" door signs. Staff was wonderful poolside, in the casino, restaurants, and everywhere else except for the buffet. It might've been because I was part of a large group that came in for dinner. We seemed to be an inconvenience to them. I also was not impressed with their buffet. I heard it was the best in Vegas, but it isn't. Stayed at the Rio last year and THEIR buffet is the best. If you plan on going outside the resort (visit the strip, shop the outlet malls) you'll need a car. There are shuttles to/from the strip and a shopping center (not outlets), but I didn't use them so I can't tell if they're convenient.

I spoke with the concierge about 4 weeks prior to our stay to make the arrangements. Unfortunately she did not really know the facts of the elements of package which negatively affected our stay. She suggested to schedule our massages after kayaking which sounded great. I was told we would be back from kayaking around 3pm, so she scheduled us for 6 pm massages which was the last appointment of the evening. Actually you return between 6-7pm, being off the strip the resort is the last drop off for the adventure company's shuttle service. I asked the concierge if there was any hiking involved or just kayaking and was told no hiking. There was hiking, which we were not prepared for with the proper gear/footwear. We were also told that lunch was not provided so we scrambled in the morning to figure out what to bring for lunch and lunch was provided. We were lucky and the rest of the guests were ok with us being dropped off first, we ran in the hotel, showered really quick and went to the spa getting there at about 5:45. Once arriving at the spa, we were repeatedly reminded that our appointment time was the last of the evening and that when we were done with our massages we were quickly get dressed and head out. We were called in for our massages at 6:10 and I was dressed and signed my receipt by 6:50- definitely not a one hour massage! I filled out a survey following the stay and received a letter from the concierge desk apologizing. It actually made me a little irritated because it felt like a pre-generated form letter and not very personal to my experience.

It is so easy to get to Red Rock from McCarren Airport. We hopped on the 215 beltway and were there in 20 minutes with no traffic. Not having to fight the strip traffic is a big plus. We took advantage of a Red Rock promotion that gave us 2 free nights and we paid casino rate for the 3rd. All resort fees were waived! We ate at the Italian restaraunt and it was very good. We both used the Spa and it was outstanding. The pool while great was a little cold... We both played Blackjack and Craps. I also played Video Poker. They have tons of machines. The Yard House addition is a real plus for serious beer lovers. While the wait staff does not serve from there...you can gat a beer to go and enjoy it while gambling. All and all a great stay.

The main pool, which was very cold by the way, includes a fountain and wading area. The other small pools, and there are at least 6, are slightly warmer!

I stayed 5 nights. When I first found out the resort was a ways off the strip, I was less than thrilled. However, I found the resort to be awesome. The rooms are designed so that the doors are in short hallways making that conversation outside your door in a hall a thing of the past. Loved that! The rooms are richly decorated with fabulous comfortable beds. The bathrooms have lots of marble, deep soaking tub and tv to watch while soaking! The bedroom has a large flatscreen tv and beautiful views of the hills. The conference rooms are great and the conference food was high quality. Red Rock does a fine job of conference service. The Red Rock Canyon is gorgeous and has a great 13-mile drive with fabulous photo opps. It is a federal park so a fee is charged to get in but it is reasonable. Take the drive, well worth the experience. If you are a hiker, perfect place for you at different level.s of skill. The trip to the strip proved to be shorter than imagined and after walking the strip, the Red Rock looked more fun. A great casino, big theatre complex and bowling alley. A Costco is across the street as well as a bookstore and other shopping. My only complaint is the service in the restaurants is not consistent. The buffet was excellent but the Mexican restaurant sevice was slow, 15 minuytes just to get a menu and even after two requests, no chips and salsa were served. The Lbs. burger place had excellent burgers but slow lunchtime service. At a conference, this can be a problem. I highly recommend this resort for couples or families.

You can basically touch anyone else that is in there when sitting down since the space is so cramped.

They also had some packages sitting on the floor, which required me to navigate around to find a chair. I assume this was an isolated occurrence.

I stayed in a suite and yes it is very large and comfortable with a bath and a half, separate bedroom, two closets in the bedroom, plus one in the entry hall. I did have two problems in the bedroom: I never got the safe to work and the TV's (huge flat screens) picture was very bad.

In the casino I fortunate to always sit at tables where no one was smoking, but when the casino was moderately busy the smoke in the casino does not get sucked out as well as you'd expect from the high ceilings. The smoke did bother me. There is a convenient strip mall across the street--no too bad a walk when it's not 100+ degrees. The pool area is very nice with a good, but expensive, food menu. OK, yeah lots of good looking servers. A recent bad trend in LV, in the last two years, has been the return of resort fees. The Red Rock I believe has the highest of the resorts--$25. You can make it work out if you use their shuttle from and to the airport. Also you get the usual--wi-fi, worked very good, a newspaper and boarding pass printing.

I received a comp offer for 2 free nights in a standard room, $75 in food, and a $150 free bet (also the resort fee was waived as a part of this offer). I had not been to Red Rock in a year and had never played very much ($100 at a craps table) so I was surprised to receive this out of nowhere. I was in room 14-124 which is a canyon view. This seems to mean pool view. The other view choice is strip view and I can only imagine that it offers a distant view of the strip (clever). The pool view is great and I could also see the new outdoor concert venue from my room. No concerts were going on but I think I would have had a great view and I imagine I could have heard the music pretty easily (that Saturday was Poison/Motley Crue). The room is really nice. Very modern in its d\u00e9cor. If it has a negative, it is that the room is very dark. The lighting is minimal and the colors are darker brown (think Aria Casino right after opening). Since I don\u2019t do a lot of reading or writing in my room (in fact, other than tv watching which provides its own light, all of my other hotel room activities involve having my eyes closed (most of the time)), the darker scene is ok by me. The bathroom is well lit (in here my activities are eyes fully opened \u2013 is this too much info for a trip report?) and has a separate tub (not jetted) with tv mounted on the wall at the end of the tub, a separate shower (not steam) which was a little small (or perhaps I am a little big), a separate toilet room with a pocket door separation with no lock (if that is a concern of yours), and dual vanities. All marble flooring, marble shower, and the toilet room had a faux leather wall treatment that was interesting in its uniqueness. The hotel was quiet with no noise from the neighbors (hey, Monte Carlo, are you reading this?) or the hallway. The elevators were quickly available and never crowded. Check-in was quick and polite. There were two people ahead of me when I got there but they were served quickly and I did not wait more than 10 minutes. I am not a foodie but I did enjoy the meals I had. I ate dinner and breakfast at the caf\u00e9 and one dinner at the buffet (which is only $12.99 for dinner with a stations casino card (only $4.99 for breakfast!)). The dinner buffet was your standard fare. Not a huge selection of Asian cuisine but plenty of old standbys including a pasta station where they had cooks preparing made-to-order pasta dishes. For dessert, they had hard ice cream and pies/cakes in a case which they sliced for you. A nice touch. The casino is where I planned to spend more of my time although I ended up not gambling as much as I would have preferred. The reason for this is that this was a work trip and I spent more time on work than I anticipated. Back to the Red Rock casino, I hit the tables in the 6am hour before heading out for meetings and had the craps pit to myself. The dealers were extremely friendly and knowledgeable and I did not encounter anyone who did not appear happy to be there. I also played a little blackjack and their rules were hit the soft 17, paid 3:2 on blackjack, and DAS. They also had several double-deck games with the same rules (I think they were $25 minimums). It was a fun, quick trip and I am already planning on returning if they can send me another offer like this one.", "Date": "June 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Santa Cruz, California", "Title": "\u201cLoved the upgrade!!!\u201d", "Author": "Gina124", "ReviewID": "UR114687153", "Content": "This is one of the premium hotels in Las Vegas.

First of all, our room was spacious. That's saying a lot for 5 of us in a room. They sent up a crib with all the Johnson and Johnson baby products, complimentary. The Wynn does the same. Second, the room was very quiet. You don't here hardly anything around you. It's so peaceful. Third, the buffet is EXCELLENT with an EXCELLENT $13 price tag! Very good quality food. The Wynn's buffet is Top Notch at a $50 pp price tag!!!! So we ate at the Rock's buffet, every meal! Yes, EVERY MEAL! And, my kids are very picky and they loved the food. Fourth, the pool is so comfortable and has easy access from the hotel. Unlike most Vegas hotels, you don't have to travel 8 minutes by foot, crossing through public areas to get to the pool. There are pool elevators in the hotel. It's excellent! The lounge chairs are heavy wooden chairs with the thick cushions. And, most come with umbrellas that you can crank up or down yourself. There are quite a few pools, so the pool doesn't feel crowded. Fifth, is the Kids Quest. Ok. I don't even hire babysitters! But this Kidsquest was by far the best! It's approximately 8.50 per kid per hour. You can pay extra and the kids will get lunch, dinner or whatever snacks you want for them. We asked my kids if they wanted to go to dinner with us or if they wanted to have dinner at kids quest. My 5 year old said, \"Mom, sometimes kids need a break from their parents. Us kids will eat here.\" That was priceless. Make sure if you use kids quest, you bring your childs shot records and a pair of socks so you don't have to buy them there. Buying socks there added $9 more to our bill for our 3 kids. So, have them with you. Sixth, is the location. Even though it is miles off the strip, it had all my favorite shopping within 1 mile, including my favorite coffee shop across the street, \"The Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf\"!!!! Driving in the area is easy as pie since it is off the strip. And, you can walk across the small parking lot, across the street to Best Buy, Marshalls, Costco, or my coffee shop. Nice short 3 minute walk from hotel. Other hotels on the strip, take 10 minutes to get out the door and onto the street. And, that doesn't include the walking time to shopping!

Although we've always chosen Vegas as the final destination to meet up with family and friends we have not seen over the years, I myself continuously find a certain need to venture away from all that glitz and blinking neon signs which Vegas is so well known for. Should it be your first or last trip to Vegas, you'll never regret taking the time out to visit the beautiful \"Red Rock Hotel Casino& Spa Resort,\" just a 15 minute drive up from downtown Fremont on Charleston Street, or just a 20 minute or so drive from the airport on the freeway! Haven't gone there yet? Waiting for you is one of the most gorgeous views of the Red Rock mountains if situated in one of their beautiful canyon view rooms. Full view windows from the top to the bottom that oversee the beautiful cabanas and pools with a backdrop of mountains that seem to take on a range of colors throughout the day. It is but a rare and overwhelming spiritual essence that seems to take hold of you as you gaze out to admire all that beauty within the confines of a very relaxing, spacious and wonderfully decorated room. Amenities such as thick lush white towels, beds & pillows selected purely for our comfort, a huge wall mounted flat screen tv, wi-fi if you need it, a white marbled floored bathroom and separate shower with a deep sunk in marble tub, and a private commode behind closed sliding doors makes this bathroom one to die for. You can entertain yourself in this bathroom hideaway by just clicking on the tv above while soaking in a tub of spa salts provided by the hotel. Before you know it, its time to leave this beautiful room and head on downstairs to one of the most beautifully floor planned Casino's I've been too. When you sit yourself down to play, it'll be in comfort on some cushy chairs, that I haven't found elsewhere in Vegas. There is no need to go elsewhere to play, everything is right here in this private get away, along with a variety of cuisine that is fit to please any palate out there, and at very reasonable prices too! Thank you Red Rock for always making it a pleasure for our entire family to visit you at least two to three times a year from Hawaii and elsewhere in the United States.

We stayed for two nights in late May, and were assigned a double queen room on the 17th floor (17-123) that was not too bad of a walk from the elevator with a view of the strip. Housekeeping kept the room neat and tidy, and even showed up after we crawled out of (the very comfortable) bed at 5:00pm our first day. The bedding was extremely comfortable, as was the shower (with excellent water pressure), the tub (which even fit a travel companion at 6'2\" and 300 pounds with ease). A few concerns were that there was a light bulb burned out in the toilet (maintenance took care of), the protective layer on the marble sink is peeling up right by the tub (which just either will make you want to pick at it or ignore it), and we were unable to use the checkout or view our bill via the TV. The free (included) internet was fast enough for our needs, and logging in while in your room gave us free access throughout the resort. Times we did not renew our internet gave us an \"opportunity\" to purchase internet throughout the resort at $9.99. Ouch! The resort has enough to offer that you really never have to leave. Which is good in a way, but it can also make for you being a captive audience. We took it as an opportunity to try some of the dining establishments throughout the resort, as follows: Buffet - Standard LV buffet. Reasonable costs, certainly, good food. Grand Cafe - Highlight of our trip. Great service, excellent food, and according to a traveling companion, \"delicious bloody marys!\" T-Bones Chophouse - left much to be desired. Too much \"attitude\" and a server/bartender that had too much attitude to be bothered with punching the right button, leaving us with fish tacos instead of fried oreos and a vicious eyeroll when we said something. The men's spa facilities must be tried, especially since it's included in the resort costs. A hot tub, cold plunge tub, sauna, and steam will take any jet lag right out of you. Enjoy a nice relaxing time with plenty of bottled water to help replenish and rehydrate you! We'll definitely go back - mostly because the service (with the exception of the bartender at T-Bones) was friendly and inviting.

I wanted him to experience Las Vegas but not the strip everynight so I chose the Red Rock Resort based on reviews on this website and a visit to their website. The resort is about 20 minutes from the strip so I rented a car so we could get around. I am pretty sure that the resort offers a shuttle but we never used it. Our room was immaculate and comfortable. Our beds felt like heaven! The bathroom was gorgeous and large. The bathroom had a TV in it which was great as my son often slept in and I could get ready and watch the Royal Wedding at the same time. Everyone at the resort was friendly and accommodating. The restaurants were bountiful. They offered an amazing array of cuisine and price points. My favorite place was The Cafe - great food and service and a beautiful atmosphere. The Red Rock bowling lanes were impressive and we had a great time bowling. The movie theatre was beautiful and clean. There was so many lounges to choose from around the pool I had trouble deciding where to sit! The water in the pool was too cold - I am not sure if it is ever heated - we are from the Northeast and unfortunately are used to pools being heated. Sat out in the sunshine nevertheless and enjoyed lunch outside. The concierge was extremely helpful. My son and I took Pink Jeep Tours to the Grand Canyon and to the Hoover Dam. Be sure to ask for a guide name \"Chris\" - he was a true gentleman and a wonderful guide. Went to the strip several nights - saw \"O\" and \"Las Vegas, the Show!\". We had a great time!

This was a vacation for me, but my husband attended the conference. We upgraded to one of the suites, which was very spacious and nicely decorated. The room had a living area with it's own bathroom, a breakfast table, wet bar, bedroom and large bath. The room overall was clean, though the shower could've been cleaner (there was mold around the door). Some repairs were needed as well. The toilet paper holder was falling off of the wall, the t.v. in the bathroom could not be adjusted because the mount was loose, & the shower drained so slowly the water would completely cover your feet. When we turned the jets on in our tub, black mold flooded the bath! My husband complained that his side of the bed was sagging & made it difficult to sleep; mine was o.k. We also heard construction every morning as SOON as the sun came up - (like by 6:30!) very annoying! We were on the 7th floor. The rooms are away from the casino, so you do not have to walk through to access your room or get to the pool. The pool is nice with plenty of lounge chairs. The music at the pool was very loud and mostly awful. I could not even listen to my ipod and drown it out! The service at the pool was extremely slow - 15 to 20 minutes to get a drink. There were lots of servers with few people at the pool, but we still couldn't manage to get anything quickly. This was a problem throughout our stay. Everyone was friendly however. The food served at the conference was mediocre, not as good as I would have expected. We did have the chicken nachos at Yard House, which were awesome! We also ate at the pool grill for lunch, which was pretty good. We ate at \"feast buffet\" for breakfast one morning and would not recommend it. (much like Shoney's) We did go to the bowling alley which is enormous! Lots of fun as well. There is also a theater on site and several shops. If you want to get to the strip, it is a $50 cab ride. The hotel does have a shuttle that goes to the Fashion Mall, but that's it.

The price of a 50ml bottle of Jack Daniels from the room fridge equates to $179.75 for 750ml bottle that can be bought from the local stores for under $20. A bit high even for Las Vegas. Add to this the cost and/or inconvience of getting morning coffee. Even Motel 6 has an in-room coffie pot and/or complimentry coffee in the lobby.. We originally booked a room with a \"canyon view\"; but we were placed in a room without \"canyon view\" Even though this fact was brought to the desk's attention March 23, we were billed for the \"canyon view\", We were billed for the \"canyon view\" again on March 25. If you knew I took a bottle of Jack out of the fridg for 45 seconds, why didn't you know that room #4125 does not have a \"canyon view\"? Why was the \"canyon view\" charged on the second nights bill?

You can get the best deal by exploring and drilling down into the hotel website. Perhaps the best strategy is booking the cheapest rate you can find on the website, then asking for a free upgrade to a canyon view when you check in. 2. The buffet is very cheap and a terrific value, though we only used it for breakfast. Everything in the food court is awful and overpriced. 3. The best entertainment in Las Vegas is Red Rock Canyon 5 miles west and the 13 mile loop drive there, with spectacular views and short easy hikes available.

I guess since I've stayed on the strip so many times, I felt like there wasn't enough to do at Red Rock. Yes, you could pay to see a movie or bowl, but is that really why anyone goes to Vegas? And so much for the \"locals friendly\" slots - I won more when we left after two nights and stayed on the strip. The buffet food was good and surprisingly cheap. Fortunately hotel guests can bypass the long lines - and they are lengthy. My biggest complaint was a little bit of false advertising. The printout of my confirmation clearly stated that the resort fee was $24.99 per night, but my bill listed it as $27.99. When I questioned this I was told that the fee was taxed. Okay, fine - but put that in the confirmation also. List it as $24.99 plus tax, or lump it into the total fee and THEN tax it. I just found it misleading. I also didn't get any love from the front desk when I questioned it. Would it have killed them to remove the $6? I'm really not a nickle and dimer, but it was the principle.

I know most everyone says that , but in our case, its actually true. We left with more winnings than losings from the casino - Room was large - Newspaper to the room in the morning was nice Minuses: - the hot tub wasn't hot - the casino smelled a bit smoky. The room smelled a little smoky too, we even called the front desk to make sure we weren't on a smoking floor - the bathtub looked great but wasn't comfortable. The chairs in the bar weren't very comfortable either - the music in the elevators was really loud. Its one thing at 8 PM but at 6 AM, its a little much - the service at the pool was really great. Of course, not many people out there since it is March. But the service was very attentive. More open hours would have been nice. When we left, I thought that on our next visit, I'd choose to go back to the Bellagio. My husband thinks we'll be back at Red Rock...It will probably depend on what type of trip we want. If we want the whole strip thing, we'll be back at the Bellagio. If we want to be more low-key, we will definately be back at Red Rock (plus, if its not July or August, its proximity to Red Rock Canyon for some hiking is a definate plus)", "Date": "March 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "CT", "Title": "\u201cSuggestions for Creature Comforts\u201d", "Author": "VayKay54", "ReviewID": "UR99395190", "Content": "Overall this i s a great hotel experience.

Also, I was there to attend a conference, with many materials to distribute and to discard. I notices throughout the hotel conference rooms, trash cans were scarce. Where you have people, you'll have trash. Please make it more convient in the conference rooms and corridors to throw away trash. Lastly, we held breakfast every day for two days. The coffee was inside the dining room, while the rest of the food was outside. It left many of us wondering where the coffee was. Please make coffee easier to locate at conferences.

Arriving to the RR Casino is like stepping into a desert oasis (no pun intended). Once inside you could be at the hippest hotel in L.A, NYC or Miami but without the attitude. In fact, the entire staff could not be more helpful - from housekeeping to the restaurants to the dealers. The rooms are spectacular and in an urban setting anywhere in the country, you will pay a great deal more for the same amenities at the RR. My other point will be to address the food. We we very impressed with both quality and price. In terms of negatives - some of the other reviews here on tripadvisor - are correct - the elevators are on one side of the building and all of the rooms are accessible via the extremely long hallway. Our room was towards the end on one of the floors and it WAS a five minute walk to the elevator. We weren't bothered by it...and I had run a half marathon during the trip. If you need a room close to the elevator ask. BTW: our room was quiet so think about what you are looking for the most (saving steps or a quiet room with limited floor traffic outside your door) The only other negative post on which we concur is the room lighting. The rooms are dark at night which can be a hardship when trying to get ready to go out. During the day, the floor to ceiling windows - with incredible views provide more than enough light. One other thought is the RR's distance to downtown and the strip. Even before staying at the RR, I have learned that it is more economical to rent a car - unless you know in advance you're staying close to your base hotel. Therefore, since we rent a car, the distance of the RR from the strip is not a problem for us - a 20 minute car ride. Valet and self parking on the strip is a hassle and that is where cabs are an advantage. In closing, my wife and I liked the RR so much, we have booked another trip in December. This was less than 24 hours after we got home.", "Date": "March 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kent, Washington", "Title": "\u201cI had a magical experience at Red Rock Casino Hotel.\u201d", "Author": "Leycrow", "ReviewID": "UR99200894", "Content": "The staff at Red Rock Casino was the best of the rest..the room I was in was everything I could I asked for..I had a great experience..thank you RED ROCK.", "Date": "March 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Canada", "Title": "\u201cStyle and value away from the hustle of the strip\u201d", "Author": "surf_n_sun_Canada", "ReviewID": "UR99193820", "Content": "Just back from 3 nights at the Red Rock.

Kids enjoyed a movie and we even found time to bowl! Hotel is a 10-15 minute drive from the strip and shopping, however we love the local restaurants (Cheescake factory 2-3 min drive), and renting a car in Vegas is less than $40/day taxes in. We did not use the free strip/airport shuttle this trip, however have used it in the past to compliment the rental car. ie my wife took the free shuttle down to fashion island, and I picked her up later. For those of you who are wavering on the 10-15 minute drive to the strip, I ask you this. Next time you are staying on the strip, and you need to just zip over to the casino next door, I suggest that it takes as long if not longer to walk through the commotion on the strip, as it does to drive (and park) from the Redrock.

Also most hotels I stay in the wifi is usually very slow but I did not find this the case at the Red Rock. The free connection is a huge plus. I didn't get the opportunity to check out the pool area but it looked very nice. The food court might be your best deal if you are looking just to get a quick lunch and don't want to spend a whole lot of money. The food I ate their was very good especially the cheese steak which gave me a taste of being back home in Philly. I did notice the buffet prices were really really reasonable but I didn't have enough time to check it out and the lines I have to admit were pretty long but that is not always a bad thing since you know the food must be good. So many other things that were nice about the Red Rock but just to some it up I was very happy with everything at the Red Rock and had a very pleasant stay. They also provide free shuttle service so check that out.

The hotel is earthy, yet glitzy...not tacky and only about a 15 minute drive to the strip and 20 min to the airport. The standard rooms and bathrooms are very spacious and the beds/linens are TO DIE FOR comfortable. I peeked into a larger suite while housekeeping left the door open and it was also very large with beautiful sectionals and huge flatscreen TVs.....would make for a very swanky group stay. The food served during the summit was very good and always appropriately hot/cold (which seems to be impossible at other hotels). The pool area was very large & inviting although it was too cold to swim. There are several restaurants within the hotel (that I heard were very good, although I did not get to experience them 1st hand sadly). The only complaints I have about this hotel are that the room had minimal lighting and it was somewhat difficult to see even during the day with all the lights on and the shades curtains open. There was no coffee pot in the room (because there is a Starbucks in the lobby area and room service coffee was VERY pricy). I also waited in long lines during check-in in and my colleagues waited in a long line while checking out (to obtain a receipt for business expense).

I choose Red Rock based on reviews on this site and I am incredibly disappointed. The place is WAY over-priced, relative to Vegas and not at all an enjoyable experience. 1) I chose this place based on reviews claiming it relatively friendly to kids, what they did not say was just how much one has to go through the casino, to get anywhere. One can not get a bite to eat or do any of the kid friendly activities without trekking through the entire extremely smoky and stuffy casino. I don't mind the gambling, but the smoke is TERRIBLE, and people even smoke near my smoke free room in the hotel itself. I don' t know what makes this hotel more kid friendly than others, but the SMOKE is a disaster. 2) Many people said that the hotel staff were friendly and helpful and I feel like I am in a different hotel. The staff lack basic knowledge about their own hotel, I kept on getting contradictory information, such as pool openings, spa offerings, buffet pricing etc... I had to run after them 4 times to get a tiny fridge in my room a day later than promised (tinier than other hotel fridges, too tiny to fit anything really). Any time I asked the reception a question, they acted as if they were doing me a huge favor in answering. I did not feel welcome. I am a seasoned traveller and the staff is considerably less friendly than what I regularly encounter at hotels around the world. 3) The room is far more expensive than most in Las Vegas, and especially for being off strip I had higher expectations. For example, the beds were low quality considering the price of the hotel, I was not comfortable. Another example, there was no coffee maker/coffee in my room, like most hotels. Also, I developed a headache, likely from from all the unavoidable smoke everywhere in the hotel, when I asked for Advil (most hotel receptions have some) I was sent to the gift shop, to pay $3.50 for 2 Advil pills. To cash in like that on my headache, after all I paid the hotel, a slap in the face. They could have at least sold a full bottle at reasonable prices. It is little things like that, again and again throughout the day, that made the experience bad. We did not enjoy ourselves. Our one positive experience was at the hotel, Hachi the Japanesse restaurant was excellent. It was like being transported to another place with excellent food, service and atmosphere. The entire family really enjoyed that meal very very much, food and atmosphere, but that is pretty much the only thing we enjoyed at the resort.", "Date": "December 22, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "matthews, nc", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel - way off the strip\u201d", "Author": "biilsusan", "ReviewID": "UR89510664", "Content": "We just returned from a 4 day stay @ Red Rock Casino Resort.

We stayed a week. Yes, that is rather long but we needed to get away. Everything Trip Advisor says about the shuttle from the airport is absolutely true. We missed a shuttle from the airport because 1) we didn't know exactly where to go on ground zero (first set of benches, not the farther second set) and 2) we didn't know what the shuttle looked like. Apparently the bus with the big Red Rock signage was out of commission. We were in no rush and stayed at the airport and got something to eat/drink until the next shuttle. During the rest of the week we traveled down to the strip several times. Work your schedule around the shuttle that takes you down to the Fashion Show Mall / Strip to do what you need to do. Just keep in mind that the last one back to the hotel stops running around 9:30 pm. So, you will need to do a taxi if you do a show. Or, you can do what we did which was rent a car for the day. The hotel concierge helped coordinate it for us. $50 a day for an intermediate that is delivered to the hotel. It was perfect for what running around we wanted to do. The hotel is almost in a residential area (Sumerlin) but has a fabulous view of either the strip or the red rocks. The rooms are reminiscent of the Wynn and rather nice. Only issue were, the doors to the room were heavy (yet not sound proof from the hallway noise) so when you close it it does so rather hard. At 2 am in the morning that is the last thing you will want to hear. And, although the bathrooms were a beautiful marble with a deep soaking tub and tv, we had issues getting the temperature right on the shower. We didn't complain because it wasn't our water bill. Oh, one more thing. We did each of the restaurants in the hotel for either lunch or dinner. T-Bones, the high end steakhouse was terrible. I certainly don't mind paying for a good steak, however, this was grossly overpriced for what we received and the service was only average. The sushi bar (forgot the name) was actually very good along with the mexican cafe. All in all, I would definitely go back. The movie theater and bowling ally are a great touch.

Arrival: The hotel offers a FREE shuttle to and from the hotel. Somebody mentioned that they paid for this service. Somebody is wrong, but I can certainly attest to the fact that I did not pay a dime to use the shuttle during my trips to and from the airport. The hotel is nowhere near the strip, being about 20 miles away from the airport & strip area. It\u2019s definitely isolated, but some people like that. Check-In Process & Reception Area: The check-in staff was extremely efficient and helpful. I was at the desk for less than 3 minutes and on my way up to the room in no time. The reception area is beautiful and quiet as the Casino is located on the floor above. There is a fantastic bar area here in the reception area as well. Trip to the Room: Most Casino/Hotels have you haul your luggage through the casino on the way to the elevator bank, which is annoying as hell. Not so at Red Rocks, as the elevator bank is about 100ft from the reception area. Very nice. If your room number is above the 30\u2019s, bring your track shoes, because the trip to the room from the elevator is a HIKE. You pretty much have to walk the entire length of the hotel building to get to your room, but this not a biggie in my opinion, but it should be mentioned. Most hotels in Vegas are like this due to the massive sizes of the buildings. The Room: My first impression of my room was excellent. The room was spacious, and had two double beds. There is a small desk area with an internet connection, and a lounging area in front of the big window that offered me a tremendous view of the strip 20 miles away. The bathroom was cavernous, with double sinks, a tub with a TV, a separate shower, and a separate area with the commode. The temperature concerned me when I first walked into the room, but you can control the thermostat and adjust the temperature to your liking. The Food: We were a bit hungry from our trip so we had a late lunch in the caf\u00e9 on the way into the casino. The food was delicious and the service was excellent. On subsequent days, I ate at the breakfast buffet, which was your typical Vegas buffet style. All of the food was delicious and the service was excellent. I did not eat dinner on the property, but I understand the steakhouse is recommended. There is a Starbuck on premises as well as a gift shop that also has basic toiletries. The Conference Area: I was here for a conference, and while there were about four conferences going on, the hotel did a magnificent job of segregating everyone to their respective areas. Eating lunch on the veranda was fantastic, as it afforded a view of the Red Rock canyon. The facilities to hold a conference we\u2019re top rate and first class. The production crew was incredibly helpful and I can see why its desirable to have a conference at this location. The Casino: The Casino is your typical Vegas casino. The layout is circular with a very nice & quiet bar located dead center of the casino. You have everything here, table games, craps, blackjack, roulette, slots, etc. My luck was not so good here though! Pool Area: The pool area is as nice as any hotel in Vegas. It was on the chilly side while I was here, but the environment is very relaxing and there are tons of spots to sit with people or quietly to read. Service here is also excellent. Cherry Nightclub: The club was reserved for a private party for my company, but I can certainly see how this place could become a hotspot on the weekends. It\u2019s a spacious club with an excellent sound system and a well laid out bar area. I got a kick out of the bathroom, as the urinals we\u2019re shaped like lips. Very funny stuff. Staff: Any encounter with the staff was a pleasant experience. Everyone was very helpful or went out of their way to ensure I got the help I needed. Check Out: I checked out electronically, no issues with my bill and the shuttle got me to the airport without a hitch. Summary: The hotel is a very nice property. It could easily fit on the strip. It\u2019s an excellent self-sustaining facility that one would never have to leave to get their Vegas experience. I understand why companies have conferences here, as it allows for employees to still have fun, but limiting the amount of trouble they get into and also guarantee attendance to the conference events. If I do go back to Vegas, I would, however, prefer to stay at hotel on the strip. Taking nothing away from Red Rocks, as it was an excellent experience, I prefer the hustle & bustle of the strip. Just as an FYI, cab rides to and from the strip from Red Rocks run approximately $45 bucks, so that was kind of a downer. I heard that there is a shuttle that would take you to the strip, but unsure if there was a cost involved. Bottom line is that I recommend the hotel.", "Date": "November 2, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Joliet, il", "Title": "\u201cThe Best Resort in Vegas\u201d", "Author": "SaraPaterson", "ReviewID": "UR85675361", "Content": "It's like 20 miles away from the hustle and bustle of the strip, however if you want a nice classy, scenic, relaxing place to stay I highly recommend this place. The casino is laid out perfectly, They have the same friendly workers at the table games year after year, they hire locals and Americans that can communicate English and grammar well. Which I find a problem at some other casinos on the strip. The rooms are very clean., nice with marble floors flat screen tv's they even have a flat screen above the bathtub with the sound coming from the ceiling. I had a cannon view which was very nice. It would have been nice to see the Cherry Club open this year it closed down and also the Cherry pool area. As a consumer and table game player, Black Jack, Roulette and Craps this is the place you want to wager you money at. They are honest in the casino and will bend over backwards to serve you, like free cigarette pack tokens and anything you want to drink. T-Bones is a great up scale restaurant, I got the biggest Lobster Tail there I ever had in my life a 32 ounce Australian Lobster Tail which was done perfectly. The Feast Buffet is also one of the top 5 in Vegas the prime rib is out of this world. I just wish they had more seafood at the buffet. My only complaint upon checkout was a Indian mid manager trying to pound smoke up my butt on a issue he was trying to pass off and refused to own, that really upset me.

T Bones is excellent but pricey, but no more than in NYC or Miami. The table games are adequate. The pool is great, but BEWARE of screaming children in the summer months, they take over the pool.

In general the service was great. The only exception was at check in. We reserved a King non-smoking room. They had none available when we checked in and did nothing to offer us something else. They just told us our only option was a non-smoking room with two queens. It turned out ok, they just could have handled the situation a little better (it helps to apologize for the problem). The second problem was with the buffet. The food and selection was great. But, they had many choices of which line to get in and it was not clear which was the right one. We were seated and then told to go pay first before eating. The person who we paid made us show ID when we paid. I guess they get customers who sneak into the buffet without paying?

We did book the birthday package which included a suite, champagne and strawberries, free drinks vouchers and a few free bowling games.

It was a no go. She told us that the rooms are pre assigned when you make a reservation and she can't change that. We though maybe with the birthday and late arrival that would be a nice thing to do, but I guess not. We were very pleased with the regular king room and would not book a suite here again as the regular room is plenty big and nice with a fantastic soaking tub. When we did get into our suite it was pretty much the same room with a living room. The tub was now a jacuzzi tub but the black and white marbling of the tile made it all look dated. The shelves in the suite were very dusty as well. The Casino itself was great! We loved the bingo room and in the morning/afternoon you can find $5 blackjack. The pool was the best I have ever been, the big plush lounge chairs were fantastic. Most of the kids stay around the big pool and then there are 3 other smaller pools where most of the adults with no kids lounge. The drinks by the pool were great too. We ate at Yard house which was good, and they have the largest selection of draft beers. We ate at the buffet for breakfast which was good and were more surprised by the cheap price. Overall we had a great time and will stay here again, may even bring the kids with next time.

It\u2019s swanky, modern with all of the latest high-tech features. The location is quite far from the main Vegas strip, but that may be part of its appeal for many. This resort is like an indoor city of its own. Be sure to pack some cute walking shoes \u2013 walking from your room to the conference center and the casino can be a real workout. You may want to request a room near the elevator. The casino is massive and very impressive. I was there for business - wish I had more time to stay and play. The slot machines are a favorite. I even won some fast cash. This casino is nearly as packed as those on the main strip. It was nice to avoid all of the typical casino cigarette smoke. The outdoor pool was very inviting. If only I had more time to relax. The resort has several restaurants. The Italian restaurant was phenomenal! I\u2019d go back just for the dining experience alone. There are several other nice restaurants too - a steak house, Mexican restaurant, all-American diner, a buffet and others. They have a huge food court \u2013 Sbarro Pizza, Ben & Jerry\u2019s, Stabucks, Tropical Smoothie, etc. During my 4 day stay, I became a loyal customer of Tropical Smoothie. But on the 4th day, my breakfast turned sour. Here\u2019s what happened\u2026 Each morning, I ordered a toasted bagel with cream cheese. The same young woman waited on me. Half way through my breakfast, I ran out of cream cheese \u2013 so I requested an extra packet. The same woman obliged my request without hesitation. On my last day, I was so pleased with her customer service that I actually planned to tip her. Rarely (almost never) do I tip a fast food counter employee. Suddenly, little Miss Tropical Smoothie did something that warranted me canceling her tip. You\u2019ll never believe what happened next\u2026 So, I placed my standard order for a bagel w/ cream cheese. This time, I requested extra cream cheese in advance. She smiled in acknowledgment. I felt like a \u201cTropical Smoothie regular.\u201d But, the total on the cash register was different this time \u2013 it was much more expensive than my previous breakfast orders. I immediately noticed and pointed this out. It must be an honest mistake. Her explanation was cheerful and matter of fact -- they charge for extra cream cheese. Ok, well that\u2019s no big deal \u2013 it can\u2019t be much. I reached for my wallet to settle up for the extra charge \u2013 I then realized it will cost over $3.00 more. She then explained that she had to charge me for the previous 3 days of extra cream cheese. I laughed, but this was no joke. I didn\u2019t understand why she had not made this clear during my previous visits. The \u201cextra\u201d charge wasn\u2019t even listed on their menu, nor had she bothered to tell me it normally costs a buck extra. I was led to believe it was \u201ccomplimentary.\u201d I was so dumbfounded by her sneaky back-log-tally-tactic for extra cream cheese. At the time, I didn\u2019t have time to debate the extra charge as I was checking out that day and headed to the airport. I wonder if Lil Miss Tropical Smoothie ever remembered that she forgot to charge me for a 4th packet of cream cheese. I actually ordered 4 bagels w/ extra cream cheese during my Red Rock Resort stay. Perhaps that extra packet of cream cheese was \u201con the house.\u201d Of course I won\u2019t let Lil Miss Tropical Smoothie\u2019s shadiness interfere with my overall impression of Red Rock Resort. We had a beautiful posh room with a distant night view of the Vegas Strip. The bathroom was one of the most luxurious I have seen. It had double sinks, marble shower, private toilet closet, and a sleek flat screen TV above a roomy tub. This hotel inspired my husband to install a new TV in our bathroom at home. I highly recommend this hotel to others. I'm pretty sure cocktails are still complimentary while you play in the casino. Just be advised that you won't be able to score any free cream cheese at the food court.

Valet greeted me with a warm welcome, 2 bellman offered me assistance, the door was opened for me with a smile, and the front desk looked genuinely happy to see me. At check-in I was informed by Angel that my room was not yet ready (I was quite early). She took my cell number, informed me that she would call me as soon as the room was ready, and directed me to the spa. The spa was amazing (as everything else in the hotel). They had full amenities in the spa, and after relaxing in the hot tub while enjoying complimentary ice cold bottled water, we were able to freshen up and head back out to the airport to pick up friends. On the way out, a bellman (Rick) gave us very clear and concise directions to the nearest liquor store. =) On the way back from the airport, we got a call to inform us our room was ready. The room blew me away. It was spotless, well coordinated, and had a breathtaking view. Throughout our entire stay, everyone we encountered was friendly and helpful. The casino had more than enough tables to accommodate everyone regardless of their gambling preference. I ate 3 times at the hotel. First night I ate at the buffet. It was good. 2nd night I ate at LBS (a burger joint). My burger was great, friendly service, and fun atmosphere. Next night I had dinner at Terra Rossa (Italian dining). Again, we had a very fun, friendly server. Despite the fact that we showed up with a party of 12 without reservations, they seated us rather quickly in a private room in the back. Food was great, promptly served, and fair priced. Used the concierge and front desk several times for directions, they were always helpful- especially Brett at the front desk. This hotel gets 5 thumbs up! I highly recommend it for group business, as they have the ability to accommodate large numbers, and provide a variety of activities and shows. It is a self sufficient resort and I found it hard to leave the hotel at night for the Strip.

We are frequent Las Vegas travelers for business and pleasure with more than 50++ stays in the area. This was the first time we decided to stay off the strip. The reason for our visit was to just get away, relax, gamble a bit and not have to deal with the typical Las Vegas crowd. We also wanted to experience life away from the lights and noise. Overall, the resort is well appointed. There are plenty of places to eat and enjoy music and night life. In addition, you don't feel too secluded as there are many restaurants off property within walking distance or just a short drive away. There is a large 16 screen cinema connected to the resort and a large bowling facility. We immediately noticed the hospitality. No stuffy Las Vegas concierges or wait staff.....everyone was very personable and friendly. The resort is very kid friendly and the main pool was loaded with kids between 10:30 am and about 3:00 pm when the pool thinned out a little for adults. There is an adults only area (Cabana Club) on the weekends, but this resort was certainly family friendly. Year after year, I have always been one to do anything to NOT take children to Las Vegas, but I can assure you that the reasons I choose to not expose my children to Las Vegas are all washed away at this resort....The place is well decorated and classy. The pool is great....the main pool has a large center fountain that everyone can enjoy. There are a variety of open seating options including in pool seats, round lounge beds and secluded lounge areas throughout. For eats, we visited T-Bones steak house....good meal and the prices are moderate. There is Italian, Spanish and other restaurants as well that all look great. The sports book is huge and I have never seen so many televisions and projection screens in my life! We visited the spa and I would say the ameneties were average. If you are looking for a luxury spa that includes the indulgences of the Wynn, Bellagio or Venetian, then pass.....but the treatments were good and the staff was again great. I have a couple small complaints - the gaming was sub par. Slot games, video poker and video Keno (one of my favorites) were all strange to me. I did not see many \"main stream\" games that you find at the bigger hotels in Las Vegas.....(Wheel of Fortune slots and others). That's ok, because I probably saved $250 bucks not gambling as a result. As I mentioned, we just returned......today and as of 6pm today (July 19, 2010) the resort was boasting a whopping 110 degrees.....Why do I bring this up? I think the hotel might have insufficient air conditioning for the climate. The room we stayed in would not cool to the frozen standards I have seen at other hotels, the elevators were all warm or very hot....seriously strange. Summary....overall, I have to say that I am planning a trip back to this property. I am sold that you can bring kids to Vegas and have fun without bombarding them with sex and hooker cards (if you go to Vegas often, you know what I mean). I plan to return, hit the pool, relax, probably go to another spa treatment and try some of the other eateries on property. I will take the family bowling near by, eat off property, drive the 15 extra minutes to the strip for an adult night and return relaxed.

First, I would recommend renting a car from the airport instead of paying $50 each way for a taxi. I had a rental for an entire week that totaled $104 with tax. The property itself is well maintained and is near shopping, restaurants, grocery stores, etc. Parking is plentiful and it is a short walk from the garage to the hotel. Definitely a benefit over the strip hotels. The casino is definitely one that caters to the locals and it is not too crowded. There are many choices for dining, a movie theater and a bowling alley which makes it a nice place for those traveling with family. I have only some a minor issue with Red Rock. I booked my room back in November 09 and specifically requested a canyon view room. I confirmed this reservation a week before leaving and all was fine. On arrival and after checking in I went to my 18th floor room and found a lovely view of the\u2026\u2026Las Vegas strip. The woman at the front desk who checked us in was not very friendly and had a bit of an attitude so I assume this was due to her apathy or inattentiveness. I called the front desk and was told that they must be out of canyon view rooms and that was why I was moved to a strip facing room. The attendant went on to tell me that they did not have any canyon rooms when I made my reservation but could move me to a one if I wanted to move. ????

I was happy that I did not have to have a long walk to the elevators as most Vegas hotels/casinos are designed. The rooms were spacious and the bathroom was luxurious. The beds are comfortable. The entrance to the rooms are away from the main hall to minimize the noise level. I slept well. A few plumbing problems: toilet kept running, a part of the plumbing from the tub came off. Housekeeping did not seem on top of it. Minor things like not making it to my room to freshen it up during the day, and yes the notice was on. Dirty cups left a couple of days in the hallway. I did get a chance to use spa/fitness center. The spa facility is beautiful. However, I think that the fitness room is just okay. Again minor things, noise levels while you are getting a massage was a bit annoying. The constant question of \"are you a local?\" As if it meant a code for something, perhaps better service. There are a million other questions to ask, but I was asked about 5 times from 5 different staff members. I just thought it was a bit much. Not a big deal. Massage was great.

We go to Vegas maybe 6 times a year and Red Rock has always been our favorite because of the beautiful rooms, wonderful spa and proximity to the Red Rock Canyon. On the positive side: the bathrooms each have a TV over the bathtub, marble bathrooms, spacious rooms, comfy beds, far from the strip traffic jams, and hotel guests are welcome to use the spa and fitness center. Red Rock, I was more than a little disappointed this last weekend. I had requested 2 beds and when I got there, we were stuck with either a King only or 2 queens in a handicap room. Now I've stayed in a handicapped room before and it was no fun, the shower curtain had mildew on it, so we had to opt for the single bed option. Nobody offered an alternative, like an upgrade. When we got up to the room, the shampoo bottle was already half empty!!! And there was soap grime on the conditioner bottle, so obviously your housekeeper did not bother to change it. Now, this gave me the willies, because obviously, whoever cleaned the room, did not pay attention to cleanliness and I spent the whole weekend not wanting to step into the shower. The next day, I went to the pool and was stopped even though I had a card key, they wanted a wristband and said it should've been in my room. What? So, he said, go to the lobby and get one. I went to the lobby, waited, and the front desk lady asks me suspiciously, didn't the person who checked you in give you one? No, i answered. Well, then we need to see your ID and room key. Now, what if i didn't have my ID on me? I would've had to backtrack again to get that. Luckily I did. And what's with the third degree? I'm a guest, should not be treated like a suspect. I decided at this time to tell her about the half empty shampoo bottle, she then proceeded to call housekeeping to send another one up for me right then. I told her not to bother my roommate, who was sleeping. She ignored me and kept calling housekeeping. When she hung up, i had to ask her again firmly to cancel that request. Then i decided to visit the spa and there was mold on the fruit!!! Ugh! I used to love coming to Red Rock, but since I've been 1. treated like a teenager, 2. not listened to, 3. was not given wristbands at check-in, 4. experienced poor room toiletries, and 5. saw moldy fruity, I am very suspicious of another experience there and probably won't go again unless they comp me.", "Date": "June 6, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Missouri", "Title": "\u201cDon't dwell on Negative Reviews\u201d", "Author": "Diabloshrmp", "ReviewID": "UR66665045", "Content": "My girlfriend and I recently stayed three nights here during the first week of June.

(spent our wedding night at the Nugget's new Rush tower) We paid significantly more than some of our travel companions who got last minute deals on the Strip, and handsomely for a cab back out the next day, but several things made it worth it. 1) the spa. I cannot say it enough, the spa amenities alone are worth the resort fee. A decent gym, nice lap pool, hot tub, steam room, sauna, tea, fruit, water, use of a robe, slippers and nice toiletries are all included, gratis. Also available by appointment are massages and treatments, which while pricey,if the massage I had was any example of typical quality, are WONDERFUL. The facility is really nice, really clean, and have soothing pipe/flute nature-y music piped in. There are magazines to browse in the sitting areas as well as cold towels and water on ice outside of the steamroom/saunas. The lighting is muted, with red and blue accent-lights, and there are clean towels everywhere you turn. 2) The staff was beyond helpful, sending housekeeping up at 11pm to get pants that needed hemmed last minute for the next day, and providing an in-room fridge ($15 a day..grr) within a few minutes of our request. I don't know what happened that made other people review the staff poorly, our experiences were quite the opposite. (Well, aside from one unhelpful pool \"guard\" who couldn't just tell me where the darn potties were, I didn't want a tour that he couldn't finish, when pointing would have sufficed.) 3) being off the Strip has it's bonuses. It's a straight shot down Charleston to either the Strip by the Strat or Red Rock Canyon if you have a car. We ate lots of BK breakfast wraps because there is one in the Plaza right across the street, as well as a McD's, Albertson's and a CVS. After trying to get out of the Venetian on a Saturday night, and seeing $20 breakfast buffets this is a good thing to us. 4) The canyon view is AMAZING. As is the pool. Oh, and the food court wasn't overpriced at all..it was your typical food-court prices. And the Fatburger is open 24 hrs, which comes in handy when you need a 2 am post gambling/drinking protein-fix. The bad? It wasn't cheap. Seriously, a Coors Light in a can is the same price as your top-shelf margarita elsewhere in the world.

I almost switched hotels at the last minute. Don't listen to those reviews! Probably lost alot of money in the casino or something (which I did but that's my fault). Red Rock Hotel and Casino was great! We rented a car, quick and easy at Enterprise even using a debit card.Arrived at the hotel and valet parked. Great service! Check in was easy and painless. Asked them to remove all the snacks that I had read about because I was concerned with a 3 yo costing me quite a bit if she got ahold of them. No problem, it was taken care of within a half hour. Room-Beautiful. Nice view of strip. Clean and comfy. I miss the bathroom already it was grand! Marble,counter /w double sinks seperate tub and shower and a tv which we didnt try but the 3 yo thought that was really cool. Our room was by the elevators and it was suprisingly quiet. Pool-Wow! DH said that this was the best part especially how pretty all the girls where that worked there lol. I knew there was a reason why he insisted on giving me a break daily and took our dd to the pool. Seriously though, he was not searched and he was not hounded to buy drinks like other reviews said. Casino- Tight, tight, tight. They all are though. That's how they build the fancy hotels in Vegas so dont expect to win a new car or thousands of dollars. I spent $800 and that was $300 over what I budgeted. Will have a little more control next time and leave the bank card with dh lol. DH played texas holdem the whole vacation and he had a great time. Dining- The buffet twice, good food and well priced. Pleasantly suprised that they had fried okra at breakfast. I am from Florida and you never see that here. I love it! Ate at the cafe breakfast 2 days and dinner 2 days including mother's day which was delicious. KidsQuest- I can't say enough. My 3 yo hates daycare, refused to go to kids club on carnival cruises the 3x we took her because she said they where mean. Kids Quest, my dd wanted to stay there forever! One day we left her while we had a peaceful lunch and when we picked her up she hugged me and yelled \"this is the best vacation ever\". Wow, if they got that out of her they earn big kudo's from us.

We drove down the strip and we where going to stop and see the tiger show but our dd fell asleep on the car ride. It was still nice to drive down the strip and see some of the sights.

We were told that a refrigerator would be supplied at an extra cost - no problem. When we arrived no refrigerator and we could not get one. Only after two days of constant calls to the desk a refrigerator was supplied. 2) The pool closes at 5:00 PM Go figure. We were told that the pool was heated. Not true. Pool temperatures in the 60F degree range. 3) The pool area whirlpool tubs were O.O.C. We like heated whirlpools, but both were down. After two days they got one working but it was not heated. cold, cold cold. The pool area manager was very apologetic however. 4) They do not allow you to bring your own drinks or snacks to the pool area. Two frozen margaritas were $35.82. And then they wanted a tip! They actually inspect your hand bags before you are allowed in the pool area. Totally humiliating. 5) Unsavory people in the Grand Cafe. This is an incident I could not believe. We went for breakfast and there were two \"boyz from the hood\" types sitting in a both mocking some of the resorts older guests. Finally, an older man whose wife the two punks were making fun of got angry and confronted the two punks. The punks threatened the older man and the waitress made the two punks move to a table in the back of the Grand Cafe - not leave just move. We asked the waitress about the incident, and she said the two punks worked for the Red Rock as night shift bartenders. Incredible. When we asked the front desk why this was allowed to go on they said they did not believe us. Even though we gave them the name of the waitress. the time the incident happened and a full description of the punks. They did not even check it out. 6) If you do make the mistake of staying here keep in mind this resort is thirty minutes from the strip. The resort has shuttle service, but the last shuttle is at 9:20 PM just when the strip starts getting exciting. If you stay later it is an $80.00 cab ride if you can get a cab. 7) The restaurants are extremely expensive, but the food in mediocre. Not bad just mediocre. Not worth the price. The Olive Garden across the street had better food at half the price. 8) There is a $25.00 dollar per day resort fee. God knows what this is for; maybe just to breath the air. 9) I would never stay here again.

W A Y down\u201d", "Author": "MarkBeres", "ReviewID": "UR62418269", "Content": "Red Rock is a total disappointment, and I give it a well-earned thumbs down. Without question, the reason for my harsh review is the service - it was so aweful as to be embarrasing. When it comes to a resort of this 'perceived' esteem, a traveller expects more. In that environment, service isn't \"one of\" the things travellers key in on - service is EVERYthing. The entire guest chain, from booking, arrival, checkin, interim service, in-room service, housekeeping, checkout, et. al., was down-the-line terrible. First, be very aware that the advertised \"shuttle from the airport\" is on THEIR schedule, not yours. Red Rock is NOT close to the McCarran airport - rather, it is a good 20-30 minute drive from the airport. So, at $75, a taxi is simply out of the question (unless money is no object). Think about it - the money you 'save' by staying off-the-strip is quickly piled back onto you when you consider just commute to and from the airport. A round trip by taxi is going to run you $150. So, if you don't take my advice and insist on staying at this place, you need to add that on to your budget. Unless you take their shuttle. If you do so, it runs at 6P, 8P & 9P. If you get into Vegas around 7P, you get to wait with the throngs of people trying to get to the Strip. A better option is to rent a car. A 3-day rental ran me $100 total, and I had the convenience of coming and going as I pleased. Trust me - you'll want to leave the hotel and go to the Strip, or to hike. More on this in a moment. Lastly on this, when I called the hotel to inquire about the shuttle (on my cellphone from the airport), the guy on the other end was rude, uncaring, unconcerned, and he pretty much gave me the impression of, \"well, too bad, sucks to be you\". That attitude - that arrogant, condescending attitude exhibited by this single person at the beginnning of my stay, was an attitude that runs through the entire staff at Red Rock Casino, Resort & Spa. I am not embellishing for effect - the service here is THAT bad. Once you arrive at Red Rock Resort, you immediately feel like you're in a prison. The check-in attendant will greet you with a smile, hand you a small bottle of water (which was a nice touch), then put $300 \"pre charge\" on your credit card and give you the rules. Pay attention - the in-room minibar drinks & snacks are \"weight sensitive\", and if you pick up a minibar item, you have 45-seconds to put it back or else \"big brother\" automatically charges you. This may seem like something small, but let me tell you - when you enter your room, the minibar is like kryptonite. You deliberately find yourself avoiding it, not looking at it, walking around it - whatever, to avoid being charged for a tiny bag of peanuts at $4.99/bag. \"Big Brother\" is everywhere in this place, and it is the CREEPIEST thing. They have an in-room button that you push to identify your room as \"do not disturb\". Be careful - it looks like a lightswitch, and it's easy to inadvertently hit it. I did this in fact, and the big brother central computer system monitors whether or not your button is pushed. So, my room wasn't cleaned. True - it was me who pushed this button and didn't realize it, but big brother verified this on the central Red Rock computer mainframe, just to make sure I wouldn't be \"comp'd\" unnecessarily for complaining about it. Folks, this place is watching you with a fine-tooth'd comb. It was just a discomfort to me, and downright creepy. Red Rocks' rooms are not iPod friendly. They have a nice Bose radio/CD player in the room, and I believe it has an Aux port, but I didn't use it. There is no docking station, however. The last thing I want to warn travellers about regarding Red Rocks is the prices. You simply need to brace yourself, but you will be stunned at what dining, drinking & playing here costs you. One Mojito drink in a plastic cup at the pool cost me $19. I am not kidding, either. The volume of the cup is probably a pint and no more, if that. The food is even more expensive. Hungry? How 'bout some chips n salsa! It's only gonna run you $12. How about a nice Chateau Briand at the T-Bones Chophouse? Can you say $99? A nice glass of red wine is gonna run you between $12 to $30. As a recommendation, I suggest you bring your own wine and enjoy it in your room. At the pool, a way to save some money is to buy a pitcher of Mojitos - it'll run you $50, but contains about 4 individual servings. So, at $19 per, you save about $26 by going with the pitcher. Finally, the service. Everywhere in this resort, the service was horrible. The only people I saw smiling were the pool staff outside, and I give them a thumbs-up. Not one single casino worker, nor a house staff, and especially NO ONE at arrival or certainly checkout smiled on time. I swear, the people at Motel 6 smile infinitely more than these folks. At checkout, upon my insistent and persistent complaining of the terrible service we received (for a different issue), the manager comp'd us a single in-room service and one day's resort fee. I'm not complaining - that was appreciated, but I thought it was a cop-out by the staff, since I made very clear that the service and experience we received at Red Rocks was abysmal and anything but sub-par. So, if you get terrible service (which is quite likely), don't expect the Red Rocks staff to stand behind their gurantees - they'll throw you a small bone and whisk you on your way. Red Rocks isn't all bad, and I have to give some credit to the Lbs burger joint (which is awesome) and the pool & pool staff. Red Rocks' pool is one of the most beautiful I have ever seen, and the pool staff was excellent. Red Rocks is a really beautiful resort, but there are a LOT of beautiful resorts in Las Vegas. What sets one place apart from its peers is UNQUESTIONABLY service, and in that department, Red Rocks is totally lacking and fails in all categories. After my experience here, I cannot recommend this place. For my Las Vegas trip, I would stay, play, dine and unwind elsewhere. Given the commute out to Summerlin, you save nothing by staying \"off the Strip\". And, given the terrible service at Red Rocks, you'll probably get treated better on the Strip, too. As an addendum - we did go hiking at the Red Rocks park. This was definitely a nice part of the trip, and Red Rocks is ideally-situated near this park (it's NOT within walking distance ... you'll need a car), which was a really nice thing. So, as far as location, my bad review is primarily focused on the cost of getting to and from Red Rocks Resort from the airport, given that their shuttle service is inconvenient and suits their needs, not the traveller's. But, once you're out there, if you do not take a hiking trip (or just a sight-seeing drive-thru) to the Red Rocks Park, you're really missing a great part of Las Vegas that's not well-known.", "Date": "April 25, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "now", "Title": "\u201cThe \"other\" Las Vegas - go to get OFF the strip\u201d", "Author": "lostinthesupermarket", "ReviewID": "UR62206295", "Content": "LOCATION: I've stayed in Vegas many times for work-related conferences and always on the strip.

ROOM: Nice size room with comfy bed, nice view and huge bathroom. Separate tub and shower - both were huge. Robes and high end, lime-scented amenities were nice. Double sink. Big lighted closet. I noticed a few stains on fabrics (eeww). Don't EVEN think about picking up an item from the mini bar because it has an electronic sensor and if you remove an item for more than 30 seconds your room gets charged. This was the source of much amusement amongst meeting-goers who had picked up the \"Love Kit....\" RESTAURANTS: We ate twice at the sushi bar - very good. The food court was convenient for lunch between meetings. Starbucks. PARKING: Ample and free - but again, you've driven 20 minutes from the Airport and you're off the strip. POOL: Beautiful design - but it was too cold during our stay to enjoy. CONFERENCE FACILITY: Meeting rooms were very large, well-lit and had windows and a balcony to get some fresh air. Nice food at cocktail reception and breaks. A/V and HVAC good. I'd recommend the hotel for a business meeting/conference. CASINO: Well, I'm not a gambler and I get the sense that serious players don't hang here. The dealers were kind and instructive to a novice like me. Very friendly.

There happened to be a soccer tournament nearby, so there were a lot of other kids too. The hotel was very nice, upscale even.

I did my HW and made sure we got a room close to the elevator, actually it was the first set of rooms after the elevator. We got adjoining rooms (traveled with 4 kids and a husband). The 3 big kids stayed in the 2 queens room, then my husband and I stayed with the baby in a crib. Plenty of room for all. I was a bit concerned when the front desk told me we were so close to the elevator, but there was absolutely no echoing in this hotel, it had great noise absorption. Another thing folks complained about was the sensor activated snack and drink display....no problem for us, we called housekeeping and requested they remove the whole thing. With a 2 year old we can only imagine the issues we would have with that. Food: loved the food court, everyone got what they wanted and the prices were the same as at home. No inflated price tags there. We did the buffet and paid twice as much as we did with the food court. Try Cappriato's (Deli) great sandwiches! Kidsquest: We loved it and so did the 2 year old, everytime we walked by it, he wanted to go in. They take 6 months to 12 year olds. It's like kids heaven in there. Bowling: fantastic bowling alley, great fun. Beds: so comfortable, didn't wake up the whole night, and my 2 year old slept till 8 or 9 each morning which he never does at home! Pool: Um, this wasn't so great. They only had 2 small pools heated. The other 4 or so pools were FREEZING. That really sucked. But the layout was nice and it would be nice to go back when the weather is warmer. SPA: Lovely, lovely, lovely. Take advantage of the $25 resort fee you're paying and hit the steam room, sauna and whirlpool. Just take your clothes, because they have everything you need down there.

There was both a desk & a small round table in the room. Closet is a good size. Food: Such an assortment of restaurants, all indoor & a short walk from the rooms! The Grand Cafe is open 24/7, so convenient for early or late softball games & insomniacs. Feast Buffet has a huge selection (get there early!). LBS had really good burgers. Hachi (Japanese) was a bit pricey & I've had better. There's also Starbucks, Italian & Mexican restaurants. Red Rock is in western Las Vegas. Not close to the Strip, but I liked the less hectic surrounding area. You feel like you're away & relaxing. Lobby is modern, colorful & stunning. Staff at front desk are very friendly & helpful. I would definitely stay again, softball or not! Bathroom was beautiful with granite floors & tile. Shower & tub were separate; so was the toilet with its own door.

From start to finish every single person we encountered went above and beyond. While I've stayed at many hotels that have a great front desk, or wonderful room service, it's rare to find this high a caliber staff consistently across all departments. I would note, as someone else did, that, if traveling with young children, it's a good idea to try to get a room near the elevator. It is a LONG walk to the end of the hall. The room was spectacular. Very posh (my daughter loved the TV in the bathroom) and very comfortable. The views were spectacular. We also took advantage of many of the hotel amenities. We loved the bowling alley (although it was wicked crowded on a Saturday night with 45 min waits), the arcade was my daughter's favorite place, and we even took a chilly dip in their insane pool! We had room service on several occasions, and, while expensive as all room service is, they do go above and beyond in delivery and presentation. My only bit of a complaint would be the schedule of the shuttle. It runs every two hours starting at 11am to the strip and every two hours to the airport. A two hour window is quite limiting and I would strongly suggest increasing the times it departs and picks up (we almost missed the 5:40p on the strop and would have had to stay the extra two hours OR pay $60 for a taxi).

Check in and arrival is very efficient for a big place and they have got good guest parking reasonably lose to the elevators. The design is modern, sleek and almost boutiquey - a bit too much of the translucent red panels, but other than that, really nice. The rooms are huge and very well designed and appointed. Downsides - the concession restaurants are pricey and not that great except for takeaways like Fatburger. There's really only one cafe for breakfast and that is very expensive. Wifi is also not free and if you put anything in the mini bar, the movement makes a charge to your room even though you have taken nothing - the check out girl I credited me back the $80 of mini bar stuff they had charged, but rather gracelessly.

We have two young children, who were mostly excited about the ten or so swimming pools at the hotel. The hotel is a good spot if you have young children, as there is a multiplex movie theatre, bowling alley, and children's play/care center on site. The restaurants were very mediocre, particularly the lower-priced, kid-friendly eateries. Some things to watch out for, that soured us on the hotel: (1) We needed high-speed Internet access, checked in advance, and were told that it was free in every room. It is not. The \"free\" Internet access does not hook up to anything and instead shunts you to a site where you have to pay for Internet access. We found that to be too much of a \"bait and switch\" for our tastes. (2) As mentioned, our children were excited about the pools. All of them were closed, and we were given no notice of that when booking our stay. Nevertheless, we were charged the full \"resort fee\" for our stay (about $27 additional per night). The hotel refused to discount it due to the closure of the pools. (3) This is the first hotel I have stayed in where none of our mobile phones would work in the room. They would only work down in the lobby or casino. As a result, we had to use the land line in the room. We made a few, very short (no more than 5 minutes) long distance calls to Los Angeles.

From McCarran airport, Red Rock is less than 20 minutes away by the less-traveled County 215, which seemed nearly empty except at rush hour. The entrance to the casino is the first thing you see, with water fountains by day and fire fountains by night. Drive all the way around to the hotel entrance, and use the valet parking, where the staff takes your car promptly and politely. The red glass doors are opened for you, and just to the right inside is the front desk, staffed with quietly friendly people who offer bottled water and any assistance you'd want as part of their new \"A3\" service. The elevators are hidden behind the lobby bar, and require a room key for access. We stayed in a 19th floor strip view room. The view was wonderful, especially at night, and seemed much nicer than our \"mountain view\" room last year, which was on the 3rd floor and gave us a view of the entry and valet parking more than the mountains. The bed was extremely comfortable, with clean and soft linens and plenty of pillows. The room decor is exactly as advertised on the website; remember to not touch the mini-bar items if you don't want to get charger. There are signs reminding you in-room, and the check-in staff also mentioned it to us. My favorite part of the Red Rock room was the bathroom - it contains a separate water closet, a shower with an incredible massage/rainshower showerhead, and best of all, a huge soaking tub. The bath amenities include bath salts as well as the usual shampoo, conditioner, and shower gel, two different soaps, and cotton balls, q-tips, and a sewing kit. The housekeeping staff replaces everything but the sewing kit during your stay. The room comes equipped with a doorbell/electronic notice, which you can set for privacy or to signal housekeeping to make up the room. If you have the \"do not disturb\" on past noon, someone will call your room to ask if you'd like anything (like extra towels.) A daily newspaper is left every morning (The Las Vegas Sun and the Review-Journal - a nice touch to have local papers rather than USA Today!) Being a cold December, the pool wasn't open, but there's enough to do on the property that we didn't miss it- an IMAX theatre, bowling alley, numerous restaurants including a food court, and the spa and shops as well as the casino. Our hotel promotion included 2 buffet meals, and we took advantage of the Feast buffet for a breakfast and a dinner. I must highly recommend the breakfast selections - perfectly crisp bacon, moist and flavorful scrambled eggs (plain, with cheese, or with onions and peppers), a huge selection of various ethnic breakfast specialties ranging from lox & red onions for bagels to chorizo gravy, and absolutely fresh fruits. The omelet station had a long line which moved quickly, and everyone seemed delighted by the dishes. Dinner selections we tried were all tasty, except for an odd-tasting mac and cheese. The carved roast beef, the freshly-rolled sushi, and numerous vegetable sides were more along the lines of a good cafe dinner than run-of-the-mill buffet food. The selection of pastries was on a par with other high-end hotel buffets - I recommend the shot-glass tiramisu especially! The hotel staff was friendly but deferential, and all went out of their way to please. When we arrived in our room, there were no bathrobes in the closet. A push of the A3 button on the phone, and a staff member was apologizing that it could take up to ten minutes. Within 5, the robes arrived with another apology.

Both dinner and brunch were very busy at Feast Buffet - which gets my vote for second best buffet in Vegas. Number One is Studio B at the M Resort - it is going to be very hard to beat that spread, which is so good it seems impossible that they can still do it. If you want to relax, unwind and not be subjected to tons of people everywhere trying to make it to their convention - I strongly recommend Red Rock - it is a 5 Star experience.", "Date": "November 27, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Canada", "Title": "\u201cCool Vibe, Great Rooms, All On a Techno Sound Track\u201d", "Author": "wwTraveler1", "ReviewID": "UR49919317", "Content": "Really enjoyed our four day stay here. It is a large hotel trying to have that South Beach boutique feel. I think it worked very well. Upon arrival, drove around looking for self parking. There isn't any as far as I could tell. That's actually OK here, because they have the best valet service I have ever experienced. Friendly, fast and enough staff to grab your car pronto. They always asked if I needed directions and always provided two little, ice cold Red Rock bottles of water. I liked the two rooms we had. The first was a \"Canyon View.\" Nothing wrong with the view except it isn't quite as close to Red Rock Canyon as their promotional pictures would have you believe. This side also has the pool view.... and Cherry Nightclub. Cherry Nightclub is a really serious design and execution flaw for this half of the hotel, because every Friday, Saturday and some Sunday nights, half the hotel guests aren't going to get any sleep 'till 4am when the \"boom boom\" stops pounding. You may as well go clubbing these nights, since you're listening to the music either way. I couldn't sleep even with earplugs. Day two, we were moved to a strip view room right across the hall on the 22nd floor. What a fantastic view of the entire Las Vegas Valley plus the strip front and center. In contrast to the Cherry Nightclub side, this was one of the quietest hotel rooms I have experienced. Everywhere you go in the hotel casino and even elevators, your life will be set to the techno soundtrack that plays like a 24 hour nightclub. I thought it was funny how you knew your elevator has arrived when you suddenly hear the beat \"doosh, dooosh doosh\" Room design an amenities were exceptional. Nice big 42\" plasma on the wall. The room even had a Bose Wave radio with a pretty good Red Rock Casino CD featuring more techno music. (In case you needed more since the elevator ride!) The pool was ultra hip and there were poolside blackjack tables. Wait staff and dealers were dressed for the part in skimpy bikinis. We were nicely surprised by the friendliness of all pool staff. One little caveat though... I have never had to go through a bag search in order to access my 4 star hotel's pool. Security? OK, I guess they want to keep non-guests out, but nooo they want to search your pool bag too. Why? \"To look for outside food and beverages\" Kinda tacky and almost a deal breaker for a repeat stay. Casino was nicer than most local's joints. Although it was surprisingly smoky even when not busy. Enjoyed the movie theaters and decent food court as well. Did not eat at any of the restaurants because right across the road are all kinds of mid priced places. Thought BJ's Brewhouse was exceptional. Islands is always good for lunch There are several others including Olive Garden. Costco, Albertsons and a small strip mall are all right across the street. To sum up: Beautifully designed four star hotel lacking certain considerations for the guest you would find at most other four star resorts.", "Date": "November 23, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "United States", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel for Great price at Red Rock\u201d", "Author": "mkover", "ReviewID": "UR49919002", "Content": "We got a great deal on the Red Rock so decided to go for the weekend.

It was with extended family from all parts of the country and the world. I have been to vegas over 50-times since a lot of my family lives in las vegas. I usually fly out to vegas about two to three times a year. A little background about me, I am a business college student who has extensive world-travel experience. I like luxury and usually 4-5 star hotels when I travel but I know when I get a good value and when it is overprice. I have stayed from a range of hostels in Europe to the Shangra-la in Asia. So, overall I prefer 4 stars and higher but I am not ignorant of cost. I payed about 135 a night for the hotel room, not including the resort fee. This included two free buffets and two free movie tickets. This is more than the hotels on the strip. This is about as much as a Paris stay or a good deal at the Bellagio. It is on the expensive side but there is no other hotel even near the Red Rock. It is the only hotel really in the area. This is NOT a hotel to stay at if you want to go to the strip. It really serves locals and those who are going to Red Rock Canyon. It is about 30 mins to the strip so it is far. Plus, the traffic and street lights suck. If you stay at Red Rock, do not plan on going to the strip much. Casino- They play the \"21\" movie sound track everywhere! The techno music tries to make it feel hip like the entire place is a Starbucks or a club. The hotel elevators BLARE the music. When the doors open on your hotel floor, the music fills the entire hallway. It is not too loud like at a club but you have to raise your voice to talk.The decor is great and modern. It has a very new feel. The entire design is basically minimalism with a splash of sixties colors. Red, orange, brown, and green are the main colors they play with in the entire resort. The chandeliers are amazing and well placed. Relating to the gaming, the actual slots do not pay out much (this is coming from my family who lives near the hotel). I mainly played the tables. I tripled my bet and won a 100 dollars at blackjack. Irena is great. She is from Greece and she was amazing. She told people when to double down. Rooms- I am used to staying at the other 4 star Station Casino called Green Valley Ranch. Red Rock and GVR are suppose to be the nicest Station casinos. Red Rock has nicer rooms and better furniture. The bathroom at Red Rock is very nice but the fixtures are kind of weird and over done. They give you everything you need. Plenty of towels. GVR has a much bigger room and bathroom. The Red Rock room is basic and small. If you spend more time in your room, a larger \"Resort\" room might be a good investment. i heard the suites are AMAZING! I do not know why they chose to make a small room, especially since it is supposed to be nicer than GVR. The TV in the bathroom is kind of pointless but a nice touch. The color of the marble is cool. The sliding door on the toilet seems like a afterthought. The main TV is nice. The A/C was great. Beds were very nice and the pillows were great. Most of the rooms are set back from the main hall with a private hall way for the room next door. So you only face one door. This reduces the noise a lot more than in GVR, which has a usual hotel design with all the doors facing the main hallway. I thought this was a good idea but it really does reduce the size of the room. Also, the only elevators from the casino is all the way at one end of the hallway. So if your room is above 130 be prepared to walk. I was the next to last room. It took about 3 mins to walk from one end to another. it is annoying but not a huge disadvantage. Red Rock was a quiet hotel from internal noise, but if you face the pool, be prepared for Cherry. Cherry- Cherry is their cool club. It is mainly local. The music is modern and decent. The design is really cool but if your room faces the mountain side thus the pool and the club, it has a potential for disaster for light sleepers.The club opens up the doors to the pool at 1:30 am till about 3:30. Even before that you can hear the bass in your room. I was at the 18th floor and all the way at the other end of the hotel. Basically, I was as far as I could get from the club. Yet the music was very very loud. It sounded like the TV was on. I finally called down to the front desk and complained. He said that he received a lot of complaints. I told him \"duh!\" After 30 mins they turned down the music a lot. This only happened one night at my stay and I heard other hotels on the strip do this and do not turn down the music, like Tryst and the Wynn. So it was nice that they did that but it should not happen to begin with. I feel bad from the rooms close to the club. So request city side not mountain side so you can sleep at night! Customer Service- This was a huge plus. The housekeeping was very very nice. I was honestly surprised. The Spa people were kind of rude but not surprised from a US hotel. Staying abroad at good 4-5 star hotels really spoils me as they know how to treat their customers. In America, we put up with more from the hotel staff. But I was surprised how nice the front desk, casino staff, and restaurant staff really were. The BIGGEST mistake the hotel made is with the 45 second rule on the snacks they leave out in the room. These are pressure censored snacks that sit on the platform that sends a signal somewhere. There is a sign that says if the snack is removed longer than 45 seconds they charge the room. This is EXTREMELY bad customer relations. I laughed out loud. Take some trust in your guests. If you want to move up a star, this must go. I know other LV hotels do this but it is inappropriate and un-needed. I know there is also a senor in the fridge because they tried to charge me for the entire fridge when i moved the stuff around for some water I bought. This whole idea comes across as trying to scam the guests and get everything out of them. This entire idea must go! I know someone from management will read this so I hope the comment on this. Take some effort and have the housekeeping look at the snacks. Spa and Pool- One of the strong points of the hotel. The main pool area is huge. There is not much shade but plenty of swimming space. If you like to tan, this is the place to be. The pool area is gorgeous. The spa is another strong point. The gym was very nice. It was above average and well cleaned. The spa pool was really quiet and almost no one was ever there. It is free for all guests. My recommendation is to go to the spa pool not the main pool. No one is usually there. Also the locker rooms were great. The hot tubs were amazing. Buffet- I think they lowered the prices dramatically. Breakfast is about ten and so is lunch. This is a steal. Before the economic downturn, it was about 20 dollars. It is a good buffet but do not expect a Mirage buffet or other top line casino food. It is good for the value. Overall, good place to stay if you are in the summerlin area. Stay here if you want to go do nature stuff in Red Rock Canyon. This is a good solid 4 and maybe leans to 4.5 with some possible improvements, such as upgrading the customer experience. This is above GVR. If this hotel was on the strip, it would have stiff competition. It would probably be above the Paris and MGM, on-line with the Mirage, but below the Venetian and Bellagio. The Suites at Red Rock might even be on par with the Sky Lofts at MGM which is a huge accomplishment.

After the pre-planned four day excursion with my nephew and his friend (his high school graduation present from me), I decided to quit my job, fly a few friends in, stay for a while and relax! Let's start with poolside where we started our vacation. The view of the pool from our 16th floor suite was spectacular, in the daylight and particularly lit up at night. The Red Rock staff of girls (Kai, Todd, Brad and Darnell weren't half bad either) were beautiful, always smiling and genuinely service oriented. The layout was cool, a series of pools and hot tubs with full bar and blackjack tables at one side, and cabanas lining the other side and back end. The bar offered food that was beyond what I would classify as \"bar food\" as well as a variety of colorful and fruity drinks. The absolute \"must drink\" is the Java Monkey, an iced delight of Starbuck's liquor and other sweet ingredients! Inside the casino our focus was on FOOD as we are not big gamblers. Don't misunderstand us though, we did indulge in moderate play of roulette, blackjack and slots within the casino. The food at T-Bones, Feast Buffet, Grand Cafe and Hachi were all memorable dining experiences at differing tiers. The menu at Hachi though offered such a wide variety of high-grade food, we dined there a total of eight times. The Spa was a relaxing and wonderful experience. We got haircuts, massages and utilized the exercise room daily. My favorite were the two massages I received from Julie. Ask for her by name because she's clearly qualified in deep tissue massage. To conclude this review I will assure you that I will be back to Red Rock Hotel & Casino very soon. The level of service, from valet to bellman to concierge and throughout the service staff inside and out of the casino, was impeccable! And don't be afraid to ask for a deal.

If you remove them from their position and don\u2019t put them back within 40 seconds (!) their cost will be charged to your hotel account. -When we walked into our room it looked like a furniture warehouse with beds and whatever wasn\u2019t permanently mounted to the wall all over on one side and in the adjacent corner of the room. Housekeeping was good enough to find a man to arrange the furniture properly. I suspect maybe they had a rollaway or two in there prior to our occupancy. It's the only explanation I could come up with for the mess in the lay out. -Toilet is in a separate little room but the only access to it is through the bath/shower room. -Inadequate light for reading in the rooms. -Elevators can be hard to find and don\u2019t necessarily go where you want to go. -Restaurants are scattered around the periphery of the casino. The food court is the one you have to walk farthest to get to. -The Grand Caf\u00e9 - We almost had to trip someone to get our order taken and it took a full 30 minutes to get our breakfasts after ordering. The restaurant filled up while we were there because people were waiting so long for their food to be delivered. Food was kinda warm but not hot when it arrived. Quality of the food was low average to not very good. (A friend told me the buffet restaurant was good!) -Awkward layout of the casino, hidden elevators, and grossly wasted space in the hotel wing led us to suspected the architect had never graduated from architect\u2019s school.

It is worth travelling the 15 miles or so off the strip unless you've never been to Las Vegas before. Red Rock is best described as a large, hip W meets Frank Lloyd Wright. The attention to detail and design quality is really asonishing if you appreciate that sort of thing. It's ultra cool, but at the same time, ultra laid back. One trip here, and you'll kiss the strip goodbye forever. The casino is seperated from the hotel, so you don't have to aimlessly wander through the casino to get to the hotel. I prefer the Canyon view over the Strip view for room choices. The view of the Red Rock Canyon is breatakingly beautiful. I stay here on business 2-3 times a year, but also come back for quick getaways with the wife and kids. The Kids Quest I think it's called is awesome... your little ones won't want to leave... You can drop them off for up to 6 hours and when you come back they STILL don't want to leave! Just remember to call them in advance if bringing your kids!! They require up to date immunization records which you can fax over in advance. Red Rock Canyon is literally right across the highway, only a few miles away. This is a really neat experience, whether you want to drive or hike it. The only thing that Station Casinos (Red Rock) is somewhat bad at, is communication. For comps, general questions, you name it, it takes FOREVER to get an answer. Calls are transferred around, front desk refers you to someone else...

They pried out the door panel, pried open the trunk, and still not getting inside, cut (twice) the convertible top.

My caution to others is in how Station Casinos responded. They took a written report. No apologies (even for the inconvenience), no follow-up written or telephone contact. Essentially, it was \"too bad, now leave\". I didn't expect (nor did I ask) that they pay for damage, but some expression of concern would have gone a long way. Clearly, the person doing the burglaring had some heavy-duty tools with them - I'm glad I didn't return to the call sooner and interrupt their violence, or Red Rock could instead to ignoring my medical needs rather than just my vehicle damage.

I stated that I was a family member, and I was the only member arriving on Thursday night. This event was planned approximately 2 months in advance. Common-in sense should have played a role in this conversation, i.e., I was part of the event. Needless to say I/we had no choice but to stay for the night and was assured that they would adjust my room charges to the group rate the following day (Friday). Following directions I went to the Hotel desk the next morning only to find out that the Clerk/Reservationist could not make the adjustment, it could only be handled by the person who reserved/booked the rooms (Mara). The Clerk/Reservationist stated that she would email her to phone our party who reserved the rooms. The phone call never came. We had to call her. Sunday, finally we tried again and was told that she spoke to the hotel manager and he said \"No\" this was not going happen, I would not be receiving the group rate, even though that was not what I was told. But, they would adjust/remove the \"resort\" fee. By this time I'm not sure I believe anything this hotel is saying or doing. I go down stairs so that I can speak to Mara directly. Wouldn't you know she would not come out to talk to me, I had just spoke to her, and it was obvious to me by the expression on the gentlemen's face who had went in to call her to the desk that she was there. Unfortunately for our group we had spent collectively over $4000.00 in this casino, meals, gambling, shopping, etc. during our entire stay. Oh, I don't want to forget the meal we had at the Grille Cafe after checking-in on Thursday night. Upon entering I noticed a man sitting on a bar stool on the back wall, but paid it no mine at the time. We were seated right away. We waited, and waited, and waited. Thirty minutes had passed, no water, only in passing \"some one will be right with you\". My daughter saw the waiter pass our area again and summoned him to our table and asked was someone going to wait on the two of us? He responded in haste that he was sorry (mind you every one around us was being waited on) that he was getting off work now and that they were trying to find someone to help us! Trying to find someone, are you kidding me? He did not seem embarassed that we stopped him but it appeared that he did not want to wait on our table. About 5 - 10 minutes later another waiter comes to the table to take our order. Now by this time (45 minutes later) I am frustrated with a loss of appetite. He takes our order. While waiting again I noticed a group of five people walking in to be seated three tables ahead of my table by the man I saw sitting on stool when we entered the restaurant. He seated them right away. I said to my daughter I wonder how long they're going to have to wait to eat. No sooner than I said this (less than 2 minutes) a waiter was at their table with his pad and pencil writing. Amazing. Meanwhile, we've been sitting close to an hour now and the waiter that was leaving to go home was still serving food. Imagine that! Wow! Unfortunately, I could not get the word to our group to not patronize this restaurant until after the fact and they experienced the same thing. I'am a working professional. I 've owned 2 small businesses, and 1 restaurant. I treat all customers the same regardless of race, gender, creed, or color. If you are only serving a certain race/group of people then you should post a sign outside your restaurant stating that fact. That way guest arriving will know not to stop. If your staffing per customer ratio is low then you can relay this to your customer upon their arrival, i.e., the wait time may exceed 5 or 10 minutes, etc. Never again! You can keep your \"rock\". The shopping I did in your casino, especially the shirts we purchased with your insignia engraved on them, will be donated to the Goodwill Stores.

What I found most interesting, & most annoying, was the fact that cell service & aircard service, for the laptop, were essentially non-existent as soon as one turned down the hall towards the guestrooms. Service for both was fine in the convention center & lobby, but in the room, even standing right next to the window, nothing. I realize these casinos don't want guests in their rooms for any reason, but this is just silly, not to mention petty. They also charge an additional 'resort' fee, on top of the nightly room rate, which includes guest room internet, allegedly wired & wi-fi. I ended up having to use the wi-fi, because the wired wasn't connected, which also confirms my suspicions that they were using some kind of blocking device to ensure only their own signals got thru. Again, very petty. Beds in the room were a platform type, w/no box spring, making them very low to get in/out of. And, since they don't use fitted bottom sheets on the bed, the platforms made it a bit difficult to remake the bed each night to keep the bottom sheet from wadding up. Bathroom was large & lovely, but not a single bit of ventilation in it. Considering the lone AC vent for the room itself was completely opposite of the bathroom, it would be quite steamy in there very quickly. Interestingly, this is the same set up as the Bellagio making me think they had the same designers! AC in the room also has a motion sensor that will turn the air flow off when no movement is detected; this made it difficult to really get the room cooled off or stay cool at night. As far as dining options go, we ate at the Grand Cafe, LBS, & the Salt Lick BBQ. Definately recommend the sweet potato fries @ LBS along w/the fried chicken & blackberry cobbler @ Salt Lick. Would I recommend this hotel to others? Depends on your reason for going. If you are simply going to gamble & sit by the pool, go for it. However, if your trip includes business for which you will need your cell or laptop, I'd suggest a non-gaming hotel, of which there are plenty, in the Vegas area instead (I've also made the same recommendation to the conference organizers).", "Date": "August 26, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Germany", "Title": "\u201cThat Place Rocks\u201d", "Author": "TravelcookieGermany", "ReviewID": "UR38804511", "Content": "We spent three nights at the Red Rock Casino & Resort in July 2008 and found this a really fun place!

She said she was told by the front desk that I had already left. I'm glad I answered the door when I did, or I have a feeling she would have walked on in. They like to make sure your awake early at Red Rock I guess. There was no sign to have them make your bed, they just don't. After 4 nights it might have been nice to have been offered linen changes - even though I probably wouldn't (to conserve water). When I made my reservation I told them that I was making it two months in advance so I didn't end up at the far end of the hotel from my conference. That didn't work either. Although they did offer to let me wait around until someone else left. I contacted the front desk 4 times, once by phone and 3 times in person with concerns. Apparently they didn't care because when I made them aware of the problems again at checkout, they said they didn't have any records of my concerns. I have been told twice since then that they are looking into concerns but need to \"investigate\". Didn't know a crime took place, just wanted good service. You may just want to save money and go the Days Inn. This is the 4th resort we've stayed at in Vegas and we loved all the others. Not a relaxing place but if your planning on being drunk the whole time, then may be OK. Also, don't plan to relax by the pool after 7:00pm, it closes early and your not even allowed to sit on the chairs and relax.

We had 4 families all traveling from afar to stay at the Red Rock. My sister arrived first and secured her room and my parents' room. An hour later, my brother and I showed up with our families. We were told that they overbooked and had to move us to a Marriott \"just down the road\" that was suppose to be of \"equal caliber\" as the Red Rock. We saw them tell other bewildered families the same story. Red Rock's management was vague about why we were being moved, but what I pieced together is a large convention was coming in and they were giving away our rooms to conventioneers. They even said that they didn't know of the \"problem\" until this week, and admitted that we place our reservation well in advance of the convention being booked. But, the conventioneers came first in their eyes. They couldn't tell us why they didn't contact us prior to our arrival to let us know of this problem, to allow us to find other accommodations. So, my brother and I went to the Marriott. It was NOT right down the road. It took 15 minutes to get there from the Red Rock. It was NOT EVEN CLOSE to being at the same luxury level as the Red Rock. It's like comparing a 5 star hotel to a 3 star. It was filled with an over-70 crowd. It was horrible. Our family reunion was ruined, as two families were in a different hotel than the other two. Our kids were heartbroken. So, if you want to take your chances and book this hotel, I hope they honor your reservation but you might not want to take the chance and instead head out to a luxury hotel on the strip.

The lobby, the casino, the restaurants, the rooms were all very upscale. The staff members we dealt with, especially the parking valets and the pool people, were friendly and seemed to genuinely care about whether or not we were enjoying ourselves or needed anything. We like the location away from the Strip because we like to fly to Vegas and rent a fun car like a Mustang convertible, so driving to and from the resort is no problem, and then we can also drive around in Red Rock Canyon which is beautiful. Who needs to be on the Strip (especially if you've \"Been there/Done that\") when you can have views of Red Rock Canyon? Also, there is almost no smell of cigarette smoke in this resort. The only time we smelled cigarettes was when we were in the casino and were right next to a smoker, and then we could just quietly walk away. (By contrast, on a previous trip last month, we stayed in a condo, and we went into the Tropicana to eat a quick bite, and we were literally blown away by the disgusting smoky smells at that old hotel - from the minute we walked in the door, throughout the entire casino, and in the restaurant. Our clothes and hair reeked after we left the Tropicana, and I doubt we will ever go back in there again!) The Red Rock must have more modern air exchangers, because the air was truly fresh, everywhere we went in there. The backyard is what they call the pools area, and it was also spectacular. You can tell from the photos on this website that they don't have any of the traditional old-timey lounge chairs around the pools. Instead there are these really comfortable single and double beds. Some are round, and others are in the shallow water at the edge of the main pool. There are many pools and an interesting fountain. We had booked a package called Party at the Pool, not something I would have chosen ordinarily, but I happened on it on their website, and found that we would actually save significant money on our room and as a free bonus have some fun at the pool with a ca-bed, some snacks, and liquor thrown in. The room in the package is a signature suite which is very very nice. It has a living room area, bedroom, and two bathrooms, one of which is a toilet and vanity, and the other is a full bathroom larger than some hotel rooms I've seen. Everything in the suite was first class from the three televisions to the linens and bed, to the toiletries. The sound proofing was excellent and we heard no noises from the hallways or footfalls from rooms above us. When I booked this package, I had no idea what the ca-bed is or what bottle service at the pool means, but the cost of the suite went down and the rest of the package was thrown in, so it was a no-brainer! Here's what it turned out to be: The ca-bed is a little upgrade at the pool. It is not a traditional cabana which is much much nicer, but very expensive. The ca-bed is like a canopy structure around the lounging bed. It has canvas curtains on the sides that you can untie for privacy, I guess, but no cover on the top of the canopy to shade you from the sun. I do not think I would have found the ca-bed to be worth its cost separately from the package, but, by booking the package, as I said, we got the ca-bed, chips and salsa, bottle service, and the suite for much less money, so yeah the package was a great deal. By the way bottle service means that the server at the pool brings you a bottle of your choice of a premium liquor and whatever mixers you want, plus lime slices, cups, and ice buckets. Things were looking pretty good to us after that!!! The food we ordered at the pool was excellent, by the way. We got some appetizers like chicken satay skewers and coconut shrimp, all with different dipping sauces. Later, my husband also got some hot dog sliders which he loved. Do not leave any of your food when you get up to dip in the pool as the crows are always watching for any opportunity to move in for a feast! The bad: The only problems we had on this trip were with the suite. It took them three tries to get it right. At first we were sent up to a suite with a view of the backyard and mountains that still had the previous guests' luggage in it! This was a new experience for us. It was really a shock to open the door (yes, our keys worked) and find someone else's luggage standing inside the door as if the people were maybe waiting to move to a different suite. We called out, but there was no one inside, just luggage. It was about 3 p.m., too late for them to be waiting to check out (check out time is noon), so the only thing I can think of is that they were waiting for a better room to be ready. We beat a hasty retreat back to the lobby, and they were as surprised as we were by the luggage in the room. They couldn't find us another equivalent suite and told us we may have to wait a while for one to be cleaned. At this point we were getting pretty frazzled, and when they wanted to give us a suite on a floor designated as a smoking floor (I think there are two of those floors), we asked if we could just have an upgrade (no) or a break on the price. The clerk offered us $50 food credit for being on a smoking floor, but my husband was not happy about having to do that. The clerk went to talk to a manager, and after about 10 minutes came back having \"found\" another suite for us. When we got up there, oh my gosh it was horrible! I think they had taken it out of service and that is why it didn't show on the clerk's computer. The minute we walked in we could hear the water pipes rumbling like a locomotive. The sound varied from a drumming sound to a very loud chugging. If you turned on the water, it stopped. My husband was getting cranky and looked at me like I was crazy when I asked him if he wanted to go back down to the lobby and try for yet another room. Since the sound was mainly in the living room, that night we just closed the bedroom door, and we could barely hear it unless it was in its chugging phase. At about 2 a.m., he yelled to me over the chugging sound, \"Let's call the desk in the morning and ask if there is another room!\" Two other problems with the room were that it was on the 4th floor, \"Strip view\" side, and actually gave a view of a parking garage and the side of a building. It was depressing, especially since the windows were totally coated with grime. When I called down, they apologized and found us another room which was to be ready between 1 and 3 p.m. It wasn't ready at 1 or at 3. After 4, they finally had a room for us, and it was spectacular. It was on the 8th floor and had a view of the backyard and those beautiful mountains we had come there for! Clear windows! No noise from the pipes! Hooray!!!!! Bottome line: I do not hold it against them that they had to try three times to get us a decent room, and I will definitely go back there again! The food at the pool was the best. The buffet was really good as was the cafe. As another Trip Advisor reveiwer noted, the beers you can order brought to you within the buffet were the best price, so thanks for that great tip! By the way, we had a ball gambling at the Red Rock. Although we've been to Vegas many times, our most recent gambling had been at some of the Indian casinos like Pechanga and Pala where the slots odds do not seem to be good at all. But at the Red Rock, we got many many smaller payouts all the time which made it lots of fun, and we got one or two nice bigger payouts so we didn't feel like total idiots. All in all I'm sure we left a little more money in their machines than they gave back to us, but it seemed like the slots were looser there, and it was much more fun hearing all the bells and whistles going off all the time. All in all, I highly recommend the Red Rock. It was well worth the money, especially since we found that special on their website that brought the cost down and the fun way way up.", "Date": "June 6, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Norwalk, Connecticut", "Title": "\u201cNot exactly Vegas\u201d", "Author": "keirao", "ReviewID": "UR31409665", "Content": "This being my 12 trip to Vegas, I wanted to try out a new hotel (as I usually try to do each time) I will keep this brief...

The only way to describe the pool is odd. Although it looks very pretty, there are limited umbrellas (as in all of Vegas) and the first row of chairs is immersed in water so there is really no place to put your stuff unless you grab a mini table. Even still the tables are tiny, so my friend and I had quite a few things fall into the pool throughout our stay. LOTS of families and kids (which is fine if that is what you want) Music was great for one day while we were there. The second day they were preparing for a concert so music was shut off and we listened to sound checks all afternoon at top volume. The following day \"Cherry\" the topless pool/bar area had their own music which wasnb't really loud enough to hear, but obviously loud enough for them to not put on their music. Because of the things falling off tables into the water, there were quite a few floating cups and bottles in pool which just made it look disgusting. Food was good. We ate at Terra Rosa (which was okay) and TBones (which was also okay) There was NO stanbd out service at all here, and the steak looked like about half the size of one I would get in NYC for the same price. Although prices were pretty reasonable. The bartender in the lobby bar was the one exception to stand out service. He made the best chocolate martinis and balanced us all night with fresh water so we wouldn't get drunk! Food at the outdoor/pool restaurant was surprisingly good and service was pretty fast. Spa OUTSTANDING. best massage and facial and facilities were very very nice. They do tack on a 20% gratuity automatically, but they ask if you would like to adjust it at the end of the service. I left the 20%. My bill was close to $500 for two treatments, so be prepared to buck up. Casino Most tables were $10 minimum and they had pretty much every game. I only played blackjack and craps. Dealers were pretty friendly. Overall I would NOT recommend this hotel if you have never been to Vegas. Stay somewhere on the strip.

We rented a car and went hiking in the Red Rock National Park, which is lovely and well worth spending a day exploring. We drove to the strip one day and walked around. The pool at the resort was beautiful, but we never had time to go swimming. We only stayed two nights, so we didn't get to do all that is available at the resort. I highly recommend the LBS restaurant---the hamburgers and salads are delicious! Also, be sure to try the Grand Cafe---luscious desserts and superb sandwiches---also a very good breakfast. You can get a dessert and cup of milk to take to your room for a late night treat there. We ate at the Feast Buffet only once and found that the alcohol is MUCH cheaper there than anywhere else in the resort---2 dollar beers---that's a bargain, and the food and service were good. The only drawback is the waiting in line---but the price is worth the wait. As in other reviews, it is true that the mini-bar in the room is way overpriced and you get charged if you even move anything in it---so we did not touch it! Also, the bars in the casino can get quite smoky---for non-smokers this is a drawback. We liked sitting at the bars playing the slots, but as soon as a smoker sat by us, we left and went to the non-smoking part of the casino. As for the room, it was perfect! The bathtub is HUGE---you could almost swim laps in it! And the toiletries are very good quality. The robes are a nice touch, too. Also, we discovered that there is a \"Do Not Disturb\" button that you can push that is right next to the door---it is easy to overlook, and if you don't use it, the maids will knock on your door constantly in the morning to check and see if you are ready to have your room cleaned. I didn't see the button until our second night. The only thing about the room I didn't like is that it is pretty dark---there are no lights in the center of the room. Other than that, the bed is heavenly and the view is amazing (we were on the canyon side). My husband and I have traveled all over the world and rarely go back to the same place twice, but we want to go back to the Red Rock and stay for a week, rent a car, and visit all the national parks nearby. We are already planning to return during Thanksgiving week next year.

I booked it on Hotwire (they don't tell you the hotel until after you confirm payment) and got a great deal (choose a 4-star west of the strip and this is probably the hotel you will get; got the room for $65 plus the resosrt fee). From the airport, if you are lucky you will catch the free shuttle to the hotel but if not, a cab can run $60+ (it will vary on the driver and the route). Go to the other side of the terminal and you can get a Town Car for $66 (fixed rate). There is also no line usually for the Town Car/Limo area while the cab line can be long. It is about a 30-40 minute drive to the hotel from the airport but it could take longer during rush hour. The check-in was easy and quick and I was off to my room in no time. The room was great. Clean and well designed with a very comfortable bed and a 42\" plasma on the wall (no HD channels). The room reminded me of The Hotel at Mandalay Bay but without the living room (hopefully that makes some sense). I had a view of the pool which looked awesome but I didn't get to it on this trip. The bathroom in the room is well appointed with a soaking tub with LCD TV mounted on the wall at the foot of the tub. The separate shower is nice but no rain head as I thought I saw in some other reviews. (The head is a little higher on the wall so for some, this may have appeared to be a rain head but I am on the taller side so no such luck for me.) There are a bunch of restaurants but I only tried two of them. Since the Mets were playing and I wanted to catch the game, I got a burger from their food court (Fatburger-what an unfortunate if not accurate name). It was tasty. Also I had breakfast at the buffet. One tip-get their player's club card and you get a dollar off the price but only if you also set up a pin number first. Do this at the player's club area. No pin number, no discount. The casino workers were friendly and there were plenty of tables available. I played craps and they had $10 min at night and $5 min during the day. (Typical 3x4x5x odds) Overall, the entire place was really attractive and without the nuttiness of the strip. I will definitely stay here again. (The free shuttle back to the airport is a lot easier to get since it runs on a consistent schedule but get in line 10 or so minutes before it leaves otherwise it may fill up. They do have a couple of cars there to take you to the airport for $55 fixed rate according to the bell man I spoke with.)", "Date": "May 13, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cWatch out for the hidden fee\u201d", "Author": "dennisfr", "ReviewID": "UR29048390", "Content": "As other reviewers have mentioned, there is a $27 \"resort fee,\" which supposedly covers airport shuttle service (whether or not you use it), the fitness room (whether or not you use it -- and of course fitness rooms are generally free), etc. When I checked out, I told the young lady at the desk that this meant the room was actually $217, rather than the $190 I had agreed to when I made my reservation on the internet, and she politely agreed.

Secluded private 'spa only' pools, hot tubs, cabanas, etc etc... ***Poolside cabanas 200/day weekdays 350/day fri-sat-sun. 32\" plasma tv, couches, mister, ceiling fan, spekers, private changing room in cabana, dedicated wait staff, complimentary unlimited water, red bull, naked juice (4 flavors), sparkling water, fruit platter, nuts, and salsa/chips. Poolside bar a little expensive, but not over the top. $15 burger, $12 margarita. ***King signature suites are about 1000/sq feet. 2 42\" plasmas, bose clock-radio with supplied iPod hookup cable, 1 and 1/2 bath, 4 phones, complimentary shoe-shine service (i got mine done twice!), wet bar, 2 fridges, really comfy beds. HUGE whirlpool tub, plasma in the bathroom, separate water closet in master bathroom, room safe was oversized and in the wall so it didn't take up 1/2 the closet, very clean. ***LBS burger joint was great ($30 for 2 people incl. tip - not bad for lunch - average) ***Diner 'Grand Cafe' was good and super cheap ($20 for 2 people incl. tip for lunch) ***Starbucks on site open 24/7 right outside of casino ***TONS of non-smoking sections within the casino ***There's a CVS/Supermarkey nearby which is definitely 'walkable' if you're in halfway decent shape if you need some incidentals, or would like to stock the spare fridge with some stuff. ***Bingo Hall had secluded smoking section. (Yes, we're 30 and tried playing bingo hahaha) - very fun ***Staff was super helpful and friendly. They have \"A3 Service\" which stands for \"anything, anytime, anywhere\" - basically you call down and if you want cocoa puffs with a pair of Adidas at 3am - they'll get it for you. Didn't test it out, but seems like it would be nice to have in an emergency. ***Overall clientele was on the 'clean-cut' side. Not being a snob, but you know what I mean... not too much trailer trash and/or hood-rats. ***Town Car Drivers from BLS Limo out front were great. Even offered free line cut passes to us for Ghost Bar and Excess for nothing. I'm not a club person so I didn't take them up on it. Either way a nice gesture. Cons: ***Free \"Shuttle\" to the strip only runs a few times a day, and is first come-first serve, and only runs until 10pm. (lets face it ... do they really want you spending your money at other casinos?) We took it once, and it only drops you off at the fashion show mall which is all the way at the northern-most end of the strip. It was crowded and hot. The rest of the time we took a town car to the strip at $55/trip....Probably spend a good $300-400 just on transportation to and from the strip for the 4 days/3 nights we were there... Then again, if you're looking to save $$, stay in old vegas. ***Free Internet is only available in the rooms, while all public areas are billed at $9.99 for every two hours.... ***Shower wasn't as hot as I liked it - but not everyone likes a super hot shower, so this may not be a 'con' to everyone Hope this helps you plan your trip.

First, the hotel is new, and all decorated in a post-modern style in dark brown, red and lime green. The rooms are spacious enough for a family of 4 not to feel cramped. There are no coffee/tea making facilities in the room, and the mini bar is packed. They have a 45 second mini bar rule...if anything is moved in the mini bar for longer than 45 seconds: it's yours! Unlike many hotels, you do not have the option of empyting your mini fridge. Views: one side is the Red Rocks canyon (a few miles away) and the pool; the other side is the Strip (about 10 miles away) and some very empty, open dirt spaces for construction that has come to a screeching halt. The canyon side is great if you are going to be in your room a lot during the day; the Strip side obviously for night time. Elevators: There are about 60 rooms on each floor. The rooms are numbered this way: You have your floor number, followed by 1, then your number, with the number closest to the elevator being 01, and the furtherest being 60. So, if you were on floor 17 and had room number 49 (49 rooms from the elevator!), your room number would be 17149. There is only one elevator from the lobby, and as many have commented, it is a loooooong walk to those rooms with the high numbers. I would try and ask for a room number lower than 30. There is a second elevator in the middle of the hallway, around room 30, but that only goes out to the pool area. If you think you're going to spend a lot of time going back and forth to the pool, the rooms around 30 would be great. There are a lot of family friendly activities possible on-site. There is a movie theatre, and a bowling alley. Monday has $1 games, and there is a family bowling package available for a family of four: 2 hours and 4 shoe rentals for $40. There is day care center for kids up to age 12, with things like Wii and Xbox games, but we were told you needed vaccination records to check your kid in. Since that's not really high on my packing list, we didn't inquire further. Next to the day care center is an arcade area with all the usual Chuck E. Cheese/Lazer Star games. However, never forget that the reason this hotel exists is to keep people gambling. The pool closes at 6 pm, and there's a sign saying that no kids are allowed to be unaccompanied in the hotel past 7 pm. There were a lot of kids in the pool when we were there (it was Spring Break); if you want a serene getaway, the spa has it's own lap pool. The spa is available for free (well, there's the daily resort fee) to all guests and is a wonderful place for guests 18 and older. You have the exercise room, outdoor lap pool and cabana area. In separate men/women's sections you have a hot tub, rain shower, dry and steam saunas and full shower facilities. Tea, fruit and water free to guests. Towels and robes provided. A great place to hide from the kids for an hour! Food: The Feast Buffet is great for families. If you sign up for their hotel 'Boarding Pass' card, breakfast is only $6.99. Check out the daily newspaper that gets delivered to your room. While we were there, page 2 of the paper always had a 'buy 1/get 1 free' coupon to the Feast Buffet. If you are a guest in the hotel, you may enter from the right side, rather than standing in the normally very long line on the left side. On the hotel website, I signed up for their 'dinner and a movie' package, but when we checked in at the hotel, we were allowed to convert all that credit into just a food credit, which was great, since we never did end up seeing any movies while we were there. And last, I can't emphasize enough that when you stay at this hotel, you are a LONG way away from Las Vegas, and technically you are in Summerlin, not LV. There is a definite feeling of being in the middle of nowhere (although you do have shopping centers right across the street). We liked that quiet and the isolation (as well as the proximity to Red Rocks Canyon - a definite recommend). However, if you are coming to Las Vegas for fun and action on The Strip, this is NOT, NOT, NOT the place to be. Oh, and if you are driving, GoogleMaps has you getting off at Sahara. The better exit is Charleston, which exits right in front of the hotel.", "Date": "April 17, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Iowa", "Title": "\u201cGreat time.\u201d", "Author": "padddie333", "ReviewID": "UR28041714", "Content": "The wife & I have been coming out to Las Vegas for 20 years now at least once a year. After all of these years we are able to get our rooms and meals comped to us at about seven different casinos. At most of these casinos we have a casino host which is very helpful. This year we decided to try a couple of sites we haven't been to before. We choose Red Rock for the first four days and New York New York for the last three days. We went thru a casino host at both properties. We were not scheduled to arrive in Las Vegas till 10:30 pm, so we basically figured the 1st night at Red Rock would be sort of wasted, because we still had to get a rental car after we got out of the airport. Our hosst arragned for a limo for us at the airport which saved us a lot of time and hassle. If you have never done this before I strongly suggest it. It was no time and we were out of the airport and we felt like a million bucks. The next day we took the hotel shuttle down to the airport and then got on the rental car agency shuttle bus with no problems. You can also rent cars right at Red Rock. The wife and I are both slot players and consider ourselves to be in the mid range of gambling level. We bring about $10,000 out with us and if we lose it we lose it. Red Rock had a large variety of slot machines to choose from. Including all the machines we like.From pennies to dollars we found the machines fairly loose. I won 2 hand paid jackpots and the wife came out about even. The food and service was good at the restaurants and the cocktail waitress were better than most casinos we've been too. If you just want something light to eat I strongly suggest the Garden Cafe. The food was better there and you didn't have to wait in any lines like at the buffet which we weren't impressed with. Our room was great especially the soaking tub and the bed and pillows. We didn't have a view because we were on the 3rd floor, but we were close to the elevator and views are not that important to us anymore. We get suites at the other properties we stay at, so when we say the rooms were nice, we mean it. The only complaint we really have about Red Rock was the kids. I've never seen so many kids running around in a casino. The pool which is really nice was packed with little kids everywhere you went. Go out to the pool at 10:30 am if you want a good spot. We had water splashed on our camera and cell phone the second day we were at the pool by 3 kids out of control. Their mother finally came over and told them their behavior was unexceptable. I'm 53 and never heard that before. They just laughed at her and kept it up. Overall I'd have to say our stay at Red Rock was excellent. It was nice to be away from the hassles of the strip. Our last three days we stayed at New York New York, check in was great going thru the VIP lounge and they put us in a nice marquis suite. The gambling wasn't nearly as nice as Red Rock and neither was the food and service. Parking and driving there was bad. You can only get into valet from one direction. Driving on the strip was impossible. We did have a good host who comped us all of our meals. Make sure you put your meals on your room so you can get comped at the end of your stay. The one thing nice about New York New York is that there is lots of places to walk to from there. All things considered for people our age who have been coming out to Las Vegas for awhile, I strongly suggest going to Red Rock and give it a try.

It is a very nice hotel, but the service and attitude are quickly going down the toilet. I suspect they have new management that is being very short sited. For example, if you buy a cigar in the gift shop they will not have matches, because they want you to buy a lighter instead. It is okay if you buy a $15 dollar cigar but they can't give you ( or even sell you ) a pack of matches. If you go down to Starbucks for a coffee in the morning and do not have photo ID a nasty girl who has been taking cranky pills will send you back to your room without a coffee. It can be a long to your room and back again for a $2.00 coffee. This gives you plenty of time to get your blood boiling. But then again I am sure they get a lot of con artists with a room key (that they know the billing details for) trying to scam a coffee at 6:45 a.m. In my case I was on my way back from the spa wearing a Red Rock housecoat, so for sure that would be strong indication that I was not a guest of the hotel and must have just walked in off the street to try to scam a coffee. My room had lights burned out and a pile of what looked like dog food crumbs by the bed when we arrived. The lights got fixed after I complained but the dirt on the floor took three days to finally be cleaned. Every day was a mystery as to what would and would not be cleaned. In a week, the ice bucket only was cleaned twice and the glass wear was a complete crap shoot. I read one of the previous reviews saying the internet is free. Well actually they charge a $25.00 resort fee in addition to your room rate so it is not free. They had a promo that included a free buffet, but this was billed to your room and would only be removed if you requested it on checkout.

The property is less than three years old and still looks brand new. The rooms are very comfortable with a unique contemporary style. The beds are \"way\" comfortable, the marble & chrome bathrooms are large -- with a deep soaker tub that has a flat screen TV on the wall for bath viewing. The large plasma TV in the room is nice but there isn't any HD programming, so it's a waste. The little fridge is packed with overpriced items and has no room for anything you want to put in. If an item is lifted for more than 45 seconds it is charged to your account, so be careful. Same goes for the snack items on the dresser. Our room was on the 19th floor facing Red Rock Canyon, and the view was ok. I requested a strip view room, but none were available. Keep in mind that the higher the room number the farther the room is from the elevator. If your room is above 20, it's a loooong walk. Buffet fair is good and the 24-hour cafe is convenient for all meals, snacks and morning coffee. There are two Starbucks for those who like burnt coffee.

I didn't really want to be on the Strip so we chose Red Rock. The hotel and surrounding snow covered mountains were beautiful. I loved the location. Every staff member that we encountered was pleasant and knowledgeable, many going out of their way to assist. The kids absolutely loved the TV over the bath tub (an added perk--they actually begged to take baths). The restaurants in the Hotel are overpriced but we expected that. The first night we chose LBS, a gourmet burger restaurant and after we got over the initial shock of a $16 burger we really enjoyed the meal. I ordered a veggie burger and I honestly have to say that it was definitely the best one I have ever had (and being a vegetarian I order them often and am usually disappointed). The next night we discovered several mid-range chain restaurants within walking distance of the Hotel. The only negative comments that I have were with the cleanliness of the room (as the last person commented), the icy pool and the honor bar. When we got to our room I noticed that in the bathroom, along the wall near the toilets had not been cleaned. There was dirt and hair that needed to be removed. We are used to having a coffee maker and refrigerator in rooms when we travel. The room had a refrigerator but it was full of overpriced honor bar drinks with no extra room. Also, on the low dresser were several cartons of snacks, etc. that were displayed in the open in plain sight. We were warned by the front desk that if these were moved we would be billed ($10 for what looked to be a 100 calorie pack of chocolate chip cookies etc.). Throughout the stay I was concerned that one of the kids would lie something on this display, knocking over the carton causing us to be billed. Not a good idea Red Rock! Put the things in a cabinet, please. Last on my list is the pool. We were told that the pool was open during the day. We were NOT told that it was not heated. The pool area is lovely and there are several pools and hot tubs. Unfortunately, only one small (12 person?) hot tub was heated. Needless to say it was the \"kiddie pool\" as like us, other parents had promised pool time for the kids. The kids were very disappointed as the main, unheated pool was even too cold for them! Next time, please warn us ahead of time that the pool is open but unheated!

We had passed this hotel last time we were in Vegas on our way out to Red Rock and thought it looked pretty cool and the location was very convenient to the park. Since we were planning on doing some hiking in Red Rock it was a no brainer to stay there. The Good -The rooms are fantastic! I couldn't believe the size of our standard king room. It was clean and tastefully decorated. I know others have complained of the Strip view being too far away but I loved it at night. The lights were just mesmerizing. We actually spent our last night drinking champagne and just staring out the floor to ceiling windows at the twinkling valley. -The location was perfect for what we were looking for. If you want to be close to the strip this is definitely not the hotel for you. It's about a 10 minute drive into Red Rock Canyon which is a must do if you stay at this hotel. The place is just gorgeous! There is a variety of hiking options for all skill levels. We did the turtlehead peak hike which was awesome but not for the inexperienced. If hiking isn't your bag, the 13 mile scenic drive is well worth the $5 entry fee. There are plenty of stores near by which was great for picking up little necessities at non-hotel prices. -When we weren't playing in the park, we were eating/drinking/gambling. We ate at the Grand Cafe, Cabos, and LBS. All meals were good- reasonably priced and the service was exceptional. Everyone, and I do mean everyone, went out of their way to provide friendly and prompt service. I really can't say enough about how friendly and courteous the staff was. The casino is very nice and well ventilated. We actually were able to get cocktail service at regular intervals while playing! There are plenty of cheap machines to drain your wallet at a slow pace. If drinking and gambling don't make you happy there's bowling, a movie theater, and an arcade. The Bad -Elevator layout. We had the first room off the elevator so we never had to experience the full walk but just for fun I did it just to see how far it was. It is a very, very, very long walk. I don't understand why a hotel of this level couldn't put an elevator in at the other end of the loop. I really feel for those who have to lug all their stuff down to the other end. Even if you pack light and are in good shape it would still be a major pain. -Noise Level. Being close to the elevator had it's downside. You could hear every word of every conversation in the hallway. The people weren't even being loud. The walls are just paper thin. What's even weirder is that the room is actually set back aways from the main hallway! I've had better sound proofing in an Econo Lodge. Again, this seems to be a major design flaw like the elevators. -The Resort Fee. Something really bothers me about having to pay another bill for services I don't even use after I've already \"paid\" for my stay. I don't understand why they don't just put it into the price of the hotel. I know it's only another 25/night but it just makes you feel like you're being nickled and dimed. The Bottom Line I will definitely stay here again but it will be more for it's proximity to Red Rock than the hotel itself. The hotel is very nice and the rates are decent but if all I wanted was luxury I would probably stick to the Bellagio.", "Date": "January 8, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Scottsdale, Arizona", "Title": "\u201cFourth time-much improved\u201d", "Author": "AZ-Traveler85253", "ReviewID": "UR23376730", "Content": "I took the family for our December trip to Vegas and gave Red Rock another chance because the kids love it there.

The service was so much better than our last trip there. All the casino dealers were wonderful, and the front desk, bell and outside staff were the usual stellar performers. The rooms were kept very clean and we enjoyed all the things there that the kids love; bowling, movies, Kid's Quest, and the arcade and food court. Sign up for poker is easy to do with your card, and hanging out in the sports room is very nice. The breakfast buffet was a hit with the kids, and really, the prices are very reasonable, except on Christmas morning, when it's $17. Coffee shop is a great substitute.

It was very close to the hotel-easy to go back and forth from. The second night we went to the strip. Driving to it was easy and we found free parking right away. Only two things annoyed me- 1. the free shuttle to the strip stops shuttling pretty early at night, so it is not something to take if you want a night out on the town. But if you have a car, it seemed easy to park on the strip so it worked out okay. 2. The casino owns everything, of course. So when I tried to be cheap and get breakfast from the Starbucks in the hotel with my gift card, I found out that the Starbucks does not take gift cards or Starbucks credit cards.

The rooms were sumptuous, and above average. The beds were heavenly, and I have stayed in numerous hotel beds. The bathroom was just as great. The huge, deep bathtub was a welcome retreat after a long day. The stand alone shower and separate toilet area was great as well. Be careful of the mini bar as it is a touch sensitive mini-bar, and if items are removed after 45 sec you will be charged. If you come with small children, be warned that they are just at child level.

It truly was awe inspiring to see the mountains every day. The lobby may not be as impressive as some of the strip hotels, it surely is welcoming, and the property is very family friendly as opposed to many of the strip properties. I would say that the hotel restaurants leave a bit to be desired. The burger place, LBS was okay, but as was our experience in all of the property sit-down restaurants, the service was painfully slow. There are a few restaurants, as well as a food court in the hotel. The sandwich place in the food court was one of the best experiences I had as far as food on property. As many of the other reviewers touched on, the property is a u-shaped property, with the elevator located in the center, so chances are your room will be a far haul from the lobby and elevator. There is another set of elevators but it only goes to the pool. The hotel shops also leave a bit to be desired, if you forget anything or would like a late night snack, i guess the hotel wants you to order room service, as the shop has very little to offer, besides over-priced clothing. There is a shuttle to the strip if you plan on heading down, make sure you pickup a schedule from the concerige desk. It runs limited hours, and a cab is about a $50 trip one way. The shuttle runs to the Fashion Mall, make sure if you are planning on using the shuttle you get clear specifications on where to catch the shuttle on the way back. They pick up on the lowest level of the mall, by the Gap. Helpful info as on the schedule it only says North Entrance, not marked very well in the actual mall.

First of all, I had read and heard that it is a very family friendly property, so I was eager to see what they had to offer. I am pregnant and we traveled with our preschool-age child. How it looks The rooms, hotel, casino, restaurants, and pool areas are spotless and modern, so no complaints there. Things were easy enough to navigate quickly. Check in was easy and set apart from the rest of the casino area which made for a more relaxing and quiet arrival and transition into the resort. There are two Starbucks and a foodcourt in addition to the buffets and restaurants. More on the layout later. Charges As another reviewer mentioned, there are quite a few extra charges or potentials for extra charges that irked us. The resort fee is daily and seems excessive. Why not work this into the room charge? Makes no sense! I know this is done more and more, but I will say, I don't like it one bit. Rooms First of all the views are spectacular- right to the red rocks. We were on the 9th floor. Loved waking up early every morning and seeing the mountains glow. As promised and mentioned by other reviewers, the beds are amazingly comfortable, pillows great, robes and slippers wonderful. I too considered purchasing them and taking them home (pricey though). Bathrooms are spacious and spotless, well stocked. Deep tub and there is a flat screen tv over it. Our daughter thought this was really cool. Unfortunately, there are about 10 different boxes of snack foods right at toddler reach level. If the boxes are removed for longer than 45 seconds, you are charged for them. I was constantly jockeying with my daughter and trying to explain that for the first day. I actually really appreciate snacks being available but there was absolutely nowhere to hide them once their existence was made known. I'd prefer them to be in a cabinet with the minibar as I've seen in other hotels. Or, since they knew we were traveling with a child, they could have been removed or put up high. So if this is the kind of thing that irks you, be sure to request their removal in advance. For what it's worth, the quality of snacks and goodies was pretty good- for adults and kids. Not just a bunch of snickers and cokes. On our second night there, we were interrupted not once but three times by the housekeeping staff trying to do turn-down service. Thought I made it clear the first time it wasn't needed. We had adjoining rooms, so the first time I answered the door, said no thank you. Then they came to the second door, and though I called out, \"no thank you, we're all set\" they used a card key and entered the room anyway, terrifying my daughter. Then the maid insisted on handing me chocolates which again, my daughter could not stop asking about (after she was already in bed with brushed teeth- argh). I conveniently noticed the fancy \"do not disturb\" light button by the doors- after she was finally asleep. This is picayune, but the cable channels weren't all that great for kids. I realize we're not there to watch tv but it is helpful. No PBS, just Nick and Disney. No kids movies available on their pay movie service, either. Odd. This is an easy fix and one I hope they make. Pool The pool area was lovely. Our group had pre-reserved cabanas which was nice, but they were a little far from the main pool area (but I didn't choose my cabana, so no fault on that). It took over an hour after we arrived for them to stock the fridges as promised. They were very kind about it, but we were literally told four times by the same two staff members that they were \"just about to take care of that\" and it didn't come until ages later, when we got a selection of one kind of juice and sodas. They were able to bring us some breakfast goodies, coffee, and other snacks later in the day (and the entire pool menu is available, of course). Cabanas in our area had no backs, so it did get a bit too windblown for us. The entire area is well laid out and there were plenty of chaises and cool bed/cabanas that were also reservable, but the all of the pools are completely cool and shaded until late morning. Maybe this is nicer during the prime heat of summer. But this time of year it was a bit chilly, so all the kids at the hotel congregated in the jacuzzi tubs, and once most of them had a taste of it, the bigger pools were just too cold even when the sun blazed on the pool. The biggest of the pools was absolutely perfect for small kids- major kudos on the design there. There is a wading area around the entire edge which is safer and a lot more fun for the pre-swimming set. And a fun waterfall right in the middle. Lots of chaise lounges that come right up to the edge of the pool, very convenient (and they're comfy, too). The pool area has a snackbar/cafe area, but we paid $18 for a virgin colada for mum and an icecream sandwich for our daughter. Um, wow. We did get three different flavors of ice cream- but one would have been fine. Sometimes simpler is better with a kid, eh? We got towels on the way in on both days, and both days they were scooped up by other folks. On the first day this actually happened twice, so we came out of the water shivering to find someone had taken them. Then upon requesting new ones, the pool staff had to go all the way back to the check-in area to grab new ones- but I noticed they first attended to some VIPs in a roped off area before attending to us. Maybe they need some towel stations located throughout the pool area instead of just at check-in. Or perhaps they just need to be absolutely sure everyone entering the pool area is well stocked with towels so people don't feel they can grab others? Room Service Always a nice thing when you have young children. $6 for a box of cereal. Can't order tea or coffee in-room without ordering an entire carafe. That means $8 for a cup of tea or coffee. I couldn't order a single cup, and no tea bags or coffee machine in the room. Sigh. Guess they want you to go down to Starbucks. However the menu was lengthy and did have child-friendly items on it. And the order process was smooth, delivery fast. Kids Activities The arcade was crowded but fun. Bowling alley- very neat place and something different for us in Vegas- we were surprised that even our 3 year old enjoyed herself there. We did not make use of the KidsQuest because apparently vaccination records were required- so if you plan to use this service, plan ahead. There's a movie theatre, too (Regal Cinemas). Food court has a good selection of different types of kid-friendly food (Italian, Ice Cream, Chinese, etc) though we had catered food through our group for the weekend (which was delicious and service was excellent). All of these child-friendly amenities are on the opposite end of the hotel area, so you'll have to cut through the casino smoke and chaos to get there. This walk got a little long, but I suppose that can't be changed. Bring a stroller. Spa Spa is lovely and I had one of the best treatments I've ever had. I usually get the same type of treatment whenever I use a hotel spa so I've had a good comparison. This was excellent. Check in and out was quick. The list of available services is extensive- from massage to salon services including manis and pedis, but no body waxing (why is this?), first time I've seen that glaring omission, especially at a nicer hotel. Service For us the most important thing at a hotel when traveling with kids is the service and respect you get as parents. This is especially true in Vegas which is primarily a playground for adults. Nobody wants to feel like a second-class citizen with kids there, and we have certainly felt that way at other casinos/resorts there. I have to say Red Rock did deliver excellent service in this respect 95% of the time. Every contact I had from check-in to check-out, bellmen to casino security to arcade staff to restaurant staff, always smiling and happy to make us happy. It was a very friendly, summer camp kind of atmosphere and that made me feel really taken care of the entire weekend. Moms and dads need pampering too and they made that possible. Will I be back? Probably yes. I think what I liked best about Red Rock was the feeling that I was being taken care of, despite a few very minor inconviences I can plan ahead/troubleshoot for next time. The staff really were friendly and at our beck and call. The beds were a dream and the rooms were intensely quiet. Loved the views. Though we didn't use their \"Adventure Spa\" the idea of a guided hike to a hot spring or kayaking was a wonderful idea and I'd love to take advantage of that aspect of Las Vegas. Red Rock is closer to these activities which makes me more apt to do them- plus they have gambling, a great pool and the wonderful spa. Pretty much everything you'd have on the strip, plus the outdoors activities, and a few extras for the kids.", "Date": "September 22, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto", "Title": "\u201cLove the Red Rock\u201d", "Author": "Urastar", "ReviewID": "UR19628262", "Content": "We first visited Las Vegas in 1994 and stayed at the Flamingo. This is when Vegas wasn't as glitzy as now and the food was extremely cheap ($1.99 turkey dinner) because they wanted you to gamble and it was pretty much an adult only playground back then. Boy has it changed. In August 2007 we went for the second time and went to the Red Rock and loved loved it. We really only heard about it because of the reality show Hells Kitchen and really wanted to meet the winner (which we didn't boo hoo...hehe). It was moderately priced compared to the strip's 5 stars and the pictures on the website were fantastic so we gave it a try and what can I say we just fell in complete love with this place. So we travelled there once again this year and our love for this place continues to grow. We always rent a car to do the whole Vegas strip thing but we always feel happy happy returning to our little oasis in the mountains. It's a great place to just chill out and relax. The pool area is more a disco with the loud music and there is tons of kids but there are a few quiet pools which if you are lucky the kids don't take over. We always found chairs and the chairs are extremely comfortable. And you never have to worry about towels. There are plenty and you can have as many as you want. The waitresses at the pool constantly come by which is great because you get really thirsty in Vegas in August. The room is great. Clean spacious and the bed is so very comfy. It's the only casino hotel I can actually sleep in. If they do pump oxygen in the air at the Red Rock it doesn't keep me or my husband from sleeping. And the curtains keep out the sun really well so you basically can sleep all day if you needed.. Lots of restaurants to choose from. You can eat fairly cheap or go all out and have a fabulous fine dining experience. We had a wonderful steak dinner at Tbone. Or you can opt for a burger at Fat burger or a pizza slice in the food court. And of course there is the buffet which is quite reasonably priced and the food isn't bad. And if you have a players card you get a discount. Last year we went to the Wynn because of the hype of the buffet. We waited in line for almost 2 hours and then you had to wait in line at all the stations so when you finally sat down to eat the food was cold and not worth the $50 per person price tag. My absolute favorite part of the Red Rock was the poker room. It's a great place to play. The dealers are actually quite sociable and you don't have to wait long to play. They have 1/2 no limit or higher stake games. There is no ante or hidden fees just the rake which we didn't even notice being from Canada and paying $6 every half hour at Niagara Falls. The Red Rock runs a very professional poker room compared to ours and I was really impressed at how many hands you could actually play in a half an our because the dealers are fast and sufficient. It was a complete pleasure to play there. One night we drove to the strip and figured we'd play at Belaggio because they say they are the best. But between the ante's and rakes and the rude pit boss we said see ya later and drove back to the Red Rock for a nice relaxing poker experience. Lastly this year we actually drove through Red Rock a couple of times and it was breathtaking. Just beautiful!!! We had suck a relaxing time in Vegas.

I had several issues with my hotel room and hidden charges: Room: The rooms were nice, but not $300/night nice. Additionally, the rooms have an electronic sensor on the snacks tray, so that if you lift up a package of nuts to examine it and it's off the tray for more than 45 seconds, you get charged for it. For Christ's sake! Does the hotel mistrust its supposedly upscale guests so much that it has to install electronic sensors to ensure that they don't steal the 45 cent package of nuts that the hotel has marked up to $9? Give me a break. This sort of behavior -- treating guests as if they were poorly behaved small children -- is ridiculous, and left a very bad taste in my mouth towards the hotel. And why are the pistachios marked up to $9, anyway? Isn't the hotel making enough money at $300/night, plus whatever guests spend in the casinos, bars, and restaurants, to cover its expenses without the ridiculously overpriced nuts and sodas in the room? This really steams my clams. Hidden charges: But what REALLY steamed my clams was the $20 fee the hotel adds to your bill to cover \"concierge services and shuttles to the strip.\" What?? Are you joking? What kind of hotel marks up your bill for concierge services, especially if you don't even use them? I am a Las Vegas local, and I stayed in the hotel after seeing a concert at the pool area. I had my own car and didn't need shuttle services to the strip (besides, I stayed on the hotel property the whole night). I also didn't use any concierge services whatsoever. When I called the front desk to ask about this charge, I was informed that it was a surcharge that was added to all guest room bills, regardless of whether the guest used the concierge or the shuttle. I was also told that it could not be removed from my bill. This was enraging! When I booked the trip on Orbitz, and when I checked in, I was not informed of this hidden charge. I would have cancelled my reservation out of principle and driven home after the concert if I had known about this absurd ripoff. Why is Red Rock Resort nickeling and diming its guests? Are they actually TRYING to destroy any goodwill they may otherwise have generated? Red Rock did such a great job of pissing me off that I will never stay here again, nor will I recommend them to my out of town guests. Nice going on the goodwill front, Red Rock! Elevators: Look out for the Olympic-length walk to your room! The hotel is crescent-shaped, and unfortunately, some genius decided to place the elevators at one end of the crescent, while the rooms extend along the crescent beginning at the elevators. I'm a healthy, in-shape male, but I had to walk about 500 feet to get to my room from the elevator -- and I was only about halfway down the crescent! I pity those who were at the very end. This is a very tiresome walk, especially with luggage. There's not much the hotel can do about it, but my advice is to get a bellhop to deliver your luggage to your room, instead of carrying or wheeling it yourself. Restaurants and Pools: This was perhaps the highlight of my visit. The Salt Lick, a BBQ joint on the premises, is outstanding.

I requested a quiet room and was promptly accommodated on the 17th floor (did I mention that the view was fantastic through an entire wall of floor to ceiling windows? The spacious room included a a large flat screen TV, deep soaking tub with a second, smaller flat screen in the marbled bathroom. Service is there when you need them to be and respectful when you want privacy. Food options abound, ranging from an inexpensive food court, two buffets and high end sushi and steak house. Several stylish bars, a night club and of course, the casino were all equally welcoming. If gambling is not your focus, the Red Rock offers a 14-plex movie theater, bowling lanes and an arcade for the younger family members. I was incredibly impressed with the pool scene. Good music, colorful towels, lounge chairs and cabanas were all arranged in a circle around the main pool, sporting numerous additional pools throughout. The spa has its own pool and lough area, which makes it nice for those who want a little distance from families with children. There is a bar complete with misting to keep you hydrated while sipping a wide variety of cocktails offered on the menu. The casino and hotel are both easily accessed from the centrally located pool area. The hotel spa was impressive and you automatically gain access through your resort fee of $20 a day, which gives you the opportunity to not schedule a treatment but still use the spa. Red Rock Resort offers free, prompt shuttle service (it's actually a small bus) to and from the Airport every two hours. A cab will cost you $55, depending on time of day and traffic. My wake up call was right on time and the bellhop, front desk and concierge staff were all friendly and helpful. You can arrange to go for hikes, bike rides and kayaking a short distance away in the Red Rock National Park area. I didn't get to take advantage of this so I can't review the activities. You can't go wrong staying here. A few things to keep in mind though: The pool closes at 7 or 8 PM and staffs security who will oust you from the area if you are there after hours. I would like to see the resort offer an area where you can sit outside and chill, AWAY from the casino in the evening. Also, the mini bar and snack tray have electronic sensors.

Upon arrival, there were not two rooms available for checkin which is understandable. The front desk rep was robotic. She told us it would take an hour and she would call us on our cell. Three hours later they called (about 345 pm). I arrived at the front desk and they had one room available. They could not get the second room until later. Other people were checking in as we continued to wait for our second room After a few minutes I asked why we could not get a second room. They said our room had already been assigned and it was not clean. Again, no apology, no sympathy. The seemed to feel I was lucky to be a customer. I asked if I could just cancel my rooms (3 night stay) and go somewhere else. They said I would have to pay for one night for both rooms. When Vanessa, the manager, got involved she was kind enough to allow me to pay for just one night for only one room. I felt that was unreasonable, since I had never been in a room, had the priveledge of hanging around their lobby for four hours even after the published checking time. I asked to see her superior and she said I could speak to him but he would give me the same answer. She said he was in a meeting and would not be available until later. I had the option of leaving and paying one night for one room or wait for him. I opted to checkin to both rooms (the second one became available) and check out the next morning without penalty and stay the next two nights at another hotel. Unbeleivable. The management of this hotel is just processing cattle. They could care less. It is an honor for you to be their customer. I finally spoke to Joe Saldana the front office manager. He agreed with my position and assured me he would speak to Vanessa. He asked what he could do to make amends. I told him nothing. I don't want anything. I am not asking for compensation. I want to be greated nicely, provided a room in a timely basis, treated as a human being and enjoy my stay. None of these things happened. I just wanted to have fun in Las Vegas for three days.

We arrive on New Years Day and the Hotel is fairly empty. The hotel itself is a beautiful resort in a breath-taking location. It is the perfect Vegas experience without the hustle and bustle of the Strip. However, should you love everything the Strip has to offer (which I do!!) you are only 13 miles away. During busy hours it can take 30 minutes with traffic, but I have made it to the Strip from the Red Rock in 12 minutes without traffic. It really is the best of both worlds. Cherry Nightclub is a lot of fun and the pool is great for singles, married couples, teenagers, and children. The Spa is a tranquil and relaxing setting and all the procedures I and friends have had are everything we expected and more. I personally recommend the Ashiatsu massage for those that enjoy an interesting and \"harder\" massage. The Sports Massage is also great for getting your body feeling loose and relaxed. While the prices aren't cheap for the Spa or Hotel, they are certainly comparable to other luxury resorts and definitely worth the money. The slots can be tighter, but that is expected at a higher dollar establishment. I personally don't gamble very much but the facilities are perfect if gambling is your pasttime. They are many varieties of machines and games. However, the cocktail waitresses do not come around as often as other places. The rooms are extremely modern and even the smallest room is a very decent size. I have had both the Strip and Canyon views separate times and they are equally nice depending on ones preference. The beds are extremely comfortable and the bathroom is large with a bathtub and plasma screen (which I have enjoyed relaxing in, every time I have been to the Red Rock). There is a movie theatre for kids and although it is a upscale hotel, they do have facilities the kids can enjoy. Many people have complained about the $19.95 resort fee. It is mentioned all over the Red Rock website and they make it clear when you book a room over the phone. Although it is not optional, it allows you to use the pool facilities, the trams to and from the Strip, the gym (which is exceptional for a hotel gym), and Spa. I may be forgetting other things that I have not used. Either way, going to the Spa each day to unwind (whether you have a treatment or not) is worth it. For those that don't believe me, just try it! This establishment is my favorite place to stay off the strip. And as much as I love the Strip, I would rather stay at the Red Rock and drive back and forth to the Strip since this hotel is so amazing! Word to the wise: It is not cheap and if you can't afford it, don't bother. There is no point in going to be miserable about spending so much money and not enjoying a cocktail, dinner, gambling, etc. I have had dinner at different restaurants in there and they are delicious.

We also enjoyed the movie theater and bowling alley. It is a really nice alternative to the strip. It was still Vegas, just a laid back cleaner version. There are a few drawbacks. The pool, while beautiful, was freezing!! Get there early if you want an umbrella. It was $23 for a margarita and a rum runner. The view is of a parking garage, even with the canyon view. Well, a parking garage, some suburbs, and then the rocks. We had a major issue with our keys. By the time we left, I had 5 keys. The first day, they didn't have the smoking king we requested, and we moved the second day. My curling iron disappeared in the move. I called housekeeping, and never got a response back. We were locked out of our room 5 different times. The elevator at the pool didn't go to our floor either, which was extremely frustrating. The hallways were VERY long, and the elevators are on one side. The curved design makes you feel like you are on a neverending quest! Also, the buffet lines were extremely long. Our last day, I waited 30 minutes in line (while my husband checked out). I gave it a higher rating though because this was a great place. A little tip- there is a CVS about a mile away.

You are charged a daily resort fee and I strongly suggest utililzing the spa facilities that you are paying for as well as the spa pool for quiet get away time. Utilize the water bottles, fruit juices, teas and fruits to recharge and energize. The staff is among the friendliest and most helpful of all the Vegas properties at which I have stayed.

The complimentary shuttle to and from the airport was nice, but we ended up having to wait an hour for the bus, because it only comes every couple of hours... The hotel was beautiful like everyone had claimed it to be. It was very modern and nicely decorated, not like your normal strip hotel. You also don't have to walk through the casino to get to your room. Infact, you don't even see much of it at all, because it's on the second floor so that was nice that we didn't have to trip over people at the slots to get to our room. I really like the fact that the doormen were always there to open the doors for you and greet you every time you enter and leave the building. It was a nice touch that most other casinos didn't do. The check-in took a long time because there was a line, but they were friendly. There is free water and apples at the counter so make sure to grab some when you can. When we went to our room we ended up getting one somewhere in the middle which is still far from the main elevator, but really close to the pool elevator. We didn't mind the walk really.. The view of the strip at night was very beautiful but a lot farther away than the pictures on their website suggest. And the first thing I saw when I looked out the window besides the strip in the distance was the eyesore of construction directly below. They are building another parking lot, so I strongly suggest staying on the canyon view side, because they ended up having to move us after two days due to the sound waking us up at six in the morning. The canyon view is much nicer anyway. You get the view of the pool as well which is a really beautiful pool even though we never got to use it. It was kind of chilly when we were there on Memorial Day, but the hot tub was nice. I liked the flat panel tv's and the bed was VERY comfortable. Probably more comfy than mine at home. The bathrooms had his and hers sinks, a deep soaking tub with tv and a stand up shower. You receive the daily paper in the morning outside your door. Again, very beautiful. Probably the nicest hotel room I've ever stayed in. For eateries they had many different choices. I wanted to eat at Cabo Mexican Restaurant, but we never had the opportunity. I strongly suggest the breakfast buffet at FEAST buffet. It is a very reasonable price. We had it the first three days. We also ate their once at supper time which was also just as good. The food court is pretty pricey though.. We ate there only once. We didn't go to their night clubs, because they weren't ever open and even if they were I don't think there would have been too many people in there.. We didn't get to see Zowie Bowie because he's only there on Thursdays through Saturdays.. We didn't go to their cinema, because I mean come on... you don't go to Vegas to watch a movie. You can do that at home! I heard the spa was worth going to, but we simply didn't have time during the day to go because we were always out at the strip. So we pretty much just stayed in our room at night and went on the casino floor for a little bit. We're not big gamblers, but they did have five cent black jack on the machines which was pretty fun. Didn't win much, but didn't lose much either. The reason I probably won't come back...I read nearly hundreds of reviews before booking this hotel and I probably should have listened more closely to one of the most important things people were constantly saying... If you're going to spend time on the strip you should probably stay at one of the hotels on the strip, because this hotel is probably about fifteen to twenty minutes away. I didn't think this was going to be a problem with their complimentary shuttle service. And if you're anything like me, driving in Vegas (especially around the strip area) is no option. It is just way to crazy for me and even my boyfriend to drive around there. However, upon arrival I found out that the shuttle bus only leaves every couple of hours and the last time they pick you up from the strip is 9:00 PM... Why? I kept asking myself this question. We missed all the night life and shows which is the reason why you go to Vegas in the first place. It would be different if they had something else to offer at Red Rock besides gambling at night, but their pool closes at 8:00 so by the time we come back there is nothing to do.. I couldn't believe they didn't offer a later shuttle service... Unfortunately, this is probably the only reason we will never stay at the Red Rock again which is a shame, because it really is a beautiful hotel. The upside of the location besides the beautiful view is that it is only eight miles from Red Rock Canyon. We rented a car for a day through enterprise which they have available at the hotel concierge office. They always have a couple of rental cars available at the hotel itself. The drive out there wasn't anything compared to the traffic of the strip so it was a nice drive. The views were spectacular and the canyons were a lot of fun to hike around. I suggest the first couple of stops on the scenic drive. Personally, I thought those were the most fun to hike because those rocks are easier to climb around and the most beautiful, because they have the red color. My boyfriend and I will definitely come back to hike the canyons again. Overall, the hotel was beautiful and elegant for the deal I recieved.. I wouldn't want to pay more than that. I loved how it was close to the canyons also. However, it is still way too far from the strip and the shuttle needs better drop-off and pick-up times.. If they could change their shuttle times to 24 hours I would come back in a heartbeat. I guess if you didn't want to visit the strip at all this would be a good place for you, but I mean come on this is VEGAS... if you want rest and relaxation go to Cancun...", "Date": "June 4, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Milton, Canada", "Title": "\u201cDefinitely a 5-star property!\u201d", "Author": "yam1976", "ReviewID": "UR16580406", "Content": "Stayed here for two nights over Memorial Day weekend.

We had just missed the free shuttle and in lieu of waiting 2 hours, got a sedan to take us out - it was $70 We checked in at noon and our room was ready. We had a standard room and it was awesome! Bed was so comfy!!! AMAZING Bathroom!!!!! We planned on bowling and going to the movies and playing bingo, but never had the chance so I can't comment on those activities. The Pool area is AWESOME!!!!! We walked around the area, but actually hung out at Cherry's pool - it was more intimate. Just a note: topless is allowed at this pool. We ate at the BBQ - really good food, but GIGANTIC portions!! Terra Rossa was really good. The sushi restaurant came highly recommended, but we never got there. The Grand Cafe has ok food, but found the service to be not so hot. The Mexican place in the food court was not good, but Villa Pizza was really good and Fatburgers was just ok. The Feast Buffet was really good provided you don't wait in line. There were l-o-n-g lines Sun and Mon, but none on Tuesday so we ate there that day. The bar in the lobby is a neat place to drink and chill out and people watch. We weren't there when Cherry was open - I had wanted to go there. The elevators come really fast - a nice change of pace from last year's experience at NYNY. We took the free shuttle back to the airport.

Was a little bit surprised that our meeting was so far off the Strip and other Vegas activities. So I came here with fairly low expectations. Surprise! When you drive up there is already a different Vegas experience. Staff is very friendly, not very \"uppity\" or stressed as at other Vegas strip hotels on a Friday afternoon. Decor in lobby is very modern, very cool furniture and chandelier. A general feeling of openness about the hotel and had great views of surrounding Red Rock mountains. During stay, staff was very friendly and helpful, check in and check out was a breeze. Free water bottles and apples available in lobby and gym. Free newspapers each morning, always a nice touch. Hotel is spacious both vertical and horizontal. Casino is on second floor, meeting rooms above, lobby and shops below. My room was on floor above Casino and I did not hear a sound. Also did not hear any noise from the Kanye West Concert that was going on around the pool that evening! Meeting facilities were great, many of the meeting rooms had great views of the Red Rock State Park. Also the large balconies in these rooms allowed for the meeting breaks to be very refreshing, did not have the claustrophobic feeling of some of the meeting rooms at the Strip Hotels. Never realized that Vegas had any natural beauty until I stayed at this hotel. Room I got was two queens, very large with large HD flat screen TV and another flat screen in bathroom, set up to watch in the bathtub. Shower was separate with glass enclosure. I used the gym facilities--very nice, had a small pool outside of the gym that was very private with lounge chairs and cabanas available for use. Great place to relax after a workout in the gym and not have to worry about the crowd at the main pool scene. Spa services also available, but did not partake. They can arrange outdoor activities--hiking, biking and even kayaking! No onsite golf course. Outside main pool is a happening place--lots of lounge chairs, cabanas available, fountain in middle of pool. Loud music, lots of activities. I did not hang out at this pool. Casino was not smokey! Also very friendly crowd, I think lots of locals hang out here and the crowd age was definitely on the younger side. Casino minimum bets were not as high as at the Strip hotels. There is a movie theatre and a bowling alley as part of the hotel--did not have time for either one on this trip. I was surprised by the food. Some of the best hotel food I have had in a long time, ate 4 meals at the hotel as part of our business meeting. All meals were different and the food was very good, even the Asian dishes, I am Asian and am very picky about this type of food, but was really surprised by how good the food was. Did I miss not being on the Strip? No, I actually enjoyed the lack of crowds and the chaos of the Strip. Would I come back again--definitely. May not be for the first time Vegas visitor--it is about 30 minutes northwest of the Strip or a $50 cab ride, but if you are looking for something different, I would definitely recommend this hotel.", "Date": "May 23, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Saddlebrooke, MO", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful Oasis-Will return again\u201d", "Author": "frg1995", "ReviewID": "UR16208139", "Content": "We have been to Las Vegas several times prior to this trip and usually stayed on strip or at the Orleans which we like very much but this time we wanted to do things totally different.

We had booked through Allegiant Air and chose this resort package. I had called direct and requested higher level floor and possibly with mountain or pool view. Well, we got it all. They placed us on 12th floor to begin with but upon walking in and going barefoot into the bathroom we noticed carpet very wet. Called down to desk and was told they would move us up to 16th floor, sending bellman up with keys to change rooms. The rooms are awesome from furnishing very contemporary to the view of not only of Red Rock Canyon but a direct view of beautiful pool. Everywhere we looked the rooms were well cleaned and no problems with staff. In fact, our check in guy, Alfonso was extremely pleasant and sent to our room the next day bottle of sparkling wine to celebrate our anniversary. Did not open then but requested from T-Bones restaurant if could bring down but would charge $35.00 corking fee! Well, we chose to open in our room and enjoy. The pool staff is very accomodating and pleasant. Pool area--well, it is the best and always plenty of places to lounge. Too bad the hours are 9:00am-7pm because would be great to have evening swim or sit by pool area and relax at night. We loved the starting mornng with breakfast buffet, wait staff very nice and attentive. Grand Cafe was okay but we ate most away. Not gamblers but loved the hotels decor and amazed how well built and corrdinating interior and exterior was through out. The Valet was very good and never kept us waiting long and ALWAYS ask if you need directions anywhere (nice touch). Also, in the main hotel lobby they keep bottled water available all the time and you can have whenever you like plus the best crisp apples. Would we stay here again? You bet and I don't think you would be unhappy at all with this choice. Booked a Grand Canyon West Rim with Skywalk and we had rented car so drove out to see Valley of Fire (what views). This is great place if you rent a car but can see if fees for taxis are high and you like the strip scene, you might want to reconsider.

The property is beautiful and \"potentially\" one of the best in Vegas. But the management is very poor. So poor, in fact, that it is on the verge of absurdity. Example number one....their beautiful pool area is the best place in Vegas to be choked by cigar and cigarette smoke. We were absolutely amazed that time after time we got \"comfortable\" only to be run out by another new cigar smoker. It was truly a flashback to the 1960's. Example number two......the sports book personnel \"assured\" me that they had 24 hour ticket cashing. Well, the actual number of hours to cash winning tickets was more like 18 hours. After the NCAA semifinals were played I drove from the Venetian to cash my tickets. The computers were \"down.\" Their 24 hour computers were more accurately \"closed.\" There was much confusion as to when they would re-open. Each employee that I talked to gave me a different time. Finally, the NIGHT MANAGER told me that they would \"correct\" this problem so no one would be \"inconvenienced\" by faulty information in the future. When I inquired \"what's in it for me?\" she replied that she was \"sorry.\" I had a plane to catch in three hours and no time to come back. She said that I could \"mail\" the tickets in. To me an \"I'm sorry\" is very poor compensation for going way out of my way on an already busy morning. Example number three.....we were told at the end of our last visit on President's Day (2008) to contact a \"certain high ranking manager\" on our NEXT visit to receive \"considerations\" for finding \"illegal substances\" in our room upon check in. We left a message for this manager on our FIRST day and checked out without ever having our call returned. Very disappointing. They also ignored these same complaints on our \"customer evaluation card\" and never contacted us to \"follow up\" on those concerns either.

Our room was not yet ready, but the check in consultant worked with us to ensure we had no stress while waiting to get into our room.

The available services were extensive and the prices (coming from the North East) were actually reasonable. The pool was great, the atmosphere, the available food choices were wonderful and the choices of clubs and lounges were many; a small, self-contained city within itself. What I didn't like was the idea of pets in the hotel; unless there are rooms solely dedicated to pet owners, I'd prefer to have no pets beyond seeing eye pets.

Yes, it was a little hike to the elevators but who doesn't need a little exercise. I would not rave about the famous buffet there. It was mediocre at best. The Italian restauraunt was very good. Also, the cafe is good for a quick bite. There are so many different places to eat at this resort, you really never have to leave. The casino is ok and what I liked about this place is that you can walk through the lobby and casino and it seemed virtually empty, whereas you can't even get through the casinos on the strip without bumping into people. Tables did not get crowded and the staff was very helpful and friendly. It is a bit distant from the strip but if you rent a car,no problem and it's nice to escape back to Red Rock for a relaxing night. I did not find it noisy at all.

I am a quieter personality type, hence I really enjoyed this resort. The Conference I was attending booked the trip in this resort so I did not personally choose the resort. The spa is the nicest I have ever experienced and I have traveled quiet a bit.

I would have liked the opportunity to walk down the Strip at various times vs. having to plan large blocks of time to get there. I just don't see the logic in this large nice resort being so far from the Strip. The T-Bone restaurant was excellent as well as the Italian Restaurant. I ordered room service a few times and it took 75 minutes and was not very good. If you are a coke drinker - the resort only serves Pepsi products. And, yes everything in Vegas is expensive. Do not touch anything in the mini-bar or the food on the dresser. The TVs appeared to be nice (flat screen etc) but the one remote did not work very well and the bathroom TV had very limited TV channels.

Other people in our group checked into dirty rooms and or didn't get room service for 2 days. One of our party checked into a room that had a used condom in the sink. At check out, a review of my bill didn't show the $50 credit, but showed a additional $43.58 resort fee per night that was never disclosed to me. On checkout, the front desk made my blood boil, again when they said that they could only issue the $50 credit against a room service charge and the only room service charge we had was for a $40 bowl of oatmeal, so we would only be getting a $40 credit. The outrageously expensive $246 massage didn't count, nor the very expensive $300 and $400 dinners, not even the $2.50 per local call. There only saving grace was their bellmen.

My opinion is that sometimes things go wrong but if an effort is made to solve the unhappiness is acceptable. Many hotels don't even try but the Red Rock does. This is a fabulous hotel/resort. It has everything and the service was wonderful!!! Everyone was helpful, polite and went out of there way to serve us. The rooms are large, comfortable and great views.

However..... We had a Signature suite which is basically 2 room with a middle room. (or 1 standard bedroom with attached bigger 2 rooms) We had the jacuzzi suite, which you would expect have a...jacuzzi! well, there was one but it was not working at all. There was however a big gaping section of paint from the room above whose jacuzzi was leaking, through our roof over the towels and on our floor. To their credit they did send a maid to clean up and offer to swap rooms, but trying to clear up 3 rooms to move just did not seem worth it. Add to that the following: of a resort fee of about $45 per day which we were not informed of when booking- when I queried this I was told this was for the resort facilities at our disposal ie the pool (which was closed for both days we were there due to wind and rain.) Turn down service which we did not recieve either night....oh and we were on the 10th floor and the elevators all broke so we had to walk it up.... Again, they did credit this $45 per night, but only after I got really upset about being charged for facilitiies that were neither provided or they were unable to provide. As Australians we always tend to find service staff in the States to be really really attentive and just so much better that we tend to have at home (no doubt due to the wages/ tipping structure Im sure!) However....nearly all of the staff employed by the shops within the complex including the hotel shop were not at all what we had come to expect. The male staff at the kids amusement centre were just horrible, the girl at the ice cream parlour left a tap running at full steam for the full 10 minutes we waited to be served. Hello....you are in Nevada, and you are in drought! The queue to go to the bowling alley was over 1.5 hours both days (so we did not go) The staff at the souvenier shop were unable to finish a conversation with each other whist serving me! My sister has moved to Vegas for work, and lives 5 minutes away. This would be so helpful if only this was somewhere I would be prepared to go to again. I am not a negative person, nor do I have unrealistic expectations, but this cost me over $800 per night and indeed have given glowing reviews to Chateau Marmont where we also stayed, but to be honest, when I go back this christmas, I will not stay there again.

The hotel is new (about 2 years old), beautiful, tastefully decorated and very modern. The entire resort is impressive. Our room was very spacious, with a large, comfortable bed, many fluffy pillows and a flat screen tv to complete the experience. The bathroom had a separate tub and roomy shower, another flat screen tv and two sink area, where my husband and I could not fight for the space. Room was always clean and the bed made-up daily without exception. Staff was beyond helpful and courteous. The casino floor was enough in itself. Beautiful decor, fresh air and great pay-out. As for food, there are so many delicious restaurants to choose from but my favorite had to be the great buffet, filled daily with the most delicious things, including 20 varieties of cheesecake. It is too bad that it was December because the outside pool is so beautiful that I would have loved to use it. After experiencing the noise and filth of some of the hotels on the strip, we were very glad to be back into our hotel. Even though it is off the strip, it is like a diamond in the rough. Not to mention that the very famous red rock mountains are just a short ride from the hotel. Actually, if not for the fact that we wanted to see the strip, we would have never left the resort because it is so self-sustaining, and as long as you are a guest of the hotel you can use spa amenities such as hot tub, whirlpool and sauna with no charge.

It's got a sizable casino, great pool, excellent spa, some good restaurants/bars, a big bowling center, full movie-plex, and a fun after-hours club. It's very clean--only a few years old. And, nowhere near as crowded as the other casinos. On top of that, you're not going to get comparable rooms elsewhere in vegas for anywhere near the price. For what you get, It's a steal. HOWEVER. There is one caveat. The Red Rock IS NOT on the Strip (e.g. all the other Vegas casinos you're used to). The Red Rock is not even NEAR the Strip. You're at least a 20-minute drive from the Strip. (Note: The \"Strip View\" rooms at the Red Rock are a tad misleading. Yes, you can technically \"see\" the strip, but it's a long way off). I knew this because I've stayed there before. And frankly, since I was going to Vegas for some R&R (and I'm not a gambler), I welcomed that. I liked the idea of both being able to go to the strip and enjoy the shopping, dining, and shows that the other casinos offer...while also having the luxury of spending time at the Red Rock where I could get away from all the massive throngs of people on the strip. (TIP: If you're going to be going back and forth to the Strip a lot, rent a car. Cab fare is going to be at least $40 each way). If you've never been to Vegas before, the Red Rock is probably NOT for you--because you'll likely want to spend the majority of your time exploring the Las Vegas Strip. As such, you'll want to stay somewhere on the Strip. However, if you're looking for a getaway where you can enjoy both the nightlife and bustle of Vegas...but also get away from it for a while....

We were thrilled with the place the moment we arrived. The hotel and property is of a very modern design - think post-modern Tokyo - filled with clean lines, dark, rich colors, and well thought out contrasting textures. The front desk personnel were efficient, cheerful and helpful. The rooms were spotless and large and included a HUGE marble clad bathtub w/ flat screen TV. I don't know about you, but soaking w/ the tube is all right in my book! The bed was one of the most comfortable I've ever slept in - better than the Westin's. The casino was a visual delight and remarkably not smoky. I enjoyed the fact that $5 craps and blackjack tables were abundant throughout the morning and afternoon. We ate lunch at the Cabo Grill or whatever their Mexican restaurant was. The fare was ok...but we're spoiled w/ great San Diego Mexican food, so we're hard to please in this realm. We also ate lunch at the Italian restaurant on the property and enjoyed it. The restaurants are reasonably priced. One thing I didn't like was that the room service menu seemed overpriced compared to other places we've stayed (Hyatt, Sofitel, etc...) and the minibar was tantamount to highway robbery.

Lots of little things, but I will highlight a few......I booked the hotel for my boyfriend's birthday weekend, sending them an email request for champagne prices because I wanted a bottle in our room upon arrival. No one got back to me via phone or email, I left both pieces of information. I called weeks later, just prior to us leaving for the trip (had to call twice because they hung up on me the first time) and managed to get an order in. Once we arrived, we hung out in hotel until check in time. When we went to check in, they told us they had no rooms available and it would be a few hours. I told her to cancel the champagne, because I wanted it upon arrival, not sent to the room later. She told me they had no order in the system. We walked around looking for a \"nice\" bar to grab a drink. None of the \"nice\" bars were open ~ they do not open until 4, an hour past check in time. At 4, the lobby bar (beautiful) did open, but when I requested a white wine, we were told that their white wine shipment had not arrived that day. I ordered Merlot. We finally checked in and the front desk DID send a bottle of champagne (very nice and put us on the right track again), but service issue happened ALL weekend. I had booked a birthday dinner (Sunday night) in their Italian restaurant and requested an out of the way table for a romantic dinner explaining that it was his birthday, etc. Once we got there, we were put in the middle of the floor next to a table of 9 men drinking. Also, they had a door that opened to the outside that they continued use (it would stay open for some time before finally closing again). It was a cool November night, so cold air kept coming in, making it difficult to stay warm. Men around us were giving women their sport coats, my boyfriend and I did not bring jackets, we did not expect to need them in a restaurant. Lastly, on many occasions, at least one item we ordered (all at different restaurants) never came. There were lots of small problems with service as well and several rude staff that would ignore you, walk away from you or act annoyed that they had to help you. The actual resort is just lovely, as are the rooms. But so many small things kept going wrong, I wished we had booked a different hotel.

I have been a casino player in my misspent youth, from Nassau to Atlantic City to Reno, but no longer. Still, I feel capable of rating a casino as well as a hotel. But first, permit me to address concerns of those posting this past week. Las Vegas is set in a desert valley. It gets its water from Lake Mead, man-made after construction of the Hoover Dam. This has had an impact on development as much as the casinos themselves. In short, Las Vegas Blvd. is where it all started, and the big name casinos are all found within a mile of one another on that ugly stretch of asphalt otherwise known as The Strip. There is nothing inspiring about these monuments to all things tacky. But if you want to see and be seen among the faux statuary and balloon-sized breasts, this is where you go. If on the other hand, you actually want to combine a vacation of good food, good room, modern pool scene (including legitimate lap pool), first rate spa, and family-friendly diversions, you'll want something removed from the center of the plastic universe. If you want to go east of town next to Lake Mead, try Ritz Carlton at Lake Las Vegas. But be prepared to pay RC rates for rooms, and most Ritz properties charge the so-called resort fee which has apparently shocked some of Red Rock's customers. It is a nuisance, but it is increasingly industry-wide. If you want to go west of town, you might try J.W. Marriott, but for my money (and the rooms are incredibly reasonable), you'll want to stay at Red Rock. (Several posters: \u2018cab rides downtown were $40;\u2019 \u2018the complimentary shuttle to the Strip took too long.\u2019 Would that be the shuttle taking you away from this hotel\u2019s casino to gamble at another hotel\u2019s casino? And it\u2019s free?) Of course you'll need a rental car. This is Las Vegas, not New York, and there is no public transportation. There's also no charge for valet parking, and despite another poster's complaint, self-parking lots are easily identified (dude, there's a sign) for those too, um, thrifty to spring for a $2 tip for the guy who brings your car to you. The vibe upon entry is a sophisticated, sleek, modern resort, where nearly every reviewer agrees that staff is courteous to a fault. The hotel entrance is behind the casino, so non-gamers can avoid the casino crowds altogether if desired. Rooms are spacious, dark wood and carpet (a Kimpton-like fuscia/lime/chocolate brown motif), with pleasant indirect lighting and a massive flat screen facing the bed. But the bedding is too comfortable, so you\u2019ll fall asleep before the end of the movie. A smaller flat screen overlooks the ample tub, with separate marble shower and a commode enclosed in its own leather-lined room. Bath products are private label. Rack rate in November was something like $169/night, with spacious suites roughly twice that. Adding tax and resort fees still brings you in under $200/night, which just ain't gonna break the bank like a bad night at the tables. Room service was timely; house keeping desperately understaffed. Concierge and valet services were thorough and prompt. (I've waited a lot longer for my car at much more expensive hotels, and car rental rates are less than the cost of a couple of cab rides, so I'm not sure what the beef was for some of the reviewers. My advice to them in the future would be to look at a map before booking.) Pool scene was again low-key, elegant, but understaffed (probably owing to time of year and day of week). Spa was well-stocked and well-run. Others have pointed out the kid-friendly options: a legitimate movie theater with multiple screens; a substantial arcade; a mall-sized food court; a retro-cool bowling alley. The casino was ringed by themed restaurants, including Italian, Asian, raw bar, steak house, etc. There's a complimentary cocktail party with sushi service on Friday nights, a Starbucks above the lobby. In short, you never have to leave, but you can. If you do, you are on a beltway (215), which can take you to Hoover Dam in half an hour, or on a main road, which can deliver you to Red Rock Canyon for authentic mountain scenery in ten minutes. Contrast the Strip, where the crush of cars and construction trucks will only serve to remind you of the traffic jams you thought you left back home.) The casino itself had ample table space in addition to the electronic game and slot aisles dominating today's casinos. $5 and $10 minimum blackjack tables were easily available (and I haven't seen a $5 table in Atlantic City in this century.) Pit bosses were business-like and cordial, unlike some of the heavies you run into on the Strip. But the best example of management's style can probably be found in its casino hosts. This cadre of troubleshooters and concierge professionals give the resort a quiet dignity too often lacking in the mega-resort meat markets. I dealt with a gentleman named Winston Morgan, who handled dinner reservations, social concerns, and a private movie screening with equal aplomb. When we canceled the movie party, he asked if I needed a limo for the next morning. In short, I was able to stay at a complete hotel-casino resort with more amenities than many better-known upscale chains and decor from the cool earth tones of modern prairie design, and never have to worry that I wasn't spending enough time at the tables. I was able to relax, which is something most visitors to Las Vegas don't seem able to do.

Here are some of my observations: 1) Hotel is off strip and not \"off strip\" like the Palms or Hard Rock. It's REALLY off strip. It is a $40-50 cab ride from the airport and probably that much to the strip (factoring in trafifc). The hotel offers shuttle service to the strip and airport. I didn't take the strip shuttle but heard it drops you off at the fashion show mall. My airpot shuttle (on a Sunday) left every odd hour between 7am and 7pm. Shuttles are complimentary. 2) Casino is your average Vegas casino with less wacky folk (since its off strip) and has probably more than its fair share of locals. $5 BJ tables were around most of the day and $10 BJ tables were around almost all day. 3) Amenities - Pools are awesome - looks exactly like the pictures on the website. Pool side food is so-so. There is also an on-site bowling alley, movie theater, game room and food court. Bowling alley was clean/nice/fun. Food court was a decent alternative to restaurants (especially for lunch). 4) Spa - A+ spa. Great locker area, sauna, jacuzzi, spa pool, etc. I did experience some banging (from construction upstairs) during my massage but was promptly given a 20% discount which I thought was fair. The banging only lasted about 5 minutes during my 50 minute massaage. Only complaint is that the gym is small - almost an afterthought it seems. 5) Food - I only ate at the Grand Cafe and Hachi (Japanese restaurant) while I was there. No complaints on the food quality but with all hotel food, it was a bit on the pricey side. Overall, I would give this hotel an A. It is a great hotel for those who are sick and tired of the strip and just want a relaxing vegas vacation.", "Date": "November 5, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Silver Spring, Maryland", "Title": "\u201cVery Nice, but Far from Strip\u201d", "Author": "kyoto5301", "ReviewID": "UR10599354", "Content": "The Red Rock has lovely rooms which are very well appointed.

Listen I am a 45 yr old mother of 3 (came wthout them). I go to Vegas once or twice a year among other vacation spots so I know hotels. I mostly go for the hotel getaway experince so trust this review. This visit we stayed 2 nights at the Venetian payed alot of $$, it was just nice. Then without plan or notice I walked into Red Rock just to check it out and said \"change my flight, I'm staying the night\" I mean I knew it while driving up to it. Now dont get me wrong, if you want the hustle and bustle of the strip constantly then there are a ton of great hotels there (Mandalay Bay being one) but if you want a \"get away\" resort/casino then Red Rock it is. Here is how you base a great hotel, not on your stay and what happen to you that night, but on the actual hotel itself Clean clean clean everywhere, every spot in that room was sparkling. AHH & comfort, from the big deep tub with the tv in front of it, the chairs by the window views, the new clean carpet, to the most comfortable pillows and bed ever. How about cool and modern? Everything is ultra sheek, new, high tech, even the mini bar didnt just offer drinks but oh so much more (like fun stuff for adults, if you choose and pay for of course). Dont forget the 2 comfy bathrobes and slippers, the incredible fast, accurate and kind room service. I mean this guy didnt just bring our coffee and leave, he poured it and stayed a minute to converse. How about they turned our bed sheets down, fluffed our pillow, put slippers by our bedside, all while we were out at the casino for the night, so nice to come back to. Now for the hotel! Unbelievable decor, I mean seriously I can only attempt to tell you, you have to see it! The lighting is not only breath taking its all real crystals, just ask, I did. There is so much art everywhere, but cool calming stuff. The absolute coolest bars each with ther own cool flair, every kind of restaurant , from sushi to mexican and more.. (have at least a drink outside of Tbones) , a food court, bowling alley, bingo hall, and a Regal 16 movie theater, yup right there. So I guess you could bring the kids.They offer a great adventure tour to the mountains, kayaking hiking etc...You know sometimes you dont just want to gamble, but if you do...its great and doesnt have only $100 minimum tables, for us $5 minimum folks, it has alot of both... All the prices are average like, not strip like prices, I mean we had dinner and drinks for $41.00 dollars at Cabo. At the end I hated to go ( they asked me what time I was checking out 11:00, 12:00?) we took the Red Rock luxury free airport shuttle back to Us Airways and off home back to Florida!

It was anything but. It's the perfect place if you like being in the middle of a major construction project that starts work at 6am every day and adjacent to a busy freeway! Don't be fooled by the hotel's website. The first night the room was very hot, despite our turning the thermostat down and the fans up full blast. The next morning we were awakened at 6.30am by an incredible amount of noise from the work being done on the top floor. It was a grinding, buzzing noise that literally vibrated throughout the room and continued the entire day. Later that morning, I went downstairs and complained to the concierge about the noise. She called the manager, who apologized and said the workmen were not supposed to start until 10.30am and that if it happened again I should call and they would see that it was stopped immediately. She also said she would \"make an adjustment\" to my account to compensate for the problem. She asked if we were checking out the next morning, which I confirmed to be the case. She also said she would send people up to fix the air-conditioning. Two men arrived to work on the AC and while my wife and I were sitting in the room they managed to disconnect a hose and some kind of gas sprayed out into the room. Not a pleasant experience and the thought \"Legionnaires Disease\" immediately sprang to mind. It really seemed they didn't have a clue what they were doing. But eventually the AC was working again 24 hours after our arrival. Despite my conversation with the manager, the next morning we were rudely awakened even earlier, 6.15am, by the same noise coming from the top floor construction crews. I phoned and the noise immediately stopped, but the damage had been done as far as we were concerned. The noise started up again around 9.30am. When we checked out, we complained again about the noise to another manager. She said the other manager wouldn't be in until 2pm (three hours after checkout time) and she had done nothing to \"make an adjustment\" to my account, or even leave a note about my complaints. The manager said she would make a note, speak to her colleague when she came in to work and email me about a resolution. I told her this was entirely unacceptable. So I had to detail all of the above to her again and she agreed to cancel the room charge for one of our two nights. All things considered it really should have been for both nights. But more than the problems we had once there, we actually feel slightly deceived by the way the hotel is marketed on the website. Having stayed there, I realize that some of the photos have been faked to make it look like the hotel is something that it is not. Just compare the photo I took from our room with the shot from the hotel website showing a Strip View room. It has clearly been \"photoshopped\" to make the The Strip appear much closer (and to mask the reality of the hotel being surrounded by a massive construction project). My own photo of the view from our room has not been altered in any way. Similarly, the view on the website of the red rocks from which it gets its name has been manipulated. In reality, you have to look very hard to see those rocks, as they are on the other side of the freeway. After we returned home I received an email from a Mr Ronan O'Gorman, VP Hotel & Casino, asking for feedback about our stay. Despite replying with a long, detailed account of our nightmare, I've yet to have a reply from Mr O'Gorman. So I decided to share our experience her on Trip Advisor. So avoid this place as it's not what it's cracked up to be. It's a very long way from The Strip, surrounded by a massive construction project and freeway, and has construction work going on on the top floors that makes the place totally unbearable and the management have no regard for their customers.", "Date": "October 6, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Medina, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cI could live here!\u201d", "Author": "sunnnychick", "ReviewID": "UR10041440", "Content": "Hubby and I stayed at Red Rock in June for 3 nights and most recently at the end of September for one night. I can't say enough good things about this hotel. It is definitely one of our favorites. The rooms are large, the beds are comfy and the bathrooms are great. We didn't have any problems with the maid services on either of our stays, and hubby can be picky! Both of our rooms were very clean. We received turn down service with chocolates on the pillow every night. For both of our stays we had strip view rooms on high floors but they were far away from the main elevators and it was quite a hike. We did request a closer room on our first stay but after checking it out opted to stay in the first room we were given. Apparently the rooms past the pool elevators are in the \"newer\" wing of the hotel and we both thought that the \"newer\" room was slightly bigger and nicer than the older one. The pool area is amazing. It is large with comfortable lounge chairs and plenty of room. In addition to the main circular pool there are scattered hot tubs and smaller pools as well. The spa is great for relaxing or working out and for a little more peace and quiet the spa pool is perfect. The hotel is far from the strip, about 20-30 minutes. We always rent a car though so it was not a huge issue for us. The only issues we had with the hotel was that during our first stay the pool closed early two nights in a row for a private function. There was no warning of this till midday at which point we were already gone. We specifically left the strip early to enjoy the pool only to find it closed once we arrived back at the hotel. The spa pool was open though, and it wasn't crowded so at least we could use that. On our most recent stay; we were awoken at 5 am by construction noise. Hubby is a light sleeper so he was pretty annoyed. Definitely stay on the mountain side if you are a light sleeper. Again, I can't say enough good things about this hotel. The service, staff, everything has been impeccable on both of our stays.

Here is an unbiased review of the property. Upon check-in, we were greeted by RJ (BJ?). I use the term greeted lightly since we felt less than welcomed by her. Honestly, she came across as very stand offish and putout. Not friendly at all. No welcome, have a nice stay etc. First impressions count and checking in with her was definitely not a pleasure nor a highlight. First impressions count. She should be in the casino money room, out of sight from the general public with her bad attitude. Some other clown at the front desk kept repeating the same mantra to everyone that checked in \u201cOnly the best for you\u201d. What a bunch of BS\u2026We found out that our room was not ready (7-7-07) which was to be expected on such a busy day since there were so many weddings in Vegas that day. So off to the casino we went. We went to the sports book to wager on some baseball. First and foremost, the Sports Book royally rips you with their drink rules! The Sports book gives 1 drink ticket for each $20.00 wagered. You only get 2 drink tickets for $50.00 wagered which is a complete ripoff! Also, they will not give you a drink ticket unless you ask for one. Also, for 1 import beer and a Bloody Mary it is 3 drink tickets, not 2 as one would think. So basically you would have to wager $70.00 for 3 drink tickets! In the main casino you can get any drink you want while playing any of the games, even the lowest wager games. The casino overall was nice but ran into a glitch there too. The casino computers were down on the morning we checked out so could not cash any tickets at the sports book. Very bad for a supposedly top notch casino to be having computer problems! The Blackjack dealer said the computers had been down for an hour when we asked and was not sure when they would be back up! We finally checked into our room around 5:00pm. We had a strip view room on the 17th floor. Great view of the strip from the upper floor. Room was larger than I expected, however, the bathroom was small but did have a small flat panel television above the tub which was nice. The main room has a 42-inch plasma television, however, the remote control was touchy and did not work all of the time. As for the housekeeping, I must say they are one of the worst I have encountered at any hotel/resort. A supposed top notch resort should not have that many glitches with housekeeping. First off, we did not receive turndown on our first night even though it was requested. Also, we had asked for 2 extra pillows. Well, 2 hours later someone came up to the room and even though the do not disturb sign was lit still banged on the door! VERY BAD!! Also, after a day at the pool we returned to the room to find one of the maids dirty slop rags on top of on of our bags in the room! Cheese curls from the previous guest were found near the bed on the floor upon checking into the room! The carpet in the room is dark and was not vacuumed on the edges, apparently ever! Also, the bed reading lamp was missing a bulb on one side, which was later found on the floor under the bed. We were warned by the front desk not to touch the mini bar unless absolutely wanting to use and item! Anything that you pickup from the mini-bar for more than 45 seconds will be charged to your room. Very weird policy! Just get rid of the pass\u00e9 mini-bar! Hello, nobody wants stale nuts and skunked beer! There was an \u201cintimacy package\u201d on the mini bar. Not sure what was in it but it was around $30.00. Must have been good for that price! Hmmmm. The Bose CD stereo in each room is a blessing and a curse. Knuckleheads next door to us blared their stereo at top volume. Walls are thin in rooms too so all could be heard. As for the pool, first and foremost, Alexandra the pool waitress sucked big time. She had a nice big, smug attitude. We ordered two Bloody Marys and 2 waters from her. She brings us the $4.00 per tiny bottle waters, when all throughout the hotel there are free tiny bottles of water available. We sent them back and she apparently copped a tude about the returned waters and refused to come over and wait on us the rest of the time we were by the pool. She seemed to wait on the folks who were flaunting their wealth quite fine though. Hmmmm?? We ended up going up to the pool bar to eat lunch since she would not come over to wait on us. Beware that an 18% gratuity is added to everything when ordering poolside. Definitely would have stiffed Alexandra if given the option to do so without having been forced to tip. I totally agree with other postings that throughout the resort, there is an air of arrogance with some of the staff - it seems that they REALLY cater to the people that \"probably have money\" but provide minimal service to others they deem not worthy. I must say that Allison the lifeguard was very friendly. She actually showed us to our pool chairs and carried towels and also brought us some waters since Alexandra the Witch would not wait on us. The pool area did have nice lounge chairs with cushions. Some larger bed type loungers were also available but appeared to be reserved well in advance. Also, apparently we are in another era of population growth in the U.S.A. so prepare yourself to be surrounded by lots of kids in the main pool! Fountain in center attracts them like flies on you know what! Prepare for no R&R or P&Q around the main pool with screaming brats everywhere! Cherry pool next to a large wall which was a bit strange. Smaller lap pools also scattered about pool area. Water was ICE cold in pools, almost too cold even with air temperatures around 110\u00b0. The \u201cMIX\u201c music blaring at pool was nice for the first hour, then got a bit old. They need to mix up the music a bit, no pun intended. The pool bar was nice with Arizona Misters and table games. The pool bar food was good too. The valet and bellmen were very nice, actually the nicest employees we encountered in the whole resort. The gym was not very big for such a large resort. It was adequate, with some dumbbells, treadmills and a stairmaster that squeaked to high heaven. The treadmills had flat screen televisions mounted on them but no sound, only closed captioning. Have seen much better resort gyms for sure. Anyone who has ever stayed at the JW Marriott Cancun knows what I mean. If you do stay here check all of the available pricing options such as Orbitz, Travelocity and the hotel website. Actually got a better rate for a strip view room on Orbitz which included a $50.00 resort credit. Red Rock Resort also gouges you for $19.99 per day for a Resort Fee so don\u2019t be surprised when it appears on your final bill. Don\u2019t pay more for the Canyon/pool view which overlooks I-215 which is not much of view. The strip view is much better, particularly at night and from the higher floors. On checkout, our bags almost left in another guest\u2019s car, who happened to have the same last name as ours. Now that would have been ugly! I could imagine the look on their face when they got back to California with someone elses dirty underwear! Ate at Cabo Mexican in the Casino which was good. Also ate at the fast food Mexican in the food court which was excellent! If you have LOTS of money to burn and like screaming kids surrounding you while poolside this may be your place. Otherwise, steer clear of Red Rock Resort Casino & Spa. We would definitely not stay at this property again. The JW Marriott down the street is much less pretentious and nicer in our opinion. And you can always take a taxi to the Red Rock Resort Casino & Spa if you feel the need to make a donation!

Watch out at the pool, they include a 20% gratuity on your bill and the service is not worth it, don't tip twice since they don't have to earn it. The cab rides to and from the airport are $50 and the hotel shuttle only runs every two hours to the airport.

The good: - Pool area is great although the cost of the private cabanas is a little extreme. Not really needed though unless you want complete peace & quiet. - Fitness centre is very good for a resort although several of the cardio machines with tv's were not working. It would also be nice if there was disinfectant available to clean off the machines between users. - The rooms are very nice & the plasma tv's are a nice touch. - The Feast Buffet is a great place for breakfast. For less than $20.00 you can eat until your content. Staff were friendly. - Also had great food & service at the Cabo Mexican restaurant. - The movie theatre & bowling lanes are a great touch. The Bad: - The $43.00 cab fare if you don't feel like waiting for the shuttle is a bit of an opener & really lets you know how far away you actually are from the strip. - Do not let a cabbie take you to Meadows Mall. We took the shuttle to the Fashion Show Mall one day & then thought we'd go out shopping another day. We had passed all kinds of shops along the way in from the airport & thought we'd check them out only to have the cabbie take us to some run-down mall close to the strip. Not a very fun experience! - We were upgraded to a Canyon View room which also looks out onto the pool. Big mistake! Good luck getting a good nights sleep because the music never stops! If the nightclub is open you'll be kept up all night. When I called down to the front desk to ask what was going on I was told it will stop at around 4am. We were given the option of moving to a room on the Strip Side but at 1am I thought I'd just try & grind through it. - I know it's Vegas but the prices for food & drinks around the pool are insane. $34.00 for a hamburger, hot dog & a pepsi. Some of the servers are friendly but others are just miserable (although walking around in a bikini all day might do that to you). - Spa prices were double what you'd pay if you weren't on vacation. That might explain why you don't see alot of people using the spa services. In a nutshell...if you're looking for a place to stay but not feel like you're in Vegas then this is it. It's a great resort in the middle of the desert & if you couldn't see the strip then you'd never know you were even in Vegas.

My girlfriend and I went to Vegas for 4 nights to celebrate my birthday and stayed at the RR for three nights. We were originally scheduled to spend two nights at RR and two nights on the Strip (TI), but spoke with the front desk to extend our stay at RR an extra day shortly after checking-in. The property just blew us away. Would have spent the entire trip at RR but we had exceeded the 48 hour cancellation window at TI and had an early morning flight out that would have been difficult given the distance of RR from the airport. Room: Wow! Outstanding room with a most comfortable bed. Big flat screen TV, two nice loungers and an iPod docking station/radio. Huge bathroom containing a separate shower, deep-soaking tub, water closet and double vanity. You also get a second flat screen TV if you want to spend a little extra time getting ready! Good toiletries and nice robes and slippers. Casino: Impressive facility with high ceilings, dark woods and beautiful chandeliers throughout. Personnel were uniformly nice. Even had a little luck there. Restaurants/Bars: - Salt-Lick was very good, but don\u2019t have any late-night plans if you order the all-you-can-eat\u2026I\u2019m still full a week later. Excellent brisket and ribs. - Grand Caf\u00e9: Very good breakfast and sandwich items. Late night service was a little slow but given the crowds and the hour, not excessive or too be unexpected. - Sandbar: Waiters weren\u2019t the best, but not bad. They seemed to be trying to be a little too cool to provide great wait service. Food was very good and seating/location was great. - Bars: Really liked Onyx and Lucky, especially the later. Cool vibe, great drinks and good music (nice mix, not just dance/club music). Onyx was nice, but a little too quiet on weekdays, much better on Saturday night. We didn\u2019t go to Cherry as that\u2019s not our style but looked to be a happening place, even on weekdays. Rock\u2019s Lounge and the Sports Bar were both nice places to get a drink and the marguerita at Cabo was excellent. Pool: Our favorite part of RR. Truly a beautiful pool area, with lots of different pools and amazing lounge chairs. Spent a couple of days napping and reading by the pool. Never any problem getting a chair with space around you (Sunday and Monday, may be different on a Saturday). Waitress service was excellent, with a waitress there before you ever needed a drink. Service. Outstanding throughout the property, in all departments. My girlfriend commented continually how nice everyone was. I think this is where the difference between an 800 room hotel and a 3000+ room mega-resort really becomes clear. Check-In/Out: Very nice woman at the front desk (Angel). Room wasn\u2019t ready when we arrived (11am) but she checked us in and took our cell phone number. We received a call ~1pm that our room was ready and to pick-up keys at our convenience. Check-out through the TV was painless and was able to pick-up copy of bill at front desk on way out (no wait). Valet: Car was delivered within a couple of minutes each time, with A/C running and cool. Helpful and clear directions provided by the valet. Bell Desk: Bags were delivered within 5 minutes of calling down for them. Very helpful and knowledgeable bellman (Rich?) showed us our room and provided a wealth of local info. Good experience checking the bag as well, with two very nice bellmen to take our luggage while we waited for our room. Room Service: Ok, not great. Arrived with only one setting (silverware, glass of water, etc) despite telling them two were dining and ordering two meals. Forgot dipping sauce for chicken fingers, although they offered to return quickly with the missing item. Food was tasty if not gourmet. Tray sat in hallway a little longer then expected but was gone within a few hours. Overall, we were very impressed with the RR. This was a different Vegas than either of us had ever experienced, but one we can\u2019t wait to experience again in the future. Highly recommend, especially if you\u2019re looking to get away for a fun and relaxing (at least by Vegas standards!) couples trip.", "Date": "September 9, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Santa Barbara, CA", "Title": "\u201cBest Stay Ever!!!\u201d", "Author": "JenDSantaBarbara_CA", "ReviewID": "UR8536725", "Content": "My husband and I chose Red Rock for our anniversary after scoping out several different places in the Palm Desert and Sedona.

The pool area is littered with what appear to be beds . . . a novel idea by day, but after witnessing the spillover from the nightclubs at night, I dare say I'd want to go bleach myself after sitting on one of their lounges. Thumping music oozes out of every orifice of this hotel. This is not the place to go if you like to relax by the pool and read a book. Also, it was far too hot to hang out by the pool without shade, and shade was in short supply. If you want a spot with shade, head down early in the morning or get a private cabana ($$$$!!). The rooms were large and well appointed and the beds were very, very comfy. At least in your room you could turn off the music. The spa provided one of the best massages I have gotten. The spa was clean and had lots of options and the therapists were friendly and did a great job! The spa pool is where you want to go if you want shade and a quiet place to read. However, the highlight of our stay was clearly the food. I was with a group that was served at various functions so I expected the typical banquet food. I was tremendously surprised to find not only a huge variety of really nice foods, but they were all done well. Everything from the sandwich beside the pool to the multi-course dinners were delicious! We even visited the buffet one morning for brunch, expecting slightly better than average buffet food, and they even outdid that. The variety was absolutely overwhelmning, yet everything there was being served nicely (not icky looking buffet food) and was very, very good. This seems to be a foodie paradise--surrounded by good food, done very, very well. Casino, theatre and bowling alley all seemed average. They are all on-site so there is the convenience factor, but nothing about any of these wowed us.

Check in was quick and efficient, and they honored my request for a room on a high floor (17th floor). They also offered bottled water and apples. I love the decor of the Red Rock. It is artistic and plush- somewhat like THEHotel at Mandalay Bay, but not quite as dark. The hallway on our floor seemed to go on forever, and our room was quite a long walk from the elevator! The way the rooms are situated in the hallway are similar to that of The Signature at MGM. The door is in a small alcove across from another room. Each room has a doorbell and buttons you can push for \"do not disturb\" and maid service. When we entered the room, we were quite pleased! It was very large, with the same artistic vibe. 2 green lounge chairs with brown pillows, dark wood, a large flat screen tv, plush pillows on the bed, a large dresser/desk and minibar, and a big marble bathroom with a steam shower, his &her sinks, another flat screen tv, and a large tub. 2 robes were also provided for our use. We had a view of the Strip, but directly below us was a construction zone. The only noise we heard was from our neighbors. Nothing major, just like they were trying to move their luggage and it bumped the walls a few times. We didn't visit any of the restaurants, but ordered room service instead. Our order was taken very courteously and arrived in about 45 minutes. The presentation was wonderful! The food was delicious and hot- my husband got the Salt Lick bbq pulled pork sandwich and fries, and I got the make your own omelette with potatoes and a bagel. We split a slice of Italian Cheesecake for dessert- which was heavenly! Room service returned in about 1.5 hrs to take away the table. The bed was quite comfortable and the shower was refreshing- just hot enough and great pressure. There was even a scale in the bathroom so we could see how much damage we did from our meal. They provide a complimentary newspaper in the morning. I checked out quickly using the express checkout through the tv. We were sad to leave the Red Rock and have resolved to come back soon so we can try out some of the other ammenities such as the spa and pool.

We chose RR because we had just been to Vegas about 3 months ago where we stayed on strip (as always). We wanted something different and quieter than the strip environment. From the moment we arrived in the airport we knew we made the right choice. Even the airport was a zoo. We easily got a rental car and off we went to RR, which was an easy 15 min drive or so. Checking in was one of the only confusing parts of the trip as there were no good signs around showing where the lobby or check in was, especially not from the parking garage. We of course found check in grabbed some complimentary bottled water and apples and were up to our room. We requested a high up canyon view as I heard the noise from the cherry lounge could be loud on the lower floors. We were on floor 7 and I would say the view was fair-good. There is some construction so we had a view of the pool, dirt/construction area and the canyon off in the background. I would highly recommend asking for a room close to the elevator. We were towards the end of the hall and it took about 1 1/2 mins to walk to the elevator. Why aren't the elevators in the middle?? There was also some bumping noise from the bar, it wasn't that bad, but it was there-so make sure you ask to be higher up if you are concerned. But the room was really nice, probably close to as nice as Wynn, and the bed was super comfy!! The casino has all your games and slots. The poker room is very nice and has lots of locals. The dealers were very nice and laid back. The only thing about the casino is that it's done in a circle so it takes a while to figure out where you are and where you're going. By the end of the trip I was remembering where good slots were by remembering what restaurants they were facing. Other than that I could never find anything. There were locals and tourists here, you will find a mix of everything. Yes there were kids, older people and lots of young people, too. I think everyone felt comfortable there. The pool is really nice. Comfy chairs, good drink service, very clean. There is a main pool area with a fun fountain for the kids and then lots of smaller pools behind it. It can be very private and where we were there were no kids. There is also a pool at the spa which I would highly recommend as no one uses it. Just walk into the spa-go through the fitness room and you'll have your own pool with service, beds, everything. We loved it. I did use the spa and it was among the best I've been to. Very nice facilites and my treatment was wonderful. The fitness room is also very nice with good machines and weights. I don't have too much to say about the food. We had room service twice and it was fine. It wasn't great, but it was just breakfast room service. Took a long time I thought, about an hour and was a little cold. We also ate at the 24 hour cafe and it was fine for sandwiches, pizza. The only fairly nice food we ate there was the mexican restaraunt and we enjoyed it. Good guacamole, good service and great drinks. The nice restaurants looked good and were very full, the new japanese restaurant looks great. There is also a bowling alley which we did not use, but we did see a movie-it's so fun that there is a theatre right there, just walk through the casino/food court and you can take a break with a movie! Because we were off strip it was so nice to just relax and enjoy. We didn't feel like we had to go to another casino or go see anything. We did go to the strip one day and it was an easy short drive. Also note that Rosemary's restaurant (one of the top in Vegas) is very close to RR resort. I am a big fan of staying at Wynn when we go to Vegas, but I think we will switch to RR from now on.

We woke up pretty early, around 9:30 every morning and got to the pool around 10. By getting there early and with the help of the cute pool girls, we were able to get two great lounge chairs with an umbrella to fight off the hot vegas sun each day. We sat by the pools in the back of the complex because the main pool was crowded with kids. The back had a much more relaxed spa vacation feel. We ate at Cabo and Terra Rosa which were both great.

Clean, very nice pool area, spacious casino layout, great bingo room, bowling alleys, 16 theater movies on site along with fast food alternatives. Good place to bring family and just let them run. No need to leave the property which is rare in a remote location. Staff defenitely needs lessons in courtesy and understand we are their customers. They were cold and had attitude. Especially in the gaming pits. I was playing craps at a $5 table and a gal at one end of the table was throwing the dice a bit hard and one bounced off the table. On the one hand, she was told to make sure the dice hit the end of the long table, yet chided on her first attempt (ever) for throwing them too hard. Craps is intimidating to a first time player anyway without criticism. Dice moved to a guy next to me and again, he threw a bit too hard and one hopped over the table and a pit guy had to pick it up and scolded him, angrily... rather than instructing him or teaching him how to do it properly. Next couple of rolls were perfect. Then on the next roll, his pace was good, but one die hit the point puck and took a bad hop off the table. The pit guy chased down the die off the floor again but returned to the table enraged, yelling at this poor guy who had no malicious intent at all. So I speak up saying, \"Hey, he didn't throw it too hard, it just took a bad hop off the puck.\" Well, at this point he became unglued... \"Oh I see, and now you run the casino! I've got better things to do than chase dice around the floor all day.\" He was really pissed. I immediately took my bets down, except for the pass line which you can't. The shooter made his point, I got paid and left the table thinking this place [--]. It's a $5 starter table and people need to be taught, not yelled at. At a minimum, they should be made to feel welcome. If this guy has anger management issues, he should watch over the $25 minimum table instead. I joined my wife for a drink in the bar and the service was cold, merely took the order and served it up. No thank you, no how's your day going, nothing. We felt as if we were an inconvenience for ordering a drink. It was only 4:30 in the afternoon. I might understand if it were crowded. The property is amazing, too bad the people aren't and in the end, that makes or breaks a place. I'll give it one more shot on my next visit, but if I have a similar experience, I'll never return to it, nor one of their properties. Play downtown at Golden Nugget or on the strip at Harrah's, Bally's and your welcomed to the table, treated with respect. If it were my company, I'd fire this guy on the spot.

The gym was very nicely appointed as well. Well worth the resort fee. We went to the bowling alley one night, non-smoking and very clean. What a great time we had!! They have a 13 theater movie complex on-site as well. It did draw in some local riff-raff teenagers but were easy enough to ignore.

Sooooo glad we did. First off, compare Expedia prices with the hotel site. With the package deals on their site, saved about $100 PLUS got free breakfast. The overall atmosphere is cool/hip, not tacky OTT Vegas. The room looked exactly like it did in the photos and was bigger than predicted. The pool area was great but very little shade so sun block and mojitos were in order. It was fairly mellow on Friday and Monday but Saturday/Sunday was a \"pool party\" and the volume of the music was not great for relaxing/chatting/reading. The solution? As a hotel guest you get full access to the spa facilities which includes a small pool with lounging area. You still hear the music, etc. but was just a bit more mellow. I don't think other guests knew or thought to go there because we almost had it to ourselves. Food options? Salt Lick was mediocre. Terra Rossa was great (ask to sit on the small patio - it wasn't too hot in the evening and so was really chilled, almost romantic). The cocktail lounge with the fire pit at the back of TBones was great as well. We rented a car so can't vouch for the shuttle service but it was about 15-20 min to the strip. Highly recommend renting bikes and touring through Red Rock canyon. It's a 6 mile ride from the hotel and then a 14 mile loop. First 5miles of the loop are uphill but the view is worth the effort if you can do it. Also head out early if doing it at this time of year e.g. around 7am.

As far as those negative reviews, I wondered more than once if I were at the same place they went to. I read them before my trip and got a bit nervous, but as I was going to a small conference there, I was going anyhow. I am very pleased to report that they couldn't have been farther from my experience. I related the reviews to several others that went and they found it hard to believe they were true. You've read elsewhere about the facilities - top notch. I won't go into them much except to say they were as nice as the website portrays. Sorta South Beach meets the Ritz. One of my colleagues mentioned that the hotel was more like a nightclub than hotel in feel. The entire place was quite upscale in look and feel. The pool was equally cool - particularly the adults-only Cherry Pool. More on that below. Back to the service.... From the moment we arrived, service was stellar. The valet relayed our name via radio to the staff (unnoticed by me) and we were greeted by name all the way to the front desk, including the guy at the front door, the manager standing in the lobby, and the desk clerk. Nice touch. The service continued all the way through the place - from the dealers to the wait staff, the maids and even people we simply walked past throughout the property. The second day of our conference, I rented a cabana at the Cherry Pool so the wives could all hang out while we were off conferencing. We figured it would pay off as the girls intended to spend the day down at the pool. I went down in the am where Blair introduced herself, let me pick out a cabana, and told me to simply have the ladies say hi when they showed up. At break, I came down to see how they were doing and my wife simply said \"I feel like a rock star\", and how attentive both Blair and Jennifer (who came on later) were. Scored some points with the wife there! When my wife closed out at the end of the day, there was an issue with the bill as we had apparently been quoted the wrong price by reservations. After some brief discussion, it was handled in our favor and all was well (thanks Chris). We had such a good time down there, and they treated us so well that I rented the cabana the second day (at the correct price this time), and proceeded to use it as a \"meeting place\" to demo products to people I met at the conference (we were exhibitors). This was not a normal thing to do down there, but the staff was willing to accomodate us with \"whatever we need\" (thanks again Chris). What more could one ask for? The second day, the girls took EXCELLENT care of us again (Blair and Katrina I believe). Granted we spent a fair amount of money this time around (buy drinks for 20 people or so over a couple hour period and its bound to happen), but even on the first day where we didn't, they treated us great. My dad overheard someone say \"I feel like I am in a movie\". How cool is that? Oh - and it was quite successful from a marketing standpoint too I think. As if that kind of service wasn't outstanding enough, when we surprised the TBonz staff with a group of nine for dinner and no reservations (at 7:30pm no less), they accomodated us in minutes (one cocktail) by opening up a private room. Service was stellar there too, as was the food. Note: big portions - split side dishes. Very fine dining experience. Others that were at the conference mentioned that the Mexican restaurant was good. We also enjoyed breakfast at the Grand Cafe - great fruit plate. I gambled a bit the first night I was there - craps and roulette. Dealers were friendly and courteous, cocktail service was decent. If you are bringing kids, you will be pleased with the plethora of things for them to do too. Other than the incredible pool setup, I also walked past some sort of \"discovery zone\" area near the food court, and an arcade. There is bowling and a movie theatre there too. I didn't have any kids there but one of the wives said that the movie theatre was very nice, although it appeared that there were only a few movies as two were in multiple theatres. All in all, my wife, my family, my business colleagues, etc. all had a blast. We all felt it was spectacular and cannot wait to go back - we demanded (begged) that the conference be there again next year. For reference, I travel some 15-20 weeks of the year for work, and try to do 3-4 vacation trips a year (including weekend getaways). We typically target lower priced hotels (i.e. Red Roof or Comfort/Sleep Inn) when on business and better hotels (i.e. Courtyards or better) when on vacation. This stay was nicer than virtually any hotel I ever stayed in, including the very upscale Manhattan hotels I stayed at in a \"previous life\". If I were to look for negatives, I felt that the business center was overpriced. But then again I own a pretty small business without the marketing budgets of other companies. Also, there is an Office Depot across the street which I found very useful, convenient, and comparatively inexpensive.

Seperate shower and tub with a 20 inch plasma at the foot of the tub. Room has a safe and plenty of cloths storage for a week or more stay. POOL: The pool is great. It has a row of lounges in the pool. The service at the pool is fast and efficient. They are expanding the pool to triple its size. I would get a bit packed on the weekends and seating was hard to find after 10:00am but with the additional space that won't be a problem. They had black jack tables at the pool.

We caught the Noon complimentary shuttle from the airport to the hotel very easily and found no fault. The check in was a breeze, and the front desk associate was pleasantly helpful. He made us aware of the \"Cherry Nightclub\" and how it can become louder at night and suggested a room on a higher floor and on Strip side for us, which we oblidged. He also indicated that our room was far down from the elevator - which is was, but we didnt mind a walk. It makes a difference when the clerk atleast alerts you of these things and gives you the option to make different arrangements, we were very happy to receive this service and hope they keep it up.

However, we did very well with black jack and roulette. Players cards get you discounted meal at the Feast Buffet - which we recommend. Definetely \"not your Mother's\" Vegas Buffet. Amazing variety, and very nice atmosphere. Grand Cafe was average, take it or leave it. And the Food court with the Burrito place is GREAT!

RRR was wonderful - the environment was classy and relaxing, not gaudy like so much else in LV. The service was generally very good, and it is worth valet parking (they apparently don't have a charge except for tips.) I did not experience problems with service that other people complained about on here. The rooms are beautiful. The bottled water available in the rooms is overpriced, of course, but you can get free bottled water in the Spa (which all guests may use free of charge). The main pool is nice with a party atmosphere and lots of cool places to lounge. I prefered the more tranquil Spa pool. The Spa itself was gorgeous and you can get free water, juice, tea, granola bars, and fruit in there. We did a couple's massage, and my masseuse, Michael, was great. (I recommend him.) The business center is overpriced and has short hours. Restaurants: T-Bones was very good, but way over-priced. They give you huge portions of food, and we would have been better off splitting an entree. (Would have been reasonably priced if we had done this.) The Grand Cafe was great for breakfast, and has a nice bagel with salmon & capers. The Italian place is good for dinner, but you should make a reservation. (We split an appetizer, pasta course, and entree and it was more than enough food.) The oyster bar place has good oysters (of course) and we had a great etoufee there.

Other: There is a movie theatre, a cool bowling alley, and some sort of kids club in the hotel. It is about a 30 minute drive into downtown LV. The road does have heavy traffic and lots of lights, and is not a carefree drive. Parking is free and ample at the downtown LV hotels though. RRR would be inconvenient if your main thing is going to downtown LV, but since we only were doing this on a few nights to see shows, it was fine.

On the first morning, I waited 20 minutes, after being seated, for someone to take my order; the food took another 20 minutes to arrive. The second morning was maybe 5 minutes faster overall. I used the Business Center computer to print a one page boarding pass; I was charged $5.89 (I don't know how they decided that was the number). Every other hotel I have ever stayed at charges nothing. Ouch. This hotel is very isolated from The Strip and any other dining or entertainment option.

There are plenty of excellent places to eat and the casino is very nice, although trying to find a low limit table is a little tough. There are movie theatres, and they were in the process of building a bowling alley, which may now be complete. The rooms at the Red Rock are gorgeous. The beds are very comfortable, and the soaking tub is a dream come true (it has a small flat screen tv to watch!). The bathroom is all marble, big, and again, beautiful. There is a large flat screen TV, but as usual in Vegas they try to rip you off for internet service. There looks to be a fantastic pool area, although it was windy and cold when we were there so we did not get to try it out. There also some fun nightclubs. One drawback we had at the resort was upon our arrival. We arrived at 2pm, which is a little early for check in, but usually there will be something available. But not this time. We waited until nearly 4pm for the room to be ready. This was on a weekday arrival. At least they had a nice big lobby to hold up in. I would recommend a stay at the Red Rock if you can get the rate that we found (under 150), or if you\u2019re just splurging on a special occasion, but for the frequent visitor (non-high roller) like us it\u2019s kind of pricey.

This place is currently the locals favorite place to gamble at. The food at the chop house was one of the best meals that we have ever eatten, the buffet was great with more quility food then I have seen at one of these. No smoke in the casino, The pool looks great, with a bar and card games right next to it. Not a huge swimming pool but nice for wadding or letting the kids play in it (we didnt see many kids at the hotel). The staff was super nice all around. This is not a budget hotel so if your shopping for price pick some place else, from what we saw of the other hotels this place is about as good as it gets and the price is still close to lots of the lower class/run down 4 to 5 star places.(We walked through all of the other hotels in this class except the wynn) We took the pink jeep tour to the grand cannon and flew down in the helicopter if ,you want to see some great places ask for chris. The only thing to keep in mind is that they are still working on new parts of the hotel and there are other projects being built all around this area. This goes for any place in Vegas that has open land to be built on. Just dont let any of this distract your great view of the mountains. If you think its better near the strip just ask someone that been to Vegas about that because the strip is jam packed with taxis, people and plenty of construction or run down buildings to look at. The only slightly bad comment We had on the Red rock was the transportation. The shuttles only run every 1-2 hrs to the airport and near the strip with only enough room to hold about 12 people(So you have to wait in a line durring prime time to hold a spot for the ride you want(if its full you have another 2 hr wait,and thats if theres any more runs). If you dont have a car and plan to be comming and going to the strip this may be a problem. We picked this hotel because we wanted to hang at the pool, hike and relax a big chunk of our Vacation. So if you want a wild party and to hang at the strip every day pick the Bellagio or ceasars, heard the wynn is really upper end too but didnt go in so cant say for sure.

We parked in valet, grabbed our luggage out of the car, and headed towards the wall of RED glass doors. The decor inside the resort was rich and dark. Our check-in went smoothly. We strolled over to the elevators, put our card in the slot to summon an elevator, entered, and rode to the 11th floor. The floors were carpeted in warm stripes, the walls white, the overhead lights draped in red fabric. Our room, 2 queen beds with Canyon View, was luxurious. The bathroom walls were lined in brown leather. The black & white marble tub was deep with a flat-screen t.v. mounted above the faucets for easy viewing. Twin sinks, lighted vanity mirror, scale, bathrobes, q-tips, lush towels, nothing was overlooked. The closet light turned on automatically when the door was opened. Padded and wooden hangers awaited our clothing. The queen beds were large with 4 sleeping pillows and 3 or 4 decorative pillows each. The mini-bar was stocked with Italian bottled waters, sodas, liquors, candies, even cookies, a disposable camera, a first-aid kit, and a sex-aid kit! A printed notice warned that items removed from the display tray for 45 seconds would be charged to your room! Look, but don't touch. We had a large, flatscreen t.v. to watch from our beds, but only turned it on once. The Red Rock Canyon view was gorgeous, and the pool below was amazing! A very large, round pool with a fountain in the center and plenty of oversized lounge chairs and beds surrounding the pool. After dropping off our bags, we headed downstairs to get a bite to eat before bed. The Grand Cafe is open 24 hours, and it fit our needs perfectly. My sister had a very thin crust pepperoni pizza that promised basil but the waitress warned they had no basil. I had a bowl of lentil soup and fresh crusty bread, a mini loaf in it's own mini bag. We awoke early the following morning. Our spa appointments weren't until 10am, so we headed downstairs for breakfast. The Grand Cafe greeted us for the 2nd time in less than 7 hours. My sister ordered an apple pie ala mode, but alas, their pies hadn't yet been delivered that day. The waitress offered cream pies, but we both settled on a skillet breakfast: 3 eggs over easy / over medium, bacon, sourdough toast, and hashbrowns. Delicious!! Next we walked the casino floor, stopping at a craps table. I quickly lost $100. We went back to our room to get ready for our spa treatments. Grabbed our swimsuits to kill some time in the whirlpool, and hairclips to keep our tresses up. We rode the elevator down to the spa, and entered the tall, glass, red doors to the spa. We signed in, and were led to the women's spa area. We were provided lockers, sandals and robes. Bottled water was within reach nearly everywhere. We soaked in the whirlpool for about 20 minutes, then headed over to the lounge to await our masseuses. Michael called out my name, and I was off. Nice dark room, relaxing music, warm sheet & towels on the table. Perfect! Michael was very gentle and had very soft hands. In talking, I learned he has been at the Red Rock Resort for 1 year, but with Station Casinos for 5 years. He's excellent and I'd recommend him to anyone. After 50 minutes, my massage was through. I headed back to the lounge, drank more water, and waited for my facial. Vicki was my facial technician (I'm not sure of the exact term or title). I had never had a facial before which really excited her. She explained ahead of time everything that she would do, then was quiet the rest of the procedure. That was perfect, allowing me to actually doze some of the time! The facial surprisingly came with feet & hand treatments. After our facials, we headed up to the casino's food court. We had Panda Express and Fatburger. My masseuse, Michael, had recommended the Baby Burger, but when I got there, I was told the Baby Burger Buns hadn't been delivered. They could make my Baby Burger but serve it on a Fat Burger Bun. Fine. A side of \"Skinny fries\" and a diet coke, and I was all set. The burger was delicious, very much like an In-N-Out burger! Back to the spa we went for our 2pm appointment, manicures. My sister's manicurist was awesome, a bubbly blonde named Lori. My manicurist was named Bonnie. She didn't speak much, not even to tell me what products she was putting on my hands (there were several small dishes of creams). Regardless, my nails look fantastic with a gorgeous light shade of pink. Next were our champagne pedicures! We got into the pedicure lounge chairs. There were supposed to \"massage\", but mine just vibrated, so I turned that feature off. This was another quiet treatment, this time with a seaweed wrap and caviar cream on my tootsies (I learned from listening to Lori). Our pedi's looked great! For dinner, we headed to T-Bones steak house for dinner, and were promptly seated near a loooonnnng gas fireplace. It was really impressive! Kirsten, Rick and _____ (sorry, I forgot his name!) were our servers. Kirsten told us of all the specials, told us of her favorites, and really made everything sound so tasty! We ordered a bottle of wine... a German Riesling. It was DELICIOUS!!! For an appetizer, we had Oysters Rockefeller. They had a minty flavor, and were COLD. We were shocked & discusted by our first bite, but graciously tried to eat two. Couldn't finish the plate, and it was obvious something was wrong. When Kirsten pointed out we still had oysters to finish, we had to confess they just didn't taste good to us. She apologized and removed the charge from our bill. Our entrees were Surf & Turf, and thankfully the steak and lobster were so good they made up for the discusting oysters. Our side dishes were o.k. The petite filet and lobster really were the stars of the show. The mac n' cheese side dish was not your mama's mac n' cheese. The cheese was white. White cheddar? No... gorgonzolla. Pew! Actually, the first bite was stinky, but it aged into the delicious creamy taste & texture as the night went on, and I had 3 servings of it! The other side dish was garlic mashed potatoes. They merely sprinkled some garlic on top, torched it, and served it. The garlic really should have been incorporated throughout the mashed potatoes, in our opinion. Now the topper. We asked for dessert to go. It was a triple chocolate cake. They said, sure, no problem. Cut it, boxed it, and put it in a bag. Off we went to our room, opened the cake (which looked glorious), and ... where are the forks? We went back down to the restaurant to request forks. The young lady at the front desk said they did not have disposable silverware, that she had been after them to order some, but they had none for us. As we stood there dumbfounded, the portly balding man next to her (also behind the counter) said, \"Room Service\", to which the girl responded, \"You could call room service and ask for a fork\". Off we went, no thanks to them! We walked over to the food court and \"borrowed\" a spoon from Ben & Jerry (Thanks B & J!!!). We strolled past the craps tables. Two tables had now raised their minimum bet to $10... too pricey for me. The $5. table was dead. So I played $20 worth of video poker. Bye $20. Back to Ben & Jerry's we went to get 2 scoops of ice cream, then back to our room to enjoy our desserts. The next morning we had 10am hair appointments. The stylists were having a meeting about new products, so they ran a bit late, but soon we were seated at the washing stations. My stylist was Michelle, and I think my sister's was named Anika. Anika wasn't much of a talker, but Michelle was very nice and made me feel right at home. She did a great job on my hair. Trimmed it, blew it out... looked fantastic.

We requested a room away from any noise but with a view of the Strip. We opened the 18th floor door to the most beautiful view of the mountains and the Strip. The hotel design continued thru out the room. Unbelieveable! One warning, don't touch anything in refrig. Everything from soda, peanut, etc. is on a sensor and if it leaves its spot for 45 seconds...Bingo Baby, your charged. Loved the LCD TV attached to the bathtub room wall. The picture wasn't as good as the bedroom's HUGE LCD screen. The restaurants and fast food had high quality food. We did have HORRIBLE service at the Italian restaurant...finally complained ... we had to wait over 30 minutes for our food. Even our waiter was embarassed. Reward for our patience was... a half of glass of champagne :(((. To top off that evening. The diners next to us was an old man, definitely drunk, with a 20 year old hooker with him. He had an awful mouth on him. The manager finally came over and ask them to leave after everyone around complained. Would never eat there AGAIN and don't recommend it.! Highly recommend T-bones for a special occasion. High priced, items are bought on an individual price. Food was EXCELLENT. We had four waiters waiting on us. Salt Lick BBQ was good as well as CABO for Mexican. Fast food places were Rubios, Panda Express, a hamburger place and deli. Also had Baskin-Robbins and Starbucks. The casino exceptionally clean and definitely catered to locals. Had 1, 5, 10 cents slots. Poker room was VERY crowded and often had to wait for a table. Many locals play there. The pool area was once again, absolutely high class. Cabanas and lounge chairs with 5 inch thick pads. My husband did say the pool was quite chlorinated. Took two massages...welll, what can I say. Gym is upscale. We did not miss the excitement of the Strip and can hardly wait to return very soon. we've stayed at Mandalay, Bellagio and Caesar's and have paid up to $400/night.

We ate at Tides Oyster Bar and had the freshest oysters we've had in a very long time. They also have the BEST banana cream pie ANYWHERE! The waitress was very personable and helpful with menu selections. The next night we ate at TBones Steak House. The food was delicious, and like all steakhouses, the servings and the bill were huge. However, the service was very impersonal. We had a \"team\" of 3 servers and they all were unkempt looking (not clean shaven, shirts rumpled and half tucked in, not very refined). They basically just put the food on the table. No help with menu or wine selection, just order takers. When we go to nice restaurants, we like to feel special, and we did not at TBones. If that's not important to you and you're just wanting good food, this place is great. If you're looking for an overall special experience, look elsewhere. The casino was great. Excellent variety of machines, never too crowded and contrary to other trip reports, I won $500 throughout the weekend, on penny, nickel and quarter machines!

I've read reviews with issues about the service, noise, etc., but I didn't run into any problems. I arrived at the Vegas airport at a time when I would have had to wait about 90 minutes for the free shuttle to the hotel (runs every 2 hours). So I took a cab. Cab fare was about $50 including tip during rush hour. Took the shuttle back from the hotel to the airport a few days later. Shuttle was on time and a nice ride. Upon arriving, check-in was easy. Requested a room as far away from the club as possible since I had read reviews about the bass from the club all night. Received a king room on the 18th floor with a strip view. Never heard the club at all. The strip was quite a distance away, but the lights were cool at night. This side of the hotel also had a view of the construction still going on below. These guys start before sunrise! Could hear them hammering away at around 530am. But I don't think it would have been loud enough to wake me up. I was already up because I was still on east coast time. Of course, I was on the 18th floor and if I had a room down lower, the noise probably would have bothered me. The room was terrific. Nice king bed in the center of the room with two chairs, nightstands, Bose Wave radio, desk, floor to ceiling window. The bathroom had marble tile, two sinks, separate sunken tub and shower and a separate door to the commode. The little LCD TV over the sunken tub was a nice touch. The 42\" plasma TV in the room was cool, but the reception was typical of hotels - poor. So the picture was that much more grainy on a big screen. Conference areas, lobby, casino area were all very nice. Didn't gamble, but walked through to go to the Italian restaurant (this is the one that is run by the winner of Hell's Kitchen). Had to try the seabass that was her claim to fame on the show and it was absolutely outstanding. For $32, it had better be. Prices for everything else were much more reasonable. Pastas were in the $10 range or so. Not too bad. Transportation to the strip ended at 3pm from the Red Rock. Makes sense that they want you to stay at their location to lose your money. Didn't get a chance to check out the club or any shows while I visited there. All in all, this was probably one of the nicest hotels I've visited. Got a group rate for the conference of $200/night plus the resort fee of $20 which doesn't include internet of another $13/day. Good thing I was able to expense it. Otherwise, I probably wouldn't stay there again because of the price and distance to the strip. If traveling to Vegas to party and hit the town, this is probably not the best place to be unless renting a car or taking cabs works for you.

Nice hotel, nice view if you're on the valley side. Rooms are very nice. Not as big as The Hotel at Mandalay Bay which is where we usally stay. The bathroom countertop, while holding two sinks, is not very deep. Therefore, there's not much room to put your stuff. Towel bars are on the front of the sinks just below waist level, so you're always knocking them onto the floor. Strange spot for towels. Request for non-feather pillows and bedspread were filled promptly. However, one of the sinks did not drain at all because the stopper was broken in the down position. Our request to have this fixed was not responded to for our entire stay. His and her reading lights on the bed were a nice touch, as was the Bose Wave Radio on the nightstand. The hotel was very clean. The casino was laid out almost exactly like Green Valley Ranch (e.g. circular design). Unfortunately, the casino was relatively smokey on an otherwise slow weekend. Compared to other strip casinos with higher ceilings, the casino was smokier than average. Huge poker room with a very alluring Jumbo Jackpot feature for bad beats. Every player in each of the 9 Station Casino poker rooms gets paid a minimum of $200 when the Jackpot is triggered (i.e. getting beat when you have 4 nines or better). Unfortunately, all of the blackjack tables require the dealer to hit on soft 17 which increases the house advantage. Players are allowed to touch the cards in blackjack which is not the norm in most strip casinos. Dealers were all very friendly. Restaurants were above average. We had nice meals at Cabo and T-Bones. Cabo had excellent Mexican food. Red Rock Canyon is only 5 miles up the road and offers absolutely breathtaking views. There is a 13 mile car loop that costs $5 to access. With little doubt, the best deal in Vegas. Highly reccomended. The Spa, while very nice, is on par with other larger strip hotels. No individual lock boxes for valuables, so leave them in the room-safe when heading down to the spa.

Getting to Red Rock from the airport and the Strip is a breeze now that the southern and western portions of the Las Vegas Beltway (Route 215) are completed and reach as far as West Charleston Blvd. where the exit to the hotel is, a 15 to 25 minute drive. The property is beautifully located near Red Rock Canyon in the Summerlin area and is a nice and quiet alternative to the hustle and bustle of downtown or the Strip. Now the hotel itself. The check-in process was a little strained. When travelling to Las Vegas, I travel with someone (who is in her 70s) who prefers a room away from elevators and vending machines. The clerk initially gave us a room on the 12th floor (room 12-102) closest to the elevator, and as I would see later on, it would've been fine based on the floorplan. She then gave us a room on the 16th floor (room 16-140), which we took. Based on our request, and whether her actions were to comply or to be downright mean, the clerk sure knew what she was doing. When we got up to the 16th floor, we walked. And walked. And walked. Because the rooms are so big, the corridors are long, so a casual walk from the room to the elevator took over a minute. Because of our long trip, the comfortable room, and In lieu of playing 'musical rooms', we opted to stay where we were. But the clerk certainly could've put us halfway closer. Now our baggage. We drove into the hotel's valet and used the bell service and everything seemed okay. Then the bell captain gave our stub to the hotel clerk. We get to our room, a whole hour passes by, and still no baggage. Several phone calls later, our baggage appears with apologies from the bellman. It wasn't his fault, this was the fault of the hotel clerk, whose actions were either accidental or intentional. And while I'm on the subject of the hotel clerks at Red Rock, their overall demeanor seems somewhat hardened. The check-in process should be relaxed, friendly and professional, not a clearance of customs to enter North Korea. The rooms are very comfortable, with wonderful amenities like the flat-screen TV, the Bose radio at the bedside and the comfortable bedding. Beware of touching or moving anything in the minibar - the minifridge or the outside tray of goodies - or you'll automatically be charged. The TV in our nice spacious bathroom didn't work, and the construction outside the hotel in the morning didn't really faze us. We did most of our dining at the buffet and found the food to be quite tasty. The gambling wasn't great in terms of winning, but then you can't expect to come to Vegas expecting to win. Overall, in spite of the minor glitches, we were quite pleased with our stay. But then again, we were comped for four nights.

What happened to customer service and just doing what guests expect? While all problems were handled, I had to wrangle my satisfaction out of the front desk staff, which appear to have been hardened by other unhappy guests. They were well-rehearsed in how to handle guest objections. The most pleasant staff to deal with were the housekeepers (despite overlooking cleaning my room one day) and the concierge (all very professional). Convention services staff did try hard. Food service was well above average for a convention hotel. However, meals were not timed well and some people received their entrees when others had finished. Water replenishment during seminars was frequently noisy. Yet the convention staff were very responsive and accommodating, if not always able to anticipate the needs of our group.

It was quite a trek from the elevators to my room about midway down the hall. Rooms at the end of the hall should be for marathon runners! The only remaining problem service-wise is housekeeping. They are obviously short-staffed leading to careless cleaning. On this occasion, I checked in very late (almost midnight.)

A robe, hanging on a hook in the bath was obviously used by a woman who was still of childbearing age if you get my drift. Grossed me out.

I was thrilled with the fact that turn down service included turning our stereo to a wonderful jazz station, turning down the bed, and even leaving a note about what the weather would be like the next day...including what time the sun would rise and set!!! The construction for us was not a huge concern, maybe we just arrived on a slow time, yes there was a crane blocking our view of the strip but honestly, it was very hazy, and if you want a view of the strip, stay on the strip! Ate dinner at the buffet every morning..it's a buffet. Food was okay but our service on Friday morning was top notch. Our waitress gave us great recommendations and little hints about the hotel. Went to Terra Rosa for dinner Saturday night...highly recommend it, and make use of the staff in regards to the wine list, very knowledgeable. Spend time exploring alll of the property...the pool area is awesome and all sort of great places to people watch on the weekends. Tbones has a fantastic outdoor fire pit and bar area that was a wonderful cozy place for intimate conversation with new friends. Our entire experience was top notch...I am thrilled with our stay and cannot wait to go back. Awesome staff, great service, and a entire hotel there for whatever we needed!", "Date": "November 16, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pasadena", "Title": "\u201cKnow Before You Go!\u201d", "Author": "WeTryItOnce", "ReviewID": "UR6107794", "Content": "We went to this Resort after reading and understanding what to expect. Yes, it is true that the Resort is in a phase to complete the second half of it's room capacity. Yes, it is also true that you can expect construction noises as early as 7AM, temporary walls, black plastic partitions at the end of your floor, and workers on scaffolds. Construction on the rooms and Spa is planned for completion by July of 2007. This could all be a disappointment if you went to the resort to sit and watch the plasma screen in your room. We went to see Red Rock Canyon, Mt. Charleston, the Valley of Fire, see Shows on the Strip and as many hotels as we could, and of course use the on premise Spa every day. The on site Night Club Cherry is Co-owned by Geo Clooney (who is often spotted there) and is complete with a clothing optional outdoor pool/deck only accessible through the 10PM opening nightclub. The beds were superb as was the service, but keep in mind that even though this resort is 15 -20 from the Strip, it is still Vegas and 'tips' keep things moving, create opportunities, and increases your learning curve of the property. I learned that by the second week in November, every year, Las Vegas lays off approximately 30% of its workforce. Keep it all in stride when you order drinks at the pool and it takes awhile to get service. This is truly a beautiful property, admitted by management to have some flaws, but a pleasant experience for a traveller who demands a smoke-free room. Some rooms may have a door to make an adjoining room accessible for perhaps a family. If you are travelling alone and don't want to hear the next room's conversation, ask to be moved to a different room.", "Date": "November 11, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hollywood", "Title": "\u201cThe Casino is Great!\u201d", "Author": "FrediFizzx", "ReviewID": "UR6104878", "Content": "What can I say?

The next issue came with the fact that they are still building the second tower and there are ribrations and excessive noise through out the day that makes utilizing the room almost impossible. When the issue was given to the front desk, they said that they would be able to move us the following day (it was currently after 3pm that day) and I would be notified when it was available. I was NEVER notified and had to seek out information all day (10am, noon and 3pm) to the point that we finally went to dinner and were moved to the new room at 10pm!

If you like contemporary, hip surroundings, this is a wonderful choice. The major drawbacks are: #1 As of Oct. 06, they are still building what looks like the other half of the hotel. Construction begins at 7am (not 9 as I was told by the front desk), goes until 5 and is LOUD! Imagine drilling that rattles the building! They originally put us in a room at the end of the hall (the next half of the hallway was visqueened (plastic) off). When I complained they moved us closer to the elevators but you could still hear the drilling and hammering during the day. Our last morning, they hit the hot water pipes so no shower to be had. Typical construction issues. #2 You are WAAAYYY out there! It's a $35-$40 cab fare to the strip. Not convenient if you want to go into town for an evening's dinner or show. Other than that, they have really done a nice job with the details. Beautiful contemporary furnishings and bathroom. Comfy beds. Besides the construction, noise level from other guests is low (except maybe from adjoining doors). Fresh Flowers everywhere. Fun pool. Hip bars (I think one is a Randy Gerber club) Great restaurants. Helpful, friendly staff. The casino is not smokey yet but who knows what will happen when they get more business We ate at TBones and had a wonderful steak for dinner. Lots of places to hang out and people watch. A nice touch is that the spa facilities and gym are incuded in your resort fee even if you are not having a treatment that day. BEAUTIFUL spa!

We are not gamblers or smokers so Vegas was not our first choice of places to visit but we had to go for business reasons. We arrived on Saturday night. When we first went to our \"non smoking room\" it was very smokey smelling. Since it was late and we were tired we didn't complain. The next morning the maid apparantly spayed the room to try to clean it and it was better. We walked through the casino to find a restaurant and it was very very smokey and very crowded. My first impression was not good. I do have to say that things got better after that. It seems like Saturday night is the busiest night with the smoke and noise. The rest of the week we hardly noticed it. ROOMS: The rooms are big and comfy. The decor is very relaxing and we had a great view of the pool and the mountains in the background. Don't be fooled by the pictures on the website because you can see the mountains but they aren't as close as they look on the website. The pool area looks great at night when it's all lite up and it closes early so we didn't get any noise. The beds are very comfy (even better than the famous 4 Seasons beds) complete with lots of pillows and down duvets. The bathroom is amazing with the deep soaker tub and tv. SPA: Most people don't realize that the spa has many free things for the hotels guests. The exercise room with lots of very good equipment and a boxing ring, lockers and showers, a lap pool, hot tub/whirlpool, cold pool, sauna, fruit, juices and water. Even if you don't want to use the equipment, it's worth it to go and see the beautiful decor. FOOD: We ate at all the restaurants (except the buffet) and they were very good. The swordfish at Terra Rosa is the best. SERVICE: 95% of the staff were very accommodating and friendly. The pool staff, front desk staff, houskeeping and spa staff were great. 2 out of the 3 people working at the conseiger(sp?) desk weren't very helpful. Maybe you have to tip largely to get them to look up the info you want. If they didn't have an answer they just said they didn't know. Usually, they offer to find out for you but not here. POOL: On the weekend the pool area had a lot of kids (during the week it was very quiet). Most of the pool furniture is not adjustable and is comfy for laying down but not for sitting up and reading. They have round beds around the pool which you can use for free but the square ones you have to pay for. Most people found it a little confusing which areas were free and which you had to reserve and pay for. Ask the pool staff on your first day because there is a small area with adjustable loungers that are free. LOCATION: If you are a gambler and want to spend a lot of time on the strip this is not the place for you because it takes 1/2 hour to get to the strip. If you want a relaxing place away from the strip this is the perfect location. We loved the location because it was only 2 miles away from Red Rock canyon (cycling is great there). You feel like you are at an relaxing mountain retreat instead of in the middle of the hustle and bustle and bright lights of Vegas. This will appeal to some and be a turn off for others. CONSTRUCTION: Still a lot going on but the noise never bothered us. They were working on the other side of the pool while we were sitting out there and it was fine. OTHER TIPS: If you want to go to the outlet mall. Take the hotel shuttle to the airport, then a taxi to the mall ($12.00). This will take you about 35 minutes total from the hotel. If you take the shuttle to Fashion Mall, then the bus to the outlet mall, you will have to tranfer at the bus station and it took me 2 hours to get from the hotel to the outlet mall.

It far surpassed our expectations for a resort of this price. The rooms were huge as was the bathroom, complete with two sinks. Beautiful d\u00e9cor and spotlessly clean. The beds were wonderful, rooms quiet, lighting was good and the Plasma TV was a fun touch. We liked the lay out of the property and found it easy to get around. Not always the case in a huge resort. Places were well marked and nothing seemed too far. The pool area is spectacular. We visited with one of the Security men in the pool area and found that a lot of Movie Stars are visiting RR these days and staying in the $10,000 a day suites. For you casino lovers this is the nicest casino I\u2019ve ever been in, and I\u2019ve been in a lot. All the machines are the table type and the chairs are adjustable to different heights. All spanking new and clean. The casino was well laid out also. The smoke was a non issue as the ventilation was very good. With just a two day visit we didn\u2019t even begin to explore it all. My husband and I take walkie talkie\u2019s with us when we go to casinos. You can get a cheap pair at Radio Shack and they are perfect. We may use them at the mall also\u2026We can always find each other that way. We are not food connoisseurs and don\u2019t require fancy meals. The coffee shop was wonderful, with a lot of good selections and the Feast buffet good as always. They have two Starbucks for the coffee crowd and although there were no coffee pots in the rooms, (that I missed) one of the Starbucks was right in the lobby so you could go down and get a cup and bring it back to the room to sip while you dressed. The room lay out is different. Each two rooms have a separate small hallway. Very nice and a classy touch. If you can afford it and don\u2019t like the noise and confusion of the strip a definitely great place to stay. We found the staff to be helpful, polite, and well informed. The cleaning lady was really sweet and asked if I liked the soap and spa items in the room. When I said yes she gave me an entire set to take home.

As the patriarch is a high-roller, we generally stay at places like the Mirage, Bellagio, etc. We were going to a bat mitzvah in the North Vegas area and he was invited to try out the Red Rock in hopes of that becoming his preferred hotel. That won\u2019t be happening anytime soon. Appearance-wise, the hotel is absolutely beautiful. It\u2019s clean, shiny, and classy. The valet service was pretty prompt (it took a while once or twice) and generally polite. A road bump came when we didn\u2019t see a valet beckoning us to his lane to park; when we got out, he asked us to get back in the car and move it into his lane (despite the fact that he had already come over to us and could\u2019ve\u2014and eventually did\u2014taken the car from us right then and there). I found the front desk staff and concierge friendly as well. Our two rooms were great (we booked one as a comp, the other at casino rate) and always made up promptly in the morning. However, once we exited our elevator onto our floor, a musty odor greeted us every time. (I liken it to the gymnasium at an elementary school where my mother once taught). Apparently, the plumbing was still being worked on at another part of the property. We eventually adapted to the smell after a while but it was still rather unpleasant. We awoke on our first morning (at 8am) to drilling coming from the room above us. We ventured to the pool, which is a great area. There\u2019s a fantastic poolside bar & grill with decent service and great food and drinks (my girlfriend would like to recommend the shrimp wrap). The waitresses serving the sunbathers were charming and relatively prompt. There\u2019s a fun little waterfall island in the middle of the pool which is a big hit with the kids\u2026which brings up another observation: there are too many darn kids at the property\u2014but not the hotel\u2019s fault as capitalism rules :). The casino really left more to be desired. The dealers were very hit (no pun intended) or miss. Some were friendly but others were not\u2014and really acted as though we gamblers were a burden on them. One in particular seemed to be having a bad day and was not welcoming at all. Another took a gambler\u2019s money after he won; when the gambler called attention to this and politely asked the pit boss to come over, the dealer became very agitated with the gambler and seemed to be condemning him for becoming upset that his money was, you know, taken from him when he WON. There seems to be a major lack of cocktail waitresses; if I got my drink within 15 minutes of ordering it, it was nothing short of a small miracle. When the waitresses would drop off a drink and someone else at the table would request one, the typical answer was a curt \u201cUh, I\u2019m not taking orders now\u2014just delivering!\u201d We played $1 slots for well over an hour and a waitress never got within 50 feet of us. On a personal note, I\u2019ve never, ever had the bad luck that I did at this casino; I\u2019ve never seen the dealers get more face cards than I did this past weekend.
