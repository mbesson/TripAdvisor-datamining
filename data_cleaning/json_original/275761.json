The hotel overall was so and so... Nothing special to write about. However, the location is terrible. The bus stop that takes you to \"Roma Termini\" (The main train station in Rome) is about a 10 minute walk and arrives every 30 minutes. The bus ride alone is about 15-20 minutes depending on the traffic. The hotel room is VERY NOISY! You can hear everything from the elevator, to people walking in the hallways with their bags and the people in the room next to you having a normal conversation. The size of the room was average. The bed was also a pretty descent size considering that my boyfriend is 6 ft 7 (2 meters) tall. I will also add that the hotel and room was very clean and the decor wasn't so bad.

I had read them before I visited and stayed at the Ars Hotel and so I was a little worried and concerned. I needn't have been. From the moment we arrived the staff could not do enough for us. They were also extremely helpful when we were asking advice on how to get to and from the different areas of Rome to either visit the monuments or to recommend a good place for us to eat. This was my second time in Rome and the trip was a birthday present from my boyfriend. My boyfriend had made requests via email that we had a Jacuzzi bath in our room as a treat for me, and this had been arranged for our arrival. The breakfast it a traditional European Breakfast with the bread, toast, jam, cereal, yoghurt, ham, cheese, eggs and the delicious cake that you only ever get severed for breakfast whilst in Europe. As a well as teas, juices and and coffees. The hotel is a little way out of central Rome but it is very easy to find your way into the city, especially with the staff being as helpful as they were. They also provided us with maps to help you get around the city and would detail down our route and the bus numbers that we needed. I quite enjoyed being a little out of the city as I felt that I experienced and saw how the some of the Italian\u2019s lived. There is also a traditional deli close to the hotel on the main road and an ice-cream parlour selling pastries and cakes as well. Drinks, ice-cream and pastries were also cheaper further out of the city. I decided to write this review after reading all of the other bad reviews regarding this hotel.

Unfortunately they did very little to make up for this during our stay.

The hotel is the best value for your money because of its location. It is right outside of city centre and right up the hill from a great bus station. Everyone travels by bus in Rome so it was a very comfortable experience. They make it very navigatible. With a week-long bus pass and a great map we were able to visit all of the sights ourselves and never once got lost. We always got off at the same location: Monument of Vittorio Emanuele II (or what is known as the Typewriter or Wedding cake).

Nary a smile or helpful attitude. I'm sorry, but I don't speak italian, and maybe if I did they would have been a tad warmer, but I doubt it. HINT: Don't be tempted to check in early, either, as you will be assigned a room in the dungeon next to the housekeeping office. Did they bother to tell us when I checked in that the toilet was not flushing and that there was no running water? NO! I had to call them and when I asked about it, again, an insulting tone of voice. They really should have told us when we checked in....but that would have been too easy. The location is a pain to get to and the neighborhood is somewhat sketchy. Of course street signs in Rome make it almost impossible to find by car or on foot (from the bus). Even though you might get a better rate staying here, you will spend that money on a cab getting there or going to Termini or elsewhere in Rome...especially if you have a cab driver (one of the official ones mind you) that charged me 30 Euros and an additional 2 for the bags. Ha! I only gave him 20 so he was not so happy about that, but after I found out that my partner took a cab from the same location and was only charged 12 Euro I felt justified. Okay, back to the hotel....they are simply adequate. The breakfast was good though and they will make you delicious cappucino for breakfast. The breakfast dude didn't look happy either. When you work in a hotel where there are very many tourists coming from all over the world, kind words and a smile are appreciated. When we asked for directions the gentleman at the desk wrote all over a map (and by this I mean he wrote over the street names so we couldn't read them!). A suggestion would be that they print out directions in English, French and Italian, as a supplement to their directions. They should also have directions printed out to get to the airport and Termini by bus and car, along with the general going rate for taxi service to the top spots in town. By the way, they do have internet service in the lobby, but the printer did not work...a simple sing written in English and ITalian stating that the printer is broken and that if you need to print something out, email it to the hotel and they will print it for you would have been better than stressing out thinking that you might not be able to print your boarding pass.

Like the other reviewers we caught the bus into Rome and didn't have any issues. The bus runs every 10 minutes and costs $1. The rooms were quite modern and included WiFi. There are two free computers in the lobby with high speed Internet. They even have a free printer which we made use of. The safe in the room costs $5 for your stay - which I found strange. The breakfast was nice with ample selection.

The room itself was nice, big bed and bathroom quite clean. Unfortunately there was a terrible smell in the room which would not go, possibly the smell of stale cigarettes even though we did request a non smoking room.

Breakfast was continental, there was plenty to choose from and it was stocked up regularly so this was impressive.

We had extras to pay on our bill which we knew about, a couple of drinks and 5 EUROS for using the safe which totalled 20.50, however the older gentleman on the desk informed us we had 50EUROS to pay which was obviously incorrect. He then proceeded to tell us that this was for the mini-bar which we did not use, which I tried to explain to him and that I was not paying for this. By this point I was getting quite frustrated by how rude he was being, he then continued to shout in Italian at me, he could have been saying anything for all I know! After trying to make a number of phone calls and not being able to talk to anyone he accepted the 20.50 I had put on the desk by just saying \u201cThank-you & Bye\u201d in general a very rude man, who spoilt the visit completely by accusing us incorrectly of using the mini bar.

The bus station is very close, and you can reach the city center easy and fast using tram or bus (tram no. 90 or bus no. 36), which gets you to termini station, from where you can explore the whole city center. I suggest you to buy a weekly bus ticket for 16 euro, that can be used for all bus, tram, metro and train lines of the city, it certainly worth paying for.

Get a taxi from the station and they will charge you around 40 euro's and it will take half the time to get there, i think he drove us the long way round so that we could get our monies worth!

The hotel was nice, clean and the staff very help. Even before departing for Rome I contacted the hotel via their website and asked how I could reach them by public transport. I was sent a fairly prompt response back which I was very impressed with. My main concern was that due to the fact I was arriving on a Sunday, their day of rest, i wasn't sure if reaching them woud be easy. I had no problems. I took the Leonardo express train from FCO to Rome Termini Station (A one way ticket costs 11euros) and then took the no. 90 bus (1 euro) to Piazza Sempione. The hotel does offer an airport transfer shuttle service which costs 60euros (luggage cost are included). My only criticism of the hotel is it's location. It is a fair distance out and not close to any train stations. Bus nos. 90 (to termini station), and 60 (takes you to piazza venezia. useful place to get off to see the roman forum and colleseum) are the useful ones to catch. The bus no. 40 will take you from termini station to the vatican. Bus services, especially the no. 90 finish at about 12am, so after that time, taxis would be your only alternative. Another thing to be weary of is that often the bus stop signs are not all that well lit/clear therefore making it hard to see if your getting off at the right place. The hotel does mention on it's website that they offer a free shuttle service to termini station, but for some reason, it wasn't running during the 3 days i was there. Still not sure why. The best thing I found was to buy a one day travelcard which costs around 4 euros and you can buy it at any news kiosk. If you are intending on doing a few museums over several days then a Roma Pass may work out cheaper (20euros) Overall, I would not discount staying here again however, if you are going to Rome for the first time I would probably recommend you stay a little more closer to the centre.

Mine was a business trip and for once i decided to be closer to the meeting, instead of the more central via veneto where i stayed in the past. Well, i have to say that next time i'll go back to have my taxi trip on the morning and be more central and in a real 4+ star hotel. The staff on the other side was very nice and friendly.

The roof terrace was fab to sit with drinks in the evening. We stayed in the annex, with a lift up to the 4th floor. Room was spacious and light, again, it was clean but some stains on the surfaces let it down a bit. Bathroom was small but managed to cram in a separate shower and spa-bath which was a bonus. Hotel recommended a restaurant close by for dinner, it was good, but not exceptional, I preferred heading into the city for dinner the second night for the atmosphere. Breakfast at the hotel was okay, pastries, choice of cereal, sliced meat/cheese, a usual continental, nothing too exciting. It was just a 5min walk to the bus stop into the city centre and about a 30min bus ride, which was probably the most uncomfortable I've endured in a long while! Hot, crowded, airless and standing all the way in, we were with friends so shared a taxi after our initial bus-experience which varied from about 15-20euro one way, which I didn't think was too bad considering the alternative!

Good staff, very helpful and attentive. Only problem is location, though this was not a problem for me, it might be for some folk. The hotel is about 20 mins from city centre by bus (which goes every 5 mins.) and the area is a bit run down, though the street the hotel's on is quiet and residential and the area feels pretty safe generally. FANTASTIC breakfast ! You can easily stoke up for the day and not need to eat until dinner time...which I did !! Warning....do NOT touch the mini bar, it's a rip off, and those snacks laid out like freebies are not ! Hotel will give you a card for a nearby restaurant which is pretty good, but I preferred the Menenio Agrippa on Via Nomentana. I found the staff friendlier and less \"tourist weary\". There are several Pizza places and bars around. All the ones I went to were good. To catch the bus into the city, turn right at the bottom of the road that the hotel's on. Note a news Kiosk at which you can buy tickets (16 E for a week, unlimited travel bus train or metro, or 1E single trip). Get to crossroads , turn right and you'll see the 90 bus stop. If you want to go to Colisseum you can take the 60 by turning left instead of right at the crossroads. Both buses are expresses and run very frequently. Bus stops about 3-4 mins walk from hotel. The hotel gives directions to the hotel involving train, metro and bus. MUCH simpler is to catch a shuttle bus to the main station and catch a no.90 bus. I would not recommend the Metro, particularly with luggage, it's dirty, crowded and feels a bit threatening. Don't take a taxi unless you're desperate, they're very expensive. Note that if you have to dump luggage at any time, there's a left luggage facility on platform 24 at the main station (Termini) Don't let the location of this hotel put you off, it's an easy trip into the city and it can be nice to withdraw from the noise and bustle of the city after a long day trekking around the sights.", "Date": "April 7, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Italy", "Title": "\u201cGood\u201d", "Author": "dottorsocrates", "ReviewID": "UR7185002", "Content": "Nice and clean hotel.

It is modern and clean as described. Our room was quite small and didn't have a bath but we found it suited us fine. You get a shower cap with love hearts so that makes up for it.

I stayed here with my 2 young children, their 2 cousins and aunt in 2 family rooms for 3 nights last weekend and cannot fault our experience in any way. The hotel is relatively small, but having less than 50 rooms, I consider the facilities to have been excellent. Stars are not awarded for size, after all. All staff that I encountered were friendly, efficient and couteous. They were also extremely helpful, providing accurate information on how to travel into the city centre, what to see, where to eat, how to use the buses etc. The hotel is very well sign-posted in the local vicinity but you might be better to take a taxi if arriving after dark in the first instance. Do not expect brocade and chintz. And do not expect to feel that you are in an anonomous chain hotel room that could be anywhere. Instead, expect something that is a little bit different. Quirky even. Something that is bright, airy and stylish. Expect white walls and contemporary art. Barcelona-inspired leather sofas and chairs. Think minimalism and Phillipe Starck and you'll get the general idea. As this is not a purpose built chain hotel, the bedrooms are all different. Our rooms were extremely spacious and comfortable. And without a shadow of doubt, had the most comfortable hotel beds I have slept in anywhere in the world (and I was the one in the sofa-bed!). Our bed linen was changed during our 3 night stay - I've gone a week in 'better hotels' before that's been done. The TV had English language satelite channels. There was a mini bar. The bathroom was not overly large but it was spotlessly clean. As was the room itself. And I hadn't travelled to Rome to sit in the bathroom or in my hotel bedroom anyway. Here's a hint - the blinds in the bedrooms are double blinds, having a secondary total blackout blind behind the less opaque decorative one. I did not notice the noise referred to by others in spite of having windows with dual aspects and my head being effectively the other side of the elevator shaft. The hotel was full, there were families with young babies etc and I heard no noise despite being a light sleeper and insomniac if conditions are not to my liking. Sirens? Didn't hear any around the hotel but it is Rome! Nor did I hear doors slamming or others' footsteps. This hotel does not pretend to be something that it is not. Therefore there is no swanky piano bar. But it is possible to be served drinks in the small area off the reception. And they'll pop a cd in the player for you to create some atmosphere! There is internet access and a computer to use in the lounge. There's a small gym, lift and nice gardens with a seating terrace. It's clean. And it's not expensive. There is no restaurant, catering being limited to the breakfast room on the lower garden level. Breakfast is an unpretentious affair - continental with a perfectly adequate selection of breads, croissants, cereals, fruit, meats and cheese etc. Teas, coffee and fruit juices. No fried bacon and eggs though if that's more your style. For the evening, we were directed to an excellent local restaurant less than 5 mins walk from the hotel. The Citt\u00e0 Giardino is very much a locals' place with authentic Itallian cuisine rather than a tourist haunt and we enjoyed it so much we returned there 3 nights in a row. Clearly, we were therefore walking around at night time. I did not feel unsafe at any time walking to or from the hotel to this restaurant. I felt quite comfortable with 4 children under the age of 12 to be on the streets after 11pm and simply cannot understand other references to the area being unsafe. There is some graffiti around. But Rome is covered in the stuff and has been since ancient times (it's an Italian word after all). And like most places, Rome gets dark as the evening progresses! One things for sure - we were walking the streets late and at the weekend. The streets of most British cities and many British towns at that time would be peopled by marauding gangs of drunken youths, frequently with malicious intent. Or staggering bands of scantily clad young women singing bawdy songs loudly and throwing up after one Bacardi Breezer too many. Here, in my experience, you're more likely to encounter someone taking their dog out for a late evening stroll. Much has been said on the subject of this hotel's location. It's not in the centre of Rome - it's in the suburbs. That's what you are paying for. Don't go to this hotel if you want to step outside the front door and be in the midst of it all. But it's easy to get into the centre. There are very frequent express buses from the stops close to the hotel that will take you to either the railway / bus terminus (No 90) where you can pick up the tour buses and subway or to the city centre (No 60). The journey time is around 25-30 mins and will provide you with an authentic Roman experience. Tickets are available from the news kiosk at the bottom of the hill and cost 1 euro. Ask at reception for one of their maps - really good and no need to buy anything else. In summary, this is a good choice if you're looking for something that's slightly different, good value and you don't mind making a relatively short journey by public transport into the city centre. Don't choose it if you want everything on your doorstep, lots of local bars and restaurants, don't like the minimalist look and prefer squidgy sofas and everything under the same roof.", "Date": "November 25, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rome", "Title": "\u201cARS is must SKIP!!!\u201d", "Author": "mr/mr.smith", "ReviewID": "UR6136658", "Content": "Look I'm the nice guy on the block and I hate giving negative feedback, but this is a must. First thing you notice when arriving at the hotel, which costs 70 Euro by taxi, is that you are by no means in a safe area. My wife and I have been traveling for 2 weeks between Belfast, London, France and now Rome, and this hotel has been the one place we actually have felt unsafe in the area around the hotel. Ok when it comes to the hotel it looks new and shiny, but it is in no way a 4 star hotel. We stayed at a 3 star in Belfast and it was much better than this could ever have been. Our first room was cramp and broken up. It had a small area as you walk in the door that had 2 plastic space age chairs for your most uncomfortable use. Seeing as how I have a business to run while I'm away this was not going to work. The bathroom had only a shower and enough counter space for 1 persons stuff. To add insult it was in the back of the property which required going down 2 flights of stairs and than back up another couple of flights because waiting and waiting for the lift was no use. So we asked to be moved to another room with a desk and maybe a tub this time? Ah the new room, more space, a desk, no A/C!!!! We came to find out that the rooms in the hotel have seasonal climate control, meaning the hotel decides when you get to be hot and when you get to be cold. As one of the previous reviews stated, the noise is ridiculous. Every time a door closes in the hotel you get a loud bang. Not to mention that every person on your floor wearing heels is a marching band. King size bed in the new room was 2 twins pushed together. I'm 6' and the toes were hanging over the edge the whole night. Don't get me wrong this hotel is trying, but they are missing the mark. For first time visitors, stay away.

The hotel provided free internet access in every room, and a pc connected to the internet in the lounge room. The staff were very friendly, and very helpful. I recommend that you do not waste you money on buying a street map. I brought a street map and was then given a map by the hotel...I think you can guess which one I used the most! Yes, that\u2019s right, the free one from the hotel. I used it so much that I brought it back home, with holes in it! The one negative point I noticed when I read previous reviews, was the location of the hotel, so I was very wary as to how I would find the hotel once I landed in Rome and how I would get about sightseeing. I was stupid for being so stressed out...it was so simple. DO NOT GET A TAXI! I can guarantee you will be ripped off! I landed in Ciampino airport, once you pick up your luggage if you proceed to the exit you will see a Terravision desk. Terravision works with the airlines to provided transfers to the Termini station. You can pay 8euros for a single trip or you can pay 13.50euros for a return (Very reasonable, since a taxi is 50 euros each way). I recommend a return ticket, then you will not have to worry about trying to get back to the airport. Anyway once we were on the bus, we travelled for 30-35 mins to the Termini station, they dropped us off outside the main entrance (this is also where they will pick you up from on your return). Be very careful here, as several taxi drivers will claim that you booked a taxi DO NOT TAKE A TAXI! Once at the station, you need to purchase bus tickets, you can get this from a newsagents across the street (very cheap- 1 euro for numerous bus trips for 75 mins) once you have your bus ticket, you need to get on the No 90 Express, you won't have to wait long as they are very frequent. Depending on the time of day you use these buses, depends on how cramped you will be, try to avoid rush hours. You will be on the bus for approx 25-30 mins, you will go over 2 bridges and then you need to keep your eyes peeled for the Sempione stop. When you get off this bus, your will see signs for the Ars hotel. However I will give you the instructions as I failed to see the signs! Opposite the bus stop there is a newsstand, you need to walk up this road, where you will pass a petrol station, you will also see a Blockbusters further up the street. There is an opening up this street, which is where you need to go, this will take you up a slight slope and round to the back of the hotel and to the reception. When you return home, you just need to do everything in reverse...couldn't be simpler!!! Getting around Rome using only the buses was a challenge, but it can be done. When deciding what bus to take you will see on the board or several boards which buses will pick up from the stop. You will notice on the boards that there are arrows pointing down, you need to make sure that your destination is after the stop you are at, else you could end up in the sticks! I brought The AA Essential Guide to Rome, this was really good as it told you what buses to catch and what stops to get off at, so I would recommend buying this or something similar (very cheap for \u00a35.99) People told me that Rome was very expensive, but I was pleasantly surprised, in respect of food and sightseeing. I would recommend a guided tour around the Vatican and St. Peters else you will wander around not really knowing what your looking at, we paid 21.50euros for a guided tour around the Vatican museums, well worth the money, the guide was very enthusiastic and well learnt. You can enrol for the tour once inside the museum. We also took a tour of the Colosseum and the Forum for 20 euros, this was worth while also, the tours are readily available around the Colosseum. It would also be a good idea to purchase a book before you go to gain some knowledge of the history of Rome and its sights. You can walk down a road and suddenly come across a building that will take your breath away (corny I know...but true) and you will want to know what it is! Overall my stay at the Ars hotel was superb and Rome itself was amazing. It is a history and a culture that everyone should experience...I hope you enjoy your holiday to Rome as much as I did!", "Date": "September 8, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "California", "Title": "\u201cGREAT Hotel\u201d", "Author": "WayneNCalif", "ReviewID": "UR5779339", "Content": "Stayed at this property with my daughter as the first part of our \"first time out of the USA\" vacation..

It seems like it has been recently renovated. The furniture and style of the hotel are very modern. The rooms were super clean, the bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was great. It is a stand-up shower but that was fine with us. It had good water pressure and they provided nice sized towels I felt as though the staff was very attentive and helpful. I called down for extra pillows and they arrived within minutes. Free internet was available in the room which was a nice perk. Oh, there's an elevator too in case you have large luggage. It's a normal size elevator too. Cereal, rolls, crossiants, danishes, meat and cheese and fruit were available for breakfast. The breakfast was very good and I highly recommend taking advantage of it. It was never so crowded that there were no tables available as a previous review stated. Using the bus to get into town was really simple. Once you come out of the hotel take a right and another right at the main street. You'll pass a Blockbuster and laundromat. Keep going down this street and make a right just after the fruit stand. The bus stop looks like a median in the road on the right side past the fruit stand. This is where you can catch the #60 Express or #90 Express. Both take you into the city and take 15-20 minutes. If you're coming from Termini to the hotel take the #90 bus from Termini to Piazza di Sempione and walk up Monte Altemisso, it's on a hill to ARS. You have to walk around to the back side of the hotel to enter, it's a less than 5 minute walk total from the bus stop. If you take a taxi to the hotel make sure to get tickets before you get on the bus. If you've read anything about Rome though, you know to avoid the taxis, they are outrageous! You can get tickets at the newsstand that's right on that corner. I definitely wouldn't let the fact that you need to take a bus deter you from staying at ARS. It was really easy. In fact, it was nice to stay out of the city and see what it's like outside the city. It was a very pretty and peaceful neighborhood. The only downside was that our a/c didn't pump out as much cold air as we'd like. It worked, it just didn't get very cool. Regardless though, we will go back to ARS if we get back to Rome.

However, the service is pretty good, and we received help with our luggage (only 2 of our 6 hotels in Italy offered any help). The neighbourhood around the hotel may look a little seedy, but it really is not bad. There's a very nice pizzeria nearby (not the one affiliated with the hotel.... can't remember its name - Hosteria something or other) - just ask at the front desk. The hotel is a bit away from the historical center, but they offer a free shuttle to Termini station every morning (one way - you have to take a cab or a bus back at night - a cab from Termini is around 15 euros, but if you flag one down on the street, it's a bit cheaper with no station surcharge).

Transport links to the centre are good - Express trolleybus 90 goes every few minutes (in theory) but traffic problems (and highly unionised drivers) mean that the timetable is not really worth the paper its written on. The trolleybus can get massively crowded but here's a tip: If one comes after a bit of a delay and its very crowded stand back and wait. There will generally be another one along in a few minutes (sometimes straight away) and that one will be much quieter. For a quieter but slower route try the 36.
