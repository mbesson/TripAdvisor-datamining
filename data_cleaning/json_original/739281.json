This is our fifth year of coming to Playa del Carmen/Cozumel for a week in the springtime. Previously, we had stayed at some of the big all inclusives, and wanted a smaller, more intimate experience this year. Before choosing Petit Laffitte, we did a lot of research on Trip Advisor. Overall, the reviews on Petit Lafitte accurately reflect our experience of the resort. It is beautiful, and we loved the smaller, more intimate nature of the property. The service was very good, although some of the meal service was a bit \"leisurely\" at times. We found the bungalow very nice, not as luxurious as the large hotels but very charming and comfortable. The air conditioner worked fine, even though they did maintenance on the system one day. The beach is amazing, with plenty of chairs and papalas available no matter what time we made it to the beach. We did have two areas of criticism. While the food was acceptable, some nights it was very good, other nights only passable. Our first night, they had fresh grouper that was excellent. Other nights, the main courses were a bit under-seasoned and bland, as were a number of the soups. We never went hungry, but some nights were better than others. Our biggest issue was with the hot water. The first day when we tried to take a shower in the late afternoon after a day on the beach, the hot water was the same temperature as the cold. Also, the pressure was so weak sometimes it barely cleared the shower head. The next day, we went into Playa for the day, and we told the front desk about the hot water issue. They said that three of the bungalows shared the same hot water heater, so sometimes you had to let the water run for a while for it to heat up (although since I took an entire shower with both faucets on full, I would think that would have been long enough to heat up). When we returned that afternoon, two of the maintenance guys accompanied us back to our room and the water was piping hot and had decent pressure, almost immediately - obviously, they had done something on the issue while we were in town. However, the next day, we tried again to take a shower in the late afternoon, and it was back to very cold and low pressure. We waited until after dinner and tried again, and the water had heated up, but it was not as hot as the previous day. It was hit or miss like this the rest of our stay, and some days the hot water was not so hot and very brief. I understand the quaintness of staying in a bungalow, but the lack of hot water took us from quaintness to something a bit more like camping. Would we go back to Petit Lafitte? If we could be guaranteed of adequate hot water, I would go back in a second. Maybe I'm just acting like a spoiled American.", "Date": "March 24, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "wi", "Title": "\u201cSo Much Beauty\u201d", "Author": "sandygalWi", "ReviewID": "UR126558765", "Content": "We stayed at Petit Lafitte the first week of March. Before coming I had read everything I could get my hands on. Since the vast majority of the reviews were so positive I had very high expectations! Thankfully, they were generally met, we had a wonderfully relaxing time and would return without question. The only thing that we were not overwhelmed with was the main course at dinner as they tended toward the bland side. However when considering that they are trying to accomadate people from many different cultures, that may explain the need for having dishes that will suit different flavour palates. The self serve soup and salad/vegetable spread, though, more than made up for it. One night, the soup was a delicious cauliflower soup, the salad was fresh crispy romaine, a selection of cheeses, DELICIOUS grilled zuchini and red onion with a cumin flavour, and roasted beets, just to mention some of what was offered! Between that and the fresh bread, I was basically full for the main course so it really wasn't a problem on the nights that I may have been underwhelmed by the main dish. The reason I go into detail on this subject is because there have been many rave reviews about the food, and while some meals lived up to the raving, some did not. We never went hungry, the breakfasts were great, and the lunches were delicious, so my comments are to give a heads up to those whose expectations are as high as mine were. There was a decent selection of wine, a bottle of chilean merlot/cabernet for 190 pesos, very reasonable. The margaritas, pina coladas and mojitos (best ever) were all fabulous! And, as mentioned so often, the staff went out of their way to take care of any need or want. Truly genuinely friendly, hospitable people. Vacation for us is good food and a quiet lovely beach. The beach met our high expectations!! So beautiful, so relaxing, could not ask for more. We had bungalow #1, oceanfront! What a treat, it was hard to absorb how beautiful the view was from the front porch. When we walked down the beach in both directions, and saw the huge resorts, with their crowded lounger area, we were so grateful we were headed back to our Lafitte Retreat! It may not be as luxurious as some of them were, but we would not trade our quiet comfortable spot any day for more luxury. And that is why Petit Lafitte ultimately does live up to the hype! Let first say that there were buffets twice and the food was delicious both of those nights.", "Date": "March 23, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Madison, Wisconsin", "Title": "\u201cJust what we were looking for...\u201d", "Author": "lueallen", "ReviewID": "UR126513232", "Content": "A perfect ocean front bungalow looking out through palms to a pristine beach.

When I asked for decaf coffee, and was given a cup of tepid water and a huge bottle of instant Sanka, I wondered what we'd gotten ourselves into. But by the end of Day 2, I was a believer. Even with overcast, rainy days, I don't think I've ever had a more relaxing vacation. You have to get into the rhythm of the place (which is very slow), to properly appreciate it. A leisurely cup of coffee, then a choice of whether to go to a beach chaise, a hammock, or one of the front porch stairs (we stayed in a bungalow, which I highly recommend). Then a walk on the powdery sand and maybe a move to a different place of relaxation. A brief morning siesta, and it's almost time for lunch (the fish or shrimp tacos are good). More walking, more reading, and then to the bar for happy hour. Even the food, which I was so doubtful about at first, seemed to improve as the days went by. I've probably never eaten so many fresh fruits and vegetables as I did in the week we were there. As so many others have said, the employees are uniformly friendly, efficient, helpful, and kind. I especially appreciated that they tactfully encouraged your use of Spanish--they were all fluent in English, but the staff often reminded you of the Spanish word as well. My very limited Spanish vocabulary doubled or tripled during our stay. There are some things you should be aware of before deciding whether Petit Lafayette is the right place for you. The wi-fi connection is spotty. The bungalows are very clean, and the sheets are changed every day, but they're not at all luxurious. The shower's temperature and flow were both highly changeable. A trip into Playa requires a taxi ride (or a pretty long and sandy walk). And then there's that bottle of instant Sanka. Because it's a small resort, your experience could depend on who was in the bungalow next to you. On our last day, a family with a seemingly unlimited number of voluble and enthusiastic children checked in. I think our experience of Petit Lafitte as a peaceful retreat would have been different if the same family had been there all week. On the other hand, if we'd complained about our neighbors, my guess is that the staff would have tried everything possible in order to accommodate us. They clearly wanted us to have a good time, and we did.", "Date": "March 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Austin, Texas", "Title": "\u201cA Little Tropical Paradise\u201d", "Author": "Gina B", "ReviewID": "UR126288586", "Content": "If you are looking for a relaxing beach getaway, away from crowded gigantic resorts, this is the place.

The staff is great -- polite, helpful, friendly, willing to practice a little Spanish with you, etc.etc. Without exception, top-notch people working there that added so much to our stay. Beautiful fruit selection every morning, great toast (homemade bread? tasted like it), great banana pancakes, huevos racheros, etc. Sample the cocktails -- wonderful, fun, professional bartender that knew his stuff and obviously took pride in his drinks. The mojitos and margaritas were the best I've ever had (including places like Rick Bayless' Frontera Grill). Beach is BEAU-TI-FUL! Some nice places to swim, great sandy beach to walk on.

Excellent fresh fruit and yogurt at the breakfast buffet - my favorite egg dish remains the Huevos Motulenos - and every dinner was superb. We usually opted for a later dinner (we didn't skip many meals !!), and especially enjoyed the Wednesday evening mellow music of a talented guitar and violin duo.

Make that *two* pina coladas. I had researched several dozen area hotels and resorts for a month, narrowing them down one by one until I was sure I had found the best combination of comfort, location, amenities, and, of course, price: Petit Lafitte. After staying there for about a week, I can say I was more right than I could have ever known. With about 40 rooms -including 17 beachfront bungalows - Petit's lodgings all have tiled floors, fans, A/C, safes, minibars, coffee makers, and free Wi-Fi.The private bathrooms also come outfitted with a hairdryer. The bungalows -where I stayed- are rustic chic, set in grove of coconut trees. Large and spacious, the room's noisiest aspect was the rhythmic whoosh of the surf and the occasional plonk! of a coconut dropping to the ground. The bungalow shared all the same amenities as the regular hotel rooms, too, except for phones and TVs, which you'll miss about as much as I missed my down parka. Every day at Petit was a mix of Margaritaville and the Garden of Eden. If you're feeling ambitious, the activities center, located in a kiosk facing the ocean, could arrange for scuba diving, snorkeling, kite surfing, etc. either there or in the area's caverns, caves, reefs, and the like. Or, if you're like me and play at relaxing the way others play at Farmville, you just lie on a chaise lounge under palm trees or in a hammock that swings gently in the nap-inducing breezes. The beach itself has sand as white as cotton balls, and in my opinion, after walking several miles up and down the beach, is the most pristine and immaculately-kept beachfront of any hotel or resort there. Getting in some walks was a necessary evil after downing the pina coladas, margaritas, and \"daquiri y limons\" at the Petit's open-air bar a few steps from the Caribbean. Nothing there is made from scratch; in fact, they grab some of the fallen coconuts and use the fresh fruit to make your pina coladas. Hang out at the bar at night and you'll also run into several people who have been returning here for up to 20 years -which is in itself the kind of review you can never buy, only earn. After all that pina colada-slinging, hammock-swinging exertion, I needed to replenish myself at the Petit dining room. (Along with breakfast, diner is included in the the cost of a room.) Unlike the mega-resorts, Petit doesn't put out an assembly line of 739 dishes in an effort to convince you that bloated is better. Here you get two main entrees - one of which is usually a seafood dish- and a buffet of salad ingredients as well as soups, such as a perfectly made poblano-pepper soup I enjoyed one night. There's also the nightly dessert, of which the flan was as light as an angel's wings. Based on traditional Mexican and Yucatan cuisine, the food was simple but freshly made. For me, the highlight was the Wednesday-night BBQ where the chef served up marinated pork, beef, chicken, and fish entrees that were sublime in their balance of spicy and savory tastes. Their homemade guacamole and pico de gallo would have made Rick Bayless break down and cry in envy. Anyone feeling the need to leave the hotel can arrange virtually any kind of tour or activity through the always-helpful concierge service there as well as transportation back to the airport when you depart -although by then you'll leave only after realizing, yes, you do have bills and a job to return to somewhere. As for me, i plan on coming back in a few months -because too much of the Petit is not enough.", "Date": "February 10, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wellington, New Zealand", "Title": "\u201cMexico Magic\u201d", "Author": "Tana4pm", "ReviewID": "UR124370193", "Content": "One of the joys of being married to a travel shop manager is you get to benefit from all of the years of experience and feedback they have first hand.

No attempt to advise hotel guests about the issue and what they were doing about it. We had to ask after enduring it for two days. The resident had even built up piles of rubbish outside his house, guests from other hotels walking along the beach were stopping to take pictures!

The grounds of the hotel are beautiful and the scale is such that it is a short walk from one's room to the pool, the beach, or the restaurant.

The hotel manages to cater to different tastes and interests--young couples without children, young couples with children, older couples, family reunions, Americans, Canadians, Europeans and Asians. Everyone seemed to get along very well, The design of the grounds ensures that people have enough personnel space when they need it, but also places to meet other guests. The guests who come here seem to be somewhat \"self selecting\" in that they are looking for something different from the large glitzy resorts on the Mayan Riviera. Although the hotel caters to many different tastes, it is relatively peaceful and quiet. There is a bar, and it is hopping at night, but it does not disturb the peacefulness of the resort. The only minor criticism I would have is that with such a small hotel, the food choices are somewhat limited. There is a menu at breakfast, and there are a lot of choices, but at dinner there are only two entrees offered.

Was a little worried when arriving due to that last stretch of unpaved road, but the resort itself is perfectly fine so those worries were quickly put to rest. As we booked very late, we did not stay in one of the bungalows, but we were very happy with the room we had. Simple, functional and clean. Kids (4 and 6) loved the beach and water, but it was a little rough for the youngest one without a helping hand. The plentiful seaweed was a bit of a turn-off at first, but you quickly get used to it. Lots of families there, and the kids enjoyed playing with the other kids running around. In fact, we didn't travel much outside the resort as it was so easy to stay there and relax. It felt completely safe to let the kids run around and play, so we weren't worried if they were out of sight for a bit. The pool was a bit cold when you first jump in, but it was definitely warm enough to enjoy. We split each day between the beach and the pool and had plenty of fun with both. Food was almost always good to great in our opinion-- we were pleasantly surprised at the quality at dinner our first night. Dinner was our favorite meal of the day, but the late start (7pm) and slow serving time was tough for the kids to wait for after a hard day of play in the sun. After a couple days, we figured out that ordering some food from the bar (which serves simple food for lunch) a couple hours before dinner would keep them from being quite so hungry. Couldn't avoid them being tired though! There were a couple of buffet nights (special holiday meals) that were perfect as you could avoid the wait time. The best thing about Petit Lafitte is the staff and service. They were always friendly and helpful without exception. They helped us arrange a rental car which was dropped off and picked up directly at the hotel, which was very convenient for the 2 days we used it.

Breakfast is excellent, with lots of fruit and a number of freshly cooked options. There is also a good lunch selection offered in the baechside bar.

If you want an 18-30's party holiday then you probably want to stay in town but for relaxtion this is the place to be. It isnt far from the main centre of Playa Del Carman - we walked it along the beach, but probably not the most sensible idea in the heat!

Bungalos were clean, well kept, property immaculate. In addition to the fantastic location, the draw to coming to Petit Lafitte is the staff. It seemed like all the employees we encountered were there to see to our needs and make our vacation special. The front desk staff of Luis, David and Eduardo were very visible around the resort and stopped frequently to talk to us and answer the million questions we seemed to throw at them. They were more than willing to arrange transportation into town, or customize an excursion, or do whatever else needed doing. The restaurant/bar staff were fabulous, and went above and beyond in making sure each meal was perfect. Baldy, Geovany, Martin and Javier are very good at what they do, and very friendly. Bartenders Jesus and Victor were also very attentive and friendly. Even the iguana that lived behind our bungalo seemed friendly, although we didn't get too close.....The tejon, maybe not so friendly! We didn't venture too far from Petit Lafitte by choice, but we did go into Playa del Carmen one day to go shopping. The front desk arranged for Ceasar to take us there in his taxi, which was great. We made a stop at the Mega store, which has just about everything. Ceasar then took us to Fifth Avenue, which was touristy and horrible! We walked up and down the street, didn't buy anything, checked out the beach, and thanked God we were staying at Petit Lafitte, far from the madness! We'd definately come back to Petit Lafitte.

You can also easily snokel right from the beach or swim out further for more. The included breakfast and dinner were also top notch. An extensive breakfast menu and a 4 course dinner (appetizer, soup, entree, dessert) as part of your price was also a great value. And make sure you try Manuel's mojitos - they're the best. The set-up of the resort is great. An open air palapas towards the rear for dining, then the pool, followed by the beachside bar and smaller dining area and the beach itself. Ample supply of chairs and shade as well as hammocks. Rooms were clean and adequate. The only downside was the beds themselves. It is traditonal mexican style cement base with mattress on top which was really hard. My husband didn't mind, and once I folded up the comforter to use as a pillow topper, it was fine. This was in the hotel section, so it may be different in the cabins. You will need mosquito repellant though for dining in the evening, but that's pretty normal for any tropical location. The location to Playa del Carmen is really good as well. You can even walk all the way down by beach (about 3miles) and taxi back. Above all, the service was A++++!!!

We spent the first week of our honeymoon here, then went to a big all-inclusive hotel for the second week. We both wished we had stayed at Petit Lafitte for both weeks. We will definitely return. You will never go wrong staying here. It was absolutely perfect. And last but not least, the concierge, David, was an absolute gem.

Luis gave us a tour of the hotel. Room: - We stayed in the most basic room with two full size beds and garden view. The beds are comfortable (set on concrete and with tiled headboard). - Wished we had duvets instead of bed spread, but it was ok since we didn\u2019t use it anyway. - We are given 5 1L bottles of water each day. - The water pressure in the shower is weak but do-able. Water was warm enough for a comfortable shower. - The room seemed a bit out of date. We didn\u2019t stay at the hotel for most of the day anyway so we were satisfied with the room. Beach: - The area right in front of the hotel is rocky and we were advised not to swim there. - Some people swim in the area between Petit Lafitte and Princess Hotel (the half-moon area to the north of the hotel). - We only swam at the beach in front of the Princess Hotel (less than 10 min walk north). It\u2019s not that crowded and we felt it was cleaner on the beach. - Go swim and snorkel in the morning! The water is much clearer and calmer. We saw a bunch of fish and even a sting ray. - Enjoy the hammocks by the beach! - If you have the time and energy, walk to 5th Ave along the beach. It takes about 2 hours but you will pass by some really nice stretches of the beach. Make sure you wear sunscreen and bring water! Pool: - We did not use the pool since the beach was so close! However the staff was very aware of the cleanliness of the pool. We saw the staff cleaning the pool every morning. Service: - Service was excellent. They knew our names by the night of our arrival. Everyone was very helpful and treated us nicely. - The staff genuinely cared about the guests. David asked about our plans each day and made sure we get the most out of our trips. - As we were leaving the hotel at 3:40am to the airport on our departure date, the kitchen made a box breakfast for us the night before so we could leave with a breakfast. Meals: The eating area for breakfast and dinner is outdoor. Make sure you wear a lot of bug spray. Breakfast - Every morning we started with a glass of OJ, a buffet of fruits, usually papaya, pineapple, mango, watermelon and honeydew. There are also yogurt, cereal and buns in the buffet. Then you can order from their breakfast menu for hot breakfast. We tried 80% of the menu during our stay and liked every one of them. Would recommend the Huevos Motulenos and the Spanish Omelet Lunch - We only had lunch once in the hotel. We ordered the petit tacos (beef) which were delicious. Even better with an ocean view. Dinner - The menu for dinner is different every night. The soup, salad bar and dessert are buffet-style. They are also different every night. - The most memorable was the cream of carrot soup! And the Mexican buffet was excellent! - Pick the seafood dish whenever you can. I would skip the beef if there\u2019s a better choice since it was dry the two times it was offered. Pros: - The room had all the basic needs - Food was great - Affordable - Location Cons: - There were really small ants running around the sink.

After researching reviews on tripadvisor and prices on expedia, my brother selected Petit Lafitte. This hotel is right on the water nestled a short distance between the Tides and Princess resorts, both much larger. Before each of those resorts, there is a short distance of small homes, undeveloped areas and small businesses. So, although anyone can walk along the public beaches, this small hotel feels somewhat private. The beach is beautiful - great sand, beautiful blue water. Staff raked up the seaweed that made it onto the shore every morning. The resort itself consists of bungalows or motel-style rooms. We stayed in rooms 301, 302 & 401, all ground floor units in the garden view rooms. Five buildings each have six units. The rooms themselves are tile floored, with two-double beds (fixed on concrete pedestals), refrigerator, TV balanced on said fridge. There is also a coffee pot (ours spilled more than it made) and plenty of bottled water (replenished daily). The room has a sink outside the bathroom with enough countertop space for toiletries. The bathroom itself consists of a toilet and shower. The toilet seat had a very wide base --- I felt like I was going to fall through! Our bed had a bedspread (hate them) and keyed door. My sister's unit had a duvet though -- would have preferred that. The TV had limited English language channels and of those, CNN did not come in clearly. The resort WiFi was hit or miss. The rooms were definitely dated (the resort is the oldest in the area), but still had everything one could need. Breakfast is served under a thatched roof area, open air. We speculated on how everything would work in the event of rain, but never experienced an occasion to be able to comment. Fresh fruit, cereal and buns were available buffet style in the mornings along with hot breakfast choices selected from a menu. At breakfast, dinner options were displayed and special dietary requests could be made should the options conflict with dietary needs. Dinner was also partial buffet, partial order. Salads and soups and dessert were available buffet style, entrees made to order. Lunch can be ordered near the bar on the deck that overlooks the ocean. Down three steps from the deck are a single line of lounge chairs under the resorts palapas. There were always palapas and lounges available. The bar sometimes closed down early - open as late as midnight, but sometimes closed earlier. The pool is small with more lounge chairs. Often we were the only ones in the pool. A small resort like this immediately lends a sense of comfort and familiarity. My sister was able to allow her children to roam freely without worry. Staff were extremely helpful and friendly with tours and remembered our preferences at mealtimes. We cannot say enough good things about them. The resort may not have all the amenities of some of the larger places, but the beach cannot be beat and for tranquility, this is where its at. Now for my one complaint. I didn't notice this until I got back. So, the resort is unaware and no mention was made to them about this. When booking through expedia, we input all our data (need 3 rooms, number of people in each room - including the ages of the children). Then, expedia returned a number of options which include the \"average price per night.\" Only after hitting the booking button does the final total come up with the original rate and the taxes and the \"extra guest charge\" which was an additional $60/person/night. Since we input all the information and were comparing resorts, shouldn't this have been part of the \"average price per night\"? Two people extra (the kids) at $60/person/night works out to be $120/night or $840 for the week ($950 with tax)! That is more than another room would have cost. It raised the average price per night from $96 to $136 - not insignificant. Many of the other resorts include options to have two kids free! So, the quoted rates would have been accurate on theirs. Hopefully, armed with this information, you can go in with your eyes open -- this is a great little place.", "Date": "August 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oregon", "Title": "\u201cThe Best\u201d", "Author": "buchOregon", "ReviewID": "UR115937584", "Content": "Our sons and their families have spent the last two years vacationing at Petit Lafitte.

You can encounter travel glitches no matter where you go or where you stay. I am pleased that Ivan wrote such an insightful and honest response that cleared up the Holylander 'spin'. Let me tell you what type of place Lafitte is - About 6 years ago, I was staying at Capitan Lafitte when Hurricane Emily was on a collision course with Lafitte and Playa del Carmen. There were not enough flights for all visitors to leave in a 24 hour period. For our safety, Lafitte sent us to a near-by 5 star hotel that had an excellent Hurricane shelter, all expenses paid, for the remainder of our visit. We were pampered in a safe environment - we had a clean room, delicious cooked food (they had generators) and plenty of water to drink and bathe. WE DIDN'T PAY A NICKEL FOR ANY OF THIS. Lafitte paid the entire bill, including the transfer back to the airport. After we went to the airport to return home, we heard horror stories from guests of other hotels, some of them rather expensive places, who abandoned their guests, and whose management disappeared after the storm, leaving their guests without food, running water, and broken window-glass all over their rooms. In Playa, some hotel guests who took shelter at a school gymnasium were knee-deep in water. By contrast, we had been well-taken care of, beyond what I ever expected. I, and many friends, family and co-workers have been enjoying Capitan Lafitte, and now Petit Lafitte, for the past 20 years, every year. The staff are are nothing but accommodating and courteous in every manner, not to mention friendly. I've traveled to many places throughout the world, and Petit Lafitte is at the top of my list for location, service, accommodation, cleanliness, cuisine, ambiance, and for being totally 'sympatico' in every way. It's been perfect for us. It has always been a pleasure to sojourn at Capitan Lafitte and Petit Lafitte, we hope to visit again next Spring. Do not hesitate to enjoy this very special place, I guarantee you will not be disappointed. ps/ I rated the 'spa' as excellent because, altho they do not actually have a spa, they offer spa services and the masseuse (Berta) is wonderful !!", "Date": "July 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cYou can't go wrong!!!\u201d", "Author": "Igel6", "ReviewID": "UR115826582", "Content": "My wife and I traveled here with four children ages 9 to 16.

We had decided to stay there after reading other TripAdvisor reviews. We arrived in the evening on our first night, but just in time for dinner at the hotel's restaurant. Meal was good and the service was excellent. The hotel is fairly small, only 55 rooms and 18 bungalows, and so it was very quiet and private during our entire stay. The hotel is right off the beach, and has its own private beach with chairs and palapas for guests. There is also a nice, and clean (the staff was cleaning it every morning) pool. The grounds were very well kept also. Beach was nice and clean, though the beach area directly in front of the hotel was rocky, so you had to walk about 50 yards north in order to swim, but not a big deal. Water was crystal clear and jade colored just as the photos suggest, and calm during our entire trip. The hotel is a bit deep off the main highway, but it is a quick (15 min) taxi ride into the heart of Playa Del Carmen (5th Avenue). My wife and I made the trip into town about 3-4 times without incident. David, the hotel concierge is excellent and a very very nice guy. I often found myself chatting him up when we ran into him. The wait staff and other hotel staff are all very friendly as well!! Even though most of the other guests during our stay spoke fluent Spanish, we were never treated second class. The only advice I would give, is book your excursions to the ruins or other sites through the hotel. We made the mistake of booking through a fly-by-night operation in Playa Del Carmen. We enjoyed our stay and would recommend the hotel to anyone wanting an escape to a quiet, private resort. Thanks again to all the staff!", "Date": "July 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Birmingham, Alabama", "Title": "\u201cStay here once, and you will always want to come back!!\u201d", "Author": "AdamS909", "ReviewID": "UR115361053", "Content": "Stay here once, and you will always want to come back, seriously. My wife and I stayed in an ocean view bungaloo for 9 days the last week of October leading into November. From the airport, we were taken care of immediately and sent straight to the hotel. We arrived into a secluded jungle like area with smiles and ice cold tea. Check in was maybe 2 minutes, and within five our luggage was in our room, ac already on, and lounging at what I now consider the worlds best bar. The beach was excellent, and the water was perfect everyday. It is true you have to walk up the beach to get around the rocky part of the ocean directly infront of the hotel, but its honestly a 1 minute walk. It didnt bother us at all. Hotel Staff and Food: Every staff memeber knew my wife and I by name within two days, including the owner and chef! We aslo were engaged in conversation by the entire staff throughout the our trip. Not only would they set our trips up for us, something I would never let a hotel staff service normally do, but our trips to many of the ancient ruins were always ahead of the tour bus groups and considerably cheaper. Not to mention the locals driving us around took us to non-tourtisty locations for meals, etc. We also could not find anything to complain about whatsoever. I am incredibly picky, and my wife has a way about her too, but everything was terrific. Room cleaned everyday, showers were rustic but nice, and the beds were far better than most big name hotel chains. We even were given 6 liters of bottle water everyday at no extra charge. At one point in our trip, I even jokingly asked the owner if it would be possible to have some dark lager beer available at the bar during dinner one night, and by 8 am the next day, there was a case available. Food and Service: Cant beat it! We ate everywhere. Downtown Playa, in little back alley taco joints, food vendors, and big name resturants. We both concluded the food at Petite was just better. Something very homestyle about it, and very hearty. Breakfast had the best fruit, and a menu of options to choose from. Lunch and dinner were entirely different every day. However, there was a traditional selection that you could have whenever too. Try the Petite Tacos. Also, you could eat anywhere you like, on the beach, on your bungaloo patio, by the pool, you name it. Everyday we would have chips and salsa with a few beers in the afternoon on our patio. Actually, within two days, the staff would find us if we were on location, and asked if we wered ready for our mid-day snack. Amazing. Bar: One man in the whole world makes this place my favorite bar that I have ever experienced; Victor. This man makes the best Mojito I have ever tasted. And, he always has something interesting to talk about. Victor can make a whole group of strangers friends within just one night! Overall experience: As far as my wife and I are concerned, La Petit Lafitte is our Yucatacan homebase. If you like calm and refreshing, stay here. If you like mega hotels, with drunk frat boys and super crowded beaches then stay in Play Del Carmen's downtown hotels. Also, remember that the staff earns more of a living off of your tips then their hourly wage and they try very hard to help with your experience. I will upload pictures soon to give a better idea of the layout, but the photos on their website are very accurate. And yes, the water is that clear.There is so much more I can rant on about, including the animal preserve, and super fun staff, some fun with the locals during the \"Day of the Dead\" celebrations, a 2 hour walk home on the beach from playa or even visiting \"off the beaten path\" cenotes, but then I would ruin for you what my wife and I will always consider as one of the best times in our life!", "Date": "July 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Portland, Oregon", "Title": "\u201cWe highly recommend this wonderful place!\u201d", "Author": "hilary_almers", "ReviewID": "UR115344137", "Content": "My husband and I stayed here in June.

If that is what is most important to you, then you might want to move along. The accommodations were nice, comfortable, etc - but that wasn't why we went. With less then 50 rooms, you literally trip out of your room and land on the beach. A non-crowded beach.. because you're not competing for space with 800 other people. You can see & smell the ocean right from the deck & bar while eating the most amazing fish taco's i've ever had! And, just ask for a mojito - after 1 hour, the bar-tender not only remembered our names & room numbers - but knew exactly what we were drinking and had it whipped up in 2 minutes. The food is another factor that can't be over-looked. The room rate includes breakfast & dinner each day, and they do NOT skimp on the food.. it was amazing. Breakfast each morning includes about a dozen various choices.. along with fruit, yougurt & cereal included in a buffet. Dinner was also a various selection on entrees.. and the service was fantastic.

The staff is phenomenal, the food is great, the place is nice, and it's affordable. If you're looking for a place to get married, we highly recommend Petit Lafitte. Their attention to detail was outstanding - nothing was left out. They went out of their way to make sure everything was what we asked for. We really couldn't have asked for more. We found it to be a bonus that since we rented out a majority of the rooms, the hotel closed off the remaining vacant rooms. Thus, the resort was essentially ours. This created a really great vibe for the weekend and also made the wedding day more special, as there were no other weddings to compete with (as is often the case with big, all-inclusive resorts). The day after the wedding we moved to more \"posh\" resort a few hundred yards down the beach for a few days of post wedding R&R. We missed the staff, sopes, guacamole, and margaritas so much that we went back there for lunch both days. This hotel isn't for everyone - if you're in to the swank, hipster places, try elsewhere.

The service is superb. We had a late flight into Cancun and didn't arrive at the hotel until almost 10, but the kitchen prepared and saved individual dinners for us. The food at all meals was delicious. The mixed seafood ceviche was a perfect lunch. We stayed in bungalow #4 which was wonderful. Totally clean, comfortable bed, nice bathroom and shower, coffee maker for that first cup on our porch before breakfast, and then stepping off the porch directly onto the sand....Ahhhhhh.

I\u2019m not sure where to start. This little resort will have you wanting more even before you leave. It\u2019s been just over a week since we have been there and we are already thinking about our return trip. I will try and break this down in to sections so it\u2019s easier to under stand. Location: Petit Lefitte is just a few minutes North of Playa Del Carmen. There\u2019s a good reason for this. The beaches here are fantastic. The closer you get to Playa Del Carmen the beaches are more crowded and well\u2026 not as nice. The only reason to go to town is to enjoy the Club scene or to do some shopping. I\u2019m sure you could walk to the neighboring hotel and take in some shopping and dancing as well. Amenities: Beach \u2013 Yes, It\u2019s fantastic! Some of the better snorkeling spots we visited were right in front of the Hotel. Check out Google Maps/Earth. You will see a Moon shaped looking formation in the water. That\u2019s the one. Just a few steps in to the water and you will see some great fish. Food \u2013 Some of the best I have ever had. I can say without a doubt I am a picky eater. Everything I ate, I loved. The presentation, the portions, the service and the atmosphere were all top notch. The staff was attentive to our every need. They cooked special food for our six year old daughter every night. They were even willing to provide alternative dietary menus for some folks we met while staying at the hotel as well. Drinks \u2013 Oh yes! They definitely have those. Just ask Jesus or anyone else at the bar and they will take care of you. They serve some of the best Alcoholic and Non-Alcoholic drinks around. Hotel \u2013 We stayed in one of the Bungalows right off the beach. Yes, they are rustic. No there is not a T.V. in the bungalow units. But, how often are you in the room anyway? Most of the time we were on the front porch, in the hammocks, by the pool, at the bar, or eating some great food. Are you thinking about staying in one the Bungalows? All of them are great. Looking to stay close to the beach? Then choose: Ocean Front #9 or Ocean View #3,4,10 or 11. \u2013 The main hotel is great. Looking for easy walkways and wonderful rooms. Then choose any of the Ocean Front or Ocean View rooms. I would highly recommend these to anyone who is looking for easy mobility. We met a wonderful couple in there 70\u2019s who have been returning customers for many years and they come back annually. Actually, quite a few people we met had been returning patrons from years past. This really shows the quality of the staff, location, service and more. Massage \u2013 Worth it. As a middle-aged male, I am not the typical person that seeks out a \u201cgood massage\u201d. I have had a couple through the years and this one was by far the best I have ever had. You are right on the beach, listening to the ocean in the background, no loud music or any other disturbances to be heard. I would highly recommend it. Misc \u2013 Don\u2019t miss out on the small merchant on the edge of the hotel near the beach. He sells some wonderful pottery. You can also paint your own and he will glaze and fire it and have it ready for you the next day. Great for kids! Other things you may want to know? Should I rent a car? \u2013 No! If you are not use to driving in a foreign country then don\u2019t do it. We rented a car and driving wasn\u2019t the biggest issue. It was the overall use. We planned to visit downtown Playa many times and we never did. The hotel and the amenities nearby took care of most of our needs. Taxis are not that expensive. The hotel has some great folks they can call. The taxis are willing to stay with you the entire day and take you anywhere you want to go. Places to visit: Xcaret \u2013 Do you have young children? Do you want to visit an exotic zoo? Then go. We purchased the Plus Package with the Dolphin swim. Overall, it was nice. Would I do it again? No. The park itself is huge. It\u2019s a great place to snorkel, swim and see some wildlife. Don\u2019t expect more than that. We were told the \u201cshow\u201d in the evening is really spectacular. A few people at the hotel had said go to the \u201cshow\u201d and not the park. Hidden Worlds \u2013 Like extreme adventure? This is the place for you. Zip Lines, Rappelling, cave snorkeling in the senotes and more. Our six year old went on almost every adventure with us. However, She was not big enough for the \u201cAvatar\u201d. But, Don\u2019t forget to tip the staff. I will write a review about this under the Hidden worlds forum. Akumal \u2013 Hidden gem of a city. Go and snorkel the bay. It\u2019s free! Sea Turtles, Stingrays, and some really colorful fish. All ages can go here. Light waves in the bay and shallow water make it perfect. Great restaurants are located throughout. One in particular is La Buena Vida. It has indoor and outdoor seating with fantastic views. Coba \u2013 Mayan ruins you can actually touch. Prepare to spend the entire day here. We were unable to make it this trip. However, the reports were fantastic. Tulum Ruins \u2013 Great ocean views, spectacular settings. It\u2019s a great place to capture some breathtaking photos. Go early and bring your bathing suit. There\u2019s a great beach here. There are some stairs leading to the beach (so be warned). I spoke with several couples on the trip home. Most of them repeated similar horror stories of their stays at other resorts. The one that stuck in my mind was having to wake up early every morning, go down and claim a chair on the beach. This was the only way they had a place to put their stuff while they \u201cenjoyed\u201d the beach in from of their hotel. Go and enjoy. We miss it already. Thank you Petit Lefitte staff.

PL is a quiet, calm and beautiful place to spend hours in a hammock or by the pool reading and resting. You can walk for miles on the flour white beach but unfortunately the entire coastline is populated by the plastic and mammoth all-inclusive resorts which have hundreds (if not thousands) of beach chairs lined up elbow to elbow. The \"town\" of Playa del Carmen is now populated by almost 300,000 people -- it is no longer a fun, funky town but just a smaller version of tacky, noisy Cancun. Somehow PL has managed to carve out the last little bit of quiet seclusion between Cancun and Playa del Carmen. The staff is amazing...they work so very hard all day making sure everything is clean and comfortable. The food was fresh and delicious; varying between small buffets and personal table service. Breakfast was always my favorite because of the plentiful fresh fruit. Dinner included great soups, salad selections and a nightly choice of 2 entrees which included fish, chicken, beef or pasta. We never had a meal that we didn't enjoy. Bar & lunch aren't included in your room price, but both are inexpensive...the drinks are smooth and lunch is plentiful...couldn't get enough of the chips, guac and fresh salsa. We had an Ocean View bungalow which was clean, comfortable and spacious. Plenty of bottled water is provided each day and there is a small fridge stocked with sodas, juice and a candybar or two. There is free Wi-Fi on site but I had no desire to \"check-in\" with reality...isn't that the point of vacation? There is a dive center on-site which offers snorkeling trips and full-service diving and certifications. Inexpensive massages are a-plenty up and down the beach, but PL has a lovely little palapa right on the beach and an hour massage was only $40...it was the perfect way to start our vacation and helped the relaxation seep in quickly. By 9:00 each night we returned to our bungalow having exhaused ourselves with daily activites such as holding down a hammock and a beach chair, soaking up the sun, swimming in the ocean and taking long walks on the beach to find just the perfect seashell.

The food was excellent. Breakfast and dinner were included. Breakfasts included a selection of fresh fruit, yogurt and cereals as well as hot entrees including mayan omelets, heuvos rancheros and numerous other hot entrees-we had them all over the 2 weeks and they were delicious. Dinners rotate on a 2 week plan so we never had the same thing twice. There was soup and salad bar every night and usually a selection of 2 entrees to choose from that arrived piping hot to your table every night. There were also a selection of deserts every night or you could have ice cream. At lunch time they do serve a variety of sandwiches and burgers as well as mexican food which were very good. Our favorite lunch was ceviche with their complimentary torilla chips served with a garlic sauce and pico de gaillo. They have a small pool with ample shade and lounge chairs. There are about 10 palapas on the beach and lots of lounge chairs. We were usually able to find shade somewhere. As well there are 4 hammocks on their beach. The beach directly in front of the hotel is rocky but just to the north of the hotel is a beautiful sandy beach that my kids spent hours playing in. There is a small library with a pool table and ping pong table as well. Staff did lend us boogie boards as well. There is a zoo behind the hotel that is worth a visit. There is a masseuse who charges $40US for a 1 hour massage-well worth it. They have musicians play at dinner time 2 nights a week- I enjoyed both but particularly enjoyed the electric guitar/violin duet. The rooms were basic but a good size and fairly comfortable. We stayed in the hotel part-but there are several gungalows on the beach as well. The hotel is quite a walk from the highway. We rented a car and would recommend it if you plan on visiting the area. It was easy to find your way around. Our only glitch was getting ripped off at the Pemex gas station on 307 next to the Coca-cola plant. They created a diversion and distracted us then switched pesos on us-this resulted in us losing 200 pesos in the transaction. This is a fairly common scam that we had been aware of but they still got us. We would recommend taking the pesos out and saying exactly how many pesos worth of gas you want and stating clearly how many pesos you are handing over in the transaction.

Having been to a several all-inclusive resorts by now, I wanted to be in the Mayan Riviera with it's draws (great weather, the carribean sea, white sand, easy access from Toronto) but not the other elements found at the mega resorts (crowds, line-ups, excessive menu choices, low-quality beverages, noise.) I'd looked to TripAdvisor for recs for a winter holiday and reviews were consistent and in-line with what I was looking for. The PL seemed like an ideal option. This would be the first time not doing an AI vacation so there would be a bit more organizing to be done (researching flights, transfers, etc) but it turned out to be not much effort at all. My experience was spot-on with most reported here. ALL service personnel were friendly, attentive and kind people. Accommodations were charming, clean and there was definitely nothing lacking. We stayed in a gardenview bungalow and it was really quiet. The breakfasts and dinners were absolutely delicious and thoughtfully prepared and presented \u2013 over the seven nights of dinners I did not see a single salad repeated amongst the generous variety served. Mexican night was my favorite. Lunch (not included in the room rate but reasonable) was a pleasant experience given the quality of the food, drink and beachfront setting. There\u2019s a modest pool and beachfront with plenty of loungers for everyone, so no jockeying for space or planning your day around getting a towel down early enough in the morning. That said getting up to watch the sunrise made for one of the best parts of the day sitting on the beach deck enjoying coffee with fellow early birds. The other guests were friendly and chilled-out, whether they\u2019d been coming here for twenty years or new visitors. Seniors, couples, and young families with children all were part of the gang. Other info that may be worth repeating: Walking along the beach to Playa del Carmen in the early morning (taking about an hour and half) made for a great self-made excursion. Interesting to pass the massive property developments along the way as well as what's left of undeveloped tracts of beachfront. Cab rides back from PdC weren't complicated as most taxi drivers know where the hotel is, and if not would know the Princess resort which is the same turn off the highway. Rates are fixed. Didn\u2019t make it to the zoo until the last day and should have gone sooner. The true value of the Petit Lafitte is its simplicity. Whether you were in the three-storey building or one of the bungalows the beach was no further than a minute away. There is not much to do here other than to rest, relax, and restore. With no TV and noise at night bedtime was usually by 9pm and lots of people were out at the beach for sunrise. Nine to ten hour sleeps... This is on top of the siestas after a full day at the playa before dinner.

The hotel staff was extremely helpful -- David coordinated all of our excursions for us, and even packed us breakfast-to-go on a day we had to leave early. There are a few negatives to the hotel that I think I should mention. It's location -- it is far from the road and so you cannot easily walk to catch the bus. But we got taxis through the hotel, and so met some wonderful people in our drivers. One of the drivers stayed with us for the entire day -- driving us to Coba, a cenote, and Tulum. He was related to one of the owners of Petit, and had great stories to tell -- especially about the zoo there. The beach right in front of the hotel is very rocky. But you just walk to the left and you hit a sandy section. There isn't a whole lot to do on the beach other than lay there, drink, and get burned. So what's wrong with that? I fear that my two teenagers would have gotten bored had we done that for more than a day and 1/2. So we did a lot of excursions -- to the ruins, Xel Ha, Xcaret.

We chose this hotel based upon the great reviews on TripAdvisor. My husbad and I have also stayed at what used to be called ShangriLa Caribe (now called Mahekal Beach Resort) which is owned by the same company, so we sort of knew what to expect from the place. We had a really great time and felt the resort worked out very well for our family. The best part about the resort, in my opinion, was actually the other people staying there. Several other families with young children were at PL at the same as we were, so the kids all made fast friends and the adults got to know one another and hung out together quite a lot. By the end of the trip, we were all sitting together at large tables at dinner. It was great. Even those staying at PL who did not have kids were all so friendly. I'm certain I've never met so many people on a vacation before. The kids all loved the zoo as well. We took our boys over once in the morning and again in the afternoon. Bring bug spray! I agree with all the other reviewers that the staff was quite nice (a few waiters weren't as friendly and outgoing as I expected, but that's ok) and the food was very good. We ate lunch at the resort every day and asked for variations on some things they had on the menu. They were happy to oblige. A few things: If you decide to rent a car, be aware that the insurance costs are not included in the rates that you get when you go to the car rental companyies' web sites. This additional cost almost doubles the rate you get online. Be very clear what insurance your credit card provides before showing up at the agency. We rented a car partly because we were uneasy about the fact that the shuttle only had a carseat for our 2 year old but not our 4 year old. Turned out that the carseats provided by Dollar in our rental car were an absolute joke. If that is something you are a stickler about, you'll want to bring your own. If you do rent a car, there is a Walmart in Playa where you can pick up anything you need. There is a small fridge in the bungalows with some room for beer or juiceboxes, etc. so that really comes in handy. If you think you'll mainly stay at the resort, just pay for the shuttle. The car rental is not worth it. Bring sippy cups if traveling with young children. The resort did not have lids for cups so it was good we had a few with us. PL gives you all the bottled water you need and you can get apple juice or orange juice at the bar all day long. The massage therapists were offering a special of two one-hour massages for $80. My husband and I took advantage of this and were not disappointed. There is a little cabana right on the beach where they do the massages. So nice!! You pay the women directly in US dollars.

The hotel was tiny compared to most Playa Del Carmen resorts (just 46 rooms) but we found it to be an absolutely perfect size \u2013all the rooms are a twenty second walk to the beach (or, better yet, ten second walk to the bar). The most important thing to know about this hotel is that the service was top notch! The staff was incredibly helpful and friendly (and fluent in English). The food was absolutely fantastic! Breakfast and dinner are included in the price \u2013 breakfast was a buffet of fruit, some cereal, then a full menu of mostly Mexican breakfast items (all were delicious). Dinner consisted of a soup and salad bar, a selection of a main course (which varied each night), and dessert. As an extra bonus, they were easily able to accommodate my wife\u2019s gluten intolerance \u2013 the concierge made a point to find her every morning to work out any menu modifications that might be necessary to remove flour. Most of the food did not contain flour, but if it did (typically in the soups or sauces) they offered to make up a special dish for her as a substitute. Lunch and drinks were not included, but both were available for a very reasonable price from the poolside/beachside bar. The drinks were all made with top shelf liquor\u2026no watered down all-inclusive drinks here (the margaritas are really worth it!). The rooms are simple and basic, but still very comfortable and spacious with a firm bed, mini fridge, desk, dresser, window AC unit in the wall, ceiling fan, and TV. The rooms were a bit dim, as they were primarily lit by the sliding glass door leading to the porch. Views were primarily of the bar and pool area below. The water at the hotel is not filtered (not terribly surprising) but each room is stocked with 1.5L bottles of water (free of charge). The hotel has wifi, but the only way we could connect in our room was out on the porch (signal was too weak). There were two PCs in the \"lobby\" that were available for use (but no printer). The hotel has a small pool with a dozen chairs surrounding it. By the bungalows, there are numerous hammocks for relaxing and plenty of beachfront chairs. The beach was deserted \u2013 there was no need to jockey for chairs with an umbrella as there were plenty to go around and more chairs than people. The hotel is far enough from the main part of Playa that there are no beach vendors hassling you to get hair braids or pet an iguana; and the nearest other hotels are far enough away that the beach feels relatively private and secluded. As far as ocean swimming is concerned, there\u2019s some exposed coral in front of the hotel which prevents swimming, but just down the beach a few hundred feet is a fine stretch of sand to swim on. We opted to rent a car and drive (since the cost was similar to an airport shuttle) and the hotel had ample parking on site. We thought we\u2019d want to drive into Playa for lunch from time to time but found that eating at the bar was far more pleasant. Petite Lafitte is not for everyone. If you\u2019re looking for a large resort with lots of activities going on then this isn\u2019t it.

Here at Lafitte\u2019s you will not find jet skis, hundreds of lounge chairs nor will you find pesky wrist bands to identify you amongst the literally thousands of guests. No, here you will be at home; one of the family. Lafitte\u2019s is not going to be for everybody, but if you value a paradise that is relaxed, unassuming and personal then you might very well have found your next Mexican vacation destination. Upon arrival I was amazed that even after 7 years the staff remembered me; this is the kind of personal touch you can expect here. Here, the staff wants to know you, where you\u2019re from and more about you than just whether or not you want salt on your margarita. If you wish quiet anonymity you can have it but trust me, the staff here is wonderful. The main resort features a smallish three-story hotel that looks charming, white against the Caribbean blue skies. This area is also home to a sparkling pool that\u2019s surrounded by a lush garden. Here in the central courtyard you\u2019ll find the restaurant area serving breakfast and dinner each day, more about that in a bit. At the far end of the courtyard, near the beach is a quaint little bar where you can mingle with other guests as well as enjoy the best margaritas in Mexico. The other side of the resort is the cabana section; here a growing number of private and simple cabanas begin at the beach and continue around to face a garden area. Currently there are 18 cabanas but there are still a few under construction. We stayed here and I will say that it was peaceful and charming. The cabanas themselves are fairly basic, wood construction with either two double beds or one king (we chose the king) our cabana also had a loft area with an additional bed. The cabana was clean, simple and a great place to come home to each evening. Days start at Lafitte with breakfast, and they should not be missed. There is always a buffet of fresh fruits, yogurt, pastries, a tasty granola mix and freshly squeezed orange juice. If that isn\u2019t enough, by all means count on one of the breakfast entrees on the menu; the molletas, omelets and yes the French toast are personal favorites. Don\u2019t forget to linger with a cup of coffee while you let your day begin slowly. Afterwards, make your way to the beach to savor the crystal clear waters of the Caribbean. There is an area with a sandy bottom perfect for splashing around in the warm water or if you\u2019d like, there are areas with coral that will allow limited snorkeling as well. Either way, when you step out of the sea you will have your choice of reclining on a beach chair in the open sun or one of the palaps on the beach. Don\u2019t overlook the hammocks that are available as well, very comfy, perfect places for a nap. Since lunch is not included in the room rate, you can either order something from the bar, which offers a great variety of Mexican dishes or you can take a car or taxi into Playa del Carmen and try out one of the many restaurants there. As the sun begins to set you\u2019ll likely find many of the guests gravitating to the bar area for those amazing margaritas, ice-cold cervecas or even a surprisingly good glass of vino blanco. Whatever your taste in libation, Victor of Jesus will be sure that you\u2019re happy. After a cocktail, its back to the dining area to savor the amazing cuisine that is native to this area. The food in a word is fabulous. You will be treated to homemade soups and salads as a first course followed by a selection of either of two dinner entrees along with dessert. Prepare to enjoy and savor dinner as you look out from under the thatched roof at picture perfect evenings. As I said in the beginning, this isn\u2019t a mega resort; there isn\u2019t a casino, nightclub, disco or any other distraction that would intrude upon the perfect simplicity of your Mexican holiday. After dinner, let your evening wind down with one last margarita before returning the tranquility of your cabana or room, savoring the rhythmic sound of the sea. In the end Petit Lafitte not only met our expectations but exceed them as well. The resort is an ideal getaway, tranquil and relaxing; the staff is wonderful, very friendly and genuine (bear in mind that some of the staff has been here for over 20 years); and the people you meet here, we had great conversations with people from other snowy locales like Minnesota and Pennsylvania as well as from New Mexico, Montana and Washington DC; the common denominator is that they are all here because they seek a tranquil paradise and at Petit Laffite they\u2019ve found it! Chances are if you seek something different, someplace special that will feel like home you\u2019ll enjoy it too.", "Date": "February 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Minneapolis, MN", "Title": "\u201cWe can't wait to return to Petit Lafitte!\u201d", "Author": "elder1923", "ReviewID": "UR95558499", "Content": "My wife and I just returned from a 5-night stay at Petit Lafitte. We specifically booked this hotel based on Tripadvisor reviews. We were not dissapointed! All the previous reviews are right on. We enjoyed every minute of our stay. We stayed in one of the hotel rooms, a garden view king room on the third floor. We had a nice view of the pool and we even had a sliver of view of the sea. Like other reviewers have mentioned, the rooms are VERY basic, but clean and functional. The finishes could use some updating, but for the price we paid we feel the rooms were just fine. The price of your stay includes all the bottled water you want. The rooms also have a coffee maker, and free wifi. The wifi was functional and fast the throughout our stay. Besides the room, everything else exceeded our expectations. The staff did everything possible to make our stay enjoyable, and they did a fantastic job. They were accomodating in every way. Breakfast and dinner were included in the price of our stay, and they were very good. We looked forward to each meal. There was consistently good variety. Lunch was not included but we ate lunch just about every day at the seaside bar and grill. The fish tacos were out of this world. I don't think they were on the menu but order them anyway. Javier will be happy to accomodate. The beach here is quiet and absolutely perfect. There was good swimming and snorkeling right off the beach. Wy wife and I also both got messages right there on the beach, and I would highly recommend this as well! We also made some new friends both with some of the guests and the staff. There's a very intimate feel to this place and you'll quickly make new friends with other guests. Overall, I can't say enough about this great little resort. If you're looking to get away and enjoy quiet time at the beach, great food and drinks (awesome mojitos!), and getting to know some new folks, this is the place.

Once we arrived, Felipe greeted us and showed us to our Bungalow #3 which was just passed the hammock hut and beach chairs and no more than 150 yards from the immaculate water - very clean, and comfortable. After settling in, we met and made instant friends with a number of other families and couples enjoying drinks at the seaside cantina where Victor and Jesus' savory margaritas and mojitos are only outdone by the amazing tropical setting and friendly atmosphere.

Mouth watering soups, fresh salads and veggies, and entrees of beef, pork, chicken, fish - all culminating on our last night with the Christmas Eve buffet feast which topped them all!!!

For lunch, the cantina menu offered a variety of Mexican and American fare which more than satisfied our individual tastes - definitely recommend the ceviche!

The kids played in the water, rested on tubes, built sand castles, and played \"hammock wars\" or hide and seek with the other kids and mom and dad had no concerns as the property is open and safe with staff knowling exactly who everyone is/belongs to. The zoo was incredible, as the kids were able to feed several of the exotic animals - what great pictures and memories!

It all seemed to work so effortlessly. For me, it was five stars all around. It's a jewel set in the Mexican Carribean.

When my daughter and son-in-law suggested Petit Lafitte for a relaxing holiday, we just didn't know if it was right for us! Honestly, we loved this place the service was just great and the food pretty good. We could not believe that during our 13 day stay the soup was never repeated and every soup delicious - kudos to the Chef(s). From the very top to the staff everyone was very personable and took the time to learn customer's names even though sometimes that can be a challenge! At the reception area they always took care of any need you might have. Conceirge David from the time he handed the key made sure everything was A OK! Victor and Jesus at the bar were very friendly and made sure your thirst for water, drinks or food was always taken care of. We enjoyed the Coconut water daily as per our request. Lourdes who made up the rooms daily was very pleasant and there was never a want of anything. My grandchild made herself right at home and her needs and the needs of my sick husband were always attended to. The wonderful treat for old and young is the Zoo and although the surface was uneven it added to the natural habbitat for the animals and birds. Even the internet was available at all times. I would recommend this hotel to my friends for a relaxing and safe holidays with terrific service at all times. The other visitors at Petit were all so friendly and helpful and it felt like being with family. This place is so safe and away from the hustle and bustle of tourists crowds. The only con was that since the roads are in process of being modernized, the taxi rides to and fro were a little rough. Once completed it will be smooth sailing. I personally feel if you want to do a lot of sightseeing, etc. the best deal would be to rent a car.

I went there with my husband, our 1 1/2 year old daughter, and my parents in November 2010. We were coming from Oaxaca, Mexico and my parents from New Jersey, USA. It was a nice meeting point for all of us. Before we even got there, we were treated kindly by the reservations manager, Luis, offering us any kind of information, whether petty or not, about our stay and the accomodations necessary (especially with our daughter). When we got to the hotel, we were met by the concierge, David, who kindly explained and showed us everything at the hotel. David went beyond his duties to buy us some Tylenol for our baby girl who got fever during the trip. I was worried about making our first trip with our daughter to a hotel, but every one was so kind with her. She loved hugging and kissing the staff and vice versa. This to me is priceless and cannot be found in other hotels. Also, of our 2 week stay, there was only one day that our daughter did not have a play companion. There were always kids, and it made for a nice family-style atmosphere. The kitchen staff and wait staff is incredible. The food is remarkable and there is a nice variety for everyone. Thanks, Martin, Balde, Giovany, Manuel and Javier. You'll find the same treatment at the bar with wonderful service from the bartenders, Jesus and Victor, and lunch waiters. You can eat lunch at the bar or on the deck depending on what you prefer. And the options for lunch are fantastic. You have to try the shrimp tacos! We had the plan where breakfast and dinner were included, but since we spent most of our days there, we ate lunch at the bar as well. I totally recommend getting the plan with dinner included as dinner is truly the event of the day. Our cleaning lady, Lulu, made special extra effort to make towel figures for our little girl, and she always left the room immaculate. Because my parents have trouble walking, it was nice to be in such a cozy hotel. EVERYTHING (bar, reception, restaurant, beach, pool) were EXTREMELY close to our rooms.

We had a wonderful time and are considering making a week-stay at Petit Lafitte an annual tradition. First, it is important to note that this is not a luxury all-inclusive hotel. There are no mega swimming pools, no performances at night, no parties on the beach, no mile-long buffet of food. What Petit Lafitte is: a small, semi-secluded hotel with everything you need to enjoy a week basking in the Caribbean sun. This type of hotel is perfect for a family with small children because, unlike the mega resort hotels, your room is a 30-second walk from the beach. You do not need to take a shuttle to the beach, and you don't have to collect all your gear and tote it to the beach with you. When you're ready to use some snorkel equipment, just go to your room and get it. Need a sweater or different shoes? Run back to your room to get it. While you are on the beach, the staff at the beach-side bar will periodically check to see if you need a drink and bring it out to you for what I thought was a very reasonable price. Because of the hotel's small size, there is little competition for the hotel's shades and beds on the beach. The atmosphere is that of a slow-paced, relaxing vacation. No loud music, no disco balls, no binge drinking. Instead, it is a quiet, happy retreat. Think pina coladas, massages on the beach, and the sound of waves crashing. As far as location goes, the hotel is just north of Playa del Carmen and a 35-40 minute drive from the airport. Although the hotel does provide a shuttle service, I thought the service was quite costly and would recommend instead renting a car as we did. However, please note that the access road to the hotel is a dirt road (supposedly will be paved soon) that I think would be difficult to traverse in an economy-sized car. We had a Jeep Liberty, which worked quite well. Aside from saving the cost of the hotel's shuttle from the airport, having a rental car allows you to leave the hotel and travel to your choice of destinations (Chichen Itza, Xcaret, Tulum, etc.) without paying the price for a tour package. As far as the rooms go, they are basic rooms, but very comfortable. We stayed in two hotel rooms, rather than in one of the beach bungalows. We loved having a balcony or terrace with a little table and chairs. It allowed us to put our children to bed and then play scrabble on the balcony. The beds were comfortable, the air conditioning units worked well, the shower had plenty of hot water and good water pressure. The rooms were very clean, and the bedding was nice. There is an in-room mini fridge, an in-room safe, an iron, and free in-room Wi-Fi (as well as a shared computer available to use). Filtered, purified drinking water is provided daily for free, and you can always ask for more if you want more. Aside from daily maid service, there is free beach towel service so that you can have clean beach towels every morning. There is laundry service available. I wouldn't have the hotel do a whole load of laundry, but the prices were reasonable for washing a couple of pieces if necessary. I would bring your own shampoo and conditioner, as the provided miniature shampoo bottles were not what I suspect most women would like to use on their hair. (My husband, however, didn't seem to mind.) The food is quite good, most of the time. The normal rate for this hotel includes breakfast and dinner. We booked during a promotional period in which you could get a garden view room, with only breakfast included, for a good deal. The breakfast was great. At the buffet, you could get yogurt, fruit, Mexican breads and pastries, fresh orange juice, cereal, granola. On top of all this, each person could order one hot dish--omelets, eggs prepared many different ways, french toast, etc. This was my son's favorite meal because he loved eating familiar pancakes and french toast. We loved breakfasts here. (One strange note: the french toast was made with the same bread offered at dinner, which is flavored with rosemary and basil. It is hardly noticeable in the french toast because of the cinnamon dusted over it, but strange nonetheless.) Although our rate did not include dinner, we opted on two nights to pay for dinner. Dinner is a four-course meal with a salad/vegetable, soup, main course, and dessert. Sometimes the first, second, and dessert courses are served buffet-style, sometimes they are brought to your table. The main course (you have a choice of two different entrees) is always brought to the table. We thought that the food on one night was very very good and on the other night just okay. Since we only had dinner twice, this is probably not a very representative sampling of the food. Our son was always very hesitant to eat any of the food served for dinner because he was tired and wanted more familiar food, but the staff was happy to bring out a quesadilla for my son. All the fruits and vegetables are washed in an iodine solution. No one in my party had any stomach problems. The service is what really sets this place apart. The staff learned all of our names, including our two kids' names. One of the waiters at the bar (which serves grill food at lunch) brought my son a cup of ice cream as a complimentary surprise one day at lunch. If there was ever a problem, it was immediately resolved. Everyone was very friendly with our children, and we never felt like our children were a nuisance to anyone. There was a port-a-crib available for us to use. When my mother asked for off-menu items at breakfast (plain, instead of flavored yogurt, for example, or hot chocolate), the staff accommodated her request. All in all, Petit Lafitte proved to be the perfect retreat for our family. In fact, we had only booked a three night stay at Petit Lafitte but ended up staying for six nights after a brief jaunt to Merida and realizing how great we had it at Lafitte.", "Date": "November 21, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Santa Rosa, California", "Title": "\u201cNatural, wonderful.\u201d", "Author": "77wildhorses", "ReviewID": "UR87559002", "Content": "I am VERY particular. I ruin trips with my dissatisfactions. It's a fault, I know, but my expectations are high. So, when I say that Petit Lafitte is wonderful, that's the kind of eye I'm applying. We stayed in an ocean view bungalow. It is \"rustic\" as others have mentioned. By which, I mean, hand-crafted, not The Ritz.. More comfortable, earthy. We walked off our porch onto the beach sand. The gardens are beautiful, the beach amazing. No towering hotels next door. The meals are lovely and service is 5 star. Everything you need. Opposite vibe of the all-inclusive resort, but with some of the things that you do want like planned included meals. One thing, the loft bed in the bungalow was really uncomfortable. A high-density foam mattress would have solved that. We ended up just all piling into the king bed. If you are planning on using the loft for sleeping, you should inquire about the particular bed. Also, I should say, I missed a bathtub--our bungalow only had a shower. The place was very quiet and had only a few guests when we were there. But, I think it would be quiet and peaceful no matter when you went. That's the vibe of the place. Our kids loved the zoo. They're still working on it, pathways are incomplete and materials are piled here and there. But, my daughter didn't notice those things, she noticed the baby chicks and laughed at me trying to catch them for her to hold. We had to visit the zoo every morning. The kids collected coconuts, played hide-and-go-seek, and played on the hammocks while we had drinks. The road to Lafitte IS bad. They are working on it but just get Cesar to drive you though. Ask the hotel about him. You are on vacation and he is lovely. I had to work while I was there. I couldn't get consistent Internet in my bungalow, so was forced to go out and watch the sunrise while working at the bar...steps away from the sea.

I found Petit Lafitte through Trip Advisor and it fit the bill perfectly. I booked a bungalow and got a 40% discount for booking online through one of their promotions. Didn't have to wear shoes at all. Step out of the bungalow right into the sand. The bungalows were great. Clean, cute and very comfortable. The lights were a little dim, but nothing a few new bulbs couldn't fix. Shower big enough for two, bottled water in the room. Between the AC and the fan, it wasn't hard to get comfortable. In addition to beds, table and chairs in room, safe, coffee maker, night stand, mini frig, ironing board. We even found a few candles for ambience that got pressed into service when the electricity went off for a few hours. How romantic! Table and chairs on the deck out front, with a great railing for drying bathing suits/towels. Coconut trees dot the property, and they fall down frequently. The staff will hack one open for you and make you a coco loco. Hammocks hang throughout the property. Probably the greatest thing about Petit Lafitte is the staff. Felipe welcomes you at the front desk, gives a little tour of the property and shows you to your room. The food was outstanding, and the bar/waitstaff extremely attentive. Javier, Martin, Geovanny, Baldy and the other guys who moved too quickly for me to catch their names were wonderful! The beach in front of the resort was beautiful. A little rocky directly in front, but go 50 feet north and it wasn't rocky. . How could you complain when the water was about 80 degrees... We could see Cozumel across the water from Petit Lafitte. Walked up and down the beach, saw the other hotels/resorts and was very happy I picked Petit Lafitte. Dive shop/Spa facilities right on the property, nice big pool. Not very crowded the first week in Nov. Good time to visit. Can't wait to go back. Kind of nervous about all the violence being reported in Mexico, but I felt very safe, and was told by numerous people that the Riviera Maya is not where the problems are. The road leading to Petit Lafitte is a disaster zone, but under construction. I don't think the bandits would be able to find the place! (our taxi broke down about 1/2 mile from the hotel, so we had to schlep our luggage the rest of the way, which was amusing.....what are you gonna do?) The road construction was also the reason for the power outage while we were there, but the bar and restaurant never lost power, only the bungalows. It was actually kind of fun.

Usually we stay at big all inclusives. We have stayed in Cancun all the way South to Xpu Ha. We use TA all the time to study up and prepare for where to stay. However, this is my first review. Everytime we drive to Playa we see the sign for Petit Lafitte, and think to ourselves that we need to check that place out. In the past, we have been afraid to go out of the box and try something different. This time, we sure are glad that we did. We booked through the hotel website and got a good deal for the \"low\" season. 35% off of the oceanview bungalow, plus another 5% off because we booked on a Thursday. We used Suncountry to fly out of Dallas, and USA Transfers to get us to the hotel. Both went smoothly. When we arrived at the check in desk Felipe, and David greeted us, and checked us in. We then decided to upgrade to the oceanfront cabana. This was an anniversary trip without the kids, so we figured, why not? Plus we got a great deal on that too. I took my shoes off on Wednesday when we arrived and didn't put them on until we had to check out on Sunday. What a great way to spend a vacation! The best pedicure available by nature. I also had my first ever hot stone massage on the beach by Berta. It was heavenly to lay there and listen to the waves. Our cabana #2 was clean, spacious, private, with comfortable beds. We expect firm beds in Mexico, but this was much better than expected. It had a mini fridge with bottled water, soda, snacks. The room had an ironing board, iron, safe and plenty of towels. The A/C worked very well. We even slept with the windows open a few nights so we could hear the waves. We found the food to be very good, as well as the drinks. Victor, and Jesus at the bar make great margaritas! They have both been with the Lafitte family for many years, and it showed. By the end of our first day, the entire staff new our names and what bungalow we were in. There were only 12 people there when we were there. Two couples were in the hotel section, and the rest in the cabanas. The pool was refreshing and clean. The beach was very nice with a lot of hammocks to relax in. It also had a lot of shade for my hubby. The water was pretty stirred up from the wind, so I didn't get to snorkel as I couldn't see. Although we have stayed in 5 star fancy hotels in Cancun, and Playa, we would probably choose this one again. It was incredibly relaxing, great food and drinks, very private, and you can't beat the staff, and location. Since we were only there 4 nights, we didn't do any excursions. We have done most of them in the past anyway. This was to be a relaxing vacation for us, and we couldn't have asked for more. We got exactly what we were expecting, and more! Yes, the road to the resort is bad, we knew that going in and didn't really care. This place felt like home to us, and we can't wait to go back.

There are 5 buildings, each with 6 rooms. Building 1 is closest to the lobby and building 5 is closest to the beach. We could not stay in building 5, as they were doing some maintenance on those rooms. We had a nice ocean view from our room. Only obstructed by palm trees. The room was basic, but clean and plenty of drinking water is provided. The hot water in the shower is more tepid than hot. I did not like the beds. Very hard. There was a nice plush comforter that we ended up using to sleep on top of, to make the bed a little softer. We looked at the bungalow rooms. They look really nice and rustic. Number 9 looked to be the best to me. Close to the beach, lots of shade. 2 and 3 are nice location as well. The newer ones in the back have less shade and are further from the beach.

We went to an amazing destination wedding in PdC in 2006 so we knew what the area had to offer, but we also did a lot of internet research on what was available. We decided to stay at Petit Lafitte and planned on being there for a few nights maximum, and then planned to stay at one or two more places during our 8 day trip (all while visiting other hotels during the day). But after experiencing Petit, we decided to stay there for all 8 nights. We still looked at other resorts during our trip, but Petit was the perfect fit for us: a beautiful setting with amazing friendly service and fantastic food! It was just such a peaceful, friendly atmosphere that we knew we had found our spot, especially after meeting the staff, the manager Ivan, and seeing how they treat their guests and each other. Petit Lafitte is a small beachside resort with your choice of bungalows or hotel-style rooms, but it didn't feel small, it felt cozy and intimate. We stayed in a bungalow and loved it, but we also saw inside the hotel-type room and would have been very happy there as well. Both are very roomy and clean. All bungalows and hotel rooms have either a private terrace or balcony, and they're all literally seconds from the beach (and the pool and the bar and the restaurant!). The beach and the ocean were beautiful and peaceful and if that were all this resort could boast, it would be worth it. But it has so much more going for it. We were absolutely blown away by the resort staff and their service! We made so many connections with the staff and are on first-name basis with many of them. We were also amazed by the food. Breakfast and dinner are included in the all-inclusive price and the meals were fantastic! We spent one week there, and felt no need to go into town for dinner at a fancy restaurant because the food at Petit was so delicious and we wanted to see what the talented chef Gaspar and his staff had in store for us! There is also a lunch menu, and one day we had the best ceviche we've ever had (and we've had some pretty good ceviche living in NYC)! We went into town one day for shopping, and PdC is fun as always, lots to do and see and buy, if you ever need a \"break\" from relaxing on the beach. And it was only a ten minute cab ride from Petit into town. Unlike many of the other beachside hotels we visited in PdC, Petit Lafitte has an \"undiscovered\" feel to it. The beach is not crowded at all, because it isn't sandwiched between other hotels. Simply put, Petit Lafitte is a beautiful, clean, quiet and peaceful resort with fantastic food and sincere and friendly service...all for a very reasonable price.

If you want personal service, attention to detail, no hassle and wonderful Mexican Riviera beach vacation you need to BOOK YOUR STAY NOW. First, we can't give a perfect score as there was a mix up on our reservation. After much research, we reserved Bungalow #3 several months in advance of our trip, and found upon arrival that it was occupied. Luckily there were other Bungalows available and were placed in one that was still close to the beach. Our family (my wife and I and 2 girls 16 and 13) are accustomed to an Outer Banks summer vacation with a property right on the beach. We had not as a family been to Mexico, so we wanted the perfect stay for us - no night life and partying, plenty of beautiful beach and opportunity for daily beach activities. The reviews on tripadvisor really told us everything about what Petit Lafitte had to offer and we were sold. The Bungalow is just that - don't expect fancy linens and posh surroundings - these are cabins on the beach, people - love them for what they are! You can check out pictures on their website so you know exactly what you're getting. For me, there is nothing like waking up, walking right out your door onto the sand straight to the beautiful turquoise Caribbean water 30 yards away (after heading for coffee). It wasn't crowded at all during our mid August stay, never had any issue with trying to run out and reserve beach chairs. I won't go into how the staff gets to know you personally and has your names down in 1 days time, learns your favorite food selections (thanks for the extra chocolate swirl bread Baldy!) and seizes every opportunity to make your stay special. OK here's something you won't get at the Royal Hacienda resort just up the beach - my 13 year old found a fallen coconut one morning after a storm the night before. We tried and tried to break it open but there was no way. We were talking about it at breakfast, the staff overheard us. Next thing we knew Martin professionally prepared a coconut cut fresh from the tree and voila - parasol and all - we will never forget it. Yes we ventured out one day of our 5 day stay to do the interactive thing with the dolphins. The staff recommended Puerto Aventouras (~20-30 min drive, like a SeaWorld kind of destination) as the best place and it was wonderful. We had the bus driver drop us off in Playa Del Carmen afterwards where we shopped and ate dinner at Senor Frogs - it's right on the beach where the ferry is to Cozumel. We had no need for a rental car for our length of stay. We will try one of the other local restaurants in town next time :) I've read the reviews of folks complaining about not being able to find the place and the dirt road getting there (potholes and all) and other issues. Simple solution: book the airport transfers ahead of time and you will have no problem - just sit back and enjoy the ride and surroundings. Oh and the food - wonderful breakfast selections including fruit (wonderful Mangos!) and my favorite the Spanish Omellette. Thanks David and all of the staff for a wonderful first time family beach vacation to Mexico. You all do a fine job and we can't wait to come back and see you again.", "Date": "October 5, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "California", "Title": "\u201cBungalow Heaven!!!\u201d", "Author": "wand3r3r", "ReviewID": "UR81872945", "Content": "We just returned home from our trip to Playa del Carmen. Because of an apparent glitch in the Petit Lafitte's website, I was only able to book 4 nights in a Garden Bungalow. Their website was not showing Garden Bungalows available for 5, 6, 7, or 8 nights. We ended booking the remaining 4 nights of our stay at La Tortuga Hotel (see separate review under that hotel). Anyway, it's a shame because it turns out there were Garden Bungalows available for our complete stay. Next time we will call to verify availability. I don't want to repeat a lot of what has been reviewed previously except to say that all of the excellent reviews were well deserved. We loved the place. We have stayed in a large variety of bungalows throughout the world, some more costly and some less. But I must say that PL\"s bungalows were one of the nicest. They keep the bungalows spotless. The mattresses are firm just the way we like them. Bottled water is provided free-of-charge. Our bungalow #8 was situated such that the minute you stepped off the veranda, you were literally standing in the sand. We loved the food too. Our rate included the half-board meal plan. The breakfasts were delicious and filling. The dinners were awesome. I still dream of the medallions of beef cooked in a hibiscus sauce. Yummy and so tender you could cut it with a fork. A big thank you to the Chef. Service was top notch. David first showed us around and kind of took us under his wing to make sure everything was just right.. Jesus might make a mean margarita but we loved his mojitos with the \"secret\" ingredient! One night a light bulb burnt out in our room and we mentioned it to the front desk before dinner. By the time we finished dinner and returned to our bungalow, the bulb had already been replaced and was burning bright to welcome us back. The only drawback to the PL is the road to the hotel. It's a dirt road for much of the way once you get off the main highway and it's full of potholes. It makes the going even more difficult after a rainstorm as the potholes become swimming pools. We had more than one taxi driver or tour van driver cursing under their breath at the road. Maybe PL keeps it this way to keep the hotel a \"hidden secret\"? I will end by saying that our type of vacation usually is about exploring new places. We just don't go the same place twice. The highest compliment I can pay to PL and its staff is we can't wait to return!!!", "Date": "October 2, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco, California", "Title": "\u201cA perfect end to our trip\u201d", "Author": "HeatherBuchheim", "ReviewID": "UR81001913", "Content": "My partner and i spent the last full day of our vacation at this beautiful resort.

Petit Lafitte fits the bill. A quiet place just north of downtown Playa del Carmen ; about 45-50 minutes south of the Cancun airport. Awesome beach; and we enjoyed the bungalow lodging 200 yards from the water; loved the breakfasts and dinner (and we could barely finish all the food served to us). Staff was exceptional! Totally took care of us -- stellar service and surpisingly great food at breakfast and dinner (included in the room rate we were quoted). My friend and I were there during the very low season; we got a great rate and we were some of the only guests at the hotel for the week after Labor Day. As a result, we felt like we had the place to ourselves; beach was nearly empty; staff was particularly attentive and hospitable (not that they wouldn't be when busy as well, but it made our time there very special). Some of our favorite staff? David, the conceirge, bartenders Chucho (Jesus) and Box (Victor) as well and servers Geovany and Baldemaro and everyone else who made our stay so special. A taxi to Playa was $140 pesos one way. We went in twice, but did rent a car for the day to go to Tulum (and the hotel staff took care of this for us and the rental company picked us up to go into Playa to go the car, which was nice). Upon arrival, we took the ADO bus from Cancun Airport to Playa for $106 pesos and then a taxi to Petit Lafitte for $140. It was easy! And we were two women traveling solo upon arrival (and not together upon arrival). Very safe and not much Spanish required... We were happy to chill at the hotel and beach most days, but I might consider renting a car next time. Between the transfer from the airport to the hotel, and from the hotel to Playa or other destinations, it might be worthwhile. Then again, who wants to drive home from Playa after a couple of margaritas?!! Petit Lafitte is truly a special place, one I'm glad to have experienced. WE LOVED IT. This is a simple, rustic, yet elegant place on a great, quiet stretch of beach just north of Playa del Carmen. This is not your typical resort that caters to Americans looking for an all-inclusive resort on the Riveria Maya. It has a Mexican feel and vibe to it, and that's why it was so special to me and my college buddy travel companion. It was really perfect. The road in from the main highway is in pretty bad shape. We called it the Beirut road for fun. If possible, take the road leading in to the Hotel Princess and the follow signs from there. Great place for couples. And my friend and I thought it would be particularly fun for an adult group of friends looking to have a great time for a special celebration, or just a good time. Get a bungalow if you can -- they are private and right on the sand, if not ocean front. Easily accomodate 2 adults, could manage 3-5 in a stretch (there is a loft double in most but I'm not sure how comfy it would be to be honest). This place is so great I'm reluctant to tell others in the event it's \"discovered\" and too difficult to book in the future! SHHH.

There are approximately 15 bungalows and 30 hotel rooms. We must have seen 20 guests our entire stay. Yes the rooms are basic, but they are very clean and the A/C works great. Here is a summary of a how we spent a typical day here: Sleep in a little ( hey we're on vacation!) because breakfast is served till I think 10 or 1030. Eat breakfast. Hang out at the beach all day, reading, swimming, sunning and napping. Eat lunch on the outdoor deck-they have the best ceviche!!! Take an afternoon siesta to soak up some cool A/C in the room. Have a before dinner drink. Eat dinner. Have more drinks; by the way the bar is next to the beach under a big palapa. You can have some drinks while listening to the waves and watching the moon reflect on the ocean. Repeat day 2 through 7. We did take a taxi for 12.00 US into Playa one night for drinks, and although it was fun, we really enjoyed unplugging back at Petit Lafitte.

OK let me list the highlights 1- The service was very friendly and very knowledgeable of what to do and where to go in Playa. They all are always very helpful and everybody makes sure you are doing ok and have a good time while you are there. 2- The rooms are very nice and comfortable, always very very clean, right next to the beach (I noticed that in the other hotels you have to walk quite a distance from you room to the shore line, and are also more expensive) 3- The Location is perfect. Not too close and not too far from Playa del Carmen, the perfect distance. When you first get there, the road is a bit bumpy and is not very sophisticated, but when you get to the hotel and get settled and look around then you realize what a great place it is. You have two options, you can take a taxi or you can rent a car. Renting a car is easy and if you do it online with Alamo or Hertz is cheaper 4- I was very impressed and very happy with the food. Their cuisine was amazing. I was there for 10 days and they never repeated the same dish twice, they always had something different to offer for dinner. The quality and presentation of the food was excellent. AGAIN, I was VERY HAPPY with their food, their breakfast, lunch and dinner are fantastic! 5- After dinner I could stay at the pool late at night listening to the ocean or by the bar having a drink, by the way the bar that provides a great variety of fresh food and drinks of all kind all day 6- In general the atmosphere of the hotel is perfect and you feel like family I am definitely going back and I have been telling my friends to go there if they are looking for a place to relax close to Playa del Carmen", "Date": "August 23, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "new york", "Title": "\u201cSuper clean, friendly, and absolutely fantastic food, drinks, and beach!!!\u201d", "Author": "jamericangirlnewyork", "ReviewID": "UR75049049", "Content": "This was our first time staying at this quaint little gem.

If you are looking for a more genuine Mexican owned resort, then you should consider what is offered at Petit Lafitte. The low key/high alpha wave vibe of the old Capitan Lafitte survives here. For over 30 years, the owners, management and staff have successfully created a business model that emphasizes a relaxed, family oriented environment, personal service and great food. Each time my wife (sometimes family members) return it is like reuniting with old friends. Sometimes surprise reunions occur with returning guests such as us. There are no excessive surroundings of glass, chrome and marble here. The facilities express more stucco, limestone and wood with tile and palapa style roofs. Numerous hammocks are slung between coconut trees and a hammock palapa is situated closer to the water. The grounds of Petit Lafitte provide lush vegetation and is well maintained. My wife and I actually saw staff sifting the sand in the cabana area to eliminate any small stones or shells. Perfect for the barefoot experience! Thank you Lafitte. A small zoo is maintained to the rear of the property with an aviary, as well as having havelina, deer, and ostriches. The resort has one nice pool that is approximately 4 feet deep and is cleaned on a daily basis. Petit Lafitte is divided into 2 sections. There is the hotel section and the cabana section. In the hotel section rooms may be considered somewhat Spartan, but spacious and clean with a large shower. Included are a TV, telephone, iron/ironing board, hair dryer, safe and a mini fridge. The cabana area consists of beach front, ocean view and garden view cabanas. The cabanas vary in terms of having king, or two double beds. All cabanas also have a loft bed over the bathroom. The cabanas all contain the same as the hotel rooms except for telephone and TV. All rooms have A/C and ceiling fans. The restaurant is a treat. Two full meals (breakfast and dinner) are included in your daily rate. Breakfast is a menu choice of various offerings. Very good. Dinner is a choice of two specials for the evening, but a menu choice is an option if necessary. We never found the dinner menu necessary however. The meals are 3 to 4 courses and we found all to be delicious. Here is a tip. Whenever asked for salad or soup, always ask for soup, or both. Every type of soup made was fantastic. Waiters, Manuel and Martine are top notch and have a great sense of humor. Oh yes, a good wine selection exists here too. Also, our daughter-in-law is vegetarian, and all accommodations were made for her dietary requirements. A lunch grill is located at the pool/beach bar with a menu of affordable offerings. The pool/beach bar is manned by Jesus and Victor \u2013 known on You-Tube as 2 of the best bartenders in Mexico! That they are. Both grow their own mint for the Mojitos that they make. As opposed to many all-inclusive mega resorts, top brands of alcohol may be found here. I would describe the beach as being of two parts. The part in front of the hotel section is nice, but has exposed limestone bedrock off shore and can be rocky. It does serve as a good area for close-in snorkeling however. To the north end of the property is a gentle sloping beach with easy access to a swimming area. New access from hwy. 307 now exists via the main entrance of the Grand Maya Princess resort that is adjacent to the Lafitte beach. Despite the size of this resort, it still offers many of same amenities found in larger resorts such as spa services, laundry service, tours, internet access, private transfers, snorkel trips, dive trips and fishing. When entering the lobby Felipe is there to check you in and answer questions. David serves as Concierge and will assist in making any special arrangements for your room or for tours \u2013 almost anything really. Ivan, the manager always inquires about your level of comfort or satisfaction.

The staff were very helpful and knew every guest by first name. They worked tirelessly throughout our stay to make us feel wanted and comfortable, but not hassled. The food was excellent and there was plenty of variety. The drinks were well priced too. We stayed in one of the Ocean View Bungalows and although not very well lit, they were clean and very comfortable, bigger than a standard hotel room. I do agree with other reviewers - the fact the hotel is a little remote, you would be wise to hire a car, should you wish to go to Playa del Carmen or to an already booked tour. That said, the taxi service from the hotel is about $30 return into town so not bad. I have one negative comment here and that is one that is not really the hotel's fault.

Now that is quite a statement and requires some reasons to back it up. Some of which would be Petit Lafitte being a tremendous value, especially in comparison to the large all inclusives along the beach, to both the north and south. And that their chef is superb and could work anywhere. And the myriad of excursions and adventures available from the concierge, David (which is pronounced Da-vid, as in Officer David from NCIS). And the tremendous customer loyalty, many of whom have been returning for ten and twenty years. But there are other vacations that can claim the same. I believe that the two unique aspects that set Petit Lafitte apart are their ability to promote the fine art of doing absolutely nothing and their sense that you are family. It has been thirty years since I had 24 hours out of 24 to do just as I liked. Petit Lafitte gave that back to me. Within two days my watch had run down and I had stopped wearing sandals. I'd spend all afternoon swinging in the hammock, wondering whether the Chilean Chardonnay or that soft little Italian Pinot Grigio would go best with the shrimp in garlic sauce that we were having for dinner that night. Or if I should be dramatic and have that complex Argentinean Malbec with the beef medallions. Petit Lafitte is a stress free sanctuary and my blood pressure dropped 20 points in a week. The other unique aspect is the feeling of family. They will know your name long before you remember theirs. The service is exemplary but what sets La Petit Lafitte apart from all others is the sense that they are not providing a service to a hotel resident but hospitality to an honored guest and friend.

It was such a great experience we will certainly return. This resort is small and very safe. We felt comfortable letting the kids run around the resort while we sat on the beach or at the bar. Our kids are 6, 9 and 11. We stayed in the bungalows. It literally took us 20 seconds to walk from our bungalow to the beach. There is a snorkeling outfit right at the resort and they pick you up on the beach and take you out snorkeling. It was only US$25 for an hour of snorkeling. We saw lots of great fish, a squid, a ray and a sea turtle. The beach is very clean and there is an area for swimming. There are some rocks out front, too, but it didn't prevent us from swimming. There was always a beach chair available. The pool was also very clean and well maintained. There is also a small game room with a pool table and ping-pong table. The kids loved that. You can get massages on the beach. There is Internet available on computers in the lobby. We rented two bungalows; one for the kids and one for the parents. We felt very safe doing so. The bungalows are right next to one another. They were very clean but not very luxurious. It's a bungalow, not a luxury hotel room. But it suited our needs very well and was very roomy. The \"loft\" was very small and only accessible by a ladder, but my oldest loved it. I cannot say enough about the fantastic food! We had the half meal plan, which was breakfast and dinner. It allowed us to be out and about during the day and not feel like we were paying for lunch twice. You get a lot of food, a good variety, and lots of authentic Mexican and Mayan fare. Fresh fruit, eggs, pancakes, french toast, cereal, etc. for breakfast. The dinners were gourmet and varied from fish to Italian dishes! These are sit-down dinners, not buffet (although we did have a Mexican buffet one night, but not your typical mega-resort buffet.) Drinks are extra, but very well made and very reasonably priced (they make a mean Margarita - no skimping on tequila!) We rented a car in Playa with the staff's help and also took the airport van recommended on the La Fitte website. We had no problems with either service. The car rental was inexpensive, even with the full insurance. It was about US$60/day. Much cheaper than the airport. Yes, the Hertz office has the stereotypical \"manana\" (tomorrow) attitude, but that is to be expected in Mexico. It didn't put a crimp in our plans. Just give yourself enough time to fill out paperwork. We did the car rental on the second day we were in Playa and had no plans that day, so it worked out just fine. Mainly, it is the staff that made this the most enjoyable vacation we've ever taken. They are so friendly and polite! We truly made friends with the staff. I can't say enough about how wonderful they all are. We will come back as often as possible!

I\u2019ll begin by noting that there are many strong aspects to this hotel. It\u2019s easy to get to. (Forty-five minute taxi ride from the Cancun airport). The hotel\u2019s grounds are beautiful, and its proximity to the beach is awesome. Nice sand, swimmable water. The landscape was really stunning, and because the hotel was not crowded (this was early March), it was easy to find a chair and umbrella, which is key. The price of the hotel room includes breakfast and dinner. The food was consistently good, and the options were healthy. With this said, we had to constantly worry about having our stuff stolen. When we were initially shown our hotel room, the host said that the safe in our room was broken, but that he\u2019d come back in the morning to fix it. He didn\u2019t come back, but this was not a big deal. We just carried our money, passports, I-Pods, etc., out to the beach with us. Sort of a drag, but we thought that this was only temporary. After the hotel staff cleaned our room, we returned our stuff to our room, thinking that no one else would have reason to be in our room. We went back to the pool. Two hours later, my wife noticed that $80 was missing from our wallets. Fortunately, no credit cards or passports were stolen. However, since nothing else was displaced in the room, and the door was securely locked both when we left and returned, this was obviously an inside job. The staff set us up. What sucks is that we were being extremely careful, and we would have put everything in the safe if it had not been \u201cbroken.\u201d When we addressed the issue with the front desk, we were told that the manager was not present. The assistant manager upgraded our room to a different location on the premises, but the upgrade only meant that we had a king bed (instead of two beds, which we had not requested) and that we were about one hundred yards closer to the beach. (And actually, this was a drawback, since the new room was right across from the outdoor bar, where guests partied into the night). Plus, we did not want the upgrade. We wanted our cash. There were other problems. One day we did not have hot water. There was no explanation for this, and there was no attempt to accommodate us. Also, the wireless internet was inexplicably down for the last two days of our stay. Again, this is not normally a big deal. We were on vacation. However, we were counting on just briefly using the web to access our travel arrangements, which were in flux. So, if you stay here, beware. Further, the hotel decided to spray for mosquitoes on our final night. We were warned, and we\u2019d rather not have mosquitoes around than get bit up. (Which we actually did, anyway). But being confined to our hotel room was just another irritation when compiled with all of the aforementioned issues. Take all of this for what it\u2019s worth. My wife and I are very laid back travelers, and we realize that not everything around the world is exactly as it would be in the United States. I also realize that if I had been more demanding or insistent, maybe the outcomes to these various situations would have been different. But who wants to go on vacation to argue and haggle? Also, who wants to have to constantly worry about having their laptop stolen? If the price of the hotel rooms had been less than $130 or $140, fine, I would recognize that there would be more issues to think about.

It is great to have your own little beach home away from home. I can not say enough about how great the staff treats their guests. I really have never met a more friendly happy group of people. The food was great, even for a picky fish eating vegetarian... I would recommend that the chef is made aware of any eating restrictions before hand as well as on a daily basis. There was one dinner where I was not able to get a vegetarian option but there are 3 courses offered so I was able to have a salad and dessert. I loved this place and I felt that often we had the place to ourselves. There were several days where we were the only ones on the beach. I would recommend renting a car to get around.

This hotel offers exceptional service and value for the money. After ten years in this part of Mexico, we feel confident in saying that the service at Lafitte is extremely generous and consistent. From the waiters to David the concierge to Philippe and Luis, and of course Jesus, it's hard to find fault with the staff's patience or warmth. The food is well beyond what it should be for a hotel that is merely average and a very inexpensive price point. That's another plus. But--and it's an emphatic but--the week we were there, the entire hotel was turned upside down by the behaviour of the owners and their friends, who allowed their insanely out-of-control children ruin the stay of everyone who has the misfortune of staying there during those four or five days. It became a joke amongst us guests about how a hotel can have such fantastic service only to have it ruined by owners too selfish to consider that their paying customers aren't interested in staying in an out-of-control daycare. While the owners and their friends fetted each other, the kids screamed and ranted and kicked room doors, bounced balls against walls and generally did what kids do when their parents leave them with a young babysitter for rafts of time. Promptly at 6:15am, the kids would wake up and start running by the pool screaming and yelling. It was truly astounding--the epitome of selfishness and outright obliviousness. That aside, this hotel has a real charm that has people returning again and again, and it's understandable why. It's generally peaceful and small scale, away from the craziness of Playa but close enough to enjoy it. This hotel is nothing special, but it's proof of how good service, kind and good humoured, can overcome an average place. Like others who stayed there when we did, I salute the staff but have nothing but anger towards the selfishness of the owners who seem to care little about their customers when it really counts. Would I stay there again? Probably not, but don't let that stop you. It's a gem. One complaint, which the staff knows irritated me as I told them about it: cabs take far too long to get to go anywhere. 20-30 minutes when there are dozens of cabs in a line at the resort next store and could be at Lafitte in a minute.

Like all the reviews mentionned, the staff is truely the best thing about this resort. They manage to remember who you are, they get interested in you, they always make sure everything is alright without being annoying. The food is impressively good! You can choose among 10 or 12 breakfast choices always served with fruits, juice and bread. You can get a quick lunch at the bar if you're at the hotel during noon time. Finally, suppers are amazingly good. There's always 2 choices and we appreciated that since I don't eat fish and my girlfriend is crazy about it. So everyone was happy, everytime! Once again, the staff is always close if you need anything and they always take the time to help you order in Spanish, which was quite a challenge for me! The beach is amazing, seriously! There's never more than like 10 people at the same time on the beach (I guess in high season that is different but still..) and it's pretty quiet even with the big resorts around. We are a young couple (mid 20's) and we wanted to avoid big, loud resorts. We ended finding exactly what we wanted! I feel not a lot of young people are visiting Petit Lafitte so don't go there if you want to party!

At that time, the original Capitan Lafitte was still an unknown gem of a hotel, tucked away on a 2 km dirt road and not part of any of the copious all inclusive-monstocities that were featured in the holiday brochures in Canada. We were hooked on our second visit when we arrived at the hotel and the reception, dining and bar staff remembered us by our names. We returned this January for our third visit to the now \"Petit Lafitte\" for another week of sun, smiles, sand and surf. We were greeted by the staff with warmth and hugs, many of them having been with the hotel for ten or more years. Despite the encroaching resorts that continue to spring up on an annual basis on either side of the hotel, Petit Lafitte manages to maintain an aura of peacefulness and tranquility within the surrounding developments. As always, reception staff are helpful in suggesting and arranging excursions if one so chooses, and there are no high pressure sales pitch to take part in activities or tours outside the hotel. Many guests arrive with a rental car and take in local sights during the day, so the resort is often quiet and low key during the daylight hours. We love the lack of animators and loud music on the beach. Playa's shopping / nightlife and various other tourist destinations are close at hand and can be capitalized on with little or no advance planning. For those who choose to remain on the beach, reading is a popular pasttime, and there is a well stocked library on the second floor above reception that previous guests have added to. A pool table and ping pong table are also present there for evening games. The food remains, as always, excellent and the presentation of the meals is exquisite, worthy of photos for the main entrees. Unlike some of the buffets at all-inclusives that we have stayed at in the past, you don't leave the table feeling overstuffed and bloated. Staff in the dining room are accomodating in making allowances for special diet requests. The replication of Capitan Lafitte's bar has been a success, with Victor and Jesus carrying on the traditions of various local drink specialties, most notably, the lime margarita. These are, without a doubt, the best on the planet and many, many of the friends we have had accompany us have agreed with this wholeheartedly. The beach remains pristine, clean, and allows easy access into the water (no rocks). Our oceanview cabana provided us with ample space and a great verandah to lounge on during the early a.m. or twilight hours while watching the waves roll in. A few of our past travelling companions have preferred staying in the main hotel rooms, as they are brighter, have tvs and air conditioning, and allow easier access to the dining hall and bar.

This place was highly recommended to us by a friend who used to go to the old Capitan Lafitte. Such a recommendation created high expectations...but these were quickly exceeded by our own experience. What a place this is! First, the location. We stayed in one of the 14 bungalows. These are simple and cozy bungalows with comfortable beds and everything else you need - no TV or phone, which helps you leave any stress behind. Step out of your room and enter paradise. A beautifully maintained garden with bananas, coconut trees, and hammocks will lead you to the beach. A clean stretch of white sand with crystal water. Second, the service. Let me say that by the second day, the staff knew the names of everyone in my family. Not only were they helpful, attentive, and professional, but they were genuinely warm and did everything they could to make sure our stay was the best. It felt as if we were guests at their own house - a close friend's house. They playfully teased my kids about their Spanish, cut coconuts from the trees so they could drink the juice, and got out of their way to accommodate their food habits. I had never been to a hotel with staff as warm, pleasant, and attentive as David and his staff at Petit Lafitte. And, now, the food. I would say that Gaspar (the main chef) could be hired by any high-end restaurant in New York or San Francisco. From pozole to lime soup to grilled fish, every dish was delicious and beautifully prepared, with his own touch. In addition to its flavor, the food was plentiful and every meal combined fresh vegetables, fruits, meat, and fish. The ceviche at the bar was out of this world.

We were there with some of the old-guard who had been coming for years as well as some younger newcomers over the weekend. I won't bore everyone with a long review so I'll just stick to the highlights: -The last stretch of road was nuts but it got us there. We used the hotel recommend transfer service. -Very friendly staff, plus neither of us knew a lick of Spanish; not a problem. -We stayed in a beach-front cabana, which was sparse but the view and convenience more than made up for it. AC was great. They even fixed a broken shower-head without us having to ask. -Breakfast and dinner were good, but we were not blown away. Keep in mind we are from New Orleans and are used to really excellent food. The lunches were awesome (I recommend the shrimp/fish tacos plus the white sauce for the nachos was made out of crack. I mean it was seriously delicious). -Great bar. The bar is also the focal point of the resort, I kinda wish they had made it a bit bigger but Jesus and the other guys do a great job. All I drank were margaritas the whole week and never got sick of them. Really good and I'm not even a tequila drinker. The nightlife is basically the bar - most guests hit the hay before 10. -Good housekeeping as well. Nobody knocking on the door at 9 AM (we are late-risers) to clean the room, due to the size of the resort they just know when you are away and pop in to clean the room up. It's nice not to walk into a sandy room after a day at the beach. -Great beach. Yes it's rocky right out front but that just means a better view from the beach. This is not a real swimming beach, nor can you snorkel right off of it as I mistakenly assumed. It's more of a dip in to cool off kind of thing. You are a ways away from any of the mega resorts. I had to smile when I walked by some of those resorts and saw everyone packed into the beach like sardines. At Petit you have the beach pretty much to yourself. -There was always a masseuse available during the day. Mind you it was just a massage table under a hutch on the beach but it was still relaxing. -There were a few cons: - the zoo looked pretty pathetic but was under construction. I don't think they were really advertising it until it's finished though. -The water sports shack that was onsite only opened for one day for some reason. I got the feeling that it was just operated by someone else who would come when they wanted. I would have liked to rent some snorkel gear just to play with but could not. -Tips. I still couldn't figure it out but I didn't really ask either. I basically billed the lunches to the room and put a tip on the check. At the bar I never signed anything until I checked out and just put a big tip in the box on the bar before I left. I just had to assume that it was split evenly. -Kids may have a tough time here keeping entertained. While they are more than welcome, there just isn't a lot to do besides relax. -PDC was a longer trip than I had thought, though I had a cab driver that took a pretty nutty route into town. I went there for a scuba dive trip but in retrospect I would have just scheduled that through the resort as I think they pick you up right on the beach. FYI - yes you can walk back to Petit from PDC along the beach but it's about 6 miles and 1.5 hours. Yes, I did it. Well if you read this long here's your reward: http://goo.gl/9qv9 That link will point you to a download for a 360 degree panorama that I took from in front of our cabana. When I say were were on the beach, we were seriously on the beach. (it's a .exe file but it won't install anything - I promise. It's just a self-contained 360 degree file that doesn't need anything else to open. Be sure to maximize the window for the best effect as the images are high resolution). Here's a kmz location file also for those of you who have Google Earth installed: http://goo.gl/rAem That's basically where the resort is located, though there's a lot more construction since those satellite photos were taken. In a nutshell it was a great trip. It's really what you make of it. You can do as little or as much as you like, just call the hotel and plan ahead if you want to do anything else other than eating, drinking and reading (my wife finished 4 books - she was in heaven). Low-key resort with great staff and never more than 20-25 guests. Plenty of room on the beach for everyone. Other guests were very nice and we always managed to strike up a good conversation.

Let me first say that if you are looking for the big resort atmosphere with lots of people, amenities and activities, this is not the place for you. But if you want a relaxing vacation with a beautiful beach and a highly attentive and personal staff. This is the place to be. My girlfriend and I were a bit apprehensive on the drive into this resort, the road to say the least is an adventure. But, if you can put that aside, Petit Lafitte is a great place to go! We were greeted by our first names from the moment we arrived. The staff takes great pride in their personal service, and rightly so. Everything was explained about how the resort operates and we were assured that if we needed anything all we had to do was ask. This could not be more true! We chose to stay in a oceanview bungalow. Our first night was in Bungalow #13. All of them are set up the same (some have doubles some have kings), its just the distance from the beach and view that varies. We asked if their were any bungalows a little closer to the beach available and were told that currently none were but as soon as one was, we could move no problem. The next morning #4 was made available and true to their word we were able to move with no hassles. As I said earlier this is not a mega resort, or even semi-mega, the rooms are a bit spartan, but clean and comfortable with great A/C. The beds were a bit stiff for our taste but they added extra padding the moment we mentioned this. We ended up really liking these bungalows and in the future will look for more of the same, IF we decide to go anywhere else. We wanted to take a look at the hotel rooms, but never did unfortunately because we were to busy enjoying paradise! On to the staff, our first night at the bar we were warmly greeted by the General Manager Ivan and his wife Lordes. I can't say enough how much we enjoyed their conversation and hospitality. Rounds were bought and we had a great night drinking tequila (maybe a little too much tequila, right Lordes?) and learning the fascinating history of the Lafitte Resort. Jesus the bartender along with David, Luis, Ricardo, Eduardo and all the great staff there made us feel like long time guests and friends. Please forgive us if we forgot any names or misspelled them. Every single one of you should be proud of your fine resort. The food was really good, we enjoyed the different selections and they would accommodate you if possible for any needs you may have. The service was on the spot and you were never left waiting with an empty glass or plate. Even lunch at the bar was enjoyable. Very fairly priced and again outstanding service. I fancy myself a bit of a tequila snob, and they had the good and premium brands available, again very fairly priced. The beach..... The main reason we love Mexico besides the great people. Unbelievably beautiful!!!! Directly in front of the resort is a reef, but 20 paces to the north is a wide open sandy part for great swimming and or snorkeling. I have researched long and hard trying to find the perfect combination of all the qualities I think make a great beach. Access, swimmability, colors, sand and cleanliness to name a few. So far, this stretch of beach is tops on my list. I have been to quite a few beaches from Cancun all the way down through the Riviera and PDC to Tulum, so I have a bunch of different beaches to compare with. The colors of the Caribbean Sea just blow me away every time I see them. You are able to swim quite far out without the fear of being run over by a boat or Waverunner. And the snorkeling was really nice with the reef having so much to offer with different fish and sea life. We just loved every second of it! They have a water activities desk behind the bar for any excursion you may want, as well as a desk up front for other tourist activities. All you have to do is ask and they will bend over backwards to try and accommodate your needs. Also, instead of setting up a shuttle through one of the other companies, contact the resort directly and make arrangements through them. We went through Olympus, and while they did get us there and back, we spent about 45 minutes at the airport waiting to go and had to stop at another resort on the way there. That is over an hour more we could have sat on the beach. Time is precious, especially when its just a short trip like we had. They also were late picking us up on Sunday, but we still made it to the airport with some time to spare. Next time we will set it up through the resort and avoid those inconveniences.

The food was incredible ! Our package provided for both breakfast and dinner, both of which were 5 star quality. The dinners were three course meals complete with salad, soup, and choice of entrees. No bland buffets! The service was outstanding and the pool was great for the kids. Everything was so accessible. There were only about 30 rooms and 15 bungalows. Not many families were there during August. There was a small flea market on the beach next door to the hotel that had some good buys ! The hotel also had a dive shop that would arrange for snorkeling trips. My only complaint was that the beds in the rooms were a bit hard. Access to the hotel is confusing so try not to go at night and make sure you get directions from the hotel. There is a temporary detour set up to access the hotel and although the route is well marked, you go down dirt roads and through parking lots of other condominiums. It seems like you are going on a treasure hunt. Supposedly a new road will be available at the end of the year.

My Significant Other and I spent a glorious week at Petit Lafitte over New Year's 2009. I have been meaning to write this review for six months! We loved everything about it - its charm, its peaceful setting, friendly staff and wonderful meals. And the bartenders make great drinks! Europeans seem to love this hotel because it's not the big American timeshare property where you need to board a shuttle to get around. It's small and quaint, a little gem right on the beach. If you're looking for total relaxation on a gorgeous beach where you don't have to go anywhere if you don't want to, then this is the place for you. Breakfast and dinner are included so you literally can go from your room or bungalow to the lovely dining palapa, enjoy your meal and head to the pool or the beach. There are plenty of lounge chairs both at the pool and on the beach - or nestle into one of the hammocks on the beach and listen to the soft waves of the beautiful turquoise blue Caribbean Sea. We spent a very fun New Year's Eve at the hotel's little beach bar celebrating with new friends we met at the hotel. The city of Playa del Carmen is about a $15 cab ride from the hotel if you want shopping and some action and you can visit Tulum and the other historic spots easily, but once there, we didn't want to move! We did cab it to Playa del Carmen one day and that was enough. Back to our wonderful bungalow on the beach. I loved stepping into the sand from our bungalow and was glad there was no phone or TV, but if you have to have TV, I understand the hotel rooms are equipped.

My boyfriend and I are both 30. We were seeking a relaxing getaway but still wanted to be close to the mix. Or so we thought. After only two days we grew tired of the beach club music, agreed we could care less about the bar scene on 5th and realized we really came to escape, unwind and recharge. Sooo\u2026 we packed up the rental car and headed a little north (outside of Playa) for Petite, with hopes of a truly relaxing experience. WOW! Petite was exactly what we were looking for!! No crowds, a beautiful quiet beach, and a caring and professional staff that learned our names within hours. Most of the staff has worked with each other and at the hotel for 20+ years. They surprised us with their pure hospitality, attention to detail, and genuine friendship. The property is not super fancy, trendy or chic but very comfortable and clean. There is a classic quality about it that feels like home or your favorite relative\u2019s place. We felt 100% comfortable there. All the other guests we met were repeat clientele and had been coming for 15+ years. Don\u2019t get the wrong idea\u2026 it\u2019s not the bed & breakfast type place where you feel obligated to speak to others. But if you feel like it, you can meet some chilled out and interesting people. The whole experience was just really laid back and casual. Admittedly, the road was difficult to find from Hwy 307... (TIP: turn at the Azul Fives sign). But once on the road leading to the hotel there are signs showing the way. The road is a mess due to the construction of condos, etc. Just sit tight and keep going! We stayed in an ocean front bungalow which I highly recommend. That, or, an ocean view bungalow. The bungalows are really the way to go!! They are rustic (think small cabin) but clean and new \u2013 recently built in November 2008. You can\u2019t beat stepping off your front porch and into warm sand! There is free WiFi, AC, mini fridge, iron & board, coffee maker, safe, a large supply of bottled water, desk and chair, king bed, and areas to store your clothing. There\u2019s also a loft with a double bed. The bed was comfortable...after long days of doing nothing, we slept great. There is no alarm clock so we brought our own, which did the trick. No TV either (but again, free WiFi). The meals were very good. The presentation of each plate was simple and pretty. Produce and fish were local and fresh. Breakfast and Dinner were included. Lunch and drinks not included but reasonable and tasty. Overall, we had a 100%, 5 star experience, and can\u2019t wait to go back and be \u201crepeat\u201d guests. If you\u2019re looking for a party or nightlife scene, or consider yourself high maintenance, Petite Lafitte is not for you. But if you\u2019re looking to remember\u2026 or need a reminder\u2026 how beautiful life really is\u2026 and are content with turquoise waters, white sand, a good book, naps under the palapas or catching a breeze in the hammock\u2026 then enjoy!

Our experience completely surpassed what we had expected based on the reviews on this site. First, I will address the only two potential \u201ccons\u201d people may see in staying here. One, there is no technology in the bungalows. If you absolutely need a TV, phone, etc., you will be unhappy. There is a computer in the lobby that has Internet access, though, so you won\u2019t be entirely disconnected. Two, this place is remote and very quiet. Frankly, my husband and I found this to be a plus. The place was practically deserted other than the guests and staff, and it is far off the beaten path. We never had to fight for service or beach space, and there were very few people or things going on. Again, if you need entertainment to be provided for you by a mega-resort, Petit Lafitte is not for you. But we were happy to sit on the beach, read books, hang out together, swim, eat, and drink. The bungalows are beautiful and so well worth the cost. I found the beds to be very comfortable, the space large and clean, and the view spectacular. In under a minute\u2019s walk, you\u2019re on the beach. The beach was amazing. While there weren\u2019t always enough palapas for us, there were plenty of palm trees or hammocks for shade. The water directly in front of the beach was a bit rocky, but a 30-second walk in either direction promised clear, rock-free swimming. The bar does not have waiters directly bringing drinks to the beach, but it is only a few hundred feet away from the farthest chairs. The food included was excellent. We were worried about not having enough to eat, but we ended up with WAY too much food. The breakfast buffet was perfect every morning, but you can always order off the menu if you want something more. Dinners were outstanding. There were two options every night, and we were never disappointed. I\u2019m a vegetarian who only eats fish, and when I informed the head chef, Martin, he was happy to accommodate and made me delicious alternatives on nights that only offered meat. The bar also served lunch every day (extra, but very cheap). We did this a few times, and it was again very good. Perhaps the best part of staying at Petit Lafitte was the service. Yes, it is remote, and the road there is scary. We had the private airport transfer (worth every penny), but were then concerned about leaving and not finding our way back. There was no need to worry; when we wanted to go into Playa del Carmen for a few hours, Felipe at the front desk got us a cab for $10 that the resort knows well. The driver, Eddie, arranged a time and place to pick us up and he promptly returned us safely. The highlight of our trip off-site was a private trip to Chichen Itza and various other Mayan sites with Cesar, another taxi driver that Felipe set us up with. Cesar took us everywhere we wanted to go and brought us to see things we never would have imagined seeing or planning for ourselves. Everyone affiliated with the resort went the extra mile to make our visit perfect and hassle free. This resort experience was phenomenal. If you want a vacation where you\u2019ll meet tons of people, party all night, have loud bands or performances, and go back to the TV every night, then you will not be happy at the Petit Lafitte. However, if you are like me and my husband, you will love the beautiful atmosphere, the amazing service, and the quality time just relaxing in paradise. P.S.

I am floored that so many people find it to be the hotel of their dreams! My husband and I were really caught off guard by how simple, and rustic the resort was. If you're looking for a tiny resort where you can befriend the staff and want to do NOTHING but read books (bring LOTS) - this is the spot for you. If you want ANY amenities or ANY luxuries...find another hotel. We stayed in Bungalow #1 (Ocean Front) - presumably the nicest room at the hotel. PROS: You can see the ocean from the bed, which is phenomenal. It was convenient to grab drinks at the bar and take them back to the Bungalow. Front porch was a wonderful place to sit and read. CONS: The bungalow backs up to the pool (noisy) and the side of the bungalow lines the pool public bathrooms (can't keep the side window open). They are very dark inside. We had animal friends in our cabin just about every night (including a scorpion). The bed was hard. Porch furniture was old and plastic. No tv, no clock, no phone...right - no room service, no calls to the front desk, etc. - NO conveniences/luxuries! Beach. PROS: QUIET! Private. No peddlers. Plenty of lounge chairs and shade available. CONS: Cannot swim directly in front of hotel. Chairs are old and weathered. No beach waiters. Staff. PROS: They are friendly and get to know your name/room number. Caesar - the recommended cab driver (took us to town and on a full day trip all over) is fantastic! CONS: They certainly didn't go out of their way to make the experience special \u2013 they just did their jobs\u2026which is fine, but not extraordinary. Food. PROS: the salsa/garlic sauce served at lunch is phenomenal! CONS: For dinner \u2013 there are TWO entry choices. One salad choice, one soup, two dessert choices. And, the food is adequate \u2013 truly nothing special. General Overview. PROS: The resort is generally quiet. The beach is soft. I loved sitting on my front porch, watching the waves, reading and drinking coffee or wine. We stayed in a Beach Front Bungalow for 6 nights and spent $2200 \u2013 definitely a good price. CONS: You can\u2019t flush ANY toilet paper in the toilet (think about this\u2026). There are lots of bugs/critters in the cabins. The staff was friendly, but not overly accommodating.

Here are some tips based off of some of the other peoples complaints. 1. Print off the detailed map and directions to the hotel from the hotel's website. Then you won't get lost. Simple enough, I can't imagine showing up to the cancun airport and expecting the taxi driver to know where your hotel is in Playa....these people obviously have never traveled before. 2.Stay in the bungalows....#1,2,3,4, 9,10,11,12....these are the closest to the beach and still get the breezes.... 3. When you tip at the meals leave it on the table...not in the Box. When you eat breakfast make sure to ask for the menu (this is included) not just the continental breakfast. 4. The beach...just to the left of the front beach is a non rocky area to walk out....get a couple of cheapy childs innertubes and take to ride the waves...you can spend the whole day doing that. 5. The staff love to know your names and will remember you favorite drinks/meals/ etc...introduce yourself, because unlike other resorts you will have the same people everyday....most of these guys have worked for the same place for the last 22 years....jesus at the bar being one of them. 6.

You don't need to get up at dawn to claim a beach chair. There is no loud music or swim-up bars or a jacuzzi you can't use because it is full of kids. Just a simple pool, a quiet stretch of beach, swaying hammocks, a charming restaurant, excellent service and the best mojitos you will ever enjoy (at only $5 USD a pop!). We stayed in bungalow #2, with our daughter sleeping in the loft. Note: the ladder up to the loft is 7 feet of a straight vertical climb, so whoever sleeps up there needs to be able to negotiate that. We told our daughter not to climb down to use the bathroom in the dark without waking us first to assist, and she is pretty nimble. Also, there is very little headroom in the loft. The bathroom is a little cramped. We found the bed to be perfectly comfy. The place is so friendly and small-scale that we were comfortable with letting our daughter have the run of the place without direct supervision (unless swimming, of course), which made her feel very independent. There were mosquitos each evening for an hour or two, so bring bug spray. We tipped after each breakfast and dinner using the tip box. I recommend taking the hotel transport to and from the airport. Day trips: We rented a car for $60 USD from the hotel and drove to Tulum & Xel Ha, splitting the day. The road is pretty bad, but an adventure. You don't want to drive it at night. It will take about 90 mins to do Tulum. I wish we had spent more time at Xel-Ha, which had excellent snorkeling and food -- well worth the price. Note: gas is expensive. We used a quarter tank and it was $25 USD to re-fill. Another day, we took a taxi to Xcaret. The aquarium there with sea-turtles and rays was impressive. The night-time show was excellent. The food was regrettable, snorkeling nonexistent (unless you pay extra) and the \"river\" crowded and uninteresting (don't rent the snorkel equipment for this -- there is nothing to see).

Although, the road to the hotel is rugged and under contruction and many taxi drivers had difficulty following the signs, but it's worth it once you get to the hotel. The service is very friendly and several employees spoke english rather well and I have taken spanish class for 4 years in school so I was able to communicate with the partially bilingual waiters. We stayed in a bungalow, which I highly recommend. There was a king bed for my parents and a loft bed above the bathroom for me. When we first got there, small droppings were on my bed, but they graciously changed the sheets for us when we asked. There is no tv or clock radio in the room, which turned out to be a nice escape from the over-technologized lives we tend to live. There is a mini fridge, stocked with drinks and candy, and a small safe to keep belongings. The beach is only a short walk in the sand from the bungalow. Most of the ground in the complex is sand, but we recommend wearing shoes at least half of the time, to avoid getting blisters. The breakfast offers a wide variety of options. We brought a container of oats because we like oatmeal for breakfast and the chefs cooked us some every morning. The fruit is great too! Lunch is available at the bar, however we only ate there once, and it was also great. Dinners are mainly buffet-style, sometimes the entree is brought to your table. Again, food is great! In the main building, there is one computer available to check your email and such and upstairs there's a room with a tv (all channels in spanish), pool table, ping-pong table, and a large selection of books you can read. My mom and I had a deep tissue massage and it was very good, and only $60 for 1 hour. The beach is not crowded at all and you can walk along it for miles. The people overall are very respectful and not the rowdy bunch you'd typically find at the larger, fancy resorts. I highly recommend visiting their zoo, there are many native birds, deer, wild pigs, capybaras, and ostriches.

Upon reading the comments about this hotel, I was excited that maybe there was someplace left where we could hang out, read a few paperbacks on the beach and enjoy quiet evenings in the company of similar minded folks. I read every review on this hotel and they all paint a similar picture - one that is very accurate. So, in spite of the desire to wax poetically about watching the full moon rise over the palms adjacent to the beach bar, sipping the drink of choice and enjoying conversation with some wonderful people, I\u2019ll say this: make sure that you are the right type of person for this hotel. If you need to be entertained, you\u2019ll make a bad choice coming here. If you want a loud and raucous crowd, forget it. If you\u2019re looking for a long buffet line with unlimited choices, this will disappoint. On the other hand, if you are happy waking in the morning to the sounds of the birds and waves spilling onto the nearby beach and having a quiet breakfast under the open-air dining area, you\u2019ll be OK. If you can find peace in a lounge chair on a wide white sand beach with a good book or a walk along the beach, this place will provide the setting. If you\u2019d like one of your most difficult decisions of the day to be whether you\u2019ll order a beer and ceviche or a margarita and beef taco for lunch, this will be your daily challenge.

The hotel is in a lovely quiet location north of Playa del Carmen. Our 15 year old son and his friend stayed in the hotel part and my husband and I stayed in a bungalow on the beach. After reading some of the recent reviews I booked two excursions for our first days because I was worried that the boys would be bored. By the third day, my family was begging me to just hang out in the hotel. The generous & kind staff catered to the boys, and got them fresh coconuts daily and made them special frozen drinks. The beach is spectacular and there are hammocks and palm trees to lay in while enjoying the ocean breeze. If you are reading this review then there will be no excuse to complain about the road in further reviews!! Yes, it is a hell of a road, bumpy, twisty and hard to follow. BUT if you simply hire the car company on the Petite Lafitte website you will be fine. No headaches for us. Once we knew the road, we used regular taxis and could tell the drivers where to go. We really enjoyed the meals. Breakfast was simple with fruit, rolls and coffee but you could also order eggs, pancakes off the menu for a reasonable price. The staff posted the dinner menu each morning which offered two entrees, soup, salad and dessert. Everything was really tasty. The margaritas were also great. We had lunch at the hotel two times and that was really yummy, especially the steak tacos. Petit Lafitte is not a fancy place (we didn't ever wear shoes) and there is little to do accept enjoy your family and the wonderful location. When I walked passed the all inclusive Princess Hotel up the beach with the hundreds of sunbathers drinking the free beer at 10 in the morning, I realized why I loved the quiet Petit Lafitte and I couldn't wait to get back to my little hammock under the palm tree.

Our poor flustered taxi driver from Cancun had to stop four times to ask for directions. The best advice I can offer is to turn by the Coca-Cola (from Cancun)/Crystal (from Playa) sign then TRY to follow the signs to the resort. We had read here that it was a bad, windy road, but I cannot begin to describe to you how crazy it really is. Rooms: We stayed in Cabin #1 which has, arguably, the best view of the beach. We felt lucky to get it, and enjoyed sitting out on our little porch and looking at the ocean, but we found these rooms to be too rustic for our tastes. No TV, no phone, no clock. During our 3-day stay the internet was down, so no computer either. The beds are rock hard and our sheets were well worn. There are a couple of uncomfortable chairs and a few lights, but they are very dim. It felt like camping. Expensive camping. Food: Breakfast was offered from 7-10: cereal, fruit, pastries; dinner from 7-9: soup, salad, two choices for the main. Everything was decent, but not spectacular. The mains could have been warmer. Service was good, but I didn't find it exceptional. The margaritas, however, are as great as everyone here says they are. Nightlife: Absolutely none. It is sooo quiet. Everyone seems like they are moving in slow motion, and, at least during our visit, they kept to themselves. This is what we thought we wanted; we knew we didn't want an AI party scene. We are in our 40s and were looking for a romantic getaway. When it came right down to it, though, we have to admit we were a bit bored in the evenings. We played ping-pong (their only activity--not even board games) and turned in early. I suppose we could have gone into Playa, but we were so worried about finding our way back in the dark, we didn't try.

It fit very well with what we wanted. Hopefully you will find some of these points helpful as you plan what things are important to you. This hotel is not good if you: -Want a fully all inclusive - includes limted breakfast (good) and dinner (choice of two mains) -Want a larger party place - it only has 30 rooms - there was usually one or two other couples at the bar unless it was right before dinner - but pretty quiet in the evenings and the bar closes at 11 most nights -Need a really nice room. The room was functional and clean, but that is about it. We were only there to change and sleep anyway and for the price ok. If it was to rain all week it may not have been good. -Want any sort of arranged entertainment - none of that (which we liked). Also other than the bar/beach there isn't much to do other than a room with a pool and ping pong table, but we really didn't need anything but the bar/beach. -Want beach/poolside drink service - great bar staff, but you need to walk to the bar and get it (the upside is you are not disturbed - we were NEVER disturbed on the beach really even by people selling things). Also note that the bar is right on the beach so from the farthest point it will still be under a minute (well under) to walk there. -While the beach is great the swimming is questionable due to all of the rocks in the water. There is a spot you can to (to the far left of the beach). this seemed to be the case pretty much everywhere along the beach in either direction for a very long ways. the water was nice - it was very dirty and full of seaweed at other resorts we walked by. -The road in is somewhat rough and unsightly in spots - really not a big deal at all (though I wasn't driving) What you may like about the hotel: -Some of the points above that other people may not like -Overall the staff was very good -The bar service and drinks were good and also reasonably priced -The beach is very nice which was key for us. Great sand. -The breakfast/dinner inclusive plan was good as it allows some freedom to go to town, etc. if you want without worrying about missing out. We found it to be a very good arrangement. The wine list is very short and we like our wine, but found ones that were ok to good for a reasonable price ($20-25). I think you could bring your own if you were so inclined. -No timeshares, nobody on the beach selling you things, very nice. Also low pressure on tipping - we did tip well for the good service, but never felt pressured to do so. -The bar is right on the beach with a great view and the lunches there were very, very good and again fairly reasonable. Great chips/pico and garlic cream sauce - order the extra hot salsa - hot enough so I could only use a very little at a time. -The cold breakfast bar was free and quite good for our four days. The coffee was great - and I usually don't drink coffee. At dinner the mains were a bit hit and miss, but the soups and salads were very good. After the big lunch and soup/salad bar I was ok with the dinners anyway - no real complaints. We were in the rooms in the main complex, but the bungalows are apparently much nicer if you want to stay here with an upgraded room experience.

Also, our experience was colored by the fact that the signage to the hotel is non-existant, or actually misleading. The only sign on the main road does not direct you down the right turn. We spent over two hours, which we had hoped to spend on the beach, driving up and down the road, stopping at every hotel, asking for directions. Each hotel gave us different directions, none of which were correct. We finally were able to reach the hotel by phone and got the secret instructions (Follow signs for Azul Five, turning at the Coca Cola plant). This leads you down pot-hole ridden dirt roads, past industrial waste and construction sites, and ultimately to the hotel. No one was apologetic for the waste of time (either by phone or upon arrival). One staff person said that 60% of their guests are repeat guests so know how to get there. When I asked about the other 40% he just shrugged. Another staff person suggested the lack of signage is intentional to help keep the place secret. Well, it doesn't seem to me like a good way to run a business, when your guests arrive already unhappy with the hotel. Other guests we spoke to, including a couple who had frequented the old Capitan Lafite for over 20 years, had the exact same experience. When your time on vacation is limited, and every hour precious, to spend hours driving up on down the road simply because they don't put signs up, is ridiculous.

They had no idea where it was, and we drove around literally for hours. (Felix was really upset he couldn't find it.) To find it, take the road for \"Azul Fives\" (which I think is a development, not a road or town). There are a couple of Petit Lafitte signs, but in the dark anyway, they don't really look like they point to any roads! You will have to drive over a dirt road (which will be paved soon, I would guess, due to all the development going on there), through a factory or construction site (not sure which), down another dirt road, and there it is! They knew we were coming and kept the kitchen open for us. We had a bungalow (#13), the 5th from the beach. It was clean, has A/C, no TV or phone, has mini fridge and coffee maker (get coffee at restaurant instead). Bed doesn't have a very good matress. Pillows are fluffy, but not dense. There's a loft over the bathroom area, accessed by ladder. Would be good for older kids/teens. Pretty dark in bungalows at night, but reading lights over bed and loft. Bungalow has porch with chairs. Stairs lead right to sand. Hotel is situated between a bunch of crowded MEGA resorts (Yuck.) and some newly built high-end ones. Petit Laffite is on quiet stretch of beach.

American bar food, plus great \"Petit Tacos\", and some fancier stuff. Dinner has buffet with soup/salad/dessert. Two choices for main course. We found the food above average. Soups are very good. Entrees above average. Staff pretty nice. Good mojitos. Nice beer selection. House wine is awful; order by the bottle. Very quiet resort. After dinner (9:30), maybe a few people at bar, but not much going on otherwise. If you want a nightlife, this isn't the resort for you. About half people were retiree Americans. Some middle aged Americans. A couple of families with kids. Can be noisy in bungalow in early morning if you don't have your A/C on. Kids and birds can make quite a racket.

I booked Petit based on the wonderful reviews from my fellow TA travellers, and once again, as always, they were right on the money. Petit Lafitte is truly a gem amidst the super mega-resorts which sadly enough, are starting to bleed their way into the tranquil landscape of Playa del Carmen. We did not want a touristey hotel, but yet still wanted to be close to town and near adventurous excursions. Petit Lafitte was perfect. As travellers warned, getting to Petit was a bit tricky and the access road is absolutely horrendous. You can't imagine a road with worse potholes, bumps and uneven ground. It's unbelievable that this road is permitted to stay so ragged! But at any rate, once you very carefully navigate your way through (hopefully without any flat tires), you emerge upon the very welcoming paradise of Petit Lafitte. As mentioned by other travellers, service was very good. Everyone on staff is very attentive to your needs. They do make a point of remembering every traveller and referring to you by name. Emilce at the front desk was especially accomodating and gave great recommendations for my boyfriend and I regarding local sights; she also helped us book our adventure tour, which we highly enjoyed. The bartenders are great and friendly. Although, be careful with their pranks. I jokingly gave Victor the 3rd degree after he dropped a fake spider on me (little did he know i'm very arachnophobic!). Breakfast and dinner are included in the cost of your stay and for the most part, the food was above average. It was nice to not have to leave the resort to hunt for different places to eat everyday. Make sure to wander through their little 'zoo'....a wonderfully sweet man named George takes care of the animals there. But the entrance to the zoo is not marked well and appears very unassuming, so it's easy to overlook. Ask for George and I'm sure he'll give you a tour, as he did for my boyfriend and I. We enjoyed meeting the many other travellers at LaFitte...the seasoned veterans AND the newcomers. It definitely added to the homey feel of the hotel. As warned, the room beds are VERY hard, oddly enough, and there is no hot tub on site. But those were the only negatives for this hotel. Our room #505 was simple but very clean and we had a great view of the ocean, pool and bar.

Most of the recent reviews are spot on in describing this little hideaway. 1) There is plenty of new construction occuring on the way in to Petit. It is a slightly confusing drive in from the main highway but people along the way will point you in the right direction. Amazing to be driving over another resorts sidewalk, but hey it works. I am confident this is just temporary. My only complaint is that the entrance to Petit is not enviting. It may be due to the surrounding construction but it is rather plain. Maybe a little facelift? 2) Employees are very friendly and accomodating. There is no attitude here. A brief introduction and for the entire stay, these people always acknowledged us by name. To me this is appealing in contrast to the larger resorts. The employees here definately make customer service a priority. 3) Stayed in a bungalow with partial view of the ocean. Very clean, quiet and gave you a cozy relaxed feeling. There is no tv in the bungalow, which we did not mind at all. Mini fridge, hairdryer, coffee maker, and plenty of hot water. A/C also worked very well. 2 Dbl beds with an upper loft single bed. Spacious porch. 4) Beach is wide and spacious. Although people walk past the hotel most of the day, there was never a feeling of intrusion. As stated in other posts, the area directly in front of the hotel is somewhat rocky, but just to the north there is a nice sandy entry point. Beach was free of debris, and there was always enough lounges, palapa's for everyone. Did not observe any people out at dawn \"saving\" chairs for the day. Also, the bar is a very short walk to the beach. 5)Outdoor restaurant which serves full breakfast and dinner had a very nice ambience. Serving times varied enough that there was always plenty of seating, and never crowded. Staff worked both meals which meant a very long day for them. They still smiled. Food is fantastic. Two choices for dinner. Having stayed at large all inclusives in this area, id recommend this place to those who wish a quiet, peaceful few days with pleasant, hard working, friendly staff members who appear to put the customer first. For this trip, this is exactly what we wanted, and it is what we received. This is a small resort, and it does not offer all the gadgets of the large all inclusive resorts.

The sea and beach view from our room was outstanding, our room was always spotlessly clean and very well kept. How they controlled the sand we trailed up and down the stairs I will never know!! ;-) The hotel was very quiet at all times, the beach was beautiful with lots of sun-loungers and soft white sand. The pool was refreshing but never freezing and always very clean. The food in the restaurant was excellent and the staff were happy to recommend places to eat in the somewhat tacky Playa del Carmen when we fancied a change of scenery. The margarita's served at the bar were truly amazing and an absolute must for those old enough to indulge in good alcohol.

There were lots of choices and we found it all to be above-average and plentiful. The staff was helpful when they were asked to be, but otherwise left us alone. The location is gorgeous, although it is hard to find and far from Playa (you have to take a cab). They have a beautiful private beach with plenty of chairs. The pool was clean but on the cool side. The seaside restaurant was open for lunch, snacks and drinks most of the time. There were many families with kids there, a few honeymooners and tons of repeat customers at the hotel.

They greeted us by name each time we met, joked with us (especially our waiter, Manuel), and did their best to make our stay enjoyable. Enrique, the manager (?) and concierge handled every problem (like the luggage lost by the airline) and request (he helped us to book a fishing and snorkling trip) with efficiency and patience. The rest of the staff followed suit. When we left, we felt like we were leaving friends. Only two things would have made our trip more enjoyable; a little more light in our room and a computer which was not monopolized by children, so our adult daughter could complete some necessary business more easily.

Very multicultural cliental. Lots of europeans, americans, etc. Air conditioning was great. Water Pressure, AMAZING. Had a safe, refrigerator, etc. What I didn't like: SO HARD TO FIND. Their road got built on by another resort so it's hard to find, at one point you have to drive on another resort's hotel sidewalk! Make sure you get REALLY precise directions. Service was a little slow. getting our plates taken and water refills took forever. It's a trip into Playa. A cab ride is about 12 bucks each way and no one knows where it is. (Make sure if you ask for location you tell them it is NOT Captain Lafitte, that no longer exists.) Not a place for those who want to be \"in the mix\" everyday. There is only one computer with internet and usually kids are on it playing games or something. They really need an \"adult only\" computer. (I realize people come here to relax and not worry about internet but it's nice for plane information and checking email and weather.) Last day we lost electricity and water for like 3 hours, no big deal but I had to take a last minute shower before heading out for airport. Very HEAVY/HOT comforters.

Due to the staff, great and improved food and continued laid back ambience, our expectations were not only met but exceeded. The Lafitte staff is like family to us and in turn treats us like their family. We cannot say enough about the service rendered from all fronts. The Mayan people are truly the most humble and giving on this Earth and always have a smile, regardless of the cirmcumstances. We found the grounds and Cabanas very new and clean and the prices continue to offer one of the best values around.

It was a good choice. For 3 days we never left the hotel area other than to walk down the beach. The food was delicious (hey, I live in New Orleans and am a foodie-so this says alot). The whole place was clean, slow paced, quiet, with nice guests, and nice, mostly english speaking help. The beach bungalows were rustic but comfortable. They are advertized as beach views but don't expect them to all be facing the beach. Our bungalow was towards the back and did have a view but we couldn't really hear the waves. They are still building their gardenview bungalows, of which a couple of them will still face the beach. When they finish it these new bungalows will face a beautiful garden area with parrots. The beds were a bit on the hard side and we had difficulty figuring out the A/C (no instructions and it was not intuitive). There was plenty of hot water, thick fluffy white towels, beach towels, shampoos, soaps, etc. but no lotion. Our room had no clock, no phone, and no TV so disconnecting from our hectic daily schedule was made easier. There was wi-fi in some places and a computer, with internet, for guests in the game room for those who needed it. But, after a couple of days of decomressing I was actually annoyed to see anyone carrying around a laptop and talking about the stock market news of the day! I highly recommend using Transportadora Velazquez (pdctransfers.com). They were cheap, on time, friendly and already knew the way to this hotel. There is absolutely no way I could have figured out how to get to this location without them (behind another couple of residential areas, over and down a sidewalk for The Tides hotel, down unmarked, single lane, dirt roads...you get the idea.

There was only one single negative issue: getting to the hotel... We rented a car and had a hard time finding it in the beginning and actually making it there. I've seen a lot of bad roads in my days, but this one tops them all and is not for the faint of heart - especially after all the rain they had before we got there. Of course, it's not really the hotel's fault, but rather due to all the construction in the area, and it's supposedly being fixed soon. But once you make it, it soon proves to be well worth the drive. The staff is very friendly and helpful. The bartender makes terrific drinks and the people in the kitchen know what they're doing. The rooms are not luxurious, but are clean and have everything you need, including WiFi and free bottled water. We were lucky that the place was almost empty and we got the best oceanfront room. The food was great and plenty. Again, due to us sharing the hotel with only a few other people, we had our meals under a palapa right on the beach. It doesn't get much better than that. Of course, I'm not sure how things are during busier times. The beach is nice, although there are some rocks as other reviewers have mentioned. However, this is pretty much the same everywhere in the area at the moment. If you want superb beach with NO rocks - take a trip to Tulum. If you want party every night, this not for you (but then you'd be in Cancun anyways). But it's perfect for a few quiet and relaxing days on the beach. You can actually walk to Playa del Carmen on the beach if you want. It's about 1.5 hours each way.

The staff is very friendly (front desk, the cook, the bartender) and the food is amazing. We had both breakfast and dinner included in the rate. For lunch we just ate at the pool bar. The place has everything you need (except maybe shopping - the small shop by the entrance is just for souvenirs). We didn't wonder outside the hotel too much, as it's about 20 minutes from Playa del Carmen in a cab. The only downside - if there is one, is not really hotel related. The access road is a bit bumpy. Luckily, we decide not to rent a car so we experienced that just when arriving and leaving. We arranged our transfers from Cancun with pdc transfers.

As we made the bus trip from Cancun, I was surprised to see the mega all-inclusives sectioned out along the highway with their grand entrances. Many Euros are accustomed to these types of resorts and they appear to be gaining popularity with Americans as well, but we wanted more authenticity, meal flexibility, and less \"packaging\". From the bus station in Playa we grabbed a taxi, but due to construction around the Lafitte it was a bit difficult to get there. Once situated however, we were delighted. Stayed in beach cabana #2 steps from the ocean, read in hammocks, took beach walks...even a long one to town with several swims along the way, snapped photos, and swapped stories over beers with the handful of other guests. The meals were wonderful, with a chef who cares. The food was on par with any of the fine restaurants we went to in town for lunch or the occasional dinner away. The staff was attentive without being bothersome or hurried and most had worked there for years. You felt more like you were being welcomed into a family for a period of time. The desk was also very helpful with arranging a trip to Chitzen Itza or with the handful of taxis to town (15-20 minutes due to traffic). I will return to the Lafitte and just hope that the developers don't totally ruin the surrounding area. Side note, the beach is nice, but to really enter and swim you need to enter about 20 yards up or down the beach. right in front of the Lafitte is a small coral or limestone area covered in a dark weed growth. This subsequently breaks loose and washes ashore. Though this isn't ideal, don't let it sway you, the beach is beautiful.
