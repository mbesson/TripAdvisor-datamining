After our evening flight from Toronto, we grabbed a cab from the airport. I selected this hotel due to its close proximity to the airport knowing we would be arriving into Phoenix at around 1:00am EST. The taxi was about $16.00 dollars to the hotel. It was late and we were tired and a bit little grouchy. Upon arrival at the hotel, the front desk pleasantly greeted us and asked how our flight was. We begrudgingly said so-so. The front desk responded by saying \"Maybe an upgrade to one of our suites would help improve your night.\" This was unexpected and perked us up some. The front desk completed our check-in with fresh baked cookies (which were delicious) and we were off to our room. Hotel The hotel lobby, reception and dining/lounge facilities are inside whereas the rooms face inwards in an octagonal shaped open air lobby with a little palm garden terrace in the centre. There are about 5 or 6 floors as well as a pool. There is a lounge and restaurant and buffet breakfast was included in our stay. The buffet was really good with a broad selection of dishes. Room Description The suite came with a kitchenette, living room, and bedroom with a huge wall unit in the master bedroom and two tvs. Water and coffee are included. The bathroom was very nice as well and everything was extremely clean. The space was also very quiet which is important to me as I'm a light sleeper. Overall the hotel exceeded our expectations and was the perfect place to grab some comfortable shut-eye and breakfast in close proximity to the Phoenix airport before the start of our trip. I would definitely recommend it!", "Date": "April 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Swansea, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cVery happy!\u201d", "Author": "satisfaction2012", "ReviewID": "UR128062027", "Content": "We stayed to 'overnight' to recover from our flight, having just spent 10 hours in a plane from the UK!

Very warm, friendly, prompt and efficient. Shuttle to and from the airport was quick and timely. The hot breakfast bar was included in my room price, and was very good. My only con for this hotel, was that the bathroom was a bit dated and needed some work (loose tiles, some slight peeling of wallpaper in corners). It was scrupulously clean so I didn't consider it a deal breaker, but I did mention to the front desk that the tile work was getting loose and there were some touch ups needed.

For the price we paid for four nights (under $450.00) and the freebies (shuttle, breakfast, cookies and superior customer service) this is an outstanding value. The hotel employees really have no control over facilities that may be a little dated, but they consistently seem to strive to make the best out of what they have. There are also the little \"touches\" like the alstromeria flowers throughtout the hotel, the carnation that came one night with our room service, and the fastest and most efficient maid service we ever encountered. For a free breakfast it was good....the catch phrase being \"free\" and as much as you want both eating in or taking it out. Also, if compared to five star locations (like the caribbean) this is six stars because of employee effort. We sleep on 15 inches of memory foam and water pillows so we do not expect to sleep all that well in a hotel. However, the king size bed mattress here at the doubletree was surprising good. We slept pretty good. We were in the back of the hotel in room 346 so the noise issue was minimum (one of the few times I did not have to use my ear plugs to sleep at a hotel). We also had dinner at the restaurant and it too was well above average....served promptly and hot with a pleasant server. So I would say 4.5 stars rounded up to 5.

Many of Phoenix's (as well as Las Vegas') properties discovered this years ago. DoubleTree must have missed that memo. I went swimming once and no more. The pool was as hot as a Jacuzzi and there was a dirty ring all around the top of the pool, where apparently no one has cleaned in ages! It's not a stain, it rubs off with a bit of scrubbing. The only real problem I had, which I did not discover until I had checked out and reviewed my bill, was with the giftshop. I had forgotten my swim trunks at home and went to the giftshop for the purchase, which was charged to my room. She sold me a pair of WalMart's Faded Glory trunks and I went merrily on my way without reviewing my bill. I was shocked to see that what WalMart sells for $10USD, she sold me for $50USD!

The other reviews that say you don't hear the planes are exactly right. I never heard flights overhead. In fact, during my week stay, with the hotel ranging from 80 to 90% full, I never heard anything in the bedroom of my suite. I want my room very dark at night, and hotel rooms are notoriously light. This hotel was the second best I've ever stayed in for keeping the light leakage out. My room was located near the pool, third floor, with the bedroom facing the outside of the building, and it was quiet, dark and easily temperature controlled at night. Staff was helpful and friendly, facilities were nice--this seems to be primarily a business hotel, but even when it was filled with teens and moms in town for a faith-based women's event, I never heard much noise once I was in the bedroom. Room decor was nothing special, a bit shabby, but the room was functional, everything worked, and the bed and pillows were comfortable. Breakfast seating can be a little slow. The large and varied breakfast buffet is free to guests but they manage the access by checking everyone off by name and room number before they will seat you, so at busy times seating bottlenecks. If you are in a real rush, come early. Also, the coffee was never hot although it was served in thermos carafes at the table. I brought my own from my room or served myself from the self-serve air pumps. I wasn't sure how burdensome it would be getting to WestWorld since it was a 20 minute drive. Most days I was able to go at times to avoid the traffic; one morning I had to drive in the Scottsdale \"traffic jam\", not really too bad. Otherwise, it was very easy and quick access to WestWorld on two freeways. Staying by the airport made flying out early in the morning a breeze. If you're a woman traveling alone, don't be alarmed by the neighborhoods you'll drive through on the way from the airport to the hotel. The area around the hotel is well-developed; it's a business park, nicer, newer, and feels safer than the areas you travel through to get to it. When booking, I was a little concerned that many older hotels in the area have all rooms opening onto an exterior corridor. I prefer having interior access, but had a hard time finding it in the price range I wanted to pay. at the Doubletree, there were many points of access from the parking lot but they all required card keys. Once on the property, I didn't have any worries about safety at the hotel. I'd like to see free wireless in the rooms, but they did have a hotspot by the lounge area with free connectivity.

I got a bad taste from the very beginning when I called the hotel after a late arrival at the airport and asked for the shuttle. The woman on the phone was VERY inpatient while explaining the layout of the Phoenix airport (confusing!, as the hotel's shuttle only picks up on one side despite both sides having signs for hotel shuttles -- not sure why), bossy (for instance, when I tried to explain at the beginning of the call that I'd already gotten my bags, etc., she insisted on following her script) and pretty gruff. I then arrived and there was a long line in the lobby to check-in -- that happens sometimes, but it was frustrating to see only one person working the front desk even as the line continued to build. I ordered a room service dinner. Mediocre. My shrimp caesar salad had TINY little shrimp, clearly frozen, and it took 40 minutes to get delivered. The average level of service continued the next morning. The hotel does not put bills under the door, as the vast majority of Hilton and DoubleTree properties do. Instead, you have to check-out at the desk or leave your e-mail addresses in a drop box on your floor. When I checked-out, I needed the shuttle back to the airport. I was asked to wait for 20 minutes -- the ENTIRE time, the shuttle driver stood at the bell desk and did nothing. (I understand the shuttle runs on a schedule, but in my experience many other properties make an extra run when it's slow. Sort of annoying to just sit there and stare at the driver as he does nothing while you wait. Just as with the night before on the phone, I got the impression that the hotel is very \"by the book\" instead of providing personalized service.) I found the hotel's layout to be odd. It is an all external-hallways property with a very 1970s architectural vibe: heavy on the concrete, earth tones, etc. I just don't find a concrete \"hallway\" with brick walls very appealing. Some of the floors have bridges that connect sections of the hotel while others do not. I didn't necessarily feel unsafe as you do in some external-hallway properties, but the overall feeling was not one of high-quality or luxury. It sort of felt like an old Holiday Inn. The rooms are all suites, which is nice. My room was clean, although the carpet was worn. I also thought the room was dark; this is because the living room window looks right out on the exterior hallway and in order to let in light you had to let the world see into your room as they walk to their rooms, which I don't care to do. I thought the public areas of the hotel looked worn as well -- the restaurant and lobby were utilitarian and the elevators were dirty (fingerprints, etc. all over the glass). The place is also noisy, as everyone's rolling bags make noise on the concrete and the pool is right in the middle of everyone's rooms. A lot of people probably go ga-ga over the free breakfast buffet. I suppose that's a touch not usually included as part of everyone's room rate (although as an elite Hilton HHonors member you are often provided breakfast), but I thought the breakfast was pretty average: a bowl of melon that looked like it came from a can, over-cooked potatoes, rock hard biscuits, etc. Personally, I'd rather pay for a freshly cooked breakfast than go to a mobscene buffet with average food. I imagine a lot of people like this property for the big pool and free breakfast; as a business traveller accustomed to DoubleTree/Hilton properties delivering at a pretty high standard, I didn't think this property lived up to the standard of the brand.

The couch was comfy, the beds even comfier. Closets with plenty of space.

The grounds are absolutely gorgeous. They put a lot of work and effort into making them beautiful and it shows. We had a 1 bedroom suite that was cozy for the 4 of us but we used the microwave and fridge to stock up on non-restaurant non-junk food. The bedroom is large with a very comfortable bed and pillows and our son didn't complain about the pull out sofa bed. There is a very large high definition TV which I think convinced my wife to make us buy HDTV when we get back. The pool is very warm and can be accessed all day in any weather. My son swam there everyday for hours. Most of the time there were no towels at the pool but housekeeping was right around the corner and they would give me some as they were folding them. One bad thing is the carpet in the rooms. Our feet were black after walking on the floors. It is kind of gross. I felt so bad we would wash our feet at night before getting into the white sheets and comforter. It doesn't look dirty but your feet don't lie. The morning breakfast is the bomb. It is a sit down style buffet with many options and new things each day (i.e. biscuts and gravy, crepes, waffles, etc). It does close a little early (9 am) and they don't play around. At 9:02 they are closing up. Try to get there early. Everyone comes at 8:30 and you may have to wait 20+ minutes for a table. Tip not included for cost of breakfast so take a few bucks or you can charge it to your room. Also, they have to-go boxes so you can take some things back to your room for later-just ask a server for a box. Jaymi was an awesome help for us and took very good care of us. Free internet near the restaurant entrance that was handy to have and helpful to be able to print off maps and directions to various ballparks (free printing). Housekeeping for very good and will come clean if you are in your room or not. I never saw them so I don't when they come around. We left at different times each day and when we returned everything was cleaned with new towels (they even folded my sons blankie and pillow and set them on the edge of the bed for him). They told me the Oakland A's were staying there but I never saw one person that resembled a professional athlete or anyone wearing anything that had the A's emblem on it. Go figure. We went to many baseball games and access to/from the hotel is quick and easy. The 202 is right around the corner. I was worried about hearing jet noises because it is close to the airport; no an issue. The planes land east/west and parallel to the hotel so you don't hear their engine noise.

When I called the front desk stating I needed to be taken to the airport and referenced the sign, the employee at the front desk denied it existed. When I reached the lobby the sign had been removed.

As reported in earlier reviews, the suite layout is very similar to Embassy Suites... living area as one enters and the bedroom in the rear with the bathroom in the middle off a small hallway. The upholstery in the living room is very dated... dark and almost dingy looking. However, the beds were very comfortable with numerous feather pillows. Front desk staff is very friendly and greets all staff with warm chocolate chip cookies. However, the restaurant staff needs improvement. Although the free breakfast buffet is excellent, I was never acknowledged by wait staff to ask if I would like coffee... even though the restaurant was only about 1/4 occupied. In fact, the ONLY contact I had at the restaurant was with the hostess who seated me, who never smiled, I noted this on the comment sheet left on the table which also asked for a gratuity -- a pen was included making it easy for the customer to add a $ amount. I added both a comment and a small gratuity because the food was good although the friendliness was NOT. The decor of the public areas - lobby, restaurant, conference rooms are very attractive. On the 2nd Friday night we stayed, we were assigned to a 2nd floor suite in the back by the laundry and overlooking the large and very noisy AC/furnace and utility area. Our entry gate (#5) on the ground level had us walking by the multiple laundry carts which were left very messy and disorganized... a very poor introduction to the hotel guest area. Not only was there no view we could not have seen out because the outside windows were absolutely filthy! Again, the decor in this room was very dated, although the beds were quite comfortable. The AC in this room had some problems and the thermostat was flashing that the battery was low. I was finally able to get the temperature adjusted to a comfortable level. I called the front desk and requested a room change and was told there were no other rooms available... although the parking lot was practically empty at the time we checked in. My reservation request had been made approximately 1 month in advance and I had requested an upper level room (in fact, I have a standardized note on my hotel profile). We are Diamond level Hilton Honors members and are almost always assigned good accommodations. It is my understanding that room assignments are made either the day prior to the reservation or early in the AM of the reservation. If the individual making the room assignments had actually READ the reservation and assigned accordingly, perhaps our suite would have been better. The hair dryer did not work in the morning. However, when I called, a man from maintenance came immediately and got it operating correctly. (I thought housekeeping was supposed to ensure things in the room were operating correctly before they leave the room each day... at least this is what I learned when I took a hotel management courses). Another TA reviewer also noted that the ice and vending machines are on alternate floors. This is accurate, so that on floor #2 one has to go either up or down a level to obtain ice. The hotel has moved their Business Center to just outside the restaurant and bar area and now refer to it as an Internet cafe. There are 4 computer terminals that are easy to use with comfortable seating. Although the paper in the printer had run out, it was easy to locate more paper in the cabinet below and refill the paper tray. The bar tender seems to have the responsibility of checking in with guests using the terminal to see if any help is needed and he did come by to see if we needed assistance. The next time we are in the Phoenix area, we may try the Embassy Suites which is nearby... hopefully, the rooms will be more updated, room assignment requests will be honored and restaurant staff will be more friendly. By the way, the front desk has a preprinted handout that provides specific directions from the hotel to the rental car return at the airport. Be sure and pick this up as getting in and out of the airport from the rental car garages can be very complicated. Signage upon leaving the rental car garage is very poor and construction on the perimeters of the airport is very heavy.", "Date": "November 1, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Minnesota", "Title": "\u201cRooms are a little stale smelling.\u201d", "Author": "Check9", "ReviewID": "UR47053324", "Content": "I stayed one night because the reviews seemed so good and I noticed somewhere that the rooms had be updated in 2006.

The hotel itself is large 4-5 stories high surrounding a central courtyard, with a large swimming pool and sauna and an area with numerous canopied tables and chairs for lounging, although no one could be seen lounging due to the heat. We had a room overlooking the pool, with the bedroom facing 44th Street, but again no street noise or sounds from the pool or street due to the excellent sound insulation. We had a \"standard\" one bedroom suite, with a sink, fridge, work desk, pullout couch and a separate bedroom. A large (46\"?)

Large bathroom with complimentary bath products (that barely fit in my suitcase : ] ).

We usually accessed our room from a rear (all entrances require you use your hotel keycard) parking area, next to the hotel shuttle buses and we always felt safe and secure, day or night. Metrolink and buses stop right close by the hotel, but we opted for a rental car. (how do those Phoenicians stand outside in 112 degree heat?)

It made me feel like they really wanted me to feel at home. Everyone at the front desk treated you like a friend rather than a customer. LOVED THE COOKIES!!!! They are the best and were a welcome treat when we arrived. The hotel restaurant has a smaller menu than some hotels, but the food was very good and not outrageously priced. The only downside to this hotel is that there is nothing much around it, however they do offer shuttle service to the downtown area. Our room was beautiful and very clean. (Important when you have your elderly mom with you!). It has an outside entrance to the rooms as opposed to a inside hall, however I never felt uncomfortable walking to my room. The room had a sitting area and then a separate bedroom and bath. It was nicely set up and allowed each of us to have some space to ourselves in the evening. It was a little cool to take in the pool, but the grounds including the pool were kept very clean and tidy. Breakfast is a large buffett with the usual amenities and was very good. In the morning we took a walk on 44th St and found a large Asian Cultural Center about two blocks away. It has a lovely garden area with ponds that you can walk through and has several restaurants with Asian menus. If you want a real treat, walk through the grocery store and see items not normally found in your garden variety grocery store! Fresh fish,in tanks and on ice, unusual meats and veggies are just a few. I love talapia and this is the first time I actually saw the real thing swimming in a tank! It is very interesting and I learned a lot! Being close to the airport, I was concerned about noise, but although you could faintly hear some of the jets, it was by no means noisy.

The living room also had what appeared a new large flat screen tv. the bedroom had the infamous doubletree bedding (one of the most comfy in the industry) and the small kitchenette would be nice if there for more than one night like myself. I found 2 full size bottles of complimentery water (surprise) which were nice to wash down the warm chocolate chip cookie given at check in. The room was clean, the furniture was in good shape and comfortable. The bathroom was bright, updated, and nice touches like a real bathroom rug (another nice surprise) as opposed to a towel on the floor. Nice shampoos, soaps, and lotions. Also went to the gym which was large, nice, and well equipped. It had a flat screen tv hanging in the corner of the room, but some of the machines also had the individual tv screens and they even provided headphones for personal use in the gym area (yet another nice surprise.) I believe I paid 94.00 for a Saturday Night.

A bit wierd about the breakfast--the host makes you wait for a free table and it was really busy the morning we were there, about 8 am on Dec 26. Lots of people were waiting and the wait did move. The host takes your name. Also, unlike other hotel buffets, a server takes your drink order (and expects a tip via a little form they give you.) The place has an old school feel with its outdoor hallway but this allows the rooms to be very deep/big. Our room had 2 queen beds, and a suite area with a kitchenette (micro, small fridge, coffee maker) and hide-a-bed. 2 TV's! Nice extras in the room like Wolfgang Puck coffees, nice teas and Nutragena toiletries including sunscreen. Windows in the room open to fresh air. Yeah! The rooms have nice updates like the furniture but could use a new bathtub--ours was shallow and old but not gross or anything. Everything was spotless. Big negative: no free internet in the room. The marketing materials say there's internet in the public places but it didn't work for us in the restaurant. We didn't try other spots. It's $10 a day or something. Other hotels seem to include it as a standard these days. The airport shuttle was super easy. We called the hotel upon arrival at the free hotel phones near the luggage pick up. The hotel operator was friendly and efficient -- asking us which terminal and telling us which door to exit (there are many) and said the bus would be there in about 10 minutes, and it was. Downside--the bus will not take you to the car rental building. Everyone on the hotel shuttle needed to get to their car rental the next day and the shuttle driver was polite but said he could not take us there as it wasn't on his route. The car rental centre is away from the airport. Oh well. He dropped us at the airport and we took the airport's shuttle to the car rental centre. We did not explore outside of the hotel. It was xmas eve and everything was closed, except thankfully the restaurant at the hotel. We had an excellent meal of fish, salads, kids had kids meals. All reasonably priced. It's in a hotel zoned area, didn't seem like there were nice places to walk or anything, but it's certainly close to the airport! The fitness room was well equipped with a TV at every bike, and had more decent equipment than most hotels. The pool looked nice but we didn't go in--it wasn't lit up or anything and there was a huge puddle that we'd have to walk thru in order to approach poolside. Maybe it had rained that day.

We'd definitely stay here again.", "Date": "August 15, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Edinburgh Scotland", "Title": "\u201cGreat for overnight stay\u201d", "Author": "honved", "ReviewID": "UR8234728", "Content": "Our family of four stayed at the Doubletree Gateway Center en route from Phoenix airport to upstate Arizona. Arriving early evening, the welcome that we received was excellent with free lemonade and warm cookies. We were given very clear directions to our suite which was ideal for what we needed. The layout of the suites is fine although the living room is a bit smaller than many. The bedroom was very well decorated and of a high standard for accomodation in this price range. Breakfast is included in the price, which with a party of four makes the whole package very good value. We thought this was an ideal introduction to our holiday and would recommend this hotel to anyone on a budget just looking to get their head down before moving on.", "Date": "July 25, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Las Vegas, Nevada - USA", "Title": "\u201cHotel caters to business travelers or couples\u201d", "Author": "VegasBling", "ReviewID": "UR7973111", "Content": "The following is a very detailed review of the Doubletree Guest Suites Gateway-Phoenix Center for those that like to know as much as they can about a hotel they are considering. I travel frequently as a business traveler and with my family. My review will be through the eyes of both. However, the gist of my review is this: the Doubletree definitely caters to solo travelers or couples . . . once a third or fourth guest is introduced, I do believe what the hotel has to offer may be more or less desirable depending on the needs of the family/group. At the time of my writing, this hotel is listed as #9 most popular in Phoenix out of 153 hotels. I do believe that favorable reviews are mostly from business writers or those not needing a room with two beds (I will expound on this subject later). The Doubletree is one of the closest hotels to the Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport. A business traveler would definitely need a vehicle if needing to travel to nearby stores, restaurants or other parts of town. However, the Asian Cultural Center is within 5 minutes walking distance which includes Quizno\u2019s, a Ranch Market, an inexpensive Asian Seafood Buffet, and Golden Buddha Restaurant. The hotel is conveniently located off of the 202 Loop which can reach I-10 and other freeways easily. Doubletree Suites is located in a beautiful business park with ample, mature landscaping. Parking surrounds the property on both sides and the back, and the wrought iron security gates must be opened with a room key. There is onsite security that patrols inside and outside the hotel. In addition, there is business park security that patrols neighboring businesses such as UnitedHealth Group and its parking garage. If traveling south on North 44th Street (opposite direction of airport), the following places can be found within five minutes drive time: Target, Costco, Applebee\u2019s, IHOP, Ross, Fry\u2019s Groceries, Del Taco, Sears, The UPS Store, McDonald\u2019s. At 44th and Indian School Road, there is an Einstein Bagels, Pei Wei, Rubio\u2019s Mexican Food, Subway, and a Starbuck\u2019s. There was a previous posted review on Trip Advisor that the hotel is in a \u201cbad\u201d neighborhood. If traveling east on Van Buren, after 15 minutes, a traveler will end up in downtown Tempe where there are charming shops and many places to eat. However, if traveling west on Van Buren, a motorist will find an economically challenged area. My family and I were assigned Room #556. I was traveling with my husband and father-in-law. We were in town attending a family oriented convention. When booking through the hotel\u2019s reservations, I was informed that the hotel only has 20 rooms with two beds in it \u2013 the majority of the rooms had one King Bed and a sofa sleeper (out of 242 rooms). The hotel was sold out the entire time I was there. There was a light stale smell upon entering the room. I slept on the King Bed and found it to be very comfortable. The sheets are of high quality thread count, and there are ample pillows on the pillow and in the armoire. I also slept on the sofa bed \u2013 it was uncomfortable and a typical night on a sofa bed \u2013 my hip bone was on the middle bar of the sofa bed the entire night, and the mattress was thin. Hotel staff called it a Queen Sofa Sleeper, but it is a double bed sleeper. Though children would probably be comfortable on the sofa sleeper, I do not recommend it for adults. Front desk staff and in-house reservations advised us that a room with two beds is on a first come, first serve basis, and is not guaranteed. Being on a comfortable bed is very important and I felt that a lack of comfortable sleeping areas for everyone in my party was a disappointment. However, for those who are looking for value based lodging, they may be willing to exchange comfort for other amenities. Wireless High Speed Internet Access is available in the room through LodgeNet for $9.99 (24 hour standard access), $11.99 (24 hour Real IP Access), and $39.99 for 5 day Standard Internet. Users with Pre-Paid Access Code through LodgeNet may access the Internet with their prepaid code. However, Hilton HHonors Gold or Diamond members get free Internet access. The code for the Internet changes daily and wireless Internet is charged from 12 p.m. to 12 p.m. the next day. There is a 24 Hour Business Center located near the Concierge\u2019s Desk. Hotel guests may access this area with a room key. Guests may use the computers short term to print airline boarding passes or send faxes. There three computers \u2013 two at a desk and one for guests that stand to use the computer. There is one fax machine and two printers. The hotel rooms face outdoor walkways. There are three sections which rooms are located: 1) courtyard, 2) Pool and Spa Area, and Pavilion Areas with six stories. I noted that in the afternoon, the western sun hits the areas labeled as 08-21 and 48-58. However, the air conditioning in room works well. The Courtyard area appears to be the quietest and easiest to access. The Pool and Spa area can be \u201cloud\u201d when there are people swimming when passing by, though you can faintly hear the loud talking/kids screaming if your television is low. The Pavilion area is an outside permanent tent with mini white tree lights underneath along with ceiling fans. Strangely, at night, there were many maid cleaning carts \u201cparked\u201d near this area. If you are bringing your own bags to the room, it can be a pain in the neck as it can be a distance in walking and trying to use your room keep to keep opening the security gates. However, one can obtain a luggage cart from the Concierge\u2019s Desk. The Fitness Center was temporarily relocated from Room #125 to Room #123 because Room #125 was in the process of being upgraded (at time of writing, June, 2007). The temporary fitness center had a treadmill, an elliptical machine, an ab station, free weights, and other equipment enough to do a nice work out. Staff is very accommodating, efficient, and helpful. During the time of our visit, the hotel was sold out. I had inquired about a rollaway bed. The \u201cCare Line\u201d is the central place that routes your calls to the appropriate area. My call was forwarded to the Front Desk, and staff there advised me that normally they do have rollaway beds for rent but did not have any due to the high demand. We requested extra towels and an extra blanket and staff arrived both times within minutes. The room itself is spacious with very beautiful, quality pecan wood furniture. The walls between rooms are solid, and we could not hear conversations or other televisions from guests on either side of use. The room has a nice sized refrigerator, coffee maker, modern microwave, two televisions, two telephones, two desk areas, an iron, and a hair dryer. The bedroom has its own door. The \u201cliving room\u201d area has the bathroom in its area. This allows for privacy for anyone sleeping in the bedroom in the event there is someone sleeping on the sofa bed in the living room and has to go to the bathroom. Also, even if the television is loud in the living room area, it can barely be heard in the bedroom area, and vice versa. With regard to the bathroom itself, there is no exhaust fan. Even though the walls between hotel rooms appeared to be solid, you could clearly hear others using the bathroom in your own room. The lack of bathroom privacy is the second minus other than the uncomfortable sofa sleeper for guests requiring a second bed. Water pressure is low in the shower and when using the toilet. The toilet also appears to be lower than average. You can also hear water sounds (flushing, toilet use) from other rooms either above or below. I believe that a second towel rack could be useful behind the door and I stated my suggestion on a comment card. There are quality Neutrogena products available. The bottom of the bathtub (permanent non-slip portion) looked unsightly. We were provided a non-slip bath mat. However, the bottom looked either unscrubbed or looked over scrubbed. The television in the bedroom area was snowy with very low volume. We called Building Maintenance who arrived promptly and was exceedingly helpful. Our bathroom sink was draining very slowly, but we did not lodge a request for repair. The room curtains had one set of sheers and one set of black out curtains. The room can be made very dark for sleeping when the light needs to be blocked. Even though the hotel is close to the airport, there was no airplane noise during the day. Interestingly, only after 11 p.m., I could hear airplanes taking off. No one else in my party heard the airplanes after 11 p.m. The full breakfast buffet is complimentary and is a wonderful morning treat served at the onsite restaurant, Belvedere. When you arrive, the hostess will ask you your room number and provide you with a piece of paper that enables guests to place the gratuity on their hotel tab. The buffet includes a fresh fruit mix, cottage cheese, yogurt, prunes, varying baked goods, oatmeal, scrambled eggs, bacon, fried potatoes, link sausage, cold cereal and milk, coffee, orange juice, and apple juice. Though there have been a few negative postings regarding the buffet, I think that it is wonderful for being complimentary and not made to order. There is a wide enough variety for everyone. In closing, solo business travelers will enjoy their stay. Families securing a room at a discounted rate will enjoy the amenities for the price/value. However, families that require a guaranteed second bed and enjoy bathroom privacy may wish to book elsewhere.", "Date": "June 24, 2007"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "DoubleTree Suites by Hilton Phoenix", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g31310-d115482-Reviews-DoubleTree_Suites_by_Hilton_Phoenix-Phoenix_Arizona.html", "Price": "$95 - $183*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">320 North 44th Street</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Phoenix</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">AZ</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">85008</span></span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "115482", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/bf/ff/bfff6159b7a52f39e35a708adb04ecf73large.jpg"}}
