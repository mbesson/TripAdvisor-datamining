Contrary to other reports, we couldn't use the pool at the Hilton next door but it wasn't a problem. The buffet breakfast available was very nice and provided more than enough food.

We stayed in the Galea Apartment and were very pleased with it. Internet service was available and our refridgerator was stocked with yogurt, water, juices and more each morning. An iron, blow drier, satellite tv and plush towels were available and the apartment was perfectly suited to the five of us that stayed there. The views of the Grand Canal were stunning and overall it was a great find. The apartments at the Residenza Grandi Vedute are connected to the Hilton Molino Stuckey Hotel and we were able to use the hotel's pool and stept right out of the apartment and have drinks there too. My only complaint about the apartment is that it was a bit dirty in subtle spots- under the end tables, the vents, window sills, etc. It wasn't noticeable unless you looked closely and overall, Residenza Grandi Vedute was a perfect stay. I hope to visit here again on future visits to Venice and would absolutely recommend it!", "Date": "June 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Zurich, Switzerland", "Title": "\u201cHidden Gem!\u201d", "Author": "ARO_EY", "ReviewID": "UR106399661", "Content": "This place is amazing and a true hidden gem that I'm pretty sure not many people know about yet (given only 13 reviews). I don't have anything but good things to say about it - it's a very spacious apartment (with kitchen & large bathroom & tall ceilings), has a stunning view of Venice (3 windows), offers a free boat shuttle service (5 min to Zattere and 10 minutes to San Marco), and is nestled away from tourists. It has all of the services you'd expect from a large hotel given that a lot of the services are actually shared with the neighbouring Hilton hotel (which is massive!). The Hilton actually have their own private shuttle boats that stop directly outside the hotel door which you can also use for free if you stay at Residenz Grandi Vedute. You feel like you have your own private boat taking you to and from each location. And the service runs every 15-20 minutes from the 2 main locations in Venic which is a major plus and always super convenient. The fridge is stocked every morning with basic breakfast items, there's a coffee machine that uses illy coffee pads, and they've got all the kitchen appliances you need. What a great stay and I'll definitely recommend it to anyone going to Venice.", "Date": "May 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Berkshire", "Title": "\u201cMascareta Apartment (2 people)\u201d", "Author": "Alital62", "ReviewID": "UR66092802", "Content": "This is a great apartment (well appointed, spacious & very comfortable) in an excellent location (away from the hustle & bustle of the centre of Venice) with a free shuttle service to & from St Marks Square and I have no hesitation in recommending it.", "Date": "June 1, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brussels", "Title": "\u201cYou will just adhore\u201d", "Author": "MarioBrussels", "ReviewID": "UR49061797", "Content": "Great flexibility of staff: we arrived to check in at 23:00, and we were very kindly received.

It was perfect in every way !! The beautiful apartment was huge for 2 of us, with a separated bedroom, living room and kitchen. And at a price that was less than almost every B&B in venice itself. The kitchen had everything we needed and was filled with complimentary breakfast foods each day. We had 3 beautiful windows that could be opened wide to overlook Venice across the water. The apartment is in an very beautifully restored old building. Location is quiet, romantic. A stroll along the Guidecca waterfront at any time was lovely. Free shuttle service is now provided to / from St. Mark square (pleasant 15 min. boat trip along the Venice waterfront) and to / from the plaza directly across from the apartments (5 min. boat ride) a couple of times each hour. After long days in crowded Venice, it was great to be able to retreat to a quiet apartment and open the windows wide to a beautiful view just across the water.

I traveled with 2 teenage kids, who loved sleeping in the mezzanine with the big round window. Breakfast provided is of excellent quality if a bit sparse; we used to buy bread the night before to make it more substantial. We hope the apartments will keep their excellent value for money relation even after the opening of the Venice Hilton in the adjacent wing of the old mill - and would return there immediately.", "Date": "May 7, 2007"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Residenza Grandi Vedute", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187870-d610743-Reviews-Residenza_Grandi_Vedute-Venice_Veneto.html", "Price": "$219 - $514*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Fondmenta San Biaggio 812/814</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\">Isola della Giudecca</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">30133</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Venice</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Italy</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "610743", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/fc/32/fc32a937554a23c9792f590f42363a7a2large.jpg"}}
