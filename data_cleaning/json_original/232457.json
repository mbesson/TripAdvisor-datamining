First of all, it is not right in the city center, which becomes boring after 1 day. I've seen many small hotels in the city center that would have made much more comfortable to go back. Second thing, I taught that to be classified as a 3 star hotel you would need an elevator... Rooms are clean, but don't look under your bed. Furniture is old, very very basic and a poor look. The are constructions going on at the hotel, which is not the best thing to find. One of the worst things was breakfast... if you could call it so !!! Poor choice, poor quality and not that clean either. Staff was not nice, not bad either. It took them 2 days to get a second keycard done and on the second day they delivered the wrong towels in the room. I know one should not expect a lot from a 140 euro triple room in amsterdam, but we probably would have found a much nicer place in the city center for the same cost.

I can't recommend the hotel for the following reasons... the first room we stayed in was not clean, walls need to be painted (also true of second room we stayed in), the shower did not work properly, no hand towels during the entire stay, bed linen was clean but old and worn, no lift, breakfast very poor standard and overcrowded seating arrangements, overpriced and not good value for money.

My friends and I have just returned from the Groenhof and I found it to be a very pleasant hotel. My husband and I have been to Amsterdam a number of times before and normally stay in 2 star hotels, as we prefer not to fork out a fortune for somewhere you won't spend much time. The differences between the previous hotels and this one were clear. There were six of us in the group spread over 3 triple rooms. Our room was a good size, with lots of storage space and a really comfy bed (although, as they were 2 singles pushed together, there were some 'falling through the gap' incidents!). Breakfast was great, offering breads, jams, cereals, ham, cheese, eggs, fruit juice and coffee. I've found in 2 stars that they frequently only offer the bread and jam options, so was happy with this. The stairs are steep and, if you're on the 3rd floor, you will receive a workout! The hotel might be slightly far out for some, but it's a nice walk to Leidseplein (approx 10 mins) so we were happy. Very close to Vondelpark, which was a plus. The only negative was that the cleaners obviously objected to cleaning hair from the shower drain but that was really trivial...I think the Americans who've rated it badly need to remember that Europeans rate their facilities differently to America. Compared to 3 star hotels we've been to in New York or Las Vegas, this place isn't in the same league...put in perspective though, it's a nice hotel and not too expensive in comparison to others.", "Date": "November 3, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pennsylvania, USA", "Title": "\u201cVery Disappointed!\u201d", "Author": "swedeheart68", "ReviewID": "UR3942285", "Content": "Our stay at the Groenhof was brief, thankfully, only one night.

Climbing back up with weak legs was just as easy as climbing Everest. We were shorted one pillow, so we called the front desk. \"Sorry, you should have called us earlier, the linen people are gone for the day\" we were told. This was 8pm! We folded up a blanket for a pillow, and about 2 hrs later, the lady came with a pillow from another room. I will say that the pillows were VERY comfy and so were the beds, and the only friendly \"staff member\" I met was the cat from next door who liked to come in the lobby occasionally and receive scratches from the guests.

Again, only 3 nights, be patient. Bathroom facilities? What a joke! The shower stall was a tile lower than the rest of the bathroom and the shower curtain was black with mold! Also, there was no heat in the bathroom. The icing on the cake however was when I opened the wardrobe to hang my coat and the most offensive smell emerged. The extra blanket was just thrown in the top half and I have a suspicion that is where the smell came from. I was not brave enough to have a closer inspection, however. I barely slept awaiting for the morning to leave. We skipped breakfast at the hotel figuring if the rooms were filthy, what was breakfast going to be like?

He insisted that this was the standard for a 3 star hotel in Amsterdam. I told him that this was not the standard for a 3 star hotel for anywhere!
