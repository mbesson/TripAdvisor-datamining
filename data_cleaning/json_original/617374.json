{"Reviews": [{"Content": "No peace here I stayed five nights in this hotel with my wife and parents in law back in 2005. It was quite well located (central-ish) and the services (shop, restaurant) were well up to scratch. The big negative for us was the night club on the third floor, which kicked off every night of the week at 9pm and didn't close till about 2-3am. During this time the whole hotel resounded with disco music and though we were on the ninth floor it was still difficult to sleep (even with earplugs). Apparently the hotel is popular with businessmen, and the management is obviously keen to cater for their needs above everyone else's. The large number of dancing girls we saw entering the hotel every evening on their way to the night club inside may have something to do with its popularity with the businessmen. This hotel is categorically not suitable for families.", "Date": "Jun 22, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR158389231", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "CandidtouristEngland"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g294212-d617374-r17137151-Dongfang_Gongxiao_Hotel-Beijing.html", "HotelID": "617374", "Price": "$91"}}
