The second time I decided to stay there again because it is in a GREAT location... very near Kings Cross so you can catch a number of subways to get you all over the city. This time I thought I was clever and asked to not be put in the basement. Well, that was worse. This room SMELLED.. the whole room.

I asked to be moved but they assured me it was nothing to be worried about and to just leave the window open. Fast forward to coming back to the hotel a few hours later and it still smelled awful. A very heavy mold smell that was overpowering. I also noticed huge mold stains on the walls above the bed. I asked to be moved but they said they were fully booked. I went back to the room and became ill. I checked out first thing in the morning and checked into another hotel. I will never stay there again. To top it off, the room was near the stairwell (there are several in the hotel) and you could hear people stomping up and down all night long. Even for a cheap hotel, it's still not worth it.

The Wardonia is not luxury accommodation, and has to be treated as a highly practical, cost effective way to stay in the King's Cross/St Pancras/Euston area of London. I have been using this hotel in order to easily access the British Library (a 5min walk away) for about three years now and, whilst it has its problems, I always end up going back. I have stayed at rather a lot of budget places in London, and elsewhere, and find them to be depressing, bleak places with cracks, dangerous electrics, threadbare bedding with holes, unusual smells, used prophylactics (yes, once in Dublin), and generally the types of hotels and B&Bs that leave you wanting a shower the second you get home. There are a LOT of places around the Kings's Cross area like that, but the Wardonia does some very simple things that make me go back. The rooms are clean, and the bedding is fresh and not stale at all. The bathroom, whilst very tiny, is clean and has decent hot water pressure. The bed and pillows are comfortable and allow for a good night's sleep. For the location and the quality of the rooms it is reasonably priced. Yes, the reception staff are surly; yes, the rooms are made for Oompa Loompas; yes, the shower overflows soaking the carpet in the room; and yes, you'll have to go and find your own breakfast (a blessing, I feel), but for simple cleanliness and value for money in a good location, it is unbeatable, in my experience.

After reading the hotel's website I knew the rooms were tiny and provided the bare minimum, but it turned out to be worse than I expected. The room was like a spartan cell, with extremely old and dirty carpets and curtains that don't go down well if you suffer allergies. The bathroom was so small that you could barely turn around in it. Every time you shower, the entire bathroom floor gets drenched. The old windows had cracks and gaps to the exterior so I can't imagine what it must be like in winter. The first day, after the room had been minimally cleaned, the rubbish was left behind. I thought it had just been a mistake but the second day the room wasn't even touched. I asked at reception if the rooms were cleaned everyday and the response was just one word - \"usually\". The staff at the hotel are unfriendly and just don't want to be bothered and certainly don't care about any problem you may raise. When you ask if you can leave your luggage somewhere, they tell you to put it in a room down the corridor which is unguarded and where anyone can just walk in and take their time in picking what they want to steal. The staircases are extremely narrow and steep, so if you get a room on the third floor you have to drag your luggae up any way you can. I also noticed that fire doors in the corridors didn't close properly, so I would raise concerns over safety in this place. In conclusion, if you absolutely want to stay in this area of London and are travelling on a very tight budget, I suppose you don't have much of a choice but to stay in a place like this.

I can't help but think that had I not mentioned my very bad asthma, this would not have been possible. We ended up with a twin, that did not smell of damp, and was of a more reasonable state. The walls are paper thin though, and you can hear conversations through the walls. Before booking I would recommend checking that you don't get allocated one of the inhabitable basement rooms.

To get to your room we had to navigate through extremely narrow hallways and stairways. The room itself was extremely tiny, with just enough space for a small 'double' bed (more like a super-single), 2 suitcases and maybe a chihuahua, and that's all.

The sheets were clean, although the bed itself was slanted and did not provide good sleep. Towels changed daily. Window pane and ledges were dirty. In fact, most of the room looked dirty except the bed due to the weird dirty-blue color scheme and the dull yellow lighting. We paid 60 pounds a night and I would recommend travellers to explore other accomodation options instead of Wardonia.

When we checked in we were not given our keys until the owner had contacted the travel agency that our company had booked with just in case we dedided we wanted to stay the night for free, despite the fact that both the travel company and our company had provided him with payment details many times over the previous week. This meant we had to wait in the tiny small reception whilst he confirmed (for the umteenth time) the payment details with both our company and the travel agents. My collegue then had to change rooms as they had allocated her a room that had clearly been slept in and not cleaned with dirty sheets, rubbish and pill boxes on the floor and dirt all over the bathroom. She was then moved to another room that wasnt much better, this had snails and spiders on the wall and plaster was hanging off the wall. I would like to say that my room was better and that she could share with me, but it wasnt. Not only was there not enough room to swing a london alley cat, as soon as the window was shut in the room it smelt worse than a public toilet. The room smelt strongly of urine so bad that it hit the back of your throat when you breathed. Also the \"clean towels\" were grey, and the sheets had holes in them. Unfortunately... as we had just dropped off our cases and dashed out it was almost eleven oclock when we realised how bad the rooms were. You can live with a spider but i have never known a hotel to have snails on the wall or to smell worse than a public toilet. we then had to call to find somewhere else to stay and luckily was rescued by good old travellodge... this was only 5 mins down the road and for the extra ten pounds was far superior! When leaving the friendly receptionist told us we would have to pay for the room as there was nothing wrong with it.

I\u2019ve stayed in 100\u00b4s of hotels and while this one may not have been the worst, certainly it belongs among the five worst. Really, the only redeeming quality about the Wardonia is it\u2019s location in the lively King\u2019s Cross area, which is not nearly enough. You can really tell the bottom of the barrel establishments such as the Wardonia from the more respectable hotels by the attitude of the staff and management towards the guests. The girls at the reception, who were Russian, were helpful enough. The real problem with the place seems to be with the people who run the place, who I think are Irish. The first shock was the smallness of the room. The room was en suite but you could not open the door to the bathroom properly because the bed was in the way. It was just plain cramped, like living in a closet. The second shock was the bathroom itself which was just tiny and when you took a shower the entire bathroom floor would within minutes become flooded because there was no partition separating the shower area from the rest of the bathroom. It also became quite comical that when I stepped in certain parts of the bathroom floor, simultaneously in other parts water would actually squirt up from the space in between the tiles in the floor, since the adhesive had worn off. The floor needed to be repaired, lol. The hotel was also very noisy. If you stay there, (which I hope you have the good sense not to) you\u2019d better pray that the people in the neighbouring rooms choose to sleep at night, because every activity in one room can be heard by the neighbours because of the thin walls. One day I requested a new soap from the person at the reception (one of the people in management, I think) because the one in my room didn\u2019t look fresh (something that I didn\u2019t say to him). \"But you already have a soap, sir.\" He responded, and he proceeded to start an argument over a 3 by 5 centimetre bar of soap. Obviously the old adage: \"the customer is always right,\" meant nothing to him. Eventually, he gave me a new bar of soap and then he came with me into the room, took the old bar of soap from the bathroom and then he stuck it under my nose and said: \"this bar has definitely not been used.\" I would, needless to say, not recommend the Wardonia to any fellow travellers.", "Date": "April 5, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Calgary, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGood for the night\u201d", "Author": "Kilguy", "ReviewID": "UR27311356", "Content": "Okay this is the smallest room I've ever been in and the bathroom is the shower as well.

I reported this to one of the clerks on duty, but it didn't appear that anything was done about it.) But I didn't expect there to be no phone in the room (in case I had to contact the front desk). There was also no shampoo in the bathroom (just two bars of soap) and no kettle for boiling water. (The clerk was, however, nice enough to boil it for me with her own kettle.) There was a TV, which was about the only \"luxury\" in the room. Heat was provided 24 hours a day, which was just as well, since London had been gripped by sub-zero temperatures during my stay there. My bed was good for one person with a nice, big blanket. The room and bathroom were clean, as other guests have commented. The Wardonia is fine for any traveler who plans to spend only one night there and before hopping on a train at nearby King's Cross, St. Pancras, or Euston stations the next day. It is a little less adequate for travelers who plan to stay longer, as I did. The hotel is located on a quiet street that is lined with small hotels, and some of the other hotels provide a complimentary breakfast. I thought I would simply have breakfast at any of the restaurants located on Euston Rd., the main thoroughfare in the neighborhood, but they all served the same greasy slop that one would grow sick of after two tries, and usually at inflated prices.", "Date": "January 8, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "manchester", "Title": "\u201cGood for the price and location\u201d", "Author": "sarahld85", "ReviewID": "UR23276924", "Content": "We booked the Wardonia as somewhere cheap to stop for New Years Eve.

London is an expensive place, so we just wanted a cheap place to stay, but nothing gross & dingy. And that's what we found at the Wardonia Hotel! THE HOTEL: The staff wasn't anything particularly \"awesome\" or \"wow\"ish, but they seemed pleasant enough. We never really heard our next door neighbors, but we did hear people walking around in the room above us. Nothing bad, at all. There is not an elevator at this hotel, that we know of. (-)There is no breakfast available, but there is a small convenient store/post office about a block from the hotel, where we bought fruit and croissants. LOCATION: The hotel is a stone's throw from King's Cross/St. Pancras Station. This means it is very close to the underground and train station where the chunnel arrives/departs . I was told that this area isn't the best neighborhood, but I never really felt threatened or uneasy. The hotel is not \"centrally located,\" but I felt it was near enough to everything we needed to see. Getting to Kensington did take a little while, though. THE ROOM: We were given a small room with a double bed, two towels, and a small TV. The room had a very small bathroom: toilet, sink, shower. We had a very nice, tall, screen-less window, which offered a nice breese when opened. This room might get very hot in the summer, but we were there in September, so it was just fine! There was *just* enough room for the two of us and our two suitcases. This was all we needed, because we were out seeing sights all day, so we were only in our room sleeping at night.

There is are also various number of buses passing the station, so you can get back to the hotel 24/7!! The area is nice in my opinion. I did not feel as unsafe as in loads of other places in London.

Next to that tube station there is a railway station called Pancrass and train takes you from there to the airport of Luton. The entire journey from the hotel to the airport takes you max. 1hour!

Hope you enjoy your stay in London! ROOMS: We had a double ensuite. It was just like they say it is on their webpage. Small! Hardly any space to keep our luggage. But not too small to stay the night at. We are big people (my girlfriend and me are both tall, me being 195cm tall), but we managed to sleep in that bed. Im not saying that it was overly comfy, because of the size of it, but good enough to sleep. Neither of us fell off the bed =) The bed was really new and soft!

There was no hairdryer in the room, but you can get one from the reception and keep it in your room for your entire stay! The shower/toilet was spacious enought to shower comfortably and the water was (believe it or not) HOT and came with some power!! This has never happened to me in London before and I have stayed in a hotel there for five times before this. STAFF: The receptionist (met 3 of them in total) was treating us kindly, not overly service-like, but nicely and affectivly! The reception is open 24/7, so there was always someone to let us in and handing us our room key, so we didnt need to carry it with us in hectic London!!", "Date": "February 25, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cornwall", "Title": "\u201cExcellent!\u201d", "Author": "CanadaUK", "ReviewID": "UR12571960", "Content": "I'd heard great things about this hotel so I thought I'd check it out for myself. My friend and I were spending the weekend in London and Kings Cross is a great central location for us. Great for arriving at London Paddington (various tubes accessible) and departing to Heathrow (direct on Piccadilly line). The outside appearance of the hotel is nice and welcoming. It is quaint, with a small reception area and 24 hour reception. There are no elevators and only narrow stairs in this 3 level building, but that was not an issue for us. The rooms are very small but that was also not an issue for us as we were only sleeping there and didn't require space. The room was impeccably clean, the bed was fantastically comfortable and the shower had lots of pressure and made you not want to get out. We didn't hear any noise during our stay and we were in and out at various times of the day and arriving back late evening/early morning. The only downfall is the shower shares the same floor as the small bathroom so once you have a shower it is tough to get dressed because the floor is soaked, but it is doable. For the cheap price of 55GBP per night for a double bed (no breakfast) it was an amazing deal for London. I will definitely stay again and highly recommend it.", "Date": "January 13, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dallas", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location, Excellent Facilities, Competitive Price and Nice Staff!\u201d", "Author": "Amarone1988", "ReviewID": "UR12465429", "Content": "After having read some of the recent reviews, I almost wonder whether I stayed in the same hotel. I found the staff efficient and polite throughout. The place was spotless. The mattress was really comfortable. The sheets and towels were very well laundered. The multi channel tv worked and the shower and toilet looked brand new, with great water pressure. The location was excellent. What more, could you want ? It is true to say the rooms are compact. They are well designed though and their form follows function. You do not get a suite, bell boys, glass elevators or room service at this hotel. You do not get a restaurant, business centre, swimming pool etc. Which suited me fine as they wernt charging for any of these either. If I was to compare it to a \u00a3300+ a night room Boutique Kensington Hotel, it would come off very badly, being substantially smaller and without the luxuries of room service, mini bars, plasma screens etc but then at a 1/6th of the price, one must make concessions. All in all I would stay there again happily, when my budget dictates. At this price level, clean, safe and functional is all one can expect and it satisfies these criteria and exceeds in some respects.", "Date": "January 9, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bristol, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cSimple and affordable\u201d", "Author": "Nesburrito", "ReviewID": "UR12306241", "Content": "Stayed in this hotel for two nights, single room.

However, when people say this room is small... they mean SMALL! I couldnt believe it, the room was so depressing too, the receptionist seemed annoyed that she had customers, i was seriously annoyed that i had to struggle with a heavy case through narrow corridors and steep stairwells. the bed was nearly the entirety of the room and even it wasnt big enough, for a single person it would be fine but for a 'double'...! you are having a laugh! we both teatered on the edge of the bed, ridiculous. there is a tv and a bedside table. the ensuite is very cramped, not only is it tiny but the door is spring loaded so you have to get hit by the door just to sit on the loo, when you sit on the loo you can rest on the sink!! the shower (particularly stupid) is on the same level as the rest of the bathroom so if you have a shower the whole bathroom gets wet... very safe...

It's important to read on their website, what you shall expect. It's a low budget hotel, so the expectaions shall be reasonalbe. What I found very important is that it is clean, also bathrooms are very well maintained. (Also it's great that each room has its own bathroom). A very big advantage is location - hotel is 1 minute walk from King's Cross underground station. Although it's a busy place, the street with hotel is quiet and safe. I'm a young girl and safety was important for me - I felt really comfortable walking in the late evening back to hotel. Also staff in reception is very friendly and I felt as a welcomed guess. If I shall think of disadvantages, maybe narrow corridors, stairs and very tiny rooms. My room was actually just a bed and space to walk in to bed ;) So if it is just to spend night, then it's ok, otherwise, could be claustrophobic. But there is TV, which can distract you from thinking how tiny it is ;) One more minus is that walls and ceiling are very thin - so you feel having a group of elephants above you, and I was awoken during night by neighbours who were moving out. But in general I recommend and I think I will sleep there next time I'm in London.", "Date": "November 27, 2007"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Wardonia Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g186338-d637234-Reviews-Wardonia_Hotel-London_England.html", "Price": "$79 - $164*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">46-54 Argyle Street</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\">Kings Cross</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">London</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">WC1H 8ER</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">England</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "637234", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/e0/39/e0396d5e5374e8e01024090a6e5f49eb4large.jpg"}}
