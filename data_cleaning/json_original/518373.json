It is close to the subway station and 3 stations away from Atocha where you can take the shuttle to the airport for 2 euros. There are some restaurants in the hotel area, a supermarket across the street and a bakery close to the hotel where you can have breakfast if it is not included. The rooms are clean and the staff is nice. It is a pity that you have to pay for the WiFi in your room. They give you 30 min free WiFi in the lobby.", "Date": "January 11, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Frankfurt, Germany", "Title": "\u201cPretty good\u201d", "Author": "Alexander_Santana", "ReviewID": "UR95044549", "Content": "If you want to find something with good quality. That hotel is for you. Clean room, polite and helpful staff, good breakfast. We passed there 2 nights. The hotel looks like a business hotel. Normal, clean room with a queen size bed (you can move that bed to any place), TV, mini-bar. Bathroom with bidet and bath. For wi-fi you have to pay. For free you can find it yust in the lobby of the hotel. The breakfast its not cheap and does not have hot meals and if you don't have some promotion price may be its better to eat in the nearest cafe. In front of the hotel also you can find a shop. The hotel it is not close to the center but you can reach it using metro (station Puente Vallecas is a nearest one) and using a bus service ( In 8 minutes you will arrive to Atocha Railway Station) .", "Date": "January 31, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kitzb\u00fchel", "Title": "\u201cWorst experience I ever had\u201d", "Author": "Reise107", "ReviewID": "UR89154246", "Content": "I booked 3 nights, no smoking room. unfortunately because of late arrival we got only a smoking room for the first night, it wass probably the worst experience i ever had in any hotel..just on the corridor of the first floor we smelled all the smoke and entered the room: shoked: cold, old smoke was in the room, everything stinking of smoke...furhtermore signs of a shoe soles on the top of the ceiling with bloody remains of mosquitoes on the wall..really lovely for a 3* NH Hotel..i think it was one of the worst rooms they have..next day the changed the room, it was than ok...but for an NH HOTEL really bad.", "Date": "December 6, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "canada", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel - Good access to downtown and subway\u201d", "Author": "tkertise", "ReviewID": "UR67947632", "Content": "First off, this hotel should be rated much higher then it is. My wife and I try to stay in only higher end places and are quite picky. This place isn't bad. It isn't the fanciest or nicest hotel we have ever stayed in, but it is clean, modern, well kept and in a pretty good location. Its about a 2 minute walk to the subway and then a 5 minute ride into the heart of the city. The people at reception speak below average English but were able to help when required.
