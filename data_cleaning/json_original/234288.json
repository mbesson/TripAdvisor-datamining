Overall hotel was small, with basic amenities, limited resources at check-in taking much time to get the proceedings done. The room size was decent with all facilities provided for. It was more of a business hotel than a hotel you would like to choose for a vacation. Bfast Buffet was outsourced to a restaurant at the ground floor of the hotel with a fixed menu.

Relative to other reviews: the hotel seems to have been renovated. The room is pretty basic and functional. Interestingly enough, there was no soap in the bathroom even after complaining (had to use shower gel - maybe that is a cost-saving measure!). The staff gave me a room in which they knew the wireless did not work (I found out from a colleague who complained and moved out of my room!). I also asked for a quiet room, but door slamming started early in the morning.

Service from the one receptionist on check in was poor, I waited 25 minutes whilst the receptionist dealt with 2 people in front of me. The facade is all being redone, so the view from the window is of scaffold and monoflex sheeting. Dust has been allowed to penetrate the rooms and some surfaces near the windows were coated with a thin layer of white. The standard of cleanliness of the rooms is unaceptable, corners have not been vaccumed and stains on the room (and corridor) carpets, the former of which stuck to my feet. The mastic in the bathroom around the bath was yellow/orange instead of white and you can hear all the abolutions of your neighbour because I think that there is no separating wall in the bathroom above the suspended ceiling. The aircon in the room was not aircon it was just a noisy fan pumping out ambient temperature air. Breakfast is in the bar opposite reception, if you can call it breakfast. 70's style decor, fluorescent orange everything with loud music pumping out. Self service (for that read you'll find it in the corner) no orange juice, polite request for same was met with a grunt, run out of cereal, 15ml of milk left in the bottom of the milk jug, ambivalent Goth waitress trying to do 8 things at the same time (dishes, tables, stock up the provisions). Nice area of madrid with plenty to see and do in the evenings but in a city with some really nice places to stay and at reasonable rates this is definitely a place to avoid ~ at all costs.", "Date": "June 23, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Madison, Wisconsin", "Title": "\u201cIt served its purpose.\u201d", "Author": "Strigs8", "ReviewID": "UR24085845", "Content": "Booked this through Priceline.com just for 1 night as we were flying out in the morning through Madrid.

Probably the worst characteristic of the hotel is the location, there is absolutely nothing in the immediate vicinity.
