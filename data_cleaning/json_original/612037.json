If you don't mind paying for a hotel room that you can NOT sleep in...this is the place for you! Arrived to a very hot, pre-paid room...was told that the air-conditioning could not be turned on until June 1st. Asked for a fan, they had none. Opened the ONE (screenless) window in the room, hoping for some cooler evening air. Went to dinner...came back, no luck! We had to leave the window open that night in order to breath. The noisy brick street, busy with it's constant traffic, honking horns, motor scooters, tourist buses, police sirens, and then early morning delivery trucks with their aluminum doors sliding up and slamming down, made it impossible to drift off for any more than a few minutes at a time. Not to mention trying to sleep on now wet sheets from pools of sweat! The next morning we all looked forward to a nice cool shower. We did not however, expect it to come from the wall mounted toilet tank above the commode, which sprayed you with a fine mist every time you flushed! Inside of the actual shower stall, the glass doors were lined with black mildew, and the shower door feel off into your hands every time you tried to open or close it. There were no washcloths, nothing but thin linen towels to dry with, and no mat to step out on. When we went down for breakfast, (which was nice), we shared with the staff how miserable our night had been and asked that something be done about the temperature in our room before we returned that evening. After a long day of sightseeing, we came back to find that our room key didn't work, and we had to wait for a master key to be located to open our door...and...our room was as hot as ever! So, we took things into our own hands and were fortunate enough to find a store where we could purchase a fan. With an hour of cooler night air being pulled in from the outside, we closed the window to reduce the street noise, and did get \"some\" sleep that night with the oscillating fan running back and forth over the 3 of us all night long. The sheets were clean but our son pushed his computer bag under the edge of his bed for the night and the next morning when he pulled it out, it was filthy with dust bunnies the size of Rhode Island attached to it. We left the fan at the hotel, and told the front desk staff to keep it for the next guest. No one should have to pay to endure a miserable night as we did!

The hotel was selected by a friend who was meeting us in Rome and had stayed there for years. Unlike the previous 2 reviewers (who, I believe stayed there awhile ago), we found the hotel to be very nice. Our room for 3 was large and the bathroom could have been a small single unto itself. However, our friends opted for a room with no bath and, were amazed at our room, because theirs was nowhere near as nice. We also found it very quiet as our room was away from the street. (Again, our friends' room was on the street side, and was noisy.) Based on this, we would have rated the hotel higher, but give it a lower rating because of the price. Now, as I said, the reservation was made by a friend, so I did not have the opportunity to price rooms in Rome, but the Stromboli was about $230 per night (no breakfast included in this price). This was for a hotel just a few steps from the train station and a cab ride from the heart of town. And it was certainly no nicer than the other five we stayed at on our trip throughout Italy, all at least $100.00 cheaper per night.", "Date": "June 27, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oakland, CA", "Title": "\u201cServed The Purpose\u201d", "Author": "QlDude", "ReviewID": "UR5361140", "Content": "I stayed in this hotel last summer for one night after arriving on a delayed RyanAir flight at 1:30am. The terravision bus dropped us off at Termini (from Ciampino) and we were looking for the first hotel we could find so that we could get some rest. We immediately saw Stromboli (it is adjacent to Termini) and thankfully they were still open with someone at the desk. The man at reception offered us a discounted room, due to it being so late. I think we paid 80 Euros. We were just happy to have a bed to rest our heads for the night. The room itself was on the smaller side, even for Rome. The bathroom was clean enough, but was definitely old and could use refurbishment. In fact, the whole room could have used a refurbishment, including the beds. Overall, this place was not bad, and it definitely served its purpuse for us. It was quiet, and we got the sleep we desperately needed. We checked out the next morning and found a different hotel for the remainder of our stay. I would not recommend it this hotel for more than 1 night. This is not the type of hotel you want as a base for your Roman holiday. I would recommend it for people who want to be near Termini for early or late departures.", "Date": "June 19, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Stromboli", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187791-d612037-Reviews-Hotel_Stromboli-Rome_Lazio.html", "Price": "$75 - $1,321*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Via Marsala 34</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">00185</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Rome</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Italy</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "612037", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/9c/f7/9cf7f4e770695fb479bdd694c11db7032large.jpg"}}
