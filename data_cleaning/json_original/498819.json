We chose to stay at Palazzo Cardinal due in part to location and due to previous recommendations from friends. The rooms were nice and comfortable although somewhat small by US standards. The rooms were cleaned every day. There was wireless Internet in the rooms which worked well for the few times we made use of it. There was some night time noise, especially if you are like us and prefer to sleep with a window open. We simply dealt with it. The bathrooms were small, but again no big deal. There was breakfast every morning downstairs and we made the most of that. Most evenings we had a pre-dinner drink in the hotel's bar area. The hotel is set up for a light bar service and they can even cook a small dinner for unplanned situations. This worked perfect for us as there was one evening my parents were too tired to go out for dinner. We knew the location was great and this selection alone was important as we were traveling with my parents including my Dad who was wheel chair bound. In the weeks leading up to our trip, the staff was wonderfully responsive and informative in helping to answer questions and helping us to set up tours and plan day trips. During our five night stay we got to know most of the staff personally. Again the staff were very accommodating, especially towards my Dad. By the time we left we felt like we were saying good-bye to friends. For my parents this was their once in a lifetime trip to Rome and to see the Pope. The hotel and the staff did not disappoint. For my wife and I, we will look forward to coming again someday to spend time with our friends at this excellent hotel.", "Date": "April 13, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles", "Title": "\u201cLiterally a block from the Vatican\u201d", "Author": "Beenaround73", "ReviewID": "UR127339186", "Content": "Seldom is the time I give a hotel an Excellent rating, however this place was pretty much as close to perfect as possible. It is on the main axis leading to St. Peter's and literally a block away. The hotel is an old residence of Cardinal Cesi and maintains much of it's old world charm. The nearest train station is Musei Vaticani a little far, but walkable. We got into the main station (Rome Termini) and took a cab to the hotel. The hotel itself is quite exquisite and you get that feeling as soon as you walk through the double doors. Of course, sometimes they're closed so you have to press the button to get in. The first things you see are the cloister corridors, the splash of colors, and the elegant simple courtyard. The lobby is towards the rear of the courtyard. If you are looking around for a traditional large check-in desk with someone standing around, forget it, not at this place. The lobby feels more like a living room, including a nice wood desk which is where you actually check-in. The gentleman who helped us check-in was very kind, personable, and professional. When we were done with the paperwork he showed us up to our room. Even the corridors are elegantly designed. The rooms are simple but elegant at the same time. The room wasn't as big as some other ones we stayed at before, but everything was plush and so clean you could smell it. The bathrooms were also simple and elegant. It seemed like we were the only ones there until we heard a door slam in the morning the next day. There were a couple of things to enjoy while at the hotel. One was enjoying the courtyard on a warm evening (which it was when we were there) and the breakfast room. The room was large but felt very intimate. The food itself was wonderfully delicious and fulfilling. We were lucky to get a very good price on this place and if we get a chance to go back to Rome, this is the first place we will look to stay at.", "Date": "April 6, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cAt the Doorstep of the Vatican\u201d", "Author": "bkb6060", "ReviewID": "UR127223663", "Content": "Talk about location! The Palazzo Cardinal Cesi is located on the Via Conciliazione, literally a few steps from St. Peter's Square. You just can't get any closer to the Vatican than this. If you're interested in photography staying here allows you to photograph St. Peter's any time of the day or night. To get the early morning light on the facade just step out of the door when you wake up and aim your camera. Night time photos of the floodlit Basilica are a snap when all you have to do to after a late night photo session is turn around and walk through the door to your hotel. Proximity to St. Peter's is the major advantage, but it's far from the only positive thing about this location. City buses and the step-on tour buses stop directly across the street from the Palazzo, and a just few steps farther down is a taxi stand, making transportation anywhere in the city extremely easy. A subway stop is fairly close as well. A tobacco shop selling all manner of necessities is right next door. The area is VERY safe, and is peaceful and quiet at night, which can't be said for all areas of Rome. These things make the Palazzo a perfect choice for first timers to Rome, although repeat visitors will find a lot to like as well. The Palazzo Cesi is an oasis in a very bustling city. Walking through the door into the serene cloistered courtyard makes the noise of the city seem a million miles away. This pleasant atmosphere is much appreciated after a tiring day of sightseeing. Although the garden is only open to hotel guests during very limited hours, the tranquility it provides is very welcoming. The building itself is historic, having been built in the year 1400. It's now the headquarters of an order of priests and brothers who share the building with the hotel they operate. Since different wings of the building are reserved for each purpose tourists rarely cross paths with the order. While not luxurious rooms at the Palazzo are immaculately clean and more than adequate in every way. The beds are comfortable. The hallways are quiet, we heard no noise from outside or from other guests. When closed, the window blinds completely darken the rooms. Our family group had two rooms, both of which were a nice size. One of the bathrooms was smaller than the other, however, with a fairly small shower stall. If that matters to you maybe it would be wise to request a room with a larger bathroom. Nice toiletries are provided, and the breakfast was very good. While not what I'd describe as warm the staff was none the less helpful at all times. Because our luggage was lost on the flight they recommended moderately priced clothing stores out of the tourist area so we could replace the lost items without busting our budget. Due to scheduling issues it was necessary for us to change the dates of our reservation after they'd been made. The Palazzo was professional and helpful in dealing with these changes. Email questions were promptly and thoroughly answered. This is a wonderful establishment, and a perfect place to stay in Rome. We'll definitely stay there again.", "Date": "April 4, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "addis ababa", "Title": "\u201cPoor customer service\u201d", "Author": "tskada", "ReviewID": "UR124417211", "Content": "I booked this hotel for my parents when I was living in Rome.

I was very excited to get a room here at a good rate, based upon the reviews. The good: The staff was very nice. Special thanks to Augustino who works the late shift who helped me book a last minute tour to Florence. We requested a corner room on a lower floor, and got both. This was tremendously helpful since I am claustrophobic and would not get on the very small elevator. Also, this corner room had two windows, which made it feel bigger. The bed was also perfect. It is the only real king size bed that I have ever slept in in Europe. And it was comfortable. The location is remarkably good. For us, just about perfect. Being that close to St. Peter\u2019s is really great. One of my biggest concerns was that there might not be any restaurants in the area. There was no need to worry since there are actually many. And they are just a couple of blocks away. The best, by far in my opinion, was Tre Pupazzi, Borgo Pio 183. There is also a very good gelato shop just across the street there. There are five tourist bus stops directly across the street from the hotel. This is great for checking out the town, but definitely not a substitute for getting around town (as I thought) since they do not run frequently enough and are quite slow getting from one side of town to the other. Also, none of the comments I read mentioned the souvenir shops. It was great to have so many souvenir shops right in the immediate area. The Bad: We had room #206. The internet did not work. The light next to the bed did not work. The room was not entirely clean (specifically the toilet seat lid and floor around the toilet). We could find only one English language channel, the BBC. Noise: We had a neighbor who snored every night. It was just loud enough to annoy you. We could hear a conversation \u2013 clearly enough that I could tell it was a British woman. One night, we had a full audio performance of a female during \u201cextracurricular activities\u201d. It actually woke me up. The bathroom was the biggest issue. Having read the reviews, I did not expect a big bathroom, and I knew the shower was small. What I did not realize was just how small the shower was \u2013 until I got there. How small was it? Well, I had to stop the shower and open the sliding doors just to bend over to wash my lower legs. It was tiny. Also, the toilet was so close to the wall that I had to sit at an angle. If you are above average size, or older, you might want to take this into consideration. Overall, if I were returning to Rome, I\u2019m not sure I would stay at this hotel again, mainly because of the bathroom. If not the Vatican area, I would likely stay in the Piazza Navona area, which is fantastic but not as busy or popular as areas like the Spanish Steps. Piazza Navona is actually only about a 15 minute stroll across the bridge. The city itself is very beautiful and very crowded.", "Date": "May 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bamako", "Title": "\u201cPeaceful hotel in fabulous location\u201d", "Author": "Jeliya", "ReviewID": "UR103803248", "Content": "The hotel is the third building down from St. Peter's, on the right. You can't really get much closer than that. It is wonderful to be able to step out the door and into St. Peters Square and the Vatican complex. The real bonus is to do so before breakfast, no wait at security and be in St. Peters at 8 am when it's quiet and there are no tour groups (you might even have the Pieta all to yourself) have the run of the place for a few hours, and still catch breakfast. Even though the street outside can be manic and noisy, once you step through the doors and into the courtyard it is instantly calm and cool. The hotel itself is modest, there are few facilities, it does breakfast and you can have drinks in the courtyard, but then, you have come to Rome so you will spend most of your time out sightseeing, strolling, shopping and going to restaurants. The rooms are modest in size, clean and comfortable, bathroom is small, and that's about it. As long as you know what you are getting, you won't be disappointed. Service is helpful and friendly, and there is a sense of tranquility about the place. Breakfast is buffet, reasonable selection. Some guidebooks suggest that it is a bit out of the way, I didn't think so. Piazza del Popolo, Trevi Fountain, Piazza Navona, Pantheon are all 15-20 minutes walk away, but it helps to study the map and pick which bridge to cross. The walk actually makes it more enjoyable, you pass a lot on the way, especially if you use the smaller streets in the centre rather than main ones with the traffic on them. Bus route 64 links it to Piazza Venezia and Termini Station, so that helps if you want to get to the other side of the city quickly. If you are arriving from Fuimicino Airport, the coach to Termini station stops at Piazza Cavour first, which is less than 10 minutes walk from the hotel (just head for St. Peters). While most of the good places to eat are across the river, there are also good places nearby. Avoid the tourist traps near the Vatican - at all costs, never eat into any place that has a waiter outside hussling business. Two good spots about 4 blocks away are Da Toscano on Via Germanico (good Tuscan food, great steaks, nice setting) and Ragna D'Oro on Via Silla (more local food, informal but pleasant setting).

The hotel is set back in an old palace-style, with an inner courtyard. The outer gate is locked at night, and you need a room key to get in, so it's very secure. The staff were helpful on arrival, and showed me to my room. The room was spacious enough as standard - had a double bed, desk with TV, small wardrobe with safe and a bathroom with shower, toilet/bidet and basin. The room was clean and the amenities were acceptable and provided me with all I could need during my stay. The location, to say the least, was magnificent. Step out the front gate, and 20 steps to your left and you're in St Peter's Square. Also, a 20-minute stroll into the heart of Rome, and 5-10 minute walk to the Ottaviano Metro station, or the St Peter's train station. Plenty of caf\u00e9s and restaurants around. I do, however, have some criticisms of the hotel. The room itself was fine. The bathroom was adequate, however the shower was a bit too small for a man of my size (6ft) and I had trouble in it. Anyone of a smaller stature would have no issue. The shower had a bit of soap scum left on the soap rack, which was a little off-putting. During the first evening, what seemed to be an extraction fan or similar kept clicking on and off at random intervals, and I was unable to find any switch to turn it off in the room. I checked with reception the next morning, and they advised next time it turned itself on, to call down to them and they'd turn it off from their mainframe system. The curtains would not shut properly, so I was unable to completely block out the sun, and had to dash across the room lest I be seen in an immodest state from street-level. The sound of water rushing down the pipes either from others' showers or toilet flushing was rather loud in the room, and occasionally woke me at night.

The tour guide was an american called Steve and so great. we bypassed all the queues and what a tour.!! well worth it. took a few hours and ended in St Peters Church...words cant describe how amazing it is!!...we ate that night in a lovely family run restaurant just past the archway beside the vatican walls called Borgh Bio..just fab and so friendly! a real family run place.!! fab food!...we walked the next day to the Trevi Fountain and Pantheon and Colleseum, walk didnt take long, 20 mins from hotel...busy but great, but glad we stayed near the vatican and not in the centre, so lovely to get back to the vatican at night and relax and unwind and wonder round the square after dinner.

The bed was very comfortable and when we asked for more pillows they arrived promptly. There was ample storage space and electric shutters on the windows afforded privacy. The standards of cleanliness were outstanding, the bed linen and towles were changed daily. Breakfast afforded lots of choice, my partner particularly liked the fact that there was a wide range of teas and pots to brew them in, unlike many continental hotels it was therefore possible to make a decent cup of tea. The hot items were limited to scrambled eggs and pancetta but both were of a good standard.

She was always cheerful and nothing was too much trouble. We used the cafe several times and were never disapointed. Other restaurents were a ten minute walk away as everything close by closed for the evening. Not a problem for those who like an evening stroll. The courtyard belongs to the Savatorian monastry which is why hotel visitors have no access to it, you can however sit and admire it from the cafe, it is especially atmospheric when candlelit in the evening. Location is hard to make a judgement on, for closeness to St Peters and the Vatican then it would be almost impossible to beat, however it is not so convenient for the historic centre. That said buses run from nearby to those areas and anyone who enjoys using Shank's pony would be able to stroll across the river and into the centre without any difficulty.

The world outside the front door was busy touristy Rome, but once you step through the massive front door you step into a calm peaceful environment. The staff was helpful. The breakfast was good. The room was clean. Do not let the prices detour you. I contacted the hotel to see if there was a better price than was being shown on their web page. Since we were staying for several nights the hotel was able to offer us a reasonable price that made it possible for us to stay here. (It never hurts to call/email and ask.) The only negative I have about our stay is that there was significant noise between each room; but I would take the noise to stay here again.", "Date": "October 10, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wexford, Ireland", "Title": "\u201cHard to Beat\u201d", "Author": "ruar", "ReviewID": "UR20191763", "Content": "I booked this 'hotel' instead of where my uncle & aunt were staying on the other side of Castel St. Angelo b/c it was cheaper and in the best area. Don't be scared by the average price shown, I played with dates on their website and a single was as low as 85EUR. (I paid 170EUR) Except for their sister 'hotel', you couldn't find a better Vatican location. It is a very safe area, even for a female alone like me. The very large exterior doors are closed at night but just buzz reception, they'll take a look at you on the small camera and open the automatic doors for you, to get out push the button on the inside. Inside the doors is a beautiful calm oasis. Reception is straight ahead and just to the right (looks like someone's office). There's a small bar area that seems to be quite popular. An elevator past that takes you upstairs or take the marble staircase. Just past the elevator is the breakfast room on the left which looks like monks are expected for a meal, and a small lounge with a computer with internet access. I had a single room which had no room for a crib/cot but was a nice size for just me and baby. There was a safe, fridge w/ honor bar, slippers, remote TV, phone, luggage rack, plug for internet and electric blinds to block out sun. Might have been more things like an iron and bathrobe, but I didn't notice. The double paned windows kept out any noise. The bathroom was a very nice looking marble. On closer inspection it was the fake marble but a very good one. There was a shower and enough space to put toiletries. The room was deliciously chilled when I went into it and I actually turned down the A/C fan. The bed was comfortable but I was tired. Buttons for the lights and to control the blinds and the internet plug are on the headboard. Breakfast was coffee & teas, pastries such as chocolate croissants, ham, cheese and other cold cuts, and probably cereals and juices. I was in a hurry and didn't have time to try everything. They do not discourage children, they have a cot/crib and there was another couple with a small child there. I am not sure it would be good for older children, like my 3 and 6 year old. Noise in the halls would carry and they can't really run around too much. The atmosphere is too quiet and they have the courtyard cordoned off. From what I gathered it is a headquarters of the Salvatorians. Part of the building seems to be used solely for religious purposes. The paper slipped under my door in the morning was not a bill but a list of bible readings for the day. There are materials in the rooms of a religious nature as well. If this bothers you, it might not be the place for you. I think it was recently opened to guests and everything seems new and of good quality.", "Date": "September 19, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta, GA", "Title": "\u201cLoved the Palazzo Cardinal Cesi\u201d", "Author": "Cruisingat60", "ReviewID": "UR17364997", "Content": "In late May, a group of 12 \"old friends\" (we graduated from high school together over 44 years ago!) booked a Princess cruise that left from Civitavecchia on May 26th.

Luckily we found the web site for the Palazzo Cardinal Cesi and they had rooms for all of us! (Only 30 rooms are available as it is still an active monastery). Not only were the rooms quiet, comfortable & fabulous, but the people who work at the hotel are all fantastic! Franz, especially was awesome! Not only did he see to our every need during our stay, but he also helped as our unofficial tour guide booking Vatican tickets and making sure we understood the open air bus routes...plus he located some lost luggage at the airport! Every morning we were treated to a delicious Italian buffet breakfast that was out of this world with variety. Everything about this hotel is 5 star plus!

The courtyard/lobby is the best I have ever experienced but, a common theme with Italy and indeed most European cities, the room was small. Right outside the hotel is are about 6 tour bus stops so take your pick of bus and see the whole of Rome or stroll 100 yards up the road to see the Sistine Chapel, Basilica Church and the museums etc. Our tour cost 130 euros for both of us (pre booked)and even picked us up at the hotel for the 30 second drive to the museum. The bonus of doing it this way is you miss the 4 hour queue and have a guide per about 6 tourists who explains things you may have missed such is the layout and lack of plaques and info etc. They say rome wasn't built in a day but if you exclude the Vatican, it can be toured in a day if you start early enough. We saw all the sights and chose the 15 euro hop on, hop off tour bus deal enabling us to get off and walk to different sights that you can't get to by bus (such as the Spanish Steps and the Pantheon). Beautiful hotel. Our room was a standard as the were no deluxe available. it has 30 rooms and only 4 deluxe. All rooms have a shower only and those wanting a bath in their room has to book at their sister hotel down the road (which is not as nice). All rooms have electric shutters which block out all noise (not much in this part of town anyway) and all light. Our standard was tiny but adequate. It cost 255 euros per night which again, is expensive but worth it to save the commute to get into Rome. There is no parking but they have a deal with an underground garage nearby who allow you to park there at a discounted rate of 20 euros per day. We used it for one day with no problems. The breakfast room is excellent and food was good. The courtyard is available from 1600 to sit and have a drink but again is expensive. My wife seemed a little too comfortable to chill out there sipping her way through vodka and oranges at 7.50 euros a piece. It is an idylic setting in the courtyard. You are metres from the hussle and bustle of Rome yet it is so tranquil. The main door at the front is shared between the hotel, the pilgrimage and some sort of Cardinal's group. There are lots of choirs singing and it is lovely. There are also tombs of ancient priests etc there. I was disappointed not to have got a deluxe room and asked to see one on our last day so I could compare. I must say, it was about 1 metre wider and about 50 euros a night more expensive so definately not worth it. The only real bonus is you don't have a comically small shower room in the deluxe. All in all a lovely hotel in the heart of Rome a literal stones throw from St Peter's Sq. Staff are great and, apart from the usual room size issue, it is faultless. I apologise in advance. I forgot to take pics of the room. close your eyes, picture a double bed and a tiny shower room and you'll be spot on.

Upon check-in we were told that they were giving us a quiet room facing via Santo Spirito (the back side of the hotel) because the rooms are quieter as opposed to facing the front as shown on all the advertisements. Later I found out that all rooms face the back of the back of the hotel and that there are no rooms facing the front. All the rooms at this property are small. We paid for a delux room. We returned around midnight from a late dinner, we discovered the shower would not drain. I called the front desk to advise and they were not receptive to move us to another room. They suggested that we take shorter showers, however the drain was completely plugged. This drain problem should have been discovered when the room was cleaned before we arrived. We really wanted to take a shower and after strongly pressing this issue we were finally given a key to another room to use the shower. You can read other reviews on this site for shower size. The other room was a single but decorated the same as our delux room. The next morning when I returned the key I inquired if there had been previously problems with the plumbing and was advised that the drain stops up when you wash your hair. We had looked in other rooms during our stay and all the rooms look like a delux rooms. Don't pay the extra for a delux room. Upon check-out I brought up the fact that we had problems with our shower and the inconvience that this caused. Having paid for a delux room, I thought a working shower was part of the package. I was sternly advised that I was not going to be charged for using the other room that could not be sold that night because it had to be cleaned after we used the shower. Needless to say this matter could have been handled in a more professional matter, either by price adjustment or a simple apology would have done the trick. This hotel's location to the Vatican would be the top selling point in my opinion. While many hotels in Rome are costly, the price paid for this hotel for what is provided in room type, size and ammenity should be judged with staying at a further location and saving the difference in cab fare or simply walking and enjoying Rome on the way to St. Peter's. REMEMBER YOU WILL NOT HAVE A ROOM FACING THE VATICAN AT THIS HOTEL AS SUGGESTED IN THEIR ADVERTISEMENT.
