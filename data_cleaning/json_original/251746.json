The biggest challenge that we encountered was the fact that the hotel is currently in a state of transition and upgrade. This means that the rooms were very nice and stylish, but the lift didn't work and there were workers pounding away beginning first thing in the morning on the new lobby area. When we checked into the hotel, we were told our room was on the 5th floor, which shouldn't have been a problem...except the elevator wasn't working. So we had to lug our bags all the way up the narrow steps. Fortunately, the receptionist (who was very nice) was able to change our room to the 1st floor for the remainder of the trip to avoid a heart attack going up and down the stairs! Wireless internet was free, but it seemed to come and go throughout the day. Our second room (after the switch to the 1st floor) was right above the street, so there was quite a bit of noise through the drafty windows. But we were so jet lagged, we barely noticed!

So a few thing a very picky person might complain about, well I just chalk it up to staying in a building that is at least 100 years old.

Unfortunately we had transportation problems and had to find alternative transportation from Leicester to London. On the trip down to London we spent 2 hours trying to get through to the hotel to check what the latest time we could check in. Althought we were supposed to have been able to check in from 14:00 no one answered the phone until 17:00. We had chosen the Edward hotel because of its location and the amenities its claimed to offer. Such as en-suite bathroom, Satelite Tv in Room safe etc. We arrived at the hotel at about 23:30, had to wait for about half an hour whilst the night porter dealt with a group of italian tourists. The problem was, the night porter spoke rather broken english and no Italian. The italians meanwhile could also only speak rather broken English. Eventually we got checked in and headed up to our room. Upon arrival we found our room down a small dingy corridor. The room itself wasn't bad, 2 comfortable beds, which we simply pushed together to make a double bed. Its from this point on we had problems. My wife nipped the bathroom and came running back out, as she'd found what looked like a baby cockroach climbing the walls. I took a quick photo of it with my camera phone and then got rid of it. The amenities that the hotel boasts appear to be destinctly lacking - satelitie TV? you get Sky News and CNN and that's only if someone has remembered to turn the channel on downstairs. The in room safe was superbly secure, i couldn't even find it!!!! So there was no way any burgular was going to. The door didn't have any proper locking device, even the door chain was missing. The hotels only plus point was the free WI-FI available, although all the exposed routers on each floor does pang of a rather DIY approach- but as an IT engineer even i had to admit that it worked.

We arrived at the Hotel prior to the 1pm check-in and would have been very happy to leave our luggage somewhere secure while we had a spot of lunch until we could check-in. UNLUCKY for us this was not the case! The receptionist that greated us virtually reduced us to tears! He threw a key at us for a room to place our bags screaming at us that it was not acceptable to arrive earlier than check-in time. I must admit that I did look at him in a manner that he obviously did not approve of but I have to say I was completely dumfounded. He then went on to ask for the key back - said we could \"Do whatever the hell we liked we our bags - but they were not obligated to keep them!\" I pondered the situation for a minute then informed him that we would go for some lunch and come back at check-in time. We went, had lunch and arrived back at 1'o clock. The pleasant receptionist had changed his tune when I asked him to write down the name of the manager - he bribed us with telling us in very poor English that he was giving us the nicest room in the Hotel - it was the suite and cost \u00c2\u00a3150 per night but he would give it to us for two nights at no extra charge! I told him I would not accept such a thing as a apology for his behaviour and he insisted..............WELL..........................if this was the nicest room I would seriously HATE to have been staying in any other room in this Hotel. The carpet was sticky and dirty, their was black mould on the shower curtain, their was cigarettes all over the balcony furniture, other peoples hair in the bath and by 8'o'clock on our first evening we noticed we had no warm water or heat in the radiator! The TV looked like it was borrowed from a museum, most of the lights did not work, the walls needed a good lick of paint. It was bitter cold outside and wasn't much better indoors. We approached the same RECEPTIONIST who told us to let the water run for ten minutes! and give the heat about another half an hour and he would call up.................and he did! With a plug in radiator that was broke on two wheels. We froze in a dingy bedroom for two nights with no warm water and gave up trying to rectify the matter. I suffer from Asthma and left this establishment with a Chest Infection from a cold damp grotty room - I spoke to the Manager upon leaving who offered my \u00c2\u00a320 compensation but no apology! I took that matter one above her and the Group General Manager apologised on behalf of the RECEPTIONIST telling me that the receptionist is used to doing night shift and obvoiusly the daylight had something to do with hs behaviour! And that I should be grateful that he had tried to make amends offering me their suite! AND that I had already paid a really cheap rate for the hotel. (\u00c2\u00a370 PER ROOM PER NIGHT)! The Group Manager of course denied that the heat or the hot water were both on the blink and it's very easy to deny now that we are back in Northern Ireland. He proposes that when we next require accomodation in London if he has suitable accomodation available we can have a room with his compliments.................well over my dead body.
