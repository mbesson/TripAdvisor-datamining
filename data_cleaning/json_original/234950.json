But mostly clean and quiet with good hot water. Breakfast is 7 euros and is decent but you can eat cheaper outside. Conveniently located near the U-bahn in a neighborhood with plenty of food choices. Staff speak good English and are friendly. Biggest issue is someone in an adjacent room was smoking and the whole floor reeked of it.", "Date": "January 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGreat value and service\u201d", "Author": "Julian088", "ReviewID": "UR70969817", "Content": "This is a small friendly family run hotel. The facilities are only 2-3 star but everything is spotlessly clean and the beds are very comfortable. They have good free Wi-Fi. The staff are very friendly and helpful with sufficient English. It is close to a U Bahn - so travel in the City is no problem. You can book a parking space in the courtyard which is very secure.", "Date": "July 15, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Overall": "5.0", "Rooms": "1", "Value": "5", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "East coast", "Title": "\u201cVery cheap and very clean\u201d", "Author": "old_student", "ReviewID": "UR5889572", "Content": "Very cheap, very clean, very friendly staff. Quiet neighborhood, quite close to the city center. If you can't allow yourself investing more than 50 bucks per night for a Berlin hotel, \"Am Hermannplatz\" is your choice. The hotel is basically two floors of a 4-floor building in a residential area, renovated and remodeled for a hotel. The entire staff is one front desk clerk and one custodian. The clerk speaks decent English and he is the one who will bring your breakfast to your room in the morning (they don't have any dining space). All the amenities are _very_ basic (a double bed, a small bathroom with a shower stand, a small TV and a telephone, a closet, a table and two chairs), but it looks like the room has just been repainted and even the sheets look brand new. The hotel is in a short walk distance to the Hermannplatz subway station, from which it's a matter of minutes to get to Unter den Linden and any other location in the city center. The Tegel airport is on the same subway line (U7). Good for single business travellers, students, young couples, and basically for anybody who prefers to save on a hotel. Not good for the one who prefers comport and the view of the Brandenburg Gate from the hotel's window (no, you won't see the gate).", "Date": "September 28, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel am Hermannplatz", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187323-d234950-Reviews-Hotel_am_Hermannplatz-Berlin.html", "Price": "$72 - $122*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Kottbusser Damm 24</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\">Kreuzberg</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">10967</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Berlin</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Germany</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "234950", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/98/c2/98c22ed5ef6e916b20ebfe15d06a84461large.jpg"}}
