Had the double room been less than 50euros we wouldn't have complained. But we paid 180euros for a mini double room that was clearly not looked after, the wallpaper was coming off, the bathroom had dirt in between the tiles. One cheap push-on hand soap. Wireless internet wasn't working properly so useless. It's definitely not worth 3 stars and the most you should pay for a double room is 50euros, don't expect anything nice or welcoming, just a place to sleep one night or too.", "Date": "September 7, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cLoved it\u201d", "Author": "Marjak57", "ReviewID": "UR73625776", "Content": "To find a room in the historic district at this price is great.

The first night went allright except that the breakfast was really not worth mentionning. I was then moved to a different rooom on the second night and this is where the problems began. The room smelled terrible. Also the AC unit was bust and shut down on its own every 10 min. The night shift guy could not speak a word of English and was not at all sympathetic nor helpful. I was told the next day by the manager that the problem was due to excessive heat and had nothing to do with the hotel (\"Excuse me!!?!?!\"), therefore my request for a significant discount was rejected. Well, that was not his exact words. It would be too rude to mention them on this review.

At first I was puzzled, as I\u2019ve expected to see a reception on the entry level. There is one directly after the entrance on the second floor. Once we\u2019ve reached it \u2013 things came back to normal \u2013 the room was clean and visibly new. There was a PC in the room with a hybrid LCD display \u2013 playing the role of a wall-mounted TV and the computer monitor at the same time. For non-techies finding your way through the remove might take a while though. :) The bed was very comfortable; breakfast was delivered in the room every morning on a pre-defined point in time (6:30-9:30). Ask the guy at the reception to set this for you the previous evening. Bathroom was clean and new, although a bit small. The room was nicely decorated (with Michelangelo replica poster) and had a direct view into the ruins located in the middle of piazza Fiume. When closed \u2013 the windows provided perfect isolation from the street noise, generated by the otherwise busy traffic. Transport connectivity is quite good \u2013 there is a Metro stop 10 minutes away and Termini station is only 3 stops of all 6 different busses stopping 50 meters from the building on via Piava. We\u2019ve stayed there for 7 nights and we\u2019ve enjoyed the stay. Something definitely worth mentioning is the exceptionally friendly staff. The guy there was always available to give us advice on where to buy and additional suitcase from, where to have nice dinner in a romantic place at a decent price, what would be the most optimal route to take in order to visit 5 different places the same day, which buses or other transport to take to get to a certain place, where not to shop, what is a reasonable price for the local ceramics, etc. It was exceptionally useful when he called us on the mobile phone roughly 15 minutes after we\u2019ve left, to notify us about the keys and the mobile phone we\u2019ve forgotten on the way home. I rushed back to collect them before going to the airport. There are a number of great restaurants around - one pizzaria directly on the opposite side of the Piave street made the best lasagna we've had there. A small restaurant called \"il Rifugio del Buttero\" provided the best Napoli-style pizzas and other delicious Italian kitchen samples. Of course you can always argue that the breakfast is the same every morning and that there are not gym and swimming pool in place, but practically looking \u2013 all we were looking for was a nice place to spend the nights at, at a decent price and ideally at a walking distance from the center. This is what we\u2019ve got. Augustus met those expectations quite well. It is by far not luxurious, but a very good deal for the money which I can recommend if you\u2019re going to Rome for sightseeing.", "Date": "October 18, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Divonne", "Title": "\u201cenjoyed the welcome\u201d", "Author": "sashazDivonne", "ReviewID": "UR11080206", "Content": "November 26, 2007. I have just returned from Rome where I spent 6 wonderful days. I stayed at Augustus, a very enjoyable place where I had breakfasts in bed while marveling at the ancient Roman ruins right under my window. The room was spotless clean and quiet especially at night time. It had plazma TV with an easy and free-of-charge access to the Net. But what is the best feature about the hotel is its location, in the middle of everything and within walking distance. And finally a few words of praise for the staff, especially, Romano. I dont know what I would have done without their help and excellent knowledge of the city. They go out of their way to try to help a lone traveler, like me, who cannot but feel lost in a not-so-tourist friendly city like Rome. Thank you, Romano. One last word, about the price. I found this hotel thru comparing prices on the Internet offered by various travel agencies. Then I called the hotel directly and asked if they could accommodate me at the lowest price I could find, and they did. The only negative comment I can make, I wish the morning croissants could be fresh, not those commercial cellophane wrapped pieces of sweet bread.

My second thought was that I had been scammed. There is zero resemblance of a hotel, either from the outside or the entryway. A lobby does not exist. The entryway is in shambles and I would recommend wearing a hard hat. The hotel is on the second floor of a commercial building. A couple positive points. One friendly english speaking desk person in the afternoon. The one at night fills the hallway with cigarette smoke. The room was clean and relatively spacious. The internet connection was a plus. The bed was satisfactory. We did enjoy the air conditioning and natural light. Great restaurant recommendation. A few negative points. Breakfast was sort of a joke. After dodging a few cars and scooters to a cafe across the street, our morning hunger was only halfway satisfied with a pastry and capuccino. The neighborhood is not the best, neither for location nor for security. People traffic could be heard at all times going up and down the hallway and car traffic as well. The bathroom was okay, but good luck bending over to wash your feet in the shower. Overall, I would prefer a hotel...with a lobby and where all the floors in the building were filled with other hotel guests, not god knows who else.
