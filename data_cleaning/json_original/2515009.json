The rooms were clean and well kept, extra pillows, separate toilette from the shower area. We were on the back side of the hotel, and it was quiet which made for a peaceful nights sleep. Staff was friendly. The stairs were steep, but there is a small elevator if you need it. Staff brought our bags up for us. Water pressure in the shower was good, and it was always hot enough. We found it to be a very charming place! The room isn't gigantic, but we assume it is fairly on par for other places in Paris (especially for a hotel that had a bit more of a historical feel to it). It is also close to a couple of metros, which is convenient.

Overall a wonderful stay and the cost performance (around 150 euros/night for twin shower) is excellent! Pros: Location - walking distance to metro, only 8 euros by taxi from Opera Roissy Bus stop. Service!!! - such friendly and attentive staff. One example is when we asked to arrange a cab in the morning on our last day, the staff came to our room to let us know the cab was about to come, and took our luggage. Such efficient and smart service. Couldn't praise enough about the service, from the booking process to the end. Wifi- no dramas. The kind you can just select the network and enter the password, not the one you have to log in every time on a web browser. Character - the exterior and interior are just beautiful. Lovely, warm and welcoming reception area. Cons: The only thing is the room (twin standard shower) was quite small, and there were no shower amenities i.e. shampoo etc. nor was there a fridge/ kettle. I only mention this because for the same price range there was another hotel we stayed at whose room was much bigger with more amenities, albeit having much LESS helpful staff. Overall an excellent stay. I'll come back, if I can book as it seems very popular, and rightly so!

The hotel has a great friendly feel and every member of staff that we met seemed to genuinely want to make our stay as special as they possibly could.

Those good feelings continued when we opened the door to our very comfortable room. What could be nicer than standing on the balcony and taking in the Parisian street scene below? The room was tasteful and more than adequately sized considering the dimensions of the usual Parisian hotel room. The bathroom was well-appointed and the bed was very comfortable.

One of the reasons we chose the New Orient (after consulting TripAdvisor) was its handy location in the 8th arrondissement, and we weren't disappointed.

We never tried eating breakfast there because we wanted to eat on the streets of Paris as much as possible. Just down the street, there is a wonderful bakery. Directly across the street from the hotel, there is a small market, where we bought snacks and water. We were in room 2, which had a shower and bath. Yes, it is small but we only needed it for our young son. We found the room to be a little small but just fine for the 3 of us. We had 3 medium size suit cases and were fine with the space. We found the beds to be very comfortable. As already mentioned by others, 2 metro stations (Metro and Villiers) are very close by, about a couple blocks away. We found a street near the Villiers station to be full of life in the morning with all the bakeries, produce markets and butcher shops open. We came back at night to find that the restaurants are not on that same street but also nearby. We took the TGV train from the airport to Disneyland Paris upon arrival. It was easy to manage our luggage and toddler. We even managed to get from Disneyland Paris to New Orient by train and metro. However, we were didn't think it would be so easy to go back to the airport from Paris via metro, especially since we would be going during rush hour. Catherine helped us order a taxi, and we got there without any troubles. It cost about 55 euros plus tip. We think that it wouldn't have been that much less if we took the metro for the 3 of us.

Further, we had an unfortunate incident of wine spilling on the sheets (to which we were both horrified) and the staff didn't make a fuss about it and had them cleaned; and we weren't charged. Location: It is located in the 8th district which is nice as its not touristy and well priced. It is convientiently located close to the subway station, about a brisk 20 minute walk to the Arc and about a 45 minute walk to the Louvre. There is a little market street about 2-3 blocks down the street where you can grab any fresh pastries or other sundries. There is a grocery store directly across the street, which is very helpful if you are eating on the run. If you are into walking a lot (which we are) this is a great place and location to stay. Rooms: While not big rooms, I didn't mind the size. They are about the standard size of a 2nd or 3rd bedroom in your typical American single family home. The bathrooms were recently updated and had all new fixtures. Our room had a balcony with a view of the street and flowers on the window sil.

The Hotel was spotless, the room (22) on the 5th floor, was a perfect size quite large with a lovely old wardrobe with hanging space, large mirror, drawers and shelves, ensuite bathrooms with over bath shower, the bed was large and also very comfortable. Watch out when opening the lift door opening over the stairs half way between floors in case someone is passing on the stairs. Lovely views from the balcony, where we had a table and chairs, and enjoyed the evening with a bottle of wine from the supermarket opposite. Lovely to return to after a tiring day of walking around the city, and such a beautiful city too. No night time noise from the street below. Nice continental breakfast with fresh orange juice, fresh rolls, croissants, jams and lovely coffee. The staff were so friendly despite my poor attempts to speak French. At my email request the Hotel pre booked a restaurant of my choice before we arrived for the Sunday night of our arrival and confirmed the booking by email. When we eventually got to the hotel late after a lengthy RER train and metro ride (next time I'm getting a taxi despite the expense) the hotel staff booked a taxi for us to take us to the restaurant 7eme Vin (which was great). As our flight wasn't till late on the 4th day the Hotel brought our suitcase down and allowed us to leave it all day. Definitely a Hotel that\u2019s worth the price of the rooms.

The bathroom was larger than expected and well appointed. Everything worked great including the water pressure and temperature controls. A small balcony was accessible through a pair of french doors and was furnished with a small table, two chairs, and a big flower box overflowing with bright red gardenias. It was fun to sit and watch Parisians go about their daily lives while sipping wine and enjoying a macaron or a nice frommage. The walls are typical of older construction, i.e. lacking sound-proofing, but the management has thoughtfully limited the volume control on the television. The bed and linens were very comfortable. The room was clean and the maid staff keep it that way for the duration of our stay. The reception staff were attentive and professional. The one curiosity was the elevator providing service to landings in-between floors.

First, while there is an elevator to help in getting bags to the room, some care is still needed as the elevator stops a few steps down on the spiral stairway. Still, if we managed fine, other folks should be able to manage as well. Second, and this is very subjective, the hair dryer is of the built-in type, rather than a more powerful plug-in variety. But these small criticisms are far outweighed by the advantages. The staff were friendly, giving us advice for dining, using the best metro routes, and rental car drop-off discussion. (For those who may be thinking of doing what we did, dropping a car off at the Rue de Barri location and using the drop-box, the car is to be left in the underground Vinci parkade at the end of Rue de Barri, the drop-box is at the corner of one of booths down there; the security guard helped us out.)

The location was wonderful because it was within walking distance to anywhere we cared to go. The Managers, Catherine and Josef Wehrle and staff spoke English and were very helpful with directions and advice. Needless to say, for all these reasons we highly recommend this hotel.

They had made and provided their credit card for 4 evenings in a Paris hotel 3 days prior to their arrival. The hotel didn\u2019t have a phone number listed and although he had sent several e-mails attempting to confirm their reservation, he never got a confirmation. I\u2019m bringing this up so you all benefit from these two points: 1) It is wise to call hotels directly rather than relying on the internet for confirmation. 2) Without a written confirmation of your room, some Paris hotels may actually re-book your room if they get a higher price from someone who is there in person. Most importantly, those two points allow me to elaborate on how the New Orient demonstrate high standards and how incredibly helpful they really are. We took the couple mentioned in the previous paragraph who were in search of a room back with us to the New Orient to see if perhaps they had a vacancy for that night. They did not. However, Catherine started making calls to hotels to help the couple find a room. This couple wasn\u2019t staying there, and since the New Orient was full for the rest of the week, the New Orient had nothing to monetarily gain. Monetary gain wasn\u2019t her motive. She is a kind hearted, good person who simply wanted to help. After about an hour of calling every hotel she knew, she called them a cab and gave the driver instructions to quickly take them to the official Tourist office to help them find a room for the evening. This type of service is what elevates the New Orient to an exception hotel. This level of service extended to the weekend staff as well. I specifically wrote down the name of the gentleman at the front desk who helped us so I could personally acknowledge him, but have unfortunately since lost my slip of paper. I thought his name was Michael, but the only male name I could find on the hotel website was Amar. I do apologize if I\u2019ve acknowledge the wrong person, but I am confident that no matter who sits at that front desk, the exceptional service remains the same! We had hoped that there would be an additional cancellation to enable us to stay at the New Orient through Monday, but that was not in the cards. On Saturday, Amar took a great deal of time to go over hotel options available at and near the airport. Once we made our selection, he called the hotel, booked our room, printed out the e-mail confirmation and gave us written directions to keep us from getting lost. All this took well over an hour, and he stayed with it as if he were staying there himself! Definitely service above and beyond the call of duty!", "Date": "October 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brisbane, Australia", "Title": "\u201cExcellent location - lovely quaint hotel\u201d", "Author": "LeaSpringfield", "ReviewID": "UR119609554", "Content": "My recent trip to Europe meant that I commenced and finished my holiday in Paris so I stayed at this hotel 4 nights at the start and 2 nights at the finish.

Do not expect a large room as they are typically Parisian sized rooms that are well presented with older furnishings with the wardrobe containing an electronic safe. The bed was just right for us as we both like a medium to hard mattress and had no lumps or bumps to contend with. Street noise during both day and the night was non-existent due to the double glazing but at night there was also very little street traffic as it is in a residential area. We heard no noise from adjoining rooms that were occupied during our stay.

Our room was very clean and comfortable with an ensuite which included a bath & shower. The shower had great water pressure and was very welcoming after a long day of sightseeing! Beds were also very comfortable! Our room was street facing and unlike other reviews, we didn't find the street noisy at all when the windows were open and we didn't hear anything when the windows were closed at night.

I think it was Restaurant Acacia? This was ok, filled a gap but we didn't eat here again and i don't think any of us would recommend it. We had breakfast in the hotel on our first morning and this is our exception I mention in the title. We didn't actually think very much of what was on offer for breakfast and in fact didn't eat breakfast here again. There is a lovely boulangerie 1/2 block away from the hotel (out the front door & turn rightm walk 10 seconds & it's on the corner opposite you!). They do lovely coffee and pain au chocolat as well as the usual French breakfast fare. This is closed on a Monday morning so we found another one on a street directly opposite this boulangerie (opposite Hotel Relais Monceau on corner of Rue du Rocher) which was good but the best one is definitely the one closest to the hotel. You can sit in both to eat your breakfast at leisure rather than walking & eating. A plus point of this hotel is that it has a Franprix supermarket (not very big from the outside but is very surprisingly excellent - has everything you could possibly want and more in there) directly opposite the front door. This is open until about 9pm/10pm most nights except Sunday when it is only open until 1.30pm. Get any water, etc here. Transport-wise Villiers (on both Metro lines 2 & 3) is the nearest metro station and this is a 2 minute walk from the hotel. Villiers is a great station as it is quite central and the lines serving it are excellent re getting to alot of places you'd want to go to. It is quite easy to walk to alot of places from here weather permitting and if you are so inclined. We had beautiful weather and so took the opportunity to walk as much as we could. On our 2nd night we had dinner in a local italien - Pizza Scusi - which was lovely and I would recommend eating here at some point. Very nice pizza and lovely house red! We did want to return on the Sunday night (it opens on a Sunday night which is unusual in the area so beware) but check when they are open from. We walked in at around 7pm and were told they weren't open yet, that we had to come back after 7.30pm. I have seen elsewhere that say they are open from 7pm. This was annoying as we had to find somewhere else that night and found an Indian on Boulevard des Batignolles near the pharmacy. It was actually quite nice.

There is a small supermarket right in front of the hotel. We checked-in, and found a very nice room waiting for us. A little bit small, but you can't ask for better in Paris with this rates. We took the elevator every time, as the stairs are a little bit tiring. Our luggage were broght to us in the room a few minutes later. At the desk there was a beatiful card signed by the owners congratulating on the wedding, and a photo frame as a gift. A very nice touch. The bathroom is adequated and worked very well for us. I found the street a little noisy at night but you can't hear anything with the windows closed. There were no problems to speak english with the staff. They are all very polite and ready to help for whatever you need. I borrowed an adaptor to charge my laptop with a 20 euro deposit which they gave me back when I returned the device five days later. In the end, when we were leaving to take the bus to go to the airport, the owner chased us down in the street saying he had a better solution for us. As it turned out, their daughter were arriving that same night, so they offered us a ride to the airport. A very nice gesture, as taking the bus and going to the airport with the luggage is always a struggle. So, we got ourselves a ride and talked a lot with Catherine, the owner, who is very simpatic, and told us about their hotel and how much they love what they do. She wouldn't take money for the ride.

We stayed at this hotel for 6 days, and our two twin bed room was on the first floor, facing away from the street. It was relatively clean although our first impression was that it was very small and odd that the toilet was across the room from the bath/sink. After a day, we got used to the room and it was comfortable. The hotel was in a nice location and very close to the Metro Stations Villiers and Rome. My friend and I enjoy walking so we frequented the shops close by (over by the supermarket Monoprix), and it was a short walk to Parc Monceau (5-10 min) and relatively pleasant walk to Montmartre (20-25 min). If you walk along the main stretch headed over to Montmartre (Bd des Batignolles) there is even a Starbucks on the way (it was her lifeline so we thought we'd pass this tidbit on). There is a really good restaurant close by called Patio proven\u00e7al (also close to Monoprix), that was our favorite of the ones that the staff had recommended. If you have time definitely go to this restaurant. We also liked the location in the sense that the immediate area was not a tourist trap and it felt very safe. The housekeeping staff had a habit of leaving the windows open after cleaning our room but after only one request from my friend to the front desk to keep the window closed this never happened again. The TV had channels in French, German and English. All of the staff we encountered spoke English well and were extremely helpful. We had an early morning flight on the day of departure but they were very accomodating, allowed us to check out the night before and called a taxi for us. My only negative comment would be that if you are a very light sleeper or extremely sensitive to noise, this might not be your kind of hotel. There will be rumbling noises, I am assuming from the Metro lines being so close by, all times of day, and occasionally you can hear your neighbors walking, talking or flushing the toilet. Because the windows faced inward you sometimes hear the dishes, the garbage being emptied, or side conversations when they were open, but that was not a huge deal. Good thing my friend and I were so busy most of the day and by the time we came back to the hotel we were too tired to worry about that!

It's true that the rooms are quite small and simple. Double bed (which we found to be very comfortable), wardrobe with two drawers, two bedside cabinets, dressing table and a mirror. We stayed in a room with an en-suite shower and found this to be perfectly acceptable (the water pressure was great and we never ran out of hot water); some people have said the shower rooms are a little small but we had no problems with it at all. The view was of the street, which was pretty quiet. Speaking of which... we stayed there in August and found that almost every shop within a one-minute walk was closed. Two things: 1) shops seem to close on Mondays. 2) The whole area goes on holiday in August for something called 'conges annuels'. We didn't know about this - oops. However, it wasn't the end of the world at all - we simply walked down to the Place de Clichy and found that pretty much everything was still open. We recommend \"Le Melrose\" (near the Place de Clichy) for French cuisine at 39 Euros per person or Hippopotamus (also near the Place de Clichy) for American-style dining, if that's your thing. The staff at the hotel were always friendly, helpful and polite. We only had breakfast on one day; it was basic but very nice - croissants and jam, that sort of thing. The hotel is quite easy to find, a few minutes' walk from Villiers metro station, although I think you can also access it quite easily from the Europe metro station, too. Villiers metro station is quite well placed (on both Line 2 and Line 3, if memory serves) for doing the typical touristy things in Paris. We visited the Eiffel Tower, La Defense, Les Champs Elysees, the cathedral at Notre Dame and none of the relevant stations were more than twenty minutes away. No tea or coffee-making facilities in the room, incidentally - which was a bit of a surprise. There's a March\u00e9 Franprix (a mini-supermarket, basically) literally opposite the hotel which sells all kinds of stuff. That's open until 9pm and they weren't on conges annuels when we visited, despite it being August. All in all If you're looking for five-star luxury, this isn't it. But if you're looking for somewhere that's really nice but on a relatively low budget, this is a great hotel to stay at and they'll make you feel welcome.

I agree with most of the comments read here, so I have little to add. Absolute cleanliness, staff friendliness, excellent location (two metro station just a few hundred meters away), quiet and elegant neighborhood, good breakfast, great quality/price ratio. All equipment (shower, hairdryer, TV, ...) worked fine. I really hate malfunctioning hotel showers and that is usually one of the very first thing I check, luckily I found that mine was perfectly manageable (and so the rest)! A bed very comfortable and quiet surroundings, no problem to sleep without worry. WiFi is free and worked well even with my quite old smartphone. Hotel is really fine but I think that some caveats are needed: - the hotel has just 30 rooms and is deservedly esteemed so I think it's advisable to book in advance (I did it one month in advance). - rooms could be less spacious than expected. My single room on 6th floor (the uppermost one) was perfect for one person, apart the built-in wardrobe put in one corner of the room, which had barely the minimum space required to host just my mid-sized suitcase put in horizontal and had quite small shelves. Not really annoying, there was enough space anyway, but better to know that in advance. I suppose that double rooms or maybe even other single rooms could have more spacious wardrobes. - stairs are narrow and steep (they reminded me of some Amsterdam's hotels, even if not so much steep!). Lift stops at landings between adjacent floors (e.g.: 3-4) and not exactly at floor, so you have to go down a few steps. - continental breakfast is not from a buffet table, glutton be warned! As for me, I found it to be very good and abundant enough for my morning hunger. - TV remote has a key to switch between satellite channels and DVB-T channels, use it if you want to see all channels! The district is elegant and quiet but not dull, thanks also to some lively zones with restaurants. I didn't tested restaurants in the neighborhood (apart one of the many brasseries near Villiers Metro station, nothing special) so I can't say anything about that, I just noticed there are many. All in all, I agree with a comment read here that said you haven't to expect a four stars hotel at budget price but for sure I stayed in many three-stars hotel much less enjoyable than two-stars New Orient and at higher price. New Orient is now my top-choice hotel in Paris, for sure I'll try to book there next time in the \"Ville Lumiere\".", "Date": "August 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cA completely wonderful trip, would definitely return!\u201d", "Author": "sheano", "ReviewID": "UR116518407", "Content": "Had a delightful stay at the New Orient Hotel.

It was cosy enough for us and we only really used it as a base of operations. The elevator was difficult to navigate with two of us and a suitcase!

The hotel was immaculately clean and the cleaning staff were great and even laid out my magazine on the bed neatly for me while I was out for when I arrived back. The staff, well what can I say they were brilliant. They knew a lot about the local area and were very keen to help and exceptionally friendly. They also all had excellent English.

We came for our honeymoon and, after mentioning such in an email once, we found in our room a gift and an adorable congratulatory card from the owners. Unlike some of the \"ritzy-er\" hotels that look like fancy hotels you'd find anywhere else, New Orient definitely makes you feel like you're in Paris. True, the rooms are small, but it's Paris--most rooms are small. The size was fine for the two of us. The balconies--complete with a little table and pretty flowers-- are beautiful and the rooms are quaint. The service is exceptional. The location is a good 15 minute walk to l'Arc de Triomphe and a 25-30 minute walk to Notre Dame, Eiffel Tower, and others. At first I thought I'd mind this, but we really enjoyed coming back to a non-touristy place to rest. Also the Europe Metro stop is two blocks away--which we used quite a bit. The neighborhood is fabulous--we walked through an amazing farmers' market today on Rue de Levis. So many wonderful boulangeries, patisseries, bistros, etc. right down the street with all of the atmosphere and the authentic feel and without the crazy Paris traffic noise and millions of lost tourists.

When I booked the room I left notice that our plane would be in late (after 11 PM) and the receptionist was waiting for us to come in and left the front doors unlocked for us, which I thought was especially nice once I learned that the doors were locked after 10 PM. All the different people at the desk spoke very good English, and seemed tolerant and appreciative when I tried to speak to them in my broken French. If you are traveling with a lot of luggage, I would recommend asking for a room on one of the lower floors as you have to walk up a few narrow spiral stairs even to get to the elevator. They were happy to give us directions, recommend restaurants, put in wake-up calls and call for taxis. When the receptionist (not sure if he was the owner or not) saw me struggling with carrying my luggage down the stairs on the day of check-out, he immediately jumped up and insisted on carrying them for me not only down the stairs but also out to the taxi. As for the room itself, it was small compared to American standards, so we found it necessary to actually use the wardrobe in the room. There was free Wi-Fi, and we had no trouble using it. The room was clean, the bed and pillows were very comfortable and warm, and there was climate control in the room. The balcony was the big seller for me though, it was wonderful to step out onto it and breathe in Paris in the morning. The hotel is across the street from a grocery store, in walking distance of a street market, an atm machine, and close to 3 different metro stations. Be warned though, this is not a party or nightlife neighborhood. People are inside asleep by 10 PM and businesses are closed on the weekends. There are few people on the streets late at night, but it was very safe. Personally I really enjoyed this after visiting noisy tourist traps in the daytime because it meant that I could have some peace and the quiet made for a good night's sleep.

We chose the New Orient Hotel based on the reviews on here and the price. I booked a Twin Superior room which had a balcony and a bath. The hotel is located a short walk from Villiers metro station. I was surprised that the hotel is only 2 star when I think it could really be more like a 3 star hotel. When we checked in, the man at the reception was very helpful, took our bags and showed us to the lift. Our room was on the second floor and we had a great view of the typical Parisienne street and a lovely little balcony. The road was quite noisy but as soon as you closed the balcony doors, you couldn't hear any noise from outside. The soundproofing was excellent. The room itself wasn't what I had expected - judging by the pics on the website I thought we were going to get a room which had more antique furniture - but the room we were given was clean, a little more modern (which suited us fine) and was big enough for the two of us and our cases. Beds were really comfy and we even had a tv! The room also had free wifi - very useful for checking Tripadvisor before we went out to dinner ;) Our room was cleaned spotlessly everyday and the staff were always very welcoming and helpful. On the last day we had breakfast in the hotel and that was cheap and filling at only 8 euros each for the continental breakfast. I guess the only things that could be improved in the room would be the lighting and the amount of plug sockets. I think there were two plug sockets in the room, which is fine, but we're two girls who are blow drying our hair, straightening our hair, laptop plugged in, phone on charge - an extension cable would have been useful ;) Also, there wasn't a main light hanging from the ceiling - just three small lamps - one by the dressing table and one each by the twin beds. It wasn't an issue at all until it came to get ready for nights out - we ended up elbowing each other for the prime spot in the bathroom mirror! Easily solved I suppose with some higher watt bulbs?

The hotel is located on a quiet street in the heart of the 8th district near Villiers and Europe metro stations. There are a number of other hotels on the street, as well as restaurants and bistros offering cuisine from different cultures. As an aside. If you are arriving from Paris Gard du Nord, I would suggest you consider a walk to La Chapelle and catch the metro to Villiers, as this seems to involve a lot less walking than the proposed Magenta to Gare St Lazare (long walk to hotel) method. Check in was perhaps the most simple I have ever had in my life. I simply stated my name and was given the room key. No ID check. No Credit Card swipe. Nothing. We were asked if we would like breakfast the next day and were given instructions on how to find the room. That was it. The room itself was a double with shower with a view overlooking the main street. The windows can be opened to allow fresh air and the sounds of Paris to reach your senses. As we were on one of the lower floors, there was a concern that street noise (with the windows closed) would be a problem, but the sound proofing was very good and this was never an issue throughout the stay. The bed was very comfortable and although the room was not large, it was not restrictive in its size. The bathroom was much the same and the shower had both a good temperature and power range to it. The walls are a little thin (or maybe my partner has very good ears) as she could hear every word that another couple were saying in another room on the floor. Breakfast was fairly standard, with two different menus to choose from. Nothing to write home about, but perfectly adequate in itself. The Wi-Fi is free and easy to setup. The security password is available in the rooms (as opposed to those hotels that make you ask for it) Other things worth noting. The room was cleaned and tidied every day to a very good standard and every time we passed through reception area we were given a friendly welcome by the member of staff on duty.

We were not disappointed. During our stay, the hallways were being remodelled slightly to comply with some new building regulations, but there was no noise from this work while we were in the hotel. Our room was well-appointed and clean, making good use of the space. The furnishings were tasteful and everything in the bathroom was in full working order. The only exception was the lack of fan in the bathroom, but nowhere we stay seems to have one - are they really that rare? Paris was relatively cold during our stay, but our room stayed cosy and warm, and had the best hotel bed I've had the pleasure of sleeping on - firm mattress, big soft pillows and warm duvet. The walls were very thin - we were woken up one night by an excitable couple talking loudly on the phone, but they had just arrived and he had proposed on the plane on the way over, so it was forgiveable! Other than that it was a very peaceful hotel, possibly attracting guests who are in Paris for the culture rather than the nightlife. Location-wise, it's not bad. There are a couple of small good museums very close by (particularly the Nissim De Camondo), and it's easy to get to by bus or metro from the Gare Du Nord. We found that the area closed down on Sundays more than some other areas - we spent a good long while trying to find a late lunch snack, but came up with nothing, only to hop on the metro to Montparnasse and find that everywhere was open! The number 21 bus was a good friend to us during our stay, going from the near-by Gare St Lazare right through the centre of the big museums district. In fact, I would highly recommend any potential visitors to Paris to find a bus map - it would have done us the world of good! There was a very personal feel to the service, the staff knew who you were and picked up conversations where they left off the previous evening. We didn't try the breakfast, but the room looked lovely. There is free wifi throughout the hotel, and a computer that is free to use in the lobby.

And the room was lovely, nicely furnished, clean and with a good amount of storage to make up for not being particularly spacious. My only hesitation for returning to this hotel on subsequent stays is how VERY thin the walls between rooms are. I don't blame the hotel for this, as it's more likely a problem they inherited from the original renovations, but ear plugs are a must for undisturbed sleep (although, I'd like to say a big congratulations to the couple next to us who just got engaged.

I'm not sure how big the rooms with multiple beds are, but given the size of the double, I would not recommend sharing a room with a friend unless you are really fond of each other. Our room overlooked the courtyard; it was very quiet all three nights. The street was not very busy so I imagine if you have a street-side room it would be just as quiet.

Had coffe and a croissant at the next door bakery, took a walk past a nice park down to Arc de Triomphe, subway back again, and by the time we got back to the hotel, our room was ready and they had even put our suitcases in the room! We had a nice room with a french balcony toward the street. The street may have some traffic during daytime, but at night it was pretty silent (and the doors are pretty soundproof). Two bakeries close by, a small one next door, and a slightly larger one at Rue Larribe (between the hotel and Villiers metro station). Small grocery store across the hotel, (mind the hotel room has no fridge). Nice, clean bathrooms, which seemed fairly new (we had a room with a shower - nice pressure). Small steep stairway in the hotel, floor space could fit two small suitcases, but I would probably think twice if I was going there with heavy loads of luggage. They do have a tiny elevator though. They were doing maintenance in the hallway when we were there, but there was no noise that bothered us, and maintenance has to bee done, so I'm not going to complain about that! Better to do it now than during high season I assume. All in all, a wonderful and charming non-chain 2-star hotel, with excellent service and great value for money! Free wifi is always a bonus too.

We also liked the restaurant Il Pomo D'Oro for an Italian dinner on Boulevard des Batignolles and Savoye Caffe for breakfast on 13 Bld de Courcelles both only a block from this wonderful hotel. And while it's a tad north of the action around the Seine and along the Champs-Elysees (it will take you 30+ minutes to walk to the Arc de Triomphe) if you learn the Metro (which is very easy) you will have all of this wonderful city at your disposal without the high prices of other hotels that may be more centrally located.

The room was rather small (as we'd expected), but had a lovely little balcony watching over the street (Rue de Constantinople). We actually asked for a balcony in the comments section of our reservation form, so I strongly advise you to do the same (only not when I'm coming to stay there again). The area wasn't as central/lively as a hotel in the heart of the Latin Quarter would probably have been, but I think I actually prefer it that way, as its location was perfect for us: a very short walking distance from an amazing Brioche Dor\u00e9e bakery for breakfasts (among other options, of course - but that's what we preferred), a selection of quiet (though pricey) bars for night time, and two metro stations that allowed us to easily get to the less quiet and more vibrant parts of the city. It's also quite a short walk (around 15 minutes?) to the Opera / Galeries Lafayette area, if that's your thing, and of course the streets around it felt completely safe to walk around, day or middle-of-the-night. Also, over these 8 days I think we've probably met the entire hotel reception staff, and every single one of them, without exception, was ever-so welcoming and helpful, and it's probably worth to keep in mind we don't speak any French (but I think that goes for Paris generally - English gets you what you want and to wherever you wanna be without any problems whatsoever). Bottom line - This was our first trip to Paris, so I don't know how it feels to live in other parts of the city, but I do know that next time we're there we'll have to be in a *really* adventurous mood if we're to look for another hotel.

Not a small achievement for a French place, as people who have visited this country can tell you. That was my first and only criteria to choose this hotel, and the quick & friendly email responses from the owner closed the deal. I was then happily surprised, upon checking-in, by the immaculate cleanliness, friendly service and great location (near subway entrance, convenience store across the street, walking distance of Opera & Montmartre). It was a romantic getaway and room 22 was perfect, but more impressive was the willingness shown by Ms Wehrle to ensure that flowers and chocolates were in place before our arrival, as instructed. [I am ashamed to say that I did consider writing a glowing report on this website at the time, but got lazy and never got to do it. I am happy to put this to right today] I didn\u2019t even think of calling another hotel when planning a recent stay in Paris last month (June 2010). This time to meet a London-based friend. That is when I realised that the proximity of the Gare St Lazare makes it a great location for Eurostar users. Same helpful staff, clean room (quieter as in the back of the building) and excellent bathroom facilities (yes, I know, hard to believe that all three can be found together in France!). Of course, being located in a character Parisian building, not one room is identical, the plumbing can be heard sometimes and the lift is in itself a funny experience that you will talk about for years to come. But that is part of the charm of this hotel that so many soulless glass & concrete establishments lack today. And without the good advice given by the New Orient Hotel staff, I would never have found the hidden gem that is the Printemps Galerie Lafayette top floor restaurant, nearby. The awards received by the New Orient Hotel since my first stay three years ago, given by well-know travelling guides and noticed by me on the entrance wall, are testimony of the excellence shown by this well-run establishment.

Our first 3 left bank nights were in a more expensive 3-star hotel with a fabulous location close to the Seine and the islands and the Latin Quarter etc. We grew attached to that area and were reluctant to leave at the end of our three days, but once we walked into the New Orient we ended up wishing we had stayed all six nights there! Compared to our first hotel, the New Orient was 25 euros cheaper per night, and for less money we got a lovely room nearly twice the size of the other, with a more spacious bath and two balconies, a much better bed and fluffier pillows, new double-glazed windows, in a quieter area. It also had a much, much better AC -- we had a bad air conditioner in the previous hotel (Acte V), which can ruin a trip during a hot spell. The New Orient staff and hosts were incredibly attentive and friendly, the room was very nicely appointed and clean, and both the private and public spaces are extremely welcoming. The expected downside compared to our first hotel was supposed to be the greater distance to the riverside and left bank attractions, but to our surprise and delight, the New Orient\u2019s location in the upper 8th was not a downside after all. It's in a tidy and peaceful part of the city, on a quiet street, with many nearby brasseries, boulangeries, shops and cafes that service the locals rather than catering just to tourists. It\u2019s still easily walking distance to Montmartre or the Louvre or Tulleries Gardens, etc. And with several nearby metro/RER stops, getting around was a snap.

The location of the hotel with close proximity to the Metro (Villiers Station), many surrounding restaurants, a grocery/convenience store across the street, bakeries galore and a well fitted out laundrette across the street and a couple of stores down made for a perfect stay. Before I go any further I really should mention how friendly the staff were and how they were really there to help me and my partner in our stay at Paris. Unable to speak French there really wasn't a language barrier at all as we could communicate with them in English. The room we stayed in was a Superior Twin Room as all the double rooms had been booked out. But because we were on a budget and bookings were made very last minute, Micheline was able to speak to the owners who were happy to offer me the Superior Twin Room at the same price of the Double Room for the four nights. They also arranged for the two beds to be joined together for us as well. On arrival after our train ride from Amsterdam we were glad to make it to our accomodation. But on opening the door to our room we were presented with our own little bit of Paris. Honestly I was surprised by the size of the room, the fitout and cleanliness of it. I don't know how the star rating works in Paris but this was nothing like what I would expect from a two star hotel. The accomodation I would say personally was four stars, maybe it's things like room service which aren't provided which make it a two star, but when you're in Paris who needs room service. I could go on forever about how good this place is but I won't as I'll leave you to find out for yourselves.

The reviews were spot on for this hotel. We lucked into a 100 Euro per night special, so it seemed like a great deal for a very clean, quiet hotel. The rooms may be small, but we've definitely had smaller rooms in other European countries. We had an actual double bed, a desk, an armoire and two little nightstand ledges for books, glasses, etc. Our bathroom was nice and fresh with a shower and sink/vanity and toilet. This hotel is close to the both the Europe and Villiers metro stops and we felt very safe arriving at any time of day or night. It seemed to be a little farther walk to places then is mentioned on the website, but it is so easy to take the metro, that we most often did that. If you don't mind staying in a quiet area, this is a great hotel. If you want a little more lively area to just step out into, this is probably not the best choice. But again, it's so easy to get places via the close metro stops (both of which took bills in the ticket machines!) that it really doesn't matter.

Hotel New Orient is primarily value for money, suited to easy going tourists who want a clean room with clean facilities and a safe neighborhood to stay in. Positioned 300 m from Villiers Metro, ATMs, pubs and casual local restaurants, it offers the experience of life as a local. Walking through nearby daily market streets like Rue de Levis, purchasing baguettes and pastries and browsing bric-a-brac added a dimension often lost to tourists in 5-star hotels and those only strolling the Champs Elysees. We found breakfast at the store across the road and from the nearby markets selling fresh food every morning. Admittedly the mid-staircase 3-man (or one-man + 2 bags) elevator is unusual, but understandable as a retrofit to an old building; the beds are comfortable and our bathroom fixtures brand-new. The air-conditioning does appears set for the whole building which can be irritating, but easy access to 2 balconies in our room helped with breeze. It can be noisy with light traffic easily heard from 6 am. Daily servicing meant clean, tidy rooms to come home to. There is also free wi-fi internet access and public computer in the lobby. Their English speaking staff are helpful and are happy to recommend and book restaurants for you, as well as direct you as required. We found no problems with the Metro service, where a Metro station is within 500m of almost all the famous sites and museums.

They also only had showers and it is really nice being able to have a bath after a heavy days sight seeing!", "Date": "April 13, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pottstown, PA", "Title": "\u201cPerfect location!\u201d", "Author": "ameslouise", "ReviewID": "UR7199803", "Content": "This hotel was exactly what we were looking for - tourist class hotel with quaint rooms, comfortable lobby and a local flavor.

The bathroom was small but clean and nice with fantastic new shower heads (that were better than in some American 4 star hotels I have been in). Nearby conveniences include a grocery store across the street, laundry mat, liquor store, plenty of cafes (we particulary liked the Cafe Monceau) and the Villiers Metro stop with access to two lines just a couple blocks away. A pleasant surprise was the market street on Rue de Levis a few blocks away. Fruit, vegetable, meat and exotic food vendors are mixed in with WONDERFUL clothing stores, bakeries, etc. We didn't see many tourists in this area - just tons of locals doing their shopping. The general neighborhood was pleasant, clean, and not touristy at all. The staff at the hotel was very helpful with restaurant recommendations and making reservations for us.

The location is close (less than 5 minute walk) to two metro stations and also close to a major train station (the one that goes to Versailles). Several good bistros are close by as well as bakeries. A nice grocery store is directly across the street where you can get snacks and water. Breakfast is availabe for 10 euro if you tell them the night before.

First off, let me start by saying that I was excited to stay at this hotel after the reviews I had read previously. My friend and I were traveling Europe, and chose this hotel for our 2 night stay before we left for Italy. We arrived and realized that the hotel was tiny, and just barely average, but we weren't going to let it bother us. We went out that night, and came home at what we considered to be a reasonable hour while on vacation (130am). The man at the desk gave us filthy looks as we walked up the stairs and mumbled soemthing under his breath. We then got a call that we needed to go downstairs and speak to him. He started ranting and raving about he hated george bush, and then HE CALLED US PROSTITUTES. He said he didn't want \"our kind\" staying in his hotel (please keep in mind that we are both professional women in our 30's and were dressed extremely consevatively in jeans and long jackets). We were shocked and appauled and asked to speak to the manager. He refused, and started giggling smugly, and then told us that he was going to call the police!!! He then came out from behind the desk, and started screaming in our faces about only strippers staying out that late, and how we were students who loved George Bush (I still don't understand the Bush reference). It got to the point that we were scared to be in his presence (us being 2 women, and him being an extremely irate man, who was very beligerant and intense(we actually had to ask him to step back several times))At this point, we realized that we would never win, and went back upstairs to our room, where we could barely sleep we were so upset. so, if you are looking for a hotel where you will have a strict curfew, and won't feel safe, or comfortable...then I guess you have found the right one.

You can't really walk to the department stores (Lafayette and Printemps) but they're close by metro. Remember to get the 10% coupon for Printemps from the lobby and you can get a 10% coupon for Lafayette if you buy the Paris Visitors Pass at the metro. Our room was on the top floor with a balcony \u2013 the biggest room the hotel offers. We were very comfortable in it during out 7 night stay in Paris. The bathroom was a nice size \u2013 comparable to those in the US and it's new/recently remodeled. The people were very nice and speak English fluently. There were several TV channels \u2013 all in French but for one channel \u2013 CNN. I highly recommend staying at this hotel and will stay here again during our next trip. For first timers to Paris, a little tip... You have to pay to use the restrooms! 2 Euros at most places. Another option is to go to Quick (a local hamburger shop \u2013 like McDonald's) and buy a little drink. The pass code for the restroom is on the receipt.

The rooms have nice furnature. We found the complaints unfounded. It was very hot in Paris when we were there and they have not been able to install air conditioning but are working on it. Our room faced the street and the choice was: noisy and hot with the windows open or really hot with the windows closed. It was tough. The owners are working on it but have to work with the French government to get it done. If it will be hot then you may want to consider this. We found it very easy to get around Paris from the hotel. We liked that it was a neighborhood hotel instead of in the middle of a tourist area.

The area is very nice and within easy reach of the subway. We found it difficult using the subway at first to find the hotel but after initial confusion got there and the New Orient is within easy reach of all the main city centre tourist attractions. There is also a very good lebanese restaurant a hundred yards or so on the other side of the street from the hotel.
