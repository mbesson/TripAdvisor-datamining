I have been meaning to write this review for a year now. To be honest I found this hotel on Trip Advisor and I feel so lucky to have found this hotel. At the time there were about 10 reviews and this hotel was not well known and I took a chance and we were pleasantly surprised. The hotel was beautiful, the room was large and the bed was comfortable. We enjoyed the free wireless internet and the nice little patio outside the bar area. The hotel workers spoke excellent English and they were more than accommodating. We actually would have a drink at the bar before we'd head out or after we'd get back and we'd hang out with them. They were so friendly and knowledgeable. One night the front desk guy even helped my boyfriend get his blackberry back that he had left in the cab on the way home from dinner. It was truly unbelievable. The only downside to this hotel was you had to keep the room key in for the lights to be on so that was a little annoying. Also - the shower doesn't have a door so the water would sort of flood the floor so you'd have to really put a stack of towels down so you didn't have a soaking wet bathroom. It was a really nice shower/bathroom though! This hotel is one block from the subway which we took everywhere and also one block from the taxi stop. We really enjoyed our stay and we would definitely recommend.

As you should make it as special as possible if you're a couple of first timers. Unfortunately this was the case for my bf and I. Had to get this hotel since our first choice wasn't available. We arrived from London via Gare du Nord. It wasn't far, 15 mins by car, charged 40\u20ac but got ripped off since later we realised it was closer than we thought. Hotel is located in 7th Arrondissement. Streets surrounding the hotel are mainly for shopping and eating. Walking distance to lots of restaurants, cafeterias, shopping stores, couple of malls, subway station and cab service one block away. Also there's a mini Walgreens next door, a mini supermarket for those who are not familiarized with this store. ATM's nearby and one in front of hotel. Restaurants and cafeterias end up being absolutely necessary since room service starts very late. No breakfast is provided, just dinner and late night snacks, which are very pricey btw. We also found out they get the food from a retailer, that's why the no breakfast policy, the high price and slow delivery. This hotel is part of the Best Western family which is not a luxury brand kind of hotel, but honesty it exceeded my terribly low expectations. Front desk guys and service in general was ok, just polite people who limited to do their job, no smiles, nothing outstanding. Lobby decor was kinda cool and sexy. There's a tiny open area with a cool ambiance, has a cool angel fountain and a modern cocodrile decor my bf wanted to bring home :) Our room was spacious and pretty clean. Found out our bed was nothing but two single beds joined, not comfortable to sleep in, avoid the middle! Loved the rain shower, no tube though. Creepy corridors at night. Too dark in my opinion. Urges some natural light. Be aware theres no parking lot, since is a boutique hotel. Also, be aware\u00a0of rooms close to the patio, people are really loud very early and staff likes to slam doors. However, our stay was pleasant after all. Location can be determinant in this type of situation. Very close\u00a0to Eiffel Tower, The Louvre and Champs \u00c9lys\u00e9es.

Everywhere is spot on and a bare metal TV hanger on the wall with dodgy looking cables. - Extractor fan in the bathroom wasn't working.
