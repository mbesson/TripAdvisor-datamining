Yes, this hotel is comfortable and convenient to the u-bahn station. Yes, there are plenty of shops and food nearby. However, be prepared to carry your luggage up 3 flights of stairs because there is no elevator. Also, make sure to consider where this hotel is located in relation to the city center. Overall, this hotel was a comfortable stay for a good value and we'd recommend it to others, but it wasn't the best hotel we stayed at in Berlin. -Amy", "Date": "May 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kolding Denmark", "Title": "\u201cFirst time, but not the last time.\u201d", "Author": "pkr6000", "ReviewID": "UR106552640", "Content": "Nice and pleasant family hotel. Very helpfull staff excellent value for money. Excellent breakfast. Hotel is in Spandau Altstadt in the outskirts of Berlin, which assures a nice quet sleep at night, as there is no traffic. U-bahn is directly outside the Hotel, and numerous small restaurants and cafes with very reasonable prices is within 100 meteres of walking distance. Car parking is cheap, we paid 5 euro from Fridfay afternoon til Sunday afternoon. Leav the car, buy a travellers card and save a lot of money and trouble. Berling U bahn is fast and often. If you have trouble with stairs make sure you get a room at the lower floors. If you have BIG problems with stairs, this is maybe not the right hotel for you. Complaints? None. Missed something? No.", "Date": "May 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Nashville", "Title": "\u201cGreat neighborhood, convenient to U-bahn, great breakfast\u201d", "Author": "colt933", "ReviewID": "UR42217899", "Content": "The subway entrance is about 20 paces from the front door of the hotel. The Turkish cafe across the street was fabulous, as was the chocolate store beneath the hotel. The staff was friendly and helpful. The breakfast was very good as well - the yogurt was spectacular. The neighborhood of old town Spandau was beautiful with lots of shops, restaurants, and beergardens. The rooms are fine. There are only two negatives about this place. 1. There is no elevator and you will have to climb at least 2 if not 3 or 4 flights of stairs to get to your room. 2. There is no air conditioning and no ceiling fans in the rooms. But if you don't mind climbing stairs and you don't go in the hot season, then I highly recommend it.", "Date": "September 16, 2009"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Lindenufer", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187323-d232611-Reviews-Hotel_Lindenufer-Berlin.html", "Price": "$95 - $134*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Breite Strasse 36</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">13597</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Berlin</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Germany</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "232611", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/e2/d3/85/hotel-lindenufer.jpg"}}
