The reality is a little less luxury, and rather spartan. The rooms were quite clean, and the heating worked well. No shortage of hot water for showers. Zero points for the view, if that's important to you. The Torre dell'Orologico is nowhere near this place, so if you're expecting a view out onto St. Mark's, you will be very disappointed. The one bit of service we found annoying was that they did not (and would not) provide an iron and ironing board in the room.

The suite is acutally a very spacious, luxurious apartment within 30 second walking distance from St. Marco square. There is a kitchenette which is perfect for self-catering meals. Two very luxurious bathrooms. Two bedrooms and a large livingroom. The apartment is very well furnished and beautifully decorated. Very clean with daily housekeeping. Air conditioning worked very well. The close proximity to St. Marco makes it very easy to find the hotel--which is good because it is so easy to get lost in Venice. I really have nothing bad to say about this hotel. The staff were very nice and helpful.

The suite was beautifully appointed, spacious enough for 4 people, although one bathroom for 4 people may become an issue after a while (we only stayed one day, so we did not care). We had a 3rd floor unit (#134) with huge wooden beams across the ceilings, which were obviously not just decorative, in fact, we later saw our room from the canal, and our windows were just underneath a tiled roof. The A/C and TVs in our unit worked well, and we placed a wake up call with no problems. Everything in the bathroom worked properly, including a nice shower with hot water and plenty, if not too much, water pressure. The only annoying thing was the folding glass partition that would not stay open on the edge of the shower and kept folding on you while you were trying to shower. Be aware that the hotel does not have access for a water taxi, so you have to haul your luggage across Piazza San Marco, or pay a porter (30E for 4 large suitecases). The hotel receptionist was pleasant enough, and arranged for a porter for us and a taxi from Piazza San Marco to take us to the airport for 125E - pricey but worth it - it took 25 min to get to the airport ... same service with Ali Laguna was $60 for 4 people but would have taken 1 hour 20 min, and they are not exactly helpful with your luggage. The receptionist provided us with a key to the front door of the hotel which they lock after 8 or 9 pm, so we could get back in. Well, at 12 midnight, we could not for the life of us unlock that door! Another couple had their own key, but were unsuccessful as well. Thank G-d, their son was sleeping inside so they called him and he came downstairs and opened up for us. Bottom Line: Great Location, Great Amenities, Be Prepared to Pay Up to Your Ears for Everything While in Venice AND Lower Your Expectations! if the A/C in your room works, it's a miracle!!!", "Date": "August 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Corpus Christi, Texas", "Title": "\u201cGood value, great location but cold showers!\u201d", "Author": "Happytraveler60927", "ReviewID": "UR115348068", "Content": "Very clean room and a little difficult to get around hotel but only major complaint is lack of hot water in evenings.

Breakfast used to be provided in the room of a self made variety which was simple but convenient if you did not want to rush out to breakfast each day but they now have it in the san marco palace restaurant which is pretty tricky to find so would recommend getting someone to actually physically show you where it is! One Flask of coffee was on the table which they periodically refill which meant every time we went down there one of us had to hand around for more coffee, rooms were adequately cleaned each day but quite often flannels etc were missing and we did not have a do not disturb sign which would have been handy due to the length of stay. on checkout due to an error they tried to overcharge us by 1100 Euros, nearly dropped from shock and was very relieved to have my paperwork on me stating the correct room rate", "Date": "August 30, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne", "Title": "\u201cLocation Location Location\u201d", "Author": "Melbournechick", "ReviewID": "UR7769833", "Content": "We stayed here recently with some family and had a fantastic time, the suites were beautiful and the staff made us feel very welcome.

It was spotlessly clean, with daily changes of both towels and bed linen. The suites are extremely private and we only saw 2 other guests during are stay. The breakfast was a continental style buffet and was very good. The short walk was not a problem at all. Reception staff were always helpful and polite, even lending us umbrellas for the day when it rained! and a travel adapter.

However, that's where it stopped. They were useless for finding info on trains, museum access or other information. The only restaurant they could recommend was their own some distance away. Room Layout: The suite we had had an upstairs room that was so warm, it was a sauna. I can't imagine what it would be like in later spring through summer. It would be unusable. As soon as you come into the room, you have stairs up and down. This would not be for everyone. We had to watch our youngest traveler closely because the floors are all hardwood and she slipped down the stairs twice.

I was a little hesitant to try this hotel since there was no feed back, but I took a chance. I'm sure glad I did!! The Location could't be better. Just under the clocktower and 2 short street on the left and your there. 1 minute walk to St. Marks Square. These are really more apartments than hotel rooms. We had a 1 bed room superior suite that had 2 wonderfully large bathrooms, one with a shower ( large) and the other with a tub/shower combination. There was a very nice living/dining room with a kitchenette which was more like a small kitchen, it had it's own room not part of the living room. The bedroom was a very nice size and the master bath was the one with with tub/shower. It was very hot when we were in Venice, the last week of June and the A/C was the best I've ever experienced in Venice. It was central A/C and we had complete control of how cold and how long we ran it. It sure felt good after coming in from a long hot/humid day. The staff could not be more helpful. We did have one small glitch when we got stuck in the elevator, but they were right on it and 15 munutes later we were saved!! Just another great story to tell!! The breakfast is basically a do it yourself affair. They provide yougurt, cereal, etc. in the refrigerator and you prepare it yourself. We never used the food supplies but chose to go to the market and buy our own Salami and Cheese, pasteries for our breakfast. Be sure to get there before 7PM as that is when the reception closes and you will have to go to the San Marcos Hotel to check in. This is not a big deal but if you came late you may think it is. Even though the reception desk is closed you can always reach someone at the desk at San Marco Hotel by phone from your room as in any hotel.
