We loved the two suites we had - one for us and one for our niece. The suites were lovely and were across a private foyer, which provided privacy and ease of getting together. Our suite was large enough for the three of us to dine (each suite had a small kitchen), visit and check email together. We also really appreciated the free wi fi, something that not even the larger hotel chains provide.

The triple room was perfect for us, as it had both a king bed and a single bed. The two beds are partially separate by a wall, which provided a nice bit of privacy and a sense of greater space. The room itself was nicely appointed, and was a good size. We easily fit three people and a lot of suitcases without tripping over one another. We had a lovely view out the window, over our narrow balcony, at the surrounding buldings and down the street. The hotel is on the corner, and the narrow side street (not Rue de l'Arcade) had a fair amount of traffic. However, traffic noise was not a problem. The AC kept the room nice and cool during the unusually hot August days while we were there. The bathroom was fairly spacious, and the room was overall clean and well-cared for. The beds were reasonably comfortable. You wouldn't confuse the hotel with a luxury five star, but it was more than comfortable enough. The staff at the hotel was friendly and helpful, including the manager Jeremy in particular. We had one issue with a rattling air conditioner, and it took the staff two tries before the problem was addressed. Overall, however, it was service with a smile and we felt well taken care of. We can't comment on the breakfast, because we choose to pick up some pastries, and some champagne and orange juice, and ate in the room while enjoying the view over the balcony. The location, as many of the other reviews have noted, is wonderful. Easy walking distance to multiple Metro stops, as well as a central location with good access to many Paris highlights in each direction. The closest Metro, at Madeliene, had three lines, making it easy to get most places with at most one transfer.

Our rooms were ready although we arrived early, but they do have a luggage drop-off if needed. Rooms are beautiful, exceptionally clean, and wi-fi is available. Beds are typical for Europe: very firm, but this is what we expected. All linens were excellent, and terry cloth towels were exchanged daily. Nice toiletries were provided.

They never hesitated to call a cab, or give advice. Exhausted after visiting the Eiffel tower and the Place de la Concorde, we ate our first evening meal in Paris at Pompeii, which is just a block away from the hotel. Surprisingly good pizza and good wine selection. Very hectic, though, with typical French wait-staff attitude, which you learn to take in stride. It is owned by an Italian family, and they are more friendly. Breakfast is really expensive at the hotel, and nothing special. We walked down the street to the patisserie for some wonderful espresso, croissants and a great view of Parisians. It is across the street from Pompeii. On our second night, we asked for a restaurant recommendation for a contemporary French meal, not an easy task for a Sunday. A half-hour later, the desk person called to say that she had made reservations for us at La Cuisine and had arranged for a taxi to pick us up.

We took a taxi from the hotel back to Gard du Nord for 5 people - 55 euros!!!!!!! The gentleman on reception was reluctant to book one for us suggesting we try the office at the end of the road - this was quickly remedied by one of the female receptionists. Nonetheless, we would recommend this hotel if you are looking for one that is is in a safe, good location with easy access to metro etc and is excellent value for the standards on offer.", "Date": "April 21, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bucharest, Romania", "Title": "\u201creasonable good , perfect as location\u201d", "Author": "deary2000", "ReviewID": "UR58012042", "Content": "We have visited this hotel at the beginning of March and we've found a beautiful small hotel located close to Madeleine Church .

One minus , instead , was the poor breakfast which considering what you can find out in other places for these money must be upgraded .

We were not disappointed. This is a lovely hotel on a quiet street just a few seconds away from La Madeleine. As everywhere is pretty flat you can easily walk down to Place De La Concorde or in the opposite direction to Galleries Lafayette. We did not feel uncomfortable or threatened at any time of day or night walking around this area. Having said that, after checking out the sites in the immediate vicinity, we spent most of our time on the other side of the Seine, visiting Notre Dame, The Pantheon, Eiffel Tower, Musee D'Orsay so just be aware that taxi fares to add up quite quickly in Paris, so plan out what you want to see and if the majority is the otherside of the river, you may want to consider somewhere over there instead depending on your budget! Here's a tip: If you call and book a taxi in Paris (even if the hotel call for you), they start the fare at a higher rate than if you flagged the taxi in the street. Generally a hailed taxi would start at 3.60 euros, however, one evening when we booked a taxi through the hotel, the fare started at 7.40 euros before we'd even gone anywhere! Just wander up to Place Madeleine and hail one there. That aside, back to the hotel. The staff were *really* helpful and friendly and gave this place a great family run feel to it. We asked for advice and to book taxis on various occasions and always found them very obliging. There's a nice foyer to sit and wait for taxis and it's all decorated to a classy, high standard. Our room was a standard double room up on the sixth floor. It was very comfortable, warm, quiet, and even had a little balcony. The bathroom was nicely decorated with a good shower and all meticulously clean. The room had a safe, but no iron/ironing board. The only downside we felt was the buffet breakfast. We thought it was quite overpriced at 13 euros per person for a very basic buffet. Unfortunately we could not find any nearby alternatives for breakfast and I think they capitalised on this a little. The juices on offer were a bit powdery and the croissants/rolls didn't seem that fresh. There was also a small platter of ham and cheese available and some fresh fruit salad, but not really worth the money. All in all we had a great time in Paris and we plan to return again. Oh, and one other tip: Pretty much all restaurants, cafes and shops close all day on a Sunday. So if you're planning on shopping, don't plan for Sunday!", "Date": "March 5, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Alassio, Italy", "Title": "\u201cGreat value and location\u201d", "Author": "Roberto_NW_Italy", "ReviewID": "UR54044255", "Content": "Location couldn't be better, a few steps from the Madeleine which means you can walk to almost anywhere in central Paris.

I hardly believe you can find a better place in that range of rate. I booked there because of previous reviews of Trip advisor, and i join the group of the members that praise about his hotel.

The room had a kitchenette in it, and so I would think it would be a perfect place to stay if you were in Paris for an extended trip.

Conveniently located during the daytime, when we wanted to go shopping, but much less interesting at night: I knew when I booked the hotel that it did not have a bar, but from previous experience in Paris I thought it would not matter, as all other areas I have stayed in in Paris have had a typically Parisian bar on every other corner.
