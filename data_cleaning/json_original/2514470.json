I wasn't looking for luxury accomodation by any means, but when you depict your rooms as being a certain way and charge $100 for it, I expect a $100 room.

She didn't know what to say to us, so we asked for the manager, to which she replied \"He is on vacation for 3 weeks\" we then said we wanted to speak to someone else then because she wasn't helping at all, she replied, \"trust me, no one cares\".

She just slopped it around in the tub and that was it the cleaning job was done. It was freezing as well, and that night I went down to ask the desk clerk to please turn the heat on. I was met with a glare so intense and so hateful I was shocked. He rudely told me that the boiler was on a timer and it would be coming on later, and then went back to fiddling with his laptop, completly ignoring me. Around 11pm the heat came on with such a commotion and clatter I thought the building was collapsing! The heat shut off again around 1am and we froze the rest of the night. The next day was Saturday, as we were staying the wekend and leaving Monday morning. I figured the young man from the night shift gone, so it would be safe to approach the front desk again, NO SUCH LUCK! He was there, he worked every shift the entire weekend that we were there, personally I think he was some kind of zombie. A very rude and unsympathetic person. Accidently Saturday evening we took the elevator to the basement, they have lockers down there, and a fuseball table. There was some beat up furniture that I was afraid to sit in and my husband told me he saw rat droppings. We met a very nice young man doing his laundry down there, he told us that he lived in the hotel, but that it was not a real hotel. The building is supposed to be used to house low income people, and some people do live there, about a dozen he said. He told us that the owners of the building are using it illegally as a hotel, since most people who would live their would pay between $100-$200 dollars per week, and they make more money by having unsuspecting tourists stay there. And sure enough we were out having brunch Sunday at a restaurant and they had a news program on there that was doing a story about illegal hotels in Manhattan. Although the report did not mention West End Studios, the reporter said that it is a big problem in the city, and that many low income people are being forced out of these places by unscruples landlords. We felt horrible about staying their, not only was the place a dump, but we were keeping a poor person from having a roof over their head. When we were checking out Monday morning I asked the girl at the desk about this, but she pretended that she didn't know what I was talking about.", "Date": "December 16, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "london", "Title": "\u201cAlcatraz style accomodation\u201d", "Author": "rossella78", "ReviewID": "UR11208939", "Content": "upon arrival the receptionist put us up to the 6th floor, an abandoned part of the buildings.

Then they maintenanced and cleaned it again that Wednesday. Note that you should bring a pair of extra flip-flops for bathroom trips, like how I used to in a college dormitory; - Our bed was ok. The white sheets didn't look super old. Though we did find a couple random strands of head and body hair on them, the sheets otherwise look clean and (more importantly) stain-free; - The pillows were probably incredibly old. The fiber stuffing inside was fairly lumpy. But at least they didn't stink; - Since our stay was during the tail end of summer, the room was sweltering, even at night. I kinda had a problem going to sleep because of how hot it got; - Lastly, the front desk clerks were not friendly, none of them. They did snappily hand me an extra bathroom towel when asked for one.

Being faced with the streets or 'The Continental' we stayed for one night only - in metal framed bunk beds - with sheets nailed to the windows and crumbling ceilings. Clearly several people lived there and every move we made was watched. The bathrooms were so filthy we refused to wash there, and moved a large dresser in front of the door to sleep!!

Room 416 avoid it at all costs. the smell coming from an excuse for a sink was unbearable and made me vomit. plaster was falling off the walls, nails sticking out all over the place, electrical cables and wires dangling from the wall where an air conditioning unit had been ripped out. so no a/c, no tv as indicated on the internet booking form, no space to leave four large suitcases, a door that was almost impossible to lock and oh if your a lady dont expect the bathroom doors to lock. oh and the grossed thing about this room was the fact that the bed sheets looked like theyd not been washed for weeks, both myself and my friend had to pick off about 40 long brunette hairs off our sheets and pillow cases. we asked for new bed sheets and still we picked off hairs from the new ones. i think the cleaner (although i never saw her) must have some malting disorder. anyway after putting up with this room for a night we managed to change room the day after. we viewed 5 rooms being shown the one on the top floor last. they were all just as bad apart from the one on the top floor which was reasonable ie didnt smell, had a/c and a tv that almost worked well. i just couldnt believe that any of the other rooms could meet trading standards. we were on holiday and had been to san fran, miami and finally new york. on student budgets this was one of cheapest we found in ny. however it was still more expensive than the other places we stayed. on arriving therefore we expecting the hostel to offer a bit more than the other cheap places we stayed. how wrong and surprised were we. it was far worse ..its not even of hostel standards, prob why they tried to call it west end studios, must be grade below a hostel or something or perhaps transalates to homeless equivalents. we were so glad to leave and i felt so sorry for new folk just arriving. please dont stay here people, this place should have gone out of business years ago. oh and top it off the lifts never work and the staircase there is steep room enough for the width of one middle sized individual and nobody to pass you coming in the opposite direction. good luck lugging your cases up and down. disgrace.", "Date": "July 27, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Murray", "Title": "\u201cWorst hotel ever ..\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3650573", "Content": "Dont EVER make the mistake of staying in this hotel. Some hotel staff are very arrogant. No phones, stinky, cramped, dusty rooms. Not all rooms have A/C, some even dont have a fan. Following is the mail I sent to Cheaptickets, awaiting a response from them. When the reservation was made on your website, the Hotel description clearly mentioned \"Air conditioning\". But on arriving at the hotel on July 2, with the temperature hovering around 90, I was given a room with NO A/C, not even a fan. I then had to literally beg the receptionist to give me a room with atleast a fan. After much haggling, I got one. I had to undergo 2 sleepless nights with the hot air from the fan blowing at me. After persistent enquiries and screaming, I got to spend the next 2 days in a room with A/C, to much relief. It apears to me that this Hotel intentionally descriminates reservations made through websites like yours, offering the worst of the rooms available, as compared to people who come directly to the hotel, check the rooms and then make the reservations. This is not fair to people who trust websites like yours and travel from far off places with the assurance that they would surely get what they reserve.

The rooms are ridiculous, it is NOTHING like the pictures advertised on the net. The rooms are insecure, the staff are rude and tried to over charge us on the last night as we were checking out. The hotel is extremely UNCLEAN, so unclean in fact that all 5 of us came out in rashes when we got back to the UK. PLEASE TO NOT STAY HERE!!!!.. it is not worth it.

My family usually stays in 4* or 5* hotels. However, I went to several places with similiar prices while I played soccer during high school. My team would stay in something like a motel 8, and though there wasn't anything impressive about it, I never felt unsafe. This pathetic place is an exception. Since our flight had problems we had to spend the night (sigh) and so this seemed like a fine option since it was just one night... Well, let me just say that doors should be able to lock, and random people shouldn't be allowed to loiter about in front of places. It's creepy and suspicious. I won't repeat how poor the rooms were, since plenty of people have, but my main point is that if you want to save money, you should not have to sacrifice safety. If people don't want to spend $200 a night on a room, then they shouldn't have to worry about anyone just walking in the room while they sleep! Trip Advisor, take this place off your list!!!! please!!! It is a disgrace! Also, there is some logic to the statement that sleeping under a bridge would be just the same as- or even better than- sleeping here. Think about it: A guy is sleeping under a bridge, and a guy is sleeping in an unlocked hotel room. Do you steal from the guy under the bridge or the guy in the hotel room? Where are you less likely to be seen? There are cars driving by to witness the theft when you're stealing from a guy under a bridge... Also, Who is more likely to have money and valuables?

What I encountered when we got there was a complete nightmare. The clerk gave us a room on the 6th floor and told us that the elevator was broken, but the repairman was on his way to fix it. Since coming home and reading these reviews I know that was a lie and that it's an on going problem that the hotel has no intention of fixing. After climbing 6 flights of stairs I noticed that the doors on the rooms didn't hang straight. Then as I opened the door to our room we nearly passed out from the stench. The sight that greeted us was of unmade beds with dirty sheets and blankets with nasty, dirty, towels laying everywhere. There were two department store shopping bags full of trash from the previous guest. What looked like pubic hairs were on the bedsheets. Black and white TV, no phone, broken air conditioner, and no working clock. I called Orbitz to complain and was told I could get another hotel on Time Square for a litte more money and when I agreed to take the room at the other hotel I was disconnected. I then called Orbitz back and got another operator who told me that the hotel I was told about did not exist. Yet Orbitz advertises that exact hotel on their website and we passed by it several times while at Time Square. Something is not right with this hotel being in business and Orbitz protecting the hotels business. I would not recommend anyone booking through Orbitz and advise staying as far away from West End Studios as possible.

I have been traveling to different places in U.S. And this hotel (should I call it a hotel?) is definitely the worst one I have ever seen before. Yes, the only good thing about this hotel is its location, nothing else. 1. The condition of the room is very bad. The room is very small (a bed takes 80% of the space). TV with limited channels without a remote controller. 2. What I reservered two twin beds room. The front desk guy gave me a room with only 1 fullsize bed. Then I went to complain. He gave me another room. ----! It's still with only one bed. 3. Then I planned to accept this. However, I found that the only blanket is very thin. Then I go downstair again to ask for an extra one. That guy asked me three times very impolite: Are you cold?? Then I told him yes. Then he went to the second floor found a blanket for me. I though he should send the blanket to my room. But he stared at me, and ask me do it myself. And then we went to the elevator, he push the button to put himself to the first floor first, and leave me in the elevator. (I need to go to 4th floor). 4. All right. The worst thing is that in the mid of the night. The heat stopped!!! And it's quite a cold day! In the morning, in the bath room (several rooms share one bath room), there was no hot water at all. 5. When I checked out, I tried to complain about the heat thing. The same guy just did not listen to me. And said that I want to make him difficulty. From 2 - 5, he nevers said \"sorry\". The worst service ever!!! I would say that never go to this place.
