The staff that I encountered was always nice and helpful. Now the bad part. The hotel looks very dilapidated. In my room, there were stains on the carpet, bedspread and decorative pillows. Pretty creepy. Also, there was a hole in the base of my shower. Its hard to imagine how I didn't flood the room below me when I showered. It was almost impossible to regulate the temp in my room until I figured out how to unlock and open the windows. And the housekeeping crew was erratic. For example, days went by and they did not replenish my toiletries or in room coffee. On my final day I stepped out of the shower to find they had not left me any bath towels!! The breakfast buffet was ok, but the neighborhood is a bit scary. Certainly would not recommend single women walking alone there at night. I know the price was not too high but by way of comparison, I stayed at a lovely Marriott resort in Scottsdale about a year ago for $20 less a night!!!!", "Date": "March 29, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego, California", "Title": "\u201cWORST Customer Service Ever\u201d", "Author": "bh_760", "ReviewID": "UR126369141", "Content": "From San Diego, California. My sisters booked 2 non smoking double queen rooms on Hotels.com for InnPlace Hotel weeks in advance for March 16th-17th, 2012 because we were visiting family to attend a college graduation in the area. InnPlace Hotel told my sisters that one of their rooms was given away at check in, they took no responsibility in their mistake and completely blamed Hotels.com. C'mon! If the hotel is overbooked! It's InnPlace Hotel's fault! They're the one who went to a third party website and said, hey, we have empty rooms, please fill them up at a discount! THEN! OMG! They tried to give my sister a King bed when she booked a room for two queen beds. How was she suppose to fit 4 adults onto 1 king bed! What kind of customer service is that!? then they said all they had was a smoking room. and my sister is a non smoker. OH! and omg, get this, the smoking room the hotel gave my sister the key to, ALREADY had people occupying the room!!! There were people's stuff all over the room! Can you TRUST a hotel who will allow access STRANGERS into your hotel room while you're out and about??? NO! Not only that but they were unapologetic! Then at the pool, unsupervised kids threw a football and hit my nephew in the eye! obviously on purpose because none of them fessed up to it and apologize. there were a lot of kids, looks like they book a lot of student athletes. hot tub was more like a warm tub with jets blowing cold water. plus, there were grown men drinking glass bottled alcoholic beverages, when there were signs posted stating it's not allowed in pool area. Hotel obviously doesn't follow their own rules because the Rude front dest guy saw the idiots drinking around the pool with kids running around barefoot, when he brought a few towels out and didn't say anything! Rude front desk guy with glasses came out to the pool to bring THREE! towels after my sister called from the room to inform the front desk that there were no more towels in the bin, which was clearly opened and you can see that there were no more pool towels! He brought only three towels! when he should have been rolling out a cart full! When I asked him for more towels, he said walking away with his back to me, someone will be out with more towels shortly. After another 30 mins, we just went in without towels. when we got to the front desk, i asked for towels and instead of just giving me some or telling me she will send towels up to the room, the front desk lady said they ran out of towels. then right after she said that, rude front desk guy comes around the corner with three towels and I said, then where did he get those? then she says, that's all they have. lol seriously? if your hotel is all booked, you should be having laundry serviced 24 hrs. Or maybe they didn't run out of towels, they are just prejudice or lazy! I ran into some white guys in the elevator who has been staying there for a week and had the same problem...sure enough I warned them to be careful that the hotel might send people to their room! lol Sure enough there weren't enough towels in the room so I went down the hall to where I saw the maid's cart. I heard maid's in the hotel room and knocked on the door to ask for towels instead of raiding her cart. She came out and asked if that room she was in was my room!? i said no, it's not, that i just want some clean towels. She grabs unfolded towels and proceed to hand them to me! i looked at her and said, oh no, i want CLEAN towels! she said they're clean that she just didn't fold them because she was in a hurry to go home! i guess!!!! when i started walking away, she asked, \"do you know if the people in this room left?\" i said, NO, i don't know those people! omg what is up with the management in this hotel!? Seriously...this hotel doesn't care about customer service, all they care about is money and they will overbook, double book, whatever just to get your money. Cost more to cancel than it does to actually stay there. There are plenty of other hotels in the same area that look better and have better prices. don't let the pics decieve you. Don't stay at InnPlace Hotel, if you do, it will be the worst experience ever that will ruin your trip and a waste a money. Only good thing was that Hotels.com did refund my sister back for the one room...but then again we booked two rooms...and could not cancel last minute without having to pay a cancellation fee so that my family could stay at the same hotel.", "Date": "March 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cedar Rapids, Iowa", "Title": "\u201cVery, Very Nice\u201d", "Author": "55Chuck1956", "ReviewID": "UR125627317", "Content": "I travel for work frequently and my wife and I travel for pleasure quite often and we will voice our opinions about lousy service or unfriendly employees.

We hurried out- saw NO employees or staff....some other guests said we can go back in, feeling unsure we did but called the front desk they said, oh yeah the elevator caught fire/broke so it triggered the alarm. YET noone called us- talked to us or let us know what was happening. When we rode the elevator yesterday our family got scared like something was wrong it creaked and crunched and thank god we were not on it when it did break!!! 10 mmins after returning to our room 6 fire trucks and an ambulance arrived, then left.

The hotel staff happily showed me an available room that was floor level with a sliding glass door that led to the outside pool and hot tub. After seeing the room and pool, I was hooked. They had just washed the carpets and were hesitant to let us have the room that night but we assured them that we would be hanging out at the pool for the rest of the afternoon so they let us have the room (room 105, two queen beds). I got an awesome AAA discounted rate by calling and making the room reservation from the hotel lobby. Cost was only $63/night. The pool was cold but it didn't make laying next to it any less enjoyable! The hot tub was awesome and both the pool and hot tub were open until 11pm. There was a also a 24 hour gym that didn't have much in it but enough to get a workout. The breakfast buffet for $8.95/per person was a pretty good deal, especially with the custom made omelets. The beds weren't the most comfortable and one of them creaked every time I turned over. The HVAC unit had a low and a high fan setting and, while it was a little on the loud sound, it worked great for me as I like to sleep with white noise in the background. The hotel is definitely dated but it is well maintained and clean; no musty or old smell like I've experienced in some old hotels. The pool is surrounded by palm trees and is very relaxing.

At the urging of our family we decided to extend our stay one more night but knew we were NOT going to do so at the Millennium. We then booked a room here. Let me tell you. If you are looking for an opulent place you basically never have to leave and focus your entire vacation around the resort... then this isnt the place for you. But if you want an amazing room with great service and an outstanding price, this is most DEFINITELY the place. We were so impressed that we even extended our stay further and stayed almost an entire week there! The front desk staff was amazing and incredibly accommodating, the rooms were clean (although carpeting could use a bit of updating) and beds very comfortable. My only complaint would be with the hot tub. It did not seem to be filled enough or by the time we got to it (we went down approximately 10 pm) the water had went down to where the jets splashed water in your face or above the waterline. Also there was a slight mildew smell to the hot tub area. Even with those \"issues\"....

The air conditioning worked but it had to be set to about 50 degrees to get the room cool in the intense Phoenix summer heat. And the TV is at an awful position, it can swivel around but it is still a bad position. Free wi-fi which works, always a plus. The beds are not comfortable at all.

There is a restaurant and bar / lounge on the premises. I ate dessert (pecan pie that was to die for!) and had drinks there. The staff was friendly and knowledgeable. It seemed everyone I spoke with there, was really enjoying their stay. One great amenity that I wasn't expecting was poolside food and drink service. After 5pm you can order food and drinks from the pool area (burger and a beer!) and charge it to your room. Such a great plus if you're weary from your day and just want to relax and not have to go anywhere. I had a chance to speak with one of the owners of the hotel who seemed very interested in the guest's viewpoint. He mentioned that they would be renovating the rooms and some of the common areas before the busy fall / winter season. All in all, I really like the hotel and would gladly recommend it to others.

We went down to the hotel resturant about 10 mins after they stopped serving breakfast, but they still served us breakfast upon our request. The hotel gives you free drink and breakfast buffett coupons to use in their resturant.

We stayed in the King Bed room and it was the most comfortable bed I have ever slept on. My boyfriend agreed! The housekeeping was great, always did a really good job at cleaning up and providing fresh towels, etc. Now for the cons: the hotel is old and I am sure that 30 years ago, this was the place to stay. The hotel does need some updating but all in all it is keep decently clean. Another downside is that the hotel does not keep up with picking up the dishes outside of hotel doors, when we would come back to the hotel room at night we would walk down the hallway and it was littered with plates, and dishes. A definate eyesore. Also, the shower was a little old and had some strange peeling on the sides of it that would rub off on your feet when you were in there. Kind of gross.

I stayed here as part of a group trip, assigned to the hotel by chance, not choice. After reading reviews here on TripAdvisor, my concern levels elevated, but it proved a pleasant stay. First impressions from the lot and outside help the hotel. The hotel keeps the lot clean, the landscaping looks nice, and the outside of the hotel looks clean. The parking lots provide ample space and the decent lighting helps you feel safer walking up to the lobby. The hotel sits within the Metrocenter shopping area--good chain restaurants such as Olive Garden and Bennigan's abound within easy walking distance, as does shopping obviously. The lobby and registration desk dress to impress--soaring open space with plant draped peek-throughs from upper floors, a large sunken pit area with lots of nice comfortable heavy leather furniture and tables, a raised area with large bookshelf spaces, tables with nice chairs, and some other furniture in small groups. Look closer, though, and you see a few problems. Two bench style seats along the railing surrounding the sunken pit area looked quite sorry--one showed multiple pulls in the fabric and both carried the crud of many years' use--large darkish areas on the arms and seats, nicks in the wood finish. They should hide these two seat benches from guests' view for now until they refurbish them. In the raised area with the bookcases, you see that the books remain only for show--mostly multivolume sets of huge outdated legal code books, with just a few novels tucked in several hundred pounds of books. Two cream-colored upholstered armchairs in the corner near the walkway to the restaurant really detracted from this area, too. They showed the grunge of several years of use, too--I wouldn't sit in one in all honesty. These two chairs should disappear from guests' view, too, until more presentable. The carpet shows a few dark stains here and there, too. The courtyard looks really nice--healthy trees illuminated at night by mini white light wrapped trunks, tile walkways--very pleasant. The pool and hot tub looked very clean. I did not partake, but I saw others enjoying these facilities. The staff at the desk proved very nice and knowledgeable. They must be under some stress with the corporate Sheraton folks constantly in and out during the refurbishment. We saw the desk staff talking with departing corporate personnel late one night while we loitered in the lobby. Maybe the staff are more relieved to finally see renovations under way, then they are stressed to have corporate in and out all of the time : ) The gift shop off the lobby proved a pleasant surprise. Tidy, neat and clean, with a nice selection of, I can't hardly believe it, reasonably priced almost to the point of saying bargain priced items. $3 dolphin figurines, $3 attractive margarita candles, floating rose candles, AZ t-shirts starting at 2/$10, and other nice items. Definitely better than many of the mall and airport souvenir shops encountered on this trip. Some of the hallways do stink. I thought it smelled like a bathroom not really clean lurking behind a door--okay, I'll say it--old urine. I am more sensitive to smells than others--many of my companions noticed nothing, but a few others thought it smelled, too. Some of the hallways show a lot of beating--big bangs out of the corners in many spots, jagged uneven ceiling cracks running the length of some hallways near one wall, a huge wooden armchair with nice upholstery but badly nicked wood sitting out of place outside the elevator, a new threshold cut and ready to install leaning against the wall, a smoke detector and trim pieces left outside a room door, plaster or some other building material marks in the carpet outside many room doors, and so on. It definitely shows evidence of serious renovations in progress, but undertaken long after needed. The hallways proved a little toasty, but the guest rooms and public rooms all remained pleasant. The room itself smelled clean and appeared clean, other than another one of those cream colored upholstered chairs identical to the two dirty ones in the lobby making its appearance in the corner of the room like a fungus growing up in a flower garden. It took a few tries to find a working light, though. Flipping the switch in the hall just inside the door produced no light. Turning on one of the lamps above the nightstands produced no light. Only after walking to the other end of the room and trying the floor lamp did a working light turn up. Good thing the hall remains well lit and that the curtains remain open to let in some of the nighttime lighting, or you might bump into several things trying to ever find a light when you first check in to your room. The comfortable king-size bed faces the large window, but remains out of view from the hall door, something I appreciate. The desk near the window has ample lighting and space to work. Two compact elegant wood nightstands flank the headboard. The sconce lamps above each nightstand beam with nice clean white fabric shades, well, that is once you call the front desk and get lightbulbs for the lamps. During the renovation, someone took them out of the lamps or never put them in there in the first place. The lady from the front desk came up herself with the bulbs promptly, put them in, and apologized. She conducted herself in a professional but friendly manner. The bathroom floor shines with great looking new marble tile. When you open the closet, however, you see bare concrete with old dried mastic compound--no tiles or covering at all. Renovation looking good here, but obviously not finished yet in this room. The strange angled low tub (or extra deep shower basin?) in a square unit looks older--the porcelain not so glossy any more, but clean. No black stuff appeared during showers as other folks reported from their stays. Water pressure and temperature ranked as good, and the toilet flushed well. The safety latch that you flip over to keep folks from entering from the hall showed signs of hasty or at least uncoordinated replacement. The flip over portion mounted on the frame hit the door about two inches above the ball portion mounted on the door, rendering it utterly useless. A renovation of this size will obviously require a lot of follow up on issues like this one. An ice run took longer than anticipated. A taped handwritten note on the fourth floor ice machine informed you it was out of order. The third floor proved interesting--obviously under serious renovation here. Buckets in the hall, plastic Big Gulp cups from workmen, the smell of adhesive compounds in the air, and an ice machine that was also out of order, but not marked. The second floor ice machine was working well and obviously new. A group dinner at the hotel for a conference turned out a mixed bag, but by far positive. The main course consisted of a fresh, tasty grilled chicken salad served in a fried tortilla bowl. The German chocolate cake for dessert, however, while it tasted okay, contained no coconut, substituted peanuts for the pecans, and other deviations--not at all what most would consider German chocolate cake. The main dish salad proved more than ample to satiate your appetite, so you didn't really need the cake anyway. In summary, would I stay here again? Yes. The staff proved excellent. The hotel facility itself was let go too long, but they are pouring a lot of money and effort into refurbishment to bring it back. I think it will be a comlpete jewel again given a few months more renovation. The rooms are clean and quiet at a decent rate.", "Date": "September 29, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Anchorage, Alaska", "Title": "\u201cNeeds Work\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3598759", "Content": "I have to agree with others.

The tile in the bathroom was dirty, the upholstered chairs in the living area were too scary to sit on, the bed linens were too thin, and the bed was extremely lumpy. Ugh! Even the mere memories of thiis room send shivers up my spine. One of the worst I've ever stayed in. We did try to \"enjoy\" the hotel's free continental breakfast that they provided (not sure if this is free for all guests or if it was part of my Starwood Preferred Gold status). At any rate, we would have done well to avoid it entirely. We both got violently ill after eating here and it took a whole day out of our vacation in Sedona to recover.

The treadmill has to be about 20 years old, and even the vinyl on the weight set was cracking. I asked them to move me to an upgraded \"business room\" after two nights, but that was exactly the same! The only difference was free internet access. I told the staff how run down the room was and they obviously had heard it many times before - they just apologized.
