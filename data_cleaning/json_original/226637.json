What a wonderful hotel. We had a queen size room with a great view (Room 301). Could the hotel use some updating? Sure, but I cant remember the last time we stayed in a place that was this clean. The staff was fantastic. When we checked in the lady at the desk was super friendly and had us checked in super fast. When I asked her about tickets to shows, she turned us on to Terry's Tickets. You call a number and talk to Terry and order your tickets at a very steep discount. You can pay over the phone with a credit card or leave cash at the front desk. The tickets then are delivered to the front desk at the hotel! He got us the best seats and even got us aisle seats which I like. The only thing that I wish they had were keyless doors on the room. They still use old fashioned keys on the plastic key ring. The hotel is right off the strip so it is very convenient but also nice and quiet. It was our first trip to Branson and we had a ball!!

The eating area was filthy, the selection poor, the cook was gross, and the food was terrible. Not a snob or trying to be rude, just calling it like I see it.

The rooms were fine and the staff were pleasant, but the pool was freezing cold and not in the best shape. The biggest disappointment was the breakfast. What a disaster! The set up is very clumsy - trying to maneuver around the tables, which were too close together to start with, was rdiculous. There was a man heating up precooked sausage and scrambled egg patties, and you had to ask what was available, which turned out to be tiny biscuits that tasted like cardboard, unsliced muffins, and some tiny donuts (these were the same ones during our four day stay - not fresh). He would also make you a waffle if you asked. There was a self-serve area with corn flakes and milk, and they had coffee, tea, and juice. The first day the \"cook\" was a young man who was obviously high on something, stumbling around behind the counter. He looked dirty and sweaty and could barely speak. After we informed the staff about him, he was removed and we didn't see him again. The owners need to visit a hotel with a real full breakfast bar, to see how it should be done.

I stayed there the weekend of May 10th 2012, and should have left after the first night. When we arrived we were put in a dirty room and had to be moved. I did notice that NONE of the regular employees were anywhere in site. I ask if there were new owners and was told no. But, everything had changed it seemed. There was a lady in the lobby (I think cleaning) with her two children with her. One being a 3 month old infant and another one approx 5 years of age. The man at the front desk could not communicate with the staff because they spoke spanish. That was a clue that things had changed as well. I have a yorkie that I keep on a (LEASH) at all times. I was chased by 3 dogs during my visit, (1) being the managers dog with (NO LEASH). The utility door was left open with tools, ladders, broom and tape in the walk way of one of the halls for over 24 hours with no one in site using them. We were kept awake 2 of the 3 nights with employees children that live on site in the rooms running up and down the concrete halls until 10:30 one night. UNTIL I CALLED THE OFFICE then it stopped. Our last night of 3 nights we were kept up again with children laughing and running up and down the halls above us and on our floor until 3:00 a.m. One of our group was sitting outside the room in a chair, enjoying the early evening having some kettle corn and 2 children of employees living on site came out of their room (which was right next to us) and litterally started grabbing at her bag of popcorn and trying to jump in her lap and would not stop. She had to get up and come in the room to get away from the two children. There was several more things that was an issue on our visit but I think this is sufficent. OH one last thing, on our exit the managers wife was at the front desk in her HOUSE ROBE, yes I said robe. I was shocked to see this in a place of business.

The drain in the sink didnt drain very fast but if you turned off the water for a few seconds it drained enough to where you could resume brushing your teeth or whatever it is you were doing. The drain in the tub didnt drain well either, we ended up having to take the drain stopper out and then it worked just worked fine. We replaced it and made sure it worked correctly before we checked out. They have a decent breakfast in the morning. They have a nice man in the breakfast area cooking eggs, sausage, and waffles in the mornings. They also have doughnuts, bagels, cereal, juice and milk. The pool area was nice and it was also clean. The hotel was pretty quiet also. I know on friday they were completely booked up and we had no complaints on noise level at all. All in all, we were very pleased with everything at Boxcar Willie's!

Size requirements (15# for Boxcar) and limitations of how many (2 at BoxW.)My dogs are a bit larger than that, but nothing unreasonable. I was traveling with my family to Branson for a family reunion. My family was staying at a hotel next door to this one, and THAT hotel had lied to me about being able to bring my pets, which i didnt find out till 4 days before i had to leave for this trip. After searching Bringfido.com and other websites, i called BoxCar. I Spoke with Mary, the awesome, polite, wonderful Property Manager, who helped me to stay near my family. She gave me a room close to the grasses for the dogs, and treated them with the Utmost respect. We were also greeted with a small squeaky toy and a gourmet treat for each dog. The motel is located off the main drag, and off to the rear of its street, making traffic very light, and still near to the bigger attractions. My only disappointment was the pool, and I don\u2019t feel this is the current owners fault, nor much they can do short of major renovation. The pool at its deepest is only 4.5 feet, it\u2019s a HUGE pool, but, very very short in depth. I found BW to be very nice. They had events, (a band played one night) I couldnt hear anything for the most part outside my room, except the occasional kid running full speed down the halls. Rooms were nicely decorated, and felt up to date. The oddest thing i noticed when i walked into my room was that.. The carpet had PADDING!? How often do you go into a budget hotel and notice a soft floor (which by the way is a sound deaden-er). The fridge was a small 1x1 Hauer Cube, and I had no microwave, which was no big deal, but would have been nice. The Beds were ULTRA comfy, i slept like a log, with the FOUR pillows per bed. Breakfast was nice, typical, of continental breakfast these days. My family all stayed at another motel which as well, used keys too, just like my hotel. I wasnt bothered by it, in fact it made my life easier, because i could just hook them to my keys and not lose them or demagnetize them all the dang time. All the pics i have seen of this PLAINLY show it is a motel, and not a hotel (hotel doors face exit into a hallway, motel doors exit to a parking lot/patio ), so please if you have confusion, then learn to do some research. My TV had 50+ channels, I\u2019m sure the previous commenter must have just had a wonky TV because i was there at the same time as them, and had no issues. All in all, my trip was satisfying and I would stay AND recommend BW to anyone.", "Date": "August 17, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Arkansas", "Title": "\u201cBoxcar Willie-ok, but probably wouldn't do it again,was turned off!\u201d", "Author": "ArkansasKatie", "ReviewID": "UR74829896", "Content": "One of the greatest challenges we face as a \"large family\" is to find appropriate lodging within budget that can accommodate all of us. We are a family of 6: my husband and I, and 4 children ages 8, 7, 3, and 2. My son is autistic with obsessive compulsive tendencies when it comes to food. He chooses to have a very limited diet which is often a challenge for us. We often look for lodging with a fridge and microwave to help accommodate what things he will eat. Not to mention my 2 year old needs a special calorie drink for nutrition purposes, so the fridge helps things stay cool. While some nice hotels in Branson such as the Clarion and Hilton do offer fridges in rooms as part of the accommodations, the max per room often makes us end up getting a 2nd room which can be too pricey and splits us up. I looked high and low for accommodations that would allow 6 per room. 2 queen beds and or a pull out sofa work for us as we have the 2 and 3 yr old who are small, with a fridge and micro. AmazINN & Suites did offer rooms with 3 queen beds in one room, but they were full. We chose the Boxcar Willie Inn. They allowed 6 per room, 2 queen beds, refrigerator and micro upon request. They also serve complimentary hot breakfast. They boast of an indoor pool and newly renovated premises. The price for 2 nights was with tax $157.something. Upon arrival, I noticed that this was a MOTEL. We usually do not stay in motels. I tried to keep an open mind. The check in room was very nice. The staff was helpful. We were given actual keys to our room. Keys, not slide cards. I guess that is what motels are like. The premises did not look junky. They have an elevator that you can use outside. They have luggage carts by the elevator. When going to our room, noticed it smelt like trash around the elevators downstairs so I was a little worried. Got to the room. Nothing fancy. It smelt really \u201ccheap\u201d, as cheap perfume trying to mask odor or cigarette smoke, not clean. (This was a non smoking room.) Inside though, looked around and it looked clean, except for mold growing on the ceiling above the shower/bathtub area. When we turned on the TV, there were only 6 channels, not premium cable. No cartoon or kids channels. This was not good for the kids. The refrigerator sat on the floor and microwave on top of that. It was all next to the sink/bathroom area which was a turn off for me and kind of grossed me out. We used the pool. Way too much chemicals. Hurt all of our eyes. I guess it did make the pool clean though. Hot tub good. They even had a sauna. I think that this MOTEL had been renovated and was really nice, but it might be going downhill and needs a good cleaning again and freshening up. The breakfast was ok, but the guy cooking did not look like he was the cleanest person to be cooking breakfast. He looked greasy. My husband saw him scratching himself a couple times and was grossed out. The floor in the breakfast room is stained carpeting and a turn off. They did offer bagels, donuts, juice, cereals, cold biscuits you must microwave, canned tropical fruit, waffle mix to make your own waffles. Meanwhile, the greasy cook heats up on a griddle, frozen sausage patties, and frozen egg patties, and will spoon gravy over your micro waved biscuits. Good things about the Boxcar Willie was that it was close to the 76 strip, quiet, not junky, catering to families, and had a coin laundry room.

They do have an elevator and since we were on the third floor it helped a ton! They even have Three (count them) ground floors which is great if your elderly or handicapped. We got one of the rooms on the back of the hotel which had an amazing view and the small electric fire place in the room added a very romantic ambiance to the setting. The beds were soft, and provided with a ton of lush pillows. It was pretty hot outside so we had the A.C working over time but it was still pretty quiet considering. The pool was VERY clean, I even saw the maintenance guy out there every day checking the levels and cleaning it. When I noticed white flecks in the pool I gathered the nerve to ask about it, turns out that was the chlorine and not some strange thing floating around. The hot tub was the perfect temperature, and we even figured out how to turn on the jets. The dry sauna was a bit difficult to figure out, but when the front desk staff saw us struggling she kindly offered her help. It does take a while to warm up (think oven) so make sure to turn it on 15 minutes at least before you want to use it. The breakfast room was pretty small, but the lobby made for a great sitting area. A gentleman even picked up playing the piano for the guests. There was a great selection of food, much better then just a roll and coffee! If you go down before 8:30 or after 9:30 it isn't as crowded and you miss most of the rush. The free wi-fi had very good speed for a free hotel internet, our computer said it was a soild 3g for the time we stayed. This is a fantastic hotel for families and romantic getaways a like!

We stayed here 3 days 2 nights, last weekend before school started. When we got there, it was late because of all the traffic- do your research and get a map before you go, take the back roads since this hotel is located on the opposite end of the strip from where you get off the highway. It took us over 2 hrs to drive two miles because of the traffic. It was bad. There was no parking, but I get it, we were late getting there. We had to haul our luggage uphill from the opposite end of the hotel to get to the room. There are not enough stairs to get to the upper levels here, so if you are elderly, or have any kind of problem, or alot of luggage and kids, your in for a walk. We actually dropped our luggage off the railing while one of us caught it, because it was too far to haul it back to the car. The room was pretty large, no complaints, freezing cold air was a plus! Free wi-fi!! Beds were okay. My husbands back was killing him on the last day, but I was fine. I don't think you ever sleep that great away from home anyway. The breakfast, was laid out poorly, you couldn't get into this tiny room to have a folding table and a few things on it, and some bagels and biscuits jammed in the back corner next to an emergency exit door . A worker was trying his best to cook on a hot plate, sausage and eggs, again, he was squished back in the corner. The food wasn't bad, you just couldn't get in and out of this tiny room, with the long line of people waiting to get in there. They really need to rethink this, it took forever to get your food. We had kids waiting, as well as, everyone else. They had enough seating, out in the lobby. Maybe not so crowded in off season. The staff was very nice, no complaints- The pool....dissappointment. We went for the pool so the kids could swim. It was NOT clean. There was mystery things floating in it, my husband was really grossed out, and he and the kids only swam one time for one hour. We got the net and fished some of mystery stuff out ourselves. The water wasn't clean and it smelled. My son had goggles, but the other kids( not our kids) in the pool said the water was really burning their eyes. The pool is VERY shallow 3ft on one end and maybe 4ft. on the other. Good for young children not for adults, too shallow. If you are going for a clean room, I recommend.

My husband and 12 year old son were happy with me for finding this motel. The lobby was very nice, with a large screen HDTV and two comfortable couches. Check in was quick and friendly. The indoor pool area was very clean. The deepest part of the indoor pool is only 4 1/2 feet deep, as a warning for those who prefer a pool with a deeper deep end. The pool water was cold, probably because the weather was cool this weekend. The pool floor is made of ceramic tiles and is slippery, so I would suggest wearing swimming shoes. The hot tub was very nice, though. I didn't try the sauna. Pool towels are provided by the hotel, so you don't have to bring your own. The room was very clean. The large 6 drawer dresser was great; usually, you only get a dresser with three drawers. There was a 27\" TV. There was a mini fridge, a coffee maker (with coffee packages, tea packages and creamer and sugar provided) and a blow dryer. There were lots of towels. A nice 3 drawer nightstand was located between the beds. The beds weren't as comfortable as advertised, although to be fair, I have a hard time sleeping in beds that are not my own. The breakfast provided was very nice. There was cereal, bagels, donuts, and cinnamon rolls. You could also make your own Belgian waffle and get a hot breakfast sandwich (precooked sausage and scrambled eggs on an English muffin. There was also biscuits and gravy. For drinks, there was apple and orange juice, coffee and milk. What was especially nice was that all the buildings are connected by covered walkways. This is especially nice if it was raining and you needed to get to the lobby. There is an elevator to all floors and there are nice carts you can use to get your belongings to and from your room. There are ice machines and soda machines on every floor. We were in room 204 at the back of the hotel (towards Table Rock) and the view of all the trees and mountains was gorgeous. We could sit on the balcony chairs and enjoy the view. There is also a nice sun deck outside the building that the indoor pool was in.
