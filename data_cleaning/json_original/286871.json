However, we were really pleasantly surprised by what we experienced. The hotel is only a 5-10 minute walk from the Furio Camillio metro station. The area isn't rough or dangerous, it's just not as attractive as the middle of Rome - mainly because it is a residential area. Neither of us ever felt in danger or uneasy, even walking back at 8pm in the darkness. The room was large, with aircon, balcony and a nice clean bathroom. The \"double\" bed was actually two single mattresses pushed together with one sheet put over the top but it never really caused any problems for us. It was comfortable and we slept well. As some others have noted, the breakfast is a little sparse in its options, but the food that is available is quite nice. If you aren't impressed, there's a Carrefour market 2 minutes away. The room must be quite nice in summer when they open the windows etc. The receptionist was helpful, allowing us to store our bags for free on our last day whilst we went for a bit of souvenir shopping/sight seeing. There's also a single computer for quickly checking emails etc for free, and Wifi is available through a hotspot (\u20ac6 for 3 hours if I remember correctly?).

The location of the hotel is not central, (probably that's why it is cheaper) but it's not in the suburbs, and it is very easy to reach there: 10 minutes walk to metro station (Furio Camillo - 6 stations away from the Termini railway station) or there's a bus stop right next to the hotel (bus line 628), which takes you to Piazza Venezia and further. There's a supermarket, bread shop and a special italian food-shop near. The hotel itself may not be 4-star, but they are certainly trying. The room is cleaned every day, the towels are changed every day. The bath tube was a bit moldy, but it was clean anyway. (I always bring cleaning tissues with me and do the cleaning myself, but there was not much to do there actually... :-) The room was spacious and comfortable, it was overlooking the huge park in front of the building.

The breakfast was buffet-type, it was correct, maybe not that wide variety (one type of ham, cheese, bread, croissant, butter, boiled eggs, jam, yoghurt, coffee, tea, milk) but you can eat as much as you want to. The staff was ok, however we didn't need too much help, but they can help you for sure, they speak good English.

All in all: if you have luxury needs, this may not be the perfect one for you, but if you want to stay in a nice, clean, modern hotel for your sigthseeing trip, then I really recommend it, because the price is much more lower than the hotels in the central with much worse quality!!!", "Date": "October 2, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "WA", "Title": "\u201cGood hotel\u201d", "Author": "Pip182", "ReviewID": "UR24519168", "Content": "We stayed here on Contiki tour.

When we first arrived around 11:30am, Francesca at the front desk gave one of our friends his room key, but told my boyfriend and me that our room was not ready and we would have to wait for about an hour to get our hotel room. We asked her if she could just put us in a room that was ready and she rolled her eyes and said that it would not be a long wait as it will be ready in about 15 minutes. After 30 minutes went by, I asked her if the room was ready as more than 15 minutes went by, and she told us that it would be another 5 minutes. Long story short, she scolded me after asking her the 3rd time and said, \"This is Italy, we do things differently here than America.\" And finally, after waiting an hour and a half, we were given our room key for room #101. Our hotel room was horrible: stains in the lamp shades, stains in the carpet, mold in the shower, open windows where you can hear all the cars go by on the street, it was hot in the room and the AC unit was not working, and there was a large dent in the middle of one of the beds, and a small dent in the second bed. When I told Francesca about the dents, she said someone will be at my room to fix the problem. The maintenance guy brought in a wooden plank to put under the matress. This did make the dent seem smaller, but the mattress was horribly dented itself and a wooden plank was not going to fix it. After much begging to switch rooms, and some muttered Italian from the maid and Francesca, they switched us to room 201 (right above the old room). The beds in 201 did not have dents and the air conditioning was working, but the toilet seat was cracked, shower had mold, and there were stains on the carpet, walls, and lamp shades as well. This hotel also has a bad location. It was a hike uphill to get to the Metro. Someone who wrote a review said it is a 10 minute walk... however, I walk fast and it took at least 16 minutes to get there. Once you are at the station, it takes about another 20 minutes train ride to get to places of interest in Rome. With so much to see in Rome, if it is your first time to see the city, it is well worth it to stay closer to the city center. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone! I don't know how this hotel got 4 stars (maybe there are some rooms that have been better kept ~ one out of our many Contiki travel friends liked her room), but it was definitely not deserving of any stars with its bad location, rooms in bad condition, and rude service from Francesca (at the front desk).

I will be honest, if you are not on a budget or are looking for a 'lovely' hotel, then this hotel probably isn't for you but as a young couple wanting an inexpensive trip, it suited us fine - don't expect too much though. Firstly, we got a taxi from the airport (Ciampino) which cost us 50Euro. We did feel that this was expensive as it wasn't a long journey but apparently that is what is expected. The hotel is in a slightly run down area but i didn't feel it necessary to spend time there as we were staying at the hotel as it was cheaper than the city centre ones. It felt perfectly safe. The hotel itself was pleasant. It was in need of a lick of paint etc but if you're not planning on spending that long in the hotel, i don't see the problem. The bed was comfy, the shower was great and the staff were friendly and helpful. I wasn't too impressed with the breakfast mind - tinned fruit and watered down juice (there were other options but i'm not a great breakfast person myself). On the Saturday, we caught the bus into the centre which was a bit confusing and took about 25-30 mins (bus stop 1 min from hotel). Firstly, you have to book tickets in a newsagents (REMEMBER: buy Sunday tickets beforehand as the newsagents are not always open - recommend buying in bulk). We didn't find it very clear where to get off the bus but a kind man helped us on our way. On the Sunday, we caught the tube (as we didn't have bus tickets). The hotel staff told us that they would not recommend walking to the tube station as it is uphill but i disagree completely. It was a 5-10 minute walk on a small hill. If you are healthy, it is not a problem at all. I preferred catching the tube, i found it more relaxed than the bus.

None the less we thought we would give it the benefit of the doubt. The security was excellent but I was very concerned as to why the owners had gone to such extremes to protect the hotel. Even so, this must be seen as a positive on their part. The hotel lobby was quite stylish, however the bar consisted of three stalls and was only manned if the receptionist was free, otherwise forget it. When arriving in our rooms we found them to be clean. The shower was a little mouldy but I have seen worse. You cannot fault the work of the maids as they ensured the room was spotless every day. We were quite disappointed to see no tea or coffee making facilities but put that down to a cultural difference. We were astounded, however, to see two cooking hobs yet no utensils or pans to actually cook with! There was a fridge which was partially stocked and a mini-safe. The room came equiped with Sky TV which was extremly useful during the recent terrorist scare which occured on our last day. The staff at the hotel could not be bothered to help us at all. One such example is when we needed to borrow an iron. We were told that the hotel only had one and it had already been borrowed by another room. If we wanted it, we had to knock and ask for it ourselves. On our first night we were tired and hungry and just wanted a pizza delivered to our room (there was no where to go nearby and no food is served other than at breakfast time). The receptionist was less than helpful and we struggled for 20 minutes to be understood by the pizza parlour. By the end of the trip I made a point of not even speaking to the Receptionist staff. From the moment we arrived we felt as though we had offended them in some way and that they couldn't be bothered with us so I made a point of not going to them for anything. The breakfast room was ok but very hot in the mornings. It was more on par with 2* then 4*, to be honest. The location was poor, there is no basic welcome information in the room other than a poor marketing leaflet and the reception staff try to push an excursion brochure on you from the moment you enter, which is extremly expensive.

We were booked in for 3 nights but ended up leaving after just 1. We started in room 104 which at best was 2* star quality. It was a reasonable size but was not in good condition. This included blue ink stains spattered up one wall and two cooking rings in one of the cupboards (!!) in addition to wires hanging down from the top. Furthermore the walls were thin - I could hear the guy in the next room shaving in the morning - and our room was at the back looking straight onto the road. Apart from a lumpy bed it was the traffic zooming past all night that kept me awake. The main reason we left though is that my wife is sensitive to dust and within minutes of walking into the room she had a streaming nose and a tight chest. I asked to move rooms but the hotel was full the first night - the staff advised me to check again the next day. On doing this they showed us a room around the corner at the front of the hotel which was nicer. The room had wood laminate rather than carpet - which cut down on the dust and was in better decorative condition at least - probably closer to 3* in quality. It also had a view across the green fields in front of the hotel. By this stage however they had started repainting the main lobby which added paint fumes to the mix. So having weighed it all up and given that we were in Rome for a holiday we decided to cut our losses and move location. Obviously this hotel has some nicer rooms and some not very good rooms and unless you can get one of the better ones you will probably not want to stay here.

All built ins were hidden by cabinet doors. Our private bath included a bidet and shower (no tub). Bath towels were large and thick. We saw men repairing the air conditioning system which was not working our entire 7 day stay. Bedroom windows opened but you could latch the shutters over the open windows for privacy and safety. The elevator was small but adequate for two people and luggage. Breakfast buffets included ham, cheese, hardboiled eggs along with the usual juices, cereals, fruits. and rolls.

There is a grocery store a couple blocks from the hotel where you can also buy beer and wine. Yes, the location isn't the greatest but very managable and safe. Two different bus lines can be caught around the corner from the hotel (bus stop called Macedoni), avoiding a 20 minute uphill walk to the nearest Metro (subway) stop which is Furio Camillo.

The area around the hotel is bad. True, you can take the metro right into the city . . .but why? Why do all that hassle when you can be right in Rome? From this hotel, it is a 10 minute (confusing) walk to the metro, and then another 5 stops at least to any attractions. And if you want to stay out at night, you cannot take the metro back to the hotel, so you will pay $$ for the taxi. If you are trying to save money, consider the transportation costs involved. You will probably make it up. How can you enjoy Rome when you have to make your way back to the boonies at night to sleep? Go to Rome and stay in Rome. I was on a tour, so I had no choice for the hotel, but after my stay here, I then switched hotels, for the same price, to a hotel within walking distance to trevi fountain, spanish steps, etc, etc, and it was just as nice (Hotel Embassy). I would not recommend this hotel to anyone.", "Date": "October 18, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, UK", "Title": "\u201cTurn down the neighbours!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2618495", "Content": "This hotel comes no where near the 4 star rating it has. There was a mini bar (with 2 cans of sprite inside!), the cooked breakfast promised, turned out to be a substandard continental breakfast with the worst coffee I have ever had and tepid water should you want to attempt tea instead. We went in october which was hot during the day and cold at night, the air conditioning didnt work which meant opening the window. This was an extremely noisy option. The locals seem to have no regard for any neighbours and we once woke to find our selves breathing in petrol fumes from the Italian equivelant of a boyracer/Chav meeting just outside! When it did turn cold there was nothing more than a sheet and a very thin bed spread to keep us warm. There are no tea/coffee making facilities in the rooms. And even though you might think that the San Giovanni area is quite close to the centre its bigger than you think. The nearest tube is Camillo Fumillo (do not let the stupid Tourist information guides tell you San Giovanni), and even then its a 10 min walk and not that pleasant at night. The give away that the area is a problem is compounded by the fact that you might mistake the hotel for a high security prison. My tip...If you can afford to, stay somewhere else.", "Date": "October 4, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Glasgow", "Title": "\u201cAgreed, Nice Hotel, Bad Location\u201d", "Author": "Coonometer", "ReviewID": "UR2578102", "Content": "The hotel was ok, I definitely do not agree with a 4 star rating as some of the carpets were stained and dirty.
