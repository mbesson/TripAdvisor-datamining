Some complain that it's noisy but when you choose an hotel located at Istanbul's equivalent of NYC's Times Square area, who's to blame? The hotel or the person who actually decided to rent there??? In this city of 14 million people, the hotel is located right in the heart of the city's nightlife area, everywhere in the city is much calmer. The hotel staff is friendly, the rooms are bright and clean, internet is free, fast and always on, the hotel is safe (left money, my laptop, a tablet, a camera and a phone in the room and no one ever touched it in the 5 days I stayed there). I almost only have good things to say and will definitely go back to this hotel at the time of my next visit. Everything was perfect except the following: - Breakfast is the same every morning (waitress is very nice) - A friend of mine called 4 times and talked in Turkish with the front desk staff, he left messages for me each time to the employees but nobody ever transmitted his messages to me nor notified me of a message. - Although there is absolutely no dust in the room of in the bathroom, accumulated dirt on the white ceramic floor of the bathroom made the tiles go dark gray all along the walls. It would need to be scrubed thoroughly. - Single room is 110 Euro directly with them and $110 USD on Expedia but if you buy from Expedia you get room on noisier first floor.... They keep the higher floors for people who pay more, even when the hotel is not even half full. Well insulated so not bad anyway.", "Date": "April 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "rome", "Title": "\u201cwhat a pity: cosy but very very noisy\u201d", "Author": "fabio042", "ReviewID": "UR128212080", "Content": "The odda hotel is really a very nice place with its old charming atmosphere, good stilish furniture, well equipped rooms and, first of all, a quite efficient service.

We reserved a suite & were \"confirmed\" a suite, but was taken to a room- called the front desk- said they made a mistake & that we would be switched \"tomorrow\". Ok- we were tired & settled in. It was pretty warm- no A/C- the night manager said it would be turned on \"tomorrow\"....... He said \"open the window\" UH- let me explain the area..... There are NUMEROUS night clubs/bars downstairs from the hotel with music PUMPING (the bars close between 3-4AM)- this is one of the party areas of the city- I think this is what it would be like staying ON Bourbon St. in New Orleans during Mardi Gras..... Yes- its that loud...... SO- since we werent going to be going to bed very soon- we decided to pop open some wine...... no corkscrew in the room, or wine glasses- called the night manager again- he would have them sent up with some ice- arrived quickly from the expressionless bellhop who commented that he wanted a tip...... LOL!!! So to recap- we didnt get our confirmed suite, there was no A/C, its VERY loud @ night- not the greatest start. So- the next day- we didnt fully unpack since we were going to be moved- went out & about for most of the day came back to be told- we would not be moving....... GRRRRR!!!! \"Tomorrow\" we were told....... they said we would not be charged the suite price- so they made it right. Still no A/C- we were given some reason about they didnt use enough heat over the winter & they have to wait or something- I still dont know...... Maybe \"tomorrow\"???? Although- we were thinking being up on the 6th floor we were farther away from the night club thumping going on downstairs. Anyway, enough about our issues. Hotel was clean, rooms nice, comfy beds, nice linens, nice pillows, free WIFI throughout the hotel. Bathrooms could have been a little cleaner- porcelain sinks should shine!!! And the water glass on the sink should also be clean.... Bathrooms dont have much room for a toiletry kit to put anywhere- so we had to keep our toiletries out on the desk in the room. Good showers though- nice water pressure. Soaps & shampoos were alright- nothing fancy. Suggest you bring your own bar soap though- the soap you get there is nice but pretty small. Breakfast was adequate, assortment of meats & cheeses, juices & coffee- a strange breakfast room though- the layout..... Nicely decorated though & fine. We were moved to our suite for our last night & it was nice- on a lower floor closer to the clubs- but the windows closed do cut down on the outside noise- so you have to decide- noise or temperature.......???? We chose the temp & just flung them all open since we were going to be up- after all we got back @ about 2AM- nice cross breeze. Room could have used some touches though- like a dimmer switch for the light- this was a beacon!!!! Strange that the shower was IN the bedroom...... Dont get me wrong- the area out side the hotel is great if you are into that sort of thing- & we are- but to stay in the middle of it- not so much. Doesnt make for great nights sleep if you want to get up early in the AM to go exploring....... We did notice there werent many residential apartments in this area- all the other buildings around the Odda were dark- the only ones with lights on were hotel's or guesthouses. Great bars & restaurants right outside the door of the hotel & its very centrally located- easy access to taxis & the main shopping street it about a 5 min walk away- Taksim Sq. is about a 10 min walk as well. Given our \"hotel challenges\", Istanbul is a FANTASTIC city- we cant wait to go back but would certainly stay a quieter area & perhaps a more \"established\" hotel that doesnt keep telling their guests \"tomorrow\"......", "Date": "April 12, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Istanbul, Turkey", "Title": "\u201cThe best!!!\u201d", "Author": "siyosh", "ReviewID": "UR125401938", "Content": "The greatest Hotel in Istanbul.

Later on he introduced me to the staff and they explained everything I had available. Entering the room, it was clean and perfectly designed. The bathroom is also spacious and very clean. The bed was one thing that if I could take her home, I would have done. Hard in the right places and comfortable....

Only days before my departure I found the ODDA Hotel and booked it for half the cost of the popular hotels. ODDA is a brand new boutique hotel in the heart of Taksim near the shopping, restaurants, and nightlife and only about a 30 minute walk to the historic side for sightseeing (or 10 minutes by metro). I figured that since it was new it would be clean and it was indeed very clean. My only concern was knowing it's location in the heart of the \"action\" there would be noise from the bars and clubs, but when I closed my balcony door and windows the thick sound proof glass completely sealed out the noise for almost complete silence. I was amazed! Some evenings it was nice to have the windows open to hear the hustle and bustle of exciting Taksim while I was unwinding or getting ready to go out, but when I was ready to go to sleep I just closed the windows for peace and quiet. The staff at the ODDA were all very friendly and hospitable and most speak english too. The breakfast, which was included every morning was terrific, featuring cereals and breads, baked treats, and meats and cheeses and olives as well. There really isn't anything negative I have to say about the hotel, it's charming and cute.
