The place is in need of some updating and deep cleaning of carpets. The staff at check-in lied to us. We had requested a townhouse unit and had called them six months before arrival, then three months before arrival and then two weeks before arrival and every thime they said we could have it. The day of check in we called to say we were running late and they did not say anything to us that we could not have the townhouse unit. At check-in, they told us two units had plumbing problems and that they needed to be further evaluated and would be available to us on Monday and that we could move to either one of the units on Monday. Amy and Danielle in the front office did not know what the problem was and would not tell us what was wrong with the units. We planned our visits around Orlando around this information and on Monday when we called to move, they basically told us that they were not going to move us. The two units that had \"plumbing\" problems were both occupied by ohter families. By the way, we never saw any plumbers work on either unit. The staff did not care that we had contacted them six months, three months and two weeks prior to our arrival and how important the layout and location of the townhouse were to us. Every time we called they would say that they had \"plenty\" of townhouses available. What we think happened was that we booked our vacation through travel zoo for $28.00 a night, which is a steal for Orlando. We reserved through Wyndham Vacation Club on a special they had. When Florida Vacation Villas realized what we were paying, they refused to accomodate any request we had simply because they were making little money on us. If you are looking for a place to stay in Orlando and have to make a decision between Florida Vacation Villas and another location, I would choose the other location. We live in Tampa, FL and will certainly consider staying at this location again but if another location is equal, we will probably choose that location.", "Date": "March 24, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "texas", "Title": "\u201cIf you want a good location and not mind that it's basically a motel with kitchen\u201d", "Author": "mv49", "ReviewID": "UR125234435", "Content": "we didnt realize that there is a major difference what side of the street you get. we were across from the main part of the FVV's. we had a two bedroom condo which felt like a cheap motel with kitchen. there was food encrusted on some of the plates this never happened in our 25+ years of timeshare exchanges. everything was OK slightly dated and weird floorplan. noise carried easily. heard whenever the neighbors were showering because of loud fans and poor insulation same with dishwasher. couldnt get AC temperature below 76 even after we called. best thing about this place is LOCATION. 10 min to Disney etc so you dont have too much driving, near Publix and Walmart too. if you want a good location and will be out most of the time this could be a good place to stay. it was quiet in the evenings and felt safe. but we mostly just slept there.", "Date": "February 26, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "bethel heights", "Title": "\u201cVery Comfortable and Location is great\u201d", "Author": "jeffhutcheson", "ReviewID": "UR124901519", "Content": "We are owners of this time share, yet never seen it before.

I called a few weeks before we arrived to let them know we'd be coming in late Saturday night (thanks to reviews that told us their office is closed in the evenings so we could ask how do the late check-in). I got the info I needed from Amy, and I asked if we could be placed in a unit in the main section, not in the section across the street (thanks again to other reviewers about this info!). Amy confirmed we were indeed going to be in the main section. When we finally arrived after being stuck in heinous Orlando traffic, we were rather upset to learn we were in a villa across the street. There was nothing we could do about it at 10 pm, so we went to our villa. It was nicely appointed and spacious, with the master bedroom having one full wall of closets. The kitchen was small with little counter space, though. There was a flat-screen TV in the living room but older TVs in the bedrooms. The stove was an electric coil stove and the dishwasher was an old one that my parents had back in the 80s!! There was a nice gazebo with a patio table and four chairs in front of our unit, and the back patio faced a nice, grassy courtyard with a raised patio and another table and chair set. There was a small pool behind the units and a tennis court, along with laundry facility. We decided to make the best of it and decide the next day whether to see if we could be moved to the main section. By Sunday morning, we had uncovered NUMEROUS maintenance issues, and we spent the first half of the day with the maintenance man going in and out as he fixed one toilet, replaced the DVD player (broken remote), swapped batteries in the smoke detectors (one was beeping when we got in and the lights were out in all the others and likely dead), got the patio screen door back on the track, and tightened the wiggly toilet seat on the other toilet. The reception on the TV in the master bedroom was terrible. Once everything was fixed, we felt better about staying in there, but then the people above us came back from their day or checked in and literally were stomping around and letting their children run around. I finally called upstairs to let them know we could hear everything, and to my surprise, the women was very polite and agreed to keep it down. Dead silence for hours, and then they came back again at 11:30 pm. For an hour we endured major stomping around, the very loud and rapid squealing of the bed frame above our boys' bedroom (it kept them awake) and then the sound of a long shower (the roar of the water in the pipes was incredibly loud). That was enough for us. First thing Monday morning, we called and spoke to Danielle (Jay, the marketing guy who comes in on Sundays, does not have the authority to do room changes) and she immediately said she'd move us. So we spent Monday morning packing up and moving. At first glance, the new unit seemed fine, just seriously dated and in need of new counters, cabinets, and flooring (the carpet was torn in the bedroom, and several tiles were chipped, broken or scratched). But that night, we discovered that the master bath shower didn't work right: the temperature dial just spun and spun, so my husband got a lukewarm shower. Our king mattress was so old, that just sitting on the edge of the bed made the springs squeak. It was also sunken in on one side, so I slept in the middle. The headboard was not attached to anything and smacked the wall if we so much as turned over, so we had to pull the bed out. By the following day, it looked like it was going to collapse on us, so we used the nightstands to hold it in place. We called about the shower, but no one came on Tuesday, so we had to call again Wednesday morning (all five of us had to use one shower). When we got back to the room Tuesday night, we discovered water under the kitchen sink and in the dishwasher, which we hadn't run. Maintenance took care of both issues on Wednesday and then ran the dishwasher for us (very nice!). We were also pleasantly surprised to find a pumpkin pie on the counter, from the staff to help us celebrate Thanksgiving. The staff really does do their best; this place just needs an overhaul. In the main section of the villas (I hesitate to call this a resort, because that evokes an image of one of the amazing Marriott timeshare resorts we've been to), there is a larger pool, a hot tub, an outdoor pool table and a game room. We had wanted to be near all of that, and we were glad once we were so the kids could just walk out the patio door and go hang out without our needing to be there too the entire time. They were in the pool every night after we got back from the parks and had a great time (although they said the water in the hot tub looked yellow one night!! Gross.). The outdoor pool table and virtually all of the gaming tables in the game room are in need of replacement. The outdoor table has a tear in the fabric, but that didn't stop our enjoyment for a casual game. You have to ask for the cues and balls from maintenance if the office is closed. Luckily, Ken was walking by and brought them out for us. The pool table in the game room is so worn the metal is showing on the edges of the pockets. The air hockey table surface was smashed in on one side, as if someone nailed it with a pool cue. The foosball table had a broken attachment for one of the bars, and the tabletop shuffleboard surface was chipped. There was no water fountain, which would have been handy. My husband and boys went into the game room once and never went back. The on-site laundry consists of a couple of laundry rooms with coin-operated washers and dryers, but no change machines. It took two attempts to get our clothes dry the first time (you cannot choose the time; it's pre-set). No baskets were provided. We won't stay in another apartment-style resort without laundry in the unit again; it is FAR easier when it's in your unit and you don't have to forage for coins. It supposedly gets locked up at 10 pm but we were in there until 11 twice and it wasn't locked up (you use your room key to get in). I believe the reviewers who gave this property a 5-star review must have either been in refurbished units or just don't care about run-down units that have maintenance issues. We are pretty tolerant people and managed to enjoy ourselves anyway, and we appreciated the staff. We gave one star for them and one for the pool area, but we'd never stay here again. We have stayed in several timeshare resorts, with only the Marriott one being exemplary (RCI properties are too often run-down like this one), and we will stick with the Marriott. We don't mind older units, but we do mind run-down accommodations. Had we paid for this on a nightly basis, we would have checked out on Tuesday and stayed somewhere else.", "Date": "November 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Windsor, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGreat Disney Area Experience\u201d", "Author": "jfarlam", "ReviewID": "UR119998203", "Content": "I recently stayed at Florida Vacation Villas, a timeshare with rentals less than 10 minutes from Disney.

We have stayed in a few different ones through our years of going to Orlando for vacation. Check-in: Staff is very friendly and helpful and does go the extra mile to keep guests happy. There is also a number to call during off-hours if you need help. We found this out AFTER we needed them and didn't see the sign, but for future visits we now know to call. We have only had a problem once in our 5 stays but Monday morning they let us change units. Pluses: 1. The units now have wi-fit which we are very happy about! In the past, we had to go over to the game room to get internet, but now we can get it in our unit which is a huge plus for us. 2. There is a game room with a pool table in it. We used it some. We have used the pool and the hot tub in the past, although for our December trip we did not. 3. The front office does have coffee and sweet rolls every morning if one is interested. Units: There are several different types of units at this location. We prefer the units directly across from the main office as they are two story and so you don\u2019t need to worry about bothering folks below you or having to hear folks above you. I am told these are harder to get during peak season, but we normally travel off season when they don\u2019t have the units fully occupied. We have stayed in one of the 3 bedroom units in the main building, but we didn\u2019t like these nearly as much. The layout is awkward and the kitchen seemed much smaller. However, it is nice to have these available for families who might need them. Minuses: No really big complaints.

The unit fine for the most part - some updating had been done... However, when I called to confirm my reservations the week before I was assured that we would be able to swim in a HEATED pool. Monday evening my family and I tried to swim, but the water temperature simply wasn't warm enough for an evening swim. I called the following day to ask if the temperature could be adjusted. The front desk clerk informed me that it would take a few days to heat and asked if I was staying for one or two weeks. I told her one and she said that it probably wouldn't be heated enough to swim in before I left. I found the staff glossing over problems like this constantly. I was told that Guest Services would be open on Sunday. It wasn't. The facility is not manned 24/7, so if you have any problems or questions you have to wait until normal business hours. Checking in and out early or late is not especially convenient. They advertise WIFI, but it is only in the Guest Services area. The staff did inform me that if I wanted to use the Internet in the evening that I could sit on a bench outside of the office and my laptop could probably pick up the signal. Great. You also have to take out your own trash, which is located at the very back of the property behind some buildings - we had to put the trash in the car and drive it. The tour that they offer should be avoided at all costs!! It is a scam with pushy, rude salespersons. We were there for over 3 hours!! I filed a written complaint that was over 2 pages long.

The bathrooms were fine. My only complaint was that the soap dispenser in the master shower is mounted in an awkward spot and I kept bumping my shoulder on it and since we stayed during Thanksgiving week, we only got to exchange towels once during the week and I ended up buying some extras on Thanksgiving day. There is a small pool and playground located behind the building we were in, but the better pool with the hot tub is across the street along with the pool table and game room. We enjoyed the free Krispy Kreme donuts and coffee in the office each morning. We were only asked once if we wanted to do the \"tour\" of another property and when we declined we weren't pressured or pestered again. The staff gave us a pumpkin pie which we enjoyed after our Thanksgiving dinner.

The tub faucets were missing parts. The tub could not hold water, and the tub faucets was not working. The shower door was something else!!! Just plain disgusting!!

If we could, we would have gone to another hotel but it was too late since we would have lost the $350 deposits.

The shower doors were broke and very hard to push back and forth, and it looked as if they had never been cleaned. There was alot of mold and mildew, which I scrubbed with Clorox and a toothbrush.
