I had never stayed at a Pan Pacific, specifically, but the name took me back, as I'm familiar with the hotel (having been inside) in Singapore. This hotel was like visiting those Asian hotels again. Came up with my wife for a conference. We stayed in a king that had a city view. The location is wonderful. It's right on the harbor and, if you don't get the harbor view, the lounge has big windows that face it. It's a sprawling business hotel, with a ground floor entrance and a lobby/check-in desk two floors up. There's an entrance to the Waterfront SkyTrain station practically out the front door. The room was large. It featured a king bed, a flat-screen TV, a desk, a very large bathroom, a pull-out sofa, and a chair and chaise lounge that faced the large windows. Everything was clean, well-appointed and exactly what I became used to in staying in hotels of similar quality in Asia but so rarely seen in the Americas. I was impressed with the quality of the room and furnishings. I was also impressed with the efficiency of the elevators. I think these are the most efficient I've seen in any high-rise hotel in the world. My nit-picks are really minor, but it's a 4.5-star, so I have to point them out. - When we checked in, we were asked if we wanted a newspaper. We said no but, on that first morning, I opened the door to a newspaper outside. There was no newspaper the subsequent days though. - There was a note on the desk in the room that mentioned the windows of the hotel were being cleaned. The time span given was roughly two weeks with no specifics on where they would be, so we had to be careful about leaving our shades open. I also didn't notice this note until the second day there. It seems like it would have been a good thing to mention upon check-in. - I had consistent problems with the keycard. Instead of inserting the key, you tapped against the door. Maybe it was a matter of my inexperience with this type of keycard, but it always took me several tries to get the door to open. If you're staying Downtown though, then this should be a top choice. It's location relative to the convention center, with its own walkway to it, is ideal if you're in town for a conference.", "Date": "April 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brampton, Canada", "Title": "\u201cNot complaints but nothing to write home about\u201d", "Author": "jaipaulmasseysingh", "ReviewID": "UR128282085", "Content": "Stayed for two nights for business.

Some minor service glitches bothered me, like not having the final checkout bill under my door on the final morning, it would have made my checkout quicker.

The view from our room of Stanley Park was incredible. The staff were friendly. We ordered room service - two meals, no alcohol: $119.

The Congress Centre (which was built ahead of the Olympics 2010) is situated next to the hotel, and is really a nice, modern architectonical building. Our room was, of course (according to the standard of the hotel), very nice and well-equipped\u2026however \u2013 as it was not situated towards the seaside, we missed the great sea view with the snowy mountains in the background.

The hotels breakfast is very expensive, which made us walk to a very nice Italian coffee shop every morning to have the best of coffee and sandwiches (at a much more reasonable cost). What we did not like about the hotel, was the service at the front desk. The staff was too impersonal, too formal, not friendly at all in a nice way.

Nothing major but very annoying issues that kept happening throughout the night. We didn't take them up at the time of the issue as we were very tired and exhausted from walking the town. We should of called at the hour they occurred but didn\u2019t. We called down to the front desk and they were very short and rude with us the next morning. We then spoke to the manager on duty, who I was informed is only a part timer and she (Caroline) said she would get right back to us. Never heard back from her still even until today. This is what was the most frustrating. They didn\u2019t care enough to call us back to even tell us that they checked and there was nothing they could do. At check out, I had asked to speak to her and had to wait for 15 minutes before I was told she is in a private meeting and her office door is locked... Sounds like she was on lunch and the front desk was too lazy to figure this out before wasting my time. I had asked the front desk lady to please have her call us and left phone # with her. Nothing! We paid top dollar for a top hotel and they couldn't even call us back. WOW! I let a few days pass to see if maybe her \"private meeting behind a locked door\" was over and still heard nothing back. Today spoke to Darrin, who is the supposed full time manager and was very angry and frustrated that I had to call the hotel. He basically told me that he was sorry for everything but they can't do anything. He never asked if there was anything that could be done to make us feel satisfied with the 300 or so we blew at the hotel. I used some harsh language as he get basically calling me as I perceived it a liar and then informed me that I am no longer welcome in his hotel. Breakdown of charges: Walk in room rate of 161 +20 for upgraded harbor view. This was their rate not ours. $40 for parking for the night $5 for daily internet for 1 device Plus they wanted to charge us EXTRA for soap and towels but waived that fee. Are you kidding me? Is this normal? Extra for soaps and towels. When asking for toiletries, they had very little of what I needed, like Shaving Cream (yes I know, unusual request for a hotel to have shaving cream....) Funny thing, I am in the service industry. I have had customers yell, scream, curse, threaten violence to me and my family, put voo doo on me and the rest. There are often times that things happen, people have bad days etc. and never once did I tell them to not come back. I asked them to be calm and reasonable and said I understand why they are angry and am on their side to fix the issue. I also always asked the most important question to me, What can we do to fix this issue? This was never once asked. Had it been things would not have blown up. Darrin- I would never stay at your hotel or advise anyone to. It is a beautiful building and that is where it stops! Beds are double in the room not even queen. I wish you the best and hope your hotel ups their training. You guys act like people with 0 education. My wife is an attorney, cousin who I stayed with a doctor and I have an MBA. We are neither rude nor crude. We stay at nice places to get away from life and we often ask for some services. Is that not what the hospitality industry is for? Making our lives less stressful.

The staff were very friendly and professional at every step. We were in room 1910 and had amazing views of downtown and the North Shore (and the outdoor salt water pool!). The package my wife got included champagne, tuxedo strawberries, cake and a lovely rose - all were extremely lovely. Spoiled! The room itself was quite spacious - along with the bed, a desk and office chair, there was a lovely chaise longue and another occasional chair in the room. Plenty of space to lounge around. There was a large flat panel TV on the bureau in the corner, which was nice - if we'd been staying for longer, we would have enjoyed having it. The room was quite close to the elevators, but it was still very quiet and the bed was very comfortable, so we had an excellent night's sleep. The temperature controls in the room were easy to use and very responsive, so we were able to get the temperature down to our usual polar bear levels in no time. The bathroom was the only unspectacular part of the room - it was a little tight and there was no soaker tub, just the standard tub. But the water pressure in the shower was excellent and we both really enjoyed the bath products. We had dinner at the Five Sails restaurant in the hotel - amazing. The package we had included a $50 room service credit, so we had room service for breakfast - it too was very very good. Excellent lattes! My ONLY complaint had nothing to do with the hotel itself - a huge group of rowdy, heavily drinking fraternity kids from Seattle were at the hotel preparing for a booze cruise (because the drinking age in BC is only 19! Wooo! Chug chug chug! OMG, I'm gonna barf!) and they completely took over the outdoor pool and hot tub for a few hours, making it uncomfortable for the few guests (us, another couple) who were there for a quiet swim and who really really wanted a few minutes in the hot tub. Hotel security came out at one point to tell them no alcohol at the pool, but that just made them sneakier. Again, totally not the hotel's fault that their pool was invaded by Girls Gone Wild: Vancouver Edition, but it was still annoying. Overall, I'd absolutely stay here again - for pleasure or business.

Booking was a breeze. All of the dates we were looking for were available. The usual nightly rate is way beyond our normal trip price range but with the Groupon we were able to enjoy an extra bit of luxury without breaking the bank. Check in was fast and efficient. Our Suite The 23rd floor had amazing views of the city although it was not always as quiet as you would expect. Starting around 8am seaplanes took off in the harbor right below us. Thankfully I had packed our sound machine so it never woke our toddler up. We let our toddler have the living room of the suite. It was spacious enough to hold his travel crib at night and push it out of the way so we could play during the day. The mini bar fridge, although very well stocked, could still hold a quart of milk for early morning kid meals. The bedroom, along with the living room, sported a nice flat screen TV with basic cable. The bed was huge (a King) with enough pillows available to make even the most uncomfortable of pregnant women (that would be me) happy at night. If I needed more pillows it was just a Service One call button away. Unfortunately I pressed that little button a little too late on our first night. The hotel was fully booked and all of the Tempur-Pedic pillows had been checked out. Make sure you call as soon as you check in to reserve one. Every bathroom is bigger than the one we have at home so it isn't hard to impress me. As long as it is clean and in good repair you have pretty much won me over. The bathtub was perfect for our toddler to take a swim in before bed. I loved the multilevel shower flow that helped ease a little pregnancy back pain. My favorite feature was that the door to the bathroom could close in the entire bathroom or just the toilet so other family members could shower or throw some make-up while someone else took care of their business. Entertainment The room\u2019s entertainment was adequate but it did have a few hiccups. While the TVs were very nice, they only had analog cable TV, no digital. This could just be the tech snob in me coming out, although my husband pointed it out so I guess he is the snob not me. If you weren\u2019t in the mood for the cable channel offerings you could also order a Pay Per View movie for an additional cost. The Internet connection was fast enough to do some photo uploads. The most annoying thing was that you could only have one device logged in at a time. I have seen this set up only once before and it was in Vancouver as well. I\u2019m not sure if this is a universal hotel policy in the city, but it was extremely annoying. Free Wi-Fi and Internet access should be just that. If I am a guest, I want everyone in my room to be able to use it. Hotel Amenities Club Lounge- After the comfy bed, the Club Lounge was by far my favorite hotel amenity. There was fresh fruit plus tea and coffee service until 10pm every night. The lounge also served up a very nice breakfast. This saved us a considerable amount of money each day as dining in Vancouver is not cheap. Cereal, bagels, pastries, fresh fruit, meats and cheeses were all available. On top of these offerings there were two hot breakfast items each day. One morning it was mini French toast slices the next there were tiny quiche. We were not able to take advantage of the Happy Hour hor d\u2019ourves as we were usually headed out for dinner at that time. The offering was not substantial enough to replace a meal. It looked very nice though and several couples were taking full advantage of the lounge before they headed out for a late meal. Alcoholic beverages were not complimentary. Spa Utopia- The lowest point in our trip was my visit to Spa Utopia. It came across as being much to corporate for my taste. Everything felt so rushed. Luxury and relaxation were not the main focus. I wasn\u2019t even asked if I liked my service when I was checking out. The only saving grace was the nail specialist that chatted away with me during my pedicure. Outdoor Swimming Pool- We did not get to take advantage of the heated outdoor salt-water swimming pool and jacuzzi on the 8th Floor. It looked wonderful, but it was just too darn cold outside to venture a dip. The Location The Pan Pacific was centrally located right on the water next to the cruise terminal. The hotel is just above the convention center. This made finding reception a little confusing, but it was a great launching point to tackle the city. We were within walking distance of Gastown, Stanley Park (aquarium!) and the food and shops on Robson Street. A bus stop was just a short walk away and taxis were always close by. A food court is located across the street for any immediate snacking needs. Things did close down after office hours in this area, so be sure to check the restaurant hours before you head out. WARNING: Parking is not included in the cost of your room usually.

We chose the hotel because of its close proximity with enclosed walkway to the Convention Center, and because the banquet my father was attending was at the hotel itself. The convenience was fabulous. He was able to walk 30 ft from his room to the elevator, then down and out 50 feet from the elevator to the banquet room. Getting to the Convention Ctr was also easy for him with his walker. There were elevators most places. The only hitch was lack of elevator or escalator to the tunnel across the street to the food court and Fairmont Hotel. There are good stairs, however. I also chose the Pan Pacific because the reservation/front desk people were so helpful and welcoming! They continued after our arrival--even left us surprise birthday cake in our room for our arrival. I don't remember mentioning it was my birthday, but must have! Our room was beautiful. We upgraded to a \"corner\" room to have more space for three of us to move around. It had a nice sitting area for Dad to sit and relax. The view was fantastic of the harbor, Stanley Park, the mountains, etc., but I'm not sure, for the extra $$, it was any better than that of any other room on the water side. It wasn't a corner room as much as an end room. The beds were very comfortable and the bathroom beautiful. We ate in the cafe once and in the piano lounge once. Both were delicious and expensive. The service in both was top notch. I would recommend either spot. The concierge and front desk were both wonderful -as you would expect in a hotel of this caliber. Both were very welcoming and helpful. Parking was expensive-$39 per night; but parking is expensive everywhere in Vancouver. Our only complaint was with the valets.

The spectacular view and beauty of Vancouver (my home city) was somewhat symbolic of the occasion - to appreciate all that is near & dear to me at this stage in my life.

Had we been awake very early the next morning we might even have seen our cruise ship arrive. We did see a Holland America ship sail in and dock below our window. Dining in the hotel: There are restaurants in the adjoining mall and Gastown isn\u2019t too far away - but we were tired after a long flight and opted to eat dinner and breakfast in the hotel. It was very crowded, make a dinner reservation if you want to eat in the Pacifica restaurant. We didn\u2019t have a reservation so ate in the bar (same menu but a bit less comfortable for a meal). There is an a la carte option for breakfast but as the restaurant was very crowded the waitress recommended the buffet to avoid kitchen delays. Not a great fan of hotel buffets but this was an extensive one with plenty of choice, replenished in a timely fashion. Staff in the hotel were all pleasant and helpful, and we especially appreciated being able to send our luggage from the room to the ship. Then it was a simple matter to go down in the elevator to the embarkation point at Canada Place. They say they have never lost a bag, and sure enough we next saw it in our cabin, where it arrived before we did. All in all a good place to stay pre-cruise and would recommend it. Tip: If you are a foreign citizen then the embarkation process, clearing US Customs/Immigration, could be lengthy. Overall, it took us three hours to pass though the Vancouver Port Security and US customs/immigration process. If you are a non-US/Canadian cruise passenger staying in the Pan Pacific hotel pre-cruise (and I recommend that you do), be aware of the potential for delays in embarking. Apparently it is worse at the beginning and end of the cruise season, when apparently more foreign passengers are travelling. There was minimal delay for US/Canadian citizens, however all passengers should know that the Vancouver Port Authority screens your hand luggage and will ask you to open your bags if they detect sharp items. It won\u2019t be an issue if you have come straight off a plane, but if you have stayed overnight at a hotel and accessed your sharp items again, then be aware of the possibility. This screening process partly contributed to the delay in embarkation. It is thorough \u2013 they even found a small penknife which a British man had forgotten was in his hand luggage (and he had just come through Heathrow).", "Date": "January 1, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sudbury, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGreat location but typical of a downtown hotel\u201d", "Author": "Adrian M", "ReviewID": "UR122364910", "Content": "The room was ok but I must admit I only had one with a partial harbour view.

I can walk off the sea plane and practically right into the hotel which is great for an islander traveling to Vancouver. You can walk just a few blocks to practically any kind of food, gas town, and even Stanley Park isn't far. Some of the best shopping in Vancouver is 3-4 blocks away. Really can't think what might be a better location in Vancouver unless you want to be right by the hockey arena or football arena for an event (that's about 12 - 14 blocks away). We didn't even get what was considered a view room but we had some water view and a great view towards gas town and Burnaby. It was still stunning. My parents were in a different room and did have a view ... and WOW!!! Wow!!! Get a view room if you can. Even if you can't you will be awe struck by the views from the 5 sails restaurant and the lobby bar and restaurant. I can't say enough about that. Awesome even on grey days. We were there for a conference in the convention center and while you have to change elevators it's still very convenient as it's connected to the convention center. I didn't love the convention space but that's for a different review. The rooms are spacious and comfortable in every way. The layout is very smart and ensures you don't hear much noise from the hallway - which is so important for a light sleeper like me! The gym was smaller but had a window looking out onto the water which is so nice ... when I was there a sports team was using the gym at the same time as me and it was a little crowded (although you can't complain about 7 or 8 pro athletes training around you!! haha!!). It was hard to find floor space to do any stretching or push ups. But they have all the equipment anyone can need. I would suggest bringing a water bottle because they just have these little cone cups which are a pain for big water drinkers like me! What I didn't love about this hotel: Unfortunately I was going to fly but ended up driving and parking was $30/day and the parking lot is a frigging nightmare!!! It's massive. Make sure you stop at the front and get the concierge to take your stuff. Don't try and haul it all in from the parking lot because you'll probably end up parking 1/2 a mile from the door like we did and trolleys aren't allowed down there so we had to make 2 trips. YUCK. Better yet - get valet parking so you never have to experience the parking lot. And Sunday brunch was $50/person. Those are probably the only two complaints I had about this place - that and the staff at the restaurant at the lobby level were SOOOOO slow and not at all interested in helping you. We ate their 3 times and they were consistently bad at service and attentiveness. The only staff in the hotel that seemed to care less. Overall this is a FANTASTIC place where your comfort is taken care of and you can feed your eyes with some of the greatest views you'll find in the downtown Vancouver area.", "Date": "November 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Palm Desert, California", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful views; Great service\u201d", "Author": "RGT6416", "ReviewID": "UR120995418", "Content": "I stay at this hotel 4 times per year and have never been disappointed.

The hotel is easily accessible by the airport train so why taxi it if you're not in a big hurry? Check-in is up a couple of escalators from street level but from the street level, I wasn't aware of how many floors up I needed to go; maybe I missed the sign downstairs. The check-in staff was friendly, fast and efficient. The public areas are a part of the ship terminal and some convention space, so it's a little tight because of the open atrium. Yet, the beauty of it left a good impression on me. The room was what I believe to be a standard room but actually like a mini-suite with a separate sofa and chair sitting room with TV and plenty of space to spread out. It was far from cramped quarters like most hotels. There is a mini-bar area and the only fault was that one of the overhead bar lamps was out which made it hard to see the coffee and tea maker. There was a pay snack box which I did not use. An in-room minibar was also provided but I did not partake. The bed was huge and comfortable with nice support and superior quality sheets and soft bed coverings. Also, there was a nice desk area with pay internet connection with a nice view, if distracting while working. The view from this room was towards the east and not as picturesque as probably the west view towards the more scenic side of Vancouver (in my opinion) looking across the harbor and of the peninsula hills. Still, it had a nice water view on the left side and downtown view on the right side. The bathroom was spacious with separate soaking tub and shower stall. The vanity and sink area was nice as well with adequate lighting. The bath products were nice - I want to recall that they were Pan Pacific label but can't remember for sure - but definitely not the high end brand names like other comparable-rated hotel properties. The elevators were fast and no long waits like a lot of multi-story properties I've stayed at. There a several bars and restaurants that looked very inviting and with a good selection of seafood and turf, but can't comment on taste or quality from these establishments. I did not eat in any restaurants from the regular menu; however, the conference food was of high quality and presentation, and the ballroom wait service was extremely good and quite professional in their service approach. Didn't try room service as well so no comments. The hotel was definitely up there in the upper end of the four star properties but not solid five star; still, most travelers will not be disappointed. An upper end four star property is a nice compliment as far as North American hotels are concerned. I would stay here again for the excellent and professional service, great location along the water, and the ease of accessibility from the airport.

We booked a Lincoln Navigator 7 seater with trailer and they also provided complimentary car seats for the 2 x 4 year olds. We had 3 carryon bags and 3 suitcases all weighing about 20 kgs each. I booked a trailer thinking that there would not be enough boot space, anyway I realised that the trailer was not necessary. We arrived at the hotel around 9am and check in was not until 4pm. We were very fortunate as they had a room ready for us! After our long flight with 3 lil kids we were extremely grateful for the early check in. The room had 2 double beds and was suppose to have a sofa bed as well but instead it came with a chaise lounge. After a call to reception they quickly delivered a single roll away bed which was very comfortable. Also, the kids all got their own bath robes for the duration of the stay. What a fabulous idea! We utilised room service for dinner for 2 of the nights and the food was plentiful. The kids really enjoyed their meals (kids meal includes a main, drink and dessert for around the $14 not including taxes) and the room was large enough to eat comfortably. We also had the buffet breakfast and the food was fresh but sometimes you had to wait for the fruit to be replenished and the waffles to be cooked. Gastown was a short 10 minutes walk away and we also went to see the Olympic torch which was a leisurely 5 minute walk away. Outside the hotel there are a number of tour bus companies that offers a hop on and off tour around Vancouver. We chose Fun City Sightseeing as this was the only company that didn\u2019t charge for kids. Great for us $$ wise and the kids enjoyed the bus. We enjoyed staying at Pan Pacific, we never had any problems with the service and it is a great location for kids, plenty of room outside the hotel for the kids to run around and see all cruise ships. My only gripe, free Wifi should be offered to all of the hotel rooms. We went to Starbucks located just outside the hotel for the free wifi.", "Date": "October 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Capistrano Beach, California", "Title": "\u201cBest Hotel\u201d", "Author": "plumber22", "ReviewID": "UR119462271", "Content": "We were going on a cruise out of Vancouver.

Well our ship the Norwegian Star was leaving out of Ballantyne port so we ended up taking 2 taxis with us to the port. It was ok but this time the taxi driver tried to get us for extra money. This happened to us in New York before we had mom and Aunt Shirley take a cab and John and I did. Mom's cab got there almost 20 minutes after us and they charged them double our cost. This time John and mom went in one and got there is like 7 minutes and myself and Aunt Shirley got there in 20 minutes and said I thought he was abusing us and he said no but when we got to the port John was furious that our driver went way out of the way to triple charge us. So I just did not give him a tip. Watch out. Anyway back to the Pan Pacific it is absoultly wonderful. We had great rooms in a corner so they connected to each other and were huge.

The hotel had a number of restaurants and I chose one that had outside seating with a beautiful view of the harbor. The food was good, but be prepared for sticker shock on the prices.

I wanted it to be a special day so I went on Hotwire as nearly everyone I know does on last minute trips these days. I opted for the more expensive of the two choices between 4 star or 5 star hotels on hotwire, just to ensure that there would be great service and no chance of any problems. I mean 4 stars are still usually really great. Pan Pacific was the hotel we ended up with. When we got to the desk I was excited because it was very nice in the lobby and a great location. The first thing I heard was the guy beside me was offered a free upgrade to the harbour side which is an amazing view and it looked like it made his day. So I figured maybe I'd see if we could get one too. So the woman working looked us up and checked us in and pretty much gives us everything before saying \"Oh by the way your room has two double beds\" I'm thinking oh they'll just switch that since we're obviously a couple. Nope apparently there are no queens or kings available to us. Confused I asked why and she basically made us feel like second class customers because we booked on hotwire. Getting frustrated I assumed that she didn't have enough experience with this type of situation and a manager could help. The manager was even more condesending of our hotwire booking status and again there were only double beds available to our \"type\" of booking. After some discussion it became apparent that there were actually some king bed rooms but that we would have to upgrade to it for a $40 fee. Now I'm thinking why didn't I just get the 4 star room that wasn't on the water because it would have the same view for half the price and I would get to sleep beside my OWN FIANCE! After going in circles with the manager and the first girl snickering that she was right about us being lesser clients I paid the money and didn't get any upgrades and spent an hour getting back into holiday happy mindset. I was just expecting better service from a hotel like this. And if it really bugs you that people use hotwire to book your rooms DON'T PUT YOUR ROOMS ON HOTWIRE.

City View\u201d", "Author": "Godzilladude", "ReviewID": "UR116998998", "Content": "For the wife's milestone birthday, she had said she wanted to see Vancouver. So I quietly arranged a trip. After pricing everything out separately, I checked Travelocity, and had several options for three nights of hotel, effectively for free! I finally decided to spend the money, and go for Pan Pacific, as I really wanted a room with a view. I ended up paying only about $100 a night for a Harbor View Room, normally more like $400/nt. I really himmed and hawed about whether to get a \"Harbor View\" room, or, a \"City View\" room and hope for an free upgrade, as is often mentioned here. As I was prepaying, I figured I better hedge upward and got the Harbor View, whatever that meant. And that turned out to be the correct choice, as no upgrade. Maybe because of a Travelocity pre-purchase, maybe just no rooms available, I dunno. What they don't make clear on the website, is what \"City View\" and \"Harbor View\" actually mean. After all the hotel is a wedge out on a pier, all the rooms are 8th floor or above, and you can see harbor and city from pretty much all the rooms. The difference is, I found out, the Harbor View rooms are on the west side, the City View rooms are on the east side. The ones facing west get to see the pretty Coal Harbor area, the Yacht Club, Stanley Park is only a mile or so away staring right back atcha, high rises condos and hotels all lit up in town, Capilano Bridge in the distance all lit up at night, and lots of water, with mountains in the distance. The view is just spectacular! The rooms that face east, \"City View\", you can still see the bay and lots of mountains in the distance, but you're looking down on the container docks, the rail yard, the SeaBus dock, and fewer high-rises in the city. So, Harbor View if you can afford it. The view from our room, out two 6'X6' windows, was just wonderful, by far the nicest view I have EVER had at a hotel room. All the staff we met were very helpful and friendly. I actually stumped the Conceirge with a basic question about mass transit, which was a bit surprising. They do have a summary sheet with bus directions to most of the major tourist attractions, something one might want to call ahead for when making plans. The deck on the harbor side of the lobby is just great as well, never crowded, several stories up. and had most of it to ourselves most of the time, to just sit back and watch the world go by. The LOCATION of the Pan Pacific is also wonderful if you are planning on sightseeing without a car. The Canada Line train runs direct from the airport to Canada Place, only a block or two to walk to get to the hotel, not five minutes. Most all the public buses and shuttle buses you might want to catch are within a block or two. And the SeaBus to go over to North Vancouver is right there. Walk out the hotel and right onto the Sea Wall for a beautiful walk over towards Coal Harbor and Stanley Park. Almost every other hotel is town is blocks from the waterfront. NONE can match the views of being high up, out on the pier. The bed was excellent, and I'm picky. There is an underground shopping area connected directly to the hotel (and many other hotels, no doubt), that includes a decent inexpensive food court, with McDonalds, Tim Hortons, some Chinese, fresh fruit and bagels, pizza, etc. Downsides, not much. They nickel and dime on Internet WiFi access ($2/hr, $6/day), which is just silly nowadays. Ditto for water in the room. I won't pay $37 for a basic breakfast buffet. And they don't have their own shuttle to go anywhere. So, walk a block or two and wait five minutes for the bus, on occasion. Still, the best mass transit access in the city, I would wager, being so close to Canada Place. Absolutely, positively, we will stay here next time we are up that way. And we will be back, what a great city.

We were surprised to be checked in at 10:30 a.m., and we were fortunate to be put into room 1834, a corner room with a remarkable view. There were sailboats and yachts. We watched seaplanes land and take off right below us, ferries glide back and forth on their routes, and cruise ships appear when we woke up and majestically sail away in the late afternoon. Location Super-central. We took the SkyTrain from the airport (a credit card works in the ticket machines, and there is lots of space for suitcases) to Waterfront station and wheeled our suitcases to the hotel. We understand that construction of Canada Place, including the Pan Pacific Hotel and East convention center was built on the Canadian Pacific Railroad Pier site using Japanese money at a time when the city was short of cash. Now it is the center of activity for conferences, cruise ships, and a wonderful hotel. The hotel is within a short walk of Gastown and downtown. On the advice of the concierge, we caught a #50 bus to the shops on Granville Island, but we found the merchandise and prices to be better in nearby Gastown. It is a short walk to the seaplane terminal where a short Harbour Air tour of the nearby mountains and valleys is a good value if it is a clear day. Room Our room was large, clean, and well appointed with coffee maker, refrigerator, and huge flat screen TV with many channels. The curtains blocked out the morning light, although it was a temptation to leave them open at night because the view was so inspiring. The Pan Pacific Hotel is designed to look like the superstructure of a huge ship. The large windows looked like ship's windows, rounded at the corners. Rooms ending in \"34\" had the best view in the hotel with the \u201cliving roof\u201d of the West Convention Center, Coal Harbour, Stanley Park and Lion\u2019s Gate bridge on the left and the bare edge of the container terminal on the extreme right (see photo taken from seaplane). The snow-capped mountains of the northern range extended through each of the windows with the buildings of North Vancouver lining the shore. The bed and pillows were very comfortable, and there was a sofa. I counted eleven wall plugs (including two in the bathroom) that were not being used. Restaurants Every superb hotel needs a superb restaurant. Five Sails was superb. We recommend the Austrian ravioli and their ice wines. The other two restaurants, the Cascades Lounge and the Cafe Pacific use the same basic menu--we had wild salmon at the former and spinach infused curry chicken at the latter, and we could not recommend either one. We would rather go to the food court under the Fairmont hotel. Don\u2019t miss Five Sails for the view and the food, though (see photo). Quiet enjoyment Usually we do not want a connecting door but we had one in room 1834, and it was never a noise problem. The only commotion was the sound of a party two floors below on a narrow terrace. The occasional sound of neighbors on both sides was not distracting or irritating. Internet Thank goodness we were GHA Discovery members. On check-out, our bill was three pages long until the cashier took off the Internet charges (free to members) and reduced the bill to a half a page. Both wi-fi and LAN were reliable and fast and available all over the hotel, which was convenient for use of smart phones. Services All of the staff were capable and friendly and helpful. The concierge is super-busy, but it is well staffed by one or two people, and staff are helpful and friendly when you get to see them. Doormen did not force themselves on us. Lifts were quiet and fast. The shops in the hotel had a good selection of merchandise for sale. We had the idea they were catering to passengers on cruise ships who had little time to shop. They provide great ball point pens in the rooms and at the reception desk. For comfort and service, the Pan Pacific Vancouver was absolutely outstanding.

When we arrived and were given our room on the 18th floor we immediatly noticed a odor. Smelled like wet carpet or simlar. We decided to put on air conditioner and leave it to see if it would go away. We after about 3 hours seemed to be worse so we went to front desk. They were very helpful. First gave us a room on 8th floor near the pool which we rejected due to constant noise. Then offered a 21st floor room with harbor view. Well it was super. Great views of harbor and a little of downtown. We didn't eat much at the hotel except for breakfast as there are many other places within walking distance. Its a bit pricey but given where you are you expect that. The lounge at night is the perfect way to end your day. Great views of the float planes coming and going as well as the cargo ships.

There is also an underground walkway between both wings and the hotel, should the weather be uncooperative to walking outside.

In addition to a comfy bed and large work desk, I had a side chair and chaise lounge, next to floor to ceiling windows with a terrific view of the harbor. I did find that the desk chair was uncomfortable, as it was too low for me and wasn't adjustable. I had to stack a few pillows on the seat to be at the right height. The bathroom was large, comfortable and very clean. Marble floors and wide counter space around the sink, plus a separate room with door for the toilet. I appreciated the Aveda bath products which were very nice. The in-room coffee service was good (tasty coffee), and includes fresh milk and cream at no charge in your mini-bar. What a great touch, for a \"real\" coffee drinker! There's also a starbucks right next to the lobby of the hotel, in case you need a more complex coffee fix. I ordered room service breakfast 3 times during my stay, and it was punctual and tasty, if a bit overpriced, but it's room service...don't we expect a huge service charge by now? Finally, I found the service overall at the hotel to be excellent. Very friendly staff all around, including helpful concierges that made a good recommendation for a nearby sushi restaurant that was terrific.

Overall its a nice hotel with beautiful views but it was not family friendly (more below). We booked this hotel in July 2010 for our May 2011 stay. We booked the Family Getaway Package (which included 2 rooms and a few amenities). Good: - Even though we were not in a suite we had a view of both the city and the waterfront. It was a very nice view. - Breakfast Buffet at Cafe Pacifica was very good - Hotel is in a great location and within walking distance of many restuarants and stores Not so Good: - Upon check-in worker behind desk felt it was their duty to come around the counter and scold my children by telling them to \"To Be Quiet\". Let me state I am a big believer in child discipline and sometimes I am hard on my children to a fault (they are currently 8 and 4) but they were not demonstrating any obnoxious behavior that would warrant an employee to come around the corner and scold them. This really left a bad taste in my mouth. - Bell services decided to use my camera bag as a door stopper when delivering our luggage to our room. Seriously, of all the things to use a door stopper you use the bag with some of the most expensive equipment. - Our package included breakfast in the cost of the rooms. Upon returning home I found they charged us $107.xx for breakfast. After a call to the hotel they resolved the issue within an hour (still waiting on the refund to post to the CC). Not a service issue but would have been nice category: - No Internet without pay - I'm not stating this is the hotels fault but it seems that in this day and age to pay for internet at most high end hotels seems a bit much. - The rooms seemed a little dated with the furniture - I expected rich coloring furniture - instead it looked more (in my opinion) like furniture I would find in most Florida rooms. Again not an issue with the hotel per se..... - The package we booked included a free movie, cookies and milk for the children, juice/soda and popcorn for the adults. You had to call down to order the food items - While it was nice I thought the cookies would have been \"homemade\" instead they were packaged \"semi-cheap\" type cookies.

Well done! Yes, we opted to splurge on the Club Level, availing ourselves of great views from an adequate-sized room. I can sympathize with one reviewer who claimed to be able to watch life from the windows without ever leaving the room.

The complimentary goodies on the Club Floor are excellent, with an expanded continental buffet breakfast, snacks throughout the day, and evening hors-d'oeuvres (not really enough to fill up on for a meal). One glass of wine or one bottle of beer per guest is complimentary. Cocktails are extra. Be prepared to pay the 12% tax on everything, with an additional 3\u00bd% added on the hotel bill. All check-ins and check-outs are handled in the Club Lounge, and the host (or hostess) will print--for free--boarding passes. We've been to Vancouver several times and even stayed at the Pan Pacific twenty years ago.

Vancouver has seen a lot of new hotels appear during the run up to the 2010 winter games and so the Pan Pacific doesn't represent the most up to date Vancouver offering in terms of the design of it's showcase common areas, which are starting to look a little dated. However, it still provides extremely good service, exceptional rooms, and unbeatable views. This January, we stayed for three nights in a pacific pearl room. This is one of the best rooms I have stayed in. I suspect it has recently been renovated as it was spotless. It was huge, had very high quality, stylish furnishings and fittings. There is a massive, very comfortable bed (queen I think) and bed-linen is of a noticeably high quality. Bathrobes and two sets of slippers are supplied. The bathroom features a high quality modern style sleek marble finish with double hand basins, a separate dresser, separate w/c, large walk in rain effect shower with side jets, and a large bath with a sliding opaque window should you want to relax and enjoy the view. The view of the mountains harbour and Lions Gate bridge is of the best views from any hotel room in the world. One morning we reported a problem with the temperature range of the shower which was fixed by the time we returned that evening. A notable improvement affecting this hotel since the winter games has been the adjacent areas to the east. The once very run-down and tacky areas around gas-town have been transformed into a collection of interesting bars, clubs and shops posed to supplant the once hip Yaletown. Whilst the design of the common areas of the hotel could do with being brought up-to-date with the competition, the Pan Pacific still offers excellent service and quality in an unbeatable location.", "Date": "February 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Florida", "Title": "\u201cMemorable in the best way.

The property is \"right in the middle\" of activities in the downtown Vancouver area, with plenty of sights, restaurants, etc. within easy walking distance. Although the hotel is part of a convention center (Canada Place), and is pretty caverous, its modern nautical flair architecture is pleasing. The staff was universally friendly. As an example, when the rooms we reserved were not available, we were upgraded into a luxury suite. After the first night the kids preferred to have two separate rooms (which we had reserved), and the staff cheerfully moved us into those. All of our rooms were very nice with great views.

So I picked Pan Pacific, despite some warning about it being a cruise ship hotel (it is on top of the Canada Place, a national landmark where most of the Alaskan Cruises depart). But it definitely was a surprisingly pleasant stay. 4 things I have to mention. 1) The View: Upon reaching its lobby level, the beautiful view of the Vancouver harbor, Lions Gate Bridge, and the mountains range to the right of it dominated my view. Harbor facing side of the lobby had a 5 floor high uninterrupted and expansive glass wall. And I booked an inner harbor view room with basically the same stunning view. The room was large with a king and a lounge chaise. Clean, comfortable with a decent bath room. 2) The pool: it is said to be the best pool and jacuzzi in town, not because of it's size or depth (not large and very shallow), but for it's view and tanning potential. Facing the same harbor view on the 8th floor terrace and with ample lounging chairs for tanning and people watching, I would probably have to agree (Four Seasons and Shangri-la only have indoor pools and Opus doesn't even have one). Only thing is if you order drinks, you might have to wait for awhile, their room service department seems to be a little understaffed during the tanning hours. 3) The Sunday brunch: I'm not usually one for the buffet, but from what I've seen, the Sunday brunch is all fresh supplies (not your usual let's-get-rid-of-week-long-left-over Sunday brunch). It does reminded me of a luxury cruise ship brunch. You might want to book ahead, the seats filled up rather quickly. The only downside is if you want to sleep in after a long night of partying, you might have some trouble if you are a light sleeper. There is a float plane terminal right next to the hotel, the first flight could be as early as 9 am and the cruise ships might blow their horns around noon. But for me, I throughly enjoyed my stay and with my corporate discount, I ended up saving my company close to half of what usually the other 2 hotels (yeah, the other 2 don't do have discount in their vocabulary) would have charged me.", "Date": "August 14, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Philadelphia, PA", "Title": "\u201cDisappointing stay\u201d", "Author": "FussyTraveler99", "ReviewID": "UR74842098", "Content": "We were at the Pan Pacific because my husband's conference was right next door.

The not so good: we had two \"double\" beds, but they certainly seemed smaller than any other doubles we've ever been in in many years of marriage. The mini-bar fridge didn't work, even to cool a bottle of water. Several requests for assistance in order to cool medication as needed went unheeded. We were there 5 nights and it was not until the last one, after 3 requests, that we got any service. Not what I expected from a hotel that prides itself on service. A few other small annoyances: no free Wifi anywhere, including the lobby or business center. No real lobby area to meet people.

In general it was a very pleasant experience at a full-service business hotel with a convenient location, but there were a couple of issues that might make me look at some of the other great full-service hotels near the convention center. And I cannot recommend Vancouver itself highly enough - a great location with mountains and sea, spectacular shopping and amenities, and great dining. Can't wait to go back. We had a suite on a high floor with a great view, EXCELLENT bed with high end mattress and linens, and a separate living room with a wet bar. Bathroom, wet bar with mini bar and long counter, and furniture in living room all great - two flat screen TV's. Staff kept the room spotlessly clean, room service was prompt and included the entire menu from the cafe. I loved the pool deck - a heated pool and super-hot (hooray!) whirlpool from which you could experience sunrise and sunset. Pool is long enough to do laps, and during our stay, it was very calm with few visitors and those visitors were quiet and contemplative. Perfect. The hotel is connected to the convention center and two blocks from the excellent public transport (train) station. The Gastown district is an easy walk, but I found it much less inviting than other parts of Vancouver - lots of generic tourist type restaurants and lots of panhandler/homeless men, which made it a little menacing for a woman. However, I strongly recommend the PourHouse in the Gastown district - great cocktails and excellent regional food in a casual, friendly atmosphere. Also recommend Bishops Restaurant downtown and the Punjabi district for fun costume jewelery shopping. The cons for this hotel: -no decent lobby bar scene - both Fairmonts within spitting distance had much better lobby bar scenes, which is part of the conference experience. Fairmont Pacific Rim's bar was especially groovy. -food was celestially expensive although typical for the convention hotels, and of high quality -service is the cafe was glacial but friendly - they always seemed to be under staffed with wait staff and we had to be very assertive on numerous occasions to get someone to take our order. Once ordered, service was fine - but twice we waited a half hour to order. -our safe failed a couple of times and we had to wait long periods of time for help, which was tough with a convention schedule. Staff admitted that the safe was a problem, and there were marks on the floor where it had been repaired before - so why is it still there? For the cost of this hotel, this is nonsense. -wifi was CAN $16/day and dropped constantly. I have major issues with being nickled and dimed in high end hotels over internet - but I do expect it to work. We prepaid for five days, so I addressed it at checkout and expected it to be removed, since it was extremely disruptive and unreliable. I had to speak to the manager, who said that because the hotel had not had a chance to correct the error, we had to pay the full rate. I pointed out that the safe repair took three visits by staff and was disruptive and inconvenient, and that we checked our internet at 5 am and late in the evening and didn't want to miss convention events to sit on the phone with their tech support or have their staff in our room at such late or early hours (as if they would have had tech staff available at these times). After a tussle, she cut the bill in half, which irritated me. Had I complained earlier in the week (or lied and said I did), they would have removed the whole charge. Since we had no issues with wifi at the convention center or the airport, I think the issue was with the walls in the room. Overall, I thought the whole battle was unbecoming a high end business hotel in which the wifi is pure profit. But lesson learned - next time I'll complain earlier. Overall, I liked the hotel and it provided most of the amenities I expected for the price and for a convention hotel. However, I would probably give the Fairmont Pacific Rim a try on the next visit - chic and gorgeous with a better lobby bar scene.", "Date": "August 9, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Las Vegas", "Title": "\u201cAmazing start to an amazing trip!\u201d", "Author": "vacationmlc", "ReviewID": "UR73969536", "Content": "The Pan Pacific was a great start to our Alaskan Cruise, bags were taken from the room right to the room on the ship.

We got to the hotel and were advised upon check in that they did not have our room available. This was at 5:00pm so not exactly late. We were told we would need to upgrade to another room for an extra $60 a night. Sort of defeated the TravelZoo promo. The front desk clerk was unhelpful and we were told the booking was non refundable and in no way were we guaranteed to get the room we booked, since it was booked at a sale price. Would have been nice to know that when we booked. We got the impression we were a bit second class since we didnt pay full price. The room and facility itself was alright, nothing too extraordinary. Worth noting if you need internet access its an extra 15.95 for 24 hrs, parking is also an extra $30 overnight. .Local calls from your room also cost. We ended up with $200 in surcharges over 2 nights , and no, we didnt hit room service or the mini bar :) I realize I sound like the money was an issue, not so, it just drives me crazy when places charge a premium for basic services, like its something exclusive to make a call or use the internet. rather than just charging a higher room rate and including the basics you'd expect. Nice views though and a good location for some business we had downtown. I did email the customer service rep regarding their booking policy, and our disappointment on not receiving the room we booked or any advance notice there might be an issue .

It was a short one night stay as we were leaving on a cruise, and we only wish we had had the opportunity to spend much more time at this wonderful hotel. Our stay didn't start out so smoothly. We had an early morning flight, so we arrived to check-in at the hotel at 9am. They didn't have a room ready for us (which was fine and what we expected), so the lady at the front desk took our mobile number and said she'd call us when a room was ready. Once it got to be 4pm (check-in time) and we still hadn't heard anything, I went to the front desk to inquire. They seemed confused and claimed that we had already been provided a room key. When we said that we hadn't, more confusion ensued. At this point, Ash, one of the gentlemen at the front desk was trying to assist us. I assume the original room we had reserved was unavailable, because Ash offered us an upgrade to a corner suite. He did mention that it was a smoking room, but we could try it and let him know if it would work for us or not. When we opened the door to the room, we were amazed. It was a beautiful room, with windows on all sides and spectacular views of the harbor. The linens were high quality and the beds were amazingly comfortable. The room was spotless and obvious care had been takien in cleaning and maintaining the room. I have stayed at several 5-star hotels, and this room ranks among my top favorites. The hotel itself is lovely as well. When we were there, they were just finishing up renovations and the whole place sparkled. Some of the staff was aloof, as previous reviews have mentioned. But we were impressed by the service we received from Ash at the front desk and Shelley at the concierge desk. The hotel is perfectly located in downtown Vancouver and right on the water. In fact, we were able to wake up in the morning and watch our cruise ship dock from our room. The hotel is located at Canada Place. And, admitedly, the hotel is a little awkward to navigate. Access from the outside deck areas to the rest of Canada Place is blocked, so it takes a bit of walking all the way down a couple of levels and back to the front of the hotel to access Canada Place. Also, finding the hotel's gym is a wild goose chase, as it is seperate from the hotel and actually in the parking lot for the cruise ship terminal. It is a great little facility, though, once you figure out how to access it. We ate buffet breakfast at the hotel's restaurant, both the morning we left for the cruise and the morning we returned, and really enjoyed both the service and the food - they have these fantastic serve-yourself smoothies in pitchers available - and all of the rest of the food was terrific. We were really happy with our stay here. It is a high-end hotel that is not cheap, but well worth it. You can't find a better location in Vancouver.

The bathrooms are functional but small. The restaurants, public spaces and banquet rooms, with their unrivalled harbour setting, are awesome, but the food is just OK. In some other places, OK food might pass. Not here. Vancouver has one of the most interesting, diverse and mouth-watering food scenes in North America. The Five Sails, ostensibly a high end restaurant, is just out of synch with its competition and not up to snuff for what it charges. At least the Four Seasons recognized this two years ago, renovated, and opened Yew, which is both an inviting space and a dinner destination.

LOCATION: Downtown Vancouver, over looking the harbour & Stanley Park. Easy access to the \"Canada Line\" and transit, Gastown, Stanley Park and Robson Street. There are beautiful walkways along the harbour with places to stop for coffee, lunch, a drink or simply to sit on a bench & enjoy the view. It's attached to the Convention Centre and cruise ship dock as well. About 25 minutes via taxi from the airport or you can take the Canada Line train. You enter the hotel on street level but take either the escalator or elevator up 2 floors to the check in area. ROOM: We asked for one with a view of Stanley Park and the harbour-we weren't disappointed. The room itself was slightly dated with older carpeting and the shower/tub should be updated. The king size bed was very comfortable and had crisp, clean linens. There was a nice lounge chair that faced the large windows overlooking the harbour. Also handy to have an in room safe, umbrella, fully stocked mini bar with snacks and a 40 inch HD flat screen television with all the channels & movies you could want. Very good toiletries were provided and there is a handy make up mirror as well. Note that when you check in they offer you a \"complimentary newspaper\", which is the Globe & Mail. When you look at the holder for your room keys, it actually says if you decline the newspaper, the cost per day will be deducted from your bill. You also receive an actual key instead of card access. Therefore, anyone can access the room floors via the elevators and I did notice signs posted saying \"no view\" at the elevator area. DINING: For breakfast we simply walked over to the food court (connected to the hotel underground) which has a vast array of dining options (including Tim Horton's for coffee). There is a restaurant open for breakfast in the hotel if you prefer or order room service. We chose to eat dinner away from the hotel as well, but there is a beautiful dining option at Sails. In the lounge we sat and enjoyed coffee & drinks while listening to the entertainment of piano and singing. It was fabulous, with large windows overlooking the habour lit up at night. FITNESS/SPA: We finally located the fitness centre, which is in the parkade. The equipment was newer and the facility wasn't busy when we checked it out (your room key is required to enter). The spa was fantastic and very busy. They offer every service imaginable-we had a couples massage & were given 10% off with our stay. We also enjoyed the outdoor heated pool and jacuzzi. There is an area with fresh towels to use and tables & chairs around the pool....again, great views. SERVICE/SHOPS: Checking in and out was a breeze. We found the front desk staff helpful in providing maps and ideas of where to eat outside of the hotel. Our room was cleaned to our satisfaction. Service in the lounge was attentive and prompt.

It has the standard amenities of any upscale hotel: robes, room service, restaurants, Aveda products, cleanliness, etc. What it's lacking are a few things that make this hotel \"exceptional.\" First, a minor point to some, major to others, is the fact that you have to go outside to get to the Starbucks. The hotel advertises this resource, however, you must actually leave the hotel, and turn around to access. Depending on weather, this could be significant. Second, the location is \"good\". We were able to walk to some of the tourist areas pretty well (Gastown), but definitely needed a taxi for most areas. The one great thing is that it's right next to a subway terminal. We ended up using the subway a few times, although downtown Vancouver is not fully established as a subway city (metro Vancouver definitely is). This hotel is quite new. If you like the newness of hotels, you will appreciate this one. On the contrast, it does not have much character or personalization. Your preferences will guide this. My title says it all.

Because we were on the Concierge Level, we had been instructed to take the elevator up to the 23rd floor and check in there. This avoided all the confusion that many TA contributors have stated about regular check in on the main level. The room, while smaller than anticipated, was recently redone, and the furnishings and other appointments were quite nice. There was ample room to store our cruise luggage. The view from the room was the reason that we chose this hotel. We had a beautiful view of the shoreline of Vancouver, Stanley Park, the Lion\u2019s Gate bridge and North Vancouver which was spectacular. As an additional benefit, we were able to see our ship arrive and watch it dock at the pier. The breakfast selection, while limited, was quite sufficient. They had a pod coffee machine which made superb espresso. The hors d\u2019oeuvres were much better than anticipated, and the honor bar was stocked with a nice selection of wines, liquor and soft drinks. The staff in the Concierge lounge was helpful and attentive. While we could have let the hotel deliver our luggage directly to our ship, we opted to take it ourselves, which was quite easy. We took the hotel elevator down to the embarkation level and managed to navigate our way through the hoards of debarking/embarking passengers from two large ships that were also docked at Canada Place. The hotel is a large, impersonal, busy place with conventions and meetings taking place frequently. However, what it lacks in intimacy and charm, it makes up for in location, location, location!

That said, it is a grand building with internal features to match. It is very spacious, but seems more at home with dealing with conference delegates than just tourists. Our superior room on the 21st floor lived up to its billing, with fantastic views of the harbour, mountains and Stanley Park. The neighbouring cruise ship terminal was not a problem for us. Indeed, on one occasion 3 cruise ships had obviously tied up overnight and we hadn't heard a thing. Similarly, the seaplane base is situated quite close to the Pan Pacific and they do operate at regular intervals thoughout the day (from 7am to 7pm), but their activities are not especially intrusive, at least not from the 21st floor! Eating in the Pan Pacific is a bit limited. The breakfast buffet offers the standard fare. It's beautifully presented, if a little expensive compared to other buffets in similar quality hotels elsewhere. The dinner menu offers rather limited choice, again on the dear side and the service was not especially swift. We ate in the Cascades Lounge, but you need to be seated quite early (6pm-7pm) to be sure of a table by the window overlooking the harbour. A note of warning though, on our last night in the restaurant/lounge, a mouse scuttled across the floor while we were eating. Pointing this out to our server, it was evident that this was by no means an isolated incident or the first such incident. Indeed, we were informed that one of her colleagues had spotted one earlier. Local building works and the nearby cruise ship terminal were blamed for disturbing the local rodent population!! Stanley Park is do-able on foot from the hotel if the weather is good. If not local buses run right outside the hotel. Stanley Park is highly regarded. Yes, it's a lovely park but nothing really to set it apart from lots of others around the world. If you plan on taking in a whale watching tour off Vancouver Island, beware that the coach and ferry option to take you to your whale boat company in Victoria will take approx 5 hours door to door. After 3 hours on the whale boat watching the resident population of Orca (killer whales) that are magnificent, there is then the prospect of another 5+ hours return trip to your hotel. If the weather is not especially good, it can seem like an eternity. Another option to consider, which we took advantage of, is to catch a seaplane (for approx CDN$250 for 2), which will drop you off almost outside the Pan Pacific in 35 minutes from Victoria. It was brilliant, and the smoothest take off and landing you're ever likely to experience. While in Vancouver we'd booked a day trip to Whistler on the Whistler Mountaineer. I'm sorry to say Whistler didn't live up to our expectations. It's a rather small village and naturally enough caters almost exclusively for the winter sports set. It's scenery is stunning, though and in danger of being overwhelmed by all those who descend on it for the 2010 Winter Olympics. The 3 hour journey on the Whistler Mountaineer was absolutely brilliant. The onboard team and their service could not be faulted and we loved every minute of the journey.

The hotel was undergoing renovations on the entrance floors so it was a bit hectic trying to figure out where check-in was. The hotel service people were very nice but obviously busy. The hotel lobby was crowded with many cruise ship guests going to and fro. Once we checked in though, the room was very nice and quiet.

We took the 257 bus from the Horseshoe Bay ferry terminal and then walked to the hotel from the bus stop at W. Georgia and Burrad. Really quite convenient and cheap compared to taking a taxi. The main downside to the Pan Pacific was that it was totally not cute, or homey, or anything like that \u2013 it felt like everyone was busy. Actually it felt like staying in a huge conference center or something. Overall this hotel was worth $166 dollars given its great location and nice beds and bathroom but I would recommend checking out some other downtown hotels such as those on Robson Street. If booking on Hotwire or Priceline also consider some of the non-5* hotels because I\u2019m sure there were other 3* and 4* hotels that would have been just as nice as the Pan Pacific and maybe even a few dollars cheaper.

I spent four nights here and was so pleased with the entire situation that, at times, I didn\u2019t even want to go out exploring. My first room, booked through Hotwire.com, looked across the street to the rising towers of Vancouver. The second room, booked through the hotel itself, (which incidentally honored its pledge to beat a lower advertised rate and provided $75.00 in meal charges) overlooked the panorama of the inner harbor with its constant flow of float planes, cruise ships, tankers, tour boats, tugs and yachts. Add to this the cities on the distant shore, the backdrop of forested mountains, and an expansive sky animated by changing light and weather, and it became easy to linger at the window and just watch. What previous reviewers have said - opt for the even numbered inner harbour rooms - is correct: It is very worth the added expense. The hotel\u2019s location also turned out to be important for other reasons. It is steps from the Waterfront Terminal which launches Sky Train, city buses and the little Seabus, a ferry that crosses the harbor to Lonsdale all day long. Skytrain\u2019s brand new Canada Line brings visitors right to this terminal from the airport. Between the hotel and terminal you will find an underground food court for inexpensive meals. Canada Place and Imax share the hotel complex. Across the street is Vancouver\u2019s visitor\u2019s center. Guests walk the promenade along the landscaped shoreline to Coal Harbour where they can board a luncheon or dinner cruise. (Loved it!) One reviewer commented that the Pan Pacific has no soul. Actually, I think the Pan Pacific might have BECOME a part of the greater city\u2019s soul. In terms of the accommodations, I was totally satisfied. Both rooms were lovely, quiet, clean and up-to-date. Linens: soft and white. Bathroom: marble and gold, with abundant hot water and fine bath products. Desk: generous. Thermostat: responsive. Privacy: complete. The staff morale seems uniformly high: Everyone I met appeared to be proud of the hotel and genuinely pleased to assist their guests. The concierge team, for example, was consistently willing to dig deep for details and quickly report back by phone and letter delivered to the room. All transactions in the lobby were smooth and friendly with no waiting, even when the large cruise ships had arrived in port. Restaurants were good, and on three evenings, as the day dimmed and the harbor lights began to glitter. I found every reason to dine in. Of course, its superb view and location are what make this a special property, but the comfort of the accommodations and the warmth of those at work in the lobby and restaurants (not to mention housekeeping) perfected my visit to Vancouver. What I experienced was a hotel in a five-star location that offers five-star hospitality without a single sign of burnout, arrogance, or exclusivity. In fact, there was a detectable level of positive energy among staff and guests alike. Other travelers I met expressed similar delight with their stay.

Traveling with extended family and with a rental car, we were open to staying near the Vancouver Int'l Airport in Richmond, BC. Doggedly looked for deals at all the usual travel sites, and one day the homework paid off because Expedia had a one-day special offer sale... The package (2 hotel rooms+Hertz rental car) price we paid was $200-$300 USD LESS than staying at Hampton Inn, Holiday Inn Express, River Rock Casino in Richmond,, The Sutton Place, Westin, Fairmont, etc....basically less than any other type of hotel, including budget to luxury chains. Granted, they were \"city-view\" rooms, which they disclosed in the deal, and supposedly more than 80% of the Pan Pacific Vancouver's rooms have harbour views. We overhead some cruisers ask if they could upgrade to a room with a view...the friendly hotel clerk said if they didn't mind a smoking room, she'd upgrade them to a harbour view room for free. So, there's a tip. This hotel and the Fairmont Waterfront right across the street are very popular amongst cruisers staying overnight. The parking garage fee, as expected in a major city, was $30CAD a day. Even so, our package was such a bargain that we were fine with the parking fees for a three night stay. After all, we traveled around the national Canada Day holiday period (and during America's July 4th weekend). The skytrain stop is accessible if you go to the ground floor (two escalators down from the check-in lobby floor) that can take you to the street exit, but continue down to the Canada Place/Waterfront food court. Signs show you the skytrain. Due to 2010 Olympics, they will expand Skytrain to the airport. That will be great, but if traveling with elderly relatives, a rental car is still the best way to take it easy on vacation. Tourist center is across the street. Pros: Pretty, clean, very well located. Great choice if you have a special deal. Cons: high parking fee if you really need to rent a car; you can hear neighboring rooms' showers and the doors are thin...you can hear guests talking at a normal decibel very clearly right outside your door; if your room's near the lifts/elevators, you will also hear the elevators go \"ding ding\" whenever they arrive at your floor.

It's a contemporary luxury hotel. It's a great location right on the water and a great spot in downtown (everything was close by). It has some of the best water views in all of Vancouver. But it's overpriced. We had 3 days planned (party of 5), we paid $600 for a suite (separate room king bed and living area and sofabed) with tax over $700+. We were so disappointed we left first thing in the morning (after reaching 1AM at night and 12 hours of flying). The room was crowded, city view, and the furnishings were AVERAGE. I couldn't believe the price we paid, and the service was not anything even CLOSE to 5 star. I was told these same rooms can go over only a couple hundred dollars, but there were TWO conventions going on, and a bunch of cruise ships in port. We jumped over the the Renaissance down the road, got TWO connected rooms and still was less than HALF the stupid suite we paid (FOR TWO ROOMS!). Also had perfect gorgeous view, 100 times better view than City view in Pan Pacific. Renaissance is not a luxury hotel, but was fine, price was so much better. Pan Pacific's location is both a pro and a con. It's a signature hotel for Vancouver. it's right on the water and literally attached to the cruise ship port. If you are on a cruise ship it's fantastic. You walk off the boat and take a couple steps and check into the hotel. The convention center is also a few steps away. But this leads to a CONSTANTLY PACKED hotel. You just aren't going to get top service with that scenario. It's crowded like mad with all the guest shuffling in and out of the cruise ships. DO NOT EXPECT OR PAY FOR 5 star service. Also annoying internet was not complimentary it was something like $20-30 a day, parking was extremely expensive too. If you are not leaving downtown, cabs and walking are a better option. At one point we needed a wheelchair and that took forever, because it seems like they only have ONE, and they can never find it (even though we called twice ahead of time saying we need it before we go). On our second stint back to Vancouver a manager got us a room, it was MUCH bigger. While it was one room it was oversized, so it was TWO double beds and had plenty of room for a rollaway. Had an amazing view of the harbour, and it was wide open and spacious for $250-$300. It was LESS THAN HALF the cost of a suite but so much better than that terrible suite.

The hotel's room service was quick and delicious. The morning buffet was convenient if a little pricey ($25 for cold buffet/$29 with eggs and pancakes). However, we received a $25 restuarant credit when booking directly with the hotel. The room was spotless, spacious and had a great view. Staff was friendly and very informative.

I actually got the hotel at a reasonable price through the blind-purchase off of hotwire, when I found out I'd got a room at the Pan Pacific (already knowing the prominent location), I was very pleased. Despite sitting on the lower end of the reservation totem pole (as all of use who use hotwire/priceline/etc tend to be), they gave me a nice room on a higher level. The rooms are either bay or city view --with the bay being more desirable (you get the tremendous views of the water and North Vancouver). They gave us the city side, which wasn't bad at all --the sight lines from all the rooms are good; there's no building that's sitting point-blank right in front so you can see a good chunk of the expansive, modern glass skyline that's erupted in this city over the last decade. Besides, you can get excellent views of the bay from the lobby, the various restaurants, or just walking on the deck of the connected Canada Place. The room itself was well appointed --it was an oddly shaped room, which made it spacious with plenty of large windows, a couch, a large bathroom, large flat-screen TV, a very comfy bed and everything was clean. It was the sort of room that cheers you up when you enter it. Since this hotel fights to be a five star, it had robes, plenty of good bath products, and an umbrella for use during the stay (we didn't need it, thankfully). They have the option of delivering a variety of pillows to your room, we chose the temperpedic, and they were delivered very quickly --a big plus as it was later in the evening. The facilities are what you'd expect: the hotel is attached to the original convention center (itself built for the Canadian pavilion of 1986 World Expo, which I attended), as well as a major cruise ship dock. Parking prices are fairly high, but reasonable for a downtown hotel of this caliber. There is a spa, but my companion was unable to use it as it opened a little later than we could fit into our busy schedule (we only stayed for a night). The gym is located adjacent to the hotel, and has a good spread of cardio and weight equipment. I do serious weight routines, and I found the equipment present to be adequate for a full body workout (though it requires knowledge of how to make best use of the various pulley systems). The view from the treadmills is a nice view across the water to Stanley Park. We tried the hotel's resident fine dining restaurant, Five Sails (named after the roof of Canada Place), it was very good. Pricey, of course, but the food matched the excellent view. The front desk was very helpful in getting us a reservation (at the window!) as we checked in. The hotel's service was top-notch, everyone from the door man to the front desk to house keeping was on the ball. Finally, the location is absolutely great --its a short-to-reasonable walk to all the major neighborhoods around downtown Vancouver. We were able to do a one day intensive walk-through without any trouble. And the ability to walk along the harbor in the evening or early morning is a big plus. The new convention center is right next door. This hotel still has the most prominent location in the city. Overall I highly recommend this hotel, especially if you can snag it using one of the discount travel sites.", "Date": "June 13, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Montreal", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful, relaxing, breathtaking ahhhhhhh :)\u201d", "Author": "VanillaBreeze", "ReviewID": "UR29702599", "Content": "I stayed at the Hotel Pan Pacific in downtown Vancouver for a vacation booked to forget about the stresses of the moment.

Service was excellent, the location very convenient, close to Stanley Park , to a bike rental, to the cruise harbour, to the seabus to North Vancouver, gastown, chinatown etc, and the building is connected to a foodcourt which offers several good choices if you find the 30$ can for breakfast too expensive. The food I ordered through roomservice was very good though (vegetables and a nice risotto). Regarding roomservice; a bit ridicilous is the 4 dollar charge (besides the 17% gratuity) for everything over 10 dollars, as almost all dishes were over 10 dollars! I loved the mats in the elevator, that told you which day it was (as a tourist you can lose track of days ;-), the pool was long enough to do laps (17 m according to an employee) and although it is an outdoor pool, it was warm enough to swim in (no cold shock getting in). About the room; room 1828, harbour view, 2 queen beds, good quality, loved the lamp on the desk that had extra sockets in it to plug in computer etc, so no crawling under a desk looking for a socket. I believed that internet was dsl only, and there is an extra charge for it. The view from the room was the fantastic, everyday you could see cruise ships come into the harbour and moor next to the hotel. Also waterplanes were flying in and out (there is a small waterplane terminal close to the hotel). And I must say: usually I do not care much for the shampoo + conditioner supplied by hotels, but I really liked the brand the Pan Pacific is using (Aveda). drawbacks; the interior of the room is a little bland/understated. The bath does not have a detachable shower (but this is something I have seen in most hotels in countries with a british background), and the bath is really low. With 1.80m (5 ft, 6 inc) you can not properly soak!. There was a giant flatscreen tv in the room, but the picture was very grainy, which ruined the effect. I reported the problem, but apparently it could not be fixed. When I made the reservation the booking was made for a king size, when I arrived there were no king sizes and I got room with 2 queen size beds. Not a problem for me, but why offer a king size if it is not available? These things should not withold you from booking the pan pacific though; the views and location make up for it. Be aware of one thing though if noise is an issue for you; a new convention center is being build next door, see on of the photo's added, the building with the green roof.. According to an employee the noise should not be a problem, as they are mainly working inside the new building now. And the hotel is quite soundproof. I was there over the weekend, so I could not tell. The hotel was also upgrading some suites in the hotel, and on Monday , there were some drillings sound. So you may want to check before booking. Be aware though that in light of the Olympics 2010 there is construction going on all over Vancouver.", "Date": "September 17, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego, California", "Title": "\u201cElegants above the cruise terminal\u201d", "Author": "Walker S", "ReviewID": "UR20126618", "Content": "Our tour included an overnight stay at this spectacular hotel prior to departing on our cruise the next day.

Our original choice of hotel that we'd stayed at before now seems to be blighted by the building work going on in Vancouver so we changed. We arrived at the hotel at 9am after saying good bye to the Diamond Priincess (a wonderful cruise). The walk from the ship through security into the hotel reception took about 10 minutes. First impressions are always important and the greeting we got at reception was spot on. We expected to just drop our bags and return at 4pm however I left my mobile number and was told I'd get a call as soon as out room was ready. True to their word I got a call at 10:15 to say our room was ready and our luggauge was waiting. Now that's good. We'd splashed out a bit and got a room with views over the harbour, mountains, Stanley park, lion gate bridge. The room was nice and high on the 21st floor, nicely appointed with everything we needed. We could just watch the world go by from our room. I'd guess if your in the lower floors you might see a bit more of the cruise ships when they are moored up. There is an outside terrace in the main reception and a pool on the 8th. We didn't use the pool but the seating area was handy. We had breakfast once in the hotel which was nice but $60 for two. We ate twice in the 5 sails restaruant, My Wife just adored the fish courses, worth every penny. Laundry service was quick, out and back in 4 hours, infact the service was good all round.

Our family checked in on the afternoon of August 17, 2008 and decided to go for a swim. After using the pool (which was lovely) I took my 3month old son back to the room for a bath and when I used one of the towels to dry him, I noticed that there was blood on it. I was pretty freaked out and thought that he was hurt. It turns out the blood was on the towel itself. I called the duty manager immediately and she asked me what I would like to do. How about CHANGE THE TOWELS? I couldn't believe that she waited for me to give the instructions! After an upsetting night wondering about where the blood came from and what else is contaminated in the room, I called the duty manager again at 8am the next morning. I told her that we would like to check out today (we had two rooms booked for two nights). The duty manager asked me why and I explained that I can't get over the towel with blood on it. She asked me a lot of questions about it because she says the duty manager from the previous day did not log the issue. I gave her all the information and told her that I took a picture of it as well. The duty manager offered to have us switch rooms, but when I told her we had two rooms, she did not say anything about it anymore. I declined the offer and quickly looked for another hotel in Vancouver. When we checked out, I showed Akiko, the duty manager, the pictures of the towel (she requested to see the pictures) and she just shrugged and said, \"Ooh...I'm so sorry,\" and walked away. That was the end of it. We moved to the Fairmont, which was much CLEANER. Now that I look back, it wasn't the blood on the towel that I find disturbing, it was the attitude and service provided by the Pan Pacific. The first duty manager didn't even offer to have the towels changed, I had to request it. The second duty manager tried to erase the issue with a casual \"So sorry.\" This is supposed to be a prestigious hotel, but if the duty mangers, who are supposed to be in charge, have such laxed attitudes about hygiene and customer support, how can they possible lead the rest of the staff? Akiko could have easily turned the situation around by offering to investigate the issue and offer an explanation (my guess is that someome cut their hand and then handled the towels - there was too much blood for it to be a minor cut and the blood was not dried or old looking) via a follow-up.

The staff are great. We emailed earlier for a high floor and king-sized bed and all our requests were met. (We got the 16th floor and view of Stanley park) Our 5 night stay earned us a bonus C$75 credit which could be used for internet, meals, etc. The room cost an average of C$300 per nite, excluding taxes. Expensive yes, but worth it esp if you are celebrating a special occasion and wld like somewhere really special. The location is very central - just 2 minutes away from Waterfront Seabus and Skytrain station. There's a stop for the BIG BUS and Trolley Bus tours o/s the hotel. The view is simply breath-taking - Stanley Park, Grouse Mountain, Northshore and everyday we see the sea planes landing there. The cruise ships didn't bother us much - they \"horn\" upon arrival but the time is always during waking hours and we didn't bump into any crowds of people landing / boarding the cruise ships. In fact we liked the view of the cruise ships coming in. Also walking distance (about 30 min) to Boat Cruises and marina where you can take boat tours. We took the Boat Cruise Also 1min away from taxis, Aqua Riva restaurant (excellent pan seared duck there!) and about 10 min away from Robson St. Besides the great location and view, the service was excellent too. COunter staff were very friendly and helpful. We had a choice of 5 types of pillows which is great cos' I didn't have to miss my Tempur orthopedic pillow!! The restaurants there are good too. Cafe Pacifica offers an excellent angel hair pasta with scallops. Don't bother with the seafood sampler though - it's expensive and the portions are so small. When we needed anything (eg missing newspaper for just 1 day, needed a kettle and of course, request for pillows), just a call and the staff were quite prompt to respond. In all, worth every cent we paid. No doubt the hotel is relatively expensive and mini bar items are exhorbitant but the free gourmet coffee, excellent view, service and location, etc, make up for it.

After our cruise we returned to the Pan Pacific, they had overbooked and we were asked if we were interested in going to the Fairmont Waterfront on them for the night. Since we had just gotten our on ship bill we happily went across the street. When looking on-line the Fairmont was much more expensive. It was a very nice hotel but I liked the Pan Pacific a little better. When we went back to thePP we were given a deluxe harbor-view room. It was one of the most spacious and beautiful rooms we have ever stayed in. We also enjoyed the turn-down service. Unfortunately we were in Vancouver during the power outage. The PP had no power (or water on our floor) for two days. I think they went above and beyond trying to help everyone. They put out a free buffet with snacks and drinks ( best sweet tea I ever had!) The entire staff never lost their patience during this. Even our room and bathroom were cleaned even though housekeeping had to do it all in the dark. I was very impressed with this. We decided to change hotels and they were able to get us a room at the Westin Bayshore. We paid $225 at the PP (with a $25 internet credit) and the Westin was $209. As we were leaving the PP the man getting the cab for us could not have been nicer. He had been there since the morning, you could tell he was tired but he was SO NICE. He showed my daughters the clock that stopped at 10:16 and took a picture of them, he then RAN to get us a cab. I felt everyone at the PP were so nice and very professional. We then moved on to the Westin- what a difference. I found the staff to not be as nice and service was so slow. The room was below average at best. The wall paper was bubbling up, the carpet was stained and the lamp shade was frayed. The room also had a \"musty\" scent. The room was in need of a MAJOR renovation in my opinion. Also, the room had a harbor view in the tower section, it was a good 5 minute walk from the lobby. One time we waited over 5 minutes for someone to get us a cab. This room did not even come CLOSE to either thePP or the Fairmont, but the price was very close to what I paid at the PP. I was happy for electricity, but the room was a HUGE disappointment, plus I felt the staff had an attitude.

The bar area within the hotel though is a pleasant enough place to sit for a drink and the views of the harbour, surrounding mountains and Stanley Park are pretty good to say the least. Service was very swift with all staff very friendly and attentive. Our check out was a slightly different story. As our flight home was late afternoon we negotiated, without any trouble, a check out time of 3pm. We took a walk that morning only to arrive back at the hotel at lunchtime to find our room key had been de-activated. The duty manager came up to let us back in, after asking us for some ID.

The Pan Pacific is located right on Vancouver harbour, and is basically on top of the cruise ship terminal. It is a very big and impersonal hotel, but if you are an independant traveller and are happy to be left alone and blend into the background like we are, then this is a great hotel. It does get busy at times, especially when there is a cruise coming or going, but it isn't really a problem because of the size of the hotel. One thing I would recommend to anyone planning to stay there is do book a room with a view of the harbour and Stanley Park. It is better than any TV. We sat for ages watching what was going on, without realising how the time was passing. You have the ships coming and going, the seaplanes taking off and landing as well as the wonderful views of the park. The room was smaller than we have experienced at other hotels, but it was very clean and the bed was very comfortable, but those views certainly made up for it. We found the food to be very good, and as always in Canada, excellent value. We didn't bother with the fine dining restaurant as the bar or restaurant where you have breakfast (I can't remember its name) were both good. We booked a B & B package direct with the hotel, and this is a good idea, as you just hand over the little vouchers you receive on check in, to the restaurant host/hostess as you enter, and you can have as much as you want from the very good buffet, or you can pay a bit more and choose from the menu, but to be honest, alot of the food on the menu is in the buffet anyway, you just pay to have it delivered to your table. As I said at the beginning of this review, we had booked the first couple of nights of our stay at the Pan Pacific, and then we were moving on to the Wedgewood. Well, we did move on to the Wedgewood, and two nights later we came back to the Pan Pacific for the rest of our holiday. The Wedgewood is not a hotel I would recemmend to anyone. It is not in a very nice area to be in at night for one thing, and you can't get into the bar because of locals flocking in there after work. The food is also over priced and over rated. They think they are something special, but they're not! Anyway, I doubt I will return to Vancouver in the near future, as we had 11 days there, and thats quite a long time to spend in one city. However, if I do go back, I would have no hesitation in booking the Pan Pacific again. It is in a good location, and you can walk along the waterfront, all the way to Stanley Park. It is also ideally located for the downtown shops.

Another great feature of the hotel is that you can call down and have a bellhop come up to your room and automatically have your luggage transfered to the the ship.

Most areas are accessible by elevator, though because the parking garage elevators stop at 10pm, if you arrive later, it could be a challenge.

I found a fabulous rate advertised on Travel Zoo, and to my surprise, when I called the hotel to book the discounted web rate they actually had rooms available and were more than pleasant about booking them for me. Upon arrival I half expected to be treated like a second class citizen as we were paying less than half the regular room rate. Not so. We were greeted with enthusiasm and shown to a exceptionally nice room. The staff at this hotel were professional, helpful and always smiling. I don't believe you can get a room with bad view in this hotel. Half the rooms face the harbor and the other face the city. We had city view rooms and enjoyed people watching from our windows as well as the twinkling lights at night. The new convention center is being built next door, which was fascinating to watch and noise was not an issue. Our windows actually opened for fresh air - a real plus in my book. The pool and jacuzzi deck on the 8th floor was well planned with attractive landscaping. Rooms were large with comfortable furniture. Marble bathroom was tastefully decorated with lux towels and amenities. Bed sheets were sensational - better even then Westin's 'heavenly bed' - felt more like silk than cotton. I expected this to be a large impersonal convention hotel. I was way off the mark. It's one of the nicest properties I've stayed in. It has an ideal location for anyone taking a cruise out of Vancouver - you can walk your luggage right on and off the boat. We walked right by several hundred people waiting in line for cabs and transfers and were in our room within 10 minutes from exiting the ship.

So if you are looking for quick service at reception or your car from valet parking quickly, forget it. Apart from that, the rooms are comfortable, clean, quiet and many with good views. Couple of tips - If your room rate includes parking, don't think a $5 tip to the concierge will get your car out of the carpark. You will find a $28 per day charge on your bill. Don't also ask for two apples from the staff making up the restaurant for breakfast, at 9pm after seeing the sights. That will cost you $10. Overall a fair - good hotel that has some flaws.

My objection was that there was no turn down service in the evening. The beds were made each morning, but the finishing pillows sat on the floor for the entire 4 day stay. There was a shortage of towels. We also had a sofa bed that was used each night. It was never closed in the morning as part of daily housekeeping. My real surprise at the lack of service was that the business service center charged $7 per 20 minutes to use the internet. I asked the concierge to please print out our boarding passes. He told me to go to the business center. I said that the recent hotels I stayed in, both in the US and Europe, printed out our boarding passes for us. I did not think that I should have to pay $7 to get our passes. I know of a Holiday Inn in LA where the computer for boarding passes is in the lobby and anyone, both in the hotel and off the street, can use it - free! (Hardly a 5 star hotel.) The concierge refused to help. I reluctantly went to the business center, was charged $7 only to find out that internation boarding passes from Vancouver are not available on line. I think the concierge should have known this. I did not have time to continue my complaint to the manager, as I needed to get to the airport. This was my first time staying at a Pan Pacific. If this is what they think is 5 star service, I will choose another hotel. We previously stayed at the Fairmont Waterfront across the street (twice).

(2) Get the bus out to Granville Island, its worth it just for the market. (3) Watch how far you wander around Gastown.

The king bed was heavenly and extremely comfortable. I loved the 8th floor pool and hot tub deck. The view was nice and the hot tub was very relaxing late in the evening. I had a wonderful massage in the hotel spa! Tori, the massage therapist was terrific and took all the pain out of my back, shoulders and neck. The space is very relaxing and beautiful. We tried so many wonderful restaurants while in town, so I don't have much to say about the hotel's food, other than the lunch day one on the outdoor patio was delicious and a late evening dessert on the same patio was equally tasty.

Having visited the city several times, I brought my wife along so she could experience all the city has to offer. We read the tripadvisor.com reviews before our trip, and based on the up and down reviews for this place, well, we were a bit nervous about it all, mainly because I had prepaid five nights. On arrival the location was perfect and the prepaid internet stay booked through the hotel website allowed for a great rate and a harborview room - no upgrades. As a very frequent business traveller, 7 years at approx 200 hotel nights a year - this hotel met or exceeded our expectations on all accounts. I have stayed at fancy waterside hotels in Barcelona, Boston, Norfolk, VA, Freeport and Nassau Bahamas, Antigua, Nice France, Cannes and elsewhere and this place was just fine and dandy. The room was quiet - and yes we were on the seaplane side, the climate control worked just fine - cold for sleeping, heat when wanted, the water was hot and plentiful - not a hint of brown, the bed perfect, room service breakfast prompt and among the best tasting I have had, the valet service prompt and personable, the check in rapid and pleasant and the maid service just great. The internet hooked up easily - with even the cable provided in the desk. The pool, while out of commission for spring cleaning, was restored and heated by the time we got around to using it. We really asked ourselves why the other reviews had negatives, and vowed to write our review in reply. My wife tried the spa to her great delight and I got to use the nearby - perhaps 2 minutes by foot - SeaBus to my work in North Vancouver, across the bay. In the mornings we were up and to our delight watched the seaplanes (these fun planes starting at 7am, all stopped by dark) taxi and take off at our feet, and we saw cruise ships on four days pull up and depart below our windows. It was fascinating to see, and we just stared out the windows in amazement from 630 to 730 am each morning, thinking about which seaplane was going where, how they would take off or land and such. Yes, you can hear them, but they are not loud enough to make you get up from bed ifr you are in it, or feel discomfited - and I am definitely a \"noise fussy\" traveller. We did not eat at any hotel restaurant because of all the fabulous restaurants within walking or taxi distance, (Carderos, Sand Bar, Tojo, Yoshis) so we cannot say how the hotel restaurant service or food might be. My wife walked to the Vancouver Harbor seaplane terminal and took a day trip to Victoria via seaplane - something she enjoyed immensely. Several days she took in the city on foot, by taxi and by organized tour. We were so taken in by the view and activity that we did not turn on the TV all week, so I do not know how that works at this hotel. Now, for the budget traveller, set your sights somewhere else. Yes, the car parking in downtown Vancouver at the very edge of the water under the hotel is spendy, and yes internet is charged and all the extras cost plenty too. So pry open that wallet if you expect the amenities this place has to offer. We spent $1900 US all in for five nights, including room, considerable taxes, valet parking, laundry four days, internet all five nights, room service, medium minibar consumption and gratuities. I travel well, and do not skimp, but my taste also runs to lower tier chain hotels if that is what suits. This same trip we stayed at a Hampton Inn for 2 nights and were plenty happy there too. Based on my travels, the cost of staying at a hotel like this is expensive, no matter what the city - and most hotels do not share such a fabulous location. I say if you can get a good rate, it is value for money. We say this hotel rated 4 and 1/2 stars, not five, but not four either. In most cases you will not need a car in Vancouver, taxis and metro transport are everywhere, so I will not rent one on our next trip - and save on the parking. I say do not bother with the non-waterview rooms at this hotel. The location is so fabulous that not having a waterview room is an automatic let down - unless the rate is so low as to compare favorably with an inland location......... I suggest specifying a room that faces Stanley Park and the seaplanes for best entertainment and views - short of a harbor \"end suite\" that we did not flake out for - There are non-agressive panhandlers in the area across the street, (and many areas of Vancouver) so best walk down the east side of the hotel or along the water side of the street to avoid them if so inclined. There is plenty of activity in this area day and night so we did not feel threatened in any way, but they are there. There is construction on the west side of the hotel that requires use of a sidewalk bypass, but the convention center expansion is low enough that it does not impede the hotel room views, and while we did not hear a single noise coming from it day or night, it remained fascinating to inspect from our room while munching breakfast or sipping wine .............. we pulled the chairs right to the window every morning and night. Try the outdoor heated hot tub. They keep the towels right there and there are changing rooms on the same floor. You will need a room key to access it. We loved it and stayed in it for over an hour, even while it rained on us ! There is general madness on the sidewalk in front of the hotel when the cruise ships are changing passengers, but it is to be expected, and we just scheduled ourselves to avoid the crowds. This heavy activity was not felt or sensed in the hotel by us - but I had to walk thru crowds on 2 occaisions and the Saturday check out while very fast at the front desk, was a challenge at the curbside where they (promptly) brought our car around to. For dissatisfied travellers, such as those with brown water or otherwise defective rooms, I say do not tolerate it in any hotel..If no joy at the hotel, check out and tell your credit card provider it was absolutely unsatisfactory for a rebate ............. and write tripadvisor !", "Date": "May 23, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego, California", "Title": "\u201cThe Best Hotel in Vancouver\u201d", "Author": "CareyBerry", "ReviewID": "UR7641640", "Content": "My friend and I arrived in Vancouver from a Holland America Cruise and spent two days in Vancouver on business.

The room was gorgeous (clean and lovely), but I'm tool old to be sleeping on a sleeper sofa. It just wasn't comfortable. My husband and son ended up on it and seemed to sleep well. The rollaway wasn't just a foldabed, it was more like a dorm bed, it was much better, and I slept fairly well, but it was like sleeping on a floor and I know that some people have a very difficult time with super super hard beds (which this one was).

The first night, they assured us it was allergy free, and I woke up in the middle of the night with horrible allergies. Turned out it was a down blanket. I wrote a note to the front desk, as well as to the housekeeping service and when we got back that night, the down blanket was still/back on the bed! We had to call housekeeping again to change linens (andm of course, tip again). Also, for the first two days, the shower would suddenly spurt out dark brown water, replete with vegetable matter. We called them the first day, and it happened again the next day. We're not talking a little rust in the pipes. We are talking nasty, nasty dark brown water with bits in it. Fairly repulsive. It was apparently an issue with the storms, but it was just gross. They suggested it might be because we were the last room in the building. Whatever it was, it was disgusting. Wireless internet is $14.95 for 24 hrs. It just seemed that it should have free wireless, at the least. This was the worst: Parking was $27 a day, which translated into $141, which was more than we paid for the rental car (which we booked through priceline for $120 for the week!). Each day, they would add bottles of Nestle Pure Life, in addition to the $5 bottles of Fiji. We never drank the Pure Life, which just piled up in the room, and just as we suspected, they cost $$ too (we finally called to ask) --- this link above shows our exact room (but the bedroom doors were always closed, because they belonged to other guests).

This hotel may technically be 4.5 or 5 stars due to the facilities available but it was far from top quality. This hotel is typical of a corporate convention center. Check in was a painful fiasco. First we had to wait in a painfully slow line up for 15+ minutes to check in, my wife went to the concierge to complain and asked to pay extra to get checked in right away but he looked at her like she was from Mars. We then walked in to an already occupied room, luckily it was my wife\u2019s Mothers room and she and her new husband were dressed! Our key over rode their room key so now their keys no longer worked. After a lengthy wait on hold and a 10-minute wait for a call back and 15 minutes for new keys to arrive, they finally had everything straightened out. They blamed the computer system. Our room was large and appeared clean but had a musty smell. The bathroom was clean and nice with good quality toiletries and a good shower. The furnishings were hap-hazard and not really well done at all (fake brass coffee table, yuck), it could have been so much better with all the space they had to work with. The coffee maker is in the bathroom, which I hate, and the coffee condiments and supplies are 20 feet away in a dark cubbyhole under the TV, with no place nearby for the garbage. Not very well though out at all. There was a large desk with lots of space around it so it is set up well for business. We had adjoining doors to the room next door which was occupied by a family that believed children should be heard at all times and they kept it up continuously, we were woken up at 7am by screaming kids. We were relieved when they went out for an hour for breakfast. You can literally hear every word through the doors. Ask about construction noise if you plan on sleeping in, the convention center expansion is underway, other people we new in the hotel complained to us about this also. We paid $130 + taxes =$150 so we got what we paid for. You can easily get a much better room and service in Vancouver for $160+.

There was no noticeable noise from the nearby convention centre construction site (which I had been warned might be the case). Whilst the staff were friendly, it is (as others have said) a vast and impersonal hotel that plays host to large parties of people arriving off the many cruise ships that dock outside. Nothing wrong with that per se, but it is rather disorientating to walk into a hotel only to find that the ground floor is one vast space with nowhere to check in (you have to go up two escalators before you get to the hotel level proper). On the plus side (particularly for tourists (as I was)), it does have the benefit of having a National/Alamo car rental desk on the ground floor. On balance eating at the hotel was rather disappointing. I ate twice in the flagship restaurant \"Five Sails\". The food was uniformly excellent (as it ought to be at the price) but sadly the service on the second occasion was so woeful as to ruin the experience (50 minutes passed from ordering before my first course arrived). They had a function in their private dining room and clearly didn't have enough staff to cope both with this and the other diners - far from the AAA Five Diamond Award experience proclaimed on their website. Eating once in the hotel bar was also a mistake - a very mediocre club sandwich.

Decided to stay with the city view as we were a little concerned about noise from the construction of the new convention center mentioned in other reviews. Didn't hear a thing. I requested a room on a higher floor with a king bed before we arrived. No problems...great customer service both on the phone and at the hotel. The newly renovated rooms are quite nice. The bed was extremely comfortable. Valet Parking (27CAD per day) was always efficient. The self park option is 20CAD. Make sure you check out the outdoor jacuzzi and pool...great views. Didn't have the time to try out the restaurants and spa facilities. We would definately stay here again although next time we are planning to give the Westin Bayshore a try.", "Date": "March 9, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Montreal, Canada", "Title": "\u201cAwesome Hotel Pan Pacific\u201d", "Author": "bh7h", "ReviewID": "UR4390058", "Content": "It has been a pleasure once more to stay at this hotel.

If you get the chance pop over to the Fairmont to see their resident dog Holly, she works at the hotel from 8am to 5pm.

The location is ideal. The rooms are very comfortable. Disappointing when I arrived at midnight on September 15 to find that the room I had booked was given away (a group overstayed their plans was the excuse.) Luckily, I got a room in a lower category (with no rate differential offered) and was told I could change the next day. (I did not bother.) The lobby is always a zoo in the daytime with meeting attendees and cruise ship passengers. Sometimes the 4 hotel elevators were not enough for all of the guest movements and you had to let them pass by a few times. Bad luck for me as my forced downgrade was to the 10th floor (guest rooms start on 8) which means elevators were often full when they reached my floor. Other than that, I liked the hotel for its location and comfort. I was disappointed to often seeing guests checking in at 8:30 am and getting their every wish (mountain view high floor and 2 oversized queen beds) when they paid the cheapest rates. I guess that is what happened to my room - it was given to a discounted rate guest and not held for me (despite Amex prepayment) for my late arrival. I had breakfast in the buffet restaurant on September 18 and was very disappointed. Food and variety was good. Hostess was pleasant but service was surly at best. After being seated by the hosted and being ignored by passing waiters (and the restaurant was not full) for 15 minutes, I got my food. Then, I spotted the hostess and asked her to send a waiter to my table to offer coffee. The waiter's belated greeting was NOT \"good morning, would you like coffee\". It was \"do you have breakfast vouchers\". I did not as I was not on a cheap package. Then, another waiter came and asked if I wanted two checks for breafkast or one and I replied one. I returned to the buffet and saw the check sitting there and ignored it. The 2nd waiter returned again and told me the check was there and noted I had not signed it. I told him I would do so when I finished eating. I was holding a fork and had no place in my fingers for a pen. He replied \"at your convenience I see\". I do not know what he meant - I normally sign or pay the check in restaurants when I finish, not as I am eating. For C$60 for two, the waiters should be taught a lesson in basic manners. I completed the hotel comment card which had noplace to rate the restaurants and filled in my view of the bad service on the card. I have to say the rude lack of attention really annoyed me and did not let me enjoy my breakfast. The other two mornings I went to Starbuck's as I was not hungry and got much better service - thank you and good morning - the real basics. Luckily, I only had two glasses of wine on Saturday evening in the hotel bar overlooking the harbor (my downgrade did not afford me this view that I had paid for) and limited my contact with the hotel's rude F&B department. The F&B department was busy though. On Friday night, the President of China was there for a banquet and the streets in front of the hotel and the hotel entry were filled with protestors. Some were banging drums to make themselves heard, which did not bug me that much, but I am sure irritated other guests. Had I gotten the room I reserved and prepaid for and had I been treated with minimal courtesy in the hotel restaurant, I would have listed the hotel as Above Average.", "Date": "September 19, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Shrewsbury, MA", "Title": "\u201cNice Hotel, Good Location\u201d", "Author": "CosmoKitty24", "ReviewID": "UR3912205", "Content": "We recently stayed at the Pan Pacific Vancouver and were very pleased with the Hotel. We thought the location was very convenient for getting around the and seeing the city. The level of service was superior, the food was very good, but be warned you do pay for EVERYTHING when staying at this hotel, including a $3.95 delivery charge for room service, which we found a little rediculous. The pool and fitness areas are very nice and what you would expect from a 5 star hotel. The hotel is located at the Canada Place Convention Center so it is in a busy location, but is within walking distance of most of the city's attaction, including Stanley Park and Gastown. One note there is loads of contruction in and around Vancouver in preparation for the 2010 Olympics, this includes the convention center, the piledriving starts around 7 am and doesn't stop until 5, so right now I would opt for the City view room vs. the Harbor view to cut down on the noise.
