However we had booked another twin room for 1 person also \u00c2\u00a390 with breakfast (only option left as hotel fully booked) this was definitely not worth paying. My guess is the put the prices up because of the football. 1st impression the Foyer was lovely was well thought out comfortable chairs, Tv, Internet access, dining area looked really nice aswell, Clean. Staff- some was really helpful, Some need to get some manners and customer service skills. My 1st impression soon disappeared, walked along the corridor and there was an awful smell, still don't quiet know how to describe it other than sewage or dirty pipes or something, was awful luckily the smell did not continue into the rooms but the corridors looked like needed a good hoover. Rooms- the beds was comfortable, the TV was temperamental, the room was a little small for a twin room, tea and coffee making facilities, Wardrobe and Chester draws available to use. However the door did not lock, and even though could only be opened from the outside, if you had a key (which obviously hotel staff did have ) i did not feel very secure, being Female and i had made the booking, it was not acceptable, luckily was only staying for 1 night, and sharing a room with my father , but i still didn't feel secure so when went to sleep i put our luggage and a chair up against the door. You shouldn't have to do this when staying at a hotel. The other twin room booked, the hotel would not know the other room was male or female in the room as the don't ask for details for this when making the booking or even checking in, if it was a sole Female i would not of felt secure, however it was male in the 2nd room. The bathroom - when i opened the door, i laughed the toilet was 1 foot off the ground, i'm a short lady but my father is a big guy, and this was ridiculous. Luckily we were out for most of the day and night, but was an issue the next morning when we needed to use it, probably a little easier for guys to use than for females. Bathroom was small, didn't look clean, shower was reasonable, but i even banged my head on the railing over the sink when was brushing my teeth the next morning. oh and one of tiles came off aswell. Breakfast- Continental provided, reasonable, eat as much as you like, Orange and Apple juice, Tea and coffee. If the hotel but as much effort as they obviously had in the reception area and the dining area, into the rooms, or definitely into the bathrooms this hotel would be great. Was ok for 1 night because of location and being ideal of where we needed to be for the weekend great, would not stay more than 1 night. Would i recommend it? - probably not. Would i stay there again? Only if i was staying with males in the same room, and it was the last option (maybe not even then).

When we arrived, there was some confusion with the room keys, and which rooms boys and girls were in. My room was on the top floor, and after climbing 3 normal-sized flights of stairs (with my suitcase) i encountered a very narrow, almost spiral staircase. My friend's bag (thankfully not mine) got stuck in the stairwell (that's how narrow it was!), and she needed help to unstick it. After finally getting to our room, we opened the door to find that the room smelled very strongly of sewage, even with the window wide open! We waited, hoping the smell would go away. It didn't. My roommates and I were disgusted with this. I swapped rooms with another girl, however there were still three people staying the night in there. Thankfully my new room was just down the hall. This room didn't smell like sewage, thank goodness! However, the bathroom did smell strongly like moldy pipes, which, after a hot shower, made it almost unbearable in that tiny bathroom! Room was also dirty, and although the furnishings were new, the window was old (i'm talking wooden, single pane) and the curtains were ripped and had stains that looked suspiciously like blood! My roommates and I felt the need to do a bedbug check, and although we didn't find any, in my opinion you shouldn't feel like you have to check for bedbugs at the hotel you're staying at! Breakfast was nothing but toast and jam! I do understand that European meals are different from North America, but really? Just toast, and orange juice. I can't go until lunch on two pieces of bread. As far as the thefts i've been reading about, nothing was taken from our room, and we did have to leave our bags behind the reception the second day, so that when we returned to the hotel we could simply put them on the coach and go. On the second night, the three girls in the room with the sewage smell were moved, much to their relief. The hotel did acknowledge that there was a problem, and said that it would be fixed the next day. (I never went back there so i'm not sure if it was actually fixed. Overall, do not stay at this hotel unless you are on a very tight budget, have a good lock on your bag, and don't mind dirt and smelly rooms!

We checked in on the 17th of december. The lady at the desk who checked us in was very kind (Katrina). She asked for the payment for the whole stay in advance. She guaranteed us that since we were private clients our rooms across the road were very nice. We booked for my self, my husbandand and my son (21 months old child) a double room, and a triple for my sister her husband and her daughter. As soon as the rooms were shown to us I was kind of shocked (room number 1 and room number 10). The rooms were dirty and my bathroom was really small and most important without heating. My family and I decided to talk to the lady the morning after since we all were very tired. The 18th of december, we went to Katrina informing her that we were disappointed. She offered another room inside the building where we checked in , but the room that was showed to us was even more dirty that our rooms. At this point Katerina suggested us to pack our lugguge and place it in my sister's room so when we would come back from the city a new room with a bigger and warm bathroom would be given to us. That never happened. We came back and the person at the reception was never informed that our room had to be changed. We decided to take our old room since my son was tired and since no other option was given. As soon as we entered the rooms we immediately realized that it was freezing! The heating this time was not working at all! The gentleman at the recption told us that the maintenance person would come after midnight to fix the problem. We all waited in the lobby since our rooms were too cold. My son since it was so late (past midnight) started crying very loudly in the lobby. The getleman at the desk offered us his electric heater and escorted us to the rooms. We decided to sleep all together in room numer 1 since my room number ten was freezing and we could not use our bathroom in room number ten. The 19th of december after spending a sleepless night we went to the front desk to speak to a manger regarding our problem. Noone was available and we were actually asked to bring back the electrical heater since the reception area was cold!!! At this point we really wanted to be refund and leave. We were asked to pack all our lugguge since later some rooms would become available. Later in the evening they told us that the heating problem was fixed and that we could check in back to our old rooms. I refused to go to room number ten since the bathroom was cold. I was offered room number 3. The shower in this new room was full of mould, dust everywhere. The best thing though is that the heating was not working again after one hour!!! On monday we finally managed to talk to Mr. Perigleous Andreas (manager). My husband and I (after 3 days of packing and unpacking, sleepless nights for how freezing the rooms were) asked for a refund. Mr. Perigleous informed us that no heating problem was reported. He asked us to come back later since he wanted to provide to fix this issue. He said that was his priority! At 05.30 pm we were in the lobby waiting for him to speak to us about the refund. After 40 minutes he walked outside the hotel and received us by the front door. My husband and I found that very odd. He tried remembering our issue since he stated he was very tired since he worked all day. He asked us if we came often to the UK cause next time we could stay for free one night at his hotel!!!! At this point I truly did not want to believe what he said! I replied that we expected to be refund since we could not shower once in our room (we used the entire stay my sister's bathroom in room number one), we froze for two nights infact my son got sick...and that his offer was truly unacceptable! While I was explaining him my point of view he walked away leaving me in the middle of the street, stating I was not being reasanable and that it was not true that the heating was not working since his stuff did not inform him! I did not know what to do. I called the police and they kindly told me that they could not help us. So basically we were robbed and could not be helped by anyone! I truly cannot describe the sense of frustration and disappointment we all felt. This hotel experience ruined completely our stay in London. I worked for ten years in the hotel business and never in my life I faced such a situation. Noone apologized. Noone offered a refund. The cherry on the cake? This morning (21st of december) the water in the shower was cold so we could not use it before getting on the plane. I cannot believe that in a country like England a tourist has no rights.

The Main Building is the one that has the Reception and the Breakfast Room where Breakfast is served every day for all the clients of the Hotel .

The Rooms in the Main Building have a nicer furniture , TV ( mine only got 2 Chanel but it was ok , the one in my Friend's room got 10 ) , a Tea maker with tea , coffee and Milk that are replaced every day if you use them , the Bathroom had shower but one of my friends had a big Bathtub . The nice Lady s come to clean your room every 2 days or so and they brig you new towels if you need them . The Breakfast is always the same , but it is good : cornflakes , milk , ham , cheese , butter and jam , bred , coffee and tea . In the Reception area you have FREE Wi -Fi so you can bring your Laptop with you , if you do not have it is ok there is also a Computer with printer there but it is with charge . In my opinion it is a Travel Budget hotel , ok only for young ppl or only persons traveling on budget . In my opinion the rooms in the Main Building are better than the ones in the other buildings , so if you book make sure that you specify that you what a room in the Main Building . The Metro Station - Finnsbury Park in very close - 5 min walk from the hotel and neat the Metro it is also a Buss Staion ( we used only Metro ) .

I admit that I sleep with ear plugs and eye mask wherever I go so I had no problems sleeping but my friend did say that folk were noisy when walking along the corridors in the wee hours of the morning. But that's to be expected in all hotels! Breakfast was fantastic for the money. There was choices of fresh orange and apple juice, 4 types of cereals, white and brown bread/ toast, jams, tea and coffee. It was buffet style so you could pretty much eat as much as you wanted, which was definitely taken up by the guy at the next table who had 6 rounds of toast and 4 bowls of cereal!! Everything was clean and well laid out in the breakfast room. All in all I was very impressed for the money. It isn't the Ritz but if you need a hotel with excellent location and you use it as somewhere to get your head down for a night or two I would highly recommend it!", "Date": "July 19, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Detroit", "Title": "\u201cGo here for location purposes only, it is good\u201d", "Author": "Eagle0077", "ReviewID": "UR70619492", "Content": "Small room, somewhat smudgy.

I had read all the reviews and i was terrified to be honest. Most of them seemed bad reviews and although i only wanted a place to sleep i didnt want it to be a depressing nightmare. When i got there the place was getting painted and the lift didnt work, so my first impression was reviews were correct. While waiting to check in i heard a couple saying to reception staff how they had stayed last year and liked it so were stying a week this time. This helped make me feel better as in no way would people come back if it wasnt ok, but then i wondered if they had struck lucky with a room. When i got to my room i was pleasantly surprised. The room was nice and bright and very pleasnt. It had a fridge, a kettle and also a toaster. The layout of the room was like a nice little cosy bedsit. Bathroom was small but not too small to be a problem. There was complimentary bodywash and towels were clean and in plenty. Breakfast was toast, jams, cheeses and cold meats, also cereal of cornflakes or museli. The drinks were tea, coffee or juices and although breakfast wasnt cooked there was plenty of it to fill up on. I stayed there 2 nights and my third night in London was a travelodge. I have used travelodge for yrs and i like the space and how the majority of travelodge tend to be clean, but this time in travelodge i was wishing i was back in this hotel as i prefered it better. Im going back to London in a few weeks and i will be staying in this hotel if it has a vacancy. so if i was happy there so will most people be, unless they are use to the hilton and by some of thr reviews im beginning to wonder if they used that hotel in comparrison.

There was no lock on the door, and no holder for the shower to go into. We complained to the receptionist, who rolled her eyes and pretty much looked at us in disgust, plain rude really.

The drawers in the room fell apart when we tried to put our stuff in them, but at least the TV worked. You were also only given 1 paper thin pillow each, which was quite uncomfortable. The continental breakfast was poor. We never went back after the first morning. All that was on offer was cardboard bread, weak diluting orange, cornflakes and jam. Go to one of the all day bakeries down the street instead (: The hotel was in a good location, in zone 2 of the underground, the nearest tube station (finsbury park) being a five minute walk away. You could also jump on and off the 29 bus right outside of the hotel, which took about 20 minutes to Leicester Square. I wouldn't reccomend walking alone late at night in this area though, it seems quite dodgy at times. The road outside the hotel was quite quiet, it is blocked off so not much traffic goes by.

My husband and I arrived at this hotel by hired car. The driver was doubtful that we had the address right and kept saying, \"Are you sure the hotel is in THIS neighborhood?\" The other nearby buildings had windows that were boarded up or hung with sheets. He literally seemed hesitant to drop us off. Not a good sign. Since this was our first trip to Europe, we thought maybe the outside was not indicative of the inside. Prepared to be good sports, we rolled our suitcases into the lobby. The receptionist was pleasant, but the desk/office area looked like a college dorm room - papers, magazines, boxes, etc. were strewn around. We checked in and went towards the elevator, only to be told that someone had recently broken it. I don't think so. Expect to carry your bags up and down the stairs. The stairs and hallway were carpeted and really dirty, like they hadn't been cleaned or even vacuumed for quite a while. We walked past an open door where clean sheets and towels were stacked on carpet that looked to be in the same condition. Our room was decent sized with a double bed. The furnishings were \"early IKEA\" but appeared clean. The bed had a flat sheet over the mattress, and a top sheet, comforter and towels were laid out on top of it. I guess the idea was that we were supposed to make it up. OK... There was a stand-alone closet and a little cupboard with a very small TV and a coffee maker on top. There was mold and water stains on the walls. The view out the window was of the parking lot, unless you looked the right and then you got a view of the dumpsters and someone's yard filled with trash. The television alternated between snowy color and snowy black and white. It got 6 channels, 4 of which were the same BBC station. The bathroom was huge, but mostly bare floor. The tub had a hand-held shower nozzle and hook for it on the wall that it didn't fit into. Our first realization that many Europeans take sit-down showers. We're not exactly old, but it wasn't all that easy getting in and out of this tub, and hard to avoid getting water on the floor. There were plastic packets (think ketchup) of soap and shampoo. The toilet was difficult to flush, especially if there was anything more than liquid in it (sorry.) My husband took to pouring water into the bowl from the tub to try to get it to flush. When he filled the sink with water to shave, it leaked at the bottom and made a pool on the floor around it. Maybe that's why there were no electrical outlets in the bathroom! There were 2 in the bedroom; one conveniently behind the bed, and the other on the wall outside the bathroom door. So much for actually seeing what you're doing if you try to use a dryer or curling iron. Speaking of which, we were surprised to find there was a not a dryer in the room when we had though the website said there was. My husband went online and found that there was a note saying you had to ask for one at the desk. Sure enough, one of the boxes back there was full of big black hair dryers. After having spent some time making the bed the first night (I know it's not a big deal but I was tired and a little cranky after traveling all day, and the bed wasn't all that easy to make since it was against the wall) I was disappointed to see that the next day we came back to find the same layout: bottom sheet on and folded top sheet, comforter and towels. The third day, we came back to find the comforter actually pulled up - yeah! Until I pulled it back to find the top sheet wadded up underneath it. Oh well. We appreciated the clean towels, and tried not to think about them being on the floor in the room down the hall. The breakfast was interesting. Again, we hadn't been to Europe before, so we were trying to go with the flow. What we were offered was two kind of bread and a toaster, jam and butter, a plate of sliced cheese (which we noticed most people piling on their toast in place of jam or butter,) muesli, milk, orange-colored water (Tang?), hot water with tea bags and packets of instant coffee. It wasn't bad, just somewhat unusual for us. We enjoyed the muesli and toast and went elsewhere to find coffee. We never did get used to the Nescafe. We found a treasure just down the street on our second night back: a Polish bakery with delicious pastries and such. We bought cinnamon rolls and blueberries at the market next door and ate like royalty the next morning. Finsbury Park, across the street, is a lovely little park and looked like it would be a nice place to jog (during the day.) There was a pair of swans and 6 cygnets in the pond that were delightful. This was rated a 3-star hotel on the TravelBound website. There is another hotel with the same name in a different part of London. Maybe it's nicer - we never went and checked. This one is way up north, and is a fair distance from Heathrow and the center of London, though there is a metro stop 3 blocks away that is convenient.
