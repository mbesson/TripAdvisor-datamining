Domus Australia means \"Australian home\", which is a very appropriate name for this accommodation centre in the heart of Rome. I stayed at Domus Australia in the week of Easter 2012 with my sister. On the standards of quality and service, Domus is outstanding. The rooms have a bright, modern design and a subtle Australian style is evident in the decor. There are four levels, accessible by stairs and an internal lift and many rooms overlook the courtyard, which provides a peaceful ambience at the centre of Domus. The chapel of St Peter Chanel adjoins the building and its interior also features some distinctly Australian adornments including a large painting of Australia's first saint, Saint Mary of the Cross. The tribute to pre-eminent members of the Australian church from Caroline Chisholm to Bishop Polding, is a theme of the names of rooms and sections of Domus; throughout the buidling there are images and information about their lives of service. The staff at Domus are very helpful and hospitable. The resources and assistance for guests ranges from phone calls and Internet access, to maps and guide sheets, train and bus information, and even useful Italian phrases. In addition to the comfort of the rooms and the service and quality breakfast in the dining room each morning, the warmth and friendliness of the staff and Rector at Domus left a lasting impression. I would highly recommend Domus Australia to anyone planning to stay in Rome. It provides an ideal way to explore and enjoy the magnificent basilicas and sights of the eternal city each day, and then return to an Australian home.", "Date": "April 16, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney, Australia", "Title": "\u201cTop notch\u201d", "Author": "Jim v", "ReviewID": "UR124313492", "Content": "Thank you for a great Rome experience. The team at Domus were extremely helpful and welcoming. After a full day out in Rome it is the ideal place to come home too! The room was VERY comfortable. We even practised our Italian with dubbed MTV!!! Who would have thought Jersey Shore would be so interesting in Italian (I can now say things like 'why are you cheating on me?' and 'Stop disrespecting me!' in Italian! Although I haven\u2019t found the right circumstances to use these phrases yet!...phew). Now to the breakfast. This caused us daily difficulty. The food was so good and plentiful we had to really eat strategically. First we started with rich cheeses and cold meats, careful not to fill up. Then some kind of unbelievably bad for you but extremely good Italian bread. Then maybe a croissant to follow which had to have Nutella smothered all over it ofcourse. Now to your hot breakfast, washed down with an espresso. At this point the guilt sets in, big time! Before heading out to St Peter's begging forgiveness for your gluttony - we had some of the fruit and cereal available. We did this each of the three mornings we were in Rome and have the love handles to show! There are plenty of churches in Rome, but the chapel at Domus is still worth the visit. For Marist people there is a great connection to the Society of Mary heritage. Even if you are not religious I would recommend it. Would love to return one day in the future!

An easy fifteen minute walk brings you to the Villa Borghese. The central courtyard with cloistered walkways gives a sense of peace and space. The rooms were very comfortable, well appointed and finished to a surprisingly high standard. All floors can be reached by lift. Rare for Italy, the rooms have BIG showers and tea & coffee making equipment. The staff were a real stand-out; they were very attentive without being intrusive and were very helpful with our travel arrangements. The food in the restaurant was excellent; it was great value and very convenient after a day\u2019s sightseeing. Our experience was that the restaurant and the hotel foyer were also great places to chat to other travellers.

At the end of our three weeks we again spent one night before flying home. The breakfasts were substantial with good service. The Chapel is very beautiful with Mass said every day.

The facility is excellent when you consider the cost of motels in Rome and the size of the rooms in some of the 3 and 4 star hotels. The facility is all new with large rooms and bathrooms. Everything is of a high standard. The staff are very helpful and friendly. The location is near Termini Station but I would not walk with a suit case. I still think you would need to get a taxi. I have stayed in other religious facilities in rome which are closer to the historic sites where you can walk to almost all the historicand tourist attaractions but a taxi from Domus to the Vactican only cost about 20 euro. I would stay here again depending on my reasons for being in Rome and to simply to re-charge the batteries in a modern, clean and safe accommodation before flying home. The staff organised a car transfer to the airport for us which was reasonably priced for two people and saved the hassle with travelling by train to the airport.

Opened in July it has been completely refurbished, and is beautifully decorated and has some lovely art works. The chapel is really lovely. The bathroom was the most impressive thing as it was Australian sized - absolutely enormous. The staff were very polite and helpful, and booked a day trip to Assisi for us, and a taxi to the airport. It's just like a real hotel! The breakfast buffet was included and was delicious and plentiful. The wait staff have almost got it together, and they could do with some background music in the courtyard while you have dinner, so that you can't hear everyone else's conversations. Couldn't get the wifi to work, but they have 5 computers available off the large lounge room that no one ever seemed to use. Great location about 10 mins walk to Termini and hop on hop off bus. You pass a great supermarket on the way as well. Dinner was a little pricey, and we I'd find the more authentic Roman experience at a restaurant around the corner better value. We had an interconnecting room and didn't realise anyone was next door until early next morning when they were moving around bags, so I would prefer a room that didn't share a door.

The breakfast offerings are many and varied. Especially noteworthy is the staff - they were all friendly and helpful. In particular, Daniella at Reception was wonderful - genuine, very helpful, always offering useful suggestions and advice about the best way to accomplish what we wanted to do in Rome! We liked the location as it was a bit away from the crowds of the big tourist areas in Rome. It is about a 10 minute walk from Termini and Piazza Republica and there is easy access on foot or by Metro to all the must sees in Rome.
