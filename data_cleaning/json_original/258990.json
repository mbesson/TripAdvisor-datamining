They are clearly capable of dealing with large groups but thats about it I'm sorry to say. The hotel is located down a side road and a good 10-15 min cab ride from the center of Rome, the website is great and makes it look very welcoming however the decor is very stark-not in a stylish way more cold and lacking atmosphere. Check-in was easy and the front desk staff were extremely helpful during my stay, a real asset to the hotel, the bar staff on the other hand, surly and slightly rude. Now this could be due to the fact that given there were over 200 of us at this event there was never more than 3 working the bar-the maths just dont work! So to the room, sadly not up to standard. Bed was ok, cleanliness good but I looked out over a car park wall and delivery bay. Now it may be my bad luck but again the noise was just too much, delivery trucks and loud banging at 6am in the morning-not the most relaxing nights sleep. Overall the room felt very dated and small. I guess this place is set up for conferences and can handle large groups well, catering wasn't bad either. I would say though on that basis that if I was staying here for pleasure whilst a conference was on I'd be very dissappointed. It's not a very personal place and overall just doesn't tick the boxes for me.

This was clearly too much for the staff who were struggling to deliver. In retrospect, I am struggling to write a positive review. The strengths of the hotel are that it is fairly newly renovated, it has a nice futuristic lobby and it is equipped to host large events - to a limit. When I checked in, I was given the room of a guest who was already checked in. This was the first time ever that it happened to me. It took them hours to find me a room that was not already occupied. When checked in, I complained about the ventilation and that it was too cold. They then told us that we should have the window open when the sun was out - which is hard when you are attending a conference all day and it is raining out. They were also not supportive in helping us to find restaurant alternatives to those that were in the hotel - which was not very exciting after a couple of tries. They had a clear interest to keep us inside this fairly isolated establishment of a hotel. In addition, service was slow, non-chalant and poor in terms of English. In summary, if you are a tourist you should avoid this hotel.

My experience was better than many of the tripadvisor reviews suggest. Both the room and bed were relatively large, it was clean and potentially a very good room. The wireless internet worked in my room but I was the only person among around 20 others I asked that this was the case - for most wired access was needed. In the conference rooms and communal areas the WIFI works very well. Unfortunately my room was let down by some factors that can hopefully be rectified: a) The airconditioning did not work. Rather surprisingly for february the room was too hot and had to be cooled and the only way to do this was to keep the balcony door open. When I turned the air conditioning on to 5C it pumped out out hot air. b) The telephone was not working - A problem when the first time you realise is when you find out that your wake up call did not happen c) The safe was open but in the locked position so could not be used d) The minibar was poorly stocked e) During a shower the bathtub filled with water despite the exit flow being full open. It took 10min for the water to empty.

The foyer and multi-level bar/seating area are vast, clean and modern spaces - not unlike an airport terminal. Surely there is enough (wasted) space to accommodate a rec centre, and with the number of conferences going on (at least 3 while I was there), I think the hotel is missing an opportunity to cater to a captive audience. Captive in the sense that one must walk at least 15 minutes to the nearest Metro station to get to the centre of town, or cab it, for something to do. But then again, it is meant to be a functional, efficient conference centre - which it is. Staff is generally helpful and efficient; the meals and service are good; the rooms are spacious enough (though there is no doubt about what goes on in your neighbour's room...). Each room has its own balcony, overlooking - nothing in particular. Conference set up met the standard. The hosted dinner event was excellent, as was the dinner. Overall no real issues or complaints. And yet, this is not where I would want to spend my leisure time. There are some decent restaurants a short walk away, but nothing else in the area to draw one's interest. And one can only spend so much time examining so many leather handbags in the small hotel shop, and wonder how the clerk can smilingly spend 15 hours a day not going mad from nothing to do.

There is NOTHING good about this hotel. The staff are rude with a major attitude. They stuff you in smelly, dark, dirty, old rooms. If you have stayed in as many hotels as I have for business travel and otherwise, you would know this is absolutely unacceptable. They forget they are in the business of hospitality. Not cheap either, paid $200 CAD, aprx 130 Euros. The location is horrible, it's in a suburb type area far from anything, where the local businesses hate tourists. There are some restaurants underneath some apartment buildings, but the food is not fresh and is over-priced for tourists, as there are 3-4 hotels nearby. Night is seedy, don't walk around. I stayed there as a result of a Trafalgar Tour. I'm disgusted this tour company could choose such a seedy hotel. The lobby looks good but is misleading, they haven't spent a dollar since the '60s on any renovations in the rooms. Bathroooms a nightmare with tea towels for your bath. Air conditioning is routinely turned off. Too bad if your room faces some dump construction site. Out of a 1000 rooms, some look newer which may account for some kinder postings but is still unforgivable that they would give tour company tourists such sub-standard rooms. I had to stay 2 extra days and after freaking out at the smell and the toilet that didn't flush and the intervention of my tour guide, I got a more decent room. However, that should be the norm, one shouldn't have to freak out to get a decent room. Someone should find a way to shut this dump down. No one there cares about the lack of customer service. Stay away. Free breakfast is a joke - cold hard boiled eggs and melba toast in a package. You have to PAY to use the pool - unheard of considering this is not a cheap hotel. This hotel is so awful, I didn't sully my digital camera with pictures of it. Only way this dump stays in business is that tour companies routinely book 45-50 guests weekly there. Complain to your tour company and maybe one day they will lose the business. I won't say this hotel ruined my trip, by was not a great intro to Italy and started and ended it on a very depressing note. If you can - find any other place to stay.

The rooms are equally old and a bit dirty looking. The balcony was nice, but that wasn't enough to cover the old looking room with the old looking bed with the ancient TV. Bathrooms: Were functional, and had the necessities. The shower head gave us a great trickle of water, perfect if you like washing your hair 10 strands at a time. I believe the toilet flushed water stronger than the shower did. Otherwise the bathroom was alright. Breakfast: Was alright, with the bare essentials in a breakfast, if you need something to hold you over until lunch, this works. Hotel Desk Staff: Decent by Italian hotel standards = rude but not to the point where they make you cry.
