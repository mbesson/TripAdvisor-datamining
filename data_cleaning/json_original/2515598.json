The mini-bar is seriously a fun time--keep the kids away because there are so many goodies it could set you back quickly. Beds were comfy, loved two bathrooms and decor was tasteful.

I had asked for 2 queen beds and early check in and they easily accommodated and we arrived to our rooms within the first 30 minutes of stepping into the hotel. Rooms - Very spacious and Clean. Our room was 20508 and luckily we faced the strip and the Luxor hotel. My friends had the misfortune of facing the Airport and a parking lot. So if you want a good view just remember that this is the first hotel once you enter the strip itself. They hit you with a 25 dollar room fee each day you stay and that adds up after a few days. I had to pay for WIFI?? Really what year is this??? How do you charge something that is practically for free? The ice machine on the 20th floor was broken for 2 days but they finally got it fixed. Pool - Sadly this hotel does not have a pool and you share it with the Mandalay Bay. Which means on a busy Saturday - Good Luck trying to find a chair!! On top of that it was unseasonable hot during our trip. Im from NYC and we loved it! but regardless there is no shade whatsoever by the pool. If you want an umbrella it costs an additional 75 dollars. The cabanas are EXPENSIVE!! What I don't get is if I paid extra to stay in the luxurious section of your hotel then why do I have to pay for an umbrella?? Isn't the point of paying extra for the upgrade is to have these basic things for free? Also where are the free waters?? Do not buy water or beer from the bar. Go to the service store and its 3 dollars cheaper across from the pool restaurant. The ladies who serve you by the pool were extremely friendly as was the staff in general of the hotel. Restaurants - In the Shops section I do recommend Burger Barn. The burgers were phenomenal!! We decided on eating one night at Red White and Blue. I will say the service was nice but the food was TERRIBLE!!!! It was absolutely atrocious. My brother had a burger and it was like a tops frozen hockey puck. I had the Grilled Tuna Steak which looked like something you bought at the grocers freezer. It was covered with some glaze that looked like glue. STAY AWAY!!! Clubs - MIX was a roof top club/restaurant ( i didnt eat there) the club was alot of fun! The view was amazing and the atmosphere was great. It wasn't as douchey as the other clubs in Vegas which are originally from NYC (yes Im talking to you 1 Oak and Marquee) Casino - The casino was nice, never too crowded and the drinks came quickly when we played. I like the sports betting section out of all the hotels. It was very old but I liked it.. in a world where everything is touch screen and computerized the betting area here was huge and you sit down in a school desk chair and it just had that old Vegas feel to it. Hotel overall - The hotel was nice, the service was good but where is the entrance? You enter in through a parking garage. Other hotels had a far greater lobby that you just stare in awe. Here it was dark and the black marble does not help. I would come back if I got a great deal again but other then that this hotel is the farthest away from the rest. It truly depends on how you want your Vegas experience to be. If you like it quiet then this is the best one, if you want to be in the middle of it all then my guess is you would select others.", "Date": "April 28, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Perth", "Title": "\u201cFantastic Hotel!\u201d", "Author": "LucyOz", "ReviewID": "UR128948303", "Content": "Spacious suites, lovely hotel.

As we have little children we try to get a non gaming hotel or at least a hotel with attractions. We chose THEHOTEL because it was advertised as non gaming but still has access to the beach/pool area at the Mandalay. It was hard to find the entrance of the hotel at first, sort of a back entrance through the garage and the check in was really crowded and slow. We did not get the room we booked for for the first night, however the hotel was really apologetic and gave us complimentary upgrades for the second night and spa passes and free dinners, which was really nice. The suites are very spacious, well appointed and the bathrooms fantastic. Huge Tub with TV and everything. Sound proof as well The spa was heaven and I really enjoyed it. The ambiance is somewhat dark walls but still light and airy. The hotel itself is shiny, dark marble and I loved the cool ambiance. The only downside was, that you HAVE to cross through the gaming lounge in order to get to the pool?? Somwheat bizaar, as you can access the pool from the Mandalay hotel without stepping into the gaming lounge. However the mandalay is advertised as a gaming hotel and THEHOTEL as non gaming. IN my opinion should be vice versa or I just did not find the correct way to the pool. The pools are really nice but very, very, very crowded.. to ding an empty lounge chair is luck and you bascially have to defend ikt tooth and nails. Also the pools close very early, which is a shame.

Well that was a mistake. If you wanted a spot by the pool you had to wait in line at least 20 minutes before they opened the pool area and then the wait line wrapped around the complex. If you werent there at that time you could forget about getting any lounges the rest of the day. If you put some clothing articles on the lounges to save a spot and then went and had breakfast like we did, the staff took your articles and gave up your chairs if you werent back in an hour. Needless to say my shoes were there but not my shirts and shorts. They checked the lost & found, but no luck.UGH!! Everytime you stood up to go get something to eat or go to the restroom you had people asking if you were leaving so they could have your spot. Other complaints we had is we requested pillows and never received them. Also if you went out to eat and had left overs you didnt dare shift a drink around in the fridge or you were charged for that item being it was sensored. It would have been nice not to have the fridge completely packed with refreshments. Every where our family went at this hotel/casino/restaurant/shop the employees acted like they were doing a big favor to wait on you and we did hear alot of complaining from them. The only staff that was pleasant were the housekeepers. Our family usually takes 2 trips a year and this was by far the worst experience at a hotel we ever had in 35 years.

One FYI: be aware that there is a lot of smoke in the casino and common areas. And even though they have air filters running, you still end up taking in a lot of second-hand smoke. So if you have smoke sensitivities, bring sudafed or other pills to help you.

As my wife and I visit Vegas partly for a relaxing holiday rather than a gambling one, things such as the pool facilities are important to us. In hindsight now I wish I had researched the sharing with the Mandalay Bay pool a bit more. If you have no interest in using a pool while you are here then it is perfect, unfortunately we did and found the good 15min walk through the casino to get to the pool quite off putting. Then once there we were faced with having to wait for someone to leave before we could get a bed to lie on. One day we got there 15mins after the pool opened and still had to do without a bed and lie on the floor by the pool (I wasn't prepared to pay their inflated prices for a nice bed or cabana). Another day we got there 15 mins before it opened and started to join the queue - I say started as we gave up after walking what felt like an age to find the back of the queue (I am not exaggerating!).

This was my first time staying in Vegas and it really was surreal. We didn't know to begin with if we were staying at THEhotel or in the Mandalay Bay itself, I would definitely recommend staying it THEhotel instead of The Mandalay Bay (although I've never been in the rooms of the Mandalay) simply because you don't have to walk through the casino to get to it but still have the access to The Mandalay's restaurants and other features. Check-in was a pleasant experience, we were checked-in by Jesus who was very friendly and helpful and then went to our room. The suite we were issued in THEhotel is honestly the best hotel room I have ever stayed in. Luxurious is a complete understatement. The beds were so comfortable and the little seating area was a lovely extra, I don't understand how people have commented about worn-down and outdated rooms, we stayed in 17808 and it was clean and modern. What was a little disappointing was the fact you had to pay to make your own drinks... The restaurants available are great with such a range of cuisines you can't go wrong. We dined in Ruffles cafe for both dinner & breakfast and both times the food was excellent. Furthermore the pool area is wonderful, very clean however very busy. If you want a sunbed, you should be prepared to get up early to get one. The actual pools however weren't overcrowded and there was a range of different types of pool depending on what you wanted.

Be prepared to spend much of your vacation there dealing with fixing your room issues! With so many options in Vegas, there is absolutely no reason to put up with such awful disorganization and service. Copy of the letter sent to THEhotel Management Team: Management Team THEhotel, Mandalay Bay Resorts and Casino MGM Resorts International 3950 Las Vegas Blvd. South Las Vegas, Nevada 89119 Dear Management Team at THEhotel: Please remove my name from all your mailings of specials and promotional offers. There is no offer that would entice me enough to return to your hotel or to any of the properties owned by MGM Resorts International. Although I did not ever get the sense anyone cared, I will tell you why I will never return to your hotel after visiting several times between 2009 and 2011. The last time I was there, in July 2011, I made reservations for a room well in advance of my arrival and called TWICE the day of arrival to assure my room was being held, as my flight was arriving about 11pm. My room was held with a credit card and during both calls; I was assured my reservation was intact. Upon arrival, I was told that yes I had a reservation, but there was no room available for me. Never in all my travels have I ever had a reservation that was not actually a reservation, as it is usually assumed in your business that a reservation means the hotel is expecting my arrival. You can imagine my hesitation to reserve a room at a hotel and travel far from home, only to find I do not actually have a room. Since this so far has been a once in a lifetime experience, all other hotels appear to be safe from THEhotel\u2019s definition of \u201creservation\u201d and are better choices for my trips to Vegas. Amazingly, a room became available upon insistence that no, I did NOT want an available room at the main Mandalay Bay towers and it became obvious I was not leaving your front desk area. Unfortunately, the room I was given smelled of smoke (I had requested non-smoking) and was next to what must have been a machinery room, as it was incredibly loud. I was told we could change rooms the next morning and went down to the desk to start the process, and was told I\u2019d have a room by 5pm. 6pm came and no call, so I returned to the desk and was told my room was not available until the next day. Excuse me? Lots of standing around later, we were finally given a different room. We were only staying a few days but lost a night of sleep thanks to the loud machinery noise in the first room and I spent way more time at the front desk trying to get the room I reserved than I did enjoying myself. Not exactly the vacation experience I had been hoping for and certainly not worth the money. I expect my hassles to be free. I would appreciate no longer receiving emails from THEhotel and have tried to unsubscribe with no success, and in fact now receive M life emails, too, for reasons unknown. It\u2019s unfortunate that we no longer will stay there, as we loved when we rented a cabana and played in the wave pool and lazy river all day. The drinks and food delivered so we didn't have to leave was the best part about The Beach. Luckily, we have been able to find other places with similar offerings that understand my reservation means I expect my arrival is anticipated.

I could compare this hotel to other hotels, but I think the real question is whether there is good reason to stay at THEhotel instead the main hotel at Mandalay Bay. For me, the answer is no. If you prefer rooms that are a bit more upscale, and a location that is more separated from the action, then you may like THEhotel. It\u2019s definitely more quiet and low-keyed, and would be good for business travelers or people wanting less of a Vegas-style property. However, most areas of the hotel, including the rooms, are dimly lit and decorated in a dark color scheme, making the hotel feel too dark. There is a \u201cbasement\u201d feel to this hotel that I really didn\u2019t like, which starts with the valet area at the bottom of a parking garage. The whole place feels more like a boutique hotel near a busy airport rather than a Vegas-Strip hotel. This was also the first time in my many recent visits to Vegas that I had to wait for a room despite arriving at normal check-in time. In all fairness, this was also the first time that I was traveling with others and we wanted 3 rooms close together, but a 2 \u00bd hour wait for our rooms was way too long. The maid service just couldn\u2019t seem to keep up with the check-out\u2019s that day, which was evident by all the trash bags strewn along the halls outside the rooms. Although we had a reservation for a suite, we eventually opted to take a smaller deluxe room which was available and received a credit for the difference. The following day the maid realized our bed was actually missing the comforter. I thought the room itself was actually pretty nice and had some nice features, but the bathroom was a problem. Although a decent size, there were no towel bars and no real space for laying out or storing things. The tub-shower was also pretty cumbersome in that the edges were very high and you literally had to climb into the tub. I think that could be a real problem for some people. We probably would have been happier with a suite which has a considerably larger bathroom. Frankly, the best part of THEhotel is that it is connected to the Mandalay Bay resort, which is a great resort and the real reason to stay there in the first place. That said, I see no reason to stay at the pricier THEhotel over Mandalay Bay. Mandalay Bay has probably the largest and one of the nicest standard rooms of any 4 diamond property on the Strip. The rooms are bright, comfortable and nicely decorated, and provide more central access to the resort. Unlike THEhotel, it also feels like you are staying at a Vegas Strip hotel, which to me is the way it should be.

Perhaps I am not the \"young, chic, up-scale, sophisticated\" client towards which \"THe Hotel\" is marketed.

Also - the hike to the pool - one of the coolest things about Mandalay Bay - from \"The Hotel\" -requires a trail of breadcrumbs and it's a good idea to pack a lunch before you head out. The thing that I love most about the rooms at Mandalay Bay are the bathrooms. They are HUGE. WIth a double sink vanity, a separate shower and soaking tub and enough floor space to hold a square dance. By contrast, the bathroom in my suite at \"The Hotel\" is a small closet. Really small. TIny. And disappointing :-(. The furnishings in the \"living room\" are old and worn. The TV's in both the living room and bedroom are old school, out dated models.

I had been working hard and wanted some additional pampering I was hoping this would be the place. I can defiantly state the room was large and I loved the bathroom roomy enough for two people to use at the same time in the morning and the addition of a second bathroom was fantastic. OK that is the positive. I have never stayed in a hotel that actually charged you to make your own coffee in your room or to use the refrigerator that is already in the room. I felt this was a bit like penny pinching since you are already charged an additional resort fee and resort fee taxes above the rate of the room.

Nor to mention when you call the front desk with issues they treat you with a less then caring manner, as if you are brothering them un-necessarily with unimportant details? Room service was another disappointment and a unique lesson in patients, after 90 minutes I called down to room service to see what could possibly be the problem only to be told there was no record of my order ever being placed which was a surprise to me since I spoke with room service for 15 minutes when I placed the order, they asked me to hold on and then I was disconnected. Once more I made the mistake of calling the front desk to complain, and was treated rudely and told there was nothing they could do I would have to speak with the Food Service Manager, I guess I should have somehow know that and not bothered them. Now it is 11:00PM still no food I call and ask to speak with the room service manager and I am told she is in a meeting OK this tells me one of two things, room service has many problems occurring and resolution is constant, or no one wants to address my problem. I am told they will take my number and as soon as she is out of her meeting she will call me back. Guess who calls me back the person I spoke with the first time when I was disconnected, she states she\u2019ll send my order up ASAP which she did the Pizza was undercooked and instead of extra pepperoni as I had ordered I had 10 pieces ? NOT good at all, she did call back to say she would remove the charge for the pizza from my room bill as a courtesy (too little too late for me) Checking out, I wanted to print my boarding pass so I went to the FedEx office as I was directed to do sit in the chair to use the computer to print my boarding pass and guess what the arm of that chair was also broken when I went to get up I fell into the desk as the arm gave way, ok you are crazy if you think I am going to the front desk again, I go to my room pack my bags and go down to get my bill it is 4:00AM I have a 6:00AM flight I am told that my bill is not ready because the hotel\u2019s policy is to shut down the system and run the bills from 4:00AM \u2013 5:00AM, however if I feel out the quick checkout envelope and provide my email address they will email me my bill the next day. You guessed it I had to call the Accounts Receivable department and request a copy of my bill, I did wait 2 days.

We had gotten a really good deal on this place so I cant be that disappointed with our stay but I was expecting a bit more luxory. But let me just start from the start! Check in, this was actually really good. Very friendly front desk staff, smooth and easy check in, and when I had returned later to ask a question they were super helpful and friendly. And if they did not know the answer they asked someone else for help. Our room was nice, it was big and I didnt find it that worn down, though I do agree that it could use some updating. However that being said I saw that they are updating them in the coming year. Somethings I felt were an easier fix that could have been done, for example the light in the shower had some broken drywall around it, that could have probably been fixed before any big update they are planning. The room was clean when we arrived, the maid however did not come until much later the next day, we had to call at 3pm to ask for them to clean our room. When they did show up they did not restock the amenaties and they did not even clean out or replace the wine glasses we had use the night before. The next day (dont know when they showed up) they left a half full bottle of shampoo on the bathroom counter, I guess that was our restock? But no conditioner. The amenaties themselves werent as good as the website advertised either, the soap was regular bar soap and I didnt find anything special about the shampoo and conditioner. We didnt try any of the resturants so can't speak to those.

I will stick to the facts and let you make your own decisions. The Good: Rick Moonen's Seafood was outstanding! We ordered the \"Kitchen Sink\" seafood platter for two, and ate like kings on our first night in Vegas. Shrimp, lobster, clams, mussels, oysters, and ceviche; By the time we finished, we were completely satiated. The wait staff at RM was outstanding-keeping both our alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks filled without having to ask, and ensuring that any sides or sauces were needed were only a quick request away. The \"Bathhouse\" was also outstanding and on par with the Aria and MGM Grand. Staff members were very friendly, and the deep tissue I received was probably the best I have had in Las Vegas. My girlfriend had the aromatherapy massage, and said the everything was adjusted during her session to what she felt she needed. Add to that the fact that the spa was not overcrowded like some of the other hotels, and you have a winning combination for your \"pre-return home\" spa visit. The Bad: I forgot to give my player's club card to the waiter on Thursday, so we stopped back by RMs on Friday to ask if they would credit our account. Both managers on duty told me they couldn't help me because the books had already been closed out for the previous day. After a little more pressure and some requests from my girlfriend, I was finally told that I would have to call the bookkeeping office on Monday to see if they could help me. Really? What ever happened to management taking the lead? In this instance, the wait staff definitely out-performed the senior staff. Because of this experience with the folks in charge at Rick Moonen's, we spent most of our time gambling at other MGM properties for the remainder of our trip. We DID decide to give hotel dining a second chance during our trip and stopped by Mizuya for sushi. The sushi was ok, but the wait for our food was lengthy. We ordered two rolls and two pieces of nigiri, and ended up waiting 35 minutes. I can't blame the servers, as they were doing the best they could. I definitely would not recommend this restaurant if you are looking for quick service. The Ugly: Kids are EVERYWHERE at this hotel. Every morning during our entire stay, we were woken by the sounds of children screaming or yelling and parents yelling at them and slamming doors. Start at 6 am and move forward until 9 am. The sound proofing in this hotel is on par with a military barracks. Don't expect to get a single good night's sleep if you stay here. When I asked a co-worker of mine about his room (he was visiting at the same time), he told me that he and his wife were having the same problem. I was hoping that the Excalibur would be the only \"playground\" hotel in the MGM family, but unfortunately, this just doesn't seem to be the case. Saving grace: I went to the players club to just before our departure, and the young lady there was kind enough to offer to credit my account for our dinner at Rick Moonen's (How hard was it for her to offer to do that?) Just a little effort goes a long way with me. That is pretty much the only reason I gave THEhotel 2 starts instead of one.", "Date": "April 1, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rotterdam, Netherlands", "Title": "\u201cWhat a view!! :-)\u201d", "Author": "Matsounet", "ReviewID": "UR127037786", "Content": "Just stayed one night in March and took advantage of one of the most incredible deals for a midweek stay.

Lately we've been staying at Total Rewards properties (mostly Bally's) because we can get those rooms very cheap. This time, we decided to splurge because our anniversary was a couple of weeks ago. It was nice to stay somewhere higher end again, but it does cost a lot compared to other options. Our first suite smelled like pot smoke, so we were switched to a second suite with no hassle. We had a great view of the Strip from the 34th floor. The mattress was too soft for my taste, but otherwise the room was very good. I LOVED the giant bathtub. Charging $4 for a disposable coffee cup was beyond ridiculous though (fortunately I don't drink coffee, and my husband just did without for a couple of mornings). The pool at the Mandalay Bay is fantastic - probably the most fun in Vegas with the lazy river and wave pool. Since we were there in late March, it was a bit cool, but that meant it also wasn't crowded. (At the height of the summer, it's nearly impossible to get a chair at the pool.) We did experience one rude floor person in the Mandalay Bay casino. The dealers were making fun of my husband for counting his money before handing it in to color up, and the floor person said \"dude - trust me!\" and then proceeded to count the chips incorrectly, trying to short us at least $25. Then he refused to apologize. We ended up getting a buffet comped after complaining to his manager. It was a good thing it got comped, because it was a excellent reminder that the buffet is TERRIBLE and totally not worth it at normal prices. Overall a decent experience.

The trip was not cheap and I booked Thehotel because I'd heard it was a good hotel. My experience does not back that up. When we arrived at 4pm after travelling for 15 hours there was no room for us even though check in is 4pm. We were asked if we wanted double or twin rooms and both couples said double. We were told that the maid was currently in our room and they asked for our mobile phone number and promised to call when the room was ready. An hour later, we had no call so we went back to front desk. A different receptionist said that they wouldn't call our mobile so she didn't know why her colleage had taken it but that the rooms were ready ( and had been for some time). We went to our room. It was a twin, not a double. The carpets were stained, there was a fixture missing in the bathroom and the plug hole was full of hair. I rang reception but was told they couldn't change rooms until the next day and I had to ring then. The next day was my birthday so my husband went to front desk. They promised him that they would switch our room and deal with our luggage for us. They said they would call him when it was done. He had no call so we went to front desk later that afternoon. The room hadn't been switched. The receptionist knew nothing of the arrangements and said they would never offer to move bags for us! I asked to speak to a manager and she was both apologetic and pleasant and gave us $200 credit. Our room was moved - we moved our bags ourselves. When we checked out we had mini bar charges on the bill despite never having keys for the mini bar. We also had a total of over $375 of resort fees - even though our rate with our tour operator included these. I raised this at front desk but they were adamant that fees were not included. Eventually on return to the UK my tour operator contacted Thehotel and they have now refunded the fees. However, I've just checked my bank statement and Mandalay Bay have managed to rip us off again. We purchased tickets for three attractions on their 3 for $54 deal while we were there. I have been charged 3 x $36. Mandalay Bay do not provide an email address for customers - just a US phone number or address so I either need to call international or write.

We asked about the separate tub and shower, and were told that the suites did not have the deep soaking tubs. So we took the elevator up to our room, a little nervous since some of the very amenities we were looking forward to were not going to be there at all. But lo and behold, we entered our room and stared at the Keurig coffee machine, and deep soaking tub. Also, we had called to confirm out reservation through Mlife, and were told that we had a VIP reservation. When we checked in at the front desk, I mentioned \"Oh shoot we're supposed to check in VIP.\" The front desk agent again corrected me that we did not have VIP check in, we only had casino rates... We later spoke to a VIP agent who told us that yes, we did have check in in the VIP lounge. It was all pretty confusing, this desk agent did not seem to know which hotel she was working at.", "Date": "March 14, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Il", "Title": "\u201cFire everyone and Rehire from the Top Down.\u201d", "Author": "viator1", "ReviewID": "UR126089072", "Content": "After three days at THE Hotel (they should call it THE DISORGANIZATION) I could probably write a dissertation on how not to run a hotel. As anyone can tell by reading my profile or my reviews - I travel extensively and this hotel is probably the worst in customer service GLOBALLY. In terms of comfort the rooms are spacious and they have nice bedding. End table furniture is slightly worn - but forgivable. However - from the time my spouse tried to check in (she arrived 4 hours prior to my arrival) to the time we left - the concierge - the business center manager - the front desk manager failed at the simplest requests and everyone was just outright rude. All of the negative reviews here on TripAdvisor prior to my own should be taken seriously. 1) Apparently there is not one FAX machine in the entire hotel that is operable. I had changed my reservation (purchased through Orbitz) to include my spouse who was arriving 4 hours prior to my own arrival. I called Orbitz EARLY the same morning and they assured me that the reservation was changed and they would FAX THE hotel (since it was THE Hotel's policy to receive a fax to confirm the change) and my spouse would be included on the reservation. Upon my spouses arrival at THE Hotel - the fax wasn't received. I called Orbitz again - and THE Hotel's front desk manager wasn't in receipt of the change in reservation FAX and wouldn't let my spouse check in. The make a long story short - Orbitz insisted they sent the fax five times - THE Hotel was never in receipt and so I had the Front desk manager call Orbitz and three hours later they finally gave my wife a room. No apologies for holding her up - no acknowledgement that something was amiss - nada from THE Hotel's management. 2) Believe me when I say this - everyone was just unbelievably rude. Example - My wife asked the concierge if there was a shuttle to the Fashion Mall - while rolling his eyes - he said \"...no...but...you (she) could take a city bus down the strip.\" He didn't mention that there was a tram that would take her as far as Excalibur or offer and other alternative - not even a cab. Obviously her only option would be the city bus. Same attitude was demonstrated by the Front Desk staff, bell hops, and just about everyone you came in contact with at THE Hotel. 3) The business center. The Orbitz FAX was one incident. In separate instances I had two contracts that were also FAX'ed to THE Hotel which I HAD NEVER RECEIVED. One of the sending parties even confirmed the number twice with the business center and at one point the front desk gave them a second number - TO NO AVAIL !!! Needless to say I never received my contracts. I can only assume that even though THE Hotel requires FAX confirmations for reservation changes - there is not one FAX machine in the entire hotel that is operable - and when I complained - of course they blamed it on me -and I quote - \"...(sir) apparently you gave them the wrong FAX number.\" Really - multiple times ? The front desk manager actually inflected his voice implying I was an idiot. Simply put - this really was one of my worst experiences in 23 years of business travel. I could have given this a \"poor\" rating - but this was just downright \"terrible\". The management of this hotel should be fired and they should restaff from the top down. Avoid THE Hotel - you will be doing yourself a disservice if you stay here - the staff is awful - this is not a hotel for business travelers. If you are a tourist and want to be treated like crap - I insist you should stay here.", "Date": "March 14, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ottawa, Ontario, Canada", "Title": "\u201cFacilities getting tired, service worse every year\u201d", "Author": "77G0rd_T", "ReviewID": "UR126047697", "Content": "Have been going to theHotel for over 5 years, with a short break to other facilities because of the service deterioration.

Got a great promotion online paying only $84.00 a night plus daily resort fee and tax. With the plane arriving late at night and checking in at 1am I was kind of worried I would either get the worst room or whatever but I was totally wrong. At check in the wonderful front desk girl stated she ran out of rooms and was upgrading us to a penthouse suite for the same price. What a nice surprise!!!! The room was the hugest I have ever stayed in, in fact larger than my condo!!!! The room or I should say rooms were well appointed with a dining area, 1 and 1/2 bathrooms, a bar, 4 flat screen tvs, and a stereo system with speakers in the ceiling in every room. The full bathroom was enormous with a jacuzzi and a walk in shower. TheHotel is in its own quiet world with its own check in and valet but very close to all the casino excitement of Mandalay Bay. Although the daily resort fee includes the use of the gym, TheHotel guests have to use the Mandalay Bay gym which is a far walk through the casino. TheHotel does have a gym on the second floor but it is not covered under the resort fee, apparently it cost $15 a day if we want to use that one. The resort fee also included use of the Mandalay Beach area but unfortunately the main part of it was closed until later March. I must say everything about this hotel was top notch including the exceptional customer service from every employee I came in contact with. At checkout they even gave us free bottles of water. As many have said if you want the crowds and the noise stay mid strip but if you want a great, quiet all suite hotel close to an awesome casino this is the place for you. Dont let the south strip location of the hotel fool you, yes it is pretty far from the center strip area but there is a tram that runs from Mandalay Bay to Excalibur which runs to 1030pm on weeknights and later on Weekends.

I arrived early and they had a King Suite with a strip view available, so that was a nice plus. Front desk service was extremely friendly and personable. HOWEVER, they do have that annoying check in service where there are no designated lines, so if there are alot of people waiting it gets a little chaotic. There was an employee helping to direct traffic, but he seemed kind of useless. Besides the quiet comfort of staying here, I also appreciate that I never had to wait in lines for food or elevators etc, just what the doctor ordered. I did take an afternoon in the Bathouse for a workout and use the spa. It was nice, but not as opulent as I was expecting. Nothing wrong with this place at all, but just a little small for a major Las Vegas spa. This place hit all the right notes for me, but the only thing keeping this hotel from a full five star rating is the silly resort fee. It's really dishonest.

THEhotel is perfect for those who are looking for a getaway that allows them to relax in their hotel and enjoy a less dramatic gaming experience (at the Mandalay Bay versus other hotels).

At least room service hamburger was good but not much of a menu Casino smoky. Subpar mini-bar. No beer? No red wine? At least the staff from checking to servers were all friendly. That's a big plus.

I have also tried the high-end places, Wynn, Encore, Caesar's Palace, Bellagio etc. THEHotel at Mandalay Bay is my best hotel experience in 41 years of going to Las Vegas. THEHotel at Mandalay Bay is a separate tower. The casino, restaurants, pool etc are in the attached Mandalay Bay. So THEHotel at Mandalay Bay is very quiet and relaxing. My suite is a living room and a bedroom, over 700 square feet. I have three televisions, a DVD player, an iPod dock, two toilets, a shower and a deep bathtub. The resort fee included internet. When I complained the internet cable was half broken, a technician came within 10 minutes to fix it. The internet connection was fast and reliable. I really like the lighting here. I usually complain about the bad lighting in hotel rooms for reading. I paid $105 per day including taxes and the resort fee. For that I might not even get a hostel in Hong Kong.

If your looking to party or just hang in the hotel there are some great bars in the casino that are alot of fun. Negatives:The hotel is at the very end of the strip so if you want to get anywhere you have to take a taxi or expect a long walk. My feet and legs were tired from walking on most days. Our shower was horrible. The temperature would go from very cold to very hot. We could not get it to stay on one temp. during our entire visit.

I couldn't be more disappointed with the service by the front desk. We had a reservation for two suites that were booked months ahead. Checking in, they first tried to ship us to two non-suites at Mandalay Bay because they were \"overbooked.\" 2 hours after check in started. Despite the fact that half of us arrived at 9:30 am, checked in bags and were told they would make a note we had arrived and \"link\" the two rooms. Once they had sufficiently stressed out our bride, they came up with two suites for us to stay in. 15 floors apart. The \"non smoking\" suite they gave us smelled like three cartons of cigarettes. I'm asthmatic. So is my best friend. We called back down to the front desk to ask if there was anything they could do. They promised an air purifier, they sent a man with a gallon of aerosol air freshener. Pretty sure he emptied the whole can, even when we started pleading for him to cease and desist. This stuff was so potent you could taste it when you breathed in! We asked to move rooms and got the \"overbooked!\" line again. We asked them to bring the ion purifier contraption they originally promised up to the room while we were gone, and though we were assured they would, they never did. We gave up. So the whole weekend we had the luxurious smell of cigarettes and weird orange-y air permeating the room. Hooray for problem solving? Hands down the best decision of our stay was to book a cabana by the lazy river. It came out to about $60 a person for a group of 8, but it was worth it to have a spot reserved by the pool all day and not have to stress about it. Also the server who was in charge of food/drink orders for our cabana was delightful! She was far and away the friendliest and most efficient employee we interacted with all weekend. They should send her to teach the front desk a thing or two. Or five. We left her a very large tip. The other positive: We were given day passes to the spa when we asked how they were going to make amends to the ridiculous start to our weekend, and the spa there is amazing. We went there post lazy river, pre night out, and it was so relaxing. Plus they had everything we needed to shower and primp after, so it saved time from trying to have 4 people get ready back in our rooms with one shower.

Let me start off by saying that I am not a Vegas type guy. Slot machines? Naah. Gambling ? Don't care. Smoking? I hate it. This already tees me up as someone who is not going to have a lot of fun in \"Sin City\" so caveat emptor. I was actually looking forward to staying at THE Hotel because the web pictures show a sleek, modern, Asian type esthetic which I find appealing. I also thought that its South Strip location would be plus. I looked forward to the spa. What did I find? Well.. THE Hotel is well-designed. It does have a sleek, modern vibe which is refreshing compared to the Vegas Liberace extravaganza. Overall the look of the place was that of a lower end Asian 5 star hotel. My experience quickly went South the minute I checked in and the sullen guy at the counter told me that my room would be smoking (did I tell you I hate smoking !). He claimed that hotel was 100% chock full and I had to accept his offer of US $150 in hotel food and beverage credit (wait for what happened there when I checked out). I liked the size of the room I got (THE Suite) and the bed was OK. I did notice that the hotel is starting to slowly fray a bit (the sign in the lobby reads \"O B B Y\") and the furniture in the room is starting to show its age (dings, scrapes etc). The room amenities like toiletries etc, were standard, lower-end unbranded stuff & nothing to write home about. The minibar was stocked to the brim with liquor but surprisingly there was no chilled water or nice non-alcoholic choices (only Pepsi, Sierra Mist and a plastic bottle of Minute Maid OJ). I expected a little more choice. The room climate control was surprisingly weird and the room would never quite get cool enough even though it was probably in the 40 degree F range outside. The shower had a harsh flow-limiter installed and it dribbled out in a miserly, weak stream. The TV was a CRT in the bedroom and this is crazy for the kind of hotel that THE Hotel seems to position itself as. I did use the spa and if there is somewhere really cool at THE Hotel, the spa is it. The facilities were nice but very undermanned and low-service. The food in the hotel was terrible (it tasted like airport hotel food: greasy cold \"home fries\"...), sour coffee. I really disliked it. The service at the hotel was what took this review from 4 to 3 stars: it was just terrible. Mostly it seemed like THE hotel hired disaffected minimum wage types who are inured to the masses that flow through the hotel. Not once did I see the glimmer of graciousness or anything that would remotely be described as warmth in the service staff. They knew this is the one and only time they'd see you so who cares? Maybe that's just Vegas... When I checked out, I was surprised to find that the food and beverage credit they gave me for staying in a stinking smoking room did not apply to alcoholic beverages and if I had spent it on drinks for friends I would have been out of luck. Thanks THE Hotel for not telling me that ! Grrrrr. Overall this place is MEH. It is OK. It is like lukewarm oatmeal... It'll do. Whatever. I don't think I would ever voluntarily stay there and spend my own cash. It certainly is NOT anywhere special unless you like sullen staff, poor food, the smell of stale smoke covered with air freshener.

You can get rooms for as little as \u00a368 a night but ours was $240 (including tax) but it was well worth it - one of the best hotels we have ever stayed in.

THE hotel provided one of the absolute worst check in experiences - the woman at the front desk was abrupt and generally unhelpful. I was rudely notified that the room I had booked was not available and I had a choice of a smaller room or a smoking room (I'm allergic to smoke) and she refused to guarantee a room change for the following night. The room (though not the one we booked) was quite nice with the exception of uncomfortable beds and very thin walls. The following morning we were grudgingly moved to another room after pointing out we had to call the front desk the previous night about noisy neighbors. The new room was definitely nicer featuring a more comfortable bed and was overall less careworn. The bathroom was fantastic with a large soaking tub, a shower large enough for two, and plenty of vanity space. Unfortunately, the issues with the front desk didn't end. We called down to inquire why we were unable to access pay per view and express check out and were assured it would be fixed... three times (the problem was never resolved). Few notes about the property: Both rooms were incredibly clean and the bathrooms were fantastic. Skip room service, compared to other major resorts it is rather expensive and a poorer quality of food. If you want to enjoy alcohol in your room, stop at THE Store in the lobby - they feature more variety and lower prices than either room service or minibar. The casino drink service was quite slow both at the bars and while playing with the exception of the sports bar.

Check in was smooth - the check in desk is very nice and wide and the staff were friendly enough. I was placed on the 6th floor in a corner suite.

I did think 'great!' - this will be nosy in the mornings, because they not only had their conference rooms but the rooms for F&B preparations (like a small kitchen with dumb waiters etc). I forgot about it as soon as I entered my room. BLISS. VERY impressed and I haven't been as impressed seen I stayed at the Red Rock Resort (in Las Vegas also). It was like a mini apartment, you walk in and there is a single restroom area away from the main bathroom. You have a lounge with a desk and chair and sofa - but I didn't really use this area much, but it was great because it made the room so much more spacious and homely - a nice touch when you're away from home. The bedroom area was nice a spacious - not too big but not too small - it was just right. I was solo but there would have been plenty of room for two people. The bed was nice and comfy. The view was medicore - I was on the 6th floor so could see nothing but a bit of the Mandalay Bay and then if I looked down the a blanket of white buildings (perhaps the roof of the lower ground floor?? and fans). It was noisy I must say. Wifi is chargeable (in the resort fee) and the wifi was SUPER fast when I stayed on the 6th floor. But after a couple of nights I moved to another floor because the noise from below was getting too much. They moved me no problem. The rooms were similar, perhaps the bedroom was a bit smaller but only ever so slightly. The bathroom layout was a little different too. I was higher up this time. On the 27th floor and the wifi was just no existent. It just would not work. Apparently, the higher up you go the wifi knocks out. I might have stayed where I was if I was told this before packing all my stuff and moving. On check out they removed the charges so this was fine. The room was nice and clean (except for the first room, where I saw something that looked like popcorn on the sofa in the bedroom). Bathroom was clean. I didn't have much interaction with the staff here but they all seemed very nice and friendly - hence the average rating on service.

I had once stayed here five years ago and it was nice, but let me tell you ...PASS on Westin. Reviews were spot on about the smell in the lobby. **I didnt go in a hotel room, just meeting space**, also they have a tiny casino. Back to THE Hotel. I booked this suite a week ago and was very surprised on how NICE the suites are. I had a two room suite with two restrooms. Room was very clean, beautifully decorated and very confortable. I loved the fact that I can work easily and in comfort. My room was 36914 (strip and airport view). Yes, this was a little pricey, BUT Westin was 20.00 more a night! SO, this was a better choice by far. I also like the fact that THE Hotel is NOT a casino, short walk and you are in the casino for Mandalay Bay. Which is a plus. Nice quiet bar in THE Hotel in the lobby which was nice too. Free internet in rooms (covered by resort fee). New thing for MPlayers, all rooms fees and restaurants in Mandalay Bay count for your credits! VERY NICE! I would seriously recommend this hotel and I will be a frequent guest for now on. This is a great place to visit Vegas. Only down fall is the location to convention center was far, but a quick tram ride then walk to MGM you can catch the Montrail and ride for 12.00 for 24 hours.

Once we looked at the pictures on the website for THEhotel and Mandalay Bay, it seemed a no brainer, particularly when we looked at the pools. By staying here, it meant we not only had access to all of the amazing facilities at this hotel, but ALSO at Mandalay Bay. This all suite hotel was a perfect choice for us and with the large separate lounge room, it meant my wife and I could enjoy some TV at night whilst our boys slept (when we weren't out and about). It was very reasonable for what we got and we'd definitely stay again! Upon check in, we were a little disappointed to find out that our room did not have a view of the Vegas strip (as requested). However, after raising this point, the staff looked into it and made arrangements for us to be swapped over the following day. To help us out (with baby bottle steralization and baby food being heated up), they also brought a microwave up to our room for no additional charge. The room itself was fantastic. We had a spacious lounge room and a nice size bedroom. It had one very large bathroom (with the biggest bath I've seen in a hotel room) and an additional powder room. The kitchenette was small but manageable. All in all, a great room and we were really happy! I went to the gym a few times whist there and it was a decent one, although perhaps not quite what I was expecting. I think there is another larger, fancier and more exclusive one that you can pay money to access but I chose not to bother. This was attached to Mandalay Bay and took a little while to go to (as you had to go down to the lobby, cross the casino floor which was not a short journey and then find it from the Mandalay Bay lobby area). Still, this became easier once you found your way the first time. This was also the case for when you wanted to go to the breakfast buffet and the pools. On that note, the breakfast buffet was certainly worth it and there is the typical overload of choice, so much so that we could not possibly hope to try everything in the 4 days we were there. The pools were indeed fantastic. There were several to choose from although the wave pool was not able to be used by our kids due to the age restrictions. Our boys did not seem to mind as the lazy river, the other pools and the sandy beach all seemed to keep them very entertained. The only hassle with the pool area is that there is not too much shade around so you either need to get there early to secure a shady spot under a tree or pay the money for a cabana (typical in Vegas - and expensive). The pool area was one of the main reasons we chose THEhotel and it did not disappoint. The pools alone make THEhotel (or Mandalay Bay I imagine) a perfect choice and totally worth it. It is at the far end of the strip so it depends how much you like walking to and from as getting up the other end takes a LONG time, although the monorail helps somewhat with that. Nice and close to both Excalibur and The Luxor and not so far from New York New York and the MGM. A great choice for families with kids of all ages, couples or singles!

I refuse to stay somewhere if I don't find it visually and physically pleasing.

I usually opt to stay at The Palazzo, but I needed something that would agree with my wallet for the weekend and this suite was an absolute STEAL! What I appreciated the most was that the casino and lobby at Mandalay Bay gets quite noisy and rambunctious which isn't a HUGE deal for someone who just entered their 30's. But, after a long day on your feet (no car rental!) sometimes all you want is a nice drink and some quiet surroundings. Every time we entered the transition walk way from Mandalay Bay into THEhotel, it went from noise all around you to pure silence with some enjoyable jazz in the background. The staff were extremely busy with such a heavy weekend ahead of them and yet we never ever ran across someone who made us feel we were an imposition. The only thing I could find to complain about was the lighting in the rooms, because of the tinting on the windows which I'm guessing is due to the gold paneling on the windows makes the room terribly dark.

Places to visit: Bodies exhibit, Blue Man Group show, fountains at the Bellagio at night (free), Eiffel Tower, Burger Bar, Tacos N Tequila, and don't forget all the people watching to do! One note- I'm not planning on ever bringing my kids to Vegas. Leave this for a couples only trip.

The hotel was clean, the staff was professional and polite. There were 2 of us and we stayed in THESuite and it was the perfect size for us. There was a very nice living room with flat screen TV and a very 'executive' looking desk and chair, half bath, a large bed room (king bed) with another TV and plenty of closet space. The full bath had double sinks, an very cool deep tub and separate glass shower. The decor in the room and the hotel overall was very chic and modern. Great color palates and the room looked and felt very upscale even though we were paying a very reasonable price. We were pleasantly surprised to find 2 robes in the room along with 'his and hers' slippers individually wrapped in plastic and a THEhotel bag. The room was very quiet and we got a good night's sleep. A big reason we wanted to stay here was because of the 'beach' at the hotel and the wave pool. The beach was definitely a very unique feature. It was an EXTREMELY long walk to get there from our room. We walked through the casino in our bathing suits and cover ups with our beach gear which felt very strange every time we walked through. If you have kids be sure to bring a stroller if you want to spend time at the pool and you're staying in the 'THEhotel' side. It's definitely a very far walk. oh - and there are snack bars at the beach/wave pool. We went to that beach several different times during the day and never saw those snack bars open. Get food before you go to the beach or bring food with you! The staff was extremely pleasant and helpful throughout our stay. The 'doorbell/do not disturb/room service' button stopped working on our door part way through the trip and someone was upstairs to fix it within 30 minutes of me calling downstairs. We ordered room service (late night snack) one night and we were very surprised by the presentation and how upscale the service was. The food arrived on it's own table with a fancy table cloth and the food was heated/chilled in compartments below the table. This hotel is at the very end of the strip and we found it was not quick to get from one place to another. Buy a bus pass and take the bus. They come often enough and they are very good about saying the stop coming up next and there's an electronic board so you can see the next hotel stop too. Check out the lion feeding at MGM Grand while you're there (around 5PM daily), the fountain show at the Bellagio (best at night), the view from the Stratosphere and the gondolas at the Vinetian. Oh and bring your walking shoes. This definitely is not the place for your 4 inch heels! If you take a right out of the Mandalay Bay entrance and walk for about 1 mile you can see the famous 'Welcome to Las Vegas' sign. Also there's a small store across the street from the Mandalay Bay entrance and to the right a little. If you're going to buy alcohol by the bottle get it there - it's cheap and the same stuff the hotel is selling at a much higher price. Also The Lion King the play is in Mandalay Bay - it was awesome, check it out if you can. Go down the street during the day and there's a booth that sells half price tickets to shows. We got a great deal on tickets to a couple of shows.

This was a good one.....so lets go thru the pros and cons Pro AND Con: Room size: The rooms are very large for the price (paid 105 per night on the weekend - it was a slow weekend) but it is really more room than needed. If you are staying with another couple (in another room) or with children - it would be nice to have that extra room and space - otherwise a standard hotel room is fine. For the price and time (weekend) it was more than reasonable for the price - rating excellent. Pro AND Con: Room selection: Even though we asked for a King they gave us 2 queens - no big deal - but not what we had asked for plus they stuck us on floor 3 - no view or anything - - just a view of the A/C machines........bigger deal.........Request a better floor room and they will seem to be willing to move you......but at 105 a night it was just as nice and the same price as any Marriott . Was it 5 stars.....no but it was fine. Rating Fair Casino: A Casino is a casino is a Casino........but they did have friendly and attentive staff serving drinks.....so I'll give them a very good Main Lobby - Very nice.......for those that are particular (like some of these reviews) it does have its entrance from a parking garage..... Very Good Fees: Poor.....but this is true of ALL of the upscale hotels in Vegas. The useless \"resort fee\" of 20 a day (plus tax)should be done away with or just add it to the price of the room rather than gouging you for an extra 22 a day for nothing (yes you get the internet - which was fine in terms of speed.....no newspaper, which supposedly was included - it might have been at the front desk for free - I don't know). Be smart and DO NOT use the mini bar.....really pricey Gift shop........try to avoid......pricey but the staff was very friendly Check - in/out very fast and efficient and staff seemed nice. We checked in late Friday night and out on Monday morning - so we were not checking in or out during peak times - but I would rate this very good - except that they gave us a lousy view. Dining - Went to the buffet - standard mediocre buffet......20 a head.....I have been to other \"superior\" buffets like the Wynn and the Bellagio - they are better but I don't think you ever get what you pay for at any buffet. Fair Safety - no issues Cleaning staff - no issues - they seem to keep the hotel in good condition Nice bedding, room condition was good........maybe not perfect as some complaints suggest - but the room we were in was in good condition. TV's were large tube tv and a large flat screen. Bathroom was nice with a large tub and shower and nice toiletries......ok robes to use....little worn but fine. Service.......I found everyone to be helpful and attentive as needed. I am a pretty self sufficient traveler....so these reviews where people felt slighted or felt that they had bad service are people that are probably more \"particular\" (aka whiners or typical complainers) than normal. Everyone responded to my requests as quickly as possible and did so in a friendly fashion........ Overall.....if you are looking to stay in a 5 star joint this is probably not the place but the simple reality is that all of these people that are complaining about the hotel have unrealistically high expectations........5 star hotels charge 5 star prices (400-500 a night - even during non peak times) this place charges 120-190 a night (except for big conventions - then expect to pay more).

This time I was offered an excellent casino rate at THEhotel and decided to try it out. Both hotels are part of the Mandalay Bay resort. Overall, THEhotel is a very nice four star property. I think I am unfairly comparing it to the Four Seasons (a solid five star hotel); really they're two very different properties at different price points. Still, given that they're both located within the same resort, I'm sure many people will at some point be looking to decide between one of the two. I did enjoy the very large size of the rooms at THEhotel. Even the standard rooms are large one bedroom suites. The bathrooms are enormous. The decor was a bit dated, but not terribly so. One thing I found odd was that the rooms do not have flat screen televisions in the bedrooms. There was a large flat screen TV in the living room and a very small one in the bathroom (a nice touch), but the TV in the bedroom was an old CRT model from several years ago. It didn't fit in with the rest of the room. Perhaps the biggest different that I noticed between the two hotels is the service. The service at the Four Seasons is spectacular. It truly is a five star hotel. All guests are made to feel special and welcome. No one was ever rude or unhelpful at THEhotel, but they didn't really go out of their way to try to help us with anything, either. I wouldn't complain about the service there at all, but it just doesn't compare to the Four Seasons. Again, I'm probably being unfair by comparing a four star hotel with a five star hotel. You are going to pay for the superior service at the Four Seasons. One negative issue was the noise level coming from the Mix nightclub located up on the top floor of THEhotel. I was really bothered by the music and noise emanating from the club even though we were located many floors below it. The noise came through our windows. The front desk admitted this can occasionally be a problem. It self-resolved at 2 AM when they close, but it was difficult to sleep until then. Still, this only occurred on one out of four nights. My bottom line suggestion: If you want a large one bedroom suite, or if price is the deciding factor, go with THEhotel.

Let me count some of the ways. You close The Caf\u00e9 in The Hotel cavalierly making Raffles a place to avoid because of the crowds. The reception at Raffles, one Blanca, who for me, represents your uncaring hotel, is as unwelcoming and unprofessional as possible. You have too many people looking to say no to guests. Your valet service is obnoxious. Do they really work on tips? Some of your phone people are intimidating and silly. When I asked for a newspaper delivery one asked if I had a butler. I told her I left him home because I was going to a luxury hotel. Your \u201cresort fee\u201d says it includes a newspaper; it does nor say it is the free USA Today and one has to pick it up. PETTY. Getting amenities and things done by your housekeepers is a challenge. Too much of The Hotel\u2019s service is handled by Mandalay Bay. Not a good thing. I save the best for last. I told the front desk on Monday the 19th to check me out Tuesday morning. I got my bill, which was wrong on Tuesday at 2 PM and requested a bill be e-mailed. Being forewarned on just how terribly inefficient, untrained and cavalier your people are I checked my bill today. Of course, you charged for Tuesday night and made some other overcharges. Your Margaret in unaccounts immediately informed me to prove I checked out Monday. After a long harangue by me she was willing to credit Tuesday. She still could not or would not tell me what the final total was . After spending about 30 minutes with Margaret teaching her arithmetic 101 she digfned to transfer me to her SUPERVISOR,after another 5 minutes I was transferred to Christina who was going to transfer me to the front desk. Remember them ? The people who messed up my incredibly complex checkout. I was not about to spend any more time with the inmates of your asylum.

First off, the check in line at TheHotel seemed perpetually long, so I walked over to the check in at Mandalay Bay, which was a ghost town, and checked in there for TheHotel without any issues, was given my keys, and beat the long line at TheHotel (travel tip: Do that). The room itself was not ready because I arrived before check in, so I killed some time in the Mandalay Bay (Ri Ra Irish pub is a great place to relax and grab food/beer. Relaxed atmosphere, and an amazing staff, especially at the bar). I am growing more fond of Mandalay Bay, primarily due to its seemingly inconvenient location. It is on the farthest end of the strip, and therefore, seems to be out of walking distance for the drunken mid western tourists (the tucked in Hanes white T-Shirt accompanied by the Camouflage hunting cap crowd. Stylish, I know) who stumble down from Circus Circus with their plastic yard long mixed drinks screaming \"Woo\" every eleven steps. The hotel eventually contacted me on my cell phone to inform me that my room was ready. Upon first entering the room I noticed, as many have pointed out, that it is fairly dark inside. However, it was very clean, the furniture was in good shape, absent of the typical battle scarring most Vegas hotel furniture has, and had a guest bathroom and separate living area. Definitely not bad for $47 per night through the Mlife. Our stay was quiet, there was what appeared to be a party going on next door to us, but we never noticed in our room. Only real negative was the remote control for the bathroom TV was MIA and the king size bed only had two pillows. Minor gripes, as both could have been resolved by a quick call to the front desk, I however, was too lazy to bother.

The person at the check in was very helpful despite some mess up with our reservation which showed us arriving a year from the date we actually showed up. The hotel was very full but he did manage to find us a suite with a promise of being moved the next day to a higher floor. He also gave us some credit to use toward the room. The next day was a bit of a joke. We had to cart our luggage around and store it as the room wasn't ready. We went out and came back at 3:30pm to find they still hadn't assigned a room. When they finally did assign a room they gave us back the original one - we pointed this out and after some wait they did give us a room on the 32nd floor. We went up to the room to find that it was occupied - then back down again to find another one. Once again they gave us one on a lower floor. We asked again for one on a higher floor and did get a room on the 34th floor - \"the last one we were told\". At the same time another couple came back down quite furious that they had been given a room that was in a disastrous state and hadn't been cleaned. I understand there was a bit of a problem with the computer system that day (perhaps a user related problem I suspect). For our troubles they did provide us with some credit to pay for a meal. We also had to make phone calls to the booking agent as they were unwilling to provide us with the buffet vouchers that were part of our booking - this was likely due to the fact that the hotel put us in for a year different than our actual visit. Now all of that run around was a bit of a pain but really not such a big deal. The room was lovely and gave plenty of space for our family of 4.

When I meet my family in Vegas we all stay at THEhotel. I think I will be looking for a new base camp for when I am in Vegas. A few issues are: Sunday night of the ROCKNROLL marathon they jammed part of the 44,000 runners with the outlet of the COwboy Christmas convention until everyone was jammed in the hallway to the convention center. You could not move, you were trapped shoulder to shoulder, anxiety started to set in. As if the above wasn't bad enought they did it again later that night with the poor tired thirsty runners returning and the Mandalay Bay grand opening of the Michael Jackson Immortal tour. Once again it was wall to wall people, you could not move for 20 minutes, wall to wall people, jammed in the walkway trying to go opposite directions. In both of the above instances there was no crowd control. I was shocked Manalay Bay put so high a regard for multiple events over people's safety. As far as THEhotel, I called three nights in a row for a wake up call, no answer. I waited Sunday morning two hours for room service. I waited Saturday night two hours for room service. My message light went on three different times alerting me to a fax. Three times I go downstairs and they could not find it. I lose 700.00 in a slot machine, took me about 40 minutes, not once did someone come by and offer me a drink. I called the concierge desk twice, no answer. I went down to find the concierge and was pretty much brushed off on finding about future events. I told the bellman when I arrived at THEhotel, that it was like \"coming home\" for me, because I stay there when I go to Vegas. It sure did not feel that way when I left.

Upon arrival, we were disappointed to see this bizarre entrance under ground - the only way to access the hotel directly other than walking through Mandalay Bay itself. The interior is very boutique-y, I liked it but it is a darker than some other hotels on the strip. Check-in was fine. We are travel agents so I thought we would have had more of a description of the property, but it was pretty quick. We checked in early and they had a room, but it was mountain view. The girl at the desk said 'she' likes it better than the strip view rooms since its more serene although I feel like she said that because she wanted to give us our room rather than waiting for a strip-view room. When we finally got up to our room on the 33rd floor, we saw a highway and small buildings and the mountains in the distance. Sound wasn't an issue. Helicopters and hot air balloons were visible which was nice. The view was still nice but not the strip. The room itself was just alright - same as the pictures you see online (we had a queen room = 2 queen bed), but the room was visibly worn as others have mentioned. Marks and scuffs, stains on the carpet and duvets, even large tears in the bedskirts - it was clearly not cleaned properly. There was broken glass in the corner in the bathroom and a whole bunch of smashed raisins and M&Ms on the carpet when we moved a chair over a slight bit. That was disappointing. The shower head was pretty gross too with all the calcium/lime scum built up on it. Just didn't feel as clean as I had hoped. There were two TVs in the room and one in the bathroom. The one in the bedroom was an old flat screen and it buzzed like mad when it was on. Super annoying. Beds were very soft, had to call for bed boards. They only brought one and said they had none left. Hmm. Suspicious. Either way, don't expect a Heavenly bed or anything too fancy. Sleep was just okay. The room was exceptionally dry (of course, its winter in the desert!), so we were super statically charged and it was COLD outside! Check your weather reports before you go - people were nearly half-naked, men included and I had a scarf and gloves on at night. The room next door was smoking up a storm despite it being a smoke-free floor and even smoke-free hotel, if I'm not mistaken. There was also a nasty smell coming from the drain, mildew or something so we just blocked the drains so we couldn't smell it anymore. We didn't complain about anything as we literally had no time, but it was definitely noted. Some of my higher-end clientele would NOT be pleased with the state of the room. Perhaps this would have been remedied by a room change or a good cleaning, but it just shows it is getting old in there. We didn't have time to deal with all of that as we were there for a conference not for pleasure. They really could do a few small things and spruce it up. We enjoyed Mandalay Bay and the amenities in general. Food was good and not too over priced although $4 for a Keurig coffee is insane. Perhaps bring your own and see if it will work in the room! You can get a full-day meal pass at Mandalay Bay Bayside Cafe I think it was called for $43 per person per day, might not be a bad option if you're in one spot all day. Variety was decent and dessert was great. To get to the strip, you have to take a monorail (free) to get to the Excalibur hotel, then walk. Its a LOT of walking. Bring blister strips from home to save you a trip to Walgreens like so many others were doing including me! After visiting some of the other properties on the strip, I would have to say location wise, THEhotel is not great unless you're okay with spending lots of money on cabs (if you're doing the strip shopping and dinners). Next year, our conference is at the Palazzo and we actually agreed before that was announced that the Palazzo or the Venetian hotel are perfectly situated and would be much better in terms of location. I can't speak for the rooms of any of the other hotels this visit, but location alone would make me move hotels for my next trip.

Mandalay Bay is not mid-Strip, and therefore you have to do a combination of walking and trams to get to City Center and mid-Strip destinations.

THEhotel at Mandalay Bay, an all-suite property at the main Mandalay Bay Resort, boasts the most well appointed rooms for the money you will find almost anywhere. Each room is a suite, and you get 1.5 bathrooms plus a 2Q room with a living room that has a pullout sofa. That's a pretty sweet deal, and there's plenty of privacy if you have 3 or even 4 guests sharing. Every suite is decorated in rich earth tone colors and there is plenty of closet and storage space. The master bath has twin sinks set in beautiful granite, a large walk-in shower, and a soaking tub. The beds are super comfortable. I sleep on a Select Comfort bed at home and I am a princess when it comes to hotel beds. This place knows good bedding. And now for my favorite feature of this hotel. The minute you leave the casino and walk into THEhotel, an incredible transformation takes place. The casino is huge and filled with people, but when you walk the 100 yards or so toward THEhotel, it's like you've gone into an oasis of calm. I love this... you can have your cake and eat it, too.

THEcafe at THEhotel is awesome. Unfortunately, it is only open for breakfast and lunch. Aaaaaaaahhhhhhh, but what an incredible menu they have both for breakfast and for lunch. I've been all over Europe and to some of the best restaurants on both the east and west coast of the US, and NOWHERE have I had a better omelet. The staff are friendly and exceptionally skilled, so you will never want for anything. Also they have the best Bloody Marys I've ever had. Check-in and checkout at THEhotel are a breeze. The on-site concierge service is outstanding. And I would be remiss if I didn't mention that the Mandalay Bay property has the best collection of restaurants in all of Las Vegas.

We found all areas, both in the room, and in the common areas to be spotlessly clean. On Friday night we ate at the Burger Bar in the mall adjacent to the hotel for great hamburgers. On Saturday night we ate the Mix Restaurant, where my meal was one of the best I can remember. I had the shrimp cocktail that was more like a shrimp salad that tasted amazing. For dinner I had the filet with bernaisse sauce and fork mashed potatos that was perfectly prepared. Service was excellent and our restaurant.com certificate was gladly accepted. The view of the strip from the elevator ride up, as well as from the restaurant and adjacent bar was great. We enjoyed using the Starbucks like coffee bar in the lobby (there is an actual Starbucks at the entrance to the casino if you prefer that) and The Store a convenience store in the lobby that was open 24 hours on the weekend and sold beer wine, snacks, and pharmacy type items at prices substantially less than the expensive minibar items. The casino is about one minute away from the hotel lobby and the atmosphere was friendly and fun. We saw Katy Parry in concert at the Mandalay Bay Events Cener and she put on a great show. We had no complaints and were treated well by all of the hotel personnel.

Let me start by saying that if you\u2019ve never stayed here you\u2019re in for a surprise. Unlike most other resorts, TheHotel has an ambiance of tranquility that I have yet to experience anywhere in Las Vegas. No loud music, drunks, slots, crowds, parents running around with kids, etc. From the valet - front entrance you are just steps to the main elevators, which was perfect because I was traveling with my parents who are seniors and have limited mobility. The morning coffee place is right next to the elevators and was never crowded when I went (major plus). There is a very nice small bar in the lobby, a small convenience store, and restaurant nearby. I saw very few people in the lobby and the valets were excellent. The way this place was designed is brilliant because it\u2019s a hotel connected to the Mandalay bay casino but away from the crowds. So, you have everything you need in a short walking distance from TheHotels\u2019s lobby. I think it took me about 5-6 minutes to walk from TheHotels elevators through the Mandalay bay casino, to the tram which takes you to Luxor and the Excalibur. Also, NO CIGARETTE SMELL ANYWHERE at TheHotel. Now to the rooms and what I liked. The suites are very well appointed with everything you could possibly need. There are several electrical outlets to charge your things, and I really liked the location of the safe. The bathrooms are huge and very convenient \u2013 just as big as the Venetian but much better space distribution. You have three TV\u2019s , a very comfortable couch, a wet bar, two bathrooms, two A/C controls, floor to ceiling windows, a big desk, high speed wireless internet, sufficient closet space, and very comfortable beds. I also want to add that all the staff I encountered were very attentive, polite, and professional. What I didn\u2019t like. The first room had a view of the airport so I requested a change to a strip view which they happily accepted. However, while looking at my first room, I noticed that the carpets were noticeably stained and housecleaning forgot to remove some taped on streamers on the walls that were left behind by the previous guests. My new room was cleaner. Yes, some of the furniture is starting to show light chips and scratches. In my room the shower head looked gross - full of calcium deposits, I had to request extra towels (only two were provided), the walls are thin so if you have noisy neighbors you will hear them, and I noticed that the outside windows were dirty. Also, I did not see any security at the elevators at night, however, on the positive side there are cameras everywhere, and I did see security roaming the halls at night. Overall, I wasn\u2019t expecting much but I was impressed by the tranquility and subtle elegance of the place. If you\u2019re looking for the 2 mile trek from the valet to the elevators (the Mirage-wink) or if you want casino chaos and loud music this may not be your place. This is a classy quiet hotel which is perfect for someone who wants to be really close to the casino but away from the pandemonium. I highly recommend this place to business travelers, seniors, couples, and those who want to leave the casino experience at the casino.

I will try my best to give an objective analysis of THEhotel: Firstly, the rooms were probably very nice when they first opened 10 years ago(?). The decor is somewhat modern but it has seen has since worn through; the carpet is stained and frayed, the mattresses wouldn't pass any Hampton Inn or Marriot level. Even pulled the sheets back and saw this cheapo, sagging, springy mattress. I was offered a 'plank' to put over the box spring which would not solve the problem and it is obvious it has been commented upon before by other guests. MGM are you listening? This is not acceptable in a hotel of this level, even several levels lower, the budget motels are stepping up their beds as that is one thing that is very important to a traveler. The overall dirtiness of the room was totally unacceptable. These rooms are cleaned poorly as there are crumbs and general filth on the desk, tables, and bathroom. The towels in the bathroom are thoroughly worn out and yellowed, and of very average quality to start with (are you serious MGM?) again, this is not acceptable. There is a tube TV in the bedroom which needs to be replaced with a flat screen. Don't get me wrong because there is nothing wrong with the TV - You just need to have a flat screen at this 'supposed' level of hotel. The entrance of THEhotel was even less impressive than I imagined from previous reviews. VERY UNIMPRESSIVE - basically just a loading zone with sliding entry doors - nothing else at all. If you were polite you might say it's discreet but this was very disappointing in my view. There are no signs for THEhotel once you get into the garage. Fine for everytime but the first trek but we walked all the way through the Mandalay Bay Casino (at least felt like it) before we found out it is 'that set of doors in the corner of the parking garage\" - No signage The Lobby was very unimpressive as well, showing its age and lack of quality as the rest of the hotel - the Mandalay Bay has a nicer lobby. Cracked, dull, black granite and white marble. Poor signage. The desk clerk was efficient but had a poor attitude and vibe. At first he said \u2018hold on I need to switch to another computer \u2013 this is fine but said it in a hasty, negative way while looking down. Great service indeed\u2026 Asked intrusive questions Not friendly at all - obviously an awful first experience of the hotel but I was willing to look past that as a isolated incident. Well unfortunately not, this set the tone for the whole hotel. The room itself smelled of stale smoke which we called any complained about and were given keys to see another room - same issue. Would have like at least an apology for this - somewhat rude and apathetic manager we spoke too. Outside the elevator there were dirty towels that had been laying there for about 36 hours and there were a pile of dirty towels outside of our room for a few days amongst other trash - I finally picked up the phone outside the elevator and complained to the operator. Next time I was there they were gone. Should guests have to do this MGM? The response from management confirmed our poor view of the hotel. After complaining about cigarette smoke, refuse in the hallways for days, springy and lumpy mattresses, very dirty rooms, etc. we didn't receive as much as an apology. These people don't care they just view their customers as cattle and no matter what new ones will keep coming. Well I'm helping to get the word out that people shouldn't stay here until these things are fixed. This hotels lobby, rooms, and staff all send off a negative, grungy vibe. As a friend of mine who was staying at a hotel of similar vintage but had actually been kept up said, it feels like a 'dive Hotel'. I couldn't agree more. Only one positive unfortunately, which was its proximity to the parking garage that came in handy as I do not enjoy strangers having access to my car and valuables that are kept in it. Also, all of the restaurants shut down very early and the only place open I could find was the gift shop for a $5.00 bag of Gardettos. This is a casino, people want to eat late, which you can for example on Fremont street but the only places open were bars with the typical corny, wannabe 20 something crowds \u2013 no thanks. Would not stay unless it was a very cheap rate - as they tack on a $22 resort fee which is too much. If this place had good customer service I might consider staying there again if the rate was dirt cheap but with the nasty, apathetic attitudes of the employees I see no reason ever to stay there or visit again You know where else to stay so just do it. This place needs some serious updating and emphasis on customer service to make up for it's numerous deficiencies. I know this review will probably never get read by anyone at MGM and I doubt they would even care. But I am among a large legion of travelers nowadays who are not impressed with these supersized hotels with bad attitudes, $20 drinks, and faux luxury that has been dated and worn without updating for 10-15 years. MGM feel free to contact me because you guys need help as you and all of your \u2018older\u2019 properties are becoming relics and CityCenter is on its way to becoming the same thing.", "Date": "November 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego California", "Title": "\u201cJust as nice as the first time we stayed.\u201d", "Author": "lesfonts", "ReviewID": "UR119994479", "Content": "The beds are very comfortable, my #1 priority.

We had booked a suite at THEhotel a couple months before our trip. I had gotten a email from Mandalay Bay with a great deal, so we decided to book a suite for the weekend. We paid our deposit and got a confirmation for our room. We were driving out on Friday after work, so our ETA was 11pm. I had called at 6 to let them know we'd be checking in later that night. I was told it'd be no problem. Once we arrived at around 10:30, we were told they ran out of rooms at THEhotel. They could offer us an upgrade to a penthouse suite at Mandalay Bay, and then they would move us to THEhotel the next night. Felt that was a great deal. While I was at the front desk, I could hear them offering this to other people as well. Sounds like they totally overbooked THEhotel. A few minutes later, the front desk lady comes back and tells me they are out of penthouse suites at Mandalay Bay too, so they only thing they can offer us is a regular room at Mandalay bay with 2 queen beds (we had requested King). And they can move us to THEhotel the next day. They also compensated for our inconvenience by giving us $150 credit for drinks and food at some select restaurants. It was late, and we had a long drive, so I didn't really want to fight it, so we took our room and went to bed. Wasn't our ideal room, but I didn't want to get into it at 11pm when there were a ton of people in line behind us. The next morning, I looked at the card they gave us telling us where we could spend our dining credit. I'm pregnant, so I can't drink, so I figured I can at least use it for food, but it turns out we could only use the credits at their cafes/casual dining places. I have no idea how we were going to spend $150 at these places if we weren't going to be drinking, plus we already had plans to meet up with friends at other restaurants. We went back to the front desk and tried to get our room at THEhotel. Of course they still didn't have any rooms available that early. We told them we don't want the $150 dining credit, we'd rather get a refund. The guy agreed to comp our first night, then proceeded to tell us there is no guarantee we'd be getting our suite at THEhotel for Saturday night. Irate, I told him we made reservations, and put a deposit down for a suite at THEhotel, that's where we want to stay, comping us one night and then keeping us at our regular room w/ 2 queen beds is not going to do, especially since there should be some sort of rate adjustment. The guy told us it's the best he can do, maybe he could adjust the Saturday night rate by $30, but that's it. I asked him if that's how much it'd cost to upgrade from a Mandalay bay room to a suite a THEhotel for that night, he said likely not, since it's sold out and the suites are going for $400 a night that night. So I told him $30 rate adjustment is not going to cut it. I asked to speak to his manager. The manager was nice enough to immediately guarantee us a room switch to THEhotel as long as we return to the front desk by 3, AND she will still comp us the first night, AND she will still adjust our rate for Saturday night by $30. I was satisfied with this, so we finally got the issue resolved. We returned to the front desk at 12:30 and got our suite at THEhotel. What a LOVELY room it is. Worth the hassle? Not really, Vdarra and Aria's suites are still nicer, newer and more high tech, but we were glad to be out of the old, slightly run down Mandalay Bay room we were given the first night. Being treated the way we were treated as a first time customer has turned me off to Mandalay Bay forever. Not honoring a reserved room with a DEPOSIT on it just so they can take advantage of the suckers who booked the room for double the price is just poor customer service. Don't let them take advantage of you. If they overbook and won't give you the room you RESERVED...fight for it.

Maybe its because we had just come from the Cosmopolitan Hotel in Vegas, where the regular rooms are absolutely amazing, but this was a major let down after that. The Hotel is dated, the furniture was scuffed and it just felt like it had seen better days. It wasn't horrible by any means (I did like their amenities) but it certainly was not spectacular, and I would have rather stayed in my \"Standard room\" at Cosmopolitan (there was nothing standard about it compared to The Hotel) then have moved over to The Hotel at Mandalay Bay. Also, Mandalay Bay's location on the strip is not so great, and their pool for hotel guests, despite being voted among the top in Vegas, was cheesy, the chairs were horrible and it felt like an amusement park, kids running around screaming, etc (I would not say the same for the Moorea beach club pool, which was actually really relaxing and nice, we were there on a Thursday so it was not very busy, I'm not sure what a Friday, Saturday or Sunday might be like). Overall, I would not stay at Mandalay Bay again, I was completely underwhelmed by The Hotel, the Pool, and the casino/public areas.

I completely agree with a previous reviewer that the lobby and public areas of the hotel are exceptionally dark, but our room was nice and bright and open, with floor to ceiling windows on two walls in the bedroom and one wall in the living room. Likes: Overall, the room was very spacious and comfortable and they did a great job cleaning it. I did notice that some of the furniture is getting dinged up -- I would imagine suites in Vegas live a hard life! The bathroom is huge and the double sinks came in handy, as did the additional half bath off the living room. Room service had great food and was very prompt, with the exception of our second morning when breakfast was 20 minutes late. Dislikes: After touring many of the other resorts on the strip, the lobby here doesn't really stack up at all with the grand lobbies of places like Bellagio -- honestly, the lobby wasn't even as nice as your standard Renaissance. Also, we didn't like how far we were from the pool -- close to a 10 minute walk, although all inside. The pools themselves were very disappointing. What they call a \"wave pool\" is really just one mild wave every 5-10 minutes or so. The wave pool I grew up with had about 5 minutes of pretty intense waves every 15 minutes and that is what I was expecting here. Also, the \"sand beach\" is really just a relatively small plot of sand that some of the lounge chairs sit in; it doesn't go up to the water. The lazy river was much shorter than expected, though it did move faster than the typical lazy river I've seen at numerous other hotels. A final disppointment is that they say you can rent umbrellas, but there is actually a separate section with lounge chairs that have umbrellas -- if you want to stay with your family, everyone has to pay to go into that section, even if some people don't want or need an umbrella. The room was wonderful and the service was very good -- everyone we talked to had a good attitude and were very helpful. However, the rest of the amenities do not warrant the price when there are so many options in Vegas so we will not be staying here again.", "Date": "October 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chester, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cFantastic!\u201d", "Author": "Flapjack_10", "ReviewID": "UR118991851", "Content": "I was a bit worried by the mixed reviews that I read on here after I booked THEhotel, but found there was no need to worry!

The suite was spacious, clean and stylishly decorated. Loads of room for clothes and the air con was a god send (and great we could adjust it). THEhotel is part of Mandalay Bay and a very short walk to the casino, restaurants and shops. Mandalay Bay is a great place too, although different decor to THEhotel - more old fashioned. The restaurants are fab - can recommend Shanghai Lily and Lupo. The service at THEhotel was excellent. On the morning of the wedding my husband had realized his suit was creased and needed pressing. He rang down to the desk at 7.30am, put an express order on for it to be returned by 1pm. The guy was at our door in a matter of minutes and back at 11.30am - all pressed and ready! We also had room service, which was very prompt and plentiful! Can't fault our stay at THEhotel and the wedding at The Valley of the Falls in Mandalay Bay was awesome - especially because Roland August officated the ceremony, highly recommend him!

I've stayed here many times and it used to be tops. Went for Labor Day weekend and took my entire staff, 8 rooms between Hotel & Mandalay Bay. I stayed in The Hotel. We arrived on 8/27. It took over an hour to check in. They had my reservation wrong even though it was handled by a Hotel employee at my last visit on Memorial Day (yes I stayed at this hotel a lot!). While my wife went to the check in line, I waited with the car for a bellman to get my bags. Because of my experience with this hotel, I knew there were problems in the garage area so I pulled my phone out and set up a stop watch. It took an attendant only about 30 seconds to come to me and give me a valet ticket. He then called for a bellman. 5 minutes later, another valet came over and asked me what I was waiting for. Told them a bellman. That valet walked over to the bell desk and went into the room and pulled someone out. At this point, I should have taken the hints and stayed elsewhere. Since this was both a business trip and pleasure, I asked to have flowers in the room and a cupcake. Getting that set up with concierge in and of itself was a hassle but I thought I had. I had a confirming email from concierge that it would be set up and waiting. It wasn't. To make matters worse, they charged me for it. I am disputing that charge. The rest of my 10 day stay was mixed with good and bad. The towels given by the maid serve had HOLES in them. I sent pictures to a manager but he didn't seem to care. Even with all that, the stay would have been okay had it not been for a break in that occurred Tuesday night, 8/31. While we were sleeping, someone broke into our room and stole my computer, my wife's phone and cash. When we woke up the following morning, we realized there had been a break in. Called down to security. Told someone would be up soon. After 10 minutes, called back. Told same thing. After another 10 minutes, my wife went downstairs to get someone from security. I called the Las Vegas police. Even though the officer went to the wrong hotel first, he arrived less than 5 minutes after hotel security. Making matters worse, hotel security sat at the desk where my computer was and contaminated the crime scene. It turns out our door was defective. The door did not latch when it closed. Of course, this was shown to hotel security. Did they get it fixed, of course not. When we returned that afternoon, it was still broken. Called down and finally got a repairman up there. Took all of 3 minutes to fix. Now, you would think a hotel of this level would have made arrangements for us and tried to do something for us. Instead, we were told that there was nothing they could do. It wasn't their fault. We received cold shoulders from all other desk staff and told they were not allowed to talk to us because Risk Management was investigating. The next night, I heard a noise outside our door. I go outside and a hotel employee is trying to get into my mother in law's room (we had connecting rooms). Luckily she had on the security latch that deactivated the cards so he could not get in. When I questioned him, he played dumb and said he was told to come to this room for a room check. He even showed me the text telling him this. After questioning him, he called back down to someone and they said he was at the wrong room. Was this another break in or an innocent mistake, I do not know but it certainly did not make us feel comfortable. Add to this mess ups at concierge. My wife got 4 tickets for a musical at Luxor. Luxor is another MGM/Mirage facility. We were told she could pick up the tickets at The Hotel concierge. When she went to pick them up, she was told by concierge that they could not get the tickets there, they had to get them at Luxor will call.

They were extremely friendly and always helpful. My only 2 interactions with front desk were check-in and checkout but they both went smoothly and I never had to wait. Housekeeping was always good as well. The suites were very nice and had everything you could need. I especially liked having a doorbell so people don't have to knock and also having a button inside the room to activate a do not disturb/housekeeping light outside the door, instead of the traditional doorknob hanger. The room decor is mostly dark browns and earth tones which isn't exactly my cup of tea but this is a matter of taste and I can't fault the hotel for that, especially a higher-end product such as this. It was very elegant, nonetheless. Room service took between 45 min. and an hour each time though they did warn me it would be that long and they were right. The food was good and priced at about the same as most hotels though they did have some less expensive items on the menu which was good. Some people fault them for their location at the south end of the strip but aren't you aware of this before you book?

Our friends were staying in Mandalay, so it was nice to compare the two rooms :) I actually liked the design of the Mandalay rooms better (brighter, funkier) and the standard rooms there are huge. It was nice for us to have the two-room suite, since there were three of us, but it was kinda cramped. We had a room right near the elevator, and the only noise we ever heard was the in-room air conditioning, which thumps on really loudly. Never heard another person on the floor though! I was expecting a long line to check-in when we arrived (as we've seen at other Vegas hotels) but when we got there, there was no line at all and we were checked in in minutes. Super fast elevators and never any lines (yes, there were lines to get onto the elevators at Mandalay!). The bathroom was HUGE and just SPECTACULAR. Loved the big huge bathtub!! Apparently early Sept is the perfect time to go to the Mandalay Pool, because we didn't have any trouble finding seats and there seemed to be plenty of empty chairs. Not a lot of kids or college kids. We tried to get a cabana on Sat and were told they were sold out, which is pretty impressive if compared to the lack of crowds every other day. Turns out the weather was crappy that day anyway, and they were going to charge us twice what we paid earlier in the week! We got cabanas on Thursday and Sunday - ours was in the West Lagoon pool - plenty of room for the 6-8 of us to relax, and cabana service was great. They could use some padded chairs with their cabanas - we went to the Mirage at the end of the week and their cabanas were SOOOO much nicer! But it was great to have a place to lock up our stuff, eat, and chill out in between pool runs. We brought our own tubes, which they blew up for us, but the cabana also came with tubes. Definitely worth the $300-400 that the six of us paid. My husband ate at the cafe downstairs and said it was really good - way better than the red white and blue restaurant in Mandalay that we went to earlier (just average and overpriced). Room service food was average - nothing to write home about. I usually stay more center strip, so the biggest difference with THEhotel is that you wind up taking cabs everywhere. We did take the tram to Excalibur a few times, but that only gets you so far. Not sure if I'd stay here again, just based on the location.

I'm going to shoot from the hip and be honest, Vegas has lost its magic. The straight up reason is while other places have improved, Vegas remains the same. It's kind of like the vivacious Venezualan bombshell that you oogled at in Statistics101 in colleage was simply magical ten years ago, but now with age and overweighted reliance on genetics, she's just kind of good to look at. While time took its toll, some forward thinking, yoga/pilates practicing, second tier lookers have now taken over as they had the vision to peak later in life. Anyhow, an aspect I can share is that I just feel that for the US to have practically invented 'customer service\", the dearth and death of customer service in Vegas anchors itself in irony. So, stayed in TheHotel for four nights. Great value on the suites and great view of the pool. Comfy bed with good sizeable bathrooms. The place is relatively new, so that's always a positive. Things to work on: CUSTOMER SERVICE ! - Check in was slow, not snail paced, but slow enough for you to finish a few rounds of angry birds. The front desk never really once smiled, in fact, they looked like they had some sort of perpetual \" I'm too cool for school\" face. Maybe its their game face? Room hygiene - The sheets had some stains holes in it, so they volunteered to change the sheets and have housekeeping double check everything. It's kind of like they expect this, so their somewhat robotic answer will be, \"oh, we're sorry, we can have housekeeping replace the (fill in your room hygiene or missing amneties issue) and for this, we will offer you $25 dollars of food & beverage credit to your final bill\". So whatever, let them be robots and take the 25 bucks. The pool - Man, it's a huge pool. Not the best in Vegas though. You'll feel like a sardine amidst the sea of sweating human beings trying to find an emtpy poolside / beachside chair. If you want quality adult pools with a party atmosphere, you will have the Encore, the Palms, and other notable hotels to choose from. Housekeeping - This is no 4/5 star Asian hotel group, so if you need slippers, toothbrush, extra towels, you will have to explicitly as ask and wait for 20 minutes+ so it's delivered to your room. The restuarants - you will likely venture over to the Mandalay Bay Property and you be lining up to get in. Almost feels like getting into the restuarant is akin to being part of a line for the Apple iPad2 launch. The thing is, there will undoubtedly be empty tables and seats. It's either that the Maitre D is chatting with his/her fellow colleauges on their nails/car payments/facebook updates and they can't cater to you OR guess what, \"they aren't enough servers in the restuarant to serve the tables, so please be patient\" .

Plenty of restaurants, a good casino and the children loved the aquarium, but of course their favourite was the pool and lazy river. A couple of pointers would be that the pool is very busy so get there early and the regular beds don't have shade (my only criticism and cost a star!), unless you find a tree. You can hire a cabana or upgraded red bed, but there is a charge of $500 for the cabanas depending on the day. The pool is also a 5-10min walk from your room, but that didn't bother us. We had a 5 min wait to check in and I have seen some comments on this, but due to the scale of the hotels I doubt this can be avoided, when we visited the Venetian the wait looked more like an hour!!

My husband and I were travelling with our 3 1/2 year old daughter. So, cleanliness, quiet and space were all very important. It was those qualities and the Lazy River that brought us to book at THEhotel at Mandalay Bay rather than the conference hotel where my work was. So, first to review the hotel itself: Overall, it was a good hotel. The lobby was attractive and relatively calm. Elevators were quick and efficient. Our suite was attractively decorated and had some very nice amenities including a second 1/2 bath, an enormous bath tub, and quality bath products. We were really impressed that the room was so quiet. We went to bed early and were never bothered by noise from the hallway or the adjacent rooms. It was impressive. The room was showing it's use and wear a bit. There were scratches, dents, etc... in another year this room will be looking pretty bad. We found housekeeping to be lackluster-- the bath wasn't wiped out each day, the floor in the living room wasn't vacuumed, etc... But, these were all minor. Our only real complaint is that the beds were cheap and not comfortable. Every time someone got in our out of bed, the whole bed moved, the mattress was unbearably soft and the bedding felt cheap and scratchy. More what I would expect from a 3 star chain that a higher end hotel. We did LOVE the Lazy River at Mandalay bay-- it was lots of fun playing there. Since we mostly went first thing in the morning or early evening it wasn't unbearably crowded. Thanks to previous reviewers for the tip on bringing our own tubes-- it was great advice. Saved us some money and also made sure we had a good size one for two people (parent and daughter). I read in some review that tubes were supposed to be the same size or smaller than what Mandalay sold, I didn't notice anyone supervising that aspect of things (or supervising anything but that's a different story...) the only rule I saw was not rafts.", "Date": "August 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vienna, WV", "Title": "\u201cSon just turned 21\u201d", "Author": "hinesda", "ReviewID": "UR117039271", "Content": "I was very pleased with \"The Hotel\".

Let me give this hotel one positive review by saying the rooms are spacious and are actually very nice including the bathroom but there is were it ends. This hotel is like a good looking person, beautiful on the outside hollow on the inside. To begin with upon entering the magnificent hotel lobby you wait 30 minutes to check in. A line of people standing there with all there luggage awaits. you. We booked to hotel rooms five months prior in which we requested ajoining rooms. They stated this wouldn't be a problem but we could not have those two rooms until the next day. So off we went on separate elevators they were on floors 2-16 I 17-34 I believe which meant to see each we had to to switch elevators. What I didn't know is that this is where the true nightmare would begin. To get on the elevator at any different time any different day was a 20 minute wait. Let me repeat 20 minutes. People were always in line for elevators some with there luggage. You would wait twenty minutes one would show up and be full. One day we waited so long my girlfriends and I walked the 20 flights of stairs. A trip to get a coffee in the lobby was a 45 minute affair. Lets move on to getting the front desk or room service on the phone another you guest it 20 minute wait. THIS HOTEL DOES NOT CARE ABOUT CUSTOMER SERVICE YOU ARE A DIME A DOZEN. How about the gorgeous pool area. Well lets begin with the fact that as a hotel guest your bag is checked like you are at an airport or amusement park upon entering. Better yet, did you think you be entitled to the use of a lounge chair at the pool. Well Im sure you did seeing as you pay a $20 resort fee each day let me tell yah it ain't happening unless you are there before 8 AM. In all actuality there are a few lounge chairs to sparebut only if you have rented a $500 pop up tent, oh excuse me Cabana that is, may you use one. The pools are overcrowded as are the lazy river which is packed full of kids yes you heard it right kids. We all have them, including I, we spend 364 days a year with them, as do is Vegas the place for them probably not. How about the Sp?. Which like all of them you are told to arrive a half hour early to use the amenities. Well we got there a half hour early and what did we do WAITED! Yes just like everywhere else in the hotel. We waited at front desk to be checked into until five minutes before the appointment. As you can see throughout this hotel the theme is WAIT and then be treated like [...] the rest of the time. Did I tell you all that it was my birthday while I was there and my husband had sent me flowers. Well he did and not only did they not call and inform me that they were there ,but when I very nicely asked if they could bring them up (of course I would have generously tipped whomever had) they informed me it we cost me $15. Honestly can you imagine?. By far the last day was the best. It was a Friday everyone had there luggage waiting for elevators then squeezing in on top of each other. People were exploding swearing there heads off making a scene. I felt the need to go up and speak to a supervisor. I was sweating, cranky and fed up. I told her they did not have the enough personal to accommodate as many guests as they had and that the gosh darn door to the stairwell on the 17th floor locked. I told her that if there were a fire there was no way they would be able to get everyone out of the hotel. She informed me that if I did not lower my voice she was calling security. I said not a problem Im leaving I will just call visa and put a stop payment on my credit card. I've never even not paid for a bad meal before thats how fed up I was though. Please please consider what I have told you before staying here. Its beautiful it has the potential ,but needs some work on its soul first.

We had an amazing time, loved our room (we were in the V Suite) and we will most certainly return. This was our first time staying in THE Hotel, we typically stay in Mandalay Bay. Unlike some other hotels, our hotel\u2019s separate tower was very accessible to Mandalay\u2019s casino, restaurants and other attractions. The only time we had a more considerable walk was when going to the beach. Otherwise, we felt just as connected as if we were staying in the main hotel, only with fewer crowds, hardly any elevator waiting and a much more relaxing atmosphere!! Check in was a breeze (however there were short lines depending on your arrival time) and the service we received from everyone we encountered was simply fantastic. To top things off, we received a very lovely \u201cHappy Anniversary\u201d gift our first night, which included a bottle of champagne, chocolate covered strawberries, cheese & crackers. We were totally surprised and flattered by the gesture. During our stay we enjoyed the pools and rented a cabana at the more upscale South-Beach styled Moorea, the adult only pool ($10 for women and $40 for men). We opted to go to Moorea both days and felt it was very worth the extra fee (you can sunbathe topless if you choose, there\u2019s always a great DJ creating an amazing vibe and there are no children. The main beach area can become very overrun with children carrying floating rafts for the lazy river\u2026 very cute but not our style). In general I would say Mandalay Bay and THE Hotel are excellent choices if you\u2019re going for highclass but still want a chic, relaxing vibe (The Bellagio was a little to stuffy for us and was SO highclass that it was hard to find truly casual things if you wanted them). Keep in mind that you can always walk from Mandalay Bay to the Luxor and Excalibur for food-court options and shopping. All three resorts are connected so you can easily walk from one to the other (or take the tram) if you find that Mandalay doesn\u2019t have what you\u2019re looking for. RESORT FEE: I heard a lot of people complaining about Mandalay\u2019s new resort fee. Personally, my husband and I loved the fact that we were no longer being charged ala cart for items we typically use (wireless internet in the room, gym etc.).

I asked for a roll away for my 27 yr. old son which was quickly provided. It was a clean and beautiful suite with 2 bathrooms. More towels could have been provided daily.

I brought my own tube to ride down the Lazy Man River since I had read they charged a $30 rental fee. The pool was terribly crowded with people pushing, bumping, and going beneath you. It was not relaxing- stressful. You don't need a tube to go in ,so many were in the river. The wave pool was ok, but not my thing. The small regular pool was the best, but it was very difficult to find a chair. The area is too small for 2 hotels. People line up before 8 so they can get a chair. There were many great restaurants.

First, upon check-in we were informed that the room type we had confirmed with twin beds was not available and that we would be downgraded to accommodate the need for two beds. \u00a0Although the room rate was appropriately reduced, this was our first (and negative) experience. \u00a0We selected the hotel partly based on room size, room amenities (I.e. Flat screen, upgraded, etc.), and if I had wanted less I would have booked less. Second, and most importantly, the hotel staff and mgr on duty did not satisfactorily handle loud voices and loud music coming from the room next to us at a very late hour. At about 12:30 am, I called to report the increasingly loud music and was transferred to security who said they would send somebody right up to address the situation. \u00a0I called back about 15 min later and was told that nobody had been immeadiately dispatched but that they had now. I called back about 10 minutes later, irritated that the loud music was still going on, only to be told (by a male staff member this time) that they were on the way. When I started to protest that I had already been told twice this had happened and was skeptical that somebody was on the way, he hung up on me. \u00a0I then called and asked to speak with the mod, who said that she would talk to security. \u00a0After no relief from the loud music, I called back and spoke to the mod (I was done with your security staff) who told me security had been preoccupied with a medical emergency and that was why they were late in responding, but nevertheless they should have shut the party down by now. I asked her to call the other room as an interim step and asked them to turn it down which she did. \u00a0However, 5minutes later music back on loud and so I had to call the mod a third time. I'm pretty sure they finally sent security because finally things got quite. The next morning, the front desk manager indicated that he had heard about an incident where security had been sent three times and the guests had been removed, but had not heard about any medical incident that would have pre-occupied security. \u00a0I don't think this was my situation as we never heard security knock on their door or have an interaction with them until the end when the music shut down. I realize this is Vegas and people are there to have a good time. My concern was how your hotel staff dealt with me and how long it took to resolve. \u00a0I'm most upset by the security personnel and being hung up on. \u00a0I realize they have a tough job dealing with all the crazy people, but really, they should not be interacting with behaving guests, should never treat someone like me as the problem when they've dropped the ball. \u00a0I assume you tape the calls and can listen to the audio. I got the feeling they are in their own vertical, not accountable to the hotel manager responsible for the guests' experience. \u00a0\u00a0Medical emergency or not, there should be enough of them to handle more than one situation, they should be geographically dispersed so that response times are not so long. All pools cloosing at 7pm and only allowing one pool towel per guest were additional minor annoyances that will most likely result in us staying elsewhere on future stays. I'm not looking for any future consideration; I think the front desk supervisor took something off the bill. \u00a0To calibrate, I've never had a situation like this, not really a complainer, but as you can see from this note the whole experience was upsetting, and if were the GM I would want to know this happened, and to know it from the guest's perspective. \u00a0 The Guest", "Date": "August 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Louisiana", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel, but housekeeping needs improvement.\u201d", "Author": "starbunker", "ReviewID": "UR116501825", "Content": "Nice hotel with great decor.

All was good with the hotel until I noticed the floors in my suite were not being cleaned (neither vacuumed nor swept) when house keeping came. Maids were only doing the obviuos (making beds, straightening pillows on sofa, cleaning toilet, etc).I stayed for 5 nights and the foors in the bathroom remained uncleaned the entire time. I finally wiped them with a damp towel and soap myself. For the price I paid for a suite, I expected it to be well-cleaned dailey. Also, one day the sheets on the bed smelled sour (from sitting wet in a washing machine too long) so I called and requested fresh sheets for the bed. Maids delivered them to us folded in a stack and we had to change the sheets on the bed ourselves....not cool due to the price per night I was paying.

This hotel is top notch in elaborate decor, unbelievable pools, the beautifully landscaped grounds outside, the well-appointed interior walkways, the wonderful rooms, the extremely attentive staff, the 5-star restaurants, flashy casino, and even the pleasant aroma when you walk inside this multi-billion dollar Vegas palace -- but be prepared to pay for all the extras if you're not careful. My wife, our two teen-agers and I stayed here for 6 nights in mid July and we loved our stay. Here is a complete review to help you have a more enjoyable -- and possibly less costly -- stay at THEHotel, especially when traveling with kids. Check-in: we arrived about midnight on a Friday and our check-in was flawless, quick and easy. Cab ride from the airport was $20, bellman quickly took our bags to the room and we had a rollaway bed delivered 5 minutes after we got in the room (charge was supposed to be $20 per day, but they didn't charge us for it in the end!!). Suites: At 750 square feet, this was large, comfortable and elegantly decorated. Two rooms with each having room-length, floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking the airport and Vegas strip from the 37th floor (other rooms overlook the strip and mountains or the mountains and pool). Room had 1 1/2 baths, main bath was extremely large with a deep bath tub and glass enclosed shower. A flat screen TV was in the bathroom, which had double sinks. The two queen beds were extremely comfortable and a large TV was in the room with plenty of drawers for our clothing. The living room had a large, comfortable sofa (NOT a foldout sofa), desk, and sleek entertainment center with a large flat screen TV and separate DVD player. The room had a sink and bar area complete with glasses, wine cork screw. The refrigerator cannot be used for personal storage as it only contains items for purchase. You cannot take out items from it or you will be charged for those items (even if you intend to replace them). Instead, you can rent a refrigerator for personal use at $20 per day, which we did not do. The coffee maker is a single cup, Keurig coffee maker that you have to pay $4.00 per cup if you want to use it. If you want any utensils, you have to pay for them; if you need a bottle opener, it is $1.50 from room service, plus tip. My suggestion is to bring your own utensils here if you plan on eating in the room and coffee singles packets, plus your cream and sugar. You also pay a resort fee of $20 extra per night, which includes use of the internet (which was very reliable for our laptop, but not our iTouches), plus the pools and large, modern exercise facilities. Ask housekeeping for extra towels, pillows or shampoo if you need these items (no extra charge). Housekeeping was very good. The elevators in the massive structure were fast and efficient. We had no issues and never had to wait long, no matter which time of day that we rode them. The pools: the pools are large, beautifully landscaped with shrubs, palm trees and other tropical plants and very refreshing. The lazy river was a good speed, a little crowded (but not excessively); the wave pool was large, but our kids complained that only one wave would come out at a time spaced about a minute apart, so they got bored of it quickly. A warm, shallow pool was next to the wave pool and a large, sandy beach faced the wave pool. Our challenge each morning was to find chairs that were in the shade, but they are limited. If you want a chair in the direct sun, you'll have your choice (but laying out in 105-110 degree temps for 3-4 hours was not our plan). So to get a chair in the shade, get to the pool when it opens at 8 a.m. and you'll have your pick. Reserve a chair by placing a towel and personal item like a book on it. For the lazy river, bring your own inflatable tubes or you will have to pay $25 per tube at the pool (we picked up 4 big tubes for $10 each at Walmart). Pool attendants will fill up the tubes for you for free. If you don't want a tube in the lazy river, the lifeguards allow you to float or walk in it without a tube. The lazy river is long and VERY nice. One towel per guest when you enter the pool area, however, just go back again to get additional towels. There is a large open aired bar where you can get drinks, although expensive at sporting event prices ($8 for a 16-ounce beer and $15 for a frozen daquiri). We had no issues with any ``drunk'' people at the pool area. Everyone was well-behaved. Having two teens with us, we kept an eye out for anyone out of control, but -- as expected -- did not encounter any problems. The trek to get to the pool is long. From our room it was a 10-15 minute walk. From THEHotel, you can go the long way through the casino and restaurants to the pool, or you can take a shortcut through the parking garage to the restaurants area then to the pool(this is definitely the shortest, fastest route). The restaurants in Mandalay Bay are top-notch and very expensive, whether you want breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks, ``just drinks,'' or appetizers. Expect breakfast for four, with tip, at $60 minimum; lunch $70-$80 minimum without alcohol, or $80-$140 for dinner without alcohol ($90 for 4 burgers and 4 soft drinks at the Burger Bar restaurant). Having been pre-warned about the expensive restaurants and eateries, we planned ahead......For our family of four, we took a cab ride on the first day, bought $100 of breakfast foods, fruit, coffee, snacks, soft drinks, beer and booze (for my wife and I) and probably saved $500-$600. Breakfast alone at a restaurant here would have been minimum $60 per day X 6 days. Sure the casinos give you ``free drinks'' when you are gambling, but my wife I were not in the casino much to really take advantage of that option. Even when we were, wait staff taking ``free'' drink orders seldom came around. When they do come around, order 2 drinks at a time. So we often just took drinks from our room when going around the resort or walking the strip (remember, this is Vegas so you can take your booze anywhere). The problem with the restaurants here -- in my opinion -- is that you are limited with ``expensive,'' ``more expensive'' and ``super expensive'' categories. Because of that, with Mandalay Bay being so far from the rest of the strip, getting to a less expensive restaurant (even Hard Rock Cafe, Rainforest Cafe, Cheesecake Factory, Margaritaville) becomes a monumental task and potentially even more expensive if you get a cab. That said, I would recommend Hussong's Mexican restaurant in the attached Mandalay Bay mall that connects to the Luxor. Very good food, excellent service and reasonable (we used a $25 gift certificate that we purchased on Restaurant.com). Many of the restaurants at Mandalay Bay have gift certificates on restaurant.com, but they are still very expensive. A drawback with Mandalay Bay is that because it is at the far end of the strip (next to Luxor), it is a long walk/tram ride/taxi ride anywhere on the strip. Getting to the free tram that runs from Mandalay to Excalibur and Luxor is a 10-15 minute walk from the room. The tram ride is quick. The good side, however, is that the hotel/casino doesn't get heavy foot traffic from people walking the strip (they usually stop at MGM Grand or New York New York). Mandalay Bay had noticeably much LESS foot traffic than the other hotels. If you don't have a car and you don't want to walk the strip or ride the tram, a cab ride is anywhere from $10-$20 one-way to a location on the strip (depending on the distance). Overall THEHotel at Mandalay Bay was excellent and we would definitely stay here again. The room was a great value -- with our air-hotel package it averaged to $120 per night for four. Really no complaints from my wife and I, except the expensive food and drink prices here. The room was excellent, staff was very helpful and great, the pool area was awesome, and the look and feel of the entire resort was 5 stars out of 5.", "Date": "July 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney, Australia", "Title": "\u201cNot Impressed\u201d", "Author": "Roomfreak", "ReviewID": "UR115700040", "Content": "Arrived at 7 pm and HAD TO WAIT for a room - 7 am maybe but not 7 pm.

Pros: The rooms are all suites and include a second bathroom and having the second bathroom (toilet and sink only) was an important benefit when having 3 in the room. The room was furnished beautifully with a 42\" tv in the living room as well as a wet bar in the living room. Access to the Mandalay Bay pool area which is the best pool in vegas hands down. Note water is heated to 80 degrees which makes the pool usable in the fall months like Sept, Oct. Cons: Walk to Mandalay Bay pool area is very long and requires you walk through the entire Mandalay Bay Casino. Also when busy they only give each person a single towel which is ridiculous for a 4 star resort. You end up going back and forth to get a resonable # of towels for the day which for me is 3. ( 2 to cover chair and one to dry with). Dinner buffet at $29 on a Saturday was not worth the money. Prime Rib was rubbery and other meats were subpar. Breakfast and lunch buffets at $20 are just OK. Tip: The Luxor next door has a dinner buffet that is only $20 and has much more variety and better quality of food.

Our first trip we asked if we could get an upgrade but it wasn't offered for free so we decided to skip it. We still had a nice room with a nice view. The rooms are BIG and decorated so nicely and very modern. Our room had a seperate powder room and living room space. This was nice! The tub is to die for. I used it a few time on both stays. We stayed away from the mini bar cause the price was ridiculous. We did order room service on both stays and the breakfast was AMAZING! Everything else was just so so. Our second trip they ended comping our room service because we gambled so much! The pools at Mandalay Bay are amazing. There is no other hotel that offers anything like it. They have a wave pool- lazy river and all set in a lush \"resort-like\" setting. There are chairs everywhere and we always found a seat. The drinks are, of course, crazy expensive, among everything else. The food at the grill is pretty good though- and you get A LOT of food! Speaking on food- the buffet at the hotel is ok. Really expensive and large but I wasn't overly impressed. I also was not happy with any of the meals we had at The House of Blues. It's such a cool looking place but each meal came out cool and blah. We didn't try any other resturants in the complex. I loved that it's hooked to the luxor! You can take a tram or just walk through their \"mall\" and get to the other hotel. They have Urban outfitters and all other kinds of stores in the mall. They also have a FAT TUESDAY's. There is one of them in Philadelphia and we LOVE their slushy drinks! Good buy- get one of their large cups and they refill them anywhere on the strip for a fraction of the cost!! And there is a lot of FAT TUESDAY's up and down the strip! Over all we were happy with our stay both times we were there. Yes, it's far from the strip but we didn't mind!

We got there about 11:30pm and when we checked in we were told that they were sold out and they could put us in the main Mandalay Bay hotel. Ummmm NO. Reservation was for THEhotel and that's why I CALLED earlier. That is exactly what I told the girl at the desk. Then I was offered a \"smoking/non-smoking room\" (doesn't that just make it a smoking room??) although I specifically requested non-smoking. At this point I just stared at her. She finally said in the morning they could switch rooms and offered to comp some room service and a small rate reduction of the first night. I was fairly peeved. The room did smell like smoke but at that point there wasn't much choice. Super loud thumping of some machinery every few minutes, too. We went out for a drink because at this point, we needed it. Awful sleep with that thumping noise and in the morning I went down to the front desk where I was assured that we would have a room on the 37th floor by the afternoon and they got my mobile number to call and let me know. We went out and about all day and by 5pm, still no phone call. We went back to the front desk where they had no record of a room change (??) and TWO people worked for about 15 min typing and looking at their computer. I got so annoyed I left to walk around and let my friend handle it. When I came back, they had given us a room on the 22nd floor--a corner unit, non-smoking. The room turned out fine and the rest of the nights were better, but what a freakin' hassle for what I should have had in the first place! I've always stayed at THEhotel for my Vegas trips, which I do a few times a year. I cannot say I will be back again, though. Other hotels are just as nice and similar pricing and I'd prefer to avoid the hassle on a VACATION. Note to management: I understand wanting max occupancy for revenue, but if a guest reserves a room and has paid a deposit, make sure you actually HAVE a room for them when they arrive.

Even thought the sq footage is similar to Encore, I prefer the layout at THEhotel where you get a true suite with a door between the LR and BR and the second half bath is a luxury not found elsewhere for a standard room category. We were 2 females sharing a double room and having that second bath was primo for getting ready. Room temperature was great and I like that each room of the suite has it's own thermostat. Plenty of space and 2 flat screen tvs (1 in each room) plus a baby LCD in the main bath. The tv is in the right spot in the bath so you can even watch tv from the shower or tub! Now the cons: while I appreciate the sexiness of the dark furniture and low lighting, the lighting should be on a proper dimmer switch so you have the option of actually seeing well. They have a dimmer but your choices are dark to dim! The very low lighting isn't great for getting ready but since they have a lighted makeup mirror on an arm in the bathroom, I'll forgive them. Second, the room was looking a little shabby: the bed skirt had a tear in it and the lampshade on the night stand had a big rip in it.

We requested that we have our rooms at least on the same floor and hopefully near one another. We had requested 2 beds in our room. At check in, the agent said that the hotel was completely sold out and that she couldn't grant us a room with 2 beds, nor on the same floor. We were on the 37th floor and our friend was on 28. The agent recommended that we call the front desk the next morning since many check out on Sundays. We knew it would be a hassle, but had no choice and would hope for the best in the morning. We got to our room and it immediately reeked of cigarettes even though we were in a NS room. We immediately turned around and went back downstairs to the front desk. I spotted our original agent, Gigi and explained. She apologized and said she would go in the back and see if she could work some 'magic'. I decided that if she came back with good news, I would tip her $20. Sure enough, not only did she now miraculously have a room with 2 beds, but also on the same floor as our friend! How so? We didn't care and all that mattered was that we got what we wanted! I gave her the $20 and thanked her for her efforts. When we go to the room, we were pleasantly surprised that it wasn't smokey. We visited the Spa at Mandalay and while they had all of the typical amenities, I prefer Bathhouse at THEhotel. The Spa at Mandalay was dated. We dined at Border Grill which was very good and saw The Lion King which was excellent. Gambling was so so at the casino. Resort fee now includes wifi.

You learn this early in life.

My wife does marketing and business development for a professional business and dumped a lot of money into this hotel for a four night stay.........thousands of dollars........and we hadn't even arrived yet. So knowing that THE Hotel is the luxury, upscale hotel at Mandalay Bay, I expected a bit more. Last year we stayed at Palazzo, the upscale, luxury hotel at Venetian, and it was very accommodating. This trip....not so much. The real problem began at the front desk when my wife asked for room with a view of the strip. Jimson, the clerk at the desk, told my wife that THE Hotel was sold out and other rooms were not available. Upon hearing this, after I was able to stuff my eyeballs back into their sockets, I leaned over and read his name tag and said, \"are you sure about that Jimson?\" Jimson replied that actually there might be a room available later, but because we were checking in at 1:00pm, mountain view was all that was available. My wife explained that we could wait for a strip view room if that was necessary. Jimson picked up the phone and talked to someone, and then told us there was a strip view room available. (Remember my wife had spent thousands of dollars already!) He gave us the key and when we got to the room, it was a view of the airport and if you leaned over really far and stood in the corner of the room, you could actually see Luxor Pyramid. (Remember my wife had already spent thousands of dollars for our four nigh stay!) Before we arrived, I pulled up THE Hotel's website to see what the room rate was and was surprised to see it was about $70 for Weds, $80 for Thrs., $120 for Fri, and $290 for Sat. We paid $200 a night, months in advance, because of the conference. My wife called the front desk from the room and asked to speak to Jimson's manager and explained that she had made a simple request, and was lied to by the desk clerk (hotel was sold out). The manager was Tess, and Tess assured us that THE Hotel was sold out for Thursday (even though the rate on THE Hotel's website offered rooms for Thrs. at a whopping $80). Tess said if we were willing to wait, she would get us a room with a strip view. We tried not to laugh too hard at this point and my wife pointed out that we already told the front desk we would wait. Tess told us she would call us back, but never did. At 3:00pm, we went back to the front desk. The front desk clerk had no idea what we were talking about, but was able to check us into a room with at strip view.

Luxurious and tranquil, we find the hotel both sleek, as well as rich and warm. Their lobby is smoke-free (a rarity in Vegas; in fact they even pump scented air *into* the lobby). The rooms are almost all suites and the bathrooms are to die for. And... Our first time there, after about 40 minutes in the room, we discovered a second bathroom and a third TV! Additionally, it has many fewer rooms than other hotels so it feels more intimate and is definitely quiet. Downstairs, you've got your own bar, lounge, restaurant, and coffee area to save you from the lines elsewhere. They have great lobby art and pretty darn good sales (don't pay more than $250 per night, and look for sub-$200 rates!). Finally, at the top of THEHotel, THEMix provides awesome views of the entire strip! We also really like its location at the very south end of the strip -- it's far quieter and less crowded than places like New York New York and MGM, and there is an excellent range of good and affordable places to eat, whereas we find other hotels to have either lots of bad-smelling fast food or too many exclusive luxury restaurants we can only walk by and sigh. There is a tasteful and uncrowded mall attached to it that is lit with natural light, and provides more pleasant spaces for walking and eating (try the great burget bar). The Luxor is a nice neighbor casino to walk through and prepare before you hit the insanity of Excalibur and beyond... For us, THEHotel is the best of Vegas -- it's glamorous but private, it's close to excitement but not in the thick, it retains normalcy but you've still got all the vices in reach. :)", "Date": "June 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ohio", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful\u201d", "Author": "cjuOhio", "ReviewID": "UR114834673", "Content": "I was surprised to see this ranked so low but I assume it's because it's not exactly a value.

I can say that it was just as good in 2011 as it was in 2010. For those who complain about the pool and other areas not being family friendly, it is clear that they would prefer to find paradise on a remote island. Yes, there are a lot of people at the wave pool and it can be a challenge to find a place to sit, but if you plan accordingly, you can have a great time with you and your children (show-up early, use one lunge chair instead if 4+, rent a cabana, etc.). Also, the service is 2nd to none -- need a blanket, roll away bed, sink draining slow....all can be taken care of with a quick phone call. You will also notice that after a day of sight seeing or and evening of gambling, it is nice to head back to THEhotel where it is very quiet and peaceful. THEhotel has its own lounge with pool tables, cafe and breakfast area as well as a store with anything you could need. It is more convenient than fighting the crowds at Manadaly Bay. Key tips -- use the tram from Manadaly Bay to Excalibur when working your way up the strip to MGM/Ny-NY or beyond. There is also a tram from the Mirage/Aria to Bellagio. Tip #2 -- make reservations for the restaurants at Mandalay Bay/THEhotel/Shops at Manadalay Place or any other destination -- this eliminates the 1-2 hour wait on a weekend or when a convention is in town. We have children that are 10yrs or less in age and when asked whether they want to go to Disney or Vegas, it is Vegas. THEhotel and its convenience makes all of the difference.

The entire Mandalay Resort Property is really lovely. TheHotel suites, in particular, are extremely spacious, beautifully decorated and immaculate. Every staff member we encountered was extremely friendly and professional. Everyone seemed very sincere and truly did their best to insure we had an enjoyable stay. Would we stay there again, in a heartbeat. This being said, there are a couple of issues I would like to see addressed. First, when I made the reservation I specifically asked the reservationist if the hotel had pack-n-plays or cribs for babies to sleep in. She said they had cribs and confirmed one for our infant granddaughter. When we got to our room a pack-n-play was delivered. We were informed that they only use these and do not have cribs. Yet, even in the guest room amenities book, it reads cribs, not pack-n-plays are available. Secondly, like many of the hotels are doing nowadays, a daily resort fee ($20) was added to our hotel bill. I object to this because it covers many of the things that were complimentary in the past, i.e. local and 800 # phone calls, WIFI, newspaper, entrance to fitness center. Two complimentary drinks per room, per STAY, were also included. This fee is tacky and gives one the impression of \"nickle and diming\" the guest. If the hotel feels the need to charge $20 to cover the exoense for these services, they should just include it in the room rate and not show it as a resort fee. Lastly, each suite comes with a lovely coffee maker, including premium coffee packets and an assortment of teas. However, this is not complimentary. To charge me $4 for the convenience of brewing myself a cup of coffee seems a bit steep!! I've read some negative reviews about the lack of beach chaises and the $20 purchase charge for the swim tubes to use in the Lazy River. Yes, even though our stay was during the week, we had to go down early to find a few chaises together. As far as the tubes, some people had their own personal tubes and there didn't seem to be any objection from the staff. They just had to be the same size or smaller as the resorts. Overall, we had the BEST time and our five day stay went by much too quickly.

We have never been to Vegas before and this hotel made everything perfect for us. Yes, its a long way from the middle, but honestly we never had any problems with that at all. Our feet were a bit sore at the end of the stay but we wanted to look at everything. The hotel has a tram service which connects 3 casinos and from there it is an easy walk to NYNY and then cross the road to the MGM Grand where you can catch the monorail down the rest of the strip, so the distance isn't really a problem. It was actually quite nice to return to theHotel for a bit of peace and quiet. As for the room it was very nice. We had a bit of a problem when we arrived as our travel agent in Australia cancelled our booking for some strange reason so theHotel had no room for us. After a lot of complaining and showing them we actually had paid in full and had the voucher with us they found us a room, even though they said they were full. However, we were put on the 5th floor with a view of the carpark and an air-conditioning unit. The room was clean, very comfortable and had a lovely bathroom with a really deep bath. We were able to change rooms once our travel agent contacted theHotel on Monday, although after seeing our new room on the 38th floor we decided to stay with the 5th floor one (strange move I know!). Our reason being was that the 5th floor one was actually a lot bigger and it was a lot quieter. The 38th floor one was under the Mix nightclub which was really loud. We ordered room service and found this to be very tasty and was delivered really fast. The only negative we had was with the belldesk. When we checked out we asked them to hold our luggage. I told them that one of our suitcases had a very fragile item in it that I had purchased in Disneyland for my daughter in Australia. I made it so clear to them that they needed to lie the bag down flat. Within 10 minutes of them having the bags I realised that I had left something in this bag so went back to get it and the item was broken. They must have simply thrown the bags down. I was so upset with them that I screamed at them (probably a bit over the top but I can't go back to Disneyland to get another one). The manager of the front services was very good about it. He was most apologetic but of course it doesn't replace the article. They did credit us the resort fee. If you stay here, make sure you get your VIP tickets to the Mix nightclub on the top floor.

I've stayed at the Mandalay Bay and that was pretty nice but the better half said that THEhotel is way awesome and after our most recent stay, I'll have to agree. During our last adventure to Vegas, I made reservations to stay here. I like how the hotel is secluded, not in terms of it's proximitiy on the Strip, but the location of the front desk and elevators. It's like, if you're walking through there, you're a hotel guest otherwise, you're really lost. When checking in, there was a long line, but every Vegas hotel has a line, so that was expected. When I got to the desk, this handsome but cocky gentleman in his early 20's checked me in. You can tell that he and the other desk agents check in hundreds of people a day so, you're pretty much dealing with a person immune to any personality that conveys the most minimal amount of genuine hospitality. You're a number, not a guest, which is too bad with a hotel distinguished with a AAA Four-Diamond rating. The elevator bank had 6-7 elevators but the cabs were quite small, thankfully they don't stop at every floor otherwise we were screwed. When we got to the room, I mean, \"THEsuite,\" it was exactly how it looked like online. A living room area w/a wet bar and half bath; a bedroom and a bathroom with a stand-in shower, soaking tub, dual vanity and a private toilet. THEsuite wasn't elegant like the Venetian or plush as the Wynn but it was more trendy, if anything. Now I can see why the better half liked it, the decor were dark woods and clean lines. The bed was quite comfortable and the bath amenities were awesome. I didn't like however when our room was serviced, they replaced all our bath amenities which were barely used, with brand new ones. IMO, that was quite wasteful. Speaking of which, during our stay, we were in our room around 12pm when a housekeeping representative called to see if we wanted our room serviced, because we had the Do Not Disturb sign illuminated. I asked her what was the latest and she said the housekeepers go home at 4pm. What? For such a large hotel, you won't have one or two housekeepers on duty beyond that time? Really now?

We came back 30 mins, still not ready. it is almost 8:30 pm now. We were given a meal drink voucher for $100 to spend in the hotel, but keep in mind, it is concerning us now.

The manager admitted it was \"unacceptable\", and again offered us more complimentary services to compensate for our scare.

This time we decided on THEhotel because the Mr. heard good things about the beach/pool area and since it's his Bday, I let him do the picking. THEstaff: everyone was very friendly and generally very helpful. After battling a 7 hour traffic from OC to Vegas, we were pooped by the time we checked in. The nice lady upgraded us without my request. Very nice and thoughtful. Off we went. THEsuiteS (yes, two): First suite: HUGE was our first impression. Nice view from the room. Separate living room and bedroom. 1.5 bathroom. I didn't even realize the door on the hallway was a bathroom till the second night. I thought it was a closet. Planned on stashing my shopping haul in there, but obviously that wouldn't work. I have nothing bad to say about this room. You wonder why we moved? Well, the club on 60th floor was a killer!!!! We're in the higher floor and we could hear the music loud and clear as if it's coming from our room. First night, I was pooped, so I didn't hear it at all, but the Mr did. Second night, it kept both of us up all night long. When we called downstairs to find out what time the club normally closed, before we even said anything, THEstaff said, \"the music is too loud?\" Looks like this is a known-fact. He suggested we moved to a different tower and lower floor the next day. Second Suite: The move was smooth. By noon, they already had an open room available, so we're already in there by 12:30. We moved from one elevator to another. Bumped into another person who was doing the same thing. The first thing I noticed, even though the room looked identical, they really weren't. This one was definitely smaller. Not a lot smaller, but unless you're obsessive compulsive like I am, you probably won't notice. What they offer at the mini bar area also differed slightly... no $8 cup of coffee in this room (not that I was planning on paying for that). Honestly, I wouldn't pay extra to upgrade to the first room since this room is just as nice. No club music at night, so yay! Good night sleep finally. So the moral of the story is, yes, higher floor = nicer view. But it also means, you stay up all night listening to Black Eyed Peas boomboompowing. If that's what you go to Vegas for, by all means, but that's not what I go to Vegas for, so this is a big deal for me. Remember to ask for lower floor tower if you want to sleep. Minor comment on housekeeping: dust bunnies! gross! Thank God for slippers they provide you in the room. I wouldn't want to walk around barefoot. THEcafe: $5 for white chocolate mocha. Pretty good actually. Beats the $3 for the crappy Kcup in the room. THEbeach/pool: They open at 9AM. We got there at 8:56AM and the line wrapped around. By 9:20, all the chairs are gone.

There is a tv in the living room. There is a tv in the bedroom. And there is a little tv in the main bathroom. Overall it's a big hotel room. Bed: They are comfy, but nothing spectacular.

Great amenities from Gilchrist & Soames: facial bar, bath soap, shampoo, conditioner, body balm, sewing kit, shoe polish, shower cap, bath crystals, but no shower gel. Still a lot though.

Location: Well, it's at the south end of the Strip, so you're not in the middle of the action. You have a bridge to take you to the Luxor, and a monorail to Excalibur. You kind of have everything you need here though. Pool: Holy cow, this place is always packed. There is a line that starts before 9am to get in. I got there at 10:45am, and I was extremely lucky to snag one chair. It's ridiculously busy. This is family friendly with a wave pool, a beach w/ actual sand, lazy river, and other secluded lagoon pools. Overall: It's a really nice hotel.

I did have a problem with my bedsheets appearing stained when I did my first once-over of the premises, so I had to have housekeeping come up and change them out. Oddly, my colleague staying in another room had the same problem. Not exactly something you want happening across multiple rooms. While at this hotel, I also experienced THEgym, the Mandalay Bay \"Beach\" and Mix Lounge. My pros and cons about my experience, below. Pros: - Quiet hotel. No problems falling asleep. - Can avoid casino/cigarette smoke with separate hotel entrance - THEgym is quiet and not crowded, has weights and cardio machines - Price is relatively cheap compared to other large hotel rooms - Coffee making facilities - Stylish, modern decor - HUGE bathrooms - Prompt housekeeping - Blackout curtains - Large closets and in-room safe - Prompt housekeeping - Pretty reliable WIFI CONS: - Could not decline housekeeping--despite pressing the do not disturb button beside the door every day (they do not give you a doorknob sign), housekeeping still showed up. - THEgym is NOT included in the resort fee; instead, it's an extra $!5 a day or $35 for 3 days. This is a bit annoying, since the resort fee includes the Cardio room a far walk away at the Mandalay Bay hotel (and that cardio room is like it says; no weights, very small, in my opinion not worth the fee at all). This strikes me as a bit of bait and switch. - Inconsistent sheet quality; several different nights I had experiences with odd stains on sheets, even after changed out. - Mix Lounge: this is a date scene with a great view, but not a fun club scene. Music is Gen X style. Luckily there appeared to be no cover, so you're not going to be out $20 if you don't like the atmosphere. - The Mandalay Bay Beach is big, packed full with beach chairs. I had a harder time trying to relax here than I have at other, smaller pools. Just know going in that you should go to be active (they have a nice lazy raft course) vs. go for a quiet nap at the beach. - No iron in room. Which was odd, because the Mandalay Bay Hotel rooms have irons...", "Date": "April 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "1", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington, D.C.", "Title": "\u201cStay somewhere else!\u201d", "Author": "AlexaR", "ReviewID": "UR104368586", "Content": "The hotel is known for having great pools.

Everything about it is beautiful and the staff is very friendly and helpful. We arrived at about 7:00pm or so and there was no line to check in so it only took us about five minutes or so. We were given a room in the 34th floor with a nice view of the large pool complex and Mandalay Bay. The rooms are large, nicely decorated, and welcoming. There are plenty of restaurants (House of Blues was my favorite) and shopping readily available as THEhotel is attached to Mandalay Bay and Mandalay Place, but it is nice and quiet at night since there is no casino in THEhotel. The beds are also very comfortable and there is a second bathroom which is handy. The two minor down sides are that THEhotel is set back about a block off of the strip at the far south end so it does add a bit of extra walking to your trip, but this is not a reason not to stay here. The one other thing is that they do chrage for the in room coffee. It is $8.00 for the first cup (since you buy the mug) and $4.00 for each refill. If you are looking for a nice mug as a souvenir though, it's not a bad way to go. There is also a $25.00 per day fee to store your own stuff in the bar, we didn't do this, but it seems pretty steep. We did encounter one minor problem while we were there and the coffee pot did not work (I discovered this the day before we left). They came and took it immediately and told us they would be back with a replacement so we headed out for the day. Unfortunately when we got back there was still no coffee pot so we called and they said it would be right up. After an hour it was still not there so we called again and they said they would have it up to us at 9:3am the nect morning. It was 10:38am the next day before we finally got the replacement coffe pot which would not have been a huge deal except and check out was at 11: 00am so I never did get to have my coffee. However, when I mentioned this to them at check out and said it wasn't a big deal the gentlman checking us out said yes it was and credited us one day's resort fee ($20.16) back. I thought that was more than fair for such a minor oversight and I am sure it was nothing more than that. I would definitely recommend this hotel as it was very comfortable and relaxing!", "Date": "April 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "hemel hempstead", "Title": "\u201cAmazing weekend in Vegas, Loved THE Hotel\u201d", "Author": "charlie1978", "ReviewID": "UR103986175", "Content": "My husband & I and another couple booked this hotel through Virgin Holidays and stayed there for 3 nights.

When you walk into the hotel you immediately feel calm and tranquil, which is quite amazing considering you are in vegas and everything is OTT. We upgraded our rooms to a large suite on the 12th floor, its was lovely and quiet and I am a very light sleeper but I heard no noise at all throughout our stay. We visited all the other big hotels such as the Wynn, venetian, ceasars etc and we felt THE Hotel was a tranquil haven away from the madness of the others. You really do feel relaxed walking around in THE Hotel. We went up to the Mix bar for drinks and the view is spectacular! you really must go and see it in the evening during your stay. If I have to be really picky my only complaint about THE Hotel was 1. having to pay for coffee your room and 2. having to pay $15 for wifi per day.

Bar and restaurant prices in the complex way too high.. On one day went to the verandah lounge at Four Seasons which is a short walk from check in at Mandalay Hotel. This was fantastic and although not cheap was excellent value for money, away from noise and razzamatazz . The service here was first class. Go you wont be dissappointed. Vegas was a great place to party. We had a good meal at Olives in Bellagio and the buffett at Wynn on a Sunday includes Champagne. The food quality here is fab. Outside mandalay is a bus stop to South Strip go to Town Square from here and you will find shops in a peacefull area and restaurant called Brio which was wonderfull. Better food than any of the top restaurants had served all week, unfortunatly we discovered this on our last day before heading to the airport late afternoon.

After lots of researching, The Hotel at Mandalay Bay seemed like a great pick. And let me tell you, it was! It amazes me how people can put negative reviews on this hotel. They are either not well traveled and have ridiculous expectations, they have never been to other Vegas hotels, or are stuck up, rich snobs that would never be satisified no matter where they stay. I have stayed at The Paris, Ceasers Palace, The Rio, Planet Hollywood etc and a few others, and THE Hotel knocks them all out of the park. I have been into the Wynn, Bellagio etc and they all seem very nice aswell and I am sure are just as nice. The thing that I really liked about The Hotel, was the cleanliness! Everytime we came down from our room there were 6 or more people with dust mops cleaning the floors and another 3 or 4 people dusting tables, ledges etc. This place smelt and looked clean 24/7. We could never smell any smoke and overall, this made a huge impression. I LOVE the fact you pull right up to the lobby, just like a regular hotel, so you can avoid the Casino etc. We arrived on a Thursday around 1pm....we were upgraded to a V Suite free of charge. We requested a room with a view of the strip and on the quiet side of the hotel. We were given exactly that. The V Suite is awesome, as the layout is better than the standard room as the bedroom curves around the corner of the building. The room we had was 32916 and I highly recommend this room. Nice view of the strip and corner view. ***PLEASE NOTE, if you are looking for a quiet room, make sure you request to be on the wing of the builidng that is not below THE MIX nightclub.*** As soon as we walked in the room, I knew I picked the right hotel. Very clean and tidy, seperate living room with flat screen tv (with extra bathroom) and the bedroom was a nice size, with an amazingly comfortable bed and pillows, another flat screen tv, and a view of the strip from the bed with floor to celing windows wrapping around the entire unit. The bathroom was nice and big, with a nice deep soaker tub, shower and another bathroom with a privacy door. It also had a smaller flat screen tv for watching tv while in the bath! Very nice! I have to address some of the issues that people have brought up on the review board. #1- Hotel is far away from the strip.....ok, it is farther away than other hotels but I would not say it is far away from the strip....$10 cab ride (8 mins) and your on the strip....come on people #2- The Hotel is far away from the Casino in Mandalay.....again, you come down the elevator, walk 2 mins to the left and your in the Casino....if you can't walk that far, you need help....one of the best aspects of staying at The Hotel, is the ability to have the nice clean, quite Hotel side, and then head over to Mandalay for the Casino etc. Overall, this hotel is top notch. If you have booked this hotel, you are going to be very pleased. But remeber, this hotel is less for partying people and more for the people looking to relax or have the ability to relax. It is not right on the strip so if this is an issue, don't stay here.", "Date": "April 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bowie, Maryland", "Title": "\u201cGood Hotel...

Free wi Fi, lush soft mattresses on huge beds, free extra soft robes, etc etc. Very very nice. Also free parking which is always good and we hired a car to go to the canyon so that was handy. The actual hotel is a separate building to the Mandalay bay itself but it only takes a moment to walk across. Mandalay bay is where the casino and pool and most other amenities are such as restaurants, buffets etc. There are a couple of cafes in THE hotel but you are close enough to everywhere to be able to have the choice as to where to go. The hotel is on the south of the strip very very close to the airport. Infact you will be a stones throw from the hotel when you land, so very quick transfer times also. The hotel has a free monorail from Mandalay bay to the Luxor and the Excalibur which takes only a minute, or you can walk. We walked a lot of the time as the weather was lovely and why wouldn't you ? However most people over there didn't walk much and you will see clearly what I mean when you go! There is so much to see and do in las Vegas I wAs surprised and never for a second bored. We managed to cram so much in to 4 days. If you are going then the Hoover Sam and canyon are a must if you have never been before. Hoover dam by car is about 35 miles. Great pictures!! The shows are amazing!! Check out 'o' at the bellagio. Other free must sees whilst you are there include the wonderful fountains of bellagio show. Outside the bellagio hotel on the strip, it's a water fountain show to music and it's fabulous. Also, the volcano show at night at the mirage hotel is well worth 10 mins of your time. Last show at 11pm! They feed lions at the MGM grand hotel throughout the day, worth popping in for ten mins. There is a monorail that goes from the MGM grand hotel right up to the north of the strip it's 5 dollars single ride. We did it for the experience but if there are a few of you it's cheaper and faster to get a taxi. The fares are all set by the government so very fair. Back to the hotel, there are lots to choose from on the strip and some look very tacky indeed. This hotel wasn't at all. It's five star, comfortable and well cleaned with all the little luxuries thrown in for free. The only pain is the 18 dollar per room per day resort fee. They all charge it though so don't blame this hotel too much and some fees are more than this. Luckily if you book through virgin holidays for either the package or hotel only, as we did, you don't have to pay them!! I could go on about this lovely place but the phone battery is about to die. Happy to answer any hotel or location questions just send a message! Oh, don't use the mini bar it's a complete rip off, don't even accept the key from reception when they offer it!!

Anyways, this is still a fine facility and I still enjoy my time here. It's so nice to not have a casino directly attached to theHotel. It's SO much quieter and more relaxing - yet you can walk into a casino in 2 minutes. I got the standard suite this time, not the \"V\" as in my previous review. Mostly similar, but I noticed one big thing - the beds are different. The \"V\" had the nicer bed. While it wasn't bad, it just wasn't as comfortable as the \"V\" bed, which I believe are pillow-top. Housekeeping is still top notch, as we spilled some M&M's and when we came back the next night, they were gone - even the ones that we saw run under the couch. Would love it if they got HD tv's - but once again, I know where MGM's money is. The staff is still excellent. What needs to be improved is the condition of the building. There are tell tale signs of wear. There are chips on the dresser doors, visible scratches on tables, bubbled up wall paper in places, and just little signs that the place is not as new as it was. I am confident these things will be taken care of in time, after the parent company can pay down its debt on City Center. It's easy for me to recommend this place AS LONG as you get a good deal - if it gets priced like a 5-star place, I'd stay at Wynn/Encore. But for the deal I got, I'm perfectly okay with it and will be back if I can get the deal again. And BTW, I hate resort fees, and they had them. But just about everyone does, now.

After we had them address this we could not sleep for half the night due to the noise from upstair. The next day they moved us to a suite (free upgrade for our trouble) down on a lower floor. Suite was nice although the sheet was stained (about 2 by 3 inches) and ripped (about 2 inches). That night we continued to hear noise although not as bad. Also we were nearby the elevator but luckily the noise from people going up and down the corridor only made it into the living room portion of the suite not the bedroom section. We also booked the SPA at the mandalay Bay Hotel (Not The Hotel). From last year we noticed, the individual juices, water bottle and nuts are gone. Only ice water and juice as well as banana and apples. Not that bad BUT we the place was not heated as much, had less attendants, the whirlpool were much cooler and on the last day they ran out of towels halfway through the afternoon. So it was one towel for person but with no warnings, so when you looked for a clean one they informed you on this. It was Superbowl week end and UFC night but still no excuse to run out of towels. So while they did all these cuts in service, they also increased the price. Ate at the Raffles cafe which was ok and at something Lilly which was very good. We used to like the Mandalay (Hotel or not) before because of the non-thematic aspect and the spa. We will not stay at THEhotel again due to noise.

I'm sure with hundreds of rooms to clean, not every cubby area in the bathroom got a wipedown, so yes I saw a little dust from time to time. It didn't bother me. The Hotel is quiet! Very well insulated. We were on the 30th floor with a great view of the Luxor and strip. What we liked the best, besides the extra room, was the HUSH that engulfs you when you leave the gambling area of Mandolay and walk back to THE Hotel. It's like an instant calming effect. The tub was wondereful! Husband and I brought our own bath products, but used them all up by day 3. Luckily their is a Lush store in their shopping area so we just bought more. Staff was friendly and cooperative. Didn't experience anyone rude or impatient. We used the guest services to check our bags and flight before we left, a free service they have at the hotel.

Mandalay Bay Casino is a 5 minute walk. Parking: Tons Restaurants: Lots of restarurant and entertainment choices at the attached Mandalay Bay.

The bedroom was huge and the bath humungous! I like to be able to relax when I am away and youcan do this in the suite very well because the lounge is separate to the bedroom and the 42\" TV and DVD player were put to good use, as was the cocktail bar in the suite! In the casinos I met many locals who told me they came to the Mandalay Bay complex because the staff are so welcoming. The location is a little away from the action, but this suits me and there is a tram to Exccalibur. Also if you are taking the Downtown Express or the Deuce, these leave outside the resort. Very convenient. Also very handy for Wholefoods Market at Town Square. The resort has about 16 restaurants and bars. The buffet was poor, but all the other places I went to were excellent. Raffles Cafe was very popular with long queues, but as the Mandalay Bay is connected toi Luxor, more resturants are just a few minutes walk away and this proved helpful for late supper.

We booked this hotel because I am a travel agent, and I noticed they were having a sale, so we all booked. Let me preface this review, as I always do, with the fact that I am picky, not high maintenance, but high expectations.The Hotel side is very nice and has a swanky, upscale feel about it. Check in was decently speedy for the line. The hotel suites were liked by everyone in the group. They are well appointed, nicely decorated, nice views, and very clean. Cleaning service was prompt. There were a couple of minor service issues on the first night, but Jenna, one of the managers, took care of the problems and compensated us, which was the right thing to do. The Hotel is connected to the Mandalay Bay resort, which is a very short walk away, and it has everything: shopping, restuarants, bars, and gambling. You really don't even need to leave the resort. Of course we did, but it really has everything. There are several FANTASTIC restaurants at this resort. We had a couple of foodies in our group, so we tried several of the restaurants in the Mandalay Bay Resort and were pleased.For morning coffee, walk down to the lobby and get a large cup of coffee for half the price,and get a delicious breakfast treat, like a muffin or sticky bun. Don't use the mini bar in the room because like most upscale hotels, everything is ridiculously priced. There is a daily resort fee, but these are common and not unique to The Hotel. Like baggage fees on airlines, everyone is trying to get in their extra fees. It's maddening, but part of travel these days. If you don't want to pay them, check your hotel policy before you book or ask your travel agent. The location of The Hotel is on the far end of the strip. We knew this going in, but we chose this hotel for the quality and sale. It is a lot of walking, but you really should expect that in Vegas if you like to see all the hotels. I have and still would recommend The Hotel to clients. The rooms were really great. I would wait for this property to go on sale before I booked because the location is inconvenient, or if you are looking for a high end hote,l but need it on sale.

The resort fee has gone up to $20 a day. So now you know. It was $15 at the time of our booking. That's about all the negative I have. People are on here complaining about things like having to pay $6 per cup of coffee in your room. Well, it took me 5 minutes to go to the lobby and buy a fresh cup for $2.75. People sometimes! So another big complaint is how far away it is from everything. Well, it's not really.

I for one loved being away from the crowds and those annoying scumbags handing out prostitution paraphernalia at every corner. Anyway, we loved it!

Our room was extremely quiet, though I was very disappointed in the lumpy mattress! If the Marriott can do it in their mid-priced hotels, why can't Mandalay Bay have a decent mattress? There weren't enough pillows (only two) or any extra blankets in the room, so you'd have to get it from housekeeping and we just didn't. We were not in our room too much, but when we were we wished it had a coffee maker that you wouldn't have to pay the mini-bar prices to use. Also, though we weren't in the room much, when we were we noticed the TVs look nice but the service is terrible. Fuzzy picture and only a few \"free\" channels. One of the days, it was over 80 degrees, so we spent most of it at the pool -- which I have mixed feelings about. Our friend rented a cabana -- which was great, I recommend this. However, only the wave pool/lazy river were open. The other pools were closed for the season. You pay an extra $15 resort fee per day and it is irksome when part of it is closed. Also irritating was that the cardio room is included in the room fee, but it is an extra $15 per person to use the fitness center.

So, the waiter could tell I was pissed off and he sent for the manager. I told him our story and he very quickly cleared off a table along the window and we had a very nice view. I thought the prices were outrageous, but, the food was good so we chalked it up to the experience. We also ate at Aureole and that was quite good also. Once again, very high prices, but thats normal for a Michelin rated restaurant. I thought the staff was very helpful and pleasant. What I was shocked at was the prices at Il Mulino in Ceasar's Palace Forum. My husband had ravioli stuffed with mushrooms and a champagne cream sauce - it was a special so we didn't know the price - that was $46.00 when the bill came. That is absolutely rediculous! I don't mind paying the price for good food, but it was ok at best, and the most rediculous price I have ever heard of for pasta. I had penne with ricotta and that was $26.00.

We didn't ask for anything while we were there besides complaining to a manager about our mix experience which was flat out awful, and the girl at the front desk had us sit for 25 min in the lobby waiting for one. When no one came, and I told her we were gonna be on our way, there was no offer of \"we will call your room, or come back at a certain time.\" I guess they assumed everything was ok. Here is my review/experience of mix and see if you think its ok.....(its a tad long, but entertaining I promise): So you know where I stand, I have taken 5 trips to vegas and and have never ever spent less than $1000 in one night between dinner and clubs, I go to have fun. I visited mix in the afternoon on my last trip to vegas in august of 2010 and thought the view was incredible. I was on that trip with some buddies and decided it would be a great place to take my girlfriend back to. I read the reviews and looked at the menu on the web, which looked a little dismal to begin with, but with her I was more concerned about the experience. Let me say I am not a picky person, and am very easy to please, in fact I have never even written a review before on tripadvisor...but it was a must after this debacle. I requested a table with a view 2 weeks in advance. Not to be picky but if your going to eat at the top of a hotel, this is kind of a no brainer. The 1st table they seated us was behind a pole with both seats facing the interior, I could see right there I was dealing with some real geniuses here. We got moved to one with a slight view when we stood up, but sadly most of the tables by the windows have you on top of another couple where you pretty much have to wait until they are done talking to speak, otherwise you would interrupt each other. The bus boy then poured our water only half way up in each glass...and I wondered why when he had a full pitcher. We found out after he left the table....he farted. The couple next to us smelled it too..disgusting. We got over this and just decided to make the best of it. The food: Terrible and overpriced. They obviously do a lot of cooking in the microwave. We had a couple apps which probably only made us even more hungry, and were so small I think they actually had a negative caloric value if that's possible. I live on Hilton Head Island which has excellent seafood restaurants and I don't think one of them charges $39 for a piece of fish. Someone needs to contact Vandekamps and let them know this place has stolen their frozen fish stick recipe and disguised it as chilean sea bass. It was not the price, I promise. It was the value, and satisfaction. I had one of the best meals of my life at Prime in the Bellagio the next night and paid $450 for 2, and would have paid double it was so good. I told them they can have the fish back and didn't even ask to replace it. The only thing even done after that was a man(if you can call him that) came over and in one long-winded, run-on sentence all in broken English said \"I will take the fish off of your bill we will bring you something on the house for dessert.\" He walked off immediately, maybe even as he was mumbling. No pauses, no sorry bout the fish, not even a anything we can do? By his mannerisms he was clearly afraid to confront what was wrong and if I might have had some resolution. It was hard to watch them bring me the bill for $145 as my hunger pains were pounding inside me. $145 and they even took off one of the entrees. I was hoping my girlfriend had crackers in her purse but was not that lucky. I will never set foot in this place again knowing our cat eats consistently better than the patrons of this dump. It's funny the thing right below the review asks if I would recommend this place to a friend, you have to really not like someone to recommend this place. Go to prime/or del friscos, best in vegas. I informed the girl at the front desk that I had never written a review on here before<but would if something is not done and she pretty much could have cared less. But then again, we did think she might have been high, or still coming down from the night before. Regardless, she could have cared less. When someone comes all the way from the other side of the country to visit and is only in town for 3 days, time is money and we were just wasting it sitting there for nothing. I would go back to THE hotel if I thought they at least made an effort to resolve the situation.

Guess what it costs, with no Tip... 18 DOLLARS! yes 18 Dollars! 2 normal glasses of diet coke off TAP (pump) ... 9 Dollars! 1 Coffee in the room, making it yourself with hotwater etc.. 7 dollars! in the 6 days we played in there Casina ( around 2 hours each day) we were approached twice by Waiting staff, and the 3rd time she forget where we were, and we never saw her ( yes we tipped everyone well! usually 5 dollars.) In releation to the Comps we spent over 2k in there Casino alone, and we were given about 40 dollars in comps. ( Not expecting much as they have the worse comps on the strip.. Advised on many many sites ) WARNING! You must make sure you have in EMAIL or screen printer your costs for the hotel. They dont honour there prices. When we booked it was $129 Exc Tax, and resort Fees of $15 Dollars, which adds to about $150 a night......... THERE IS A BIG HOWEVER! This is NOT what you pay per night, unless you book via a holiday company, you are at the whim of the hotel on its pricing. When checking in, I was advised they were busy, and that the rate would be honoured on the first night, but on the other nights it was $189 per night EXC Tax and resort fees,,, only after a long discussion and almost being called a lier did they bother to change the rate, and even then it only went to 169 per night EXC. So Folks.. DONT stay here if you are on a budget. I have paid many hundreds of euros for a hotel per night to stay, and can afford it.

Each one has its pros and cons. I don't expect perfection, but I do expect a clean room, friendly service personnel, and a good rate. Stayed on Nov. 4 & 5. Had two suites, one of which was comped and the other was at a casino rate (through the MGM Players Club) of $99 for Thursday night and $119 for Saturday. I was a little worried due to some of the reviews. I am not easily pleased and I thought the entire experience was worthy of a high rating. Every service person we encountered was friendly and helpful. We asked for more towels to be brought up to our room both days and they arrived within 10 minutes or less - each time, we received a call confirming that our towels arrived. The person bringing the towels seemed appreciative to receive a tip, didn't seem as if it was expected. At one point 3 of us were in a hallway waiting for our friends to come out of their room, and one of the maintenance guys took the time to stop and make sure everything was ok. No problems with housekeeping. We switched our light from 'do not disturb' to 'housekeeping' and the room was clean when we came back to dress for the evening. Pros: Suite was roomy and clean with two bathrooms. The size of main bathroom was great - liked having separate bath and shower. Plenty of space for cosmetics, lotions, etc. Liked the large flat panel TV in the living area. Check in was smooth and calm, not chaotic like most of the other casino hotels. There was place to get coffee, danish, sandwiches, etc. just at the bottom elevators - a HUGE plus. Distance from Thehotel to the Mandalay Bay casino was not bad. We've stayed at The Signature Suites a couple of times, and even though we really like the property, the distance to the MGM casino can be a bit of a pain. Mix Lounge at the top of Thehotel was awsome. I've been wanting to visit for the last few years, but never found the time to get to that far end of the strip. It was top priority this time and I'll be sure to do it again. Went on Thursday eve, just after they opened at 5. Was a good time to arrive as we had our choice of where to sit (we chose the outside patio). By 5:45 or so, the patio was full and the inside was quite busy. So nice to watch the strip come to life with all the lights. Cons: First place I've stayed where I could easily hear people in the hallways, doors opening and closing, people upstairs and next door when they entered their room. I expect noise at all hours of the day and night, that's what Vegas is all about, but this was loud enough that it was hard to ignore. I slept on the couch, so might not have been as loud in the bedroom, would that keep me from staying again - no. With exception to Luxor and Excalibur, takes time to get from here to other locations. We spent a good amout of our two days walking from here to there. Its not the walking for me that's a problem, its the wasted time, I only had two days : ). The lack of affordable places to eat onsite was also missed. That won't be a con for everyone, but for my weekend trip, I don't use a lot of my Vegas budget of time and money on high end restaurants and food. The lighting in the bathroom off the bedroom wasn't the best for hair and makeup : ). The smaller bathroom was better.

I have always enjoyed it but this time there were some glitches and problems that just made it less enjoyable than I prefer. The problems centered around my door lock. It was showing a blinking yellow light when I tried to unlock the door. This apparantly indicates that the dead bolt is in use although I was on the outside of the room and was the only guest for that room. Facilities was contacted by the front desk at 11:20 am the first time it happened and the door was fixed at 1:20pm later that day. That night, the problem started again. I could not get in my room at 10:30pm. Security and Facilities was called by the front desk and the first response was around 11:15 pm. I was in the room by 11:30 but Facilities didn't show up until 11:45. The door was fixed by 12:15 am. THere were a couple of other issues with the room that were not as inconvenient. One is that the shower stall leaked (not at the door gasket but I think at the seal around the shower base) so after taking a shower, the floor by the bathroom door would have standing water. Not the end of the world after I noticed it the first time (by sliding on it but not falling). Finally, the bed was not as comfortable as others in town. I think it is just wearing out. There were some nice parts of the hotel experience also. The front desk people who helped me with my door issues were friendly and empathetic. Also, the casual restaurants at Mandalay were very good and staffed with friendly people. The room itself is still nice. A real suite with a nice tub (but no jets). I prefer other places to this one as I am also not a fan of the Mandalay casino. A lack of luck and dealers who are not always overtly friendly can put a damper on things. (Also, this is usually hooker heaven late at night which I find offputting.) There are better hotels on and off the strip and unless you have a meeting at Mandalay, I would try someplace else.

We enjoyed THEhotel very much. We consider the location be a bonus as it is in what we considered the nicer part of town and felt very close to everything. It takes no time at all to go from Mandalay Bay to the Excaliber three doors down the strip. The only complaint is that the tram between Mandalay Bay, Luxor & Excaliber seems to close down too early (like 10pm weekdays and 11pm weekends) which is ridiculus if you go to a late show and have to end up walking back to your hotel after a full day of exploring - but in reality this isn't the hotels fault. Loved the huge bathtub with it's little waterfall spout and the fact that we had two toliets in the suite. Bedding was nice. Decor was pleasing. The buffet was awesome. They give you a his & hers robe & slippers to wear in your room as well as bath salts for the tub along with the standard soaps, shampoo, conditioner, sewing kit, shoe buffer, showercap, and hair dryer. Hubby loved all the mirrors in the room's decor too. I really liked the fragrance they pipe into the hotel too. I couldn't place what the smell was and when I asked the front desk they wouldn't divulge the secret :) We didn't get a chance to get to the pool/beach which is unfortunate, but I hear it closes at like 5pm. That seems really too early to me but I can't complain since I didn't use it I guess. We also couldn't find it from our wanderings from our hotel but after review of the property map we realized you have to access it from the other hotel - Mandalay. I wasn't all that pleased with the view from our room but after further inspection from outside on the street level I could tell that the bigger Mandalay Bay hotel would block the view of the strip and pool so I settle for the view of the far off mountains, freeway, and view of the Rio and Palms. I enjoyed the shopping connected to the hotel at Mandalay Place. I think I visited Lush every night for bath supplies.

Alas, our expectations were shattered. When we reserved, we made a point to say that we were coming to celebrate my 40th birthday, and the reservations agent assured us that this would be \"recognized\" at the thotel. We mentioned it at check-in (and tipped), and asked for the nicest room available. We were given a perfectly OK room, but on a low floor and with no view - clearly not an upgrade. Then, not one thing was done during our entire stay to recognize my birthday. We also had asked about the beach and pool when we booked, and were assured that everything was on full schedule in mid-October. But on our arrival, we learned that there is no longer a pool at TheHotel (or it was closed for the winter - we didn't get a clear answer to that), the Mandalay Bay pools closed at 6pm and stopped serving drinks at 5 even though it was 90 degrees out, and the Moorea Beach Club was closed during the week. A huge disappointment. Three times, we asked the concierge for restaurant suggestions. The first (a guy) was obnoxious and treated us like we were idiots to ask for suggestions at all. The second (a woman) acted like we were wasting her time by asking for suggestions or information. The third time, the same woman was there. We asked her to help us make a reservation for our birthday celebration dinner. She was extremely rude about it, but did make a couple of calls. We decided to go to Olives, and while she reluctantly booked us a table, she REFUSED even to ask them to seat us outside, and said it was \"up to the restaurant.\" The room itself was fine - a very spacious suite with nice furniture and a really nice, big bathroom. But aside from having good space and \"looks,\" the room was nothing special. The soaking tubs don't have jets, which would have been a nice touch. The lighting was terrible - even with every light in the suite on, it was extremely dim. The sheets very rough, poor quality, the towels felt thin, and even the toilet paper was rough and cheap-feeling. The housekeeping was spotty - some days, our bathroom amenities were only partially replaced (with no apparent logic to how), and at least one day, some of our towels and the bathmat were not replaced (dirty ones were taken, but no clean ones left). We played several nights in the Mandalay Bay casino, and on two of those nights, even though it wasn't very busy, and our table was one of the few with many occupied chairs, we waited for over an hour without a single cocktail waitress approaching the table.

I booked a \"V Suite\" knowing almost nothing about the hotel except that other reviews described it as quiet, modern and chic, and that their V Suite was less expensive than similar rooms at Encore, the Wynn, etc. I wasn't in Vegas to gamble or see the shows, I was there to relax in a fabulous room & a fabulous hotel. I was ELATED with my room. The photos on the website don't quite do it justice. Every detail was perfect: the fantastic honey-orange scented toiletries (including bath salts!), the two different kinds of incredible bathrobes!, the jar of cotton balls & cotton swabs, the lights on dimmer switches, the his & hers slippers, the good quality full size hair dryer...I could go on. The fantastic bed & bedding, the color palette, the SILENCE of the bathtub draining ( I mean, totally silent!), the silent AC... The suite was large and gorgeous. And the bathroom is to die for--biggest, deepest bathtub you can imagine. I booked this suite primarily because other described the bathtub as being huge and I was not disappointed! The decor and ambience of the rest of the hotel is calm, modern, upscale, low key. The Spa is beautiful--I toured it but didn't have enough time for treatments. Next time I definitely will. The room service food was excellent (the baked gruyere mac & cheese for $8 is a fantastic deal!) and not ridiculously overpriced. Huge cobb salad for $18, to give you an idea. Drawback: it does take forever to get room service. When they say 45 minutes, they mean it. It always took 40-45 minutes, even just for a pot of coffee, even at 5:00 am! The coffee bar in the lobby area has many items like cookies, coffee, salads and sandwiches packaged to-go, so if you don't feel like waiting for room service, try there. The peanut butter cookie is the bomb! Friendly staff, everyone seemed very accomodating. If you're looking for a quiet, upscale place to chill out for a couple of days, this is it, in a V Suite.

Request for change, told impossible, and \"maybe\" for the next day. The telephone in the room did not work.

Five hours after room change I was informed by a clueless front desk person that my room change was now available. Shower did not work; repaired after only two calls.

Check In - When I first arrived I walked down the hallway to the front desk and assumed I would have a quick check in as there were only 2 people ahead of me at the desk. This was not the case. There 6-7 people working the desk. 2 were helping a guest, and the others were just sitting around. There must have been some issues ahead of me because both guests were there for about 15 minutes each. My check in process took 5 minutes so the grand total was about a 20 minute check in. This was completely unacceptable. Room- Room was wonderful. Very clean. The only flaw I found was some dirty around the cracks of the bathtub, and the only reason I found it is because I look. Just something I do since being in the hospitality business. Nice lay out, two double beds, separate living area with desk and three flat screens (1 in the bed room, 1 in the living room and a small one in the bathroom). I had no view, just a parking lot, but that was no problem since I wasn't there to be in my room. Service \u2013 EXTREMELY poor. I got back to my room on the second night at about 2:00am and felt a little hungry. I called down to room service and place my order; she said fine 55 minutes and hung up. I called back 2 minutes later to cancel the order because I was not going to wait almost an hour for an sandwich and she put me on hold for 5 minutes and came back on the line and told me I could cancel but they were going to charge me as they already starting making the food. I asked are you sure they started since I just called. She said \u201cYes and it should be up soon\u201d. I said great and have a good night. 45 minutes later the food was still not there. I called the front desk and spoke to one of the managers. Very professional and told me I wouldn\u2019t be charged for it and it should be there any minute. I said no problem hung up, and 20 minutes later the food came. I couldn\u2019t complain it took much longer, it was free right? On the third night, a collage and I wanted to go grab a drink. Well everywhere you go in the casino they had out free drink coupons to their lounges. We walked into one, hand the bar tender the coupon and she said \u201cO, we don\u2019t take these\u201d as she threw it back to us and walked away. We were in shocked at the attitude she had. We went to the front desk and spoke to the manager who basically sat there, nodded her head and said she would pass it on to the F&B manager. What\u2019s the point to handing out drink coupons if they don\u2019t do anything? Needless to say, we went outside the casino/hotel for our cocktail. Check-Out- My last night there, I called before going to bed and ordered two wake up calls 5:30 and 5:45 as I had a shuttle picking me up at 6:15. Well, low and behold my blackberry goes off at 6:30 and wakes me up. I did not receive either one of the wake up calls. Rushed to get my stuff together and ran down to check out. Clerk was rude and insisted I received my wake up calls and told me I was wrong. He handed me my bill and can you guest what was on there? Yes, the room service fee. I told him I had the issue and his night manager told me it was going to be comp\u2019d. He again insisted I was wrong and told me I never spoke to a manager. As much as I wanted to stay there and argue, I had to get to the airport. Jumped outside and caught a cab. $20 later I was there. Also, I forgot to mention I had previously prepaid for that shuttle I over slept and missed. So it cost me a total of $40 dollars for a return ride to the airport. In summary, I feel that the service was unacceptable. THEhotel was clean, except for the hallway leading from the casino to THEhotel\u2019s lobby, always smelt like a dirty diaper. I think it was the cleaning chemicals they used, but besides that it was really clean. Unfortunately, clean only goes so far. It is service that really matters and they completely dropped the ball.

We stayed at the Excalibur that time. I was disappointed with how cool it looked on the outside, only to find 'motel' room like quality with the rooms inside. So when I decided to make my way back to Vegas, I wanted to do it right. Stay in some big fancy hotel, and really live it up. Bellagio was my first choice, but when I saw the online pics, again I got the motel layout feel. And for the money they wanted, I looked elsewhere. I finally settled on THEhotel, for the price you can't beat it. I love the living room and extra bathroom. PERFECT if you're not traveling alone. Everyone needs breathing room from one another from time to time right? It's in close proximity to three other hotels (Mandalay Bay, Luxor, Excalibur) with trams and connecting hallways between them. Very reasonable walking distance to hotels like MGM Grand. But you are on the south end of the strip, walking to somewhere like the Venetian may be a bit much. So rent a car, or make use of the monorail (Nearest station for you would be MGM Grand) an all day pass will run you $12 per person. One way trip $5 per person. Would I stay at THEhotel again? I don't know. Don't get me wrong, I LOVED it. It's soooo quiet. You're less than 5 minutes away from the casino in Mandalay Bay, but there is no casino in THEhotel. So the lobby, is always quiet. Pretty much no one outside of the guests, are walking around. It was really cool to walk from the hustle of the Mandalay Bay, to the soothing quiet of THEhotel. But there are two reasons why I'm debating if I'd ever go back. One, is the cost. Again don't get me wrong, for the price you get SO MUCH MORE than other hotels are asking for their suites. But for me personally, I just need a hotel room to sleep. I wanted to spoil myself once (And I'm glad I did!), but not sure I'd ever spend that kind of money again on a hotel room. Second issue, is its location. I may decide to stay more towards the center of the strip. My two trips to Vegas had me in hotels on the south end. So if I go back, it'd be nice to be in another spot. Overall, it was an amazing experience. One I don't regret. It really is a beautiful hotel.

We recieved an upgrade when we checked in which gave us a great strip view out of the bedroom. The room was very clean, with a huge bathroom with a huge bathtub and glass shower. There's a seperate living room with a TV and DVD player as well. TheHOTEL is seperate from Mandalay Bay, but just a short walk down the hall in the lobby and you're inside the casino at Mandalay Bay. I'm not a gambler, so I can't say much about the casino. There's more than enough to do at Mandalay Bay. House of Blues was great, Red White and Blue was very good and there's a nice sushi place. Make sure to check out Mix though, it's pricey but the views are great, make sure to have a drink at the lounge afterwards to get the best view. The pool is a short walk through the hotel, but the wave pool is nice lagoon that is away from some of the kids and another small pool. If you want a more adult vibe, check out Moorea Beach Club, it's not Rehab or Wet Republic, but it had good music and atmosphere. Any complaining you see about prices, take with a grain of salt, everything is pricey in Vegas. There are deals like the buffet at the hotel which was great for breakfast, but you're genereally going to overpay for drinks($7 beers, paid $19 for a drink at Surrender at Encore), food, or like we did for sunblock. There are deals, we got 2 for 1 drinks at Eyecandy in the casino the first night and happy hour drinks at resteraunts, but overall expect to overapy. The one downside is the location, but it's not as bad as you may think being at the end of the Strip. There are trams to the Luxor and the Excalibur, and then if you take a short walk to the Monte Carlo there is a tram inside there that takes you to City Center and down to Bellagio, so you can go quite a distance without walking in the heat too much. Cab rides aren't terrible, $10-$17 to about mid-strip and opposite end of the strip.

The Valet is awesome because it allows you to leave your car right at the hotel's entrance and when you come to get your vehicle, it takes only moments. THEHotel is connected to Mandalay Bay, so you have full access to all of the wonderful restaurants, clubs, shops, etc that Mandalay Bay is known for. The Lion King is playing at Mandalay Bay right now, so that was definitely a trip highlight for us, as was the House of Blues and the Phoenix 80's band that was playing on Fri and Sat in one of the bar areas. And, there is no beating the Wave pool and lazy river at Mandalay Bay. What a great atmosphere for hanging out and even over Labor Day weekend, the crowds were more manageable in this complex than any of the others that we visited while in Vegas.

The staff was very efficient and friendly..we asked for an upgrade when we arrived, and they were fully booked due to the Miss Universe pageant, so they gave us some free spa services instead, which was much more than we expected. The room was perfect..it had 1 1/2 bathrooms, and I definitely recommend taking a bubble bath in the super deep tub (which is huge!)..the bed was also really comfortable and there was a separate living room with a bar. Our room on floor 38 had a great view of the strip. My only complaint about the room was that we found a little bit of trash under the couch from the previous guest (gross). There is no casino at THEhotel, so we went to the one in Mandalay Bay, which was my favorite of all the casinos on the strip (including Bellagio, Caesar's Palace, MGM Grand, Luxor, New York New York and more). We didn't check out many of the restaurants or anything, but we did eat at Mix, which was definitely one of the best meals I've ever had in my life. Our table had a decent view, but the best views of Vegas can be seen from the bar at Mix. After dinner we had a couple drinks and as it started to get dark we watched all the buildings light up, which was a great experience. The only other thing we checked out at THEhotel were the pools. There are several, including a wave pool, and I think I read somewhere that it covers 10 acres. They have sand so it has a beach feel, and I thought overall it was really nice. However, we had to walk pretty far to get to it, and it felt weird for me to walk through the casino and past nice stores in my bathing suit/cover-up to get to the pools. Also, we got there late in the afternoon, and it was really difficult to find 2 chairs that weren't already claimed. On another positive note, though, the front desk was nice enough to issue us 4 extra room keys. You need a key to get into the pool (1 key will admit up to 4 people), and all of the guests for our wedding stayed at Luxor (which has a much smaller pool). So we had plenty of room keys for everyone to use the pool if they wanted to. Another thing people should take into account is that this hotel is very far down the strip (it is practically directly across from the airport). This worked out very well for me because I like quiet, but if you are headed to Vegas because you want to experience the craziness and loudness and be around a bunch of drunk people being wild, then you should probably pick somewhere that is more in the middle of the action like Caesar's or Planet Hollywood. We were able to walk from THEhotel all the way to the Bellagio and Caesar's, but it was a pretty long hike. We probably could have made it the whole way down the strip without a taxi, but we chose not to. Overall, I thought THEhotel was one of the best hotels I've ever stayed at if you take into account decor, price, and service.

That is something I have NEVER heard before at any other hotel - what is the purpose then by booking a Twin Room? You can never know what you will get???

Our phone message light kept blinking even though we had no messages. After three calls to the front desk/operator we gave up. It blinked our entire stay. 2. Housekeeping skipped our room the first day and when we called down, they told us we had to call housekeeping everyday if we wanted our room cleaned. This was false and our room was cleaned everyday for the rest of our stay. Why didn't they just tell us they would send someone up! (Also, I wish they would clean the windows! Hand-prints and smudges are kind of gross.) 3. The television in the bedroom didn't have all the channels and the remote didn't work. However, this was fixed in a timely manner. 4. The pool is a long walk from THEhotel and the signage is not very good directing one there. The best parts were: 1. The pool. We recommend getting a cabana, the service is better and it offered shade which was scarce. Also, it's nice to have tubes for the lazy river. It was too bad the poolside restaurant closed before the end of the day. 2. The spas! I went to the spas both at Mandalay Bay and the Bathhouse at THEhotel. The Bathhouse was my favorite, I had the place to myself most of the time and with a treatment I could use the spa for the entire day. 3. The gym. I know, who wants to workout on vacation, but the gym at THEhotel was so nice I had to mention it. It is worth the extra fee.

I was so amazed! I was instantly impressed the minute I stepped foot into the lobby and into the lifts. I nearly died when I walked through the suite, firstly it was so LARGE and spacious. 1 main bathroom, and a seperate powder room/toilet. An office area with desk, and a lounge room with LCD TV and a lounge of course. Our bedroom has 2 queen sized beds. The bathroom had a seperate bath and a shower. Double vanity, toilet in seperate room, an LCD TV in the bathroom! When getting ready we had MTV on in the shower lol. You could very faintly hear the nightclub music on the top floor at night, but honestly, who is going to bed early in Vegas? It wasnt an issue for us at all. I only heard it when I was lying on the bed waiting for my friend to do her hair before we went out drinking. The strip view was awesome, I could see the Luxor pyramids next door and had a great view of the airport lol. Was kinda fun watching the aircraft take off and land. Mandalay Bay was a great resort as THEhotel is a part of it. Many awesome restaurants around, The Lion King show is fantastic and the beach was pretty great too. Took us forever to get beach chairs on the sand, it was so busy. Only thing id say was a negative was the location, its so far south on the strip, it really is a LOOOONG walk up the strip. We only ever got as far as the Bellagio before getting over the heat and wanting to go back to the room. Stopping at every hotel and casino along the way to escape the heat helped, but became tiring and hard as free drinks kind of got in the way... hahaha.

Dark, rich finishes, 3 TVs, wet bar, 1 1/2 baths, floor to ceiling windows.. Plush all the way. The bathrooms were oversized and luxe and so were the cute toiletries. These are two room suites and although two rooms and large, each room felt a bit narrow. Service - Ups and Downs. Front desk was efficient, but not friendly when checking in, though the agent did allow a 12pm check in, which was nice. Two free drink coupons and explanation of the resort fee, which was a plus. Bartender in the lounge was blah... he poured a crappy drink and barely said hello or thank you. One big kudo was a front desk agent willing to do my printing for me to save me the walk to the business center. Simply emailed it to her and poof, it was done! Pool - You share the pool with MB, so it is a HIKE... Followed other TA tips and cut through the parking garage. Though it saves time, it leaves a lot to be desired in the glamour department. Pools are nice - there are many of them, though good luck finding a chair! The water in the lazy river was murky, but then you could hardly see it with the sea of people in it... Wave pool was neat. Poolside service was nearly non-existent. Didn't like the whole \"stand in line and swipe your room key to get into the pool\" concept. Understanding that this is part of MB, but if THEhotel is co-marketing the pool and considered a 5 star - not exactly 5 star requirements. Food - EXPENSIVE!! No matter where you go, you are going to get screwed. Managed to score a restaurant.com g/c for Shanghai Lilly and had an amazing experience! Kudos to the staff and chef. Bayside buffet was delish and not a bad bargain ($15.99 for breakfast). Considering a take out sandwich at Red White & Blue is $11, plus $3 for a coffee, it is a good way to go for breakfast. Grabbed a quick happy hour bite at RM seafood... blah! Not impressed with the drinks or food. Resort Fee - I have no issue with a resort fee, especially when it includes Wifi, or other value-added services. The biggest issue with the resort fee here is the lack of a true workout facility. The \"cardio room\" is just that - an afterthought of a room tucked on the lowest floor in the dark corner filled (or crammed) with a bunch of equipment. No weights, nothing... blah!

This was our second time staying at TheHotel. A little bit of advice when staying here --- rent a car! TheHotel is at the very end of the Strip which is fine so long as 1) you don't mind walking or 2) are willing to take multiple trams or 3) want to pay for cabs. We've been renting a car on our latest trips (we don't drink much so we don't care at night about driving) and it's worked out great for us, especially when we figured out the backroads to avoid driving down the Strip. Also we love to do other \"non-Vegas\" things like go up to the Red Rocks, visit museums, see the Hover Dam, etc., so the car is great. Check-in: Pretentious and arrogant... The first guy, who we tipped, was assisting us at check-in and told us that at 3pm on Tuesday (when we arrived) they ONLY had a room available on the 7th floor...facing the parking garage. Are you kiddig me? No, I'm not paying to look directly at the parking garage. Then he tried to sell us tickets to the Lion King, and although we said no thank you, he was insistent. Finally I said we disliked musicals to get him to stop. Then he insisted on booking me spa services at TheSpa. I informed him that I had already booked with Spa Mandalay, but I was willing to consider booking at their spa if I could just see the facilitiaties. I was told that \"you can't just 'see' the facilities, you need to book a service there first since it's a European spa and we need to maintain privacy.\" Okay, fine, but maybe if the website were a bit more informative on what the spa atmosphere was like I'd switch... no thanks, I'll stick with Spa Mandalay where everyone is friendly, the spa is inviting and warm and just plainly relaxing. Room: We got up to our 7th floor room and then I turned around and went downstairs where I spoke with, I'm assuming the front desk supervisor or manager (someone higher than the original guy) because she was able to put into a room on the floor right below their villas/super-deluxe rooms. GORGEOUS view and it was during the time all the major cities turn out the lights for an hour, so we got to watch that from our room (turning off and then on). AMAZING! Room was fantastic as always. Clean, one and half bathrooms, living room, and separate bedroom. I love the separate bedroom since you can't get hallway noise from it. On the hallway side of the bedroom is the beautiful full-bath with large soaking tub and large shower and separate toliet. On the other side is the wall of the windows. Then you have the doorway to the living room, so you're completely secluded from hallway noise. I was surprised to find out they have adjoining rooms! We walked into the second room (the upgraded one) and we had a doorway in the living room to the adjoining room (which was locked of course). Only on one night did we briefly hear a group of guys either watching an action flick or playing an action video game REALLY loudly... No big deal, we came back later that night and it was fine. Watch out for... the prostitutes hanging out by the elevator banks late at night. Couldn't believe it! It was SOOO blantaly obvious they were prostitutes because we'd come back and forth within a two-hour time frame and the same woman was standing there. I finally called security and they said they'd take care of it. I understand it's Vegas and all, but really by the elevator banks in this upscale place? Don't like it at all... made it all feel a bit trashy then. It happened two nights in a row, and it happened exactly like that on our last stay here. Overall, TheHotel is an upscale place and we got our money's worth. I can't stand the arrogance that's displayed by the staff, and the prostitutes hanging out by the lobby thing its a bit much for me, so I think we'll start looking for a new place in the future. Still, if you want space and lots of bathrooms, this is the place to be!", "Date": "August 4, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Grand Rapids, Minnesota", "Title": "\u201cNot quite 5 stars, but close!\u201d", "Author": "midnitebreeze", "ReviewID": "UR73807616", "Content": "This was my third, and my husband's second trip to Vegas. We did a two part trip staying 3 nights downtown and 2 on the strip. We wanted to spluge a little at a 4-5 star stip hotel for the second part of our stay and came across a very good deal at THEhotel...a V suite for $112/night! For those of you unfamiliar with the rooms at THEhotel, the V suite is a corner suite which is a bit larger and a bit upgraded from their standard THEsuite. We arrived before check in time and were able to see an agent right away, which was great. They said our 17th floor V-suite with a strip view was ready. Great! When we got to the room, however, we discovered it was not the smoking preference we had requested. She told us they had another strip view room available, 30th floor, but it was a standard suite. We decided the slightly smaller square footage was worth having our smoking prefernce as well as a better view and without having to wait until check in time. I asked if we would be discounted for getting the \"downgraded\" suite upon check out and she said yes. They sent someone up with a new key right away and we were in business. Our view from the 30th floor was incredible! I could have sat there for hours just looking at all the lights. Our suite was just as advertised on their webiste...HUGE soaking tub, seperate shower, two sinks and TV in the main bathroom. Seperate half bath in the entry way and good sized living and bed rooms done in very subdued and modern decor. Compared to the V-suite, our living room was a little narrower, the bedroom only had one set of floor to ceiling windows as opposed to two, and there was a \"regular\" TV in the bedroom instead of a plasma. I was also a bit disappointed that there were no robes in the regular suite as there was (one?) in the V-suite. They did provide slippers, though. Nice high-end toilitries including lotion (both bathrooms), facial and body soap, shampoo, conditioner and bath crystals. Oddly, housekeeping was a bit chintzy on the towels, etc....i.e., only two washcloths provided for two people, which meant I had to shower with the same washcloth I used to wash my face the night before. Not a huge deal, but not what I expected for a 4.5-5 star hotel. On the other hand, our room was spotless both nights. One thing I really loved about THEhotel was the serene feeling of the public spaces. The lobby is quiet and classy, definitely a break from the chaos of the rest of Vegas. We had our free welcome drink in the lounge (yes, that's the name) and it was just so nice and peacful. We also enjoyed breakfast at the cafe (yep, \"the\" everything here), again, a relaxing experience. (Tip: the cafe is on restaruant.com. We got a $25 certificate for $2 or $3 dollars during one of their 80% of promotions....so our high end breakfast only cost us around $25, with tip, instead of $50! Actually, there are quite a few Mandalay restaurants on that site, so if you plan on eating around there, it's definitely worth checking out.) My only complaint about the lobby is the lack of elevators. I know this is not something that can be easily fixed, but it seems they should have more than 4 elevators per elevator bank for a hotel this size? (one bank serves the lower floors and another the higher ones.) More than once we actually had to wait in line for an elevator in the lobby. Checkout was pretty painless (virtually no wait), but we had to mention the discount for not getting the suite we had originally booked and paid for. They just waived our resort fee ($15/day, which DOES include free in-room WiFi), so we thought that was fair enough. While we were there, we did go to the famous Mandalay pool complex. It was neat, but quite crowded and LOTS of kids. I'm not necessarily one of the \"don't bring kids to Vegas\" types of people...but it did get annoying at times...the lazy river was more an exercise in avoiding getting splashed and hit by wayward rugrats in inner tubes than a relaxing float. I also thought it was a bit odd that the wave pool didn't generate more than one wave at a time? It was like one wave every few minutes rather than a series of waves as I've experienced at water parks. Tip: (that I learned here on TA)...cutting through the parking garage to the pool will save you a long walk through the casino. Basically you go out through the main THEhotel doors into the garage and over to the Mandaly entrance. This will put you by the restaurants. Follow the signs to the convention center and take the escalator down. At the bottom of the escalator you can go right outside into the pool area. Also, if you haven't seen the Lion King show, I highly recommend it! The showroom is right outside the casino entrance to THEhotel, so you don't have to walk far at all :) Hubby and I both loved it. Also, if you're going to Vegas before the end of August, use the promo code ZOO40 on ticketmaster to get 40% off! We got great seats in the front and center section (section B). Overall, our stay was very, very good...just a tad short of perfect. For the price though (less than $100/night!) I would definitely stay again.", "Date": "August 4, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Glasgow, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful Hotel.

First thing of note is the ease of getting into this hotel. There is a separate parking garage for The Hotel that has valet service (no charge, just tips) and allows easy access to the lobby. The lobby is hip and modern and has a relaxing feel (and smell). A small caf\u00e9 and bar adorn the lobby and the check-in was quick and simple (unlike a previous experience at the Mandalay Bay main property). The rooms are all suites (not large studios but separate bedroom suites). The d\u00e9cor follows the feel of the lobby with 1 \u00bd bathrooms, TVs in the living room, bedroom & bathroom, a couch and work area in the living room and plenty of space for clothes. Very nice all around. Other than the caf\u00e9 and bar, there is Mix lounge and restaurant on top of The Hotel with stunning views of the strip. For the bulk of the nightlife and dining, you can take the short walk to the connected Mandalay Bay and Mandalay Place. We had some great small plates at Aureole but there are tons of choices in the complex. You can also take a walk (or tram) to the also connected Luxor and Excalibur for more dining. We enjoyed Tender, Luxor\u2019s steakhouse for a nice dinner (although I enjoyed my tuna more than my wife enjoyed her prawns). The kids liked the food court over in Excalibur and the frozen yogurt shop in Mandalay Place. Nightlife is also abundant. We loved Minus 5 in Mandalay Place, an ice bar that is kept at 23 degrees F (minus 5 degrees C). The Foundation Room is real nice and has spectacular views of the strip from atop MB. Gaming at Mizuya Lounge and watching a nearby band was fun. The pool complex is like a mini-water park with a wave pool, lazy river and regular pools. In the summer, get there early to get a chair in the very little shade that is available. NOTE: a fairly good walk from The Hotel to the pool.

It was his first time at this property and my second time. It's been a few years since my stay and I'm sorry to say I do not think many capital improvements have been made recently. I want to love this hotel, based on my first experience, but I'm afraid I'm a bit deflated, especially when I made my pro vs. con list. First, to start with the positives: 1) The rooms are all suites, with powder rooms. We had a V Suite, and we loved having two views from the corner. While a full Strip view would have been preferred (I was told it was not available), we had a good view of the pool facilities and some of the south end of the Strip. 2) The bathroom is spacious with double sinks, a WC, and a deep tub. 3) The pool area is fun if quite crowded. We splurged for Moorea on Saturday to get away from children and met some great people. 4) We got a great deal via text from Mandalay Bay. It was a great daily rate over the holiday weekend, however not a huge savings over the Wynn or even a late breaking 4Seasons package (hindsight...) 5) Housekeeping cleaned the room in the morning so by lunch it was in good shape (but more down below). 6) The food around Mandalay Bay is pretty decent. The not-so-good: 1) The duvet had stains. The decorative pillows had stains. Time to recycle the bedding - preferably ones without Vegas all over them. DISGUSTING. 2) The seal in the shower was hanging down. Certainly housekeeping has noticed this, but it seems nothing has been done. 3) Dust was everywhere; very noticeable around the bar area. The cleaning turns is lightening quick, but not complete. 4) The spring on one side of the bed was busted. I called at 9:30 am Saturday to report it. I did not hear back until 6:30 pm as we were eating dinner asking if we wanted to change suites. We were in no mood to pack up and move on Saturday night. Why does this take 9 hours? 5) There was something on the wall of the WC that we had to clean. I do not want to know what that was or why housekeeping didn't notice it when the turned the room. 6) The furniture is nicked, scratched, and looks like something in a dorm room. 7) TV stations are horrible. There are so many hotel choices in Vegas that I would suggest somewhere else. You can find great rates at the 4 Seasons website, and while the rooms are smaller (except suites) and it's a bit more expensive, it's in another league. They Wynn properties are great and the Palazzo much more refined. I'm pulling for THEhotel, but until there is a returned focus to cleanliness, service, and new finishes, I can not recommend this property.", "Date": "July 6, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hickory, North Carolina", "Title": "\u201cGreat Vacation\u201d", "Author": "ckgirl1967", "ReviewID": "UR69956519", "Content": "We stayed from June 16-21 and had a great time.

Maybe I am a bit too spoiled...maybe I expect too much. I travel extensively but have somehow skipped Las Vegas and was really expecting something different. So, I was a bit disappointed in The Hotel. The Hotel is a nice property but is definitely not in the 5 star category; a 3.5 at best. The rooms are spacious and appear grand but the cleanliness leaves much to be desired. I get the impression that at one time The Hotel established itself as a cut above but has lowered its standard in order to survive the economic downturn. Now, I understand that they turn over the rooms quickly so there is not much time but the room was not inexpensive--not outrageously expensive but for the price I expect a higher level of cleanliness. The bathroom had hair on the floor (not ours) and the drain in the shower looked like it had not been cleaned in ages as you could see the build-up of hair in the drain plus lots of mold/soap scum on the shower. The amenities in the bath were meager; no robes--that surprised me. Very little in the way of shampoo/lotion etc.. the bare minimum. Sparse towels in terms of number and luxury. We had V suite which was spacious enough and had a good layout. BUT-- the upholstered headboard had stains which I don't want to speculate about --you can only imagine. The room was dusty and just looked like it needed a good deep cleaning. As for the rest of The Hotel, I have to admit I was a bit put off by the overall behavior of many of the guests. Again, perhaps I was expecting too much from Vegas. I was rather shocked to see so many extremely intoxicated people, drinks in hand and behaving badly (foul language etc...) roaming through the lobby and the hotel. Again, it is not what I expected. The pool area was attractive--but PACKED. On the positive side, the Concierge was very helpful in securing tickets and reservations for us. I appreciated that. Also, the food in Aureole was very good and the service top-notch. I really believe the property has incredible potential if they would put more emphasis on cleanliness but maybe they don't have to do that--maybe I should find another property that fits my demands. Next time I would choose the Mandarin Oriental a little quieter crowd etc...Maybe I am just getting too picky in my old age.", "Date": "June 26, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego, California", "Title": "\u201c2nd visit in 30 days, as good as the first\u201d", "Author": "nevdestine", "ReviewID": "UR68676570", "Content": "THEhotel is now our favorite place to stay.

It's a very modern and elegant hotel, I l-o-v-e-d the installations. Our room was really big and confortable. The bathroom was spacious and the amenities were just great. Make sure you got a map of the hotel, it's really big (considering it's inside Mandalay Bay) and you can got lost. LOCATION: The Hotel is a little bit far from the Strip. Nevertheless there are so many ways to go though the hotels, that it wasn't a problem for us. PRICE: I can't say it was a bargain because it wasn't, but I think we paid fair for a AAA category hotel.

We had a big group. here's some observations. 1. Room is nice because they are all suites so you have a separate area from the main bedroom, which is nice. However, these are not huge rooms. 1 1/2 bathrooms which is always a plus with kids. The coach does not pull out to a bed, however, you can ask for extra linens and make the coach into a makeshift bed if needed. 2. The rooms at The Hotel are not extremely clean. They are clean enough, but not super clean. My husband looked in a panel of the TV and it was so dusty, obviously never cleaned. The tile in the bathroom was also dirty. Just wear your socks. 3. The Pool. this is the main reason you stay at MB or The Hotel, right? Anyhow,they have added a whole new section of \"paid chairs\" so if you want to pay for a chair to sit on, then you are happy. If not, that means a whole lot less lounge chairs for our use! Here's the deal, if you want to pay for a chair, get to the pool at 8am to get a paid chair and to pick which one you want. If you DO NOT want to pay for a chair and cannot find one. Seek out a pool attendant, they will find you some lounge chairs for a TIP. Show the cash and you are in business. As for Cabana's, reserve WAY in advance if you want one. The day of the cabana prices go up depending on availability. This past weekend they started at $925, LAME! Other than too many people being at the pool all the time, the pool is fun and anyone can enjoy this pool/wavepool if you know how to get around what's going on. 4. Where to eat/drink. There are several Starbucks on the resort property so that is good since they do not provide a coffee maker. The Cafe in the lobby area is really good but also really expensive. The Coffee bar has sandwiches, salads all around $10 each, they are in togo containers which makes it convenient to take to the pool or eat in room. Border Grill was excellent for food, they have coupons on restaurant.com Raffles is a coffee shop, the food is fine. They also have coupons on restaurant.com There were several happy hour specials going on while we were there, inquire upon arrival and get the happy hour booklet. House of Blues had 2-4-1 drinks and food items. As I think of other things, I will add them. Please feel free to ask any questions. 5. Free nightlife in hotel Rumjungle is a free club on the main level. they have top 40 dance music. It's fun if you go with a group. Mixx is on the top floor of The Hotel, it's gorgeous, what an awesome view. It's free to get into. It's a beautiful lounge, bar. The Foundation Room is on top of Mandalay Bay.

As other people had mentioned, no in-room coffee... only expensive mini-bar food. One of our pillow shams had a stain which we left a note for housekeeping the next day and they replaced. Nice-quality TV's and TV in bathroom. Smaller than expected living room area, but it had a door to separate it from the bedroom. The sofa is NOT a sofa-sleeper, btw. After sharing a room with the kids the first night, we had already booked a second king-room for the remaining two nights. The first night we had to pay holiday rates ($$$) for the one room, but the room price was significantly cheaper Monday and Tuesday. We recommend that people sign up for the MGM Player's club to receive notice of extreme discounts (we got our weekday rooms for $96 each and that included our resort fees.)

We purchase our own inner-tubes at a Wal-Mart which the guy at the Tube rental desk happily filled for us. We had some beers by the pool which were $7 each plus tip. We ate the buffet breakfast one morning ($25 per person), not worth it. The second day, we walked to the food court at Excaliber where we ate McD's, Starbucks, and Krispy Kremes. We ate some sushi one night in the casino, and it was very good. Also, we ate at the Mexican restaurant that was near the pool and that was very good, too (nice outdoor seating on a balcony level overlooking the pool area.) Otherwise, we ate elsewhere. When we ventured to The Venetian for a show, we drove. Since parking is free, it was the cheapest was to go. We were able to use the side streets that run parallel to the Strip to avoid traffic.

Also, you can walk from THEhotel/Mandalay Bay through Luxor to Excalibur without going outside. The restaurant and bar selection of THEhotel and Manadaly Bay is large enough that you could eat there for a week and try something new. Food and servoce were very good and price was what you would expect in Vegas. I researched this website and saw a lot of negative comments prior to booking my trip at THEhotel. I don't know what the negative people are thinking, but after a week in Vegas, THEhotel was by far and away the best and most economical place to stay for a family. It was our first trip to Vegas as a family and I hope to be able to do it again next year. I recommend it highly to anyone who likes to stay at a fun place.", "Date": "June 3, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cLarge, Very comfortable king suite\u201d", "Author": "lakohls", "ReviewID": "UR66375344", "Content": "Stayed for 3 nights on a recent business trip.

THE Hotel does not have its own pool, so you have to walk a mile to use the pools for Mandalay Bay, that in of itself is reason enough to stay at The Four Seasons. To avoid having to use the pools at Mandalay Bay and the gaggle of kids, we decided to pay to use the Moorea Beach Club. One would think that paying a premium for an adult pool would afford us some peace and quiet to enjoy our day in the sun. That was not the case. When we arrived to the pool at noon the music was already booming, and not in a good way, rather like the annoying people who drive by with the bass and volume so loud it makes your car vibrate. To top that off they were playing \"Gangster Rap\". I have no problem with rap music but \"Gangster Rap\" is whole another ball of wax. After about an hour of \"[--], [--], and Ho's suck my [--], I had enough and went to ask for the music to be changed. When nothing happened I went back to the front with another guest asking for the manager of the pool. He was aggressive and argumentative about the music and how the Moorea Beach Club was attempting to provide a \"club like\" environment for its guests. That's a legitimate argument, however, at noon on a Tuesday when the average person at the pool is over the age of 40 and half of them being women, the music was offensive and over-powering for those of us who wanted to relax by the pool. For an establishment that tries to pride itself in catering to a \"higher\" class of clientele neither the service nor the atmosphere lends itself to either. I recommend staying at The Four Seasons or the newly opened Mandarine Oriental. For about the same amount of money you will save yourself alot of headache and a much more enjoyable stay.", "Date": "June 2, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "San diego", "Title": "\u201celegant suites\u201d", "Author": "Miker422", "ReviewID": "UR65831482", "Content": "Here as part of a convention and decided to stay at a different hotel then my usual haunts which are Venetian, Ceasars.

PLEASE never go in the summer if you are heat sensitive. Going in May was a delight...the weather was wonderful. I will be comparing this hotel with The Venetian as that is where I stayed last July. I expected the cab ride from the airport to TheHotel to be cheaper then when I stayed at The Venetian because of how close it is to the airport. Well, it still cost about $15.00. Be prepared to pay approx $20.00 every time you take a cab anywhere on the strip. I'm just warning those who are not used to riding in cabs or how fast a fare can add up. Be prepared and don't let the shock factor ruin your mood! When the cab pulls into a parking garage and up to TheHotel don't be alarmed and think you are being dropped off in some back Vegas alley. It is strange that you have to travel into a parking garage to get to the front of TheHotel but I noticed several hotels in Vegas have shady looking entrances (Imperial Palace). The staff are VERY friendly and TheHotel was very classy. It is easy to find the registration desk and you don't have to maneuver through a casino to find it. Very quiet in the lobby if that is what you are looking for. If you want the excitement of hearing the casino when you get to your hotel go with most of the other hotels. The front desk upgraded me to a regular room with a view. He said usually it is a forty dollar upgrade. I said \"yep, ok\" not getting too excited. WELL...the room was on the 36th floor and had an awesome view of the strip. I could lay in bed and just gaze at the Luxor and its lights and the strip. If a view is important to you please pay the $40.00! When you walk into the room there is a half bath and then the living area with flat screen tv, couch and desk. You walk through a door and into a beautiful bedroom and a bathroom with a seperate toliet, large soaking tub (not jetted) and a shower. The door seperating the rooms is wonderful if you are with people that like to watch tv late and you just want to hit the bed. BIG COMPLAINT...the walls are paper thin!!!! I could hear babies crying, music, chit chat and tv from the rooms next door. If you have trouble falling asleep and staying asleep DO NOT stay at this hotel!!! If someone tells you any different there were lucky or they fall asleep and stay asleep easily. At The Veneitian I had no trouble with noise. Beds at both hotels are very comfortable. Also, there was no security keeping non-guests off the elevators and in the hallways to the guest rooms. I saw several people wandering around to just see what the guest floors were like. At The Venitian there is security at the elevators that would not even let you on the elevator to the guest floors without showing a room key. I took joy rides on the elevators at Luxor and wandered around the guest floors (just FYI - in case security is important to you). I liked the regular rooms at The Venetian better because the bedroom and living room was connected - one big open space - the living room was sunken and had a huge L shaped coach. I was not with anyone that wanted to stay up late watching tv that time so a seperate closed off living area was not important to me. If you are with a large group and would like to have drinks together or just chit chat the L shaped couch at The Venetian is hard to beat. WARNING...TheHotel now has a $15.00 resort fee which they charge everyone (unless, like me, you book the room before it when in effect). The fee covers a free USA Today, in-room wireless interent, cardio room access, two free bottled waters, local and 800 number calls and outgoing faxes and boarding passes. WARNING...do NOT even touch the candy, waters and other items sitting in a box like thing in the living area. The items are on a sensor and if you even move them you will be charged. Same goes for the mini-fridge. Luckily, they give you a key you have to use to open the mini-fridge which is easy to hide from kids/drunk friends but the items just sitting out in the box is within reach. You WILL be charged for just moving them (this is the same at The Venetian). The shower in the bath was showing its age (already???) but The Venetian bath rooms were wonderful. I liked the lay out and quietness of The Venetian but it is really personal preference. Don't worry, the walk from TheHotel to The Mandalay Bay casino/beach/restuarants is really not that long of a walk compared to other hotels. The beach and pools were impressive but I'm not much of a pool goer. The little kids looked like they were having fun. Cabanas were crammed together and were SO close to the regular beach goers....did not look worth the money. There is a tram that takes you from Mandalay Bay to Excalibar with a stop at Luxor if you want. Also..there is now a tram that takes you from Monte Carlo to Belligioand Aria.

Reception/Check-in The boutique feel hits you the second you walk in. No manic casino to walk through, just calm chic. They pump a nice smell throughout the lobby too. I couldn't quite make it out but it was nice all the same! We had to wait a while to get checked in and was unfortunate to be seen by a trainee. No bother though as she checked us in without any issues. We were offered assistance with our bags but we respecfully declined... The H-Suite (60th Floor) The suite is very big, with it's own wet bar, lounge/dining area, small business desk with fax machine, etc., a secondary lounge just before the large bedroom, a large bathroom with massive jacuzzi tub and shower/steam room. There is also a seperate toilet just off the main lounge area so no queues whilst entertaining! In total, there are three 42\" TV's plus a smaller one in the bathroom. The rack housing the rest of the AV equipment was very impressive; two amps, two DVD players, a radio receiver and a VHS player. All of this could be controlled by wall mounted controllers in every room. We showed a slideshow on every screen during our party and used the in-ceiling speakers for our party music. The TV channels offered were actually quite poor and inferior to the main hotel at Mandalay Bay....mainly because THEhotel don't provide HD channels, whereas Mandalay Bay does. No bother though as we weren't interested in watching TV. As well as the AV controllers, other controllers for aircon and curtains were also available in every room. Room Service The day we arrived, we requested for an additional fridge to be delivered to our bar area (as we were hosting a party) and this was delivered within 30 minutes. We only ordered food once and, again, this was for our party. Because we were ordering food for 12 people, we gave them a bit of time and ordered it at 4:30pm and asked for it to be delivered at 6:00pm. It was delivered at 6:05pm. My only (small) criticism was that some of the food wasn't particularly hot.....but no doubt this was due to the amount of food we ordered and the time taken to prepare it all. When the food was delivered, they laid a table cloth on the dining table and presented the food in a professional manner. The food itself was nice, nothing too special.....steak sandwiches, wagyu burgers, club sandwiches, tuna baguettes, vegetable paninis, french fries, potato salads, etc. THEbeach area and other pools To get a free lounger, you need to get there quite early! By 10:00am, most of them are taken. You can pay a fee to get a slightly better one. You can also pay considerably more (upto $500 per day!) for a beach bungalow (with aircon, TV's, fridges!). The beach itself is nice and the simulated waves coming from \"the sea\" were very realistic. We paid $70 ($50 for men, $20 for women) to go to the Moorea Beach Club. This area had more pools, loungers, day beds, etc.....plus a DJ and a bar. It was full of artificially enhanced people (think silicon and 'roids!). It had more of an exclusive feel to it and if you want to party during the day, it's definitely worth a visit. Facilities We didn't use many of the facilities, but they all looked very nice. We did go to the Mix Lounge on the top floor though. From there, the view of the strip has to be one of THEbest in Las Vegas.

The floor to ceiling windows are great especially if you are on a higher floor facing west toward the mountains. The only major drawback is the very long walk to the pool area. The other drawback to some might just be what is so attractive to me about this property. The ambiance is sedate - meaning that it is dark but not gloomy. The atmosphere of calm is enhanced by the darker tones. I find most Vegas hotels are overly bright and cheerful with color clashing everywhere. This is not THEhotel. The tones are cool and (again) sedate and quiet; peaceful. However, the casino excitement and numerous eateries are steps away.

While the pool could be a decent walk, the restaurants and casino are a very short distance from THE Hotel. Although I was originally considering staying at The Signature at MGM, I was so glad I chose THE Hotel after walking over to The Signature suite. The MGM set up is MUCH more spread out than Manadalay. Put it this way, you have to go down at least three moving sidewalks just to get to building one of The Signature....not including the long walk from the casino through the shopping mall and restaurant area. Checking out Mix nightclub is a must. Incredible views and an overall cool atmosphere. Lastly, I really enjoyed the \"bottom of the strip\" location of Mandalay Bay in general.

That in itself was quite something. But, we're talking about THE hotel. We got into our room and were impressed by the size of it. It was real quite. Although, ten minutes after we arrived, a maintenance guy shows up to tell us that our bathroom sink is leaking into the downstairs room. Ok..no problem, he fixes it and then we decide to go out and explore Mandalay Bay. We had our dinner at the buffet there and I can tell you it's the first buffet where I had to wait to be seated. The food was okay though. Nothing terrific about it though. The servers there were attentive; deserving of their tip. We then played some slots and went to bed. It was a long day. It was real nice to look out our window and have a great view of the Luxor to our left and the mountains in front of us (the airport, too). I couldn't go to sleep right away. Stayed up and watched tv in the living area while my husband went to sleep in the bedroom. We were on the 26th floor and there is a restaurant/club up on the 64th floor. I could hear the people and the music as if they were outside my window; that's how loud they were. I was tired enough, though, that I was able to go to sleep in spite of that. The next morning we discovered our shower made this real loud whistling like sound. Someone came and fixed it while we were gone for the day and we were told that it's usually not that loud, but they had a bigger crowd than usual up in the club which could explain the noise level. I didn't hear that level of noise again during our stay. (Sat to Thurs). Monday morning we left early to go on a South Rim Grand Canyon tour. Loved it..although it was long, it was well worth it. The canyon is a beautiful example of nature at it's finest. We did get back later..around 9 p.m. to discover that our room key cards didn't work. Had to wait 20 mins in the hallway for the maintenance guy to come up to watch him break into our room with crow bars. Turns out that the batteries to the lock were dead. Not something we needed to deal with at the end of a very long day. We purchased Las Vegas Power Passes and the writing as to where we had to pick them up was not clear; ended up spending a couple of hours trying to find out where it was that we had to pick them up in. It's at the Forum Shops in Ceasar's Palace at the Planet Hollywood retail shop next to the restaurant. I don't think those are worth the money unless you are able to really travel to all the attractions. Just be aware, there is tons and tons of walking to be done unless you have your own car. You have to walk through every casino for one reason or another to get wherever you need to go. To get to the monorail from THEhotel, we had to walk through Mandalay Bay to the tram that goes to The Excalibur then we had to cross the street to the MGM Grand and had to walk at least a mile if not more to get to the monorail. And when you want to come back that way, it's the same, having to walk through some casino for a mile or more to get to the monorail. We saw The Blue Man Group, The Tournament of the Kings and Defending the Caveman. All really good shows. We also caught a small blues band at the House of Blues in Mandalay Bay on Tuesday night that was real good. All in all, the hotel room, while very, very nice and the hotel employees were very helpful, the casinos and the shows and the Grand Canyon stick out in my mind. If you want to know what you'll spend most of your money on (if you aren't a huge gambler like myself) it's the food. Unless you live in places like McDonalds, you'll find most food bills will be at least $30 for two people. Oh, I do advise not buying drinks at THE hotels lounge. For two drinks; a gin and tonic and a fuzzy navel...$23!! geesh. Nothing is cheap in that hotel except when you need to print out your security documents for your airline; that is free in their business office. Oh, that reminds me. we don't use a credit card. We used our banks debit card that has the MC logo on it; allowing us to use it anywhere. Anyway, we wanted to purchase the internet from them and they said b/c the card was a debit card and not a credit card they would charge us $100 a day for the 'incidental' expense and would, at the end of our stay, then reimburse us the difference once we checked out. We were lucky that my husband had his works wireless usb or we would have been without internet and unable to keep in communication with out kids. That's about it folks.

Plenty of storage space for shopping and suitcase items. I loved their bathrobes and slippers. The slippers were furry and exquisite! Bathroom had a separate shower and tub. 2 sinks in the master bathroom and then another half piece bathroom outside in entryway to the suite - wonderful idea! I liked the formalized desk area and the amount of space in the living room area. Plenty of space to entertain a couple of friends before going out for the night or after dinner one of our other nights. Someone managed to spot the In-n-Out burger from our window and we did go there for a quick bite to eat sometime after midnight. Good times. We had a car - so it was extremely convenient for us to be at the THEhotel. I can understand that if you don't have a car it can be a pain to get to/from to the hotel. Casino was okay for our needs. Had a large sports betting area and lots of table games/slot machines that we wanted to play. It's also connected to a mall so plenty of shopping could be done... One thing to note is that there was an upside down M&M Peanuts can in our room which was empty on arrival. We advised them of that and we weren't charged for it - but it reminded me to always check for those kinds of things in the room. There were also weird syrupy stains near the desk area and the remote felt dirty. I guess all the dark furniture/carpeting hides most of this but I figured at the price I'm paying it would've been a little more immaculate. I did, however, find THEhotel stickers on my neatly folded bathroom tissue and THEwhatever all over the room's items. I think there was THEnotepad. It may annoy some but I found it endearing. We ended up spending the resort credit offer on some food at the hotel and the hotel's convenience store. Check-in/check-out was a breeze. 5-10 minute wait but the reception staff were a pleasure to deal with. This isn't the hotel's fault but we got a taxi downstairs to go to the Bellagio one night (just to drink and have fun) and the driver decided to give us guff when we responded to his question of: \"Which way do you want me to go?\" and I responded: \"The shortest and cheapest way.\" He then proceeded to complain about the 40 minute wait he had sitting alone in the taxi rank at the hotel. I figured it's because this property is further away that guests may usually be looking for longer rides to other locations and that the Bellagio was too short of a fare to make up for his wait.

This hotel is at the far south end of the Strip so everything is pretty far away.

The pools at the other hotels seem just as crowded, so who cares about the pool next time. Location is now more important.

The cab rides will eat away at your travel budget, so be smart about it and use the tram to Excalibur. 4.2 miles walking from Mandalay Bay to the Stratosphere doesn't sound like an awful lot, but it's a bit of a time waster to be perfectly honest.

Again we had a V Suite, this time on the 5th floor. Despite being so close to the traffic, we never heard a sound and slept like the dead. The suite bedroom and sitting room are not huge but easily large enough for 2 people. The bathroom is enormous, and the tub is big enough and deep enough to drown in. I love the exclusive toiletries which I always think smell like a margerita, citrusy and a little alcoholic. The location is a little off the beaten track, being the southernmost hotel on the Strip, but I think that contributes to the calm and quiet. After experiencing the excesses of some of the other hotels and casinos, it can be a relief to return to THEHotel at the end of the night. Even if it did take us around an hour to walk back from the Bellagio at around 1 am on New Year's Day with all the roads closed to traffic. The only sour spot was the manicure I got at the spa before a dinner out. It was ridiculously expensive and totally perfunctory. She could barely be bothered to slap a bit of hand cream on before applying the polish.

To begin with, the rooms are beautiful. My room (36901) was a two-room suite. It had a nice living room with a huge flat screen TV, and an exceptionally comfortable couch. There was a nice desk to work from and and the entire room reminded me more of a well-appointed apartment or condo...not a hotel. The bedroom was beautiful and the bathroom (there are two) was huge. The master bath included a TV as well...just in case you didn't want to miss your show. Ckeckin-in was exceptionally fast (something you won't find at the larger casino properties) and the property is joined with the main Mandalay Bay property so all of the resort facilities are available to you within a few steps. The ONLY drawback I can see to this property is the location. Mandalay Bay is at the far end of the strip. I personally prefer to be closer to the center because of the traffic, the cab ride will kill you. But if you have your own car, this is a non-issue. All in all, I would give this a five star rating.

Got two nights for 189$ with a hundred dollar resort credit. What a steal this was. THE Hotel is a very chic upscale property. Property looks just like the advertisements and all the pics everyone has posted. No need to say mcuh more on the rooms, very nice, exactly as the pictures, comfy bed, nice robes, nice slipper, huge bathroom, awesome soaking tub. Did use room service one night, very nice as well. Delivered promptly and served warm. Waiter set up a table very nice for us. Everyone in the hotel was really warm, friendly and helpful. No complaints. Would stay here again only if the price was fantastic - prefer to be mid strip. My other new Vegas comments: Boy City Center is ugly. In my opinion it just does not fit in. The one tower that is built to be crooked on purpose drives me insane. Pink's Hotdog Stand (new for us this time around..Planet Hollywood) was fabulous. I can't wait to go back and try it again.

THEhotel was located next to the actual Mandalay Bay hotel, but shares the same resort and facilities. THEhotel was basically the upscaled and modern version of Mandalay Bay. There are actually two places you can check in. When we first came in from the parking lot, one of the employees accidentally directed us to the Mandalay Bay check in counter. They still checked us in to our room. The check in time was 3PM and we came just around then. We then walked to the actual lobby of THEhotel. When being taken to the other side, THEhotel was actually totally different compared to Mandalay Bay. The hallway was divided in which the other side was dark, but stylish while the Mandalay Bay side was elegant and tropical. THEhotel was not a typical boutique, but it was a large and spacious one with many employees ready to help. The room was spacious. Our room was on the 4th floor. However when we got there, the room was not ready yet as it was still being serviced. She kindly let us go in and we trusted her to not take our stuff when we left our things there. We came back a while later and found the whole room clean and our stuff in the same condition we left them in. The room had a living room, two bathrooms (one without a shower or bathtub), and a bedroom. When it was time to checkout, the process was quick. You can checkout using the TV in your room or drop off some paperwork at the Express Checkout box. Both options were great, but we used the TV option. The facilities were pretty nice. When we were there, Mandalay Beach was not opened but they left a pool open with two hot tubs. The pool was pretty nice and the spas too. There were also a number of restaurants like Fleur de Lys, miX and much more. There was also a tram connecting to the Luxor and Excalibur which were next door. The Bathhouse was pretty nice too, but it wasn't free. It costs $30 a day and theres a fitness room and sauna. Pretty good deal. The internet was not free though. In the end, THEhotel at Mandalay Bay was a great hotel. Besides the bad things like no free internet and fitness room, it was a great stay.

A bunch of us cousin's decided to take our wives to Vegas as a couples trip, 4 couples in total, 2 couples left Toronto and another 2 left from Edmonton. The first issue was our connecting flight out of Chicago was delayed by about 2 hours, no big deal. So we arrived in vegas around 6pm. When we finally got to the hotel, my room was not ready (this is at 6.30pm and I was told I would have to wait 2 hours to have my room ready), and my cousins room apparently got changed from a KING to 2 queens (even though we all booked KINGS). And David the front desk rep was not helpful at all. He had to go ask his manager about every little thing, if we could be upgraded, comp'd anything, we even asked for free wifi and they said no to everything. We also wanted to have all of our rooms close by (at least on the same floor, and when we called they said they were all confirmed on the same floor). This too wasnt the case, we were all on different floors and when we asked to get the same floor they told us it wasnt possible. The only redeaming factor was the fact the rooms were very nice, as a standard suite it was beautiful. I am heading back to Vegas at the end of March and will not be staying at this hotel. Maybe if you are not in a group you'd have better luck with their service. Anyways, thought i'd share my experiance. PS.

There's a tv in the room which wasn't a flat screen but it worked. The only downside to this hotel is that I found the entrance and lift area quite dark but it was very clean. The grounds of the hotel (Mandalay Bay) are really nice to take photos there are waterfalls, lovely statues and plant areas. We found the casino a little quiet so we went to the Luxor which is next door. There is a free tram which goes from the Mandalay bay to Excalibur which saves you a 10-15mins walk depending how tired you are. From the hotel it takes around 25mins to walk to Planet Hollywood Casino. There are foot bridges which you use to cross roads instead of waiting for traffic lights to change. The Bay side buffet in Mandalay Bay was really nice for breakfast you'll be spoilt for choice. Las Vegas premium outlet is a must we found lots of bargains. We got a taxi there from Paris it cost $20 with the tip. Fashion Mall and Miracle Mile have good shops too. We went to the shops in Caesers forum and Bellagio which are all expensive designers but it was nice to see. We watched Matsuri which is a Japanese circus style show.

And it's also quite nice that in a morning you don't have to go through a casino to get out of the hotel as you do with most of the others.

Both my boyfriend and I work for 4 diamond hotels, and know that if we had this many challenges with the hotel management would have been in touch by now to see if the issues could be resolved and to ensure that we are a happy guest who will return. **No available king size beds upon check-in at about 3:30 pm on December 29th, can definitely understand that our request is never guaranteed but it was disappointing to not have one available. The Front Desk Agent then advised us that we could take the double queen available at that moment or wait for a few hours and a King might come available but there was no guarantee about that either. An offer to have drinks in the lounge while we waited for the next one could have been provided, which is what we typically do when the room requested is not ready. **The double queen room that we were checked into was dirty \u2013 crumbs on the couch and clothing tags and stickers all over the bedroom floor, which of course then made us question the cleanliness of the rest of the room. Decided to return to the front desk to let them know and after a few minutes a room change was offered as well as the assistance of the bellman. With only one bag each however, the offer to have the bellmen assist was declined. The unfortunate thing was that we had unpacked all of our belongings already and had all of our clothes hung up and put away into drawers, so even though we were the ones that mentioned the dirty room to the front desk and were appreciative of the room move it was an inconvenience to us and it was unfortunate that the room wasn\u2019t clean in the first place. **The new room also had a few room deficiencies, which included the tv in the living room not working. The volume was either very low or very loud. Also one of the handtowels in the bathroom had a lipstick stain on it and the remote for the bathroom tv was missing. (After reading other reviews...sounds like a lot of the TVs need an upgrade) **Booked two Spa Treatments under the Spa Specials for the afternoon of New Year\u2019s Eve at 5 pm \u2013 a $100 Gentleman\u2019s Facial and a $100 Deep Tissue Massage. When the bills were presented to us after the treatments, both of the bills were at the regular price. The massage therapist assisted with changing the bill to the correct $100 amount, however my boyfriend had to go to the Spa Receptionist to get the charge corrected. **While getting ready for New Year\u2019s Eve, after having had a relaxing time at the Bathhouse, we discovered that my bf had left his tie in the original room on the hanger at about 8:30 pm. I contacted housekeeping to see if they could assist with locating the tie, they advised that they could not. I requested then that we be passed on to Security (in our hotel, Security is also Lost & Found), unfortunately the gentleman we spoke to said that he could not assist and the Lost & Found Department would not be returning until 9 am the next day. In a hotel that size....how could there not be one single person that could access Lost and Found??? Unfortunately he wanted to wear the tie for NYE and we were leaving the hotel by 8:30 am to get to the airport. I was then passed onto a third person and once again had to repeat my story. My bf could sense that I was getting frustrated having to continually repeat myself and no one having any solutions on getting the tie other than to wait till the following morning so he then took the phone but still the gentleman could not assist. We decided to go by the Front Desk to see what could be done. We met with Mark, who listened to us and then contacted someone to see if they could assist, but the gentleman said that they had already spoken to us and nothing could be done until the morning. We then suggested that perhaps, they could leave a voicemail for the guest in the original room as it was the same guest since Tuesday night and have them check to see if the tie was still in the closet. We were advised that this could not be done and that we would have to wait until housekeeping went in to clean the room after the guest left to check the closet. Mark indicated that they could not disturb the other guest, however I don\u2019t think that leaving a voicemail or a written note for the guest would be called a disturbance or intrusive, especially since we were also paying guests and if we hadn\u2019t been checked into a dirty room to begin with and didn\u2019t have to move because of it this whole situation could have been avoided. To date, we have yet to receive a call to see if the tie has been found or located. Although we had a less than perfect experience at THEhotel, we did want to say that we had some spectacular service in two of the Mandalay Bay outlets and think it would be great if you could share our positive feedback with the managers of both Mizuya and STRIP STEAK. We saw an ad for Mizuya on one of the info cards in the hotel room, so we thought we would check it out. Who knew though that it would be a Scavenger Hunt to find the restaurant. None of the maps in the room or on the gaming floor had Mizuya in the directory. (It might be good to include the information of the location of Mizuya on the promo piece.) After 20 minutes of wandering we were finally able to locate it in the middle of the floor and we were ready for a drink and some food. We almost missed out on the Bento Box special since it took us so long to find the restaurant however our server, John, had an awesome can-do attitude and made it happen. We were looking for a small snack since we had dinner plans for later that evening before the Black Eyed Peas concert. John was gracious, knowledgeable with the different sakes offered and was a wonderful host. He is definitely an asset to the restaurant! On New Year\u2019s Eve, we decided to stay at Mandalay Bay and dine at one of the outlets. We made a reservation at STRIP STEAK for 10:15 pm with the hostess as there was a last minute cancellation. We arrived early to the restaurant since we could not find any black jack tables available on the floor and decided to see if we could have a drink in the lounge instead. When we arrived, we thought that our reservation was nearly lost as they had the wrong first name on the Reservation \u2013 it said Romy instead of Kassandra. Thankfully the last name and the phone number matched since there weren\u2019t too many openings at the other restaurants for that time. Don\u2019t know where Romy came from? Tori our server also deserves some kudos, because after what had been a frustrating hour before hand trying to figure out how to get information about the lost tie and then not being able to find some black jack tables on the floor, she was able to give us some fabulous service which made us forgot all about our frustrations. We had such a wonderful time at the restaurant that we didn\u2019t even make it outside to see the fireworks at midnight. Everytime we mentioned to friends and even the locals we came across that we were staying at THEhotel, we had heard nothing but good things, which is why we were disappointed with our stay. Had it been only one or two things, we probably wouldn\u2019t have been as disappointed but since it was a culmination of things most particularly the way in which the lost tie was handled the stay did not meet our expectations.

The hotel also uses a scent in the main lobby which may bother some people, especially those who are susceptible to perfumes. The hotel's Internet access is $14.99 a day (per 24 hours) and considering the speed, the price is far too expensive. The hotel's charges for other amenities are certainly quite pricey. Even using their telephone for a local call or toll-free call could be a major burden. And, we left a note on the broken CAT-5 cable for their high speed Internet (they offer wireless as well) and nothing was done to repair it. Even the note was left. The televisions, while 42\" (other than the small set in the bathroom) certainly weren't connected on HD... or if it was HD, it was the worst HD we have ever seen.

We were concerned since we got there a bit early that our room wouldn't be ready, but we barely had to wait in line before we were taken to our room. We had a lot of friends and family staying in Mandalay Bay so we spent a lot of time on both sides of the hotel. I liked that The Hotel seemed to be a little quieter than Mandalay Bay. I would say that unless having a small living room is a necessity for your trip you'd do just as well at Mandalay Bay. I prefer the color scheme over there and felt that there wasn't really enough light over in The Hotel. The suite we had was nice, but we didn't really use the living room much and the standard rooms over at Mandalay Bay seem a little more spacious, even though the square footage is smaller, because The Hotel suites are separated into 2 rooms. I spent some time in the spa and found it extremely relaxing. There was almost no one there when I went and the staff showed me around and explained everything that was available and was there to answer questions, but didn't follow me around or bother me when I was trying to relax. All in all we would definitely stay in this hotel again. One thing I would let people know is that if they really want something in the middle of everything in Las Vegas this may not be the hotel for them. It is all the way at the south end of the strip so it is a bit of a hike to get anywhere, but it's still on the strip and the tram to Luxor and Excalibur makes it easy to get over to the rest of the strip. We actually enjoyed being a little bit away from the chaos of the main part of the strip. We also liked that there is a liquor store right across the street so we didn't have to spend the crazy amounts for a drink (which is the case at pretty much every hotel) if we just felt like spending some time in the room. Everything is insanely expensive and pretty much everything is extra, but this seems to be the norm for Las Vegas. The restaurants we ate at were all amazing. We had a small event at China Grill and the food and service were amazing. Raffles Cafe was a great place to eat that wasn't crazy expensive and the wait was never long. The buffet was nothing special, although breakfast was a pretty good deal. One complaint would be the lounge/bar area they have down by the lobby.

We have stayed at a variety of properties, with our last trip to the Four Seasons a big success. For New Years we decided to try THEHotel at Mandalay Bay. Check-in was the start of an unexpectedly unsatisfying stay. We arrived a little before noon and were told we could not check in until 4 pm. Lunch wasn't much better. We had to wait about 20 minutes for a seat at THECafe holding on to a tacky flashing beeper that ultimately didn't work and the hostess resorted to yelling out names to get people seated. Apparently housekeeping can only clean the room when you are in the room as they did clean the room on the first day until 5:30 as we were trying to get ready to meet friends. The most disconcerting aspect of the service is housekeeping's policy of entering the room unannounced and without knocking. Twice either my wife or I were met in the bathroom by housekeeping asking if we needed anything. Another time the minibar guy came into the room to check the minibar while I was watching TV. Not so bad but couldn't he knock and let me answer the door? We finally resorted to throwing the security latch whenever we were in the room for privacy. Several times while we were getting ready to go out we heard the bang of the door against the latch. We tried bringing this to the attention of management but a call to the front desk and a request at the front desk to speak with someone fell on deaf ears. THESpa services were also handled with nonchalance. Checking in my wife was told to \"go around the corner and we'll get to you soon\" rather than the personal treatment she got at the sister spa at Mandalay Bay.

Outside, the amazing Mandalay wave pool and beach setting is waiting for all frolicking and playtime, in preparation for another big night.

Unlike pretty much any other hotel this one smells smoke free, it is off the Mandalay Bay which is itself a breath of fresh air literally. The hotel is linked to the Mandalay Bay casino via a 100m stretch of polished marble slabs, the entrance to the walkway to theHotel is next to the tram so it is very convenient. First of all, this is an all-suites hotel, so for those of you who prefer a separate sitting area where you can have a civilised coffee or room service away from the bed, this is a place for you. The rooms themselves have a minimalist feel, not because they lack amenities but because they have the zen colours. My room was on a corner and had 2 toilets, it was a nicer room than most. The products in the room were high quality branded by the hotel, it does of course have a very famous spa attached to it. There are 2 spas you can access, that of theHotel and the bigger spa of the Mandalay Bay. The Mandalay Bay property is itself one that is consistently ranked by locals as being a place they would stay it on the strip, cited because it doesn't smell smokey and of the outside pool which is amazing in summer. Even those who smoke dont like smokey environments so it is a winner for all. I keep talking about smoke filled environments because that is the norm in LV, it is especially a problem in the centre of the strip where there is more foot traffic, such as the Bellagio. You cant help but stink of smoke by the time you leave most hotels, not in this place. There is the Mix bar which is part of theHotel, the bar itself has a beautiful view of the strip, you can step outside some glass doors to smell the evening LV air, it's really quite a treat and is consistently rated in the top 10 of LV bars. The age range in this hotel is younger than than that of the main Mandalay Bay, talking to people at reservations they said the average age in theHotel is 38 rather than 46 for the Mandalay Bay. It shows a little, it is much quieter than the other hotels in LV. There is a cafe for breakfast which is a little expensive, but the other restaurants in the Mandalay Bay are a short walk away through the casino. I would recommend looking for deals which include a breakfast credit so you can eat at the cafe which is very stylish. The deals that are available are seasonal, my deal included the breakfast credit and a $100 spa credit which were both used making the room cost about $40 which was a complete bargain! Just one final thing, this is I would categorise a hotel for people wanting a quieter break in LV, it has class and is probably a place suited best for people not on their first trip to LV. If you are on your first trip stay in the centre of the strip since taxis are so expensive here you can save alot through just being in walking distance. If you want to be in LV but away from the crowds come here and Enjoy! But to experience the most come when the pools are open.", "Date": "December 19, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco, CA", "Title": "\u201cTHEhotel is THEE hotel to stay at\u201d", "Author": "jr7ruiz", "ReviewID": "UR51495831", "Content": "Excellent service all the way around!!!!

This is our second visit to this particular boutique hotel and just as before it was a very nice stay. One of the main reasons I love this place is that the living room and bedroom are separated by a door. Other Vegas hotel proclaim the have suites but are nothing more than larger rooms with a slight split level. So I can watch my football games in one room and my wife can enjoy her shows in another room and neither of us is bothered. The room itself along with the rest of the hotel exudes a dark motif, which I kind of liked. The front desk was quick and efficient in checking us in and the concierge desk helpful in answering our questions. THE Hotel itself sits right next to the parking structure so you will have a very short walk to the lobby and elevators unlike many other Vegas hotels. Now for the good: The room had three televisions, two bathrooms and all of it very clean along with a mini bar (which we did not use) and no bed bugs to report. The living room had a large plasma screen. The bed was remarkably comfortable and it was mostly very quiet around our room. Our room stayed at a constant 72 degrees our entire stay and the HVAC system was quiet enough not to be noticed. Turn of the hot water faucet and instant hot water comes out, NICE! Our dining option was the Bayside Buffet downstairs. This is an above average buffet in my opinion and should satisfy most tastes. There are ton of food options in walking distance. The Luxor next door has McDonalds and Nathan\u2019s if you want to eat on the cheap. When you get off the elevator, there is a convenience store and small restaurant and bar within feet of each other so you don\u2019t have to walk far at all if you need something quick And now the bad: I\u2019m not a big fan of the Bathhouse Spa. I think it\u2019s too small. And if you need to go to the pool, it a monstrously long walk to get there. Note to the staff, you should have someone checking key cards at the elevators at all times. Reading other people reviews on Trip Advisor I\u2019m hearing of room being burglarized. That\u2019s not acceptable. Finally the ugly: The in room DVD player did not work at all. Not a big deal really but the guests should not have to discover these things for you, not if you\u2019re an upscale hotel. To our surprise, we tried to order some soup to go from one of the restaurants and were told they don\u2019t do take out. OK, fair enough so we went to the Raffles coffee shop and tried to order soup there, they will let you take it out but you have to be seated, order it from a waitress, get the soup, then ask for a container and don\u2019t forget to tip the waitress. What a mess! All that was for a simple bowl of soup. Most MGM Mirage properties are setup now as a maximum profit enterprise. Expect to pay top dollar on everything and declining service. Please don\u2019t be shocked at cost of things here, it is expensive.

However, we did get a good variety of cheeses, crackers and fruits. Bottled water was also expensive - but its what you would expect at any hotel. We ate breakfast in Mandalay Bay - it was good.

Lots of freebee shampoos/body lotion etc. The Hotel at Mandalay Bay links directly to The Mandalay Bay and is a lovely hotel.

This was our third trip to Vegas. Initially, we were given a truly appalling room on the 3rd floor - must be the worst room in the whole of Vegas! Was on a corridor of meetings rooms, so the whole place (inc room) smelt of stale coffee. The view consisted of the air conditioning unit, the car park and staff on their cigarette break - NOT good! The room was also REALLY dark - had to turn a light on to see anything. We asked to be moved but the hotel was full that night apparently (was the Friday before Justin Timberlake so not surprised) but they offered to move us the next day - and they stayed true to their word, moving us up to the 27th floor. Soooo much better - lighter, brighter, nicer all round! This room had floor to ceiling windows (unlike other room), and had a great view of the mountains from the living room, and a strip view from the bedroom. Honestly, it was SUCH a step change in quality, it felt like another hotel! Previous posts have complained of bad service - we found the front desk staff to be very polite but not as friendly as those we encountered at the Palazzo and Signature. Staff in THEcafe were cool but efficient. Staff in the Bathouse Spa were nice but the spa attendants seemed a little disinterested. My massage therapist was excellent. The walk to the pool took me about 10 mins, and in midweek mid-October, there were plenty of chairs available. Also, to get into the pool, every individual needed a room key, which a pool attendant would check and swipe before letting you in - so only guests can enter the pool area. Previous posts also complained about a sewer smell - have to say that we did experience this. Not all the time - most of the time there was this lovely tropical coconut fragrance. But on occasion, the hallways proper honked of a blocked toilet - like that one in Trainspotting, bleurgh! Also, lots of complaints about the location - have to say that it didn't bother us but then, this was our third trip so we'd seen plenty of the strip and knew our way around. Think for Vegas newbies, the location would be awkward. Also, THEhotel is very quiet - has a real boutique feel to it, which I really liked - nice to escape the madness of the casinos.

This is the first time I've reviewed this hotel but we've stayed there 4 times at least. I recommended we stay here based on past experiences. The two friends we met are sisters and wanted to stay in one room. I like the suites at THEhotel due to the fact that they are truly suites with two separate rooms with a door between. Two baths, tvs, etc. They had never stayed at THEhotel and loved the rooms especially with the price we got them for (under 140/nt). The rooms are very similar to the Signature suites at MGM (both are MGM properties) except they don't have kitchens. Many \"suites\" on the strip are just one large room. We prefer two separate rooms. The staff is always helpful, thorough, and polite. They may be a little too chatty during the check in process. Sometimes it can be a little bit of a wait, although we've never waited longer than 15 minutes to check in. The location of Mandalay Bay is a slight draw back as it is at the far south end of the strip. However, it makes it conveninet to get to and from the airport. Also, there is a free monorail that runs from the Luxor (right next to Mandalay Bay and an easy ~5 min walk from the Mandalay Bay Casino) to just opposite the MGM Grand. From the MGM Grand you can take the not free Monorail if you like. There's also the Deuce (bus) but it may be crowded. Although being at the end of the strip the bus is less likely to be crowded especially heading toward the south terminal (where you can catch another bus directly to the airport). We shared a cab from the airport which came to less than $20 for the four of us. The restaurants at Mandalay Bay are generally good but nothing to write home about. We've eaten at the Red, White and Blue where the service was good as was the food. I do highly recommend eating at the Burger Bar which is just outside Mandalay Bay, on the second level toward the Luxor. We've eaten there many times. Prices are very good especially for the quality of the meal and the service. They have angus and Kobe beef available. Excellent burgers. They've also added beer floats to the menu. My first thought was \"no\", but then the waitress mentioned Guiness with coffee ice cream as an option. Love Guiness, love coffee. Easy decision. Glad I tried one. Delicious. I can't imagine many other beers would taste good with ice cream but who knows. As for the casino at Mandaly Bay it is spacious with a nice clientele. Dealers are nice and helpful. The poker room is relatively small but comfortable, located next to/within the sports book which makes it easy to watch practically any sporting event if you get the right seat. The poker room runs two relatively small and cheap tournaments daily. One is about $40 the other about $60. Also, there is a deli right next to the poker room in the sports book which is convenient. There's also a deli nearby in the Luxor, the Back Stage Deli which has good food and good prices. I used to recommend the deli near the poker room and sports book at MGM but the quality of the food has decreased over the past year so I don't anymore. Parking can be self (free) or by valet (tip). Be sure you go in the entrace near THEhotel as the walk though the casino can be long, especially with bags. We absolutely love staying at THEhotel.

So why don't I like this place? I guess what really, really turned me off was that they wanted me to pay 30 bucks per person to work out for an hour. This is absolutely unacceptable. Imagine flying in from overseas and all you want to do is move your sore bones and this hotel seriously wants you to shell out 30 bucks in exchange for an hour on a treadmill! Ridiculous. They say it's because you can use the entire spa etc. Well, I don't need the spa, I want to sweat for an hour and that's that. We never went to the pool area but have been there on one of our previous visits. The pool area is shared with the Mandalay Bay and is nuts in the summer. It is another good reason to stay at the 4S with its own, quiet pool area. Bottom line is that the rooms are better than at the Mandalay, there is no wait at the elevators and in general it has a more upscale feel to it. It would probably deserve a 4 point rating for that.

My husband and I took our 2 kids, ages 21 and 25 for probably our last Family vacation. We had a great time. When we arrived, we were supposed to be staying at the Mandalay Bay hotel. Instead she asked at the front desk is we knew we were actually booked in The Hotel. They put us on the 25th floor with a view of the mountains. Our room had 1 king sized bed and our kids were next door with 2 queen beds. It was the most beautiful room that we have ever stayed in. Very spacious with lots of closet space, 3 tv's, a safe and 2 bathrooms! There were floor to ceiling windows. They supply the best smelling bathroom toiletries. We always came back to a spotless room from the housekeeping service. We found all the staff extremely friendly, especially the cocktail waitresses throughout the casino, very accomodating. We ate mostly at the buffet. This was quite expensive for a family of 4 with each meal close to the $25.00 mark for each person unless you purchased the $35.00 voucher for the entire day for a family of 4 which was a great deal if you were going to be around for the day. The food was very good there where you would find made to order omelettes for breakfast and pasta for dinner.l There was a lot of choice. We went to the pool through the week about 10 a.m. or so and were able to find a chair, no problem. When we arrived on the Sunday, it was very busy in the pool area with no chairs to be found but no problem after that. We enjoyed the lazy river (even without an inner tube which they rented for somewhere around the $23.00 mark) but the wave pool was a joke, 1 wave about every 5 minutes so quite boring but was refreshing. It was very hot there, around 100 degrees every day during our stay. We found the pool area a fair distance away from our room, so be prepared to do a lot of walking in this hotel. We took a taxi several times during our stay and to get to Fremont St. from The Hotel was around the $20.00 mark. We also visited The Boulevard Mall which again with tip was around the $20.00 mark one way. I would recommend going there if you like Victoria's Secret and Bath and Body Works, Macey's and Penney's with Marshalls next door. The mall was not busy at all during the week. We found the shuttle from the airport was anywhere from $6- $7.50 one way per person or roundtrip for as little as $12.00 p.p. We took the cab from The Hotel to the airport and I think it was around the $13.00 mark and that was for the 4 of us so that was much cheaper. We visited The Shark Reef in Mandalay Bay one day through the week. The admission price for each of us was I believe around the $18.00 mark and well worth visiting. It's just like deep sea diving without actually getting into the water. You can wander around at your own leisure so we were there for close to 2 hours. Very enjoyable! We saw the show Jubilee at Bally's hotel. A friend was a dancer in the show and got us cheap tickets for it. I don't know that I would have paid $70-90 for a ticket otherwise but a nice night out. We signed up for a Player's Advantage card at The Hotel, no charge. It can be used at 11 other hotels as well, listed on the card. It was well worth it to do this as we ended up getting some of our meals comped and free play as well in the slot machines. Our 2 kids road the roller coaster at New York New York. They said it was a blast, $14.00 each for a 3 minute ride!! I read some negative reviews on the bad odour in the hotel, in fact, The Hotel has a pleasant fragrance in the hallways leading to the elevators.. It is a bit smokey at times but nothing in comparison to some of the other hotels. So, ignore the negative comments given, I honestly don't get these people. The only negative would be the distance it is from the rest of the hotels on the strip but if you're looking to be a little quieter, this would be the place to stay.. I would definitely stay at The Hotel again and did not find anything run down about it at all as some other reviews lead you to believe.

The pool became very crowded at times, but we never had a problem finding a place to sunbathe. It was also great having a separate entrance for THEhotel, it made arrival and departure very easy.

Last time we were in Vegas, we stayed at The Luxor so we had a good idea of how far south of the strip The Hotel actually was. As I was the lead booker for our trip I was starting to become quite anxious about some of the negative reviews that have been posted. DO NOT WORRY! Who cares if The Hotel entrance is inside the parking garage - the only time you spend there is getting in & out of taxis and if it bothers you that much, get dropped off at The Mandalay Bay entrance & walk through the casino! There was no queues when we checked in (I suppose this all depends on how many flights are coming in) and all the check-in staff were very pleasant. All 10 of us were either upgraded to 'V' Suites or given comp Spa passes. IMO the 'normal' suites (if you can call them normal) had much better storage space than the upgraded suites. We had a Queen size bed with 2 double wardrobes, 2 large sets of drawers next to the bed and a separate storage area with shelves and more drawers (and the safe) under the TV. Friends that were in the 'V' suite only had 1 double wardrobe & 1 set of drawers and the only difference in the upgrade was they had 2 corner windows. We hardly used the lounge area but to re-iterate what other reviewers have said, the bathrooms were fab. The bath was that deep that you couldn't just relax in it like you do at home because you kept sinking! The toiletries were topped up daily and in general the rooms were cleaned very nicely every day. If you are planning a trip to Vegas, please consider where on the strip you would actually like to be based instead of writing negative reviews about the location. The Hotel was a nice quiet relaxing place to escape the 'mad,noisy' world of Las Vegas. Taxi's ranged from $6 to $20 depending on where you were going and we did travel on the 'deuce' double decker bus a couple of times but that's another story! The only negative point I have to comment on were the lack of shady areas/umbrellas around the pool. It was over 100deg when we were there and all of us could only manage 2 hrs max around the pool first thing in the morning!

This time around I arrived on a Saturday (during football season) and stayed for three nights. I booked this trip in mid-August and found a rate for $149 on Saturday and only $89 for Sunday and Monday nights through the THEhotel website. To put this in perspective, there are many times that the rooms (suites actually as all the rooms in THEhotel are suites), go for $400 or more per night on weekends and $250 or more per night on weekdays. As all the rooms are suites, you enter into a small marble hallway with a half bath. There is a nice size living room with a sofa, chairs, wet bar, desk and a large entertainment center with plasma TV and DVD player. The bedrooms have a king or two queen beds, small sitting area and a large entertainment/wardrobe closet with ample drawers, hangers, safe and a 27\u201d flat screen TV. Both the living room and bedroom have floor to ceiling windows with a view of the pool and mountains on one side or the strip on the other. There is a nice size main bathroom with a soaking tub, large separate marble shower, large vanity with two sinks and large make-up mirror and a separate room with a toilette. I have seen some negative reviews lately regarding the condition of the rooms and the property in general. Having stayed at THEhotel and at Mandalay Bay at least 8 times, I have always found the rooms and public areas to be clean, well maintained and the staff to be very attentive. When ever you have 5,000 rooms, there are bound to be isolated problems that come up. But having stayed at every major hotel in Vegas from the Venetian to MGM, The Mirage to the Excalibur and most if not all in between, THEhotel and Mandalay Bay win the award for consistently maintaining a high standard of quality. One of the best features of THEhotel is the pool complex. While the only separate facility THEhotel has from Mandalay Bay is the Bathhouse Spa, everything else (pool, casino, Mandalay Bay Spa, etc.) is shared. The pool complex is one of the largest in Vegas (perhaps second only to MGM). It is the only hotel in Vegas that has a wave pool. There is also a lazy river lagoon pool (though not as large or as nice as MGM\u2019s), two standard type pools, a private cabana pool (accessible only if you rent a cabana), the Moorea Beach Club (this is an adults only pool, tops optional for women) and a pool reserved only for guests of The Four Seasons (part of the three hotels that make up Mandalay Bay). A word of advice, on any busy weekend from late April through early October, the pool area, especially the beach, is packed with people. You need to get to the pool early (it opens at 9:00 AM) and get a chaise. Otherwise you\u2019ll spend more time looking for a spot to sit then you will soaking up the sun. If you enjoy a nice spa experience then head to the Spa Mandalay in Mandalay Bay. About the only negative thing I have to say about THEhotel is that the bathhouse spa is not a good spa. The gym, spa facilities (steam, sauna, whirlpools, relaxation rooms, etc.) were in fair to poor condition on my last visit in February 2009. I now only go the Spa Mandalay which is completely the opposite of the bathhouse. In fact, I would rate Spa Mandalay one of the best, if not the best, spa in all of Vegas. Caesars Palace may still hold my number one ranking (it\u2019s the only spa in Vegas that has an \u201cice room\u201d where it actually snows from the ceiling), but Spa Mandalay in an excellent facility with a great staff, ample gym equipment and very soothing surroundings. It\u2019s $30 per day with a three day discount available. As with most of the upscale Vegas hotels, there\u2019s a wide variety of restaurants and bars and clubs. If you can get in, I strongly suggest the House of Blues Foundation Room. It\u2019s on the top of Mandalay Bay with arguably one of the best views of Vegas. You need to be an invited guest or a Foundation Room member to get in, but on quiet, less crowed nights you may be able to get the bouncers at the elevator to let you in. There is also the MIX lounge, nightclub and restaurant on top of THEhotel but the view is nothing like the one from The Foundation Room.

The suite had 1.5 baths and a living room/office/bar area. All were clean, spacious and airy. The main bathroom was fantastic separate toilet area from the double sinks and large deep bath with separate glass shower stall. All were clean so I was actually comfortable with using the tub (something I generally don't do outside my own home) The bathroom had a small tv mounted on the wall so I could watch while taking my baths which was kind of fun (wish I had that at home) If i had been their longer I would have wanted some bubble bath but the hotel does provide bath salts to use. The mini bar was fully loaded but I couldnt' find a price list for it as hard as I looked so I didn't touch anything. Their is a small shop close to the elevators that has most things you would need anyway so I stopped their before going to bed to get drinks and snacks. The staff was all very accomodating we had accumulated a lot of luggage by this point in the trip so we had the bell staff bring it up and they were all very polite accomodating and seemed very intersted asking questions about where we were from what we were going to do at THEhotel giving advice on shows and concerts that were onsite. We asked the bellman how far it was to Mandolay Bay as we would be going their to eat and gamble and he laughed and said it was right down the hall (THEhotel tower looks far from the mandolay bay structure from the outside but it was really just down the hall). We had an issues upon check in realizing that we left a spa bag containing some bathing suits hairbrushes ect. in the taxi so we called the front desk asking for some advice (we never got the bag back because we were too preoccupied to note the taxi company and cab number something i'll never neglect to do again) but the front desk was great she transfered us to the lost and found and sent up a phone book so we could call some cab companies.

So we looked at the room.... two hard uncomfortable double beds and the suite itself was way smaller than the previous suites we had stayed in, even though they denied this...TV's were also prehistoric, and not flat screens like in the other suites. My husband returned to reception and complained twice to be told there was nothing they could do. I was tired and angry at this point, so we returned to reception to ask to speak to the manager, at which point they miracously produced a corned suite which they kept telling us was an 'upgrade' Throughout the six days we were there i frequently heard business men in the lifts saying what a great corner room they had been given!! I'm not sure what THE hotels problem is, or maybe it was just the receptionist who had an attitude problem?? DO NOT settle for a crappy room though. The rooms are still large with huge bathrooms, but are started to look a bit dated... The pool was great Monday through Thursday and did not have any problem finding a sun lounger, but come Friday the pool was heaving by mid morning. Yes the hotel is full of young, sometimes drunk people, especially at weekends, but hey this is Vegas, what do you expect! and everyone is friendly.

It keeps the riff raff away. We had a 5 hour session at one of those tables and made a few hundred bucks. Had a million drinks also while our waitress was gorgeous and very attentive. We stayed at Mandalay all weekend, as there's no reason to go anywhere else. People complain on here that its at the farthest end of the strip and you have to take taxis everywhere. Wouldn't you know that before you get here by looking on a map? Go figure. The Beach area is pretty cool with a casino area upstairs that has great drinks and fun dealers. We had a friend staying at the Four Seasons next door, so we wandered over to his pool area and that place is pure heaven! They cater to your every need over there, but wait I'm here to write about The Hotel.

We arrived late and they had no smoking suites left. After several minutes of back and forth on the equity of prepaying for a suite and not getting one the first of four nights, they offered a $100 food and beverage credit. We were moved into a suite the next day (after several trips to the desk to check if one was ready throughout the day) and it was beautiful. Not a great view but the room decor and having 2 bathrooms was awesome and maid service was excellent. My husband and I lost a few hundred playing blackjack the last night and the table dealers ranged from surly to extremely helpful. The concierge was a jerk when my husband asked about transportation on the strip and basically blew him off. So it was really hit or miss as to the level of service you received from any particular individual. The valets were great and were more than happy to help with directions and suggestions. We ate at RM Seafood, Border Grill and Strip Steak for dinner. All three were excellent and the wait staff were top notch. Polite, friendly and accommodating. The highlight for me was seeing and getting to meet Chef Rick Moonen who stepped into the dining room at RM during our meal. He was so nice and it was amazing to see a celebrity chef who actually works in their own restaurant. Definitely get a Players Club card to track your bets on slots or blackjack. I registered on-line and we picked up the cards before making our first bet. An added bonus is that the same card can be used at several MGM hotels on the strip so I also used it at the MGM Grand and the Luxor. After three days of betting, I had over 6,000 points and we were comped $400 of food and beverage charged to our room. Again to illustrate the disparity in service, when we picked up our player's cards the gentleman barely spoke to us. I asked about linking our cards and was told he could do that. When we checked the next day we found he hadn't linked them and that was quickly remedied by someone more helpful at the club desk. Additionally, the second gentleman gave us two passes to the buffet (decent food) and told us (against the rules) what the approximate value of our points were. The irony was that the same gentleman we got when we picked up our cards was working the day we were leaving and of course, I got him. What a turn around in attitude once he saw the points I'd racked up in a few days, he was basically falling all over himself to tell me what a great customer I was and how they would be pleased to comp our entire bill. He went on to say that had we booked directly through Mandalay, our rooms would have been comped as well. No worries since I got an excellent package deal through Delta but it was nice to know they could be pleasant at some point suring our stay. One note, make sure you visit the Player's Club desk immediately before checking out. If you check out first, they will do nothing for you as far as comps. The helpful gentleman on Day 2 alerted us to this fact and I was very grateful as it turned out being worth $400 for us. Overall, we liked TheHotel and would probably stay again. Just be prepared for inconsistent levels of service. The clientele ranged from partiers in their early 20's to older, married couples looking for a more sedate vacation. In comparison, we went to MGM Grand to see Ka (excellent!) and it was a zoo. It seemed everyone there was in party mode and there was a plethora of hooker heals, barely there dresses and lots of young, drunk guys drooling over the throngs of girls cruising the casino. Compared to the Luxor and MGM Grand, Mandalay's casino is much larger and nicer as well. If you can get past some of the bad service and attitudes, this is a nice place to stay and there were a lot of people who did provide excellent service and made our anniversary memorable.", "Date": "September 20, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Omaha, Nebraska", "Title": "\u201cIf you have already booked your reservation---keep it...place is wonderful\u201d", "Author": "nmata", "ReviewID": "UR42632707", "Content": "We arrived yesterday at Thehotel and so far this place has been great.

Bottom-line, we loved it. Arrival: It is unfortunate that you have to snake through the parking garage to get to the Valet entrance to THE Hotel (it is separate from the Mandalay Bay main entrance) but once you are inside, it is awesome. Unlike most big hotels in Vegas you are completely separate from the casino area (it's a quick walk, but you can't hear or see it from THE Hotel's entrance) the lobby is modern and very calming. Nice change from the hustle and bustle of Vegas. Anyway, upon checking in we were told that we were being upgraded to a corner \"V Suite\" because our \"THE Suite\" was no longer available. Other than the extra windows and nice view, I didn't see much difference in the V Suite from the diagram of the \"THE Suite\", of course, it was all very nice. Our room was very clean and spacious (two rooms..a bedroom and a sitting area with wet bar) and the 1 and 1/2 baths that come standard were great too. The master bathroom was as nice or nicer that any of the rooms/suites I've stayed in in other hotels (Venetian, Bellagio, Palazzo, Caesar's, etc...) and the tub was huge, although there were no jacuzzi jets...but plenty of room for two. The ameneties were very nice (shampoo, soap, bath salts, etc...) and the robes provided were the softest I've ever worn. (never put on the slippers though). The room was proved to be an excellent place to host a pre-dinner cocktail party for 7 other couples as there is a wet bar in the living room. We played some \"party CD's\" in the TV/DVD player and had a great time. Spent Friday at a Cabana at the Mandalay Beach....that's the way to roll down there. Nice to have the shade and a \"base of operations\" along with a very attentive staff and waiters/waitresses. Water and towel services are provided with the cabanas as well as a fan and even a TV if you want to watch. Cabanas are a bit pricy (low end was $250) but we got a $100 cabana credit with our room rate so it wasn't too bad. Definitely worth it and all our friends really enjoyed sharing it with us. Didn't eat much at the hotel, but did enjoy a nice meal at Noodles in the Mandalay and at \"THE Cafe\". Only downside was that the hallways had an odd (and albiet mild) odor that I wasn't sure if it was intended or not but it smelled a bit like cheap air freshener on a bad odor.

We were both a bit hesitant because you don't usually get something for nothing but we were impressed!

The service was professional and personable, they truly go the extra mile to make you feel like they want to give you top service and found the accommodations to be above average and in competition with some of the luxury hotels. No, it's not the Four Seasons or Mandarin Oriental or Ritz Carlton but you aren't paying those prices so you should judge accordingly. There are some caveats though...it's a considerable trek to the pool, no coffee maker in the room (just silly considering how Starbucks is all the way in Mandalay and who really wants to do the walk of shame when you not really right in the head?) and I thought the room service prices were a bit ridiculous ($25 for an american breakfast? really?). Despite all that...we would return again...our small children were not spit upon and actually received a few smiles (they are sweet and well behaved after all) and they loved loved loved our room and space to run around in. Plus...if you care at all about the pool quality...the pools here ROCK!

Don't waste your money on tipping the front desk. Also, I was never offered help with my bags. Room: This is where the problems began. The first room we were in was very nice, but the air conditioner did not work. I went downstairs and we were supposedly upgraded to the V Suite. The V Suite has 1/4 the amount of closet space of the regular room. We were staying for a week and were frustrated. We didn't want to move again, so we stayed put. The shower did not work nor did the scale, but those did get fixed and we were comped a $100 food and beverage credit. The room itself is nice. The bathroom is huge and the tub is large enough to swim in. They also give you bath salts which is a nice touch. It also is truely a suite. Overal the room was very nice once everything was fixed. It also was great to have two bathrooms and two large plasmas. I also loved having a tv in the bathroom. Housekeeping: They need to get their act together. Basically, housekeeping sucked. The left cleaning towels and bottles in our room. Also they only do cleaning till 5:30 and no turndown service. They tend to come late in the day. I actually called one morning and told them we wanted the room clean. Four hours later no one came. What a dissapointment. The Pool: The pool is a mess. If you go after 8:00 good luck getting a chair or finding an attendent to get one for you. This place is laiden with kids and they charge $25 for a tube for lazy river which is insane. I really think like the Signature MGM the guests of THE Hotel should have their own pool. It was fun and what not but it was just way too crowded and the side pools were freezing. Check out: A NIGHTMARE- I prepaid the room and the charged me for nights at the wrong rate and also had a tax increase which I was NEVER informed of. The bill was corrected and we were given a hefty credit, but the people who work here were not on the ball. Restaraunts: The restaraunts in Mandalay Bay are amazing.

The carpet also felt dirty and damp (confirmed looking at the bottom of my feet). Mirrors and glass were covered in finger prints and water spots. You would think housekeeping had missed the room, but that was not the case, as beds were made properly, amenities stocked, and tissue paper folded with sticker seal. They simply do a very sloppy job of cleaning rooms. Housekeeping issues do not end there. During my recent stay of several days, during which I was out of the room for at least 5 hrs during every day, they serviced the room by the time I returned a total of only one time. Shower drain backed up on this visit as well. Plasma TVs are a nice touch, however the cable signal is terrible. Shaky pictures, not very sharp, and basically only 1 setting for volume. Parking valet quality varies depending on who you get. A few were very good, but many others simply left me to load or unload my trunk on my own, when it was obvious I had a lot of cargo to move.

Even with all our problems, the staff was helpful and professional, always friendly and willing to help. The three pools, wave pool and lazy river were by far the best part of my trip. It gave me something to do besides gamble and if you got there early enough, you could enjoy the area before all the kids arrived, haha It was also nice to have an actual activity instead of just tanning and then dipping and then tanning, etc. etc. Now on to the bad. - Elevators were overpopulated and always slow. We'd never be able to get on the first try. We'd have to let 2 go by at least before we found one empty enough to allow us on. It was ridiculous. - Not a convenient location. It's just too far down on the strip from the main area. - Nice hotel but signs of being unecessarily cheap. For instance, we had to file a claim with the hotel b/c the friend we were with was taking the ironing board down and since it was GLUED onto the wall instead of screwed, it fell straight off and hit his toe, injuring him to the point where we though it might be broken. They also didn't have any fitted sheets for any of the beds, which meant you would wake up on top of the mattress b/c obviously w/out fitted sheets, the sheets just move around when you move at night. RIDICULOUS, if you ask me. This isn't a Motel 6 for goodness sakes; I think they can afford a small investment for some fitted sheets. - The room itself was nice but beware if you're traveling with anyone you might not want to undress in front of. The bathroom has a huge window on the side of the wall, above the bathtub, that looks out into the hallway as you first walk into the room. This means anyone walking into your room can look in on you taking a shower or undressing in the bathroom. I hung a sheet up to avoid this but still, I think it's a dumb way to construct a room unless it's the Honeymoon Suite. There were a few other annoying occurances (like, them sending us to a smoking room after we requested a non or sending our couple friends to a room that hadn't even been CLEANED yet) but the points above are my main beef.

This hotel definitely is great for families, despite their young and hip decor and styling. Our teens loved it. The rooms were quiet and spacious. We found a quick way to get to the pool after a few tries. The rooms could have been a little cleaner. There were ink stains on our bed linens and nail polish stains on the hotel robes hanging in the closet. It didn't bother us, as we knew they were clean, but it surprised me a bit. The furniture in the living room was a little worn, but again nothing that bothered us. The carpet could have been vacuumed better. These are all very small things to us, but someone else may be unhappy with that. I wish they offered free wi fi in the rooms. There was a sewage issue when we were there, as one person said already.

I guess the suite layout of the hotel rooms means that they can pack more people into a room. A couple of things to know: -You have to go through the casino to get to the beach/pools, unlike at Mandalay Bay where the elevators go directly to the beach/pools. -The entrance is in the parking structure and it gets really hot and humid there because of the misting fans. There isn't direct access from the parking elevators and you will have to walk a ways. So be warned, if you have a lot of stuff or if it's really hot. -If you want to go to MIX, it closes early on Sundays. -If you use the entrance and exit from the parking structure that is at the back end near the freeway, you can bypass a lot of the horrible strip traffic.", "Date": "August 22, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, IL", "Title": "\u201cLoved this place\u201d", "Author": "MQadeer", "ReviewID": "UR38002987", "Content": "Far down the strip, but probably best room we have ever had, on vacation for the price.

Next, I booked my stay here based upon a promotion. The promotion on the website read receive a 50 credit for food & beverages at the House of Blues (foundation room). First , this is not what they told me at check-in. So, in order for me to receive a 50 credit I needed to spend $100.00. Next it was at the foundation room which is not the everyday House of Blues. Supposedly, it is fine dining part of House of Blues. Well, I didn't know this. I guess if you don't read or ask every little detail of the promotion then this is what happens. Beware!! Now, I was stressed after all this. What they finally did was give me a $75 credit to 4-5 places in the hotel area to use. The buffet, cafe, coffee shop, another one. Turned out the cafe in THE Hotel was very good. Two breakfasts and there went the credit. The rooms are nice. Yes, they are dark but you get used to it. THE Hotel itself is dark but it puts you in a relaxed mood as opposed to the hustle and bustle of Mandalay Bay casino. The beach over rated... full of kids... We were able to get a good spot with the red chairs & red umbrellas. Kids fine, however there are too many lifeguards in and around the wave pool. I understand they might need to do this so there is no risk to Mandalay Bay, however several of them are loud and it gets old hearing them over and over yelling at everyone..

Their is no fridge in the room except the minibar so we took out all their drinks and put in our own and then replaced them when we went out. That was a pain but not the end of the world. We were on holiday after all. The hotel is wonderfully quiet and the room service is quick and efficient. We had a room on the 30th floor right at the end of the corridoor which was perfect as it wasn't far from the elevator and of course we had no-one walking past our door to get to their rooms. We didn't eat in TheHotle as it was too expensive - we walked to The Mandalay Bay instead. TheHotel does needs its own pool area as the Mandalay Bay pool was too busy and too noisy.

Our experience right from the start, beginning with the check in met our expectations. Since we flew in late Sunday night arriving at THE hotel around 10:30 pm Vegas time, we experienced no line ups, and no waiting what-so-ever. We were greeted by a well dressed, very polite and professional gentleman behind the counter, who had us on our way to our suite within minutes (We also used the 20 dollar tip trick and it seemed to work.). THE hotel appearance, halls ways, elevator areas, the lobby, THE cafe, etc all looked spectacular and were filled with fresh cut flowers, polished floors, pristine mirrors and high class decor. We were situated on the 30th floor, at the very end of the hallway. The very unique carpeted floor\u2019s and wall artwork on the way to the suite added to the already beautiful hotel. When we entered our suit, we were very pleased, as the room itself, looked just like the virtual walk through on THE hotels website. Everything was perfectly cleaned, polished, re-supplied, with nothing out of place. Our view from the bedroom was amazing, overlooking the Luxor, Excalibur, MGM, and of course, the strip as far as the eye could see. We took our time unpacking, and familiarized ourselves with our suite. The bed and linens were so comfortable, you'll definitely get a good night\u2019s rest, even if it\u2019s only for a couple of hours, and after all, you're in Vegas. The bathroom was absolutely awesome, the tub fits two people with room to spare, and the water comes up to your neck.(I'm 6' 4\", so I was impressed) The steam shower, his and hers sinks, the TV in the bathroom, the marble floors and counter tops, the additional bathroom, plasma TVs, office desk etc, were without a doubt very well designed for a pleasurable stay. The elevators were divided into two areas separating the lower floors from the higher floors, and for that reason, the longest we had to wait for an elevator, was about 45 seconds, including Friday and Saturday when Vegas gets really busy. The cleaning staff were always smiling, very professional, and made sure to say hello even in passing, and to have a good day or to wish us good luck. (Just a nice added touch I thought) Inside your room, you have a very well stocked mini-bar, chocolates, munchies and more, which are very over priced mind you(4.25 USD for a can of Pepsi is ridiculous) so if you\u2019re on a budget at all, just hit up a Walgreens down the strip. THE hotel also has a very reliable internet service, either wired or wireless, for a whopping $15.00 per 24 hour period. There is a small convenience store near the lobby cleverly named THE store, which had everything you need, but was somewhat overpriced as is any convenience store inside any hotel in Vegas.(Once again, hit up a Walgreens) Since THE hotel shares everything Mandalay bay has to offer, I think it\u2019s fair to critique its restaurants, casino and pool area as well. The casino is like every other casino in Vegas; you have to walk through it to get anywhere. Make a note though, there are no $5.00 Blackjack tables here, $10,$15,$25,$50,$100 etc are what you\u2019ll find, if you want cheaper gambling, you\u2019ll find yourself heading down the strip. The restaurant selection is very good as far as I\u2019m concerned, a little bit of everything for everyone, but if you\u2019re on a tight Vegas budget, simply head over to the Luxor Food court for some fast food, otherwise, be sure to stop by Red White and Blue. For about $90.00 for two people you can enjoy a pleasurable dining experience, great food, and great service. As far as Pool area\u2019s go, Mandalay Bay has one of the best I\u2019ve ever seen. The wave pool with its imported beach sand, poolside casino, restaurants etc made you feel like you were actually at a Caribbean resort. If you want to get a good seat though, make sure your down at the pool around 8:00 a.m. when it opens. If by chance you sleep in, and the place is packed, just head over to one of the private pool areas like Monerra, keep in mind though, this particular area is \u201cEuropean Style\u201d which is a clever way of saying Topless optional, and you have to pay to get in.($10 for women, and $40 for men) Overall, the wavepool area rocks. Cons: - No coffee maker in the room (It seems that in Vegas, normal amenities don\u2019t apply, everywhere else in the world, a coffee maker is standard, but not at any of the major hotels in Vegas supply one. Since we knew this already, we purchased a very small single cup coffee maker before we left for Vegas and brought it with us.) - No free internet service. (Paying for internet when staying at any hotel is a weird concept for me, but this wasn\u2019t a big enough deal for me to have it affect my stay.) - Pricing. (This one oddly enough goes without saying, if we wanted a cheap trip, we wouldn\u2019t have gone to Las Vegas, but it should be mentioned. The mini-bar\u2019s pricing is horrendous, and the drinks at the pool are ridiculous. $10.00 for a strawberry Daiquiri at the pool, but its free when you\u2019re gambling. The price didn\u2019t stop me though, they were delicious. Room service is way overpriced as it is anywhere, but keep in mind the food was excellent. - TV Channels were pathetic. (Not that we were watching too much TV, but the channel selection was horrible. They have these beautiful 42\u201d plasma TV\u2019s in the living room and bedroom, but hardly any channels, and the picture quality of the channels they did have, made the 42\u201d TV\u2019s kind of redundant. - Bottom of the Strip. (THE hotel and Mandalay bay are at the Southern end of the strip. The last large hotel, so you\u2019re a ways away from everything, and it\u2019s about 6 miles (12 klms) from Circus Circus, and let me tell you, walking their takes a while. Overall Impression: Even though there are a few cons as with any place you go to, they were so minuscule, they didn\u2019t affect our stay in any way, shape, or form. We were presently surprised and impressed, and would recommend THE hotel to friends and family. The surroundings, the service, and the staff, made our honeymoon a memorable one and will go back again.", "Date": "August 15, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "delaware", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Stay\u201d", "Author": "k5116", "ReviewID": "UR37737217", "Content": "We had originally booked a room at Mandalay Bay however we arrived early and our room was not ready.

Some of the complaints are pretty laughable. I had an incredible stay from start to finish. Check in: Easy. Took 5 minutes. Completely friendly greeting after getting dropped off from the airport. Yes, the entrance is in a parking garage. But seriously, who cares? The registration staff was professional and friendly. It took about 8 minutes to check in from the minute I got in line to getting my key. Check out was equally as courteous and fast. I was asked how my stay was and the attendant was genuinely happy to hear that I loved my stay. The Room: It is dark. Again, who cares. I was with a group of friends, including women, and no one complained. The women had no trouble with putting on their makeup. The bathroom is amazing. There is one complaint about the toilets, and they are fairly \"low flow\" but if there's a problem, you know, you can flush twice. Being from New York, all I can say is that the bathroom is bigger than many bedrooms I've seen. I've actually been in studios smaller than the bathroom. I was on a fairly high floor - 26th - with pool view (I could see Luxor reflected in the Mandalay Bay tower! Woo hoo) and a clear view of aircraft on their ascent. The people complaining about the airport being loud are either exaggerating or have exceptionally good hearing. I never once heard a plane. Even at the pool you can barely hear the planes. The bed is incredibly comfortable. The housekeeper was wonderful. Did an amazing job and replaced my toiletries as necessary. Everything was impeccably clean. Admittedly, some of the furniture was a little worn. For example, wear & tear cracks on the coffee table. But again - it's Vegas, you're not there to stare at your coffee table or search for dust behind the tv. The TV's are like any large screen tv meant to be in HD that aren't. The picture is poor. Unless you're with kids who will have to be holed up in the room at night - who cares? It serves the purpose. The Lobby: I love everything about the lobby level of THEhotel. The bartenders in the lounge were incredibly friendly and poured good drinks with a grear selection of top shelf. We made a point of stopping for several pre-dinner drinks every night and back after we were done with the tables on our way back in. I love the general decor and feel of the lobby area. It is really understated compared to some of the other top tier vegas hotels. I also happen to love whatever scent permeates the lobby. I wish they bottled it. Though, if you have smell sensitivity it may bother you. (I sometimes can be, and it took me a few minutes to get used to the odor at the Palazzo, which was pleasant too but hit my allergies. I didn't have that problem at THEhotel.) I love that the lobby is dark. It generally has a quiet feel. It is clearly a different mood than Mandalay Bay. Most of the \"action\" takes place at Mandalay. We didn't make it up to Mix, but I wish I did just to grab a drink and take in the view. Mandalay has an amazing restaurant selection. Shanghai Lilly was incredibly enjoyable. Next time I'm definitely trying Fleur de Lys and RM seafood also has a great menu. For cheaper fare (lunch) - Burger Bar and House of Blues are decent. We didn't try any of the more economical options because an important part of our trip was dinner each night. I was a little disappointed with the \"beach.\" I think it's a little overrated, and my only negative experiences were at the beach, which is technically part of Mandalay. I like the pools at MGM and Caesar's much better. (Though with the Octavious Tower the re may be too much shade at Caesar's) The first couple days we made the mistake of getting there early, and at the point it is overrun by kids. We learned that going after lunch (2-3PM) the kids are thinned out and it's a little more \"adult\" friendly. We're in our late 20's and early 30's and were there to unwind from stressful jobs and just get drunk and get tan. It's hard to do that with kids around. Now - I was carded at the Bikini Bar and the bartender was kind of a jerk about it. Seriously, I'm a pretty trusting person, but in July/August it's too hot to spend too much time out of the pool and I'm not going to leave my wallet unattended, so I'm not bringing my ID. Fortunately, the waitresses were much friendlier and used more common sense. Hopefully they didn't have to share their tips. The other major problem was a new rule that you can't bring drinks in the water. Seriously? You could sit over the pool with your legs in the water and that was acceptable. Have no idea if this is unuque to Mandalay or Vegas wide. While obnoxious, most of the lifeguards who had enforce it seemed embarassed to do so and we appreciated that. The others seemed to take pleasure in yelling at guests like 10 year olds. Seriously, they should treat the groups ordering drinks better than they treat families with kids. We and other groups were odering two beer buckets at a time for $64 + tip every 45 minutes or so for almost $400 a day. It adds up.

When in reception trying to find out our room change details, met another family with the same experience. Despite the high cost of this hotel, the service and amenities provided are very poor. If you are fair skinned and want to use the beach facilities, be prepared to spend even more money to have some shade. There is one small area, crowded out early, planted with palm trees to provide shade, otherwise you will need to pay $68 for a padded sunbed (each) and $40 dollars for a sunshade. You cannot just hire a sunshade. Otherwise you could hire a cabanna at a cost varying from $300. A lot of extra money just for some shade - haven't the management of this hotel heard of skin cancer??? If you want to go in the Lazy River, bring your own tubes!! Seriously, yet more dollar grabbing!!! $25 Dollars for a large tube, $15 for a smaller one. I really objected to these outdoor charges. You cannot be expected to use a lazy river without a tube so why provide a lazy river without the full facility being available, and it costs very little to provide sunshades to take some cover from the 40+ degrees (centigrade) of heat. I have stayed in some fantastic hotels around the world and never before been expected to pay for these extras.

THEhotel does have a gorgeous lobby area, it is dark, but I think that's part of the ambiance. 2. Check-in was great. I had read Vegas tips and gave the clerk a $20. GREAT TIP! Didn't get charged the extra fee for a 3rd person and got a strip view without asking. 3. Room was nice. Upon checking out the snacks in the room, found someone had eaten the Pringles but made it look like they didn't. Room could have been a little cleaner, but nothing disgusting. Beds were great, one person even slept on the couch and found it comfortable. TV volume control wasn't great. Could hear a lot of noise at all hours (housekeeping at 2am???) from hallway and other rooms. But oddly, not between the sitting area and the bedroom. 4. Wireless internet was iffy at best - bad considering the per day charge, when using the ethernet cable provided, service was better. 5. Had to ship a package, clerk at business services was great - carefully boxed my item for me. 6. Pool area was nice - we spent one morning there one lounge chairs. Sand could really use a good screening. Trash needs to be picked up better - OR people could actually throw their own trash away. The pool area would be much nicer if about 1/3 of the chairs were removed - very hard to walk around. I understand the area is busy, but still too many chairs. Wave pool was great - but didn't understand why lifeguards insisted everyone stand at a certain depth. 7. Cabanas - we did rent a cabana for one day - that was nice - good service - however - meal selections were pretty sparse. The setup for the cabanas is ok, but there is no real walkway to get to them without walking through other cabana areas - in part because of all the chairs. 8. Room service - VERY RUDE! My friend had ordered a cake for me from a local bakery. We called to get plates, etc. They charged us for them because the cake was not from them and were rude about it. We also called just to get hot water and a mug so I could make hot tea and they were rude about that also. We did also call for a phone book, which was brought immediately and very politely.

The room was lovely - very modern and plush and view was spectacular. The bathrooms were huge and the bath was the biggest I've ever seen and we enjoyed plenty of time relaxing after the full on days of shopping. The lounge area was vast and even bigger than the bedroom itself - all very nice, but because of the amount of time spent away from the room, we only ever walked through the lounge and didnt spend any time there, so in future we know that a suite is just unneccessary (but very nice none the less). The hotel also gave us US$100 to spend within their complex as an extra appology, which was very unexpected but much appreciated. The only negative we could give about this hotel is its location, as everything else was spot on. Being at the far end of the strip, you are a long way out and upon reflection, we wouldnt stay here again because of it.

Pros: 1. Elegant, modern decor and furnishings (see Con section on colors) 2. 2 bathrooms - half bath behind suite door and full bath in bedroom 3. Separate glass shower area and the largest soaking tub I have ever seen! Cons: 1. Everything was either black or dark brown in color. Elegant looking at night, but a little somber during the day and made it feel like sleeping in a night-club. I know its trying to be a boutique hotel, still too dark for me. 2. Slightly frayed at the edges - some of the wallpaper had scratchs/damage, the bathroom door had some dents - probably from drunken guests I'm sure.

When we got there, we had the RUDEST female check us in. She hardly talked to us and rushed us through check in. I asked her if we could get a view of the pool or strip, she ignored me and never answered. She was not nice, didnt ask us any questions about our stay, nothing. The main problem is that she forgot to tell us about our pool credit, and some other stuff we were supposed to get with our reservation (the guy told us when we checked out, thanks....). TheHotel is very dark, which is kind of depressing. The entrance to the hotel is inside of a parking garage. We got to our room on the 17th floor and the view was horrible. We were looking down at a rooftop. Out the living room window was the airport/highway, and out the bedroom was the pool and a little tiny piece of the strip (only if you stuck your cheek to the window). But directly below was very ugly rooftop. The entire suite seemed small and dark to me. We made reservations at Stripsteak for our anniversary dinner, and we told them at that time it was our anniversary. We picked it because we thought it was going to be a classy steak and seafood restaurant. Not the case. It was really trendy and young. They sat us in an overflow bar looking area, at a table which was round and about 2 feet across, and one side was a huge couch with too many pillows. The waitress took at least 10 minutes to come over to us and wanted to take our order and I had to remind her she hadnt even taken our drink order. She barely ever came around. Do not go here if you want to have a nice dinner. We SHOULD have gone to SW Steakhouse at the Wynn (we thought about leaving).... How could we have ordered steaks and seafood and appetizers at a 2 foot across table? They brought other tables out some fries with dipping sauces, we never got that either. My husband was so upset, he ordered the Kobe burger ($22) and barely ate it, I had a halibut ($40), and it tasted like I made it at home. The truffle macaroni ($14) was the best part. At the end of our meal, they brought us out a Happy Anniversary card, lame. The pool was very crowded. We were able to get chairs next to each other 2 days. We didnt stay out very long at a time. The first day a large group of guys was close to us that kept harassing girls as they walked by. The lazy river is a joke, it takes like 2 minutes to get around it, and they charge $23 for a tube, you have to buy it. It is so crowded you get kicked and scratched. The wave pool is pretty lame too, but the kids like it. The Bayside Buffet was not good, we went to Bellagio and their buffet is way better. The server at the buffet completely ignored us, he would stop at all of the tables around us and ask if everything was ok, and I had to literally wave in front of him to ask for a diet Coke. Never saw him again after that either. Overall, TheHotel was TheSuck. ThePeople are really really rude. No one in TheHotel cares about TheGuests.

This was our second stay at THEhotel - our last in 2006 in a middle suite (only a mountain view). The room is looking quite worn - with the bathrooms showing the worse for wear. The caulking is cracked and/or missing, the wall paper is torn and pulling away, the shower head needs to be replaced or given a thorough cleaning (yes, I know the water is hard in Las Vegas, but that just means additional maintenance). The TV's - first generation plasma TV's - have a poor picture (no lines, just low quality) and the audio is shot. In order to listen to the TV at normal level, you must first crank it to 100 and keep increasing the volume until its too loud, then dial back the volume to something less than 100. The result is having it set around the 75-80 range and this will give you some up and down adjustability. However, you have to do this EVERY time you turn on the TV. New plasma 42 inch sets with a better picture are around 1000 dollars each (less if they were to replace them all [approx. 1800 TVs]) so they really need to get off their butt and spend some money. There is also a limited selection of channels. We were there on July 7, 2009 - the day of the Michael Jackson memorial - and 10 out of the 20 channels carried the memorial. That didn't exactly leave much else to watch (a couple sports channels, kids channels). If you buy a beer from the store on the main floor, be sure to buy (or bring) a bottle opener. There is NO bottle opener in the room (something even the cleaning lady for our room laughed about and something I also complained about in the review Mandalay Bay sent after our stay). The temperature outside during our stay was in the mid 40's (C). The temperature in the casino was in the mid teens. Several players at the tables wore jackets or sweaters. The servers were pretty good about brining drinks and making frequent visits. However, if you're looking for some eye candy you'll be disappointed. I'm quite certain I saw a couple servers that were in their 70's. But this seems to be the case in most of the casinos. We made it to Luxor, Excallabur, New York - New York, MGM, Harrah's, Venetian, Mirage and Caesar's during our stay and all were pretty much the same. Internet is available in the room (wired and wireless) but costs $15/day. Yet another thing they ding you for (there's no in room coffee, newspapers, etc.). Come on, in this day this should be included in the $250/nt room fee. One thing I can say on the plus side is that the bed is super comfortable. Easily the best part of the room. Overall, it's still a nice hotel, but it's showing its age and could use some renovation/upgrades.", "Date": "July 14, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Victoria, BC", "Title": "\u201cAn easy escape...Vegetarians take note\u201d", "Author": "Rawb", "ReviewID": "UR34750238", "Content": "I tend to like detail, so that's what you'll get with this review. However, if you don't feel like reading the whole thing, scroll to the bottom for a summary. ***************************************************************************************** First let me state that the purpose of my stay was to catch UFC 100 and the coinciding UFC Fan Expo which were both based at Mandalay Bay. Being cl;ose to these events was my priority and it paid off--I met a ton of fighters and so much time was saved getting back and forth from the events. I have stayed in a few different properties in Las Vegas: NYNY, MGM, Hard Rock. I was scheduled to stay at Mandalay Bay Resort & Casino but when I arrived I was informed I was booked at The Hotel instead. I was a bit disappointed because, though it's rated 4 stars, the reviews on here were mixed. THE ARRIVAL I moved to the lobby of The Hotel and my first impression was positive: You transfer from the hustle and blare of the casino into a cool, marble lined hallway that gets progressively dimmer until you reach the black and cream colored elevator banks that take you to the room-towers. It is very quiet here and you definitely get the feeling of moving into an exclusive, \"members only\" type area. The elevator arrived quickly (as it did every time I used on the whole 5 days I was there--never waiting more than a minute). THE ROOM The room was a suite: A really nice sitting area w/ couch and chair set, a 42 inch flatscreen TV, a desk for work that had an available internet connection ($14.99 per 24 hour period--YIKES!) and your mini-bar that I barely looked at for fear of being charged for its contents! This area also had a separate powder room for guests you might invite in, I suppose. A nice touch. Through a heavy door (all the doors were super heavy for good sound insulation) you reached the bedroom. A large bureau with 2 closets and 2 drawer units for clothes ran along one wall of the room with the beds dominating the other. I found the beds fine and comfortable with high quality linens. The main bathroom is adjacent to the bedroom and it contains a counter with 2 sinks, a HUGE tub for 2, a large, separate shower and a room for the toilet--again, closed off by a very heavy door. The design was sleek and modern but very cosy. My main problems at this point were that housekeeping had obviously been in the room but vacuuming had been missed. There were peanut crumbs all over the bedroom. Also I found that when the room next to mine used their shower, a high pitched squeal ran as long as the water was on. Super annoying. To conclude: The room was lovely and it did feel like a home away from home that I looked forward to returning to every time I hit the quiet, enveloping lobby... THE CASINO The hotel shares the same casino as Mandalay Bay proper. It is the best laid out, easiest to navigate casino I've encountered in all of Las Vegas. Getting to the room was a breeze with limited \"funneling\" you past slots, tables etc. in hopes of eaking out a $ as you crawl to bed. 5 stars from me. DINING Here's where things get tricky for me. I am a vegetarian so Las Vegas is about the worst place on earth for me, food-wise. I tried several different restaurants and was mildly pleased (\"The Cafe\" right outside The Hotel's lobby--roasted eggplant and goat cheese sandwich) to downright disappointed (The Gourmet Burger Bar--horrid, pasty veggie burger) There is a coffee bar RIGHT OUTSIDE the elevators--The location was phenomenal. The coffee itself was just ok, but the convenience was so good... Plus it wasn't Starbucks, which makes me happy. For a quick bite I would use Canter's Deli--which was right next to the exit of The Hotel's lobby, in the sports book. The fries were great. (A drink and fries = $6.50) The best (hands down) meal I had was at \"The Border Grill\". This is a Mexican restaurant right by the beach pool. The prices were reasonable, and the food was amazing. Very complex flavours and a fair number of vegetarian options. The best Mexican food on the strip, I guarantee. I can't recommend this place enough, great staff too. THE POOL The pool was great. As good as the MGM, which I love. I was worried about the \"kid factor\"--(not a kid person)--but it wasn't an issue. I spent most of my time at the wave pool. It was fine. I found a chair every time I went out there even on Saturday (fight day) within moments of arriving. I went down first thing in the morning as well as later in the afternoon to right before lunch--always found a place to sit. If you were trying for 4 together or something it might be a problem but for 2 people, it was easy. THE STAFF Concierge/front desk staff were always very helpful and polite. Most game tables too. Security guard was rude to me when he had to come up and let me into my room due to a key malfunction. Housekeeping were polite but I distinctly told the head of housekeeping that I would like the entire suite to be vacuumed on day 3 and when I returned many of the peanut crumbs were still there. Disappointing. THE LOCATION Not so great if you want to be in the center of the action, which I thought would be a problem but the property has so many amenities I found I didn't want to or need to leave. Also note there is a shop for \"everything\" (Magazines, toiletries, candy, water etc) right by the elevators of The Hotel as well. Very convenient, if a tad pricey. ******************************************************************************************** To sum up: Mandalay Bay is a great casino/resort with a lot of choice under one roof. It is a well-maintained property with helpful staff, and one of the most conveniently laid-out casino floors I've come across. The Hotel at Mandalay Bay is a self-proclaimed 4-star, exclusive minded hotel that lives up to its ambitions. You truly feel like you are getting away from the noise and hustle of the casino when you enter the premises yet they are located so close to the casino that going back and fort to your room is not daunting at all. The rooms are sumptuously appointed with great fixtures and again, a highly relaxing, quiet vibe. My Cons: $$$Expensive$$$ This is one of the pricier hotels I've stayed at on the strip. $15 for a day of internet use is ridiculous. Seriously. In this day and age, where it's comped at even a Motel 6, paying that kind of money for a (near) necessity is truly disappointing. My wife had a shot of Grey Goose Vodka at 2 different bars and one was $12 the other was $13, so that's the kind of booze money you can expect. Sunscreen in the shop in The Hotel was $15 for 350 ml. I sort of felt, at times like they were trying to get every dime they could out of me, you know? Bottom line is, I didn't want to stay here, but the quality, comfort, convenience of this property made me a convert and I would stay here again.

Received an offer and had never stayed at this property. Have stayed at Mandalay Bay which is attached. Went with wife and met friends from LA. Very impressed with everything about the experience at The Hotel. First the check-in was easy compared to most Vegas hotels. Smaller lobby and seperate entrance allowed us to go straight to a host. It probably helped that we checked in around 8pm on Friday night, but still seemed much less of a cattle-call than other hotels we normally stay at (Planet Hollywood, Venetian/Pallazzo and Mirage). The lobby area is cool with lots of marble and dark wood. This is carried out through-out the hotel common areas and then into the rooms. The room was great. A 2-room suite with a seperate living/business area including large flat screen TV and a small powder room. This area included a wet bar and a full couch and chair along with cocktail tables. This area was so accomodating that on Friday night, we had the other couple up to our room for cocktails and room service snacks to catch-up versus going to a noisy bar. It also came in handy several nights when I was not ready too go to bed and wanted to catch-up on SportsCenter and did not have to bother the wife. Priceless bliss for a couple who have been married 20+ years. This usually causes a fight at some time during a trip but no problems! The bedroom was through a door and was well appointed with King bed, another flat screen and a couple of chairs. The furnishings are all dark wook and dark nuetral colors. One of the nicest things was being able to totally \"black out\" the room for sleep. We love to sleep in (especially in Vegas) and it seems like a little thing but we were able to simulate complete darkness. The curtains actually overlap so you can achieve this. Sounds a little crazy, but made the trip even that much better. The main bathroom was great. Two vanities, seperate doored toilet, large tub and stand alone shower. Plenty of room and really nice marble throughout. We had breakfast at The Cafe (everything at The Hotel is generic in nature - The Cafe, The Store, etc.). It was good but pricey at about $18ea. Also ate breakfast one morning at House of Blues with 2-for-1 coupon. It was adequate and cheap. About what you expect for breakfast. The best part of Mandalay and The Hotel is the pool areas. Did not disappoint. Even though crowded, it is a great area with multiple pools, actual sand beach with large wave generator and plenty of places to sun, sit and get your drink on. There is an Adults-only pool which is really quiet and less crowded for an extra charge. We did it one day and it was worth it. the other 3-days we were fine at the other pool areas. Lots of kids and teenagers but lt was fun watching them goof off. Did go for massage at The Spa. the amenities were great and clean. The actual massage room was a little dingy. Good massage but not great. Caught the massuese at the end of the day after 6 other treatments. My fault not hers. Still would not recommend compared to Wynn or Elemis at Planet Hollywood. Very happy with all the staff from valets, wait staff and room attendants. They have some very good people. I had little luck at the casino. Very good environment for Craps. Really good dealers though they kept taking my money. Shopping is really down. The shopping area was lifeless and the stores were not that impressive. Recommend Ceasars or PLanet Hollywood for shopping. We did go over to NY-NY to eat at Gallaghers Steakhouse on a recommendation. Very good and reasonable. Highly recommend if you want a good atmosphere and great caveman steak. Went back another night to try IL Forrino's at NY-NY. It was average but satisfying as Italian goes. Few notes: 1) You are at the south-end of the strip so be prepared for lots of cab rides if you want to go anywhere. The Monorail runs between Mandalay through Luxor to Excaliber but it was not working several days during our trip. 2) Most of the hotels are hurting so ask for upgrades or discounts even at check-in. 3) Was very disappointed in the Mirage. This used to be a favorite and go back everytime at least for dinner. They used to have the best buffet with hot stations and made-to-order. It didnt make you feel bad for eating at a buffet. Not any more. The food quality was poor, service bad and decor breaking down.

I wish I had never used orbitz as I could not change my hotel. We were stuck once we received poor service. We asked reception if our room was a strip view? She said they only had rooms with a pool or mountain view left. So I asked for a V suite upgrade. She said they were all fully booked. So I asked to see this pool view room. The view was a far off view of the pool with a huge view of the airstrip and the noise was loud when I turned off the a/c (hotels turn it on if the room is noisy). So I asked to see the mountain view room. She said I could only see 1 room and that was that! I told her I had flown all the way from England and my entire holiday was The Hotel and that the pool room I was shown was too noisy as it was east facing. She then miraculously said oh there is a strip view V suite if you pay $40 + tax per night. She had lied to me about availability! She then said but it is on the 9th floor so you will not see the strip? I was baffled as why would I pay a supplement for a room with a strip view that now does not have a view? So I asked to see the room to see how much of a strip view if any before I pay an extra $40 + tax. She said no. I had my one look. So I asked to see the manager. I was jet-lagged off 18 hours of travelling to get to LV, was under the weather and here I was in distress over check-in and dealing with a deceitful and most unhelpful receptionist who listened to me straining to speak without any sympathy. The manager appeared to tell me that yes indeed there was a strip view room on the 32nd floor and proceeded to check me in with the extra charge. 30 minutes of standing and not once was I offered a seat for my incredible fatigue and being poorly. Did not sleep a wink. The strip view was in the sitting room and the bedroom faced, you got it, the airport, east facing. So when I can get my eyes open properly, I shall be asking for a west-facing room facing the mountains just to get some sleep on vacation. Never again will I stay at The Hotel! This is the worst reception check-in experience of my life and my husband and I have travelled the world. I would expect any human being to say oh you are sick. Please sit down here and we will sort this out for you. Yes I appreciate you have flown a long way just to stay at our hotel and we would want to do the best to ensure you are happy with us.

My friend lives and works in New York and THEhotel at Mandalay Bay was suggested to him as one of the most exclusive hotels in Vegas. It advertises itself as the boutique style hotel but it is anything but. It's got 1117 rooms for a start. It's huge, impersonal and apart from the large standard room size (actually suites) and some of the decor, there's nothing exclusive about it at all. Nearly all the wedding guests who stayed there reported 20 minute to 40 minute waiting times for check in. The bell boys slouch around and look like you're being a nuisance when you as them to get you a taxi. I left the hotel at 6:30am one day, pressed the special button on the door to let them know that the room could be serviced and when I returned at 3:30pm, it hadn't been. That does not seem like the service one would expect from an exclusive hotel. I went down to the pool area and there was an absolute sea of people. Three of us went down together at 9am but it was so busy that we had to carry loungers around in order to be together. There was an area next to the pool that was quieter with better loungers and so we enquired about it. It cost $100 a day for a lounger and $50 for an umbrella. Being stuck with more than a thousand people squashed together felt more like being at a cheap package hotel than anywhere else. My final comment was about how they treated my friend and his fiance / wife. He had to check out of his room into one of the massive suites they have there for drinks with the guests on the wedding night. He paid $1,300 for this suite. He was told to check out of his standard suite by 11am - which he did. He was then told that the person occupying the large suite he was to move into hadn't checked out and to wait until 1pm. He did this and was then told that he would have to wait until 5pm. He was to get married at 5 and come back to the suite with guests at around 6:30 so this was out of the question. He had told the hotel of his plans when he made the booking and they showed absolutely no can-do or any form of special treatment for his wedding day. After getting quite vocal with them and after being messed around for hours, they finally managed to sort things out and move him into the suite in the early afternoon. It's hardly the way to treat someone on their wedding day, particularly when they have been responsible for bringing around 30 additional bookings to your hotel. I liked the rooms. Apart from the size, the beds were comfortable and there was a good view over the strip and the airport.

Here are the pros and cons (cons are easily avoidable with some inventivness): Pros: 1) Awesome soft beds with PLENTY of pillows, that can satisfy even the pickiest traveler. 2) Two A/C units - one in bedroom, one in living room - so you don't have to listen to your significant other's whining when he/she goes to bed and you still watch the TV 3) 42\" Plasma - YEAH BABY! 4) Leave decent tip to housekeeping and your room will have PLENTY of everything you need - $3/day would do it Cons: 1) Very expensive hotel - you won't find a McDonald or cheaper food places here, a sandwich at Starbucks is $8.50. Just eat elsewhere if you try to save money. 2) DVD player (Philips) Does not play Divx and you cannot plug in the cables to your own DVD players/game system. Live with it. Enjoy Vegas. 3) Mandalay Beach - have to go early and they often don't give more than 1 towel a person. Solution - bring an extra towel and if you can't find a chair, lie on the sand. 4) The only serious flaw - you can hear music from the Mix club in some rooms after 11pm. You'll get used to it after a day or two. Overall - definitely a 5-star. Wonderful quality, total luxury (even bathrobes and sleepers), that's the hotel to stay if you can get a great deal.

Wanting to enjoy the trip to the fullest I decided to go for it and upgraded my flights to business class to make it a real Vegas Experience. The flight from Brussels to Washington by UA went very smooth and staff was great! After boarding the connecting flight to LAS we received notice that there were some issues with some fuelindicators leaving the plane grounded untill repaired. After about 4 hours of waiting the replacement aircraft arrived to take of to LAS. Since I didn't wanted to take a risk I called ahead to THEhotel mentioning that my plane was grounded and that I'll be checking in after midnight. This wasn't a problem and the remarks were noted in the system so that I wouldn't lose my room. After arrival in LAS I took a cab to THEhotel and enjoyed the time talking with the driver. It was a couple of years since being in Vegas but people are still friendly. The entrance of THEhotel is located inside Mandalay Bay or inside the parking space. A bit strange but no problem for me. Due the late arrival there weren't any lines at check-in and a room was issued very quick. I requested a room with some view on the airfield and got a room on the 17th floor from where I could see planes taking off. The room was a pleasant surprise. While some hotels make extremely good pictures and deliver extremely poor rooms THEhotel delivered the room (a suite) just like in the pictures. I was a very nice and spacious room with a large bathroom containing a huge bathtub and a nice shower. I loved it on first sight! The 42\" Philips tv in the living room was actually a bit to big to be enjoyable from the couch. It would be better in the bedroom were you are a bit farther from the tv (which is a regular CRT screen). Also the tv in the bathroom is a nice addition. Small but enjoyable. I spend a lot of time on the desk writing some reports, surfing on the internet (expensive, it would be better if compimentary but faster then many other hotels) or doing some research. It was enjoyable to have a nice desk to work from. Although the bed was very nice and big I actually didn't sleep well in it. I'm used to sleep on a hard bed instead of a soft one and this bed was one of the softest In ever slept in. Enjoyable to relax a bit but I couldn't get any sleep, due this I only slept about 3 hours a night at most. Not the fault of the hotel since probably there aren't to much customers who enjoy a hard bed but it kept me awake ;) One smaller issue is the airconditiong, there are actually 2 units in the room which can probably cool to a freezing point. Although they AC unit could be set on a specific temperature it seemed to cool when it was not necessary, especially during the night. But this could be fixed by turning them off ;) I've ordered a couple of times through roomservice and although not cheap the food was actually very good! Never had an issue that it was allready cold or something, everything was just fine and the portions are huge (at least to European standards). Check out went also very fine, due the fact I was on irregular hours on my room the minibar was never checked upon so I gave them a list with everything I took from the minibar and they thanked me for my honesty (since I didn't leave a credit card they wouldn't be able to charge it afterwards). Lovely and friendly service! After a quick cabride to the airport I could take my flight back home to Belgium. Leaving with a loss of only a couple of hundreds of dollars (far below the max. loss I calculated) I enjoyed myself again to upgrade the flight to business class (IAD-BRU route). After a quick and delicous meal on the plane (I loved the food which was actually good and that something for a man who hated airline food) I slept for several hours and woke up an hour prior to landing in Brussels on Tuesday, June 9, 2009. After collecting my car from the car hotel it was a short ride to home to grab a quick shower and heading to my office to start a new working day. It was a very nice stay at THEhotel and I certainly will stay there again in the future, maybe in one of the more expensive suites.", "Date": "June 15, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "uvalde", "Title": "\u201cThe Hotel at Mandalay Bay\u201d", "Author": "icehouse", "ReviewID": "UR32206328", "Content": "Stayed at the Hotel June 8th-11th.

The mattress was pretty lumpy and worn. We also only had two pillows for a king size bed and both pillows were old and worn. If staying at this hotel you will be sharing the pool area with guest of Mandalay Bay. While the pool area is huge it is not relaxing at all.

What a difference! Upon entering TheHotel you smell these wonderful white flowers, the lights are soft and soothing, and it is very easy to navigate. Pretty much the opposite of MGM, which I think is constructed as a large smoke-filled maze to disorient the drunk people. TheHotel was a much classier experience and much more relaxing. Reaching our suite was quick and easy, and the room was very nice. Our room was very clean, unlike some of the other reviews I have read, so I can't comment on that. I even took a bath in the giant tub after shopping in the Mandalay Place shops and buying a bath bomb -- it was great! My only disappointment was with the pool area. The entire reason I wanted to stay at Mandalay Bay was because the pool looked so fantastic. However, for being such a classy hotel, I was surprised that they had no umbrellas at all, basically forcing you to rent a cabana -- which I couldn't afford. So your only option is to enjoy the pool for as long as you can endure the Vegas sunshine, which isn't very long. I think that this is their way to getting people to leave the pool area so more people can visit. The pool area wasn't as big as I thought it would be and the lawn chairs were just stacked upon each other -- it wasn't a very relaxing experience to be crammed in with everyone else. The one benefit of MGM was the large pool structure -- you didn't feel so crowded there. I am very glad that I did NOT rent a cabana, even though I had a cabana credit -- they were not 1/2 as nice as they looked in the picture. As to location, it wasn't as far away as people have said -- it was about a 10-15 minute walk to get to MGM, and everything else is about a 10-15 minute walk from there. We rented a car which was very helpful, so we could get to wherever we wanted easily. Overall, I would recommend TheHotel if you want a break from the madness that is the rest of the Vegas strip. The casino was very nice and their drink service was top notch -- my friend ordered a jack and coke and they definitely didn't skimp on the jack -- in fact, I think that's all it was! They were also extremely prompt, and apologized if they took more than 10 minutes to get back to you, which is virtually unheard of anywhere else. I'm still not sure how I feel about the pool situation -- I might try staying elsewhere to find a more relaxing pool scene with umbrellas for shade.", "Date": "June 12, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "NYC", "Title": "\u201cTHE Hotel -- a first class place\u201d", "Author": "nycmom1", "ReviewID": "UR31629365", "Content": "We stayed in an upgraded suite overlooking the Strip over Spring Break.

The concierge was helpful, but THE Hotel is huge (as are all the hotels on the Strip). If we ever went back, we would stay in a location that was more mid-strip like the Venetian or the Bellagio, because we were far from everything, although my son LOVED the wave pool... We went to three shows - Tournament of Kings (my son loved it -- it is like WWE!), Lance Burton (my son was called up to stage to hold a birdcage and it disappeared into thin air!), and Beatles LOVE by Cirque de Soleil -- all were amazing. We saw every attraction on the strip -- the volcano erupting at the Mirage, the MGM lions, Sigfried and Roy's Secret Garden (a great place to see dolphins 3 feet in front of you), the Eiffel Tower, the Gondola Ride at the Venetian, the Fountains at the Bellagio. We had the best breakfast in Vegas at the Paris (it really was so much better than the buffet the Mandalay). We ate at BLT Burger for dinner one night, and at Olives at the Bellagio and L'Ami Gabi at the Paris for lunch -- all delicious. We also ate at Fiamma for dinner, which was very snobby and which incredibly would not do pasta with butter and cheese for my son without a big fight. Not very service oriented!!

The robe and slippers were a nice touch. It's just a personal preference but I didn't care for the dark/black wood tones.

I have previously stayed at Mandalay Bay and Hard Rock Hotel - this room was the best of the three. The rooms are VERY spacious, with a separate living room and an extra 1/2 bath. The bathroom was great with a huge tub (large enough for two) and separate shower. The toilet is separated by a door and there is a double vanity and a small flat screen TV in the bathroom (you can watch if you are in the tub). The strip view is great (it was actually better in the room I stayed in Mandalay Bay - I suppose it depends on what room you get). Mandalay pool area is huge, but we did struggle finding two lounge chairs together. We didn't go down early, but were able to catch a couple leaving and took their chairs. There doesn't seem to be many workers at the pool area to help with chairs. You can't order food from the servers at your loungers, but can order drinks. They have a \"take-out\" area for food and also a small restaurant for burgers, etc. in the pool area. There are several restaurants at the Mandalay complex. We ate at the Verandah at the Four Seasons for brunch one day and it was excellent (the Four Seasons is attached to Mandalay). We also tried Red, White and Blue one day and it was good - nothing to rave about, but good. Burger Bar in Mandalay Place is great for burger lovers. The only con would be that the location is on the South Strip (which might be a pro for some). I have stayed here before and would love to stay mid-strip sometime for the convenience.

My brothers room was not ready however mine was so he left his and luggage in my room and we were able to go walk the strip, gamble etc until his was ready. Now for inconveinece number one. The front desk clerk told him his room would be right down the hall and he would notify cleaning staff and it would be ready within a hour and a half. They told him they would call him on his cell phone. This was at 10:30 am or so the first day. We went and walked around etc and by 2pm stil no phone call so we stopped by the desk and were told he shouldnt have told us a time and his room still was not ready. They finally called close to 3 pm. If we had not had another room this would have been a major inconvenience. If the room is not ready til 3 when check in time is then dont tell people that it will be its as simple as that. We got his room finally and everything after that, food, cleaning service etc was great. Until the last night that is. My brother went back to his room toward dinner time and the card wouldnt open the door, he then went to the front desk who told him the problem was fixed and gave him new cards for the door. Those didnt work either. We had to wait for security who could not open the door and then engineering who had to put a new lock on all the time while we waited. So after that two hour process from desk to fixture being replaced we were not happy as we missed the last night having dinner with our friends. After this incident we went to the front desk and not only did they comp his last night but mine as well due to us both missing dinner and also gave us a large food credit for the restaurants. Overall I would highly recommend this hotel. The service was great and to be fair since they compensated the both of us for the lock mishap when it wasnt even my room I would have to say I cant complain too much.

We rented a car during our stay and valet parking was efficient and the valets were extremely helpful with directions. This hotel is a quiet, elegant alternative to many of the other busy strip hotels, yet we were just steps away from the Mandalay Bay casino and many shops, bars and restaurants. We had dinner our first night at the China Grill and loved it! We enjoyed great food and service. The Mandalay Bay casino is busy but not super packed because of the way it is laid out. It also seems a bit classier than some of the casinos we walked through during our stay. It was also not as smoke-filled. The Mandalay Beach area with all the different pools was really great. Pool chairs can be hard to come by at the peak time of day, but we got there early enough that this wasn't a problem. There are a number of cabanas available to rent for those who don't want to deal with finding pool chairs.

It's on the back side of Mandalay Bay, but is far superior as almost every room is a 2 room suite. Each suite has a doorbell, 2 bathrooms, 3 tvs, a roman tub and separate shower. This hotel room oozes luxury! They have their own soap/shampoo line that my wife couldn't believe and loved! It's location is its only hang-up. It's the last major hotel on the south side of the strip, so whenever you want to go out exploring, it'll either be a long walk or a short cab ride. The big plus side of it's location is that the casino is never packed to the point where you can't get on any of the tables, etc. It is a busy casino, but the center strip hotels' casinos are packed as the many gamblers gravitate to these hotels at night. The lobby is a bit foreboding, and some could consider it being cold, as its high marble/granite walls and in black or white and are constantly being polished. Every day, a girl would be filling 1-2 meter high vases with new flowers all over the lobby, usually lillys...very nice! TIP- If you happen to be travelling with others, ask that your rooms are in the same section ~ they have 2 elevators, one for the lower rooms, the other the upper rooms, so you could find yourselves going down to the lobby only to take the other elevator to go up to your friends' room. Vegas can be as busy or as relaxing as you want it. The pool section is located at Mandalay Bay and is HUGE! I can't imagine it filling up in the summer sun! THE Hotel has it's own cafe, very pricy, its own bar (not too bad!), and a coffee/muffin/pastry shop, so we mostly went into Mandalay where they had a miriade of restaurants to choose from. Don't like those? Take the walkway to the Luxor...more shops and restaurants! TIP - need beer/drinks? THE Hotel has a gift shop with all of these items if you can't wait; we found getting the cab driver to pull over to an off-strip mini-mart would save almost $8/18pack of beer! There is a fitness center and wireless internet, both of which you have to pay for ($20/day for fitness, $15/day for internet), a downside if you want/need either. TIP- After 11pm on off days (Sun-Wed), VIP Reps are soliciting people on the casino floor to come to their exlusive bars in the hotel at little or no cover charge! We got in to 40 duece, the House of Blues Foundation Room and Mix, all because we were in dressy clothes and it was an off night after 11pm! Overall, I would recommend THE Hotel to anyone who likes the business of Vegas, but also likes a quiet refuge between being busy! You're able to recharge as the room is dead quiet, and I rarely heard anyone in the hall. The service is premium, the concierge is knowledgable and can get any ticket you want/need.

First, Mandalay Bay is too far down the strip. The tram was broken the week we were there. We ended up renting a car for the last two days, so we could get around more quickly. I will stay in the Center Strip next time (probably at the Paris Hotel, which has much cheaper restaurants and light colored decor and a central location). TheHotel was lovely and elegant, but VERY dark! Even with all the lights on, the room was dim, and all of the colors were muted and depressing. The walls in the lobby were black - sleek, but dark. It was so dark in The Coffee Shop I couldn't read the labels for the milk (1% whole, half & half?). The flowers in the lobby (Calla lilies) and black and white artwork simply added to this morbid effect. The Hotel was very expensive. I got a good deal on the room rate (179/129) but a $14.99/ day fee for Internet is ridiculous. It was $12 for a drink at the Beach. We ate at the Coffee Shop, to grab breakfast to go - banana, croissant, and tea cost $12, and the Beach Cafe - $40 for 2 hotdogs that were bland, french fries, and 2 drinks. All of the staff I came into contact with were gracious and welcoming. The front desk staff spoke at the speed of light. I didn't have too much trouble understanding them (being from the East Coast, I guess!) but my mother-in-law couldn't understand a word any of them said. We couldn't figure out how to change the clock in our room for daylight savings time. We unplugged it, because it was so bright, and the maids plugged it back in. They also wouldn't leave stuff like the tissue box and extra pillows, where we put them. There was no coffee/teapot in the room. The mini-bar was well-stocked and typically priced. The bathroom and amenities gorgeous, but there was no fan to clean the air or dull bathroom sounds. The walls were not very thick. People in the hall and people flushing the door toilet next door woke up up every night. The view was nice but at 3AM I could hear dumpsters and sirens, 24 stories down. There was a long wait for the elevator (only 3 of the 5 were operational. The beds were comfortable, but the linens were so starchy and scratchy I had to cover my pillow with my bathrobe. Everything was pretty clean, but our towels were getting threadbare and had black marks on them. I had to call for new ones that were also stained. It was a REALLY long walk to the pool, which is shared with Mandalay Bay. We were so looking forward to the pool! It was a primary reason for selecting TheHotel and it was a bit chilly to fully enjoy. There were no changing rooms or lockers. There was a fee for tube rentals.

Loved the sports book. Very spacious and group friendly.

I give the hotel, service, casino, and spa the full five stars, but the location is a big downside. You are at the extreme south end of the strip.

THE SUITE The 2 room corner suite on the 38th floor was huge and very nicely furnished in muted earth tones and yes, somewhat dim lighting - but adequate for my needs. Enjoyed the 2 46 inch LCD tvs - one in living and one in bedroom. This is a true suite - not one big room that has a partition in the middle to separate sitting from bed area (i.e. Venetien/Palazzo & Encore). There is a large bath with walk in shower and separate soaking tub with a separate water closet. Then, there is a 1/2 bath in the hallway near the entry door. My only complaints about the suite is that the windows were not clean and I didn't care for the gold tone of the windows - which is obvious when you view the hotel from the exterior and makes for a cloudy appearance in looking out. THE HOTEL THEhotel is attached to Mandalay Bay by a short hallway. The casino was a 1 minute walk from the elevators. Had access to all the restaurants and shops at Mandalay Bay. My real complaint about my stay was that I felt isolated from the Strip. Being on the far south end of the Strip, it wasn't easy to get to many other properties by walking. If you want to see a show at Ceasars/Bellagio area, you really need to take a cab. My other real complaint is that there was no ABC or drug store nearby that allowed guests to get food/drinks for reasonable prices. The prices within the hotel complex were outrageous (as they all are), but with Wynn/Ceasars/Bellagio, you have options nearby to pick up things and take back to the hotel. I didn't find anything nearby THEhotel. One problem may be that there is really no front entry to this property - it's within a parking garage. You can walk way over to the front of Mandalay Bay and be nearer the Strip, but that's seemed like a long way and not convenient. To give you an idea of the prices....you can choose from 4 or 5 flavors of ice cream on the room service menu - $13.75 for a pint (with taxes and fees)!!! And the wait was 45 minutes for room service delivery at 7pm on a Sunday night. SERVICE I thought the overall service was okay, but spotty. Ate several meals in The Cafe as I was staying on Amex Fine Hotels program rate which gave me 4 $20 meal vouchers to be used at that restaurant (or The Coffee Bar) at any time during their open hours - 7am to 3pm. That allowed for 2 breakfasts and 2 lunches with minimal amounts over the $20 limit for a nice meal. The food was good, but not great. Service was excellent at times and definitely not at others. SPA The Bathhouse Spa continues the trendy feel of the THEhotel. It's smallish with standard whirlpool, saunas and showers. The service in the locker area was not that attentive. What made up for this experience was the massage. Randy was outstanding and I highly recommend him to anyone wanting a firm swedish or deep tissue massage. Overall, the Spa was fine but nothing special (except for the therapist). If you are looking for the wow factor of Qua at Ceasers or Spa at Encore, you won't find it here, but you can have a very good massage if you are more focused on the treatment than the asthetics of the spa itself. OVERALL I would stay here again, but wouldn't rush back. I prefer the more central Stip location of Wynn/Encore over this south strip location. I didn't mind the airport noise and actually enjoyed watching the planes take off and land. You get a great room and a full casino. If it were the summer months, my opinion may change with the beach/pool area at Mandalay, which I didn't use in February.

The casino was huge with a good choice of games, the buffet was excellent with lovely food and a great choice. The hotel has a shark reef aquarium within it which was brilliant. It also had a walkway which linked it to the Luxor and then to the Excalibur which made it easy to get around as we were worried before we went due to the hotel being at the end of the strip.

It's great to have a nice room to go to after a long day in Vegas. The only negative I can think of (and it's small) is the room is a little dark, but it's no big deal! There was no wait for check in or check out. I have stayed at Bellagio, Venetian & Wynn and The Hotel has as good a room as any of them. The casino/resort is another story. The Hotel is attached to Mandalay and does not have it's own casino, which is fine. But Mandalay/The Hotel is on the end of the Strip and the location is not very good for walking to other \"high end\" casinos. Because of this the casino does not get as much action and good vibe. The casino at the other high end hotels is better in my opinion. But it was a perfect location for me because I was working at the MBCC. Stripsteak at Mandalay has great food and drinks, but not cheap. For breakfast I recommend just grabbing something at the lobby cafe at The Hotel. It's quick and easy.

The previous reviews that said the bathrooms were huge are completely accurate - it was certainly roomy.

The floors of the bathroom weren't the cleanest - the same strands of hair were there the first two days, but on day 3 they were finally cleared up. I was very, very happy with the room until... ....the second evening of our stay. The music coming from the hotel club (I'm assuming it was 'Mix') was so bloody loud that I could tell what songs were playing. (We were on the 15th floor.) I could also hear every word being said by the people in the room next to us - they were in the sitting area of their suite, which is next to the bedroom in our suite. I popped some sleeping pills and conked out. Next morning our friends who had a suite on the 32nd floor said they could hear the music also, so I didn't ask for a new room since it didn't seem to matter what floor you're on. If the music is loud enough to hear in the rooms, I shudder to think of how loud it is in the club. Are their ears bleeding by the end of the night? The staff was very polite and we had no complaints. Bell desk was also wonderful in helping with our lost luggage. The hotel bar had a deal on wine, so it was very crowded when we went there for a pre-dinner drink. The bartender could learn a bit more about wine, and the poor solitary server could use some help.

THE Suites are superb! We seriously considered the Venetian, The Bellagio and Mandalay Bay, all of which seem equally attractive and are similarly priced but THE Hotel proved to be a truly terrific choice, which easily exceeded our expectations! We don\u2019t subscribe to the popular theory that a hotel is just somewhere to lay your head. It\u2019s a fundamental factor in any good vacation, especially in Vegas where you\u2019ll need a retreat from the heat (or cold) and the frantic action. THE Suite provided us with a welcome bolthole to escape the hustle and bustle & find some Q/T in LV to enjoy our 20th wedding anniversary! Check in was instant and effortless. Our suite was enormous and extremely well equipped with a breath taking of THE Strip! Floor to ceiling windows maximise the stunning vista in both the bedroom and living area and there are massive flat screen TV\u2019s in each, with a smaller set in the enormous, exquisite bathroom. We thoroughly enjoyed the wealth of space throughout our five-day stay! The marble wet bar in the living room was an excellent embellishment as it enabled us to concoct our own cocktails and night caps which radically reduced our bar bill. Drinks are expensive in LV. Prices up-scale establishments can border on outrageous so BYO if you can! THE Store in the lobby sells a wide range of beer, wine and spirits more reasonably priced than the in room mini bar and there\u2019s also a coupla liquor stores opposite the Mandalay Bay but their prices are not that much less so it\u2019s not really worth the trek unless your buying plenty! The bedroom was spacious and stylish with ample storage that comprises two dressers, an elegant TV bureau incorporating the complimentary in room safe flanked by two wardrobes with interior lights, all of which boast mirror panelled doors which elegantly enhance the room\u2019s ambiance! The bed was divine! Well dressed with plenty of pillows \u2013 difficult to get out of! THE bathroom was the un-disputed star of the show \u2013 double marble vanity, deep roman tub, separate glass enclosed shower, snug robes and as previously mentioned, a wall mounted flat screen TV! Entirely enjoyable! THE Hotel is attached to but very distinct from the Mandalay Bay. It is distinguished by it\u2019s sleek black marble d\u00e9cor, it\u2019s cool chic, yet laid back atmosphere and even it\u2019s very definite vanilla aroma, all of which become immediately apparent the moment you cross it\u2019s threshold via a short walk way from the MB Casino. The hotels location is not as remote as some suggest because the Strip itself is not as disperse as you might think. The MB, Luxor, Excalibur, NYNY and the Monte Carlo are all adjacent to one another and the MC is pretty much centre strip, opposite the MGM. It\u2019s and easy walk. The tram takes 10 minutes and they run constantly. Taxis to centre strip cost $10. To the north strip costs $20 and they\u2019ll give you the option to take the fast route via the parallel freeway avoiding the terrible traffic. We gorged at the buffet twice, once for dinner, once for brunch. Both meals were excellent and reasonably priced, $16 and $26 respectively but it\u2019s not worth the extra few bucks for the \u201cChampagne Brunch\u201d as the only addition is a couple of glasses of cava. We also had room service twice, once for breakfast and once for dinner. Service was prompt and attentive. The food was good and the price was nice! We didn\u2019t try the Spa and the pool was closed for winter so we can\u2019t comment except to say that they looked great. We enjoyed the MB casino which seem quieter than most. The slots were quite loose and we won on the video roulette, which is my personal favourite. We also spent an evening in the House of Blues Foundation Room at the top of MB, which boasts a splendid strip view. Every staff member we encountered was friendly and efficient. Housekeeping was brilliant and we tipped them handsomely. When we queried a $62 mini bar charge they removed it instantly without asking for any explanation. (We had removed a couple of bottles to chill our own stuff and forgot to replace them until the following evening). We had a truly terrific time at THE Hotel so we\u2019d highly recommend it and we\u2019d most definitely return, perhaps when the weather is warmer and the out pool/beach complex is open.

My girlfriend in tow, who had never been, I wanted to make this truly a great experience all around. I'm one of those people who typically scours sites like TripAdvisor relentlessly, looking for the perfect place. However, there does come a point where you have to realize there is no hotel out there that has a perfect track record of not getting you robbed, treated poorly, financially betrayed or otherwise. Despite numerous reviews on THEHotel that described those things, I took the plunge and booked on Travelocity. $130 a night for three nights, with a $75 discount on the third night for booking with a mastercard. At the time of booking, I felt pretty good considering that a steal. I was not wrong. Cab fare to and from THEHotel/the airport was $15 and about ten minutes of travel time. You enter from an underground parking facility that may seem cold, but is a forgettable prelude to the experience of actually walking into the lobby. The main entryway is dynamic, and sets the tone for the rest of the hotel. As previous reviews describe, this is not a casino hotel. This is a seperate experience. Very, very quiet, subdued, modern, and service oriented. There are hotel employees all around waiting to assist you. I checked in at 3:45pm with no wait. I politely asked the desk attendant for a room on a high floor if possible. He said he had something for me. On arrival to the room, I realized he did indeed. On the 31st floor, with floor to celing windows featuring a panoramic view of the southern end of the Las Vegas strip, predominately featuring Luxor with the City Center construction and Excalibur in the distance and MGM Grand to the right. I was admittedly bewildered that I got this good of a view for the travelocity theft-price that I paid. The rooms are pretty spectacular. The pictures on here give you an excellent indicator of the size, design and quality of the rooms. The only complaints I could come up with were some odd volume control issues with the main TV, and an IPOD clock that would not show the correct time. Also, unfortunately, THEHotel suffers from a very bad case of thin wall syndrome. You will be able to hear, word for word, what's going on in your neighbor's lives, unfortunately. Other that those issues, absolutely no problems. Incredibly comfortable beds, amazing bathrooms (yes, plural), great sofa. Location wise, previous reviewers are quick to point out that THEhotel is somewhat painfully located on the extreme south end of the strip. The free tram from Mandalay to Excalibur makes arrival at the tropicana intersection quick and painless, but anything north of that is admittedly a bit of a trek (about 15 minutes up to Bellagio). In retrospect, I probably would of paid to get a Monorail pass so I could board at MGM and move up the strip quicker, but it could of been worse. Mandalay, as a resort property all together, is very nice. I can't comment on the dining, as we admittedly ate at several other casinos and restaurants instead during our trip, but we did splurge on room service for breakfast our first morning. The food was good, and the service prompt and friendly. In regards to in-room internet, I have the standard complaint that if Motel 6 can provide free wi-fi in this day in age, THEHotel at Mandalay Bay can provide free wi-fi. Alas, it's $13.99 a day. On checkout, I noticed I had two problems with my bill. A minibar charge without merit, and an internet access charge for one day that went on a seperate credit card when I bought it, and shouldn't of been billed to the room. When I brought both of these issues up at checkout, both charges were immediately removed without any question or hesitation whatsoever. The baggage staff efficiently and safely stored our bags for a few hours as our plane wasn't leaving until later that evening. As we left, we were genuinely welcomed to return soon by the baggage staff. I'm typically a traveler of variety, and rarely like to stay at the same property more than once. Las Vegas is certainly a destination that offers some of the most variety available anywhere in the world in terms of accomodations. That being said, i'll be returning to THEHotel later this year for a longer stay.

Two friends had independently told me how cool this place was, and how much I would enjoy the cosmopolitan feel of the rooms. So I thought I would give it a try. Indeed, I was really looking forward to the 4 nights there! On arrival, there were only 2 people at the reception desk, and there was a lineup. We had booked THESuite through the hotel website, and had bought the Exotic Escapes package that included a $300 coupon for Mandalay Place, half-price tickets for Mamma Mia and some return airfare voucher. If you buy this package, know that the $300 DOES NOT cover spa treatments (I foolishly did not read the fine print...). Second, the spa had been advertising a deal in the elevators whereby if you came in for 2 spa treatments on the same day, the second, lesser-priced treatment was half-priced (at check-out, the front-desk person told me that that wasn't part of the package...). Turns out that the half-price deal on Mamma Mia tickets ended December 21 (we arrived December 26) and I never saw anything about any return airfare voucher. The suite was nicely furnished although there was no chair for the desk (you probably shouldn't be working anyways...), and a sconce was \"out\" in the bathroom. During our time there, a desk chair never appeared and the bulb for the sconce was not replaced. The two little square coffee tables in the living area had looked as if they had seen better days and oddly, there was no coffeemaker in the room.

The connected XBOX 360 and our video camera and cell phones were not taken. They did not even take the power cord or AV cords for the player, but simply unplugged them. I believe the thief thought it was a notebook computer as it was thin and hence could be placed inside a jacket and easily hidden. Hotel security took our data and when asked how the thief had gained access to a locked room, he stated that perhaps the door didn't lock and a \"door pusher\" came along during that time and stole our item. When we spoke with the manager immediately after the event, she seemed indifferent. (We did file a report with the local police department as we wanted to be sure this would be on record somewhere.) The hotel, of course, is not responsible and thus has zero incentive to find out what actually happened. We were told by hotel security that no hotel employee had accessed our room while we were gone. I personally tested the door a dozen times or so, once as we left with the security guard. It locked everytime. I teach physics at a local college and find it difficult to believe that this expensive system happened not to function this one time. My best guess involves the floor manager, who rang our doorbell about 9:30 to ask if we needed room service. While I was talking to him I believe he placed some tape over the lock on the door frame so it would close but not lock. My son stated that he seemed quite interested in what he was doing on the desk as I was talking with him. I just wanted him to leave so we could get ready to go down for breakfast at Starbucks. Then, when we were gone he could enter our room, take any interesting items, remove the tape and clean if needed, all without any record of the room having been entered. This is the only possiblity I can think of as I am sure the door had \"locked\". The hotel informs me that it is our responsibililty to keep all valuables in the room safe. Noted, but it is a pain quite honestly and we figured it should be safe in the locked room with limited (and recorded) access. We have used this DVD player and XBOX like this for the past 5.5 years in Cancun, India, and all over the U.S. including Orlando and have never had a problem. Guess we have been lucky and we learned a hard lesson. Perhaps this may help you avoid a similar situation. In sum, I must say that I believe the Hotel system has it sweet right now. They have no responsiblity whatsoever unless you leave the items with them at the front desk, if you care to do that.

It's a beautiful hotel and the suites are absolutely lovely. We also had a great view from our room. The pros: Staff were friendly and polite and the service was good. Note that if you're a VIP guest, you may be able to get a late checkout for free. It's also extremely easy to get to the Luxor and the Excalibur from THEhotel as they're all connected. The Player's card is under the MGM brand, which means you can gamble at a number of different casinos and still collect points for it. Things to consider (I wouldn't really call them 'cons'): One thing to bear in mind when staying at this hotel -- it's located right at the south end of the strip, so getting to other hotels near the north end of the strip can be a bit of a pain if you're planning to take the bus. Vegas traffic (and the fact that the bus stops at almost every hotel along the strip) means that it can take maybe about 45 minutes to get from THEhotel to the Stratosphere or Circus Circus. If you're planning to cab though, then it won't be much of an issue -- the cab ride will be quick since you don't make stops in between. You could also ask the cabs to go by the back roads instead of going down the strip, which will speed up your trip a lot since you won't have to deal with strip traffic. Also, because of its location, THEhotel is a bit quieter than the hotels located in the middle of the strip, which may be either a good or bad thing, depending on the kind of experience you're looking for. We didn't find the food around THEhotel great. We tried the breakfast buffet at Mandalay Bay, which was pretty disappointing. Also ate at Mix, which is on the top floor of THEhotel -- were rather underwhelmed by that too.

When we got to the counter, we had to be transferred to Mandalay Bay because the power had been out in the hotel and the room \u201chad issues\u201d. However, we received a $150 food credit on our room for the inconvience. Most guests were receiving a refund for the room night, but because we purchased through a tour operator they could not refund us directly. We were fine with this offer, which worked out to $50 per person staying in the room. The front desk agent noted we could use the credit at any of their properties and named all hotels under their ownership. They then offered to call us the next morning and have us transferred back to TheHotel where the front desk agent further noted the rooms were much nicer. He was very friendly and apologized for the inconvenience. By noon the next day we had not heard from TheHotel so called down to the Mandalay Bay to check on the situation and have a bellman move our bags back to the other property. They noted a room was available and would send the bellman up in 5 minutes. 20 minutes later there was no sign if anyone so we hauled our bags back over to The Hotel and re checked in ourselves. The rooms are very nice and the bathrooms are amazing. We were out of the hotel until 11pm and upon our return a message was waiting for us to call the front desk. The agent advised us we would have to move from floor 24 to 23 due to work being done as a result of the storm and they would be required to turn off the hot water. The agent advised a bellman would be sent up in 5 minutes. 20 minutes later I called back down and spoke to the same agent (with a very distinctive voice) but she did not recall our conversation, but would send someone right up as we just wanted to go to bed. As she was advising me of this, two strangers entered our room. Since they had checked us out of our room to move, in the mean time they had re checked in a new couple to our room and issued them keys. Odd since we were told we had to move due to no hot water and loud construction. All I can say is I am glad we were dressed. The poor couple was very embarrassed and we asked for another $150 credit for this mix-up and inconvenience which was immediately granted. The bellman showed up minutes later and all he could say was \u201coops\u201d. No apology, just bad jokes. He kept looking in our shopping bags and asking us about our purchases all the way to the new room. We were fairly frustrated at this point and did not tip the bellman for the move. He made it very clear he was not happy about this and mumbled \u201ccrap this\u201d under his breath as he left the room. The new room was exactly the same as the last, but no longer had the strip view. On the 4th day of our stay we asked for a late checkout which was granted and left the room at 1230 to checkout. We wanted to use the remaining credit for lunch, but was told we had to use it before we checked out and vouchers were not an option. We had to be out of the room by 1pm, so we decided to go over to the buffet and bill lunch to the room and then call back over to checkout. The front desk printed a copy of our bill which noted our Bellagio buffet purchase would not be covered as he insisted the credit could only be used at the Mandalay Bay restaurants. As this was not what we were told upon receiving the credit we insisted it be covered. After the agent spent 10 minutes speaking with his manager, he returned agreeing to pay the cost with our credit, plus a whole new, not so friendly attitude towards us.", "Date": "December 27, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Milwaukee, Wisconsin", "Title": "\u201cPerfect hideaway on Halloween weekend\u201d", "Author": "tosatravelbug", "ReviewID": "UR22941540", "Content": "We chose THEhotel as our home base for our first trip to Las Vegas, on Halloween weekend. We had a great time and would definitely stay here again. WHAT WE LIKED: Decor (both in lobby/common areas and suite), background music, the hotel's aromatherapy scent (we usually hate fragrances applied on a room- or building-wide level but found this to be lovely and soothing), view from our suite (best on floors 30+), our bathroom (giant soaking tub for 2), the beach/pools, the variety of restaurants in the complex, and the relative quietness of the property compared to other hotel/casino complexes. WHAT WE WEREN'T CRAZY ABOUT: Holy Crap! The prices at MIX were ridiculous. We thought for those prices it should have been one of the best meals of our lives, but it wasn't. The service was top-notch, the decor and view were spectacular, and the food was excellent - but not stellar, if you're a reasonably well traveled fan of food. Also, I'm pretty sure my second cocktail was completely devoid of vodka, which at $18 each (heck, at any price), it should not be. BE AWARE: As many reviews have noted, THEhotel is at the far south end of the Strip. If you need to get to the far north end of the Strip during rush hour or on the weekend, give yourself ample time for the Deuce, a taxi, or the monorail.

The hotel and casino looked fairly empty. The checkin staff was not overtly rude nor above par. Average. Upon entering the \"updated suite\", it was clear the carpet in the main room had not been vaccuumed. A piece of pizza crust in the corner off the tiled entry door. There were some debris of sorts fronting the couch. Particles of hair remained on the bathroom floor. This was not intolerable to me as my wife was not traveling with me. Maid service arrived at about noon and took care of the issue. I heard it snowed the day prior. This may or may not have triggered the subtle flickering of lights in my room as I took care of business on the internet. The next day, this on and off flickering continued till about 10 am. Then the electricity completely went out. No employee I encountered knew why. I left the hotel for the day to attend business appointments. Never mind that some of my work on my laptop was lost due to the sudden outage. I'm sure THEhotel did not induce this power failure to test my patience. I returned about 5:00 pm. The power outage had not been corrected. They were telling everyone, \"It would not be resolved tonight.\" Employees were kind enough to give out glow sticks that proved futile if you needed to pack things in the dark. Everyone booked at THEhotel were being re-booked to the Mandalay. The front desk informed me I had a regular deluxe room. Never mind I am paying good fare for a suite. After explaining this to the front desk, she tells me she'll give me the regular room for a discount of $99. Really???!!! I was also charged $13.99 for internet access per day which she agreed to remove the charge for that day. Thank you very much. If this is the manner that THEhotel takes care of their guests, I will go elsewhere. And I did. The Bellagio took me in. That night, I decided to play and check other casinos. Only THEhotel was experiencing this power outage. Sadly, if they'd not given the impression they cared only about taking your money, I'd have gladly given them my business as well as booking employees for future stays. Not now. This was my first stay at THEhotel thinking it would be a nice change of pace. That, it surely was. It has not proven to be anything substantially above average. I'd like to stress that no one at THEhotel was overtly rude. It's just not anything to sing about. The Bellagio, Venitian, Palazzo or the Wynn are still the places to look towards if you are aiming for a certain caliber of class. The Signature and Four Seasons are other venues if you are looking for a non-gaming place to stay.

I visit Vegas 3-4 times per year on average, and I usually now stay at the Palazzo. But I stayed here because it was the site of the conference I was attending. First the good: the room was fairly newly renovated, nice decor, good size, good bathroom. It was clean with the exception of a conspicuous red stain on the carpet. Now the problems. Upon arrival, I was given a room initially that was half-cleaned and serviced. The beds appeared made, but there was garbage as well as used towels scattered in the room and bathroom. That was a first for me. Contacted the front desk, and I had to go down, stand in line, and have them re-check me into a different room. A true luxury hotel, which this is not, would have sent someone to move me to a new room to avoid the trek back to the front desk and subsequent second wait. They did give me a $100 food and bev credit for my trouble, which was a good touch. The new room I was moved to was fine. The bed was a little soft for my tastes, but the big problem was the worst pillows ever in a hotel bed. Really soft, flat down pillows. Two of them stacked did not help. Two others at the conference with me agreed that this was the case in their rooms as well. After one sleepless night, I called to request a firmer foam pillow. It took multiple calls and a one hour wait until someone delivered one to me. Fireworks testing and subsequently the real deal starting at 5:40 am one morning right in front of the hotel for the LV marathon was a little inconsiderate. I don't expect the highest level of accomodations or service in Vegas, due to the nature of the Vegas tourism business, but there are some standards, and in the four star category, I would rate Mandalay the lowest I've encountered. The Palazzo and the Venetian are approximately the same price or just a little more, and both are far superior to this. Bellagio and Wynn are of course superior to this hotel, but more expensive. In the same price range or less than Mandalay, but better than Mandalay are Caesar's, Mirage, Treasure Island.", "Date": "December 8, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Phoenix", "Title": "\u201cWe love TheHotel!\u201d", "Author": "TraceyPhoenix", "ReviewID": "UR22450726", "Content": "We recently stayed three nights at TheHotel at Mandalay Bay and loved it.

We both booked V suites and asked for as high a floor as possible. Upon checking in, we were offered floor 17: one with strip view and one with pool view. We did ask if we waited longer, if any higher floors would become available and even asked about the H suite and what cost for upgrading. Unfortunately, there were none available so we stayed put. As it was a V suite, they were at the end of the corridor, either side of the express Mix lift which when looking out the windows at night, gave us quite a scare when it zipped past quickly. The rooms were very spacious, with plenty of room to spread out. The bathroom was also roomy with many toiletries supplied (although don't try the dental elixir it's awful). Lying in bed, we could see the whole of Mandalay Bay and watch the planes taking off. My niece (who had the strip view) found it difficult seeing past the Luxor as floor 17 appeared to be smack bang in the middle of that building so obviously difficult to see around. The only downfall of the room was the lack of hanging space. Due to the safe being on top of the drawers in the closet, it meant only extremely short clothes could be hung up on the one side. On the other side where longer clothes could be hung, the ironing board took up most of the space. If any more than two people were staying in the suite for a long time, this could really be an issue of cramming stuff into the closet or not fully unpacking. We didn't receive bathrobes as promised for our stay on arrival, but after leave a tip for the made and leaving a note, these arrived, along with thong type slippers which we found very useful. The beds were very comfortable and we slept well with no disturbances from other guests. We never had any problems with cleaning and the maid service was fine. We never had turn down at this hotel but it maybe that this hotel just doesn't do it unlike the Bellagio and Venezia tower. As my niece had not been to Vegas before, we walked a lot along the strip and found the tram direct to Excalibur an absolute must. It really helps when you're this far up the strip. Overall, a great stay, we absolutely loved the tranquility of The Hotel against the hustle and bustle of Mandalay Bay.

(NOTE if you are calling housekeeping, be sure to turn your don not disturb sign off and the housekeeping one ON.) Once kids were in bed, I organized our snack area. In the living room they do provide a \"wet bar\" with 2 regular glasses, 2 wine glasses, an ice bucket, and a tray of \"snacks\".... expensive snacks. we filled our ice bucket and used it to keep beverages cold (we brought a small container of milk that stayed cold and was a nice treat for breakfast.) Bedroom & Living room areas featured floor to ceiling windows, dimming lights and blackout curtains. Each morning, the kids enjoyed the enormous bath along with their favorite PBS or NICK friends (tv in the bath, as well as a phone and digital scale). bath samples included body balm, shampoo, cond, bath salts, shoe polish, shower cap, mending kit, bath soap and hand soap. The extra half bath was a plus. Dining: Never ate at THE Hotel. Luxor food court (accessible by following the Mandalay Place walkway and turning L towards Starbucks... we had McDonald's there. There is also several others Nathan's Hot Dogs, and a smoothie place I believe) Excalibur buffet was average. Carving Station, Mexican, Asian, Fruits, Desserts, Salad.

I have to say that this is one of the best hotels I have stayed at, everything from Check-in to Check-out was excellent. I arrived at check in, on a Saturday afternoon and was greeted with a nice smell of a sweet fragrance that seemed to fill the whole of the lobby. I gave my details to the receptionist who went away and checked that the room was clean and ready to use, after a few minutes he came back to confirm all was ok. very smooth, Room was on the ninth floor and was a corner suite. key worked first time (it can be annoying when you are some many floors up and the key hasn't been activated). Opened the door to be plesantly surprised by the size of the room. Our room contained a separate lounge and bedroom with a good size bathroom. The views were brilliant as from the bedroom you could see various hotels on the strip and the mountains from the other and the lounge had a view of the airport and the Mandalay bay. The maids came in and cleaned the room every day, left fresh towels daily and maids always greeted you everytime you passed them in the corridors. The hotel doesn't have a casino linked to the hotel but a short walk through to the Mandalay bay and there is all the gambling tables and sports books you need. The Hotel is located at the end of the strip next to the Mandalay Bay and the luxor, it can be a bit of walk down to the strip but it was nice to see a little sunlight and walk off the breakfast belly. you can also get a tram from the Mandalay bay down to the strip. If you stay at this hotel, you need to take a vist to the mix lounge on the 64th floor. The views are amazing and worth the extra few dollars on the drinks. All in all I would recommend this hotel to anyone as I was in las vegas for a friends wedding and there was about 10 people that stayed in the hotel and no-one could find any complaints.

The view was amazing and the twin rooms were two kingsized beds anyway so it did not really matter that we were not allocated our requested room type. The hotel was very modern, the rooms were amazing and the hotel ameneties were great too. There were so many restaurants and bars to choose from...almost too much choice!!

If you go there ask for a window seat, the views are amazing. the restaurant also has a club so keep your food receipt and you dont have to pay to get in. The hotel had a great swimming pool (was voted the best in Vegas in 2006) it has a lazy river & wave pool. Great for all but not so fun on a weekend as it is packed and you will struggle to get a sun lounger. There is an adult only pool but this you have to pay for even if you are a hotel guest, it was $50 for men and $10 for women so we did not bother with that. Stick to the main pool its much more fun people watching and diving in and out of the wave pool. The hotel is connected to the Luxor and the Excalibur, you can walk between them or get the free monorail. It also has great shops which were not over priced either for Vegas.

There is tons of entertainment and bars as well - but in the 2 days that we were there we could barely scratch the tip of what the MB has to offer. The pool is a main draw - although personally I found the main pools too crowded and noisy. However there was a lovely pool just set off from the main pools which was much quieter and relaxing. You could even put your chairs in the pool and read a book which was a bonus when the temperatures soared to 107. The bedrooms are large and airy and have all the facilities required.

This is my second time staying at The Hotel (first was in May 2007). This most recent stay, we definitely noticed a lot more wear and tear in the room - upon arrival we had a very dusty room that clearly hadn't been cleaned or used in a while. The desk chair was broken as well as the door under the sink. We felt that the hotel service was so/so when we arrived (bell service took over an hour & we were forced to wait in our room to receive the bags). We would recommend that travelers skip the bell service so they are not stuck waiting in their room - they will not leave the bags if you're not there. All of these issues were resolved though & we enjoyed our stay. On the whole, we loved the apartment feel of the room & the separate living room & extra bathroom. The bathroom is luxury all the way & there are three TVs in the room (bathroom, bedroom & living room). We liked the living room, especially to meet up w/ friends before going out. We absolutely loved Mandalay Bay itself. Everyone was so friendly & the service, despite the small issues above, was excellent. In terms of gambling, the casino is very nice & the hotel attracts more of a sophisticated crowd in their late 20s/early 30s and up. You will not find the \"fratastic\" element here. The sports book is very cool as well. And, of course, we are hooked on Starbucks & loved that there was one in the hotel. As for shopping, go to Caesars - there's just not much at Mandalay. Also skip the House of Blues for breakfast - not that great. We liked the 24 hour restaurant for basic lunches & late night snacks - great variety & good service. The pool has recently been redone & it definitely felt like I was walking into an amusement park/Wally World - checking in through the turnstiles, food court, etc. We rented a cabana & thought it was worth it, especially for the shade & the TV. We were in the West Lagoon area though, which was definitely not the place to be - exceptionally tame. I would recommend getting a cabana either in East Lagoon or by the Beach - much more people watching & fun. The conceirge service was excellent - you should use them to book all of your reservations.

I'm pleased to say, it not only met my expectations, but far exceeded them in most every way possible. First off, TheHotel is a non-gaming hotel; while it's adjacent to the Mandalay Bay, and can be accessed via their casino, it has a completely different atmosphere and flavor than the adjoining property. From the moment you step out of your car at the Valet stand, and enter the first set of glass doors, your nose detects a gentle, floral scent (we learned from the Spa that it's a \"proprietary scent,\" and they wouldn't tell us what it was made of). Pass the second set of doors, and your eye is immediately drawn upward to a huge chandelier made of dozens of blown glass tear-drop shaped globes, suspended over a huge black table, displaying huge, tall vases of meticulously arranged white blooms. As you enter further, you come into a slightly dimmer-lit vestibule, decorated with an assortment of black absract paintings, and cases containing HUGE, 180 million year old chunks of quartz. A soundtrack of techno-lounge music plays softly in the background (and the mood/tempo of the music changes slightly throughout the day, ramping up to a slighly more danceable pace in the late evening hours). The overall vibe here is just 'cool.' Very contemporary, very clean and elegant. As you make your way to the check in counter, you'll pass TheCoffeeBar and TheLounge. Check in was seamless, and very pleasant. When the desk clerk learned it was our wedding/honeymoon, she made a phone call, and upgraded our suite to a larger, corner room. The elevator vestibule is a wonder of black marble (or granite?) with more arrays of white blooms and a very cool, dark feel, accented by indirect lighting. Upon entering the suite, we were greeted by what felt like a trendy apartment in a large downtown area. A half-bath in the foyer, tiled entryway, leading into a good-sized living room. The living room was furnished in a very contemporary fashion, dark colors, accented with bright splashes here and there. A couch, armchair, 42\" plasma flatscreen and a large writing desk and chair finish out the living room, as well as a mirrored wet-bar. From the bedroom, making the way into the bedroom, we were greeted with wrap-around glass, interrupted only by the wall-mounted entertainment center and another 42\" plasma. Luxurious linens and feather-down pillows made the bed, which was flanked by huge black side tables and mirrored panels, with a softly upholstered headboard. From the bedroom into the glamour bathrom... wow. Just a beuatiful, beautiful bathroom, the centerpiece of which was a huge, deep Roman tub, surrounded in black marble. The dual sinks, large shower, fluffy towels, plasma TV and in-house toiletries rounded it out to make a very pleasing place to soak at the end of a long day on the strip. While a minor thing to note, I was amused by the gradually-brightening lights in the bath, as well as in the commode room -- in the wee hours of the a.m., this is a very well appreciated touch. While we were very pleased with the room, we did experience some minor issues during our stay: While there was a card in the bathroom that indicated they were on a \"Green plan,\" and therefore only replaced towels on the 3rd day, or sooner upon request, we were miffed to find that by day 4, our bed sheets hadn't yet been changed at all (there was a small, telltale black inkspot on one of them, which made it easy to tell that they hadn't been changed). Additionally, it appeared housekeeping hadn't vacuumed our room at all over those same 4 days. Also, we noticed periodically a rather unpleasant odor coming from the half-bathroom. At first, we didn't think much of it, and I would light a candle to mask it, by on the 4th day, it became too strong to bear. So, on day 4, I contacted the front desk about these matters. It was late at night, so there wasn't a manager on duty, so I was assured one would contact me the following morning. When that didn't happen, I was a bit more than miffed. The following evening, we went to speak to another manager about the issues. She was appalled at the lack of response we'd received from the other manager, and went way above and beyond to make amends for it (including crediting some spa services we'd enjoyed, giving us a food and beverage credit on our account, and moving us into a Penthouse Suite for the duration of our stay). Needless to say, with as wonderful as we found the standard suite, the Penthouse was beyond our wildest expectations, with 180 degree views of the strip, and the mountains (it was on the end of the building, on the 43rd floor). Easily measuring upwards of 2000 square feet, it housed a large foyer, half bath, office, large living room with sectional sofa, 2 arm chairs and a 42\" plasma, dining room with seating for 6, and a large walk-in wet bar with barstools. The other end of the suite contained the bedroom, which has a small sittiing area with desk, another (smaller) living room with a love seat and two arm chairs, and a large upholstered ottoman/coffee table. Round the corner to the sleeping area, with a bed and side tables identical to the small suite, but dressed in finer linens (wonderful sheets). From there, there's a small hallway with two closets, and a full length mirror, and then the bathroom. The bath was similar to the smaller suite, with minor changes: a jacuzzi tub, a bidet, and the shower doubles as a steam-room. Towels and bath products have also been upgraded. Throughout the suite, there are control panels for the surround sound, and each room (including the bath) is wired with JBL speakers in the ceiling. You can tune the speakers in to the T.V. channel that is on, or radio, CD or DVD. Also, all draperies in the suite are operated by wall-mounted control panels. Once in this suite, we found it hard to even leave, as the nighttime views of the lights along the strip were just spellbinding. Valet and Bell staff were friendly and attentive throughout our stay (so please remember to tip them accordingly!). My only criticisms of the room are the following: Pillows - while they felt like real feather down, they were very thin, and flattened easily. We did have to request extra pillows, and even so, they were not up to par (especially considering how wonderful the bed was!) Closet Space - The closet space in our initial suite was somewhat limited, and then further crowded by the room safe atop the dresser. Apparently the non-corner rooms have a bit more closet space (two closets flanking the entertainment center), and it was a small sacrifice to make, however a bit more space would have been nice. However, all in all, our stay (in spite of the minor issues) was amazing. They went above and beyond to satisfy us, and it made for a wonderful and romantic honeymoon celebration.", "Date": "October 7, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "toronto", "Title": "\u201cnice hotel\u201d", "Author": "everddy", "ReviewID": "UR20680952", "Content": "The hotel is a classic looking hotel and I was looking at trying another part of the strip.

Last year we stayed at Mandalay Bay (where he proposed to me), this year my husband surprised me and booked our room at The Hotel at MB. Both times we have had great experiences. The Hotel decor is a dark brown with lighting that is appropriate to brighten. We had a one bedroom suite, which was perfect. The suite included a full bath and a half bath. It was nice having a \"living room\" area to sit and watch TV while waiting for the other to shower and get ready rather than having to sit on a bed all the time as in a standard room. One of the previous reviews mentioned that they didn't hear anything in the room from the hallways or adjoining rooms. I totally agree. The only time I heard anyone in the hallway was if I was standing at the entry to the living room area down the short hall from the door. Other than that, we didn't hear a peep. The MB complex is extremely large, so unless you're going out for dinner, wear comfortable shoes. MB is also adjoined to the Four Seasons Hotel, which has the Charlie Palmer Steak House. We splurged one evening for an awesome dinner there along with a bottle of wine. The whole meal was terrific and the wait staff were wonderful. This is a very pricey restaurant (at least in my book), but since we're not gamblers, when we travel to Vegas we always choose to have one splurge meal. The House of Blues is also a very good restaurant. This year we ate breakfast there one day. We've also had dinner on previous trips. You can't go wrong with this restaurant. By Vegas standards for a hotel on the strip, the prices are average, and you will always have more than enough food. My husband and I split the 4 egg omlet and an order of their donuts with dipping sauce (mmmmmm). We ended up taking half of the donuts back to the room to eat the next morning. We also rented a cabana one day just to kick back and relax by the pools. The wait staff was good, and they're not constantly bothering you. Some may like that, some may not. If you want service more frequently, just ask your server to come back more often. There is enough to do at the MB complex, that you really wouldn't need to leave if you chose not to. However, if you're a little more adventureous, rent a car for the day right from MB and go out to Red Rock Canyon for a close up view. This is the mountainous area you see in the distance off to the West of MB & The Hotel. They are beautiful!! We did just that this year and went hiking on some of the trails. Just be careful stepping on the loose rocks. I twisted my ankle twice. Also, take plenty of water and snacks with you too, as there really isn't anyplace to get those items out at Red Rock Canyon.

The lighting was very poor, so it was hard to put on makeup. The room was showing some wear - scraped up furniture, torn desk chair, etc. The bathtub is great - very deep tub and beautiful water spout. The beach area was so much fun - we went down every morning to play in the waves & the lazy river. The walk wasn't that bad to the beach - maybe 5-10 minutes. Housekeeping was terrible - they got worse and worse each day. They threw out our exisiting soaps and lotions and didn't replace them. When we tried to get more, they would only allow us one. They made up the beds crooked & just stacked out pillows in the center of the bed instead of placing them correctly. We got good service the first morning - that must be because we tipped really good the first time. The less we tipped, the worse service became. The Mandalay casino is very clean & just a couple minutes walk from THE Hotel. There is a bus stop across the street for north bound hotels and there is also a stop right outside Mandalay if you are coming from the north. Even though we had bad housekeeping & some scratched up furniture, I'd probably stay here again if it was a good price. The beach area was just too much fun to not do again.

The first night we drove up to the Bellagio, which is about mid-strip, and there were so many people walking the strip and in the hotel that after a couple hours we were ready for our escape back to TheHotel. The people were so thick, cars couldn't pass and that is no exaggeration. The Hotel is modern with a clean minimalist decor. The Suite rooms are extremly cozy and suit my taste - darker decor but lots of lamps to brighten it up if desired. The suites are the perfect size for a couple. The half bath was a delight. I love their bath products as well. My only complaint about the hotel was the price of the food. In some instances the cost soars beyond pricy into insulting levels. I do not mind dropping coin on meals and atmosphere - but as I said - insulting. We ate at the Border Grill the first night and the food was excellent. I also recommend Trattoria Del Lupo. The portions were large and I tried very hard to down the whole thing but couldn't. As with any large hotel, prepare yourself for lots of walking. I couldn't imagine how all the heeled ladies were getting around and still having a good time. We left $5 everyday and had a clean room and the extra 3 pillows we requested. I never heard a peep from other guests - not even slamming doors. The walls must be thick.

THEhotel does have a cool factor in its design, and the suites are very roomy and comfortable, but beyond that, things deteriorate a bit. Aside from what I already mentioned, the room was a bit worn for the price being paid. The carpet was fraying in a couple spots, there was a broken handle on the night stand, and the TV reception was awful. In addition to poor TV quality, the two larger sets in the living room and bedroom only seemed to have 2 volume settings: too loud, or too quiet. Then there is the pool. I usually spend one day lounging at the pool on a Vegas trip, and this time I decided to rent a cabana. This was no small expense - it was close to $350 for the day - this is more than the cost of the room upstairs. One day prior to my cabana rental date, my wife and I took a walk around the extremely crowded pool area and checked out the cabanas to see what we were getting for the money. The cabanas were set up practically right on top of each other, and had only thin fabric walls to filter out surrounding noise (other guests, screaming children, televisions in other cabanas, and the constant, thumping club music that is played throughout the pool area). The \"patio\" in front of the cabana offered you just a few square feet of the regular pool deck, and due to the overcrowding, other guests were virtually in your lap.

I was really looking forward to treating myself and my partner to a wonderful time at a hotel that is supposed to be top notch. I have to say that I was really disappointed! When we arrived at 10 p.m., I was told that the Non-smoking, King Bed that we booked was unavailable. In fact, there were NO non-smoking suites at all and we would have to move the following day. The individual who booked us in was unapologetic and completely indifferent. I have asthma and sleeping in a room permeated with smoke was awful! The front desk staff advised that a non-smoking, king suite with a strip view would be given to us the following day. So, we checked at the front desk at 1:00 p.m. the next day to get our new room and were told very rudely that NO rooms are guaranteed, there was no strip view and that we could come back at 5:00 for a strip view. At this point, I just want a room and agree to any non-smoking room! For the inconvenience, I wanted them to do something for us so they comped us $100 for food (which gave us 2 breakfasts and a lunch in the hotel). That was not given without speaking with another staff member. I observed others being checked in - for example, business travellers who seemed to be getting the royal treatment with the staff gushing over them. It seemed to us that a \"regular joe\" was given the bare minimum in terms of customer service. I found most of the staff that I encountered quite snotty. When we checked out, we were told that we owed money from one restaurant and a ridiculous amount of money from the mini-bar! We didn't even open the door to the mini bar. With investigation by the front desk, one restaurant bill wasn't transferred and, apparently, the mini bar charge was from a previous guest (yeah, sure!) In the end, we didn't owe anything and it was taken care of. I was really expecting so much more from theHotel. Yes, the hotel is beautiful, the suites are huge (found toenail clippings and hair in the bathroom....yeeeeesh!) but I felt that the staff honestly didn't care about their guests.

I requested a mini-frig for our room and it was delivered in 10 minutes. The room was VERY clean, well stocked, beautifully decorated and had tons of storage space for 3 women - even with all of our shoes, clothes, etc. LOL. We reserved a slightly larger suite that had both a full and half bath! Made for getting ready so much easier! The room had 2 large plasma TV's, sunken tub, wetbar, huge couch, etc. My girlfriends fell in love with the plush robes! To save $$, be sure to get the mini-frig for your room. The wetbar is stocked with a shaker, glasses, bottle openers, etc. The staff and service were great!!! Had to call for wake-up calls, extra towels, etc. and everytime they addressed me by name and made me feel like I was their priority! Don't waste your time at the club at the top of the hotel called MIX. Put our name on the list when I checked in and still had to wait when we got there at 1am. Club is small/narrow and has a very small dance floor. Outside balcony is reserved for VIP/bottle service so we couldn't go out for the view and fresh air. Not a lot of sitting space unless you get bottle service. Left after 10 minutes! The pools at Mandalay Bay aren't too far of a walk from THEhotel side and are nice. Word of advice - GET THERE EARLY if you want a chair in the main beach area. Or spend a lot of $$ and book a cabana! There are a few smaller pools off the beach area and those get busy too. Didn't go in the lazy river because it was packed. Discovered the South Lagoon Pool and it had plenty of seats - probably because the action (music, wave pool, lazy river and bar & grill) is at the main pool. Plus, It had a direct view of the Mandalay Convention Center's large parking lot so you don't feel as removed from the \"real world\" there.

Robes & slippers appeared only after calling housekeeping, toiletries were never replenished during our 4 day stay (until we ran out and again called housekeeping), TV remote was missing from room, and this very large suite had a single small wardrobe which was inadequate for 2 adults on a 4 day visit (and we don't bring a lot of \"outfits\"). Biggest problem was the pool. Lovely pool complex, but a long walk thru the parking garage, or even longer walk thru casino to reach pool. And, inexcusably rude treatment from a pool attendant on a quiet weekday afternoon. Towels were too small to fully cover the beach chairs, and we requested a 2nd towel. Attendant refused to provide a 2nd towel to each of us (3 guests), which prompted a 45 minute call first to the concierge, then a front desk staffer, and finally front desk manager @ TheHotel. Their \"rules\" don't permit more than 1 towel/guest, but they \"would make an exception\" for me. When I returned to the pool after the calls, the attendant gave me 1 towel, & when I said \"but we are 3 people\" I got some kind of answer along the lines of \"so what, 3? It's just another number. 3 + 1 make 4, 3 + 3 make 6,\" and so on, and he still refused to provide me with the 3 towels requested He did everything but give me the finger! We brought friends along for their 1st visit to Las Vegas, and as their host, I was terribly embarrassed by the treatment we received. I have never had an issue like this (having to beg for a 2nd towel), nor have I ever encountered rudeness from any hotel staff member, ever. I rarely ask for anything, and almost never have complaints. TheHotel's \"pool policy\" (allowing for only a single towel) & staff problem would have been disappointing at a low-end motel, but was really outrageous at a hotel which promotes itself as a luxury property.

Getting to the hotel from the airport is a breeze and surprisingly the traffic on LVB on a Friday night wasn\u2019t horrendous. My sister and I arrived at the hotel around 9:00 PM and didn\u2019t have much of a wait. We were offered a king room even though I had reserved a room with two doubles. I was told it was late (9:00 PM is late?!?!?) and nothing else was available, but they could downgrade us for one night and then move us the next morning to a suite with two doubles. We were only staying for three nights so I wasn\u2019t interested in unpacking, packing and unpacking again so I told them the king room was fine \u2013 it\u2019s my sister after all, I\u2019m used to her cooties <LOL>. I was then informed they only had a handicap accessible room available and would that be fine? I didn\u2019t see us as having any other choices so I accepted the room. I completely understand stuff happens and you don\u2019t always get the room you want, but why does this always seem to happen to me? We didn\u2019t need a room with a fabulous room and I find it hard to believe they had nothing left but a king/handicap accessible room. My guess is they didn\u2019t want to upgrade me to a nicer room at no charge. We arrived at the room which wasn\u2019t too far from the elevator. I was little concerned at the potential noise level, but it never bothered me \u2013 my sister on the other hand was somewhat bothered by it. The living room was nice and spacious and having a \u00bd bath is great when someone else is using the other bathroom. For me, having a mini bar isn\u2019t necessary due to the cost of the goods, I\u2019d much rather have a mini fridge to store my beverages in and I was disappointed we didn\u2019t have that option. The bedroom appeared to have queen bed rather than a king, but I wasn\u2019t sure and I didn\u2019t want to call down to the front desk and sound like a moron. It seemed like it was the same size as my bed at home (a queen) \u2013 dunno, maybe I was wrong. The bathroom on the other hand was a real letdown. We didn\u2019t have the nice marble enclosures the other rooms had, but instead the shower and tub were the fiberglass units many of us have at home. What a bummer. In addition, they weren\u2019t very appealing to look at. Both the shower and tub bottoms were stained with soap scum. A little elbow grease, a scrub brush, and bleach works for me \u2013 they should give it a try. Not to mention, by the time either of us were done taking a shower we were standing in ankle deep water. I tried on three separate occasions to contact housekeeping/maintenance about fixing it, but ended up on hold for five minutes before giving up. Sorry, but I was in Vegas to have a good time, not to sit around and wait for someone to pick up the phone. We chose to deal with it and make the most of our trip. My sister passed out on the couch a couple of nights and complained of the noise during the night. I never heard anything, but I\u2019m a heavy sleeper. She said the noise coming the adjoining room door was unbearable and she could clearly hear people in the hallway. I\u2019ve typically found this to be a problem with many hotels in Vegas and have simply chalked it up to \u201cthat\u2019s the way it is.\u201d The walls are thin in Vegas <shrug>. We hit the pool rather late on Saturday and that was a HUGE mistake. If you\u2019re not down there by an early hour you can forget finding a chair. This doesn\u2019t hold true for every day, just Saturday. We spent half an hour searching for a chair and then gave up. We staked out a parcel of sand and laid out our towels. BEWARE: during the summer, by noon the sand is too hot to walk on \u2013 flip flops are a must. I managed to grab us some chairs after an hour or so and we enjoyed the rest of our day by the pool. The wait staff was wonderful and always managed to keep our glasses filled. It was hot though, we spent most of our time sitting in the pool and drinking our beverages. God, you\u2019ve gotta love Vegas. All in all it was a good stay and I wish we had more time to stay there. I\u2019m not exactly sure if I\u2019d stay there again as it\u2019s rather pricey and if you\u2019re only going to sleep there I really can\u2019t justify paying that kind of money.

There is no dinging from the slot machines, no large hords of conventioneers roaming around.

However just like during our stay last year at Mandalay Bay, housekeeping leaves a lot to be desired. The floors in both of the bathrooms were definitely dirty (stains, hair, etc) which made it clear that they are not properly cleaned. Also, for being a fairly new hotel, the furniture in our suite was pretty dinged up. Again, just like last year we had a \"pool\" view, which means a view of the pool as well as the airport. However, we paid very little for the room so I am not complaining about that.. just know that that is what a pool view is. The front desk staff was very nice, however when we checked in, we had to wait a good half hour in a long line to do so.

The bed was extremely comfortable, and I loved the TV in the bathroom. Due to the layout, you cannot hear anything happening in the hallway in the bedroom of the suites, so it was very quiet.

After searching our room for 2 hours we finally agreed our items were in fact stolen while we were all (2 men, 2 women) asleep. We called security who took a statement and followed missing items protocol. Myself and my roommate went to the last place our friend had his wallet- the pop machine.

We ran back into the room, told the security officer who recovered the purse and brought it down to the front desk. We complained, called, went down to talk to literally everyone who had any type of authority to do something about the situation. The hotel ran us around in circles for a day and half.

We also requested that the police be called and brought into the hotel lobby as we would like to file our robbery complaint- the money from the wallet was never recovered- this was denied.

We had chosen The Hotel due to the great reviews of the Mandalay Bay pools. The week before we departed I had tried to book a Cabana (on the hotel internet site) for 2 days while we were there (a Saturday and a Tuesday). After settling into our suite we took a tour of the hotel and pool area and went to make sure our email had been received and the bookings confirmed, as we had received no reply. I was told that if we hadn't gotten an email back then there was nothing available - Cabanas can be booked up to 30 days in advance and it looks like in the middle of August you actually have to reserve it 30 DAYS prior. We were so disappointed with this, as this was the main reason we\u2019d chosen this hotel. From a hotel who claims to be 5 star, I found it hard to accept that at the very least we were not sent a reply informing us that the Cabanas were fully booked. We actually considered moving hotels at this point and getting something that had a better position on the strip; we decided to stay and make the most of what we had. On the Tuesday we managed to get a beachside Cabana ($500) through a cancellation and had a great day in both the beach pool and the lazy river. It was expensive, but then I guess when it\u2019s booked out 30 days prior they can charge what the like! The waitresses were great, and came but every half hour or so to make sure we had everything we needed. As for the positives, the suite was great, a separate lounge area with plasma TV and second toilet. A huge bathroom with a TV, large bath, separate shower, 2 sinks and another toilet. Great bed, with another TV (not plasma). As mentioned above, we didn\u2019t have a view of the strip, just the road behind, but not a big issue after the first day. We had room service one night, ate in the Mandalay Bay restaurants on 2 other nights, and then had dinner elsewhere on the other nights. All the food was great and we didn\u2019t feel it was either overpriced (or underpriced). Every morning we had coffee and juice as well as a muffin from the cafe in the hotel reception, which was quick, well priced and tasty. Loved the fact that we could walk through a connecting hall to the Luxor and on to the Excalibur for something different \u2013 a relief that we didn\u2019t have to go outside in the August heat. There was also a free monorail between these 3 hotels that we used as well. The Mandalay Bay and the Hotel are at the end of the strip and so if you want to walk the strip it is nice that you can get back via a train or through air-conditioned casinos on your return. On the whole, we had a great time, came away without losing any money (about even for the 5 days, so very happy with that!), but probably wouldn\u2019t stay at The Hotel again. We\u2019ve been to Vegas before and stayed at the MGM \u2013 thought the Cabanas were better there (value for money, service, extras), and while the pools were definitely bigger at the Mandalay Bay, the MGM lazy river was fantastic! With the position of The Hotel being at the very end of the strip, everything would have had to be perfect for me to want to return there, as it wasn\u2019t we will be trying something different next time, somewhere in the middle of the strip.", "Date": "August 27, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sunderland, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cSheer Luxury\u201d", "Author": "monkeytours", "ReviewID": "UR19381598", "Content": "What can I say ... worth every penny.

We always said nothing would ever beat our room at the Grand Hyatt in Dubai but this certainly did and I would recommend to anyone. Only downside could not e-mail hotel before getting there, had to call but this was fine using a proxy caller to get cheap calls. Was able to transfer to a deal price after I booked when a special offer came out after booking, this was no problem to them and got us free spa passes etc. There are loads of reataurants to choose from and a club/Bar on the 64th floor overlooking the strip which is fantastic.

Check in was good as we had arrived very early and missed any crowd. Staff was friendly. We were originally booked into the Bay but we upgraded to the Hotel suite for an extra $54 a night (well worth it). Weekday prices were good at $170. (Weekend prices were crazy) Suite was excellent. Very clean. Great view. Huge bathroom with double sink and a half bathroom in the hallway for guests. Beds were very comfy. TV in every room, even the bathroom! I asked for a discount on the upgrade but they said no because the Hotel was nearly full. A lie cause you can tell how full the floor is by how many morning newspapers are left outside the doors and my floor was barely half full. The first night we were all very tired and when I turned down the bedsheets I found what appeared to be blood on the sheets. We complained and they cleaned up very well. They gave us an apology and compt us a one night upgrade of $54 and told us the stain was actually only rust (sure!). Regardless of what it was the shock value was worth more than $54 in my mind. Call ahead to rent your Cabana or you may find they are all taken. Be prepared for high prices (starting at $250). I had to put my name on a list. If called in to take one after the noon hour they said they would discount the price but that did not happen to me when they offered a tent to me at 12:30. I asked but they said no. I found the Cabanas were low grade for the money compared with other hotels. Our hostess was great but the waitress was on her monthly friend I'm sure. When the waitress took a break nobody replaced her so I had to get my own drinks. There were no misters (water mist), Lounge chairs came with no cushions. Cabanas are not roped off so everyone piles up in front of your spot without regard for your access or view. At the TI my price included a bottle of sparkling wine and a small fruit plate along with the basics. At the MB it came with nothing except your basics like water and pop. In the casino I was playing max bets on a 25 cent slot and it took over an hour before a waitress got to me. Expect everything to very expensive! It will cost about $30 just to sneeze here! A muffin will cost $3.50. Three large pancakes will run $12. Lunch at $20 and dinner at leat $30. If you are a good eater then the buffet is your best bet. Not cheap but good value. The MB is at the far south end of the strip and getting around can be very exhausting. There are available forms of transit but they do get busy and can take time to travel up and down the strip due to heavy traffic. I recommend renting a car from the airport with a GPS. Total with taxes will run about $40 a day and is well worth the freedom to explore and get around in comfort. All Hotel parking is free. Every Hotel can easily take up a city block and the blocks in Vegas are almost a half mile long. Unfortunately Vegas is becoming an expensive place to go and the days of discounts are quickly leaving. Ticket discount places usually buy up lower quality seating areas and people offerring free tickest only want you to spend the whole day looking at their rental properties first! Try to avoid the hot season at it gets REAL hot!!! and exhaustion can set in real fast and walking around is just not comfortable at all. When we checked out they asked if all was went well. After telling the issues with the pool and suite they compt me $75. A nice jesture. I would probably not return to the MB as the cost exceeds what I can afford to budget.

It is linked to the Luxor and Excalibor by a regular tram, but I would still have preferred to be slightly more central (maybe New York New York location). The strip is much longer to walk than seems at first sight, especially in the heat. I was travelling with my 16 year old son and so we had booked a suite, with a rollaway in the lounge. We checked in OK, but on reaching the room it was actually being used as the trash room and was not ready for use. The lady responsible for cleaning the floor called her manager, and they were very nice, but nothing could be done to make the room ready for at least an hour. She suggested I talk to front desk which I did, and they credited the room with $100 food allowance, so the hours wait was worth it, no complaints here. When we did get in...room very nice. Carpet a bit dodgy looking, but rest of room impressive, very tastefully decorated. Partial view of strip / Luxor. TV\u2019s literally in every room- lounge, bedroom AND bathroom. Couldnt get DVD in lounge or IPOD dock in bedroom to work, but maybe that was me, and as we didn\u2019t get to spend much time there I didn\u2019t get it sorted. Good shower and toiletries. Iron and ironing board. In the hotel complex there was a Starbucks (good for early morning trips), and several decent restaurants, I liked the fact that within the complex you had different price ranges to choose from for meals. Also you could easily buy water / drinks / snacks from several shops \u2013 whilst more expensive than supermarkets you did not have to rely on mini bar prices. The shopping centre between Mandalay and Luxor, Mandalay Place, was pricey but not extortionate, and they had a very good selection, I would shop there again. BUT I did not like the pools very much. It had been much lauded as a real sandy beach with wave pool. But the sun beds (hundreds lined up in rows like sardines) had no shade whatsoever, and after about 15 minutes in the 40 degrees sun I had to stand under a tree and wait for my son to finish in the pool. It was a real disappointment for me. Design \u2013wise, the Mandalay hit all the right spots and could not be faulted. But with a 16 year old, I could not help feeling that we would have been better in a slightly different type of hotel such as New York New York.

We stayed at the Mandalay bay booked through expedia. We were there July 31st-August 5th. Overall we really liked it. I have been to Vegas many times but my husband had not so I was set on getting him a strip view. I had heard that only floors 20 and above were good so wehn checking in I asked for that. The woman behind the counter was really friendly and nice. The lines were long but I expected that from reading other reviews on here so it didn't bother me. Anyway, I insited on a strip view on floor 20 or above but she said she had a strip view on floor 17. The room was really great, nice large bed, flat screens, nice bathroom and..TA DA an amazing view of the strip. I was so excited! Overall we really liked it but agree AUGUST is HOT in Vegas..I think it reached 106 daily! I wanted to write to tell you how to save money b/c all the other reviews are correct Vegas is EXPENSIVE. First of all, if you are staying at mandalay, it's not like you are stranded on a resort in jamaic or the d.r.. I mean go out the front door, walk across the street(look both ways foolios) and go to the liquor store, the conv. store, the mcdonalds, the panda express! Seriously, people complain about no coffee makers, well get your lazy tooshies out the door and walk the freakin' 100 feet to the McDonalds and get a coffee. I think they even have the fancy flavors now, whoo pee doo! I like panda express, yummy chinese,..whatever.. I don't need to drop $$50-100 on breakfast and lunch. That's just silly. And, weak drinks at the pool? Go to the liquor store..seriously it's directly acorss the street from mandalay! Get yourself some cranberry juice and voda or stolio o and sprite and make a drink or two in your room while you are gettting ready you can have a cocktail or grab a to go cup from the pool area, bring back to your room and VOILA..cocktail to go and you jsut saved yourself a god $100 by purchasing your own stuff. As far as spending money save it for dinner and a view or a show! We had dinner at le eiffel tower restaurant and it was awesome! You can see the bellagio fountains going off every 15 mintues (ask for a window seat) and have a yummy meal. they even gave my hubby a free birthday dinner dessert. (tell the hostess) Dinner at Le Eiffel Tower Restaurant at the Paris Hotel cost us $250 with drinks, appetizer (try the escargot, I'd never had it, and it really was good, altho I'm glad it came chopped up and not pretty woman style) that's $125.00 each. Don't expect huge portions, but def. decent. If you don't want to cough up the cash for dinner there, then def. go for drinks, they say dress code but it seemed to me like they didnt' care, we saw people in Jeans. Anyway, a cocktail will drop you back..umm..I think $18.00 if I remember correctly but the view is pretty cool. Other than that..check out the Wynn, its pretty spectacular and have a drink on the patio overlooking the fountains! Have fun and ride the deuce! We loved it! It picks you up outside the panda express, mcdonalds on the strip outside mandalay. It's FIVE DOLLARS for a 24 hour bus pass. It's a cool double decker, air condiitoned bus, that comes every 15 mintues and goes ALL up and down the strip ..even down to freemont. Plus if you are looking to pick up, it seemed like all the hot, drunk younger girls rode this bus late at night) Other than that, during the day the crowd was a mix of everybody but mostly tourists.

This was our second visit to TheHotel. We stayed at the Wynn last year but found the Mandalay Bay resort far superior. Check in was very quick and staff courteous. Suites are huge and bathrooms fantastic. I have no idea how anyone can complain about these rooms. The whole Mandalay resort is great. Yes i agree with other people the beach is far too crowded and if you get a bed round the beach it feels as if you are almost laying on top of each other!! Pools are great though and much needed in 110 degree heat! Despite what others have said, the drinks and food round the pool are great. No it is not cheap, but hey, this is Vegas and the drinks/ food prices are in line with the rest of Vegas. The Mandalay Bay comes into its own at night. The choice of resturants and bars are amazing, Personal favourites were Rumjungle, China Grill, and Eyecandy bar in the centre of the Casino is great. Do not miss the Mix bar. It is by far one of the best bars in Vegas with amazing views. On the negative side, i do find it amazing that they charge you $20 to use the gym and charge you daily for Broadband use!!! If you are paying a lot of money to stay at this hotel i think the fact that you are charged to use these services is a discrace. Location is not a problem at all. In fact is nice to be away from the central craziness of the strip. Overall a great hotel, with lots going on.

The room and bathroom are fine and the property itself is new and spectacular. However the staff were discourteous and uninterested in helping. We had a few problems such as a gurgling toilet noise in our bathroom that were unaddressed. The \"Ticket Counter\" was never open when we passed by and the Box Office sold only tickets for the Mandalay Bay's own shows. The Concierge is supposed to book tickets to shows around the Strip but seemed uninterested in helping us and treated us impolitely. The pool area (including wave pool, jacuzzi and raft ride) was extremely overcrowded, even on a weekday, and the water seemed dirty. The drinks at the pool bar were awful, but that didn't stop the hotel from charging top dollar. We're not expert gamblers, but we noticed that the casino seemed to cater exclusively to people placing bigger bets; it was harder for us to place a few small \"fun\" bets than it was in casinos in the other properties. Finally, the location was a big drawback; it was a real chore to get from the hotel to the central Strip. First you have to take the hotel's tram to the Excalibur property, walk over the elevated crossing to the New York, New York property, then walk over another elevated crossing to the MGM Grand. If you then want to get to the Las Vegas Monorail you have to walk through or around the MGM. All this takes maybe half an hour on average, and can be tiring in the hot weather.

I wanted 2 rooms connecting with 2 queen beds each. At 2pm Eastern time, I got an email confirming my reservation at THEHotel. I was thrilled! When they arrived, they said they did not have any connectiong rooms, but they could upgrade us to two suites on the same floor for no additional cost. The rooms were exactly like you see in the pictures and on the website. It was perfect. The amount of space was needed with 3-4 girls in each rooms. 1.5 bathrooms came in very handy when we were getting ready to go out or hungover the next day. We had a mini fridge in our room, worth the $$. On our last day we checked out of the hotel and we checked into our cabana which we booked for the birthday girl. $350 for a friday on the Lazy river island.

Bring your own tubes for the lazy river and ask the Tube guy to fill it up for $1 tip. Drinks are $10-$14 and food is $10+. There were a lot of kids at the lazy river tu-thursday. They get in the way of relazing and they are jumping alover the place. The east Lagoon and West Lagoon pools were better for adults. We were there during a freak lighting and rain storm. They will close the pools if this happens and not reopen for atleast 45 minutes after the last lightning strike. Since we had checked out of the hotel and were not catching the Red-eye flight till 11pm, we showered in the open showers near the bathrooms/beach and changed in the cabana.

I've stayed there in the past because they have the best pool on the strip, because I can get a two-bedroom suite for less than I'd pay for a regular room at the Four Seasons (another favorite hotel), and because I can walk to the Luxor and Excaliber hotels via indoor walkways, so I never have to face the Las Vegas heat if I don't want to. HOWEVER, the lack of service during my last stay at this hotel was unforgivable and indicates that this hotel is having serious management and/or financial issues. Read on for the ugly details (it's a long review): The problems started before we even arrived. I made a reservation for three nights after receiving a \"floating holiday\" solicitation from the hotel offering a third night's stay for free. I decided that I would make this a luxurious mini-vacation and tried to reserve a garden cabana (their most expensive cabana @ $700/day, which includes use of a private pool) for two days of our stay via the Mandalay Bay website. Although their website promises a response within 24 hours, I heard nothing back. I e-mailed again a few days later. This time, I received a short little message back that said \"the cabana you have requested is not available.\" Nothing else. Since I was e-mailing two months before my trip, I was a little surprised by the unavailability. I e-mailed back asking what cabanas, if any, were available (information that any good customer service agent would have offered me without my asking). I then received an e-mail that said ALL cabanas were available, I just wasn't allowed to reserve them more than 30 days in advance. (Their website says you should make reservations AT LEAST 30 days in advance, which implies the more advance notice the better, but apparently not.) No offer of additional assistance was made. So I made a mental note to e-mail again in a couple of weeks. 25 days before my trip I e-mail again requesting a garden cabana. Again, I'm told that no cabanas are available, but if I'd like to come down to the cabana office by the pool, they will put my name on a waiting list. Obviously, they misread the dates in my e-mail and think I'm asking for a cabana that same weekend. Finally, I have my husband call the hotel directly. After speaking to someone in person, he is able to reserve a $250/day cabana for only one day of our stay. Shocked at the total failure of any customer service at a hotel I frequently stay at, I send an e-mail to Bill Hornbuckle, the CEO of Mandalay Bay. I get a generic letter back from Kim Cimini, Senior VP of Operations that apologizes for the lack of service and assures me that the hotel \"consistently strives to exceed our guests\u2019 expectations by providing superior customer service every day, to every guest prior to their arrival and during their stay\" and thanks me for giving Mandalay Bay another opportunity to serve me. We arrive at Mandalay Bay about 4:30 p.m. on Sunday, June 30. The lines to check in look about an hour long. I have never seen it so bad in all the years I've been going to Vegas (15+ years). The people in line with me agree. They've never seen it so bad either. The front desk clerk says \"Nope. Sundays are always like this. You should try coming on Wednesdays instead.\" (I have to wonder: if Sundays are always so bad, why don't they have a full staff working? I would say a third of the check in windows were closed.) We wait in line for about 30 to 45 minutes. Some lines are worse than others because the front desk clerks keep leaving their posts to confer with a person at a seperate area behind the counter. We make it to the front of our line. The front desk clerk checks our reservation, smiles then says she'll be right back and goes to confer with the mystery person behind the desk. When she comes back we find out the real reason check-in lines are a mile long: they have over-sold the hotel. They have already given away the room that I booked two months ago (for which I had already paid one night's stay at $389). Instead of the 1450-sq. ft, two-bedroom, two-bath suite with a dining and living area that I reserved (and paid for), they offer us a regular, 450-sq. ft queen room with two double beds for the first night at the \"discounted\" rate of $275/night and $100 food credit, and they promise to move us to our reserved room the following day. The front-desk clerk talks really fast during this offer, and I am confused. \"You're putting us in one room with two-double beds?\" I ask her. \"It's two rooms. It's just like your reservation, but without the parlor,\" she replies. \"Are the rooms connecting?\" I ask. She looks at me like I'm dense. \"It's one room,\" she says and then repeats \"It's just like your reservation, but without the parlor.\" Huh? I'm thoroughly confused. So I choose a different approach. \"How many beds are there?\" \"Two\" \"There are five people in my party. That's not enough.\" \"We can send up a roll away.\" \"Do we have any other options?\" \"Not really\" Fine. She hands us our keys, doesn't tell us our room number or even direct us to the elevators. We figure all of this out on our own. We get to our room, and the keys don't work. We sit down in the hallway and wait for security. When we get in the room, I fail to see how it is \"just like the room we reserved, but without the parlor.\" If we had tried to reserve this room for a party of five people, the hotel would have refused and told us to book two rooms. We definitely exceed the room's maximum capacity. We call and complain. They discount the room further (to $109/night, the more realistic rate for this room) and swear that our transition to our new room tomorrow will be flawless. The next day I have to rise by 8:00 a.m. to make sure that I check in with the cabana folks before 9:30 or, I'm told, they will give our cabana away. The pool opens at 8:00 a.m., but the cabana office does not open until 9:00. I get down to the pool by 8:45 a.m., and there is another long line for me to wait in. When the cabana office opens, a huge, tall gentlemen announces that everyone who has a reservation should stay put. Everyone who wants to be put on a waiting list should line up behind him. There is a mad dash by the non-reservation people to get in the new line, and I felt bad for the people who had come down at 8:00 a.m. so that they could be first in line only to be snaked by those people lucky enough to be standing closer to the new line location. I wait patiently for my turn to check in. My turn comes, and the tall man skips right over me and starts helping the couple behind me. The husband of the couple apologizes profusely to me after being helped and points out to the tall man that I am next. The tall man is not so apologetic for skipping over me. By now, I had no confidence that they would actually find our cabana reservation, but they had it, and it was nice to have a place to relax by the pool. If you didn't have a cabana, finding a place to sit at the pool past 9:00 a.m. is next to impossible. It would have been nice to have a cabana for the next day, but I didn't see the use of waking up early again only to wait in line and be declined. I ask my husband, Do you think it's possible, we're already on a waiting list? Ms. Cimini, the Senior VP of Operations, did say in her letter (and I quote directly) \"You may be confident that every effort is also being put forth to fulfill your request for a cabana or private bungalow on Tuesday, July 1. \" So we ask. Of course, we're not on any waiting list, and no one can put us on a waiting list until the 9:00 a.m. cabana frenzy each morning. I guess \"every effort\" means \"no effort what so ever\" in Mandalay Bay speak. Check-out is at 11:00 a.m. each day. By 1:00 p.m., no one has called us regarding our new room, so my husband calls the front desk. He's told the room is still occupied and they'll call us when it's ready. By 4:00 p.m., we've been at the pool all day and need to go back to our room and get ready for a show. No one has called us, and the prospect of all five of us fighting for the single bathroom in our single, tiny room is depressing. So much for a flawless transition. We call the front desk again. The person we speak to can find no record of our transfer, but miraculously finds a suite that's available. It is not the 1500 3X that I reserved (and paid for one night), but is a 1500 2X, which means it has only two king beds, but they agree to provide a rollaway bed at no charge (the 15002X is priced at $310/night vs. $369/night for the 15003X). We are told we can transfer immediately, and our old keys should work on the new room. They don't. We sit out in the hallway again waiting for security. We get into the room and try to call down to the front desk for new keys. Only one of the 3 phones in the room work. Other than that, the suite is nice. All in all, it is a great value for the money. Finally in our new room, we enjoy the rest of our stay. Until check out. The line to checkout on Wednesday, July 2 was about 20 people deep. We can't do Express Check-out, because we have to hand the front desk clerk our credit slip to get our $100 food credit. I notice that most of the people checking out have credit slips. When I get to the front, I'm told the $100 credit is only good for specific food locations (their buffet, room service or Raffles Cafe). It does not include food service by the pool, which is where we thought we were spending it. Finally, however, after three days of obtuse employees who were sometimes deliberatly misleading and almost always unhelpful, the front desk clerk actually says \"let me see what I can do\" and helps me out. Despite the restrictions on the credit, she credits our meal by the pool and also the two movies that we rented, earning the Mandalay Bay one star for this review. IN SUMMARY: As a guest, I felt like I was punished for being nice.

On the 13th floor, we had a suite with an adjoining king room - 2 bedrooms, a common living room area and 3 bathrooms in all, and we had the same configuration on the 19th floor as well - a perfect set-up for a large group of women, and fairly priced with everyone chipping in. The bathrooms are HUGE, almost a little bigger than necessary (unless you're a bride in a huge wedding dress). The bathtub is spacious with a waterfall tub filler on the side, and the shower is large with great water pressure/temperature, a rainfall shower head and very cool tile. They supply lots of signature amenities with creative names (THE-everything), from shoe-polish to shower caps and all the usuals in-between. The shampoo and conditioner worked well, although the scent wasn't all that appealing, in my opinion. Q-Tips, cotton balls, natural (oatmeal I think it was) body soap and glycerine soap for the face puts THE Hotel a step above as far as amenities go :) The bed was one of the most comfortable I've ever slept on. My first night there, I had to sleep on the couch - which was also extremely comfy.

We had never been to Vegas and were looking forward to the trip. First the good, this is a stunning property. The hotel suite is nicely appointed and well-decorated. A one bedroom easily holds a family of 4 happily - and we have a 12 and 14 year old. The hotel does smell lovely. There is much less noise than other hotels on the strip and the air in the casino was clean. The pool area is a blast. You get the feeling you at the beach. Food in the restaurants is very good and service is good except for the buffet. Now for the bad. My flight arrived at 11:30 and I arrived at the hotel with my family a tad after midnight. I was the only person checking in. Apparently they gave away my room since I did not \"arrive\" that day (though I called and informed reservations that I would not be in before midnight.) We waited at the front desk for about a 1/2 hour for them to 'find' me a clean room. I was told that the hotel was fully committed but despite my late arrival they were going to honor my reservation. (That was a direct quote from the night manager.) When we get to our first room, housekeeping is still cleaning it. When they see us at the door they tell us to come back in 20 minutes. The room was a holy mess. I use the phone to call the front desk and I am placed on hold with the front desk night manager for about 20 minutes. He finds us another suite that is already clean and tell us that a bell hop will meet us there with the new keys. When we get to that room, there is no bell hop and now it is closer to 1:00 AM. When I go down to the front desk, the attendant meets me with a dumb stare and tells me he knows nothing of my situation. Once I explain , he defensively tells me that housekeeping told him the room was ready and he can't be held accountable for housekeeping's lies (another direct quote). He finally gives me the keys for the new room. As I am walking away, I ask to have manager call me in the AM, and he tells me that he will 'notate my account.' In the morning I speak with a manager who tells me she is stunned and this is unacceptable, so she comps me the first night's stay. I think that the service issues are over at this point. I inform her that the bedroom phone is no working and that the shower leaks water at an alarming rate and she tells me while I am at my meeting that day all problems will be resolved. We all go off for the day and come back at night to shower before going to a show. Neither issue was taken care of and after 4 showers, I am on my hands and knees using every towel in the suite to mop up the water in the room. I call housekeeping to explain and request the room be cleaned up and turn down service. I was told there was a 2 hour wait. We get back at 12:30 and housekeeping never showed up. A call to housekeeping is a waste of time (I am asked, \"What would you like us to do at this hour?\") A call to the house manager gets housekeeping and engineering to our room in under 3 minutes. The shower and phone issue were never addressed during our stay and we learned how to place towels in front of the shower door to absorb the water. Turn down service did happen every night after that. The pool complex is wonderful and service there is great. Drinks are very, very expensive. My one complaint here is the 'closing' time. The pool is suppose to close at 7:00 PM. At about 6:30, the teenagers with their aviator shades start telling you to get out. At 6:45 they start stacking chairs and moving personal items. The shut down of the pool complex borders on rude. They need to honor the 7:00 closing time and clean up after guests have excited the pool complex. I suspect management has no idea this is how guests are treated by this department. Room service is horrible here. Long waits for cold food. The beauty of the property almost makes you overlook the the customer service issues and I suspect one would love this property if they did not need to contact the front desk during their stay.", "Date": "June 28, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Netherlands", "Title": "\u201cNot THE Hotel but THE Rooms\u201d", "Author": "grummelNetherlands", "ReviewID": "UR17301106", "Content": "It all started out wrong with the unfriendly welcoming at the desk. We just checked out at Mirage and booked 3 more nights at The Hotel as it advertises itself as more non-casino and has a big pool. Moreover The Hotels has no real entrance its more a concrete parking lot entry:( The not-so-friendly desk guy was more concerned with the simple fact that he was afraid that we already went to our room which was not yet avalaible after we had to check out at Mirage(We were still MGM customers) and did not hand out a floor plan of the hotel. We only wanted to have a look at the amenities, a drink and than go to our room. There was no welcoming either thats suits a five star hotel! All over the world u get a drink or a cold towel or whatever. Here not even a: nice to have u here, which costs nothing. The big search for the pool began. The hotel has NO pool, you have to walk a mile in your bikini and swimming trousers either over the parking lot , being stared at by limo and taxi drivers or over the Mandalay casino floor, being stared at by gamblers!, to the Mandalay pool..... All the reviews are positive on this pool. Well we expect more in a five star hotel. The pool was so crowded during the weekend and even during the week that even as a The Hotel-suite guest, u have to search and hunt for a place to sit. The pool is more like a municipal pool. U have to grab the towels yourself and they come in seven colours off-white! (Too old) The beds are dirty and old too. After finally being able to find a spot, we waited for 43 minutes for a waitress to come by and another 15 minutes to be able to get two soft drinks! Thats BAD service. My friend had to get back all the way to the room because there are no lockers or guards that will look after your camera, creditcards or sunglasses, while there are a lot of stories that things get stolen. Talking about the this to the pool staff makes no sense either as they are not aware of the fact that u pay 1000 dollars for three nights for a suite and they remain indifferent... The pool with waves is probably not designed on safety as u get directed by four guards not to get too far at the back the left , the right AND the front, which makes the pool a lot smaller and unrelaxed. The lazy river offer swimtubes for rent at 20 dollars a day to hotelguests, there was one guy in a huge swimtube who bought it for 4 dollars outside the hotel. Sure the pool looks cool on pics but in reality it is not that big and every inch is covered by beds and the service is poor . Vegas probably doens't know anymore to cater to the upper middle class. Only if you pay extra for a cabana 300 -3000 dollars.... If not your certainly not at a five star hotel......and u get better service at a municipal pool in many places in the world. After a big discussion, we were really disappointed and almost left the place, the manager was so professional to give us a big discount. Well we rather had a cheaper and smaller room at Mandalay or another MGM hotel. Anyway we spent the money on drinking and dining at The Mix-Ducasse, Atelier-Robuchon, and Bradley Ogden plus a Elton John concert. The concierge was very helpful and gave us back our holiday feeling again. The suite was great and the cleaning staff of the rooms were great, but a hotel is SO much more than just the room. As a Vegas visitor I dont want to be able to have a look behind the stage/curtains. At night its a magical illusion especially at The Mix. During the day you look down on the terrible roof of the parking lot... So its not a room with a view either.

Maybe they stayed at another Mandalay Bay but my experience was totally different. Firstly, the rooms are huge, clean and smelled nice, which are musts when I visit a hotel. Secondly, the beds were comfortable and the feather pillows were a nice touch. Our view of the strip was lovely, however, since the hotel is located towards the end of the strip closest to the airport (maybe a mile or 2 away) you can see part of the runway. I didn't mind because it was fun looking at the strip and then watching the planes take off, lol. Thirdly, the bathrooms are beautiful. I'm not one to take a bath but once you look at the tub you just want to jump in and have a luxurious bubble bath. Fourth, the beach/pool was nice. It's not spectacular or anything but it's a heck of a lot better than half the places I've seen. They went through a lot of trouble to make it felt as much like a beach as possible and the staff worked very hard to make sure everyone was being taken care of. The one day I went it was packed and a staffer went around trying to secure lounge chai rs for everyone while a waitress went around making sure everyone had a drink. Now I couldn't imagine the bed linens being stained but if they were I'm sure housekeeping would replace them immediately. Speaking of housekeeping, I've never met a nicer professional cleaning staff. This is my first hotel experience where the cleaning staff are happy to clean. They were literally at our door like clockwork throughout our stay asking when they could come in to clean - no lie. Oh, and the towels. I'm usually at the first desk begging for a clean decent towel - not at Mandalay Bay. While the towels aren't heaven soft or super luxurious, as is the case with most hotels these days, we had enough towels to last us two whole days without requesting replacements. So you couldn't imagine my shock when I looked under the sink and discovered extra towels. I nearly fell over. I was at a lost as to how I could use so many towels. The large flat screen plasma TV in the room was nice, but I was furious that there were not a single movie channel. I'm just accustomed to having at least one movie channel at any hotel I stay at but I guess this being Las Vegas they don't expect guests to be in their room watching movies. I didn't get a chance to eat at their buffet but my friend wouldn't shut up the whole time about how excellent the food was. We did eat at Red White Blue and enjoyed the food. It must be a popular place too because most times we walked by there was a line out the door. My friend also went to the Rumjungle and kept saying how it was a very cool place. The hotel casino area is very tastefully done and more relaxed than the other casinos on the strip. Compared to the other hotels and casinos Mandalay Bay is definitely the best. I couldn't stand all the crowds, noise, smoke and hype of the other places. Due to it's location at the Southern end of the strip you don't have to deal with the crap that comes along with the other hotels. No gridlock surrounding the hotel, no loud drunken folk, no nonsense. At the end of each day when I was done visiting each of the other places I was happy to return to the peace and quiet at Mandalay Bay. At first I was disappointed I wasn't staying at TheHotel until I discovered how overrated it is - very overrated. And no, I'm not some old geezer either. My friend and I are both young crazy guys in our 20s who thought we made a very bad choice picking this hotel when we first walked in but now can't stop raving about how much we loved our stay.

We had previously stayed at Mandalay Bay but this was our first experience with TheHotel. For a hotel of this caliber there were some problems. The good: hotel staff, with the exception of one front desk person and manager, were all very friendly and seemed eager to please. Suites are roomy. Rooms were always cleaned before we returned each afternoon. The bad: Robes were missing from the room. Kleenex could not be found in either bathroom. Housekeeping was called and this was taken care of. Room service was ordered approximately six times during the visit and only 2 orders were completed without leaving anything out. Ex. muffin for breakfast was forgotten, whipped cream for fruit was left out, etc. The rooms are dark to provide a relaxing feel but I thought they were a little TOO dark to apply makeup, etc., even after turning on all the lights. The ugly: There was a definite smell in the bathroom and pool areas. It may be that Vegas is short on water and using treated water? I don't know, but there is definately an unpleasant smell that interferes with the sense of relaxation. It seemed that the hotel scents the air with coconut but even outside by the pool you still get whiffs of treated water that spoil the experience. My daughter and I both had stomach cramps and diarrhea and wonder if it had something to do with the water. Lastly, I left my purse in the bathroom by the pool and the person who found it called to say she returned the purse to the front desk (she used my cell phone that was with my purse and dialed the last number, my husband's phone). What a wonderful person! BUT when I went to the front desk to get my purse back the clerk blew me off and told me to go to \"lost and found\" at Security. I hiked back out to the casino area only to be told they did not have my purse either. I was very upset and emotional. When I went back to the front desk a manager was brought because I was crying. Suddenly my purse appeared and there was no apology given for sending me on a wild goose chase. As I turned away the manager said, \"it was a pleasure\". Huh? This hotel definately has potential if they can fix the water/smell problem and train their managers in customer service. The friendliness of the rest of the staff almost made up for the little things missed but I would not stay here again until the larger problems are fixed.", "Date": "June 16, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cincinnati", "Title": "\u201cAlready off to a bad start...\u201d", "Author": "LVGamblers", "ReviewID": "UR16937284", "Content": "Booked a king, strip view room in April, paid in advance, and got an e-mail a couple of days ago telling me I've been \"transfered\" to MGM.

We were so impressed with our first time that we had to come back. We were not let down. We arrived May 26th at 11:15AM. I was prepared to have to wait a few hours to get to our room, since check-in time is usually 3:00PM. Not the case though. The check in clerk was EXTREMELY friendly, honored all of my room requests, and had the room ready for us in abot a half hour. We simpy had a drink in the lounge while we waited. I will say that the line to check in seemed a bit long at first glance, but it moved quickly, and there was an employee greeting guests in the line and directing them to the next available check-in agent. All in all, a good check-in experience and we were settled in our room by noon. The Hotel still looks and SMELLS GREAT!! The moment you enter the lobby, there is this wonerful aroma everywhere. Some people may not like it I suppose, but my boyfriend and I cant resist it. The room hallways are immaculate; occasionally you'll find a room service tray on the floor, but that happens in any hotel with room service, and housekeeping is quick to remove it. The room looked just like it did the last time we stayed, which is wonderful. Personally, I think its a very classy, well done room. The only difference with this stay from our last is that we had a king size bed this time in a corner suite, which was pretty nice. I agree with some previous reviews that the wear and tear on some of the furniture is becoming noticeable. For instance, our living room tables had a few chips here and there. I guess its a matter of opinion, but for me it is nothing to complain about. Any hotel of this size is gonna see some wear and tear, including the Bellagio or Venetian or any other classy hotel. Regardless, the room looked great, very clean, AMAZING BATHROOM with lots of marble, I loved it. Beware of the mini bar, its stocked with lots of nice liquors that aren't free, lol. The casino at Mandalay Bay still looks nice, as does the pool. The pool was still as crowded as ever, but they, its a great pool complex with a wave pool and lazy river. It's the best pool area I've seen in Vegas. Drinks are still running about $12 a piece for any frozen concoctions. I also found the waitress service by the pool very good this time. One other thing I will note, we went to the BATH HOUSE SPA this time, it was WONDERFUL!! We both had Swedish massages and were very satisfied. We will definitely be going back. Overall, The Hotel at Mandalay is a great place in our opinion. Very classy with that cosmopolitan feel, and its a good value for the money. We go to Vegas at least once a year, and I'm debating whether or not to book The Hotel again simply because I really want to stay at the new City Center complex that nearing completion. It will be a tough choice, but either way I reamin a loyal fan of this hotel.", "Date": "June 7, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego, CA", "Title": "\u201cVery, very nice, would go back anytime.\u201d", "Author": "psmconnor", "ReviewID": "UR16708869", "Content": "Stayed for 3 nights in May.

After waiting in line for half an hour, my husband and I finally get to the check-in desk where we are told that we either have a choice of a queen bed or a handicapped room. Of course we had booked a king size room. We said that was unacceptable, and asked for a manager. The clerk vanished for at least 15 minutes and magically a king size room appeared. She was rude and incompetent and only spoke to my husband, as if I was invisible. Same issue when we called to ask for a late checkout. We were told no, asked for a manager, and magically yet once again, it became available. It is quite obvious that they simply train their employees to reject every request, and only to capitulate if the people demand a manager. What a joke of a customer service policy. Literally every person we came in contact there was just plain rude- and I live in Manhattan, so that is really saying something. And I've saved the best for last. When making the reservation, my husband asked if they would comp a cabana. The person said sure, as long as there was availability. When we arrived, we asked again, and told the same thing. The word \"comp\" must have been used at least 5 times in various conversations with VIP services, the cabana people, etc. When we went to the pool area, we were lead to our cabana that \"VIP services had reserved\" for us. We were not given a price list, a choice of cabanas, NOTHING. Lo and behold a $400 dollar charge appears on the bill. When we called VIP services, the \"manager\" there, Brett Jones, consistent with their wonderful customer service we had experienced thus far accused my husband of making up the fact that we were assured the cabana would be comped. He said that we were lying, and regardless, they reserved the right to deny comps to anyone at any time, so even if we were promised that it would be free, because he wasn't satisfied with our level of play, he was taking it away. It totally ruined our day- to be taken advantage of like that-we made every reasonable point that rational people would, and he was just awful. Sure the cabana was lovely, but we certainly would not have paid $400 for the privilege of using a little hut by the pool for a few hours. My husband called again later that day, asked to speak to another manager, and this person \"split the difference\" with him. So we were charged $200 against our will for something we were assured numerous times, by numerous employees of The Hotel would be free. It is simply not right.

My wife and I expected to be told that we couldn't check in until later, but no, to my surprise they said that they had smoking/king rooms available right now. The check in ladies were extremely nice and amazing, however that was the highlight of our The Hotel experience. We arrived up in our smoking room and didn't even have to light up to get hit in the face with a powerful aroma of stale smoke, but who am I to complain, I smoke. Next I went to put our valuables in the safe so that we could hit the town, unfortunately the safe had been locked by the previous guest and I had to call security to open it. The room was very hot so I turned down both thermostats and we left. When we came back, we noticed that the room was very hot again. I figured out that the thermostats where configured to set back to 72 (which was really more like 76) after a couple hours. This was a constant pain during our 2 night stay. Every time we woke up or came back to the room it was roasting. I don't keep my home at that level of heat and I certainly wouldn't expect a nice hotel that cost a couple hundred a night to dictate my comfort level. The final let down of the room was the bed. I woke up numerous times throughout the night with a spring in my side. The matress was so firm and wore out that we slept horribly both nights. The views from The Hotel are also not the greatest. We had a view of the parking structure and the Mandalay pool, but it was pretty far away and not really that enjoyable. I found the couch to be kind of disgusting. It was fabric and looked like many stains had been cleaned off of it. Also the chair for the desk was something that my cheap office would throw out in the dumpster. The tv was poor quality analog. I have no idea why they put LCD tv's throughout the room and have horribly split analog channels. Another thing my wife noticed was that the living room was actually smaller than the bedroom. We would have preferred more living space in the suite, as opposed to wasted space in the bedroom. Well, hopefully The Hotel will remodel their rooms soon. They are in desperate need. My brother visited The Hotel about 4 or 5 years ago and he said that it was really nice. My wife and I didn't agree on this trip, but would be willing to give it a try again if they remodeled. Overall, I think I would just rather stay at the Mandalay if I wanted to be South-strip. There was no fridge in our room, no high definition tv, bad bed and a gross couch.

We were allowed to check in early(11.00am) we were given a high floor (35) and a strip view room which we had to pay $20 supplement per night.Rooms were very spacious very clean,bathrooms are well appointed with a huge bath and glass shower with seperate toilet. We had two queen beds and to be honest I was a little disappointed with quality of sheets and very standard bath robes and slippers. Even though the hotel was a definate sanctuary from the noise and glitz of the casinos after the first day it became very apparent at how darkly lit the rooms were even with every light on it was still quite dark. A massive plus point for he Hotel is the Mix Lounge on the top floor fantastic view of the strip and has to match the Ghost bar for wow factor we found it less pretentious than the Ghost Bar and always got a table on the outdoor terrace between 7-10pm before they introduce bottle service only.

The past couple of years we have been staying a Caesars' Augustus Tower, but due to the current construction we decided to try this place. Glad we did. Thought it was great. Check in was easy, only waited about 5 minutes. And that was at 3:00PM. I requested an upper floor with a Strip view and got it. I told them I was concerned about the noise from the Mix club that I read about here, and asked for a \"quiet\" room. They gave me a room on the 36th floor underneath the Club's open balcony. So I was a bit concerned. But with the A/C on, we never heard a thing. From either the club or the rooms next to us. The Suite room was wonderful, but I won't go into great detail since the previous reviews on this website have given such a great description. Just let me say that having a living room separated from the bedroom was nicer than I expected. While the lighting was a little poor, we didn't think it was a big problem. We thought Housekeeping did a great job. We left the room every day around 9:00 or 10:00AM and returned around 2:00 or 3:00PM. The room was made up before our return every day. We never actually saw the housekeeping staff. That's a good staff. Our one complaint would be that the pool area at Mandalay is way too overcrowded. We stayed there around 6 years ago, and it was not that bad. This time there were herds of people everywhere. Many without lounge chairs after 11:00AM. But more people just kept coming in. After the first morning there, we decided to try the adults-only Moorea Beach Club. Worth the $50 entry fee they charge guys ($10 for women). It was a whole different world there. Gorgeous waitresses, a DJ, comfortable padded lounge chairs, a bar steps from the pool, and a hip, younger crowd. We went there every other day too. Tried both spas (The Hotel and Mandalay). Liked the one at Mandalay much better. Larger with more lounge chairs. The BathHouse spa at The Hotel only had 5 lounge chairs in the entire place. We had massages at The Bathhouse though and thought they were great. All the restaurants we went to in Mandalay, The Hotel, and the Four Seasons were incredible. But I will review them individually. All in all, we loved our stay at The Hotel and highly recommend it. It ranks well against our previous stays at Caesars, Wynn, Bellagio. As long as you pay the extra for the private beach club. The regular pool area at Mandalay is just too much of a hassle. Besides, even being at the Beach Club still gives you access to the Mandalay's wave pool and lazy river, the best features there anyway.", "Date": "May 15, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Scotland", "Title": "\u201cLuxury suites - but no 5 star experience\u201d", "Author": "Megaflyer", "ReviewID": "UR16023284", "Content": "Sorry to be a bit negative about my experience here but this is not a comparative review, as I haven\u2019t stayed at any other Las Vegas hotels. However I researched as best I could with the help of reviews on Trip Advisor and this appeared to best suit my requirements. I want others to know what to expect to avoid similar disappointment. THE Hotel at Mandalay Bay is in a separate tower to the main hotel. Also housed within this tower on the upper floors is The Four Seasons hotel, although you wouldn\u2019t really know it, as it has a separate entrance and public areas. The suites are beautifully furnished in a contemporary style, although the chocolate coloured walls make them feel smaller and a little gloomy. The Philips plasma television in the living room looked very dated and it seemed penny pinching and pointless that it be mounted in a cabinet rather than straight onto the wall. The large sofa doubled up as an extra single bed and it was very comfortable. However, it was very difficult trying to get housekeeping to make this up as a bed each evening. There is a nice bar area but contents of the mini bar are too expensive and it could not be used to store ones own drinks. No ice available other than through room service. Expect to wait 30 minutes for ice and 90 minutes if you want food \u2013 that is a total joke in what purports to be a luxury hotel. There is a second toilet off the living room, very good if an extra person sleeping on sofa. The bedroom had two queen sized beds \u2013 very comfortable but not exceptional. The television was once again built into furniture and was old fashioned (not flat panel). The bathroom was probably the most impressive part of the suite: truly large with an enormous wide and deep bathtub, separate shower cubicle and twin sinks. A novel feature that I haven\u2019t previously seen were the lights, which when turned on were very dim and automatically gradually brightened, quite useful during the night. So all told the quality of the suite was very good and, apart from the televisions, would rate 5 star. Now I will explain why this apparently high quality property caused such disappointment. Firstly the sheer size of the operation means that residents feel totally anonymous. It is probably virtually impossible to experience five star service in such a large establishment and I expect this is a common feature of many of the Las Vegas hotels. The thing that had swung me most in favour of this property was the supposed wonderful pool areas. Well at first glance the pool areas seem impressive. The problem is that once such areas are filled with literally thousands of people it takes on the feel of a busy water park or a crowded beach (think Benidorm) with no escape from the masses of people and worst of all, no escape from the mindless, bass-thumping, mediocre music being pumped out throughout the whole area. There are at least five pools but even though one was slightly removed from the others and with fewer sunbathers, the same music was piped there to ensure it was utterly impossible to achieve any sort of quiet relaxation. These hotel companies are supposed to know their target customer, so I\u2019m afraid this hotel is not aimed at me, nor a huge number of other people who want to relax in peace and quiet. Perhaps the idea that anyone who wants the excitement of Vegas could also want relaxation has never occurred to them. Having decided to forget the pool area altogether, salt was rubbed into the wound on my way back to the room when I spotted a lovely pool that was quiet and relaxing and music free, only to discover a sign advising that it was exclusively reserved for residents at The Four Seasons, admission by room key card only. So perhaps there is the answer: pay the extra if you want a true five star experience, because you won\u2019t get it here.

We drove in from San Diego and were confused as to where to check in. We received directions from a valet at the Mandalay Hotel who told us how to get to The Hotel. We wanted to unload our car and park it ourselves. However, there is ONLY valet parking. The valet allowed us to leave it at the entrance for \"5 minutes\" while we checked in. The hostess who checked us in was very friendly, but my father who was very stressed about his car was not in the mood for small talk and just wanted his credit card so he could run out to move the car. Also, when we first walked in from the parking garage to check in, the signage is scarce. It was frustrating originally because we couldn't even FIND the check in area. After I checked in, I appreciated the layout and minimalizm of the hotel lobby. My room was 60-804. I loved it. I asked about a smoking room and was told that I could choose to smoke or not. I don't smoke, however there was an ashtray and matches in my room. I never felt as tho I was in a \"smoking room\". I had 2 closets and 6 drawers. 2 of my family members stayed in suites and complained that they had only 1 small closet. The bathroom is the biggest I've ever stayed in. There were 4 places for the soap. I felt lonely staying there with 2 seperate sinks, large shower, a bathtub that was at least 5 feet long with jacuzzi jets, separate toilet room, and a mirror that every woman loves. My family stayed in 5 other separate rooms. I heard no complaints other that the small closet space in the suites. My children and I loved the pool area. 5 different ones to choose and all good! I love the theme of THE hotel. As soon as you leave the elevator, you have THE STORE, THE COFFEE BAR, THE CAFE, THE LOBBY, THE LOUNGE. The Cafe was wonderful for breakfast. Subtle lighting and comfortable chairs, food was good. The Lounge was used for us to just meet in while waiting for other family to appear. We were able to move the large leather chairs around to fit our group. We were never approached to buy a drink,etc.. I went into THE STORE and asked for the cheapest bottle of wine. The African American lady went through all the prices with me and helped me choose. When I inquired about purchasing a cork screw she told me they were in all the rooms. I had to call the front desk and was told cork screws were in the mini bars. I had no mini bar but took it from my sister who did. I love how you can walk easily into the LUXOR and from there into the EXCALIBAR. My sister-in-law paid $30 for the day at THE SPA. She went in the morning and loved it so much went back in the evening. This was my first trip to Vegas. I visited the Stratospere, New York New York, Excaliber, Luxor. I was impressed my the classiness of THE HOTEL. I would stay there again in a second. I recommend THE HOTEL.

The flight was quick/painless. Airport- Immediately out of the front doors, there are aggressive \"salesperson(s)\" hawking limos/etc. Quite nice, convenient, but about $80 for a normal limo(goes up from there) to Mandalay. Past the limo area, are regular taxis services, for the price of about $15. Choice is yours, either way it tis a quick trip to Mandalay(one can see the hotel from the airport on the way in). Arrival/Check in - Again, large line, but moved quite quickly, as staff coordinated the line into about 15 different service/check in bays. Rooms were a tad unorganized, as I was in a group of 4 total guys, and wanted adjoining rooms. After changing my room once, was able to have connecting rooms through the room doors which was nice. No real issues here, staff quite accommodating. Rooms - Vegas rooms! Plasma 42\" television, safe, with plenty of room. The upper levels(34 floors) have awesome views, both in the day time and at night. Mine had a view of the airport/MGM. The other side faces onto the pool area. Clean, well maintained. The fridge bar has beer, with each being (?) $6, which is cheap as the bars cost $8-10. There are close liquor stores is that\u2019s your bag as well. Hotel - VAST casino, with both high end black jack/poker tables, as well as the \"low end\". The low end black jack is about $15 minimum, with the higher end ones about $100 min bet. Lots of slots etc, no lines ever. The resort is nice, well put together, but friggin huge. It took me at least 2 days to understand the layout. The hotels are all connected, either through pedestrian walkways, or LRT/Trains. Mandalay connects to the Luxor(black pyramid). Here are the IMAX theatres, and of course more gambling. My issues was the prices of course, tis not like the Vegas of old. Food is pricey, even in the food courts. I wanted to work out at the gym one morning, but even there they charge $30 just for the drop in fee to the gym. Pool - Very Very nice, but busy. All days we were there, the pool was packed, and finding chairs was onerous, but was able to usually find 4 chairs in a row with a bit of work. There is the \"public pool\", and then the \"private\" pools. Private just means you pay more, then have access to them. There is one topless area which is hidden by walls. I think the extra drop in cost for the private pools is about $80/day. There is a good Mexican style restaurant just outside the pool, and a grill inside the pool with good food/portions(about $12). There is a lazy rivers inside as well. Plenty of lifeguards, as well as a nice children swim style side of the pool. The actual pool has a wave maker which is fun. Bars - I went to several, the best being Hardrock Cafe(10 min cab ride, $15). The Palms hotel has a cool bar on the top floor one should see, as it opens up on a cat walk overlooking the city which was awesome to see. Mandalay itself has several bars, which were also good. Went to the Moon bar, the Playboy bar(ashamed to say-ha, was cheesy), and the Mix. All the above bars were huge and damn loud. The only bar I went to that one could see others around, and be able to hear others was at the Hardrock(several additional bars within Hardrock). Prices in all about 8-10 dollars per drink. Flight back- delayed 1 hr, but hey, that\u2019s airlines for you. There are restaurants inside the Vegas departure area, so there is plenty to do when leaving Vegas and awaiting your departure. *all in all, a good trip. Not sure if I\u2019ll do it again, as I prefer the all inclusive Caribbean style resorts, but was fun.

I worked for the Ritz Carlton for years and am a pretty picky traveler. So, here's my assessment. THE HOTEL only has suites which makes it the best room for the money \"hands down\" on the strip for this caliber of hotel. Valet parking is easy to access and puts you really close to the room elevators, no long walks through or around casinos. I'd call down before I left my room each time and my car was there waiting for me. The valets also give you a nice chilled complimentary bottle of water (most others do not). The room is plush, a TV in each room, wet bar for your snacks, a mini-fridge for your drinks. You can ask them to remove the honor bar items so you can utilize the entire fridge and not be tempted by the pricey snacks. Amenities include terry cloth sandals (one pair each for men and women), chenille robes, primo bath products in apothecary style jars complete with bath salts, to fill the enormous bathtub. The tub is uber- deep, like a Japanese soaker tub, big enough for two people to lie down side by side in. The waterfall like faucet fills the tub in no time. You can watch TV from the tub as well. Floor to ceiling windows to offer a great view of the strip (had to pay $20 extra a night for that but worth it). Good soundproofing, never heard a thing. Plenty of drawer and closet space. Housekeeping was spotty. If you plan on going out for the afternoon or evening, call down and ask them to make up your room. The pool gets rated highly but that only makes it the place to go to, meaning....big crowds. Even with the massive pool area and amount of chairs, the place stays packed from the moment it opens its gates. They have a ton of cabanas which are reserved months in advance. If you plan to spend the day out there and are with at least 4 people, pony up and get one, it's worth it to have chairs and a spot to call your own. Plus you can bring your own food and drinks and not pay $8 for a beer. But the place is clean, decent pool food and the wave pool is pretty nice, I have to admit. Bring a water noodle or blowup tube for the lazy river. Theirs are $25 a day and too big to use on the narrow river. Go to Walgreens and get a cheap one you can toss at the end of the trip. The restaurants range from fair to fantastic, do your homework before you get there. But for the money, I'd opt for one of the restaurants at the Bellagio or Wynn that offer outdoor dining or views. The fountains or waterfall (at Wynn) offer great scenery with your meal. Room service was boring, nothing special, portions are small (by in-room dining standards). The shop downstairs is much smaller than most other hotels and has a limited selection of food and drinks. There are drug stores up and down the strip that are all open 24/7 for supplies. The coffee shop in th elobby is a must since the Starbucks always has a long line and runs out of items by noon. Check-in was painless, I never saw any lines. The concierge staff were young and not very experienced. Girls that are size 0 are not going to know where to eat but they will know where to go clubbing. Yeah, its at the end of the strip but also not in the high traffic areas and easy to get in and out of if you have a car. If you have any doubts, rent a car. Every hotel offers free valet parking, the buses are super slow and taxis are really expensive. One taxi ride up the strip will run you about $25 on a Saturday night. The car rental is about that much for a day and you can bounce back and forth at your leisure. Overall, the only other hotel that is better is the Wynn and their rooms are smaller. This hotel is contemporary, trendy but not too hip and a nice boutique hotel in a big complex.

We were on the 25th floor and we can still hear the Mix late at night but it wasn't too overwhelming. If you want some peace and quiet ask for a lower floor. Definitely take your child to Shark's Reef! It's well worth the admission. The Noodles restaurant was the most authentic Chinese restaurant that I've had in Vegas. We've eaten at the Chinese restaurant in Bellagio (Jasmines), NYNY(ChinChin), Changs and SamWoo in Chinatown and they were all just brutal.

The Bathhouse gym has no windows, just neon 80s style lights while the Spa Mandalay gym has open windows and is really bright. I think that Spa Mandalay is definitely better.

I have stayed at several of the \"better\" hotels on the strip and I am partial to Mandalay Bay for many reasons- we decided to give THE Hotel a try because we were able to get a great rate for a suite, which was a must as we were traveling with three kids. When we arrived to check in, we were told that our room would be ready in about 1 hour, 2 hours max. We were waiting for more family members to arrive and had not yet eaten lunch, so we killed some time in TheCafe. The food was delicious and the service was great. We visited with family for a bit and after an hour and a half had lapsed, we checked with the front desk to see if the room was ready yet. They told us it would be another 2-3 hours! We had a wedding to attend that evening and this would have been just absolutely impossible for us...putting us in our rooms with our bags just an hour before the wedding was set to start. After some cajoling, they offered us a different room on a different floor (allegedly an upgrade, but looked exactly the same as the 'regular' room our family had) and $100 in credit for food/bev at either hotel. Fine. To make a long story short, the room was even further delayed- according to the desk clerk, the people before us had \"left a humongous mess\" (greeeeeeeat. just what you want to hear). As a result, they also offered to upgrade us to a \"V Corner Suite\" the following night. We accepted. Overall, the hotel is clean, elegant and a refreshingly quiet change of pace from your typical smoky Vegas casino-style hotel. You are not assaulted by flashing lights and dinging slot machines the moment you walk in. The valets are very personable and will try to address you by name and remember the details of what you are doing in Vegas that weekend (How was the wedding Mrs. so-and-so?). The bell staff was fast and efficient and friendly, although on our departure, they forgot to come and get our bags- we wound up just bringing them down ourselves, no biggie. The mini-bar prices were surprisingly modest- about the same as the hotel gift shop \"TheStore\" lol...which was nice. The furnishings were in good shape and were of nice quality. In essence, everything was as it should be for such an establishment. My one word of caution would be to avoid the extra expense of the \"V Suite\". We were switched a total of 3 times between the standard \"The Suite\", the upgraded \"The Suite\" and the \"Corner V Suite\" and there wasn't any appreciable difference.

Talk about overrated. Where to start...hmmm... 1. I will start with check-in. Took 30 minutes to check-in. We had two people in front of us. I should rephrase that statement. It took 30 minutes of standing in line before we reached the front desk. After that it took an additional 15 minutes. Why? I have no idea. We checked in at the Mandalay Bay rather than TheHotel. The front desk person gave us the wrong directions to Thehotel. 2. The room was dirty. The bedspread had a greasy handprint on it, neither of the two 42-inch plasma TVs worked very well, the glasses in the bathroom were filthy and the light fixture in the closet was a small bulb hanging by its wires. The toilets are a joke. They barely flush their own water. I guess Mandalay is trying to save money wherever they can. The entire hotel is done in cheap plastic. I would expect more from a so-called 5-star hotel. 3. Why do they charge you for the bottles of water and snacks in the room? When I stay in an upscale suite that is usually complimentary. I guess Mandalay needs more money to purchase more cheap fixtures. 4. Now to the buffet. Lmao...$26.99 for some basic food? No lobster, shrimp, oysters etc... All you get are some cheap steaks, mashed potatoes, pizza, ham, egg rolls and rolls. Big deal! Stay away from the Bayside Buffet at Mandalay Bay. 5. One of the machines ate my $100 bill. It took 25 minutes for a technician to arrive. I even had to ask another employee at one of the desks to call for assistance. In all, everything is overpriced. The environment is cheaply done and poorly maintained. I would never refer to this as a 5-star hotel. My stay at the California hotel was more enjoyable. My advice is to stay far away from Mandalay Bay.

Overall the hotel is OK, although there are some objective disadvantages like the location at the very end of the Strip. Which means, you either take a taxi all time when you want to go to a different place like for dinner, or you walk for more than 20 minutes. I personally disliked the smell of the hotel. They use some special kind of perfume all over the place that put me off. Also, although rather new, the rooms (I stayed in 2 different) show signs of wear and tear. Don't believe what their website says. I reserved a suite with \"enticing views\". In fact they gave me a room on the 6th floor with enticing views of a parking space and a highway. I complained and, on the next day, could switch to a different room where the view was better, but far from \"enticing\". Also the switching was done in a very unprofessional way and required us to wait for hours and remind them 3 times. The views were important to me, because I got married in Las Vegas , so I went through with it. On my wedding day I made special arrangements, like Champagne and flowers in the room after our return from the Chapel. They ignored every single one of them -- so no Champagne, no flowers :-( -- and did not even clean the room. I had been down at the front desk in the morning and specifically arranged for them to make up the room while we were away and was told, it would be no problem.

This is Vegas, so this is not going to be quiet elegance, but The Hotel gives in ways that many Vegas properties do not. The Service--Not so much here. The only hotel in LV that seems keen on service is the Four Seasons. Here we find business as usual. Rushed staff, little attention to detail, and perfunctory treatment all around. Now, let's be clear, I was not abused by anyone, but nobody went out of their way. The Environment--The lobby has a very strange layout. It is as if the architects wanted to create a maze, rather than a clear sense of space. That being said, there is marble everywhere and unlike gaudier properties (pace, The Venetian), there is some understatement here, which I liked. Also, the lobby has some terrific art. Great prints by folks such as Richard Serra, Jasper Johns, and Robert Rauschenberg. I especially like the two huge Rauschenbergs printed by ULAE that are near the reception desk. The Location--We are not at the center of the Strip here; in fact, we are from it. Also, remember, taxis are a plenty, but an annoying expense in Vegas. The Room--We had a standard room, which is a two-room suite with a 1/2 bath in the living room. I liked this for its comfort and ample space. The beds were comfortable (in fact, even the roll-away bed was terrific!). The bathrooms were quite large and while three flat-screen tvs seems a bit much, it's Vegas, so why not? The Pool--Crazy water park fun, which would be great for kids. The Gym--Small, cramped, and expensive! Yes, plenty of equipment, but we need some of the tvs from the guest rooms in this space! The Bars and Restaurants--The food was tasty. I liked the breakfast in the main restaurant. Great corn beef hash. Concierge--They seemed to be there at their desks, but I was not sure what their job was beyond surfing the Internet. Overall--I would suggest this hotel for comfort and ease. While not centered around the chaos of the Strip, it is definitely a hotel that I will stay in again.

Same pool, same restaurants and nothing exclusive. Also, the atmosphere was very dark and sterile.

The adjoining bedroom has a wall length piece of furniture that house another plasma drawers and two closets for clothing. The bed was comfortable, but the pillows far too soft.

Staff were pleasant but did nothing out the way as you would expect in a higher end property. The Tuesday night of my stay the property lost power and I was stranded in my room for nearly two hours. I quickly learned that they were able to power the casino - but not the sleeping rooms or elevators. I was expecting a note under my door the next morning appologizing for any inconvience. That never happened - which is too bad they had a great opportunity to have a service recovery and blew it. When I made issue with the clerk as I checked out I was given a slip of paper with the electric company's phone number. On my last night after being on the trade show floor for 4 days I decided to stay in and order room service. I was quoted 45 minutes - 80 minutes it arrived and it was cold. They did replace it within 20 minutes and the charge did not appear on my bill so they get credit for that. Overall I would say that if you get the room for a cheap price - give it a try.

My husband had a conference in the Mandalay Bay convention center so we stayed in The Hotel because we had read such great reviews of The Hotel on Trip Advisor. The entrance to The Hotel is separate from the Mandalay Bay entrance but it is easy walking distance to the casino and other restaurants. It is also easily located near Mandalay Place so you can walk to Luxor within just 5 minutes or so. It is quieter in The Hotel but there were a lot of kids since it was Spring Break week. There was even a kid on a unicycle coming out of the elevator with the rest of the family. A freaking unicycle! What the heck is that about? The restaurants are expensive, but then again it feels like everything is on the rise in Vegas. I noticed a lot of activities and clubs did not get going until 10pm or later. We had dinner at the Mix one night, great atmosphere but the food was not that great. Very small portions and I had the Surf and Turf. The surf was halibut and the Turf was duck. The duck was marinated in a very strange sauce that left me feeling like it had soured. The halibut was very good but the brussel sprouts were tough. I gambled about $2000 the first day and went to the Player's Club the next morning to see how I was doing and maybe score some tickets to a show or something. They said I was gambling enough to have a LITTLE ( not all) of my food comped ( we charge all food and drinks to the room) but no show tickets. The tickets they had were to Mama Mia in the $110 seats. They said I was not even close to scoring those. That blew me away and I kept wondering the rest of the trip , how much do you have to gamble and for how long to get some $100 show tickets? Needless to say I did not gamble much after that in the casino. I just did not feel important and I was bored in the casino. There were tons of penny machines! I am a Dollar or Quarter slot player, and i was not happy with the selection. My husband played backjack and found the dealers to be friendly but were older than we had seen at other hotels. The cocktail waitresses looked bored, tired and had very little energy and walked by so quickly I just skipped trying to get a coke or a coffee. Oh yeah only Pepsi in this hotel, no coke products. I don't drink but I have a feeling if you drink you would probably enjoy this hotel. I saw a lot of people talking in small groups in the lounges and they all looked like they were having fun. The room was spacious, clean, contemporary, lots of great toiletries, a full size regular hairdryer, 2 sinks, 2 bathrooms, sitting room and beds. 725 square feet and we faced the strip. Excellent view. We checked in at 10 am and the room was not ready until 11:30am. Ask for a coupon booklet, great coupons! I would probably stay here again but would use the pool/beach and spa next time. Gambling was just ok, kind of boring. Lounges and restaurants look good if you are ready to blow some cash.

The entrance is adjacent to the parking structure and right next to it is the back entrance to mandalay bay restaurants and casino which is really convenient. Right upon entering there was this really pleasant smell in the hotel and the decor was very modern and chic. Woman at check in was older and she said the highest available with king was on the 7th floor (which i really doubt) and she seemed a bit surprised that two women wanted one king over two queens... no view but our room was right next to elevator.

Rooms are a great size at 725sqft and i really appreciate the extra bath (toilet and sink) in the room right at the entrance in addition to the large bathroom with the tub that could comfortably fit two people... they even provide bath powder.

We originally visited Las Vegas in September 2007 and like it so much decided to come back for some more Vegas fun. What we liked: Room Layout: We've stayed in regular rooms at both Bellagio and Wynn, and neither comes close to the layout of TheHOTEL. Nice marble entry way with attached washroom, small living room with couch, chair, desk, wet-bar, and flat screen TV and DVD player. Super large bedroom with a very comfortable bed and tons of storage space (great for the aftermath from shopping expeditions), and easily the nicest bathroom of the three hotels in Vegas we've stayed at ~ and that's saying something, Bellagio and Wynn are certainly no slouches. The bathroom, much like the suite itself, is huge as our each of its amenities (bath and shower in particular). Overall, the suite layout makes your stay here very comfortable. Other nice touches included the ipod dock, lighted do not disturb and cleaning signs, and great smelling bathroom amenities. Room Location: Face it, with many hotels in Vegas you can spend most of your vacation walking from your room to the car parking lot. Ok, maybe not half your vacation but certainly 10-15 minutes each way (e.g. Bellagio). Not so with TheHOTEL. On average we walked from our car to our room in about 3 minutes. You wouldn't think this was a big deal ~ but overtime you really start to appreciate it. Amenities: There are plenty of good places to eat within walking distance. Its great to have a Starbucks on-site. The Burger Bar offers excellent value for money. Mama Mia is good value, entertaining, show. There is also a good convenience store in the lobby. Location: This is both a pro and con of TheHOTEL. The pro is that you can easily get to the hotel by car without dealing with Strip traffic. On the other hand, walking to the center or north strip from this hotel is a work-out, given its southern location. However, there is a free tram to luxor/excalibur which makes the rest of the south end strip hotels (such as Monte Carlo and MGM Grand) easily accessible by foot. What we didn't like: Cleanliness: Overall, the room was dusty ~ maybe its the dark lighting, or all the glass covered, dark wood, furniture, or the fact that cleaning staff have much bigger rooms to clean (and therefore one assume less time) but the room really needed a good dusting. There was also a stain on the comforter and a hair in the bathroom which took away from the stunning layout of the suite. The walk to the pool: The con of being so close to the parking lot is that your a good 5-10 minute walk to the pool via the Mandalay Bay's smokey Casino. The Lobby: To be honest there is not much here. It almost seems like an afterthought. On the other hand we didn't mind, it just meant we got to our car faster. Of Interest: We found the front desk staff were friendly. We arrived early (around 11 am) and they had a room that fitted our requests (king bed, non-smoking, strip-view, high floor) ready by 1pm. When we checked out they waived the internet usage charge which was appreciated. Overall: The good definitely outweighs the bad here, this is a worthy accommodation experience fitting of Las Vegas.

They excuse was that they couldn't control the disco and they couldn;t control smoking or should I say they indivduals who disobey rules. Although I could not say anything further bad about the hotel because it;s very nice and the staff is very polite and effiicent. I think that the hotel should step upto the disco problem and open some other night spot without that kind of noise. If you can hear 30 floors below you can imagine how loud it is. As far as the smoking I do not blame the hotel I blame the rules, all hotels should have check out rule of one night charge of smoking in a non-smoking room. Just the threat will stop it. I am tired of checking to hotel were they use room deoderizer to tried to mask the smell.

The entrance to the parking lot is right at the entrace to the hotel and the elevators are a short walk (unlike the distance to the elevators of Mandalay). Since we rented a car, the location was no problem for us and we actually liked the fact that we dealt with less traffic closer to the hotel. The room was absolutely beautiful and spacious. One downside was that we had requested a king size bed in our reservation and got two queens with our new room. This was a minor setback as we were so impressed with the room to begin with. The bed was extremely comfortable and I liked being able to charge my iPod in the dock on the night stand. The bathroom was a nice size and we especially liked the flat screen TV. It was great to get ready while being able to watch the news or other morning program. The bathroom amenities were also a plus and I liked being given a regular hair dryer rather that a wall unit to use. The view from the room was great through the floor to ceiling windows however at night with all the lights on, the reflection makes it impossible to see outside.

In less than 5 years I have gone from the Excalibur to the Luxor to the Mandalay Bay and now to THE Hotel. I've stayed at THE Hotel twice and am going for the third time in August. This is simply the best hotel I have ever stayed in. The crowd is hip and sophisticated, no screaming kids, no trashy tourists, no walking through a casino to get to your room, etc. I simply park in the garage and go right up to my room. It's a completely different type of Vegas experience. I prefer a low-key, relaxing atmosphere and THE Hotel provides that. I am happy going from my room to the car or the the fantastic pool at Mandalay Bay. I also enjoy eating at the Verandah restaurant at the Four Seasons (best kept secret - I feel guilty even mentioning it!). A lot of people will say \"Who cares about the hotel room when you're in Vegas? It's not like you spend any time there!\" I disagree completely as I can spend hours relaxing in the beautiful THE Hotel rooms. Everything from the bedroom, living area, bathroom, etc. is top notch. I don't feel guilty at all avoiding the chaos of the strip and relaxing in the hotel room. The beds are extremely comfortable with lighting that is soft and soothing. The dark woods are calming. The toiletry products smell great, especially the body lotion. Can't say enough about THE Hotel. You really do get what you pay for and this place is worth the premium over the Mandalay Bay. You can sometimes get great deals for this hotel and it's worth every penny. I don't think I can stay anywhere else in Vegas...which is a problem but also evidence that this is one of the nicest hotels for young people in their 30s in Las Vegas. Please don't bring screaming kids to THE Hotel...go stay at Excalibur or Circus Circus. Staying at THE Hotel leaves little desire to walk the strip and dodge the tourists with their M&M store bags and their strollers.

The short story is, it's just wonderful, on nearly every level. My husband has already said he wants to stay at this hotel again next year-something he rarely voices an opinion (I'm the travel planner for the family.) That's just fine with me - I've traveled a great deal, love beautiful hotels like the Sofitel chain, etc...but few can compare to THE Hotel (I don't even mind saying the name anymore... :) As for the details: It is sparkling clean. The room begins with a lovely marble entryway, with an elegant half bath...then a generous living room, beautifully appointed, super tv and floor to ceiling windows. The hotel photos (and a couple of reviews) made me expect a darkish room with not-so-great lighting. In fact, with the drapes opened the rooms were simply flooded with light - wonderful to sit in the sunspot with coffee in the morning! Plenty of light through the windows in the evenings, too. I'll concede that the bathroom could have had slightly brighter lighting - but it was very managable. There's a fairly-good, lighted makeup mirror provided, which helps. But that is the only negative thing I can say about the bath - which was just perfect. Black marble, spacious, double sinks, sparkling clean, superdeep tub (the water spills out dramatically from a waterfall slot at the side of the tub - it's not a jacuzzi though - just a very deep tub with a neat waterspout). The toilet is in a separated room (which I like) and the soaps,etc they provide are especially nice, and refreshed throughout the visit. Attention to detail is great. Even the toilet paper had a tiny sticker at the point of the triangle, that said \"THE tp\" :) We didn't try room service - the restaurants downstairs were too convenient- the maids were nice and prompt with cleaning, as soon as we stepped out, it seemed. Front desk checkin and checkout was fast, friendly, helpful....we experienced none of the slow service described in some of the reviews. In fact, service was top notch throughout. We didn't wait for anything. As for proximity to things: I loved our location. The trek from our room on the 29th floor to the casino and restaurants of Mandalay Bay took about 5 minutes tops. If you want to head to another hotel, there is a taxi stand close to the THEHOtel registration area, and cabs were always right there. Very easy to get around. The Mandalay Bay casino is now my favorite in Vegas, because it's beautiful, easy to navigate, and I WON $2,000. with a $1.00 bet (video poker) - Wow - I'm an instructor in a small college - hardly a gambler - so this was sheer luck, and such unexpected fun. I highly recommend the video poker machines marked \"Triple Devil\" on the top-or something like that. Another thing I liked about this location - we could walk not only to the Mandalay Bay facilities, restaurants, casino...but down another fairly short hallway, lined with upscale shops, is Luxor (maybe 8-10 minutes walk from your room, if you don't stop along the way) so you have two hotels to mill around in without taking a cab anywhere. Yes, we will likely stay here if we come to Vegas next year - aside from all the above accolades, the price was less than any other one-bedroom suite of this quality in Las Vegas (we paid 169.-189. per night)....the only one to compare was Platinum...but after experiencing the convenience of being able to walk to two casinos and a total of around 18 places to eat (between MBay and the attached Luxor) we wouldn't consider a non-casino hotel now. THE Hotel was the very best of all worlds. My ONLY complaint was the lack of a coffee pot. But, in fairness, a wonderful coffee place was right downstairs, just across the hall from the elevator. So running downstairs for a cup of quality coffee was actually quite easy. I could sing its praises for days.

The Mandalay Bay Resort has been one of my favorite hotels to visit on the strip for years. I find it to be a great spot for meeting up with friends, seeing live bands, and some of the other great attractions the hotel offers. For locals, it's an \"easy access\" hotel on the strip because of it's location, at the far south end of the strip, with great restaurants and live shows nightly. For visitors, it can truly be \"one-stop shopping\", in that they have a great mall (The Shops at Mandalay Bay), wonderful pools (including a great wave pool), about a dozen restaurants ( a few of them are truly world class), and amazing entertainment (the huge stadium venue, the House of Blues, and headlining bands playing by the Pool in the summer). One hint for visitors: I you want to have a night out and do the \"Strip Thing\" ...... Take a cab. The hotels look very close because they're so huge. It is a serious pain to try to \"hoof it\" all the way to the Flamingo Hilton, Caesar's, and the Wynn Resort. It's only about a $10 cab ride to get to the heart of the Strip. I think you should definitely try the strip thing for one night, just to see the sights and the spectacle of Vegas. Once you've gotten that out of the way, The Madalay Bay Resort has a ton of attractions that can keep you busy for a week. My wife surprised me with dinner and a suite at Mandalay Bay on Feb. 28th. We had an amazing dinner at China Grill, played a few poker machines, then just retired to our two-room suite and had a great time.

Please feel free to contact me with any questions. CHECK IN/CHECK OUT: Very friendly and efficient, no problems at all. We (my boyfriend and i) were happy to hear we would be on a high floor and have a strip view. Our room (35805) was one of the standard suites and it was perfect for us! In fact, because the room was so enjoyable we spent a lot more time in it than we normally would. (On our first morning, we got a real kick out of watching from our room as the window washers made their way from the very top floor, allll the way down the building.) ROOM DETAILS: Huge flat screen in the living area, smaller flat screen in the master bath (it was wonderful to soak in the tub at night while watching mindless television!) and a \"normal\" t.v. in the bedroom. The closets are mirrored (in fact there's mirrors pretty much everywhere) which i though was cool. Lots of browns and subdued colors. Dark lighting (some of the lights are on dimmers). A very sophisticated and metropolitan feel to everything about this hotel and the room itself. Not a trace of smoke. THEhotel and M.Bay are great smelling hotels - someone else mentioned that the whole place smells like a spa, which is true! The common areas were immaculate - no leftover room service dishes, trash near the elevators were always empty, etc. It seemed well cared for. I also noticed that they played great music - it really fit the mood of the hotel. Bed/linens were very comfortable and i must say that THEhotel was the QUIETEST vegas hotel room i've ever stayed in. And i'm sensitive to noise, so that's saying a lot. The bedroom can be closed off from the rest of the room, so this eliminates virtually all noise from the hallways. We didn't hear a peep from our neighbors above us or next to us. (I started to refer to our room as \"the bunker.\") I got a great night's sleep here, and let's face it...how many times can you say that in vegas?? SPA/FITNESS CENTER: We did not use these facilities, though we did go up to check them out. The spa employees were very friendly and greeted us right away. The gym was huge and filled with state of the art equipment. One man was on the treadmill, and that was the only person we saw. Everything appeared clean and in order. The spa looked very elegant and i definitely plan on getting a treatment or two next time! DINING: We had breakfast one morning at THEcafe - service was friendly but a bit slow. Food was very consistent with other vegas cafes, both in price and quality. I believe my mushroom omelet was around $14 and included the standard potatoes and toast and was very good. We also ate at two other restaurants, which were in Mandalay Bay, just a quick walk from THEhotel. China Grill was very expensive for what it was - one chicken curry appetizer and two (weak) drinks were $55. Our server was a bit odd and his antics included talking and singing to himself...it was interesting! And our lunch at Red, White and Blue was pretty good - tuna melt and chicken mango salad came to about $35. Service was friendly. We also had drinks at MIX (on the 64th floor) which is always fun - it wasn't very lively in there but you cannot beat the view! Cocktails at Eye Candy were weak ($14 each) but the crowd was good and the people watching in vegas is of course, some of the best in the world. A couple of minor complaints about the hotel would be that some of our toiletries weren't replaced on the 2nd day - i assume they would have been if we had asked, so it seems like this is some way for them to save money maybe? A little cheap, if you ask me. We also noticed a few stains on the decorative pillows (not the ones we actually slept on). It looked like someone's hair or make up products, so nothing too gross. We just took them off the bed and didn't get too close. :) THEhotel was like entering a calm oasis after a hectic day/night spent in the rest of Vegas.

One day, there would be a shortage of towels, and then the next day, enough towels but no replacement for used amenities (bath powder, conditioner, etc.). The mini-bar was never re-stocked. One day, the room was not cleaned at all although I left the room at 1:00 p.m. 3) The flat screen TVs were nice but the volume would have to be at max to get any sound at all. 4) Overall service at the front desk was very lacking and inefficient.

It had a separate living room with couch, chair, desk, wet bar, cd player, and huge flat screen tv. It was perfect for watching the game with friends. There was a hallway bathroom as well for visitors. The bedroom was kind of small, but had plenty of closet space and had an ihome on the nightstand. Another tv was in the bedroom too. The master bathroom was huge. It had a seperate shower and tub thing, a two sink vanity, a flat screen tv, and the toilet was in a seperate closet for added privacy. I would give the actual suite at The Hotel an 8 out of 10. It was a good place to party and watch games. The reason I would not give it a 10 was that the room was starting to show it's age and felt dirty. Now the bad stuff: We had a suite on the 31st floor and could hear the MIx club rocking loudly late into the night. We usually fell asleep pretty late and the party was still going. It was very annoying when trying to get to sleep. The service was lacking. As others have noted, the room service takes forever. And when the food arrived it was cold. The service in the restaurant was also bad. In both instances it felt like TheHotel did not have enough staff.

For example, we at about 3am, from our room on the 61st floor, we began hearing what someone called \"King Kong\"... some incredibly loud crashing/banging. It was only occasional, but I can honestly say that I thought about how similar that sound might have been to part of the building actually collapsing (not that I would know). After speaking with a very polite person on the phone, the noises stopped - at least until the morning. But there is a right time for everything. Also, check-in was maybe the easiest I have ever had in Vegas. - The Food: We ate at a few of the restaurants, this time and other times. All were very good. Even impressed with the coffee shop at the bottom of the elevators (although they were far from clean - they seemed like they were missing an employee). - The Room: Very comfortable bed, huge bathing tub... could have used a larger vanity/sink area, great view... windows were literally floor to ceiling, curtain buttons... nice to have, but what is the point of them being across the room and behind the TV/entertainment/dresser piece of furniture? Maybe by the bed!?!?! :) - Complaints: Only that I am totally frustrated that places this nice make you pay for internet still. WHY!?? In fact, it hurt them, and business for Vegas in general. We wanted to get online to look up the restaurants in the hotel and elsewhere, as well as clubs, bars, etc... and we ended up spending a lot more time in the room because we could not look such things up. In this day, this is just an embarrassing practice that seems to have taken over Vegas, but it is certainly not the norm in other hotels. It is such a frustration, I refuse to give 5 stars.

THE hotel looked super new... and super chic! When you enter, the whole hotel smells like an upscale spa... the music is great, the design is gorgeous... Check in was fast and easy, and the room is SPECTACULAR. We didn't have much of a view, but over 700 square feet of space for a reasonable price... I loved having the half bath in the living area. We had people in our room and didn't have to let them see our messy bathroom! The linens and the bed were great, and housekeeping did a fantastic job. For the downside: I knew from reviews before I got there that room service was S L O W, so I didn't bother to try. My brother and sister-in-law did, and it took two hours. I noticed on the menu that you can call room service and set up a time the day before, but I didn't attempt that. The BIGGEST problem was the service in basically all of the restaurants that we went to at THE hotel and somewhat in Mandalay Bay. The first day, we went to THE cafe in the lobby of THE hotel. We were seated and drink orders were taken. The woman who brought us our drinks kept bringing them, but they were generally wrong, and she often seemed confused. Our waiter was downright rude. One of my party asked for a diet Pepsi while he was taking our order, and the waiter's response was \"You're going to have to wait a minute.\" Servers reached across the table to hand us items and we had to reach across each other instead of the server coming around to place drinks/ food items in front of us. When we asked to split our ticket three ways, the waiter had to come back and take our entire order. The whole time he was brusque and pushy. These may seem like small things, but when you're paying $25-$30 for lunch entrees you expect a certain amount of service. The food, however, was amazing. We experienced the same sort of service from the host and people who did the seating at the buffet. Earlier in the morning, the buffet was not crowded, yet the hosts were very pushy. \"Hurry up! Come up here! Walk all the way to the back. Get on this side!\" The food, once again was very good. I would suggest to arrive early. When my brother went on my reccommendation the next day at around 11, it was so crowded he couldn't even get to the food. The sushi at the sushi bar was excellent, but even that service was somehwat abrupt. Food AND service at the RED WHITE and BLUE was excellent both for dinner and for breakfast. Finally, the LOWLIGHT of our trip was our attempt to see the HEAVILY advertised \"burlesque\" show accompanied by a live three man band at Forty-Deuce. The show supposedly started at 10:30. At 11 we paid $25 cover charge per person... sight unseen. When we walked in, we were packed shoulder to shoulder in a walkway area. Around us were MULTIPLE sitting areas all roped off. When we asked about being seated ANYWHERE in the club, we were told the price would be $400 PER TABLE. We chose to stand. If there was a bar in the club, I couldn't find it. About a half hour passed by with no dancers, no shows unless you count the drunken bachlorette parties who continually got on stage as well as worked the pole. About 45 minutes in, one go go dancer came out... danced on the pole, took off her gloves, and left five minutes later. At midnight, we decided we were tired of waiting for the 10:30 show to start and walked out. We complained to several people in the front about the lack of show, all who seemed sympathetic. We then spoke to the manager who responded by saying, \"I sent a go go dancer out...\" Thanks a lot... so the six of us paid $150 to watch several drunk women dance.

Only after a few days in Vegas did I fully appreciate what an oasis THEhotel is compared to other large hotels on the Strip.

I booked there based on a co-worker's recommendation but I was a bit nervous after reading some of the negative comments on this site. As it turned out, my friend was right, we had a fantastic time. There was very little not to like. The suite was enormous and a good deal at the mid-week pricing. We found the staff helpful for those few little snags we did encounter, and we loved the hotel amenities. Perhaps because we were there at a relatively slow time of year, we did not encounter many of the problems that were mentioned by other reviewers. I'll tell you the downsides first: The biggest problem was housekeeping. They want to clean the room during the days, but we were generally asleep then. We would go out in the late afternoons and be gone for stretches of 8 hours or more, but unless we asked, they didn't come back to clean later. In other cities this might be understandable, but given the 24-hour nature of Vegas, they really should have 24-hour housekeeping. Other than that, only minor quibbles -- I booked a smoking single with a king-sized bed, they gave us a nonsmoking double, though the gal at registration said we could smoke and there wasn't any problem that we did. Also, if there's a way to pause an in-room movie, it wasn't obvious, and we didn't have a TV in the bathroom as had been advertised. We also wished there had been some cooking facilities in the suite; we used the minibar fridge and didn't get charged for anything (we took the drinks out and placed them in sight on top of the minibar itself). That's about it for the downside. I did twice encounter what seemed to be working girls in the lobby. But they also could have been extraordinarily friendly well-dressed hotel guests who really didn't have anything to do at 2:00 a.m. Depending on your circumstances, this could be a plus or a minus. Positive notes: We loved the decor, which some people might find austere. The main bathroom light seemed to start off dim, then get stronger, but there was a separately lighted makeup mirror that was an adequate alternative. The bed was super-comfortable, there was adequate closet space, and the shampoos and other stuff in the bathroom were fun. We found the staff to be friendly and accommodating. Room service was fast and efficient, they usually came more quickly than they said they would. The in-room meals that we had were fine. The restaurant on the main floor was good, and we loved the choices we had in the main Mandalay Bay and also the Luxor, which is connected. Special shout-outs go to Fleur de Lys and Fusia, two of the best places my sweetie and I have eaten, and restaurants are a hobby of ours. Maybe because we are from New York we didn't find the walking distances to be enormous. The Hotel is separated from the Mandalay Bay by a corridor of maybe 100 yards. I have to walk almost that far to get from my office to the bathroom at work. As others have noted, there's a wonderful sense of serenity that you experience when you leave the lively Mandalay casino floor and enter The Hotel, with its pleasant aroma. We had a car, which seems like a better option than relying on pricey Vegas taxis, although you could spend a pretty long vacation in the Mandalay Bay and never want to leave the property and its connected hotels. The Hotel had its own parking valets and a self-park garage that was conveniently close to the entrance. The valets were helpful and courteous. As others have noted, there are a lot of extra charges -- $12.99 a day for wireless access is pushing it -- but since the room price is a relatively good deal, you basically have unbundled services and you can pay for if you want them. Bottom line: If you want to stay in a classy, modern hotel that is one step removed from the frenetic pace of Las Vegas, this is the place.", "Date": "January 19, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "georgia", "Title": "\u201cGood price, spacious room but.....\u201d", "Author": "angelfish07", "ReviewID": "UR12775668", "Content": "We stayed one night at THE Hotel, M.Bay, Las Vegas.

The living room was well designed with sleek furniture and accessories \u2013 a well equipped desk, comfy couch, roomy armchair, large coffee table, side tables, Plasma, and a mini-bar with sink. It is one of the most usable and easy to hang out in living spaces I have experienced in a hotel -- great to hang out or throw a party.

From the time you step into TheLobby, you are re-enforced again and again that this is ThePlace to be, which is fine for some people, not so much for me. The toilet paper is even called TheTP. All that aside, along with the obvious form over function 'artistic vomit' that permeates this place, it is one heck of a nice place to stay. TheRooms: We stayed in a very nice suite at around 800 sqft. We had three tvs, an ipod docking station, wetbar, 1.5 baths, etc etc, very nice and very plush. Occasionally you have to do battle with form to get function. For example, the bathroom light is so low that it makes it hard to shave. But it looks nice in low light. I really like the desk area, the only problem here is that the wireless inet dint work. We had to go wired for inet, no biggie. Mandalay hotels have the shark reef on channel 26, so we kept all three tvs tuned to that and let the ipod docking station broadcast our audio, this was a nice option. If they put the music from the TheHotel along with it on channel 26, this would be even nicer. Bedding was decent, prolly soon in need of an overhaul if they want to be TheHotel. We bring our own 'throw', so no problems. Amenities were top notch, lotions and else are in jars not bottles, nice touch. Room came with a pocket shoe polisher which is also a nice touch. TheRoomService: I would avoid room service here if possible, we had one good experience, but one very bad one where we didn't get delivered for two plus hours (45 minute quote). TheSpa: The spa is another art nightmare, too chic for its own good. TheHelp here is equally worthless. Without any real great instructions on where to wait for TheTreatments. I got a great Deep tissue here however, that ,made TheLack of help, tolerable. TheMusic: I loved the music playing throughout TheHotel, it is chill out house that was a real nice departure from the usual muzack. You can also buy a CD with similar music so you can take TheMusic with you. TheRestaurants: We loved RumJungle. The tasting menu is the best option here, just do not load up on starches. Like every place in the LV, this place has a trap for you to fall in. They bring beans, salads and breads before they start bringing you the all-you-can-eat items, which invariably fills you up before you can eat too much of the high dollar items (like scallops, salmon, etc). Wolfgang Pucks entry at Mandalay (lupo) was about as mediocre as most of Puck's entries. I picked a risotto saphron cioppino like dish that was good, but i could have made it at home with a box of riceoroni risotto au grauten. StripSteak is one of the best steak houses I have ever been too. Very pricey, but if you can afford a $54 filet, you will taste the difference. They also have A5 Kobe steaks if you really want to throw some cash at this place. I recommend the Bleu Cheese scalloped potatoes if they are available. You will not need more than one order, as these are one of the most rich tasting side dishes you will ever consume. I also had a really nice Maine Lobster Cocktail here that was real nice. TheNightlife: Forty-Deuce is one of my fav clubs anywhere. They do real low key, kinda artsy burlesque. The wife an I head there every time we are in town and you can gain free entry by eating at any of the medium to high end restaurants at Mandalay. TheService in general was real good, sans room service. Bell Service was top notch. Maid service as well. One major thing that is worth mentioning is the cat and mouse game you have to play to keep from getting charged for TheMiniBar. When a place advertises a refrigerator, but it is filled with mini bar items it is usually worth calling to find out what the policy is. When we called we were told to put the items back before made service each day. There needs to exist a better way to deal with this, for I like to bring my own beverages, and in this case it would have been nice to have a cooler, rather than play cat and mouse with the mini-bar guy. Consider yourself warned. All in all we had a real nice stay and would stay here again without hesitation.

(can't emphasize that enough). Plenty of storage room. Lighting is on an automatic dimmer, the longer the light stays on, the brighter it gets (environmentally friendly). Decor very nice. Housekeeping was exceptional, always done in the morning. Everything impecable. Lots of toiletries. In general, the Hotel staff was excellent. Check in and chek out very helpful, polite and professional. They will assist you with anything, including directions to nearby attractions. Take advantage of the Dollar Rent a Car desk at the Mandalay Bay Hotel. Very convenient. Check out time from THE Hotel is early, so we rented a car the last day and went out to Red Rock Canyon and Hoover Dam, and then drove to the airport. Saved a lot of money (instead of purchasing guided tours and using a taxi to the airport). Suites with strip view are numbered as follows: The First two numbers are the floor number, then the third number is an 8 or a 9 (depending on which hallway your room is). If you get an eight, then odd numbers are strip view (i.e. 11815), if a 9, then even numbers are strip view (i.e. 11916). I hope this works for all floors, but at least that was the case on the 11th floor. The Mandalay Bay has the best Restaurants in town.

We're not gamblers, and we wanted our hotel experience to be a beautiful, no-hassle retreat while in Vegas. THEhotel hit the spot! THEhotel is upscale, yet understated...very much up our \"young 30s\" alley. We were looking at the Wynn or Bellagio as our other options in Vegas. Just stepping one foot in the (beautiful, grand, over the top, VERY BUSY!) lobby of the Bellagio, we new that wouldn't have been the place for us...though a room with a view of the fountains is probably priceless! We never made it over to the Wynn, but it is a beautiful spectacle on the strip. We also stayed a night at the Venetian in the Venezia Towers during this trip - absolutely gorgeous and HUGE suite. But, that was also my (minor) complaint about the Venetian...it was just HUGE and \"over the top\" in every way. THEhotel and the Venetian were both awesome, and I'd highly recommend both....just depends on what experience you're looking for...Venetian is beautiful and over the top...THEhotel is simple and refined. The second you walk into the lobby of THEhotel...you will feel that it is just very different from the other hotels...classy, understated, and unassuming. People don't come here to be flashy...they come for a relief from the strip and a luxurious, but not over the top, hotel stay. For an chilled-out hotel stay in Vegas, I would opt for THEhotel again in a heartbeat! One perk sincerely worth mentioning...Mandalay, Luxor & Exacaliber are connected by a (free!) tram, making it super easy to check out three properties extensively during your stay! Walking from hotel casino to hotel casino is a drag, and we're in good shape! (We both had ouchie feet and blisters at the end of our four days in Vegas.) So, why not 5 stars? This is silly, but the bath products smelled horrible! And, in this day when the airline limits so much, I am at the mercy of the hotel's shampoo, lotion, etc. So, this is a big deal for me. I probably should have mentioned this to someone during our stay, but complaining seemed like too big of a hassle during our very casual and relaxing stay in Vegas. Oh, almost forgot...our favorite \"normal\" priced restaurant was Mandalay Place's Burger Bar. We told ourselves we wouldn't eat somewhere twice on this trip, but Burger Bar's good prices, HUGE beer selection, and location convenient to THEhotel won out this time. And, one more thing --- we discovered it too late, but, if you like clubs...one to NOT miss is a tiny place called eyecandy (I think) in the middle of the Mandalay casino.

We got to the desk very quick even though there was quite a big queue. The girl who checked us in was nothing but charming, and gave us a beautiful room, ok it was on a low floor ie no view, but it was a corner room and as such was enormous, and the attention to detail plus the amazing facilities was nothing less than worthy of 7 stars if it existed! We stayed 5 nights on the way thru, and 2 nights on the way back of a circuit of the south west. We had a regular sized suite on the way back, still enormous, but I guess we'd been a little spoilt with our suite at the start. The eating options, enterntainment and gambling options too are all first class. Staff are very freindly and happy. Plus the complimentary drinks whislt gambling are THE most generous and best at any casino in Vegas! Of course its more expensive than most, but you really do get what you pay for, and even though its truly a 5 star resort, they are in no way snobby, they in fact are more freindly and down to earth than many lower class establishments! The Mandalay beach is to die for, with real sand, wave machine etc its like you really are at a real beach resort. You couls literally spend a whole week or even longer with never leaving the property, as there is so much to do plus the very handy monorail link to Luxor and Excalibur is dead handy to catch their shows and also get a head start on to the mid strip area. We had a lot of wonderful hotels on our long trip, but it was wonderful to start and finish at THE Hotel, I would recommend it to anyone without a second thought, and we are already planning our next trip back here within the next year!

Two adults with 3 children. Lets start with the POSITIVES: We got a great price on our rooms and the third night free through Mirage's website! (this definitely swayed our decision on where to stay). The lobby is understated but still impressive (once inside from the underground entrance). The modern feel is accomplished through very tall ceilings, sleek lines, rich and dark wood features accented by clear glass blown chandeliers and tall lighted pillars. The lobby has a persistent odor of wood polish as the staff is working overtime on oiling the wood and polishing the marble floors. The bellmen and front desk personnel were very personable and accommodating. The front desk originally gave us two adjoining suites on the 26th floor. The views of the mountain range were amazing however one of the nonsmoking rooms was clearly smoked in so we moved to a lower floor with two suites and an equally wonderful view of the Luxor all lit up. The spa is quite nice - arrive early for your treatment and enjoy the facilities including bottled water, juices, snacks, etc... Our dinner at The Hotel's Mix was better than Mandalay Bay's Strip Steak or the Bayside Buffet. ***Be sure to visit the Mix lounge - the view at sunset is beautiful. Also include a visit the restroom! (It is a private toilet which faces a floor to ceiling glass window for a view of the entire strip). Now the NEGATIVES and NEUTRALS: The rooms are as pictured BUT the photos do not fully display the extent of the perpetual darkness. The rooms are in fairly good condition, showing some signs of wear and tear--ie worn carpet, scratches in woodwork, one broken piece of marble in shower. However, due to the heavily tinted dark glass, the deep brown walls, the dark wood coupled with inadequate lighting - you cannot achieve light - even in the morning. (Some recessed lighting could solve this problem) The best way to describe the situation is to say it feels as though you have your sunglasses or shades on in the room and you cannot get any brighter than that. The darkness is fun and funky on the first day but gets old by day three. The pool(only 1 open at this time of year) and restaurants are a hike from The Hotel. The casino atmosphere is okay but not that special. The hostess staff at Red, White & Blue is horrendous and the restaurant mediocre. With a VACANT restaurant the hostesses frowned, hemmed and hawed, and sulked about whether they could seat us for the raw bar and cocktails at 5PM. The Mandalay Bay buffet is very average for dinner but actually pretty nice for lunch and breakfast. The wait for room service was 2 hours at one point on Thursday evening when returned from Momma Mia. Generally room service had at least an hour to an hour and a half wait anytime of the day or night. *****If paying full price STRONGLY consider Bellagio, Wynn, Four Seasons or even Venice over The Hotel at Mandalay Bay. Those properties deliver a much higher standard of service and atmosphere that runs throughout the property overall. While I was satisfied with The Hotel I don't think I would stay again -- even with a great rate.

It took a while during check-in to persuade them to find us a room with a king sized bed. This is a pet hate of mine that hotels will not guarantee the type of bed at the time of booking \u2013 I mean I\u2019m using a hotel primarily as a place to sleep, so the bed should be the most fundamental element of the booking! We were very impressed with the quality of the rooms for the price of the hotel \u2013 they are decorated to a high standard with two good televisions and a very nice bathroom with a big separate shower. However, ours was already starting to show signs of wear and tear - almost everywhere you look there are scratches, dents and marks. This was not a problem for us because it was all quite minor, but I wonder how long these rooms will continue to look good for. I would agree with some of the other reviews here that this hotel\u2019s biggest problem is the thickness of the walls. You can hear everyone walking past in the corridor and the people either side. Luckily our neighbours during this stay were very quiet, but you may not be so lucky. The soundproofing of the windows is also not too good and the traffic 16 floors down was easily heard. My other pet hate with big hotels is how they\u2019re still charging for internet access ($14 a night here) \u2013 when everyone else like Holiday Inn, Hampton Inn, Best Western (etc etc...) all include it for free. We had room service a couple of times and it was average quality \u2013 and quite slow (e.g. 50 minutes).

We had been excited to stay in the refurbished Mandalay Bay rooms, but were immediately excited at the prospects of an upgrade. We were put in a standard room on the 60th floor's north wing facing east in the very inside corner of the hotel with a pretty good view of the strip. The room was very nice, if not small, had a standard TV in the huge built-in with closets on one side of the room and a very nice, high-end bathroom with Givenchy toiletries. I was amazed at the amount of marble in just one bathroom. However, we would discover the next morning, the entire morning, that this room was right next to housekeeping, which was obnoxious. Doors, carts banging into everything, talking, yelling - any noise you could think of was going on outside our door all morning. The sound insulation is definitely lacking. There was even a visible gap beneath the door that didn't help. So, beyond some nice finishes and a feeling of prestige, THEhotel was kind of a let down. It's about as far as you can get away from the entrance to the pool and you would think the housekeeping would be a little more respectful first thing in the morning. Do they stage all housekeeping out of the 60th floor? The second night a horrible smoky stench filled our room and hallway. It smelled like someone was burning a rack of lamb on a grill and it became hard to breath. I was too tired to do anything about it, so I stuck my head under the sheets and kept sleeping. I was told the next day by the front desk that they had received no complaints. Weird. It was really THAT bad.

Overall, we had a very good experience at The Hotel and would be happy to recommend it. We arrived on Friday around 11AM and were pleased to see that they had a room available for us right away. Unfortunately, my only choices were an 8th floor with a king bed or a higher floor with queen beds, despite my request to have a high floor, king bed, with a strip view. No strip views were available, but it wasn\u2019t a big deal. The hotel lobby was very quiet. I was second on line to check-in, and I checked in without any issues. What a difference compared to previous stays at the Bellagio, where check-in can take over an hour. Next to the front desk you will find a small room with two internet stations. While they do charge for their usage, they will let you use them free of charge if you simply want to print your boarding pass or check your flight status. The room is just as many have described. We found it to be clean and modern. The living room has a nice-sized Philips plasma HDTV, but unfortunately, they offer no HD programming. They\u2019ve got a bunch of on-demand programming, and a decent amount of free programming (ESPN, ESPN2, CNN, and the networks). There is also a DVD player in the living room. The bedroom also has a TV, although it is not a plasma flat-screen, and it does not have a DVD player. There is also a small LCD TV in the bathroom, which we did not use. We found the beds to be very comfortable. They will rent a mini refrigerator to you at $20 per day, unless you just want to refill your bathroom or bar sink with ice to keep your beverages cold. Their mini-bar had a few small bottles of vodka, soda, and red bull, but I think it was broken, since all of the drinks were warm. I know some people have complained about the amount of walking you have to do as a guest, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a big deal. From the moment you leave the elevator at The Hotel, it\u2019s about a 5-7 minute walk to the wave pool at Mandalay Bay. It\u2019s about a one minute walk from the elevator to the gaming floor at MB. It takes 90 seconds to get to the entrance/escalator for Mandalay Place, which is a shopping mall. If you\u2019re staying at The Hotel and want to have dinner at Mandalay Bay, follow the signs for \u201crestaurants\u201d. There are probably 6 or 7 all in the same spot. It\u2019s a 3 minute walk from The Hotel. We had dinner on our last night at Shanghai Lilly, which was very good (Chinese food). Back to the pool (which they call the Mandalay Bay Beach); it was a lot bigger than I had pictured, and it was very nice. The main attraction is a huge wave pool \u2013 the pool goes from zero entry to about 7 feet deep. The waves run often, maybe once every 5-10 minutes. The majority of the seating at the Beach is on lounge chairs that cover the sandy beach. The chairs are not very comfortable, by the way. Towels are free and are available once you enter the Beach complex. To enter, every guest (over age 14 I think) needs to show a room card for either MB or The Hotel. They provide pool side drink service that you can charge to your room if you prefer. A pina colada is $12 before tip. Aside from the wave pool, they also have a lazy river, and two smaller pools. We had a quick lunch before laying out pool side. They have food available to-go, but it was easier and more relaxing to eat at a table. They have a bunch of salads, appetizers, and sandwiches, which were all good for the most part (there were 7 of us total in our party). The food wasn\u2019t cheap, but this isn\u2019t a cheap hotel. Lunch for two was probably $55 or so. We didn\u2019t spend too much time entertaining ourselves at Mandalay Bay or at The Hotel. But we did manage to go to Mix and the House of Blues. There are two different Mix places \u2013 the lounge serves drinks and appetizers only. It opens at 5PM daily. There is also the Mix restaurant, which serves dinner at 6PM daily. If you want to go to the lounge, you have to go there through the special \u201cMix\u201d elevator \u2013 you will find it a few hundred feet away from the spot where The Hotel\u2019s hallway meets the MB gaming floor. If you try to access Mix by using the \u201cregular\u201d elevators before 6PM, the elevator will not take you there, since it thinks you are trying to go to the Mix restaurant, which doesn\u2019t open until 6PM. I attempted to avoid confusion by calling before we went out, and the person on the other end left out all of these details. The lounge had an eclectic appetizer menu with pricey drinks. Two apps and two drinks for was around $65. You are able to sit out on the patio and take in the view if you\u2019d like. The lounge starts charging a cover at 10PM. The cover is $10, but I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s the regular cover charge, or the price you pay when you show a room key. We did not have time to eat at the Mix restaurant. We stopped by the House of Blues inside MB one evening, around 12:30 or so. There are two sides to the HOB, each of which has its own admission. The pricing was a bit sketchy, as we though it was $20 per couple, but when we tried to pay, the price went up to $20 per person. When we explained that was different than we had just heard, and that we had an issue with the pricing, they lowered it to $20 per couple. The salsa and merengue theme was not doing it for us, and as we complained to the bartenders, they actually agreed with us. They managed to get us up to the other side of HOB without having to pay (again), and we appreciated that a whole lot. The other side featured \u201coldies\u201d night which was primarily 70s, 80s, and 90s dance music. A 70s cover band came on stage and was actually pretty good, considering we\u2019re all around 30 years old and not big fans of the 70s dance scene. The only other thing to mention is check-out. The latest \u201clate-checkout\u201d was 11:30AM, as regular check-out is at 11:00AM. Knowing that we had a 10PM flight, I booked the room for the whole day/night, instead of having to depend on them storing my luggage for most of the day. There\u2019s no discounted rate for doing this, but I found it to be convenient and worth the price. Checkout itself was simple, since you can drop off your keys in a drop box in the elevator lobby. The TV allows you to review your bill in advance if you\u2019d like to do so, and then they will email your final bill to you, by request. Overall, we both enjoyed our stay at THEhotel. We found the staff to be courteous and friendly, the hotel to be clean and modern, and the amenities to be plentiful (considering that you\u2019re only a few steps away from all that is Mandalay Bay). As long as you keep in mind that you\u2019re staying at the bottom of the Las Vegas strip and you\u2019ll need a taxi to almost everywhere, I think it\u2019s a great hotel and would recommend it to family and friends.", "Date": "October 23, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "dallas", "Title": "\u201cGreat Stay!!\u201d", "Author": "sunshine0430", "ReviewID": "UR10233510", "Content": "My stay at the Mandalay was for a technical conference being held at Mandalay Bay.

There is a great bar called The Mix which has fantastic views overlooking The Strip. One downside of the hotel is that to get to the pool you have to walk through the casino and it is a good 15 min walk but the pool/beach is lovely so it makes up for it! I think this is the case in most Vegas hotels. Overall we were really pleased with the hotel - you have all the amenities of the Mandalay Bay but THE Hotel feels very calm and quiet in comparison.", "Date": "October 17, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Prince Rupert", "Title": "\u201cVery nice room, service not quite as good as it could be, overall a great stay\u201d", "Author": "trilinearmipmap", "ReviewID": "UR10069452", "Content": "We stayed 3 nights at The Hotel at Mandalay bay October 4th to 7th. Arriving at the hotel the first impression we got was poor. The entrance is a big parking garage. Then there is a long walk down a wide corridor / entrance foyer to the reception desk about a hundred yards away. There was no bell staff on hand to take our luggage so this was a bit of a hike. The front desk staff was very friendly and helpful. We booked through the Amex FHR program and the clerk offered us our room upgrade and complimentary amenity etc. without any prompting. We were upgraded to a corner suite. I am told this is no better than their regular suite but I have never seen the regular suite so I can't say. The room was the nicest room I have ever stayed in and this is compared mostly to four and some five star places. The bedroom was large. There was a fair sized living room. Bedroom and living room had large flatscreen TV's. The main bathroom was spacious and had its own TV, soaker tub, shower and two sinks. A second bathroom had a toilet and sink only. The service overall was not up to the standard I expected. Calls to the front desk took a long time to get answered and same with calls to book a spa appointment. I gave up calling a few times after 10 to 15 rings. Room service took 45 minutes (they said it would take 45 minutes and it did) and I am used to much faster room service. Service at the cafe downstairs was sometimes prompt and sometimes slow. The food and drink prices seemed very inexpensive to me considering the quality of the hotel. We had breakfast and lunch a few times at the cafe downstairs and there were a good range of choices on the menu. We both thought the cafe food was quite good as was the room service meal we had. We did not eat at any of the other restaurants in the Mandalay Bay hotel adjoining this hotel. The decor of the hotel lobby and entrance area was some kind of modern dark style which was supposed to look hip but just gave me a headache. We never waited more than two minutes to get a cab.

When we checked in, there were no rooms available at Mandalay Place, so we were given a room at The Hotel. WOW is the best way to describe our experience. The first think you notice when walking through the lobby is the smell. There was a very light floral scent in the lobby, and even into the casino. I am completely in love with that scent, and hope to some day find out what it is that they pipe into the cooling system. The Hotel is tastefully decorated in a minimalist way: black marble and the names of various shops/cafes are The Coffee Shop, The Store, etc. Love it!!! After the noise of the casino, when you step into The Hotel you feel completely relaxed. Our room was on the 13th floor and was a two room suite. The \"living room\" area had a mini-bar, desk, couch, chair, and large plasma TV. The bedroom area and bathroom were AWESOME. Crisp linens, plump comforter, lush towels, all the free toiletries you can imagine including bath powders, lotions, shampoos, hair \"masques\", shoe polishers, and hand-made soap. There was another plasma TV in the bedroom and one in the bathroom, and of course the phone in the toilet area. It was amazing. The housekeeper for our floor came by and introduced herself (Joyce), and promised to take care of us. She delivered on her promise all three days we were there. The casino at Mandalay Bay was not crowded, very well laid out, and was the only casino we played at that had slot machines that were actually paying out. I didn't win a jackpot, but did come home with $300 more than I left with, which says a lot in Vegas! The downsides to staying at The Hotel are: 1. $$$ It's pricey, $280 per night for our room. 2. $12.99 per night for internet access. Seriously, can't they throw that in? 3. Location on the Strip: it's at the tail end of the Strip and they make it extremely difficult to find your way out, which I suppose is the whole point, to get you to gamble there. 4. Raffles Restaurant: $$$, long wait, and the food was definitely not worth the money. Only good thing was they put families with small kids all into a separate dining room away from the couples who wanted a more intimate dinner. Steak was like shoe leather. 5. $20 a day to use the work-out facilities. Again, for the price of the room, can't you include use of the work-out facilities? 6. $$$ to visit Shark Reef. I know it's a \"for profit\" operation, but this is yet another attraction that should be free for paying guests. Over all, I thought this was the nicest room I've ever stayed at while visiting Vegas (comparing it to Tropicana, Stratosphere, Venetian, and MGM). I'm not sure I would stay there again, as I can visit the casino for the smell and loose slots without staying there.

Let me also say that I am not a high maint. person and have been quite happy at holiday inns, disney and various hotels in NYC, I wont stay here again nor can I reccommed it to anyone else. The we had to switch rooms twice, I got sick because of wet carpeting and moldy smelling room and when we asked at 10 am, if we could please swtich rooms as I didnt think this one was ready for guests, we got snippy treatment at the front desk and were only allowed to get a new room after I said that we would like to check out and would try to Four Seasons instead. I also must say that I worked in hotels for over 5 years and try REALLY hard to be polite, tip generously and thank ALL the people that help us in any way. I was EXTREMELY displeased with the level of service, and general attitude of the front desk staff. In addition, we booked a package that inlcuded use of the spa facilities and when we went in to take a quick peek at the bathouse area the 'rottweiler' desk attendant could not have been more unpleasant and rude. We had hit or miss service in the restaurants in Mandalay Bay - The Red White and Blue cafe there is a waste of $ and the girl at the ice cream counter there was horrible. Again, I almost feel badly being so negative, because in general the more stressed out and rude someone is to me the nicer I try to be in return. Ive spent 25 years in customer service, sales you name it and was really taken aback at the treatment we recieved. The hotel is attractive, modern and sleek, the valet attendants were wonderful and the views - IF YOU ASK FOR A STRIP VIEW were lovely. Be prepared to hike 20 miles thru the Mandalay Bay lobby and casino to get to the pools, and be prepared for an ordeal if you want to charge ANYTHING to your room. Overall, I would stay at the regular Mandalay Bay, the Bellagio or the 4 Seasons if I ever return to Vegas. The Mirage pool area looked really nice if you want a cool pool, but I understand the rooms are very small there.

After our recent stay at THEhotel, that will no longer be the case - hands down the best hotel we have ever stayed at in town and we plan to stay there again when we return next year. Connected to Mandalay Bay, this \"boutique\" hotel provided everything we needed on our recent trip both in terms of quality and service. The standard two-room suite was quite spacious, clean and well-appointed - the perfect environment for recovering from the excesses of the previous evening. Check-in was a breeze; although we arrived later in the evening, we never saw that long of a line at the desk during our stay - nothing which comes close to what we have seen at some of the main strip hotels in years past. As others have noted, the lobby is rather dark, but that was a plus for us. The decor, coupled with the lack of a casino of any kind in the lobby, was actually soothing after being around the bright lights, clanging slot machines and throngs to be found in the casinos and along the strip (the Mandalay casino is a brief walk down the hallway). It was enjoyable to be able to walk back to our room, or enjoy a drink at the lobby bar, without having to deal with all the noise and traffic that typically surrounds the lobby in the other hotels. In fact, if it wasn't for the view from our room, we might have forgotten that we were even in Vegas while in our room. Speaking of bars, the Mix Lounge on the top floor of the hotel offers one of the best views of the strip, second only to that from the Foundation Room at the top of Mandalay Bay. The beds and the sofa in the room were comfortable and we never heard our neighbors (and rarely heard any noise from the hallway) during our four nights there. A few reviews here have complained about long waits for room service; the two times we ordered found our food delivered within less than 30 minutes. Our interactions with the staff were always pleasant and we found them able to answer any questions that we had during our stay. In short - great rooms, excellent staff, and no problems whatsoever. A few reviews have mentioned that THEhotel is a bit pricey - this is true. But you do get what you pay for - and we found the place to be well worth the cost. However, if you are looking for a deal on a hotel room, or have an issue with the little charges for all the little things such as room service, etc. this is probably not the place for you. This is not the hotel for those looking for a $5.99 prime rib dinner or who go to Vegas planning on a hot night at the nickel slots. This is an upscale hotel, and prices and charges will reflect that. It has also been mentioned on here that THEhotel is not all that kid-friendly. I would agree with this and will gladly promote that fact - if only because the ambiance of the hotel would have been ruined by a bunch of kids running around (why do people even bring their kids to Vegas anyways?).

Overall we really liked the hotel and would recommend it to friends, albeit with a few caveats/tips. See pros and cons below for more detail: Pros: --The hotel had a stylish, modern feel similar to that of a W Hotel. --The rooms were great, really no complaints. Very comfortable beds, 2 bathrooms (not sure if that is the case in all rooms), excellent air conditioning, and 3 tv's. The main bathroom is better than almost any I've ever stayed in. Some people might complain about the view from the room, so if that's important to you, insist on a view of the Strip. Also, note that the sofa is not a pullout, so it is a challenge to sleep 3 people (though you can request a cot). --The hotel has a store in the lobby that sells snacks, toiletries, and beverages that is open late -- very nice for when you come home late and don't want to pay the high mini-bar fees or order expensive room service. --The pool area, though about 5-10 minutes away from the rooms, is a lot of fun. Wave pool, lazy river, good music, food easily available, etc. In particular, check out the club upstairs \"Moorea\" which has a $50 entry fee. It's smaller and has its own bar and pools that are slightly less crowded. Note that many of the women are topless (which can be good or bad depending on you and the crowd you're with--for a bachelor party, we enjoyed it). Frankly, we felt like were on the set of the HBO show \"Entourage\" --The casino is nice with lots of tables and a great sports room --There is a mall attached with some cool boutiques and restaurants Cons: --Everything is really expensive. If you're concerned about money, but still want to stay here, keep in mind that room service, restaurants, internet, the spa, and even some parts of the pool all have pretty stiff fees. Nothing free here. Even the public computer in the business center next to the front desks costs $15 for 30 minutes of use. --The cab lines can be REALLY long. You might want to try to arrange a limo or car service if you have a large group and/or don't want to wait in the long lines. The hotel is at the end of the strip and not walking distance to most of the other hotels in Vegas that you're likely to visit. At the very least, allow a lot of time to wait in line to get a cab. Also, here's a tip: the Four Seasons is in the same complex as Mandalay, and it's easier to get cabs there, and also easier to get dropped off there. --The front desk line can also be REALLY long. There must have been 20 people waiting on Friday afternoon, though admittedly most of the rest of the time it didn't seem too bad. You might want to make sure you can do express checkout on Sunday morning, which could also get busy (I left very early, so I'm not sure). --You need reservations for everything. If you want a cabana ($250, 4-5 people) or a bungalow ($500, 8-10 people) at the pool, make reservations well in advance (i.e., long before you arrive, they sell out days/weeks in advance). If you want to go any of the restaurants or clubs, MAKE A RESERVATION! This is true for everything...if there's one thing I would tell a friend about Vegas, it's this: make reservations for as many things as you can ahead of time!! It really makes visiting there a much more enjoyable experience. Try to plan out where you're having dinner and what clubs you're going to on what nights, and make reservations! If you think you're just going to walk into places, or make reservations after you arrive, you're going to be very frustrated (unless you're a group of women). I have now stayed at Harrah's, The Palms, and THE Hotel at Mandalay Bay. Though The Palms has some cool clubs, I really liked the room and atmosphere at THE Hotel so it would probably be my favorite of the three hotels. If they cut out some of the nickel and diming, reduced the front desk line, and did a better job of helping hotel guests get into some of the restaurants and clubs in the complex, I'd give it 5 stars.", "Date": "September 16, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tri-Cities, WA", "Title": "\u201cLoved Our Stay\u201d", "Author": "MLBKRB", "ReviewID": "UR8710719", "Content": "We had a great time at this hotel!!

The hotel is one of the newer and higher priced hotels. It is a fantastic hotel - but lots of the hotels are in Vegas, so you just have to consider what it is that you want from your trip. For me, the accomodation was fantastic, the rooms are stylish and you get a plasma in the spacious lounge, the bedroom and the bathroom. The rooms are furnished in boutique hotel style and are really stylish. The bed was one of the comfiest ever, and the bathroom amazing (for those who read my reviews will know that the bathroom is very important!), it had the deepest bath ever, not very eco friendly to use it, but fab, a walk in shower and twin sinks - just fantastic. The hotel itself, because it is attached to the Mandalay Bay doesnt have all the major facilities of its own, the gym is fantastic, but you do have to trek a long way to the pool. Also, because the Manadalay bay pool has a lazy river and a wave machine it does tend to be one of the hotels that attracts a lot of kids. The pool, was the thing I was looking forward to most, and was the thing I was most disapointed with. It was really busy (not the hotels fault), but it was teeming with kids (it was summer holidays) but was also so noisy, pumping loud music out from every area - there was no escape - its not a relaxing pool area. The pool at the Bellagio (from previous visits) was for me much better as you can get away from the loud music if you want and can actually relax and the space versus the number of people is much greater. The hotel, does have a great gym - although even as a guest you have to pay twenty dollars a day for the privelige of using it (fairly normal for Vegas though). The Bathouse Spa, although very stylish and with great facilities disapointed me a little as there is no unisex area and I like to go to the spa with my partner. The bar areas in The hotel - particularly the fantastic Mix bar at the top of the hotel are worth a visit. The view is great and it is uber cool...check out the toilets....floor to celiling windows - you can see out, but you hope no one can see in!! The hotel and the Mandalay itself are positioned at the top end of the strip so you really do need to get a taxi everywhere - I prefer staying at The Bellagio or something nearer the middle of the strio so that you can wander our and about easily and enjoy the atmosphere.

It was an absolute amazing experience. We were booked at the regular Mandalay Bay Hotel, but when using the front desk tip trick, we were upgraded to THE hotel. The rooms were very spacious and comfortable. I read some of the other reviews, and the talk about small closet space is ridiculous. My wife and I had more than enough room in the closets and there was even room for the additional clothes she bought when she went shopping! The smell that hits you when you walk into THE hotel is great. I think they pump some kind of jasmine or something else, but it really refreshes you and is much more pleasant than the normal smell of a smoky Vegas casino. Speaking of the casino, it is just a short walk from the entrance to THE hotel and all of its noise is kept away from you. The Mandalay Palace is right by the entrance to the casino which gives you quick access to many shops, restaurants and ultimately leads you to the Luxor. If you have to pick one spot, eat at the Burger Bar. Sit at the counter too, to get served quicker. The Kobe Beef Burger was the best burger I have ever eaten. The pool is somewhat of a walk from THE hotel, but if you learn a short cut through the casino, it isn\u2019t all that bad. Be sure to stop at your local Target before going to this pool so that you can purchase a tube for the lazy river, otherwise it will cost you $20 for a Mandalay Bay tube. The wave pool is absolutely awesome, just be sure to get there early because it can get jammed up with children later in the day. It was an out of this world experience to be in the middle of the desert in Las Vegas and sit by a wave pool with a beach. The casino is very open and spacious, however the tables have fairly high minimums (no lower than $15 during the night and $10 during the day). I spent most of my time at the poker table, which was a very pleasant experience. The Sports book is possibly one of the biggest in Vegas. For food, all of Mandalay Bay\u2019s restaurants are available to you. The buffet was decent. If you go to it, be sure to have some of the chocolate candle cake, it was the best cake I have ever eaten. The Shanghai Lilly was excellent. My wife and I ate there on one of our last nights. It was a little pricey, but the meal is out of this world and the deserts will leave you speechless. My wife checked out THE bathhouse and said that it was an excellent spa, so I guess I would have to recommend that as well.

A family is going to react differently compared to an older couple compared to a single bachelor. Im 29, male and single and went with a large group of friends who got several rooms. I travel on business several times a month.I have stayed at the Bellagio, TI and others and found THE hotel to be the best. To start, if you have American Express you should definately book your room with them. I had received a considerable discount on my room compared to what my friends were paying via Expedia. On top of that I got a total of $120 to be spent in the cafe or restaurant and $100 dollars to spend at the spa. The best part of it was the room situation. They gave me the highet floor, 4 pm check out (which is crucial in vegas) and guaranteed me 2 queen beds. You would only get this through the Fine Hotels and Resorts Program with a platinum or black amex. The late check out is crucial because in vegas most flights leave later and you are stuck in the casinos on your last day. This is intentional and all my friends ended up cramming into my room on the last day. At the end of any vegas trip youll be exhausted and you definately want the room as late as possible. I travel constantly and the FHR program with amex is great. Ok, so the lines that people are writing about are actually not as bad as in other hotels. I checked in at primetime and there was NO ONE in line. When i checked out I had a 20 minute wait, which is nothing in Vegas. The only reason I checked out at all is I needed to split my charges, otherwise you just walk out and they check you out (there is also a drop box by the elevators to drop off your keys). The smells people are talking about are one othe best reasons to stay at this hotel. The aromatherapy is not unlike the smae one used by Sony in their mall stores. It is similar to the scents used in their bath products which are amazing also. I will say that on the last day my room reeked of cigarettes because somewhere on my floor someone smoked even though it was a nonsmoking floor. This is not the hotels fault, in Vegas stuff like that will always happen. I called, they offered to switch me and I decided agasint it since I was so tired. The people that work here were nothing but EXTREMELY professional and clean. I stay in many nice hotels, they were the best I had ever seen. The Ritz, the Bellagio, none compare to these people. The hotel itself is gorgeous, absolutely gorgeous. It is small, secluded and very elite feeling. Exiting an elevator to the sounds of a thousand slot machines is awful. I gamble, but I like the seclusion I feel in THE hotel. The distance to the Mandalay casino is about 100 feet and somehow they are able to completely hide the noise. The rooms are the best value in Vegas. I am used to being upgraded to suites in any hotel I stay in and I was concerned that since I was getting two queen beds (they only have regular, not V suites with 2 queens) that I would not like the room. I was VERY surprised and delighted to get such a room. It was clean and updated. This is in contrast to most rooms in Vegas (like the Bellagio) which are small, overpriced and too dark. We got a table at the club there called \"Mix\" and I have yet to see a prettier bar in my life. Its on the 60-something floor and has an outdoor area. It was gorgeous and I highly recommend it, and highly recommend you get a table outside, you are going to spend money anyway. I stay in hotels all over the country and Vegas.

We stayed in the basic 1-bedroom suite, which has a lot of upgrades: TVs in the living room, bedroom, and bathroom A guest half bath and a wet bar was also in the living area. I was amused by seeing variations of THEHotel brand on all of the things within the room: \"THEtp\" sticker on the toilet paper, \"THEpad\" on the notepad, \"THEdoodles\" on the large desk blotter. The only negatives were that the room needed a little maintenance. A lamp was out, one of the sinks had a stopper that wouldn't release, the shower temperature was difficult to set. Also, it's a very LONG walk from THEHotel to the Mandalay Beach pool area. The room decor was also a little dark and heavy for my taste. It was more masculine, i suppose. I wasn't sure if the duvet had a duvet cover that was washed after ever guest left, which made me a little leery of it. After having stayed in some of the best rooms at Caesar's and at the Wynn and Venetian, I suppose I expected more from THEHotel. I wonder if the fact that the living area and bedroom was separated by a wall and door, in addition to the dark decor made the living area especially feel a little small and a bit claustrophobic. But on the upside, the bathtub filled up fast, and the beds were very comfortable. The a/c was responsive. And there was a lot of closet space.

Had booked back in March based on much Internet surfing and with research and recommendation from several travel books (e.g. Frommer's). Had never been to Vegas before, and wanted the first trip to be special as my wife and I had never been away on holiday before without kids in 14 years of marriage (never had a honeymoon). Read all reviews prior to leaving on trip and frankly was getting a bit nervous before departure based on several bad reviews that seemed to have a couple of common themes (room thefts, poor service, smell, cost, etc.). Perhaps because of these negative reviews, we arrived at the THEHotel expecting to be disappointed. I can honestly say that we were NOT disappointed! Our room was fabulous! All of the suites at the THEHotel are essentially the same, so no need to discuss the excellent amenities such as the 2 bathrooms, double sinks in the ensuite bath, granite counter tops, large flat-screen TV's, 14\" flat screen in ensuite bath, etc. The furniture and carpet were in very good condition (unlike several reviews I recently read stating otherwise). I had booked a king bed suite, but tried the \"20 dollar trick\" at check in to guarantee not only a king bed but also a strip view on a high floor. We had a late check-in (near midnight), so I only half-expected the $20 dollar trick to work, thinking the hotel was probably close to full already. When the desk clerk asked for my ID at check-in, I pulled out my ID and credit card, clearly showing her the $20 bill. As I handed over the ID, I asked if there was any way she could GUARANTEE a king bed and a room that was high-up with a strip view. After checking, she said they were pretty much full for the night and could not, but she COULD certainly set it up in the computer for a room change the next day. She informed me all I had to do was call by 2pm the next day and they would provide our new room number. Given her cooperativeness, I offered her my credit card and the $20 tip \"for her extra trouble\". She accepted very appreciatively. Our room was high up (31st floor) and had a king bed, but it was only a partial strip view (it faced east towards the airport - the strip could partially be seen looking \"sideways\" to the north). Called at noon the next day to get our upgrade. Imagine my surprise when they claimed there was no room change documented in the system! They claimed that they do not guarantee views, only upgrades such as 2 queens to a king or smoking to non-smoking, hence the reason it was not in the system! I told them I was very disappointed because I was led to believe the change was all set up the previous night. I was put on hold for a minute and was then told they had a strip view for me on the 15th floor (really too low to see the strip around the Luxor). I again expressed how disappointed I was and felt I was led astray based on what I was previously told. Again I was asked to hold, after which they somehow \"managed\" to find me a strip view on the 33rd floor! We happily checked in to our fabulous strip view! I have to say that the 20 dollar trick itself was not successful, but my persistence and repeated expression of disappointment seemed to work in the end! With regards to the some of the negative reviews on THE Hotel I offer the following: 1)Service overall was pleasant and they seemed eager to help, although still not sure what happened with my original check-in. At check out, clerk was not overly friendly, but who cares? I was leaving anyway. Housekeeping was excellent! Never had an interruption and every day we returned to a perfectly made up room with all amenities replenished (left a nice tip in appreciation). 2) The \"smell\" that some have complained about is an incense-like aroma that they circulate through the air system. You may not like that particular scent, but all the strip hotels do the same with a variety of smells. Having said that, on our second last day in the room, we did catch a very faint \"sewer smell\", but it seemed to disappear in about an hour. 3) We used the in-room safe for all our \"valuables\" when we were not there, so obviously theft was no issue. Just common sense in my opinion... 4) The shower in our second room did have some problems maintaining constant water temperature (read other reviews complaining about the same thing). More of a nuisance rather than a complaint. 5) Location: If you are not renting a car, you may want to stay closer to center of strip to avoid walking or taking trams/other transportation. Walking down strip normally would be fine (outside of summer), but a bit tough in 110F heat dressed up for a show! We had a rental car and did not find the drive down the strip too bad except one night where there were 2 separate fender benders - took 1 hour from Mandalay Bay to Mirage. Also did several day trips (Grand Canyon, Hoover Dam, Primm, NEV Outlet Mall) and it was MORE convenient at THEHotel to get out of town. 6) Price/expensive: Found THEHotel a bargain for the room you get. Paid about 50% more (room averaged about $220US per night inc. tax) than I pay for a Super 8 or equivalent standard room in Canada in summer season, and THEHotel suites are far from \"standard\"! Food/restaurants on par with any other major hotel on the strip. If you want a bargain, go to Freemont Street downtown...you won't find many ANYWHERE on the strip itself! 7) Casino overall seemed to be less crowded than most big hotels on the center of the strip (especially week nights). If you want high-energy and action in a casino, Mandalay Bay is probably not the place for you. If you like a quiter, less crowded atmosphere, gamble here. 8) Nightlife: Did not really partake in the club scene, but the \"rumjungle\" club seemed to be the place to be. It was as popular or perhaps more so than any other club I saw on the strip - weekday or weekend. 9) THEHotel Entrance: Not \"grand\" like the other hotels on the strip, including Mandalay Bay itself. In fact, it's a downright shabby entrance via the parking garage. However, I would rather pay for the room I am staying in instead of the marble and architecture at the revolving door! Overall, loved THEHotel. If not for a couple of minor issues, would have ranked it a 5/5. Would definitley stay here again, but probably won't next time in order to try out something else on the strip for comparison purposes.", "Date": "August 17, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Plano, Texas", "Title": "\u201cTHE Best Hotel in Las Vegas\u201d", "Author": "MVSRMom", "ReviewID": "UR8422465", "Content": "This was our first trip to Las Vegas and we didn't know what to expect since we had our young children with us.

When you walk into the lobby, it's peaceful, serene and smells wonderful! There's no smoke and loud clanking noise of the casino nearby (although there is one). The wave pool and lazy river were a huge hit with the kids and the adults. There were also other standard type pools if you want quiet and distance from the crowds. It was hard getting the kids out of the lazy river -- it was a lot of fun! You should definitely buy a donut float locally and take it with you. I bought one at a toy store on sale for $2.50. I needed another one when we got there and couldn't find one anywhere at the stores near the hotel. The hotel sells a basic one for $16.00 or you can rent a nice one for $20/day. The downside was that the pools were a good walk from the hotel and they don't allow you to bring in a cooler. It got really hot and was hard to keep the kids hydrated on lukewarm bottled water. But, this was a small inconvenience compared to the wonderful time everyone had. All the rooms are suites and very clean and spacious. The extra 1/2 bath was really nice to have and very convenient. The main bathroom was large and comfortable.

We have stayed many places and have visited during each of the 4 midwest seasons. This was our 2nd stay at The Hotel and 5th to the Mandalay Bay complex (2 other times at Mandalay Bay itself and once at the Four Seasons). It seems to me that the cost of everything at The Hotel has increased ... including the topless pool (Moorea Beach Club). Breakfast inside The Hotel will set you back $35/couple; lunch at Moorea Bay is about the same; drinks during the day poolside is $100; access into the pool is $50/male and $10/female; and everyone associated with The Hotel has their hand out waiting to be tipped. You would think that if you stayed at their property you would have free access to the nightclub (The Mix) - but you do have to pay $10/person on Friday and Saturday nights. You also get to wait in the common folk line while every other VIP person goes into the club before you. Health club access is $20/person if you only use the exercise equipment - if you want to use the spa facilities, throw in another $15/person - so now you are out $35/pp/day. Want a massage - buck up another $150. The cost of the rooms are higher than that of the Four Seasons, and while the rooms are very nice, how often do you really need an extra room with a couch and second bathroom? For two people, this seems like a waste ... but I already knew this going in. Met great people at the Moorea Beach Club - but two other girls and me were the only ones that were topless. The bulk majority of girls keep the tops on. Not a show stopper - but you seem somewhat out-of-place in a place that was designated for European sunbathing. The other girls I chatted with said that the Wynn and Caesars have many other European sunbathers and do not charge a separate access fee. Check-in this time was smooth, however, we asked for a view when we checked-in and was given a room on the 8th floor. It was a great view of the parking deck. So we went back to the front desk and they re-assigned us to the 38th floor. Much better view the second time around.

We took taxis from the airport, and they took us directly to the separate THEhotel entrance away from all casinos/big crowds. The lobby is sleek and modern, with high ceilings and minimalist decor. We walked straight to the registration desk and did NOT even have to wait in line! The only minor issue is that our rooms would not be ready until the afternoon. However, the bell-hop took all of our bags with no hassle and brought them to our room when it was ready. The staff was quite friendly, so no complaints! 2) THEhotel is smoke free. Yay for our health! 3) Two separate bathrooms is a major plus, especially with many people in the room! Overall, the amenities in the room are fabulous, BUT we did have issues with the wireless at times. 4) Many of the restaurants in Mandalay Bay are VERY close to THEhotel entrance. I highly recommend making reservations for dinner. However, for one night, my party decided to switch at the last minute from Italian to Chinese, so we ate at Shanghai Lilly in Mandalay Bay. We didn't even have to wait 1 minute, and the restaurant was very accomodating with our last minute requests and food substitutions. 5) Room keys will each get VIP/front of the line access for up to four friends per key at Rumjungle nightclub in Mandalay Bay. Rumjungle has amazing decor (waterfall walls, cool lighting) and the DJ usually plays hip-hop so it's a pretty happening dance floor. The bellhop at THEhotel even hooked us up with free passes, so we didn't have to pay the $20 cover! THEcons: 1) The room lighting is poor. When you have several girls wanting to get ready at once and the bathrooms are full, even with all the mirrors on the closets, it's hard to find good lighting to get ready, apply makeup, etc...Better lighting would help with the practicality of the rooms. 2) The sofa in the living room is NOT a sofa bed.

Well he first began is saying (before he told us of no dbl rooms avaliable) that he was going to go check with his boss about a possible upgrade. And I was thinking that there was no real upgrades since the V Suite only had king beds and the Suite is the one that carried both dbl & king. Well I was mistaken, he came back and told us that there were no double rooms and that he could accomodate us in one of the Penthouse Suites but it also only had a king bed. He offered to put in a rollaway and there was a couch in the room that could be made into a bed. He could not put in two rollaways because of fire code. Well then he sweetened the deal by giving us a 100.00 food and beverage credit to apply to any Mandalay or Hotel resturants. We took him up on his offer and agreeed that we would take the Penthouse and then move the following day into to dbl room if we wanted to.

(where btw, at MGM it could take you 15 mintues to walk to your room) The Room, is great a 2 room suite, with 45 inch flat screen tv's 1 1/2 bathroom. Fantastic.

Also, for those people that are looking for service I have to say, I bet it is difficult for a hotel with 1000+ rooms to accomadate and please everyone's taste.

We were in THE hotel at Mandalay Bay. We arrived the day before Memorial day so it was very busy as you can imagine. It was 97 degrees and the bar tenders did not want to give the patrons wanting water any ice. The line for drinks was huge. They need more staff on weekends/holidays and a better way to get us water. Their cafe by the pool had huge self serve containers, like a cooler or something. Thats a great idea. The pool was beautiful of course. It has a wave pool and a lazy river. There is a shallow area by the wave pool that you can sit in to cool off, that was nice. To rent a tube or raft was 20.00. The cabanas are 250.00 per day and all you get for free is water and soda. There is a very good restaurant, The Border Grille, outside by the pool. It was delicious but very pricey, $42.00 for lunch, and that did not include any booze! This hotel is huge. It took us the 4 days we were there to figure out our way around. My other complaint is that after 2pm all blackjack tables were 15.00 per hand. They were only 10.00 at night at the Bellagio for cryin out loud. We did not gamble much there for that reason. We went to Luxor, Monte Carlo, MGM. One of the dealers and the pit boss yelled at me for sitting in a chair at a empty blackjack table at 1am while my husband was playing roulette nearby. Breakfast buffet was 15.99 per person. To use the gym/spa was 27.00 per day. Our room was awesome. We got a deal on it. Overall, everything was more expensive vs The Mirage. If you are someone who does not care if you spend extra, then great. We love it at The Mirage and the location is better so in the future we will go back there.

I work at a hotel and know this kind of thing happens, especially since we were coming in so late (1am), but the problems didn't stop there... When we got up to the room, the maids were still cleaning it - they opened the door, told us it would be one second, and then shut the door in our face.... I was in shock. A couple minutes later, they came out, and we went into the room... We asked for 2 roll-away beds since there were 4 of us, and were told at check-in this would be no problem. When room service came up with only one roll-away, we told them we had asked for two, and they said OK. About 20 minutes later, they called and said they couldn't bring up another roll-away, it was a new hotel policy they could only take up one. Also, the room smelled of smoke and we had asked for a non-smoking room, again it's Vegas so I wasn't surprised, but it was still unpleasant. So, two of us went down to the front desk - we asked if there were usually maids in the room when guests were sent up, why our room smelled like smoke, and why a second bed had not been sent up. They assured us our room was non-smoking, that tomorrow we would be switched to a non-smoking two queen room, and were told that they had talked to housekeeping, and another bed was being sent up.... 30 minutes later after no bed was sent, we called the front desk... at that point they told us no bed was being sent up, that whoever told us it was had been mistaken, and that we could only have one roll-away... this was almost TWO HOURS AFTER CHECK-IN and around 3am. Disappointing, to say the least. We did get switched to a smaller, two-queen suite the next day - one which had no smoke smell whatsoever. Both suites we had were really great, loved the bath products, decor, etc., and we were pleasantly surprised by room service as well - they were prompt, accurate and friendly. However, we had problems again at check-out w/the front desk. Upon check-in we had asked for a late check-out since our flights on Monday weren't until 5, and check-out is 11am - again, they told us no problem. On Monday we woke up around 11am and called the front desk to re-confirm our late check-out.

If there is but one reason to go to this hotel, it is for the size and luxury of the rooms. They are gorgeous suites that are over 700 square feet. There are 3 flat screen tv's, 2 bathrooms, a giant bathtub, and a spectacular view of the strip. It is nice to have two rooms separated by a door so that you can watch tv and not disturb someone else who may wish to sleep! I have stayed at numerous hotels in Las Vegas, and these are by far the newest, sleekest, and nicest I have seen. I definitely recommend requesting a \"high floor with a strip view\". Otherwise you get the opposite side of the strip which is a bland desert view. Anything above the 30th floor will give you a nice view with your floor to ceiling windows to boot! It's a delight when you come back to a darkened room at night! I have read a number of reviews regarding the smell of the hotel. This is a matter of opinion, of course, but I loved it. It created a very \"zen-like\" atmosphere with all of the beautiful white floral arrangements and the dreamy music they play throughout the hotel. The Hotel provides a nice retreat from the casino vibe. It's the whole package. To my surprise the smell comes from a \"spray bottle\" that they spray the carpets with. And, everyone of course loves the pool at Mandalay Bay. You have access to all of Mandalay's amenities as a Hotel guest. To my dismay the \"beachside casino\" was not open yet. I was told it would be open June 8th, and it was no where near completion when I left on the 9th. So, I ended up at the Moorea Beach Club which, to my surprise, was a topless beach club. It was $10 for women and $50 for the men to enter. (My husband opted to hit the craps table instead) But, there are some new cabanas and bungalows that are also open now that look like a great deal of fun. The bungalows at the beach club have a small grassy area, negative edge pool, big cushy beds, etc. I believe they go for $3000 a day. I actually saw John Mayer lounging about in one of them so you never know who you might see! Also, the main bar at Mandalay Bay is under construction. This was also a small disappointment as it sets the tone for the whole Mandalay atmosphere. Now it is a giant walled-up square in the middle of the casino. So, no big place to lounge, no live music in the center, etc. A bummer. : ( I have to say the room service was amazing at The Hotel. The french fries were to die for, and the breakfast mango sorbet was delightful. We figured with what we had comp'd with our players card, that at least one of our room service meals was free. Be sure to get the \"Players Club Card\" so you can get the comps. Lastly, you must head up to the Mix for a drink after sunset. There are big brown square couches where you can nuzzle up on the balcony and watch the strip. Try to get there at a reasonable hour because seating fills up quickly. Oh, and be sure to check out the bathroom... quite an experience. I do not recommend dining at the restaurant however. The food is mediocre, and if you are in heels, it is dangerous to walk around on the wooden planks that they have for a floor out on the patio! I found it to be a restaurant that is trying too hard. It's all very aesthetically pleasing and all, but really not a top Las Vegas restaurant. If you want 5 star dining then go to Le Cirque! It's the best!

Of course we knew that check-in was not till 3pm but we were hoping 1 of the 2 rooms were ready so we could leave our bags and change to our swimsuits to head to the pool. The rooms weren't ready but they said the bell hop could take our bags, however we were not allowed to the pool without a room key. We said we understood but we were guests there and going to be staying all weekend so couldn't they give us a pass to get in so we could spend some time in the sun? Well no they insisted that they couldn't. We were furious. We ended up checking our luggage with the bell hop and then he was able to give us a key to get in the pool area. So we got our swimsuits out and went in the hotel bathroom to change into them. We then went outside before 10am and the pool was already packed. There were hardly any chairs left. We finally found some but were not happy. There were kids everywhere, sand was getting into everything. We were like what in the world? Well 3 of the girls walked around and found out about the Moorea Private Pool. They looked inside and it was 21 years and up because it was a topless pool but you didn't have to go topless. It cost 10 bucks to get in for women. So we decided to do that because there were no kids and it was much nicer. As we were packing up our stuff to move one of the guys came up to us and gave us wristbands to get in. WOO HOO!! So we headed that way. WOW......much better. We hung out several hours ordering food and drinks and relaxed. We were finally able to check into one of our rooms by 12:30 so we just all piled our things into the one room so we could clean up to go shopping until the other room was ready. It wasn't until much later in the afternoon that there room was ready. We had requested multiple times to be close to each other, but of course that wasn't granted. Friday night we did eat at Mix on the top floor and went to the Mix lounge for cocktails afterwards. A wonderful experience and great meal! Housekeeping was always available and brought up things that we requested. Our shower leaked bad as well and the lighting was horrible with several lights out.

Construction going on, and workers gauking to see who is taking their bikini tops off. If you bring kids, for whatever reason people do, to Vegas, you'll probably like the Mandalay Bay because of the wave pool, lazy river, etc. If however, you are coming with a girlfriend or wife, and you appreciate luxury and class, The Wynn is the only place to look. Shopping and food are exceptional. Pool is the best. Clean, classy casino. Not a snobby place, just very nice. The Hotel building itself and the rooms are not bad, they are just not great. The casino, and pool areas are substandard. I will say the spa there is quite nice. The bottom line problem with The Hotel is that they don't have their own pool and casino. They built it after the Mandalay Bay, and while the vibe is very cool, it doesn't flow with the cheesy Mandalay Bay. They have two different sets of clientele, but then they throw them all in the same pool area, with pool attendants who have no clue what they're doing.

Fair prices, and supper lunch and breakfast, and its right on the way to the pool. We went off the strip to eat at our old favs, such as the great Italian \"Hole in the Wall\", and Paris Buffet. We ate at a fancy Italian restaurant at Mandalay Bay, and it was good. Shows...check out what bands are playing at House of Blues, and we saw \"Crazy Horse\" topless show at MGM. Crazy Horse was fair. Check out Elton John or Prince if they are playing when you are there, everyone says those shows are incredible. Well, I have nothing but good things to say about THE Hotel, except that they are understaffed at the pools for drink orders, and please correct the sewage smell!

I booked two rooms at TheHotel at Mandalay Bay for $179 each. This rate was lower than other travel websites and lower than the hotel's direct website for the specific date I needed. In addition, this rate included: 4pm late checkout, two $20 breakfast certs per room, potential for an upgraded suite if available and a $100 spa credit for services for each room. WOW. When my associate and I arrived at TheHotel at 10 am, the bell desk took my two suitcases to a storage room. The front desk rep advised one room was available and he confirmed that I would have a 4pm late checkout. I was provided with the keys to my room, my associate was advised to call the front desk later in the day to see if his room was ready. I provided the front desk rep with my luggage tag and asked him to send the suitcases up to the room. We both went to my room for about fifteen minutes, we then decided to leave, even though the luggage had not arrived. I wrote out a large note to the bell desk employee and left the note along with a $5 tip on the table. In addition, I left my itinerary for the flight the next day, my dinner reservation confirmation sheet, breakfast certs, minibar key and some other paperwork on the side table next to the couch. My associate left his duffel bag containing his clothing in the room. I also placed several of my credit cards into his duffel bag. We left the room and returned at 3pm. When we arrived back in the room, my associates duffel bag was missing-including my credit cards, along with the $5, and all other paperwork. Furthermore, my two pieces of luggage were not in the room. I called the front desk immediately and was transferred to security. After a brief investigation (10 minutes) I was advised that the room was cleaned and that his duffel bag was in Lost and Found. I was obviously concerned that my credit cards were missing and asked for an explanation as to why the attendant had cleaned the room when it was clearly occupied and we had checked in. The response was, it \"appeared to be an error.\" I asked that my luggage be delivered to the room along with my associate's duffel bag. I'd contacted a concierge service months prior to the trip to set up a special dinner reservation for 5pm that night. It was now 3:15 pm. At 4pm, I called the front desk again to find out why we had still not received my luggage, his duffel bag, replacement breakfast certs and his room key. At 4:15 pm, my luggage was delivered along with his duffel bag and his room key, but no breakfast certs. We were wearing resort attire and needed to change into business casual after showering, etc. It was obvious we weren't going to make dinner at 5pm since it was at least a 15 minute cab ride, not including the wait and we were still in shorts/tshirts. I called the concierge service and fortunately they were able to move the time back to 6pm. A bit of a hassle on my part stemming from TheHotel's error and very slow service. We went out to dinner, when we returned, I had to call the front desk again for the breakfast certs. The Breakfast the next morning was wonderful, two of the four certs were used and greatly appreciated. The next day, we both utilized the spa credits toward several services. My associate left TheHotel about noon to catch his flight. I called the front desk as a courtesy, since a large event was in town, to advise that his room was now vacant and to verify that I had a 4pm ck out. It was confirmed. I went out for a while and returned to my room at about 3pm to gather my luggage for my 440pm flight. My two keys did not work in my door. I was very concerned that I was going to have another bad experience at TheHotel and I was under time pressure since airlines advise arriving at the Las Vegas airport at least two hours prior to departure. I called the front desk from a hallway courtesy phone (I was on the 29th floor, a walk to the front desk would have consumed several minutes and when I walked through the lobby earlier, there were at least 25 people in line to check in). I was advised that even though I had a 4pm ckout, the computer system had automatically checked me out. I needed to wait for security to deliver me a new key. Based on my hour and fifteen minute wait yesterday, I was very upset and concerned that I was going to miss my flight (I'd booked a first class seat and didn't want to be assigned to coach-or lose my seat on this Memorial Day holiday weekend if I ck'd in late). Plus, I had other travel arrangements for the next day. I waited 15 minutes for security to arrive with a new key, a front desk staff member also arrived at my room. I expressed my concerns about my flight and the previous day's several incidents. They made no attempt to offer expedited transport to the airport and provided me with a basic apology for being locked out. I hustled to TheHotel taxi line-without stopping for a copy of my bill even though I need it for my tax records because the front desk line was again very long and I was in a rush; fortunately I made it to the airport on time. The room rate and package of benefits was really great; unfortunately, TheHotel's many service related issues created several stressful situations. Even though the I enjoy the d\u00e9cor of TheHotel, I won't return for quite some time since my overall impression is that they have many service glitches. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------", "Date": "May 31, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington DC", "Title": "\u201cBad Price/Value relation/Great spa\u201d", "Author": "DCTraveler95", "ReviewID": "UR7724874", "Content": "The property grounds are really beautiful but I had two bad rooms --- the first had dirty carpets and noise from a compressor that sounded like a toilet flushing every 5 minutes.

I have stayed in the top hotels there and almost all in between. My most recent stay at The Hotel was the absolute worst in my 10 years. I did arrive with an open mind and blank canvas. However, my first opinion was that this place has a very, very dark atmosphere. I mean everything is dark, from the winding parking garage entrance(yes, your entrance to this hotel/first impression is a parking garage), the lobby, and the dim rooms themselves. Even the bathroom lighting was extremely dark(so ladies, if you like having light while applying make up, look elsewhere). A very dark and somber place. The staff here seem very apathetic- riding on the large numbers of tourists that come to Vegas. They made mistakes on my reservation, then placed me in a room with a non functioning safe. Fixing that problem alone took an hour out of my vacation! How many of you enjoy a nice warm shower? I know I do, but I could NOT get one at this hotel. I had to constantly play with the temperature if I could get hot water at all ! For all you light sleepers, the hotel constantly has wind noises that sound like a blizard in your very own room. To top that, the wind is often accompanied by the sound of plumbing from all your neighbors! I love a nice pool, but there pool is a good 3/4 to a mile away to get to. Once there, it is a zoo of people and kids. I tried to find some positives at this hotel, but could not. Even the staff from bellmen to the cleaning staff do not seem happy here. Needless to say, I will not stay at this hotel in the future. It is sad because I used to be one of the Mandalay Bay's biggest fans.

It was phenomenal. I checked out Tripadvisor along with Frommers to get a really good cross section of the hotel options. THE hotel fit the bill. It wasn't in the middle of all of the craziness of the strip but not far either. THEhotel is contemporary and definitely for people that enjoy minimal design rather than ostentatious fabrications of roman sculptures that are double their real size. It really felt like the whole hotel was non smoking but in fact I was told the ventilation system is the best at Mandalay, and it showed, as a non-smoker I really appreciated not smelling the dusty air in the casino or anywhere in the hotel for that matter. The crowd was definitely more refined and less \"trashy\" and \"tourist-y\". It was definitely a mix of 25 to 45 years of age. The suite was exactly how it had looked on the website, and i had called weeks earlier to confirm we had a good view of the strip. The maids were very nice, I asked one on our way out for extra face cloths and she left a dozen upon our return! THEhotel restaurants were gorgeous, The Mix especially. The view is breathtaking along with the hand made murano glass chandelier they have. Other dinner options I would recommend is Bartolotta di Mare at the Wynn (plan reservations well in advance), Lawry's Prime Rib and Alize on the top of the Palms. These are all exceptional restaurants, and the quality of service is outstanding. The best buffet above all is at Paris. Nothing else compares. NOTHING. I went to the Mandalay Buffet and that was decent, and MGM was just \"ok\". The BEST lunch / dinner you'll have that doesn't break the bank is The Cheesecake factory in the Forum Shops at Caesar's Palace. The portion sizes are ridiculous and the cheesecake is unreal. Make an effort to see the outlet malls, it's worth the $15 shuttle because you find amazing deals. The Fashion Show mall is out of this world also, 7 different department stores...imagine? Don't think you h ave to eat in the hotel restaurants either, we went to the Bali Hai golf course very close to Mandalay for lunch and had the best lunch and their lagoon patio is gorgeous. Definitely \"O\" at the Bellagio is the best show to see. Don't bother with Carrot Top, unless you like ridiculous prop humour. I didn't see Lance Burton (magician) but I heard very good reviews.

The trip was for business. I arrived at check-in and was informed that there was a \"situation\" at Mandalay Bay. They said that I had been upgraded to The Hotel. I've been wanting to try The Hotel so it was a pleasant surprise. The Hotel is perfect. I was in room 60-806. The view is from the 60th floor over looking the pool. The pool is nice to look at, as is the reflection of the tower in the Mandalay Bay and you still see a lot of lights across the desert. There is also quite a bit of rooftop, but it wasn't distracting. I do think it might have been more fun to have a view of the strip, but the view was certainly very pretty. The decor is very typical of a nice boutique-style hotel. There is a great Jacuzzi tub, Bulgari bath products and even a scale. Try the bathtub soak that is provide...it is worth your time. The linens and bed are very comfortable. The hallways are serene and very quiet. The wireless worked perfectly and was $11.99/day. The robes and slippers are a must-try! :) The cable system is pretty limited. Obviously most people traveling to Vegas aren't spending a lot of time in the room watching TV, however I thought HBO would have been standard. The coffee bar and bar off the lobby are a nice, quiet place to meet friends or co-workers away from the casino. You should note that their restaurant closed at 3PM during the week. It is good to note that on The Hotel side valet you can call down and they will have your car waiting for you. (They won't do this on the Mandalay Bay side.) They also offer you bottled water which is a nice touch. Parts of the pool are still under renovation. I've always been a fan of the adult part of the pool where you paid a small fee and it wasn't crowded like the other areas. That section was still not open as of April 10th. You should also be aware that if you arrive around noon-2PM...you are going to have trouble finding a place near the pool. Just keep walking...there is a smaller pool at the very end of the pool complex that seemed less crowded. I had a great experience and can't think of a thing I would change about this hotel.

Despite the fact that I spend little time in the room when in Vegas, it is very nice to have a nice place to go to for those few peaceful hours you may spend. And this definitely fills that bill. It great to have a true suite with separate living room and bedroom areas, particularly if you have to share the room with someone with different sleeping habits. Now, I wouldn't necessarily put it up with the quality of the Ritz Carlton-type hotels, but definitely upscale. And while the price tag is a little higher than the average Vegas hotel room, you are paying much less then the Wynn or Bellagio and the like, for their comparable room (a suite) - so I think it actually a pretty good value. I also like the quietness of the \"casino-less\" hotel lobby - you have to walk through the connecting corridor back to the Mandalay Bay main area to the casino. I don't know why some people complained about bad service, but I had great service in every aspect of the hotel. Note that the pool is still finishing their construction and is as crowded as ever.

THE hotel has no casino (it has a corridor that connects to mandalay bay), so it is smoke free. A huge plus because so many other las vegas hotels have the registration area and/or room elevators adjacent to the casino. A tip - your quickest access to mandalay bay pool and the Rum Jungle nightclub is by exiting the main entrance to the hotel and walking left to the valet parking entrance for mandalay bay. this not only saves you distance and time, it enables you to completely bypass the mandalay bay casino. our only negative experience: the front desk staff. we checked in around midnight and were told that they had no rooms (we'd reserved). they offered us an upgrade to a penthouse suite in mandalay bay. when we told them we'd prefer to stay in the room we'd booked, one of the other front desk clerks proceeded to lecture us about how great the penthouse suites at mandalay bay were and how she'd love to stay there. we gave in because we were too tired to argue. after staying the night in the mandalay bay suite (the interior design inspiration for which was apparently was Tony's house in The Sopranos), we insisted on being moved to The hotel. We were intially told that it was sold out and that, besides, we'd been \"upgraded\"...we stood our ground and were moved. lesson learned: stand your ground. just remembered 2nd negative experience: a \"working girl\" sitting in one of the recessed areas in the wall outside the room elevators trolling for customers. very surprised to see that in this place (saw her again in the connecting corridor next morning at 6 am). but, i suppose that can happen anywhere. having said all of that, we're definitely returning because the positives FAR outweigh the minor negatives", "Date": "April 10, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "wayne,pa", "Title": "\u201cabsolutely wonderful hotel for mother-daughter trip and some other comments\u201d", "Author": "simmie17", "ReviewID": "UR7293500", "Content": "Stayed at The Hotel for 4 nights in early April with teenage daughter.

Amenities were plentiful We used the Internet connection each day- worked fine. I used the Bathouse Spa 3 times. It was so peaceful and restful. The services were excellent. Mandalay Bay itself was impressive. We ate in the Burger Bar once and it was very good. Cannot say the same for RM Cafe- very expensive and seafood was not up to par. Had much better meal at Joe's. Crab Louie salad was exceptional. Border Grill though was great. We ate outside our last night. Best Mexican food we both ever had. Tried to get a chair at the pool one afternoon but it was packed. Pool facilities looked ok but too much of a scene for me. Enjoyed the bar at Mix - the staff there was the most personable I encountered. The view is incredible. Also learned there may be a strike in June because of union issues with MGMGrand. Hope it is resolved. As a first time visitor, had also considered staying at Bellagio or Wynn. As to the former, I did not care for the ambiance there when we went there to see O. As to the latter, it was very beautiful - and very crowded. Shopkeepers were pleasant, except for woman in the Chanel store. (Interestingly, the woman in the Chanel store at Bellagio was also rude, as were personnel at the Louis Vuitton stores- that may be part of their employment contract....) I had rented a car based on advice on this site. Upon reflection, I am glad we did only because we went to the outlet at Primm one day. (OK mall- daughter loved the Miss Sixty store) I think a car is a good idea if you are leaving the Strip- otherwise, forget it. Driving in LV is an absolute nightmare- worse than NYC. On the other hand, found the whole cab situation ridiculous. The Taxi Authority should allow you to get a cab at more sites. Overall we both loved LV and The Hotel. LV was packed with kids of all ages. This is probably a good facility for families, but saw kids everywhere.

Overall, we enjoyed our stay and would recommend it to anyone. To be fair, here are a few negatives: 1. We requested housekeeping to not come before 3pm (my husband had some work to do in the mornings) and on our second day they didn't come at all. We called to get some fresh towels and toiletries and it took them around an hour to bring them up. However, they must have sensed the annoyance in my husband's voice because they brought up a bag filled with toiletries. 2. When we got to our room, the carpet was totally damp and had that icky wet-carpet smell, probably from cleaning. Actually, the entire floor that we stayed on smelled that way. The positives: 1. Great room- three tvs, trendy decor, awesome bathrooom, and they provide a great bath powder. 2. The spa (The Bathhouse) is conveniently located on the 2nd floor. I went there the second day and the Mandalay Bay Spa the third day. I prefer the latter but The Bathhouse is pretty visually stunning. However, their \"eucalyptus\" steam room consisted of a worker popping her head in and squirting her spray bottle full of eucalyptus scent into the room. 3. The hotel has a quieter, chill vibe than the frenetic Mandalay Bay. My husband and I had a great stay and would definitely stay here again.

The room was clean and pretty, though like other reviews, it was indeed dark and somewhat gloomy, so I wasn't all elated as I had expected to be until we came back to the room at night and saw the impressive lighted strip view. The tvs had problems with volume and distortion and the channels were limited. It seemed like almost every channel was a promo guide about the hotel. The bathroom did have a lovely deep tub which could easily fit two it seemed. I used the bath powder the 1st night but it was not replaced the second day. The shower was nice looking but upon inspection was filmy on the showerhead and in the corners, like calcium deposits. Also, the seal on the shower door was peeling so I stepped onto a nice soaked bathmat upon exiting shower. We joked also about how much the 'body balm' smelled like Pledge! Speaking of smells, the whole hotel had intermittent patches of a fowl, sewage smell, especially on our floor, though luckily our room did not. I also felt my nostrils burn immediately in the elevator, which is a sure sign of air conditioning overload. My amex card offered guaranteed 4pm checkout, and even though I called downstairs to remind them of this, I still got a knock on my door at 11 from the maid, then another maid asked me again when I walked out of my room at 12 and I explained again. Then when we went back to get our stuff to leave at 3:45, our room key had de-activated and wouldn't open. I went down to the front desk and he just stared at me blankly and eventually handed me a re-activated card key and a checkout bill. For a 'luxury' hotel, they could have at least said something, like sorry for your inconvenience, or, your bags are still there dont worry....I had to ask all the questions and make sure I wasn't being charged for the day. I am being pretty negative but I still enjoyed the room to some extent, the mini bar was relatively affordable and it was nice to have a mini fridge. The maids were friendly and smiling, even though no one told them about our late checkout. The bathrobes and slippers were a nice touch too, and of course it always feels nice to be in a 'suite'. We ate at the Cafe and the food was good even though the waitstaff was not very attentive and they forgot our drinks until after the food came...At 'The Coffee Bar', the food and coffee were good too, but they really need some management help...the girls messed up my drip coffee order twice and were fighting with each other about the orders in front of the customers..I didn't care but still was not a great first impression, and all the customers were rolling their eyes waiting. On a side note, I had enjoyed the main Mandalay Bay's brunch a few years ago, but it has gone downhill...with lots of fried foods and unappetizing appearance. Maybe I was spoiled by the previous night's excellent buffet dinner at Bellagio. That was awesome and around the same price! Back to TheHotel...For me, a fan of minimalist and modern design, even I felt this hotel was lacking in a bit of warmth, and it all seemed a bit narrow and crowded and dark. It was less cheesy than some hotels, design wise, but I was much more impressed with the Wynn when we walked through. Wynn was bright and colorful, but still strangely modern and chic. I will hold out for a Wynn promotion next time. Oh, but we did see Dr. Drew getting out of the elevator at TheHotel, so at least there's some credibility for you...", "Date": "January 31, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Buffalo, NY", "Title": "\u201cFor those who want style instead of glitz\u201d", "Author": "mod3rntraveler", "ReviewID": "UR6714057", "Content": "I cannot say enough how much I enjoyed my honeymoon in Las Vagas because of this hotel.

I belong to the MGMMirage slot club and called to see what I kind of a weekend deal I could get on a couple of rooms at Mandalay Bay. I was pleased when the casino desk advised that I had a 2 night comp at THEHotel I could use for one room. The second room there would have been a fortune even at casino rate, so since this was a true 1 bedroom suite, I figured the 3 of us would be fine in one room. I had been erroneously told that the sofa was a fold out bed. It isn't. So I did spend a few less than comfortable nights on the sofa. (We asked for a rollaway on check in when we discovered that the sofa wasn't a fold out. It didn't arrive on our first night. When they brought one the second night, a few hours on that lumpy torture device persuaded me I was more comfortable on the sofa.) This hotel does have a masculine decor. I didn't mind it, but it is sleek and cool rather than charming. We did not have much of a view. And I have to say that if that was a plasma tv in the living room, it was the worst plasma tv on the market. The screen was big but the picture was grainy and blurry. They don't get too many channels either. For these prices, they need to upgrade to HD. Aside from those issues though, this is a top quality room at a top quality hotel. It is very comfortable and spacious to relax in, the toiletries and amenities are top notch. We found the service to be quite good in all facets, and dinner at the Mix was pricey but absolutely divine. It is a young hip upscale crowd for the most part. Other people I knew who stayed there warned that it was a journey to the casino, but I really didn't think so, and I liked coming down the elevator to a peaceful lobby instead of din and smoke, especially in the morning. It would be a very long walk to the pool, but the weather wasn't conducive to pool lounging so that didn't affect us. Some of the restaurants are a mile away (i.e. Border Grill in particular) but so what? Half the fun is the people watching. The Mandalay has by far the best restaurant and bar selection of any property in Vegas. It is always a treat to try something new, and it would take quite a few visits to exhaust all of the options. We liked \"Red\", Rumjungle, Border Grill, and especially the aforementioned \"Mix\" I really like this resort, and would recommend it to the younger crowd who like to party more than they like to gamble, or to honemooners who plan on spending significant time in the room. The club was obviously popular, and the crowd was great looking, and largely drunk. For video poker players like me, the pickings are slim and the paytables lousy. I got lucky on some stupid slot machine though, so I broke even in the casino. This is not a place I'd recommend for someone who plans to gamble for long periods. It is not particularly comfortable, and the table limits and slot selections are crummy. Nice sports book though. It was a great trip, and good time had by all of us.

The Bay is a nice place to stay if you want to be away from the action a bit when you are ready to relax. It never gets as crowded as the casinos in the center of the strip. They were doing remodeling at the sushi bar portion of the casino, which was sad because I love sushi. Other than that I didn't notice anything out of the ordinary. My only complaint with the Bay, and this will stop me from every returning, is the comps have gone downhill. They are now completely part of the MGM/Mirage universe which means they have a much more corporate culture/numbers crunching approach to comps. It used to be much better. I played at an average of over $300 per bet according to their stats and that didn't warrant complete coverage of my room and food/beverage. Their stats were also a bit off as they showed I lost 1800 but I lost a lot more than that. Not sure how I could have only lost that with an average of 300/hand, my luck is not that good. I still was charged for one night of the room, some food as well as the mini-bar. I tried to get the last $350 I was charged taken care of but they said I was already overcomped. The fact that I had to call to try and nickle and dime over what was only one bet based on my play is ridiculous. Same thing happened to me at the Bellagio earlier in the year, and they are both MGM/Mirage properties. The Bay has never given me grief with comps in the past.

We have previously stayed at the Bellagio and the Venetian in Las Vegas and liked \"THEHotel\" the best so far. (They like to brand everything \"THE,\" pronounced as \"thee,\" to include the spa (THE Bathhouse), THE pad for notes, and up to the little sticker on the toilet tissue saying \"THE TP.\" Some folks might find it pretentious or overly ironic, but we just found it amusing.) We booked via an Orbitz package with air and hotel and were upgraded by the hotel to a corner suite (number 17916--rooms ending in 917, 816, and 817 are also corner suites). Standard suites are on floors up to 23--the first two digits in the room number--and luxury suites are on 24 and higher. The hotel website has good photos of both. The room was quite large, although the corner rooms lose a little space due to the curve of the bedroom wall for the extra windows. There is a separate sitting area with sofa, easy chair, and coffee table as well as a wet bar area and a separate half bath. There are flat panel TVs in both the sitting area and bedroom as well as a smaller one in the bathroom, which has a double vanity (with good storage space), separate tub (luxury suite tubs are jetted) and large shower, and separate toilet. Good amenities (their brand, also for sale in THEBathhouse), nice towels, and sheets. Did have to ask for a bathrobe and then they only brought one although the hotel was not busy--at least the initial couple nights of our stay. A very comfortable and functional suite. Maybe because of the extra windows in the corner suite, did not find it dark as other reviewers have said. Used the spa for several treatments as well as the gym. Both were very nice and had great service. Prices were reasonable. You can also book to use the spa at the adjoining Mandalay Bay (much larger, lighter in colors but also nicely maintained and serviced) and at the also adjoining Four Seasons (did not book there as prices about 30 percent higher for treatments than at Bathhouse or Spa Mandalay). Marcia and Michael give very nice deep tissue massages at Spa Mandalay and Penny gives a nice facial at THEBathhouse. Did not eat at THE Coffeebar (used the Starbucks at entrance to Mandalay Bay casino) or THE Cafe, but did eat at the House of Blues in Mandalay Bay, Cafe Georgio in the Mandalay Place shopping area, and THE Mix restaurant on the top floor of the hotel. HOB was fine, Cafe Georgio quite good, and Mix excellent. Had no line at check-in but should have asked for written print-out of what was included in our package from Orbitz as it differed slightly from the hotel's own promotional package (two-for-one spa passes instead of two complimentary spa passes--which cost $30 per day if not booking a service over $50, for example). Line for check-in on Christmas Eve was massive, however. We had several issues to resolve on check-out (due in part to differences in understanding of what was included) but they were resolved very professionally and amiciably by the staff. As noted in other reviews, the hotel's front entrance is via the parking garage--it's a little confusing on entry, but if you check out the map on the hotel's web site you will know exactly where to go. It's great not to enter via a casino and the lobby is quiet and modernly elegant.

I did online research, sought personal advice from friends who have been to Vegas before and came down to a short list of two for my hotel choice. It was either The Signature at MGM or The Hotel at Mandalay Bay. In the end I chose correctly and booked at THE HOTEL at Mandalay Bay. After a 12 hour flight, arrived just after midnight on a Friday at THE HOTEL, looking forward to the start of a Restful and Romantic stay. The Hotel is a short cab ride from the International Airport (approx USD15.00) It is true that the approach to the lobby is like driving thru a service entrace/multi-level parking garage. Although no bell-hop or doorman greeted us we walked confidently into the Hotel's entrance and wheeled our way to the check in desk at the back, passing the coffee bar and cocktail bar. Seemed very chic, elegant and nice energy. CHECK IN: Without a moment to spare, could not wait for a shower and to hit the bed for some rest after our long flight, ony to be told at check in that \"WE ARE OVER BOOKED-we can only offer you a room with a rollaway\" Well, my smile dropped to the floor, like a fine crystal glass to marble tiles. My specially planned trip is being undermined by bad Reservations Management. I had paid a deposit in advance of coming and also commented on my late flight arrival at the time of booking. The Checkin clerk offered no other alernative. As embarrased as I was when I saw the look on my partner's face at his disappointment, I asked from the Front Desk Manager. I was told that she would tell me the same thing. I asked again, insisting the she tell me. After a [----] and some flarring of nostrils and stamping of feet, my suite miraculously became available on the 36th floor. SUITES: As advertised, all the trimming I was expecting. Very nice, elegant, contemporary and comfortable with adequate lighting. The draw of the curtains revealed an amazing Southward view over the suberbs of the city to the mountains and also a view of the runway (I like airport observations) Room was extremely spacious, well appointed, good amenties however, no coffee maker which I found odd. BEDS: Although I had requested a KING BED for my Anniversary trip I had to settle with two Queens (no comment) nut the bedding was indeed very comfortable. Great rest was earned. LOCATION: THE HOTEL is at the Southern end of The Strip and off the busy Casino of Mandalay Bay. This was a good thing for me, away from the gawkers which the others hotels attract and noise of the strip . The Monotrail from the Mandalay Bay thru Luxor and Excalibur is a good headstart to entering the strip. Access to/from LAs Vegas BLVD and I-15 is easy and away from the traffic associated with the Strip. A CAr Rental for out of town exploring will work for this location quite easily. Dollar Rent a Car is at the Mandalay Bay-Beach Level. RESTAURANTS: One of the highlights of our trip is fine dining. It is for this reason that we like London and New York City so much, especially NYC. I have discovered that Las Vegas is quickly becoming a Fine Dining mecca with many celeb chefs and high end designers creating new rendy restaurants, like NYC. Overall, the design element was great but the food quality fell short and the prices much higher than a midtown meal. We ate at: MIX (For the actual Anniversary Dinner) reserved via Opentable website. Staff were very attentive, all acknowleging the special day. The dining room is spectacular and white. The window seat we got had awesome views from the top of THE HOTEL. Food was 7 out of 10 and our dessert came with HAPPY ANNIVERSARY scrolled out in choclate on the plate. We also ate at FAT BURGER on the Strip for a quick burger but HAVE THE MILKSHAKE (This is a diner). Dinner at FIX at The Bellagio after O was good, nice trendy mood, another 7 out of 10. Then lunch at BURGER BAR for healthy gourmet burgers in the Shops at Mandalay Bay i a must....8 out of 10. We tried only one buffet (not our style of dining-but when in Rome...) The Buffet at THE BELLAGIO was our choice..... 7 out of 10. On the last night we ate at STRIPSTEAK at Mandalay Bay which was probably the best meal 8.5 out of 10 (we were walk-ins) so could have been seated in the lounge. We ate breakfast everyday at THE CAFE off the lobby at THE HOTEL which was very nice always. MANDALAY BAY has a great selection of restaurants including Red Square, Lupo, Rum Jumgle, Areole and Flyr de LI (spelling) you could not want for anything else. Overall: Bellagio was best casino and hotel lobby for people watching. Checkin desks always had long queues as did taxi lines. Venetian seemed the most difficult to navigate and the Gondola ride captures my RIP-OFF prize. The Italian accent was wrong and the lyrics to the song was wrong to add insult to injury-Tourist Trap!!! Danicing Waters at Bellagiio is mesmerizing. Shopping was ok at FASHION SHOW MALL just next to Treasure Island and opposite the WYNN. We also drove to Las Vegas Fashion Oulet at Primm....that was a wate of time. Best find for shopping is at FRIES on South Las Vegas Blvd., about 1 mile South of Mandalay Bay. A techie heaven, it is like BETTER THAN BEST BUY. SHOWS: Booked in advance to avoid disappointment> Saw KA at MGM which was good but preferred O at Bellagio which was awesome 9 out of 10. Also recommend BLUE MAN GROUP at The Venetian, and Bally's Jubilee for the real Vegas showgirl experience...aslo include the backstage tour here. And last but not least, the highlight of my trip was THE HELICOPTER TOUR OF THE GRAND CANYON, LAKE MEADE and HOOVER DAM. I called ahead of my trip to the concierge at Mandalay Bay and they recommended either Amverick or Sundance. I eventually booked via Air Vegas, using one of the Sundance Tours. A courtesy white limo arrive to pick us up for the short drive to the heliport. A small check in terminal and gift shop was comfortable and the pilots were personable and conducted the tour well. Five of us were on our 945am flight and we were able to alternate with who got to ride infront with the pilot. The Canyon was beyond words spectacular. Once landing there, you are just one in touch with nature. AWESOME. Wished we had more time there to absorb. Great picnic basket and light champagne was offered. Return flight brought us in over the Strip. Hotel-Hotel was 4 hours. Well worth the money. Can also recommend adding the rafting opion, but in warmer weather. (BOOK IN ADVANCE) Sundance was very professional and excellent Customer Service. And all this was just on a action packed 5 day trip. We don't gamble!

The staff on the front desk were very helpful. When we first checked in they did not have a strip view room but they arranged for us to be moved the following day. As the hotel is at the end of the strip you get a perfect view of all of the other hotels. Definitely ask for a high floor / strip view room. If you don't have a view y(or even if you do) you should head to the bar on the top floor. Very slick indeed. This hotel is very good for escaping from the hustle and bustle of Vegas. You do feel slightly away from the centre of activity but we really enjoyed being able to go out, enjoy the fast pace of Vegas and then escape back to our sanctuary. The only disappointment was the cafe in the lobby. We were served by a very grumpy and unhelpful waiter (the only one we came across on a 3 week trip) and the food was average.

BIGGEST COMPLAINTS: NO COFFEEMAKER IN ROOM! UGH! VERY DARK ROOM! HARD TO FIND OUR WAY AROUND CASINO & RESTAURANTS~! ONE, GIANT MAZE! Our first impression was not good. As we entered a VERY large parking structure, the mixture of DIESEL fumes and SEWAGE was nauseating! It was not easy to find where to park - we drove around a bit before entering the sewage/diesel fume-filled structure. As we carried our bags into THEhotel, we weren't sure if we were even in the correct place. Mandalay Bay is right next door and we didn't know if we were at Mandalay, or at THEhotel at Mandalay. There were no visible signs pointing to either hotel. As we walked past the casino, we were utterly clueless as to where to check in. After finally stopping to ask, we were pointed in the right direction, though it was like a three-hour tour trying to reach the check-in desk! Add a few corn fields and it would have been a great maze! Check-in was simple for me, however, the other party we were with didn't have it so good. Her reservations were not in the computer at first, and when they were finally found, she was given the runaround about receiving the same \"goodies\" that we got (she booked the identical package (thePleasures) at the same time we booked our package ($250 shopping coupons, 2 free passes to Shark Reef and 2 free passes to the Spa). After pleading with the clerk, she finally got her goodies, but, the clerk had to add \"you're not supposed to be getting these\" as if to say she was doing her a favor (and to get the last word in). After all of that, we were sent to separate elevators (we were on floor 32 and she was on floor 15). We tried to get rooms next to each other and were told they were not available. THE ROOM: VERY POORLY LIT! Bring your flashlights and Coleman lanterns because you will need them in order to see anything! The beds were very comfortable! Nice bedding, warm and cozy! The TV in the bathroom was awesome, and the two PLASMA TVs in the living room and bedroom were great! Pay per view movies were standard in price (10.99 and 11.99 for the two we watched), but what was great is that they have \"not yet released to DVD movies\", which was a treat! The mini bar had lots of goodies, which is great if you want to pay $30 for a 1/2 bottle of wine! The Pringles came in handy for my kids though. Very noisy party going on the night of November 22nd. I woke up at about 1:30 and all I could hear were people laughing, and music, which seemed to be coming from downstairs somewhere! Bring ear plugs. Thanksgiving night was better. BATHROOM: In the bathroom was a scale that didn't work. Thank goodness for that! The bathrooms were the only well-lit areas (great for visualizing all of the imperfections). Great, DEEP tub, and a wonderful, magnifying make-up mirror (to see ALL of the wrinkles!) Actually, I really liked the mirror! The plasma TV on the wall was a PLUS! Just don't drop the remote in the tub! Shower was just okay. HOUSEKEEPING: There were no robes (but there were slippers) in our room - had to call to have them brought up. Housekeeping was very prompt w/ the robes, as well as extra shampoo and bath stuff! Once we got the robes, we discovered they were worth the wait! VERY HEAVY AND PLUSH! NICE! Housekeeping was very generous w/ extra bath stuff, too! They were nice, in general. ROOM SERVICE: We arrived at about 3:30, and had driven from California, so, we had a \"snack\". The kids ordered mango smoothies which, from what I could tell by the empty glasses, were GREAT! My husband and I split the Vietnamese beef summer rolls which were served w/ a spicy peanut sauce and were VERY GOOD. We also split the mozzarella/tomato/balsamic plate which was OUTSTANDING. He had a beer and I had a Ketel One Citroen Martini, which was wonderful! Room service was reasonably prompt, and, not too unreasonably priced for the amount of food that was served (we weren't hungry after spllitting the two hors d'oeuvres). CASINO: The casino was smoky, but, I've been in worse. I hate sitting in it! It would be nice if there were a non-smoking section. I also hate to drag my kids through all of the second hand smoke, but, you have to, in order go get around. The casino doesn't use money. They use paper vouchers, which worked just fine, until went to cash out and my voucher got stuck. I had to wait by my machine for a good 10 minutes before tackling an attendant for help. I practically had to run and jump on him to get him to come over to my machine! There are not nearly enough attendants on the floor. However, on a positive note, the casino was not overly crowded (except for the tables, which is the case everywhere you go). SHOPS: WAY overpriced and not enough diversity in selection. I am from Manhattan Beach, CA. We know shopping here and we know that many places are pricey. Almost every store in this place was HUGE $$$$! RESTAURANTS: Buffet for breakfast on day 2. Not great! Good price, however. 13.99 for adults. 10.99 for kids. If you are the all-you-can-eat type, this is for you. We aren't. We go more for quality than quantity. The bacon was repulsive (though that might be redundant). I took a bite and looked for a napkin to spit it in. It was all fat - disgusting! The oatmeal was runny and slimy. The eggs weren't from real hens. They had to be from silicone hens. They were unreal in appearance. I didn't bother to try them. The omelette bar was way too crowded to attempt. The fresh fruit actually looked good. There were crab legs which were split down the middle. I didn't have any. I love crab, but,, for breakfast? My husband had them and said they were good. The service was good. The coffee was great! RAFFLES: We had our 2nd breakfast here and though the service was very slow, the food was OUTSTANDING. Bacon, eggs, fresh fruit, coffee, ALL WONDERFUL! RED, WHITE AND BLUE: We ate dinner here. I had the chicken noodle soup & a lemon martini. It was fantastic. I had them add a Matzo ball to the soup because I've never had Matzo ball soup. The Matzo balls were gross, but, I'm not a conneisseur. The kids split spaghetti, which was fantastic! The man had a burger. He said it was great. Later, we got ice cream to go, from there. My kids said it was the best Cookies and Cream ever! STAFF: Overall, nice, accommodating. Not overly friendly, but not rude. FOOD: Stay away from breakfast buffet! ROOM: Dark! Noisy on first night. Very comfortable, though. WOULD I RECOMMEND: No. Though the suites were lovely (smallish, though, for a suite), clean, comfortable, and definitely worth $150 per night, I would not recommend it simply because it was irritating trying to figure out how to get around the casino and restaurants, and, the rooms were cave-like dark! Very difficult to read, or see anything other than the TV! One other downer was that the beach and lazy river were closed, and I was not informed of this when I made the reservation. WOULD I GO BACK? Possibly. We will try the Bellagio next time (we ate dinner at Sensi on Thanksgiving. Very, very expensive, but, great food). For $150 a night, THEhotel is certainly upscale; lounge, nice coffee bar and beautiful restaurant right off the elevators, which was very convenient. Walk a little further and you'll hit a Starbucks!

The suites are a very good size, especially if 4 are staying and ideal for families with the tv's in every room. With regards to the quality of the picture on them - no problem and to be honest who comes to Vegas to be a couch potato? The beds were sooo comfortable after long days to the extent of when got home went out and bought a new bed. Rooms were very clean, the only concern was when we first went into our room the previous occupants had eaten/drunk from the mini bar and tried to cover their tracks but from previous experience we always check so we dont get charged, this was rectified with 1/2 hour. Although TheHotel does not have a casino in the reception it is a pleasant change in Vegas. The walk to the pool is further than you expect but it is worth the walk.

I travel 75% of the time so I've seen my fair share of hotels. At first I was critical in my travels...but after 5+ years of living on the road, it takes alot to disappoint me as well as impress me. We arrived on a Thursday and stayed until Monday. VALET / DOORMEN: We had a driver from the airport so I can't really comment on valet parking. I can say the taxi cab line was minimal throughout our stay, which is awesome for Vegas. I don't recall any doorman, but will all the madness out \"front\"...who could tell. I don't expect to have a glam arrival to this hotel. The \"front\" doors ae located in a parking garage. It's hot, sticky and full of exhaust fumes. However, once inside....you quickly go from drap to fab in the blink of an eye. Lobby is exactly like photos and yes, the front desk is at the end of this super long catwalk, I mean hallway. We arrived fairly late (11pm) so there was no wait...another rarity in Vegas. CHECK-IN The reviews are 100% accurate ! A-T-T-I-T-U-D-E and for no reason.....Puuuuleaze people !! Check-In wasn't a breeze but I anticipated that. After 20 minutes (remember...there was no wait)...we were off to our room. Down one hall over to the other, past the ultra sleek bar (which was playing football or some other sports thing on the TV's...totally not appropriate). GUESTROOM Again, just like the photos...stunning, everything you need, everything you expected...bathrooms are sexy, towels are fluffy (another rarity in hotels everywhere). Only Con....ever tried to get dressed in a nightclub? The lighting makes anyone gorgeous....but when your getting dressed, you want to see all the flaws that need to be corrected. The lighting in the rooms, including bathroom, are the WORST. I don't want a halogen light...but I bulb over 40w would have been nice. HOUSEKEEPING Very clean and like magical fairies....you never see them. Room was spotless when we got there and each day we returned. Hats off to them ! POOL The pool is literally less than a 5 minute walk. If you can't do that without huffing and puffing, this high-end fashion hotel is probably not the right fit for you (or your body). Mandalay Bay pool rocks...THE END! There isn't a pool like it in Vegas. We experienced the \"private pool\" this trip too. Oooh la la...recommend it too....but not to the huffy puffy folks who complain about the walk. SPA Even though it only takes a few elevator stops to reach....it's a WORLD away from reality. Friendly staff who had good reason to throw attitude, but didn't. Bathhouse totally raised the spa bar in Vegas....can't wait to go back !!! LOCATION Now, this is the only \"complaint\" I have about the lovely THE hotel @ Mandalay Bay. On the baseball diamond of Vegas....this hotel is over the fence, past the parking lot and barely in town. Okay, it's not that bad...especially if you rely on drivers or taxi cabs (which we did in the evening time). The few times we did venture to the strip I wish I had worn my sytlish sneakers vs. some trendy thing. Down the elevator.....over to the pool....thru the pool compound (which is HUGE and great when your laying there...not enjoyable when trying to walk thru it)....thru Mandalay Bay....down the drive....viola, your finally at the strip. At the end of the strip....but your on the strip. ONE LAST NOTE.... I totally shouldn't bash the location. For those have been to Vegas a hundred times....but yet, have never been to the world famous \"Welcome to Vegas\" sign. The sign is literally 2-3 minutes from the front drive of Mandalay.

Until the W Las Vegas arrives, this is it. theHotel at Mandalay Bay offers a nice alternative to some of Las Vegas's other casino hotels. Although the property is attached to Mandalay Bay, guests don't have to contend with a casino being at the lobby level. This can make a huge difference when traveling back and fourth to your room. Depending on the nature of your visit, the general location of this hotel can be average to somewhat poor. I prefer being more central to local happenings, bars, restaurants etc. Mandalay Bay tends to be somewhat removed from most of these outlets, so closely look at the map before booking. One plus is that the hotel is just a stones throw from the airport. This property features an all suite concept, which will ensure that you have plenty of room to stretch out and get comfortable. With few exceptions, rooms are almost all identical to each other. The standard layout is approximately 750 sq. feet, with a division between the bedroom and living room. Rooms are equipped with two queen beds or one king. Standard suite rooms have one main bathroom with a separate shower stall and tub, which serves as a nice feature. In the living room area, you will find an additional half bath which is nice when sharing the room with multiple people. Rooms are equipped with a plasma tv in the living room area, desk with fax machine, wet bar with minibar and sink, couch, and chairs. Rooms at theHotel are well appointed with a nice contemporary residential feel. Having stayed here several times, I have always been impressed by the accommodations. In fact, I am generally partial to the Four Seasons brand, but I must say that theHotel has more impressive rooms than the Four Seasons Las Vegas. Beds linens might not quite be as nice, but the room in general is. If nice rooms and a semi-private feel (compared to some of the other mega resorts) is what you're looking for, than I would most definitely opt for theHotel at Mandalay Bay.

Here are a few things that I wasn\u2019t satisfied with. \u00b7As we drove into Valet, a bellboy didn\u2019t show up right away, so we unloaded our luggage out of the car. As we were ready to walk into the hotel, a bellboy showed up and loaded luggage into a cart. As we walked away from him, he said, \u201cappreciate it.\u201d We sensed right away that he said that because we did not tip him. However, I\u2019m glad that I didn\u2019t tip him for less than expected service and to someone like him whose ironic attitude toward customer was not acceptable. \u00b7Although we requested a room with 1 king size bed, as usual, the front man said that the only available room was a room with double beds. I know that room type is not guaranteed. but frequency of not having rooms with 1 king size bed is far often than other hotels we\u2019ve stayed at. Although the front man said that he would check availability of king size bedroom next day, we never received a call from the front. I\u2019ve seen many times here that the front promises to call you next day but they never do. \u00b7Their computer system was down, so it took longer to check-in. \u00b7Inside our room, 4 light bulbs were out (again, a usual pattern). So the already-not-enough-lighted room is dimmer than ever. I didn\u2019t even bother letting the maintenance/service know since the old bulbs never got replaced despite of my requests before. \u00b7Our room didn\u2019t get made until 6:30 pm one day. My husband had to call to have it made when he returned to our room evening time. The room somehow doesn\u2019t get made even though no one was in the room most of the day. No \u201cDo Not Disturb\u201d light was on either. This is a usual thing at this hotel. When I deal with workers at THEhotel, I truly don\u2019t think workers there are trying to make guests\u2019 stay easier or more pleasant.

For comparison purposes I've also stayed at MGM and The Wynn. Overall I can't find much to complain about, but I also can't think of a lot of good things to say. The entire stay was average. First, I'll describe the look and feel. This is a modern, dark hotel. We were frequently looking for 'one more light to turn on' inside the room. And speaking of rooms, I had a huge problem with the bathroom. It was impossible to keep the shower at a constant temperature. I experienced this each morning, as did a couple co-workers on different floors. The same angle of the faucet handle would either be scalding or freezing, dependant upon some unknown force. It made 5 minute showers last nearly 15, as you'd have to step out of the way and fiddle with the temperature, back and forth, back and forth. The bed was comfortable. The room views are average. You're either looking south or west at the Vegas suburbs, or you're looking at the back of the regular Mandalay Bay or the Luxor. You're not going to find a really nice view of the strip from any room here. The rooms do have multiple widescreen TV's, but it certainly isn't anything close to HD. This is simply a rather cheap large television with a coax signal. The picture is very average. Plus, who watches TV in the shower? I'm not sure how that got started, but it's useless to have a TV next to the bathroom mirror. The Mandalay is the furthest south of the big casinos, and thus it seems to be a little quieter and more secluded. You're not going to want to walk a lot of places from it, you'll be taking cabs or the tram. If you want to wander around, stay up near The Bellagio or Caesar's. Housekeeping was fine, room service was fine. Had a drink at the quiet bar in the lobby, and ate at \"THE Cafe\", which was expensive, but great service.

First the valet parking at arrival was so-so, they let us wait quite a long time despite the fact that there was no crowd checking in or out, we arrived at about 3 PM. Check-in was ok, was offered an upgrade to a bigger suite for 20 US$ a day more, but declined. Room didn't disappoint, since it was as advertised a nice big suite, with a wonderful bathroom with separate shower stall, lightning as mentioned in previous posts was poor. I requested a room with a strip view and was able to get one. So far so good, now to the less good: Service at this hotel is horrendous, it feels very pretentious and the staff let's constantly feel you in what nice hotel you are, and that is the best hotel in Las Vegas, and that it is an honour for the guest to be served by them. Couple of things in the suite didn't work properly and were never repaired. Worst of all is their housekeeping service, which doesn't show any coordination at all, the culmination of problems was that on the second day wasn't made despite the fact we left the room by 12 PM and they had a lot of time left, their housekeeping service only runs from 9 - 5, whihc in my opinion for a self proclaimed 5 star hotel or best hotel in Las Vegas is rather poor, no turndown or second housekeeping service is being offered, just plain miserable, we even had a hard time getting some fresh towels. Restaurants at the Hotel are so-so, not so good, and the MIX in my opinon, while good, is heavily overpriced. Combine this with the rather poor location at the south end of the strip, we decided to check out 3 days earlier that planned. We opted for the Mirage, where we received a very good deal, while the rooms clearly can and are not in the league of the Hotel, the property is much better run and their service and attitude is so much nicer.

Staff was friendly and efficient, although I tend to like seeing as little of the staff as possible. The check in however was quick, friendly and the room cleaning crew did a good job. The pool area is great although crowded on the weekend day we went by. One downside for some is that the Hotel is located at the end of the Strip. It's a major walk to the core say around Caesars. We however found plenty to do at the end of the Strip, lots of restaurants and clubs and used the free tram to get as far as the Excalibur when we ventured further. I found it relaxing to enter the darker, quieter area of the Hotel from the ubiquitous casino noise when returning to the room.

We were hoping to have a few days of luxury before returning home. We'd never been to Vegas, and were told we had to see it once before we die. Once turned out to be more than enough! The city was just too over-the-top for us, especially since we aren't big gamblers or shoppers. But THEhotel was a perfect choice - very impressive looking with marble everywhere and huge crystal vases filled with white flowers. The staff was efficient and friendly. When we booked the room they were careful to mention that it was \"only a room\", not a suite. When we checked in we were again told it was a room (with no mini bar). We were picturing something like a broom closet, but upon opening the door, we discovered it was far from just a room. The bed was king-size. A huge armoire hid a large flat-screen TV as well as cozy robes and fuzzy slippers. The gorgeous and spacious marble bathroom had his and hers sinks, a jacuzzi tub and a shower along with plenty of high-end toiletries. A separate little room held a toilet (with a phone). The best thing was the view - we were on the 61st floor and could see most of the strip and watch planes taking off from the airport. There is a comfortable clubby bar, a coffee shop/cafe and a restaurant downstairs as well as a very hip eatery and bar called Mix on the 64th floor. It's also quiet - there's no casino at THEhotel, but the property is attached to Mandalay Bay which does have one, as well as a pool area that could be accessed with our hotel room key. The wave pool and \"lazy river\" looked like a major attraction - we avoided it as it was busy and crowded. We walked the strip several times during our stay - it's quite a sight at night!

I decided on this hotel after many hours reading Vegas hotel reviews and ignoring many friends and colleagues advice to go to the Bellagio! Here's my opinion for what it's worth! - THE ARRIVAL - dropped off at the rather unimpressive entrance inside the parking garage - no doormen/bellboys/staff of any description to be found even though it was 3pm in the afternoon. But sometimes it can be nice not to have all the fuss and rummaging for tip money. Found the well hidden front desk - I agree with the other reviews - a sign would be helpful! Did have to wait - but I had expected this. When we eventually made it to the desk the very nice but confused lady was unable to find our reservation and was unable to contact anyone else to verify our booking. She wanted us to pay in advance for our whole stay until our booking could be found! She eventually realised that she was looking for the wrong name despite being given our prepaid hotel voucher with the correct name on. Anyway - not a big deal really but I am a fussy tourist and do like everything to be perfect! THE ROOM - 35th floor - side on view of the airport with an angled view of the strip. Not bad. Had a King Size Suite and found it very homely, clean, stylish and welcoming. As a designer and a Virgo I can be VERY particular (much to my boyfriends annoyance!) but really couldn't find any major fault. And yes the bed was perfect! Thank god there was no furry brown undersheet or suspiciously stained overblanket! THE CASINO - While I found the strong air freshener a little overwhelming after a couple of hours this was nothing compared to the strangely pungent aromas of the other casinos! The atmosphere though was nice and less tacky and cramped than many other casinos. Not a big gambler and a newcomer to Vegas I did still manage to lose money on the cheaper slots machines - but I never expected to win - just enjoyed some of the more modern machines which were fun to play (such as Star Wars). THE POOL - Yes it was a little walk to the pool but nothing to break a sweat over. If you get there early (before 11) you will get a sun lounger. You can even hire a private cabana with air con, tv and fridge if you have money to burn! Liked the little pools but found the beach area to impersonal and noisy. My personal favourite was the lazy river - where you can find a nice quite spot - with shade or not and just either enjoy the sun or have fun swirling around the lazy river. It might be nicer if they could turn down the music which competes with a couple of bars and restaurants and can be a little annoying if you are near a speaker! THE FOOD + DRINK - Didn't go to the mix or eat in the cafe or any of THEhotel place as I found them a little overpriced and pretentious. Loved the Buffet at Mandalay Bay which is perfect for breakfast! Tried Raffles but was a little overpriced and the atmosphere was strange. I would avoid the left hand part of the Red, White and Blue restaurant (can't remember which colour that was) as it was quite dirty and tacky compared to the other places. TRANSPORT - Found the free tram (at the front right hand corner of Mandaly Bay Casino) really useful as it gives you great access to the MGM Grand which is only a couple of bridges over the roads after the last stop at the Excalibur. Don't bother with the Excalbur or the Luxor - v.tacky, smelly, run down in comparison. OVERVIEW - Apologies for the length of this review - You should stay at THEhotel if you are in Vegas for more than two nights as it is a great place to come back to at the end of the day and being part of the Mandalay Bay means you have 24 hour access to the nice casino and other amenities.

We made reservations 2 months in advance for $499 (Fri), $499 (Sat), and $299 (Sun). A little pricey since Las Vegas in my opinion is getting too big and service suffers. For that kind of money, I expect excellent service in every area of the hotel. We got a tip from a family member 2 days before we left that the published prices for TheHotel had dropped. We checked their website and they in fact did. Prices were now $299/$299/$169. Very large difference. So I made a call to the reservation desk at TheHotel, told the less than happy to be at work female who answered the phone what I had learned, and she promptly made the change. Saved over $500 which I later lost at the Casino anyways but had more fun losing it. TheHotel takes a very different approach to check-in. You are actually dropped off inside the parking garage where the front door is hidden from public view. Greeted very nicely by the staff. Walked inside and was happy to see we didn't have to walk thru the casino to find the front desk. Very Nice!!! Tried to find the front desk but could not since there are no signs. Not Good!!! Found the front desk only when we saw a line of about 20-25 people. Several who were voicing their discontent on the wait. We waited and were greeted by a very nice young lady who took care of our check-in with courtesy and professionalism. I glanced back at the line which was now longer than when we arrived. I also noticed only about half of the check-in stations were being used. Much like at your local bank or grocery store!!! This area of TheHotel needs a major fix in customer service fast. Sets a bad tone. Total check-in time was 26 minutes. As for the rooms, very nicely decorated and clean. The previous reviews about the televisiions do not lie. Reception is fair at best.

Sure, it's nice to have a plasma TV, but be aware that this is a ultra low-end model. I have an LCD at home that cost under $1000 that has a far better picture than this. Of course, part of the problem is the usual substandard hotel cable system. On top of that, the set wasn't set-up properly...set to stretch the picture to fit the widescreen and no way to \"un-stretch\" it. There's really no sense in having a widescreen TV in a hotel that's not equipped for HiDef (pretty much EVERY hotel.) It's just there because the designer thought it would look cool. On the other hand, they do have a DVD player...we happened to have a couple widescreen DVDs with us and they looked pretty good. Also, the sofa was chosen for style rather than comfort. And the whole living room seemed a little cramped. But if you're here on business, it IS a great office space, with a huge desk, comfy chair, Fax/printer. Only drawback is the charge for internet access- at this price level, it should be free! On the other hand, you don't go to Vegas to sit and watch TV. And the bedroom is nearly perfect. It's actually bigger than the living room. The bed is the most comfy I've ever been in- period. There's also a very nice 35\" (or close to it) tube TV- it's actually better than the Plasma. (Sorry, I'm a video producer, so I pay attention to the TV.) I've read some reviews that say there's two Plasma screens- either they don't know what a Plasma is, or some rooms have Plasmas in both rooms. The master bath is equally perfect- almost as big as the living room with giant bathtub and a glass shower bigger than an NYC studio apartment...perfect for-ahem-couples. There's a small LCD TV that doesn't really work well (typical), but even I don't care if there's a TV in the bathroom. If you're there on business and need to check the stocks while you shave, it'll work fine. We had stayed at the Mandalay Bay before, and it was February, so we didn't go to the fantastic pool, but I understand it's quite a walk. On the other hand, you are just a few steps from the parking garage, and a few more from the theater and casino. The hallways are sleek and silent, and the whole thing just oozes cool. Other \"fancy\" Vegas hotels are too gaudy...less is more at \"THE Hotel\" Note- everything is VERY dark, from the furniture, to the lighting, to the tint on the windows. Speaking as a middle class, average guy...If you can get a room for under $200, it's well worth a stay, if only just for novelty. I think the good features wouldn't seem as nice if I was paying $300 or $400. Go for an aniversary or special occasion...have a nice dinner at one of the many good restaurants onsite, see Mamma Mia or a concert at the House Of Blues, have a nightcap at Mix, and retire to your perfect bed. But it's not the place to go if you just want a nice place to sleep. You're better off just getting any 4 star off Priceline or Hotwire. Or if you do have $400 a night to blow on a hotel room, the Four Seasons is probably a safer bet.

What follows is my experience from start to finish. It may be lengthy but I want to make sure I cover everything. Location: The Hotel is the last hotel on the strip. So plan on taking cabs everywhere. The Hotel's main entrance is in an indoor parking garage. It is not the typical grand entrance that you normally see in a major Vegas hotel. You do not have to walk through the casino to get to your room. This is the sort of laid back, private atmosphere that the hotel is going for. Rooms: Absolutely gorgeous!! As mentioned in other reviews the rooms in the hotel are all suites and quite large. They are extremely modern, spacious and quite glamorous. Other travelers have mentioned that the rooms are a little dark, but this is the modern and swanky look and feel that the hotel attempts to achieve. The beds are super comfortable and the one and a half bathrooms really come in handy when there are multiple people getting ready. Pool/Beach: The pools and \"beach\" are sort of far away from The Hotel. If I could have taken a cab there I would of. We ended up spending all our days at the Moorea beach club, which costs $10 for ladies and between $40-$50 for the guys and you have to be over 21. We were lucky enough to make nice with the staff at the beach club and were never charged to get in. We did tip the staff nicely so maybe that had something to do with it. I do warn that the line for the beach club does get long on the weekends, and they continue to let people in when they aren't seats for them. Our last day there we spent the morning at the wave pool and at the pool on the right hand side when you first enter the pool area. Both areas were really nice and relaxing. Vegas Nightlife: During our stay we visited Rum Jungle, Red Square, China Grill, Tao restaurant and nightclub, Tryst at the Wynn Hotel, and Mix. We ended up at Tryst everynight of our stay because we just had so much fun there. We danced the night away by the waterfall and had so many laughs and the pics to prove it. Tao restaurant at the Venetian was delicious and the night club was ok except that it was extremely packed. Some of these places are a bit hard to get into and the lines on the weekend can get really long. So either be prepared to wait or offer the bouncers money. We ate at Mix which was the priciest of all the restaurants we ate at but the view is amazing. The Mix lounge area is a great place to start or end the night, since it is in The Hotel. One of my favorite places was Red Square, where we got to take a couple of shots in the vodka freezer. The freezer is a chilly 4 degrees so ladies are offered fur coats to put on to stay warm. It really is a fun thing to do and provided the perfect backdrop for memorable pictures. Rum Jungle also offered great portions of food at a decent price. Overall, I had a great time at The Hotel at Mandalay Bay. I would definitely recommend this hotel. I wouldn't mind staying there again, but not sure if I would only because I prefer the hotels more towards the center of the strip, like the Bellagio or Caesars. I also didnt care for the long walk to the pool area, and I enjoy hotels where I have to walk through the casino in order to get to my room.", "Date": "August 29, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Haverhill, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cLoved It!\u201d", "Author": "s25843", "ReviewID": "UR5712108", "Content": "Let me start off by saying that I am a Hilton Honors Gold VIP member, and a Starwood Preferred Guest Gold Member.

I stayed at TheHotel for 2 nights on part of a multi-hotel Vegas trip. Rate: $159/$149 a night. Service: At check-in there were probally about 25 people in line, however, the line looks longer than it actually is, since you are forced into standing in a long hallway. The check-in agent was very efficent and found us a room on the 32nd floor with a view of the strip. The Bell dept was also very friendly and efficent and offered to help with everything. Rooms: The rooms are large 750 square foot suites with a large master bath with Tub, Seperate shower, 2 sinks, and an enclosed room for the toilet. There is also a smaller 1/2 bath with a vanity and toilet. The living room has a sofa, table and sitting chair, desk with a printer/fax machine, office chair, and a 42 inch plasma TV on the wall with a DVD player.

The entrance is nice. The lobby is nice. Access to the pool area was annoying. (long and cumbersome walk). The valet was annoying. (leave me standing there for 10-15 minutes and look all angry at me for not tipping, well, duuh). The check-in counter was a mess even though we checked in on a Sunday late. It seemed like most the staff was being trained on the job, which I guess explains a lot. When we got our room it was sort of dirty. There was someones luggage stickers in the garbage can (same date as we checked in - someone else was there and left the same day??). Used qtip in the drawer, very few toiletries. Hmmm.... Room service was soggy - seemed like evrything had been boiled. I'd guess they keep 'em warm some how. Not nice. (fairly priced @ approx 100$ for 3 burgers and softdrinks incl. fee's). Room quality was way nicer than Mandalay Bay, but we are not talking 4S or LHW standard here. Bellagio and 4S are much nicer for Vegas. Ofcourse room rates very cheap. 250-280 pr night incl. taxes for a large suite (900 sqft). During our 3 day visit housekeeping never made it to our room. We hunted them down for towels and toiletries. TV's (both of them) had bad reception, and the inhouse movies had a weird sound control so either things were LOUD or sound was off. I asked at the front desk to have the A/C fixed (very noisy, on and off), but no one ever made it to our Room. All in all - at the price - very good sized room / interior.

The best part is that every room comes with two bathrooms (a necessity when a few girls are getting ready at the same time). Unlike the Venetian, rooms are the same price whether you request a king or two doubles. 2) The spas- When staying at The Hotel you have the option of either The Bathhouse, Spa Mandalay, or the Spa at the Four Seasons. They are all great, but i recommend the Bathhouse because it is so modern and a great place ot just relax even if not everyone is getting treatments. There are always room +spa deals going on. 3) The Mix- The Mix is a lounge located at the top of the Hotel that has spectacular views of the strip and a great vibe(though not super crowded like Ghostbar at The Palms).

Stayed at Ceasars, Flamingo, Paris, and MGM. People we traveled with had stayed at a couple of the hotels mentioned before as well as the Bellagio and Monte Carlo. THE Hotel was the hands down nicest hotel any of us had stayed in. Imagine walking into a vegas hotel without dragging your bags through a Casino. Super modern design with an easy to find lobby (not a Casino bottom floor). Mandalay Bay's Casino is just steps away but you cannot even hear the bells from the slots in THE lobby. THE rooms are the biggest I have ever stayed in. 1 and 1/2 bath suites with wonderful styling huge bathroom (with flat screen), comfy beds and lots of mirrors in the room. Only gripe was the rooms were a little dark. Request a high floor and strip view for better views you could get the mountian view which isn't what you came to Vegas for! THE Hotel is connected to Mandalay Bay and you can use the pools thats right pools plural. Theses are the best on the strip. Get out there about 9:00 or 10 AM throw your towels and a spare t-shirt down and head to the Bay Side Buffett breakfast in Mandalay Bay. Tons of food for $12.50. Come back out and you have a chair... everyone does it...dont feel bad. Like any other resort eating by the pool is pricey like $8 - $15 but it is good food!. TIP...there is free water inside the restaurant pool side (just ask where it is) if you dont want to pay $3 for the FIJI. Mix the club on the 64th floor is free to THE Hotel guests (a $25 cover otherwise) There is a quicker back way to the pool so you dont have to go through the Casino. I guess the previous reviewer never asked anyone about it. Everything is Vegas is big and it takes time to walk from place to place...thats what makes Vegas so great. On that note you are WAY down at the end of the strip so here are two tips. 1) Take the monorail that runs between Excaliber, Luxor, and Mandalay Bay. Make sure you get on the one that doesn't stop at Luxor. That will get you to the first big block of MGM, NY-NY etc in 5 minutes. Then you can walk 20 minutes to the next big block of hotels...or you can opt for.... 2) A cab to the Caesars/Paris/Bellagio block is $8.00 +tip and takes 5 minutes.

This was not an issue or a problem with us - just reiterating a point others have made here. We had requested at check in a Strip view and got one on the 35th floor. We couldn't have been happier with the accomodations. Buffets: We tried three; those at Mandalay Bay, Luxor and Excalibur and liked all but Excalibur's. Morea Beach Club: It's $40 for guys and $10 for ladies during the week. Although I wondered whether the price was worth it, we decided to take the plunge and do it one day. We arrived about 8:30am and were let in when they open at 9:00am, were able to put the charge on our room and stayed until about 5:00. There is a level of service that we felt justified the price in part and wished we had made the decision to do this sooner. We ordered lunch and drinks and were waited on wonderfully. Pools in general: The wave pool and South Lagoon pool are a blast. The wave pool generates a nice body surfing wave every 90 seconds or so. The South Lagoon pool is there pool they only have open as an \"overflow\" pool when it gets too busy at the wave pool. As I never more than jumped in and out of the Lazy River pool cannot comment much on that.

Our luggage was all taken care of for us. The room service is yummy and not too badly priced, the catering staff very friendly and prompt. Only warning is don't make any long distance phone calls - crazily expensive!

I was traveling with my wife and seven-year-old son and made the decision primarily based on two reasons: 1.Suites in a newer hotel for less than $200. 2.Access to the Mandalay Bay pools and restaurants. THEhotel entrance is in the garage off Hacienda Ave. Don\u2019t go in the Mandalay Bay Las Vegas Blvd. entrance unless you want to get stuck in a pretty terrifying valet vortex. In addition, be advised that the name of THEhotel can lead to unintended misunderstandings, as in this Abbott-and-Costello-level exchange with the valet: Valet: Are you checking in to the hotel? Me (thinking he meant THEhotel): Yes. Valet (who actually was referring to Mandalay Bay): Pull up right behind that car. I followed his instructions and soon realized I was in the Mandalay Bay line. After some quick work by the valets, I managed to escape and get to the right place. My room (32906) faced McCarran Airport and the Luxor. I could see some of the Strip if I leaned against the window. The suite consisted of a fairly narrow living room and bedroom decorated in shades of brown. To call the lighting in these rooms subdued is an understatement. The living room included a rather uncomfortable couch and chair, a plasma screen TV and a desk. There is a fax and Internet access is available by plugging the supplied Ethernet cable into the appropriate port on your laptop. It\u2019s about $12 for 24 hours of use. I only used it within one 24-hour period but ended up being charged three separate times. The front desk clerk removed the extra charges, but it definitely pays to check your bill before you leave (additionally, we were charged $16 for minibar stuff that the previous guests apparently had used). The bathroom was large, with a deep tub and a granite and glass enclosed shower, and there was a half bathroom in the front hall with a toilet and sink Alas, there was no coffeemaker in the room. Starting at nightfall, sounds of music and conversation drifted into the room and continued till about 2:00 a.m. I never did pinpoint the source, although I suspect it was either the beach or the club atop the hotel. This bothered my wife more than it did me. When she complained about it the next day, the front desk clerk comped our dinner and room service from the previous night and offered to move us. Ultimately, we decided to stay. The music/noise returned on schedule that night, so consider bringing earplugs and a fan for white noise. Getting to the pool involved a long walk past the casino and restaurants. It is an odd sight, seeing families carrying inner tubes and towels past the slots. If you\u2019re heading to the pool through the casino, be sure to go to the left after you pass Red White and Blue restaurant, because going to the right will take you to the convention center (not that I ever made that mistake\u2026) For a shortcut, go out THEhotel entrance and enter the nearby Mandalay Bay valet entrance. This will shorten the walk and help you avoid the casino entirely. We went to the pools late in the afternoon both days and found this to be a wise decision. The crowds have thinned out by then and the towers block the sun so you don\u2019t have to worry about cooking yourself. Stay away from the wave pool unless you like being involved in a game of human pinball. It\u2019s crowded with kids. Definitely try the Lazy River, a meandering loop that provides a mild current to propel you along. Inner tubes are a steep $20 to rent, $16 to buy. I skipped \u2018em and advise you to do the same. There are a couple of serpentine pools that we found to be a pleasant respite from the crowds, although the water in them was almost too warm. We ate at Red White and Blue, the Noodle House, House of Blues, Verandah (in the Four Seasons). On the first night, we walked into Shanghai Lilly\u2019s, which was a lovely spot, only to find it would be a wait without reservations. The next day I called Fleur de Lys to make reservations, but they were closed for dinner because, in the words of the staffer, it wasn\u2019t busy enough to stay open. This was surprising, considering the masses of people everywhere. Housekeeping and service was fine, except for a few indifferent staff members at the pool area. I never once had to wait long for an elevator. Although the hotel\u2019s ads clearly are pitched to the young and hip, the guests I saw represented a wide cross-section of humanity. Saw lots of families, couples, a few seniors. Overall, I\u2019d give THEhotel a solid B. It was fine, but not good enough to keep me from trying someplace else on my next visit to Vegas.", "Date": "July 29, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Louisiana", "Title": "\u201cV ery displeased with TheHotel\u201d", "Author": "Louisianian", "ReviewID": "UR5524126", "Content": "We were \"upgraded\" to TheHotel by the front desk manager at Mandalay Bay because Man.

We are both stressed-out doctors in our late 30's and really needed to be pampered, as this getaway was sans our three daughters. Well, every moment was BLISS. We have been to Las Vegas 4 times previously and none of the other Vegas Strip Hotels can deliver even close to our flawless experience. Check-in was smooth, the front desk upgraded us to a Honeymoon Suite for free, which was on the corner 23rd floor and amazing. It was gigantic, 750. sq. ft, with floor-to-ceiling windows in both the living room and bedroom (two walls of windows in the bedroom). However, I had my heart set on a suite with a view of the Vegas Strip, a request that was immediately honored by ANOTHER FREE UPGRADE to the 36th floor with the most amazing views of the Strip, especially at night. What service with a smile! The suite is huge and chicly dark-hued. The 1 1/2, all marble baths had double vanities, separate seamless shower, a deep soaking tub, and I had the luxury of \"banishing\" my husband to the half bath when we were getting ready. The suite is beyond words and reminds me of a modern version of the St .Regis hotel suite on 5th Ave. and 55th St. in Manhattan. Need I say more? My requests for extra pillows , extra face soap, and a another CD player in the bedroom was granted almost as fast as I hung up the phone. The staff we encountered were friendly and professional, from the Housekeeping people to the Valets and to the Concierge. The beds were comfortable like crazy. We felt we were in a time warp, because between the buffets and the shopping, playing at the craps tables, and the shows (we saw Bellagio's \"O,\" and MGM Grand's \"Ka,\" and Danny Gans at the Mirage --- all excellent), and the restaurants (Le Cirque, Commanders Palace, Shibuya, Craftsteak), the hours and days just flew by, and we always had a hard time getting out of bed becuase of the the feather-tops and high-quality linens. THE hotel shares its pool with the regular Mandalay Bay, and it was quite crowded,as the temperatures were in keeping with the coutry's heatwave (about 114 degrees F). It was a man-made beach and wave pool and it was refreshing. We couldn't get chairs poolside, but that was okay because we only wanted to ool off for an hour. The nay-sayers on Tripadvisor are probably folks who are overly grumpy and hard to please. I'd stay at THE hotel again. Be warned that it is at the most Southern part of the Strip and cabs cost about $10.00 one way to get anywhere you want to go on the Strip, but that's okay because the Monorail is $5.00/pp and it's much more walking. What you get in return is a gorgeos, boutique hotel with excellent service and very minimal cheese-factor. The one thing that I would improve is the entrance, however. The cabbie from the airport dropped us off at the garage-level, which seems so un-grandiose, considering the high caliber of this wonderful hotel. This needs to be improved because the dingy garage drop-off is not fitting of the superior beauty and luxury of the hotel, which smacks you hppily in the face as soon as step foot past the depressing garage-level sliding doors.

We got a great room on the 21st floor on the corner, in a v suite with a super view. Always ask for a room ending in 815 if you want the best views. A higher floor would have been nicer, but were told nothing was available on that corner higher up. Check in by the way was a breeze at 3:00 on a Sunday. Line was non existent, David was pleasent and helpful. I think those people dealing with long check in lines are checking in during some peak times. Not sure what else you would expect. We arrived on Suday in order to avoid the crowds. If I had flown in Friday afternoon or evening, I would have expected a line. Anyway, David said he could give us the room I wanted, above the 20th floor ending in 815, but that housekeeping was currently in it. No worries. We dropped our bags, tipped the maid and grabbed some drinks. Room was immaculate on our return a few hours later. Housekeeping went above and beyond each day we were there (find my trip report in LV forum for more detals). A few bucks goes a long way. It was excellent service. The BathHouse Spa was a pleasure for my wife. She loved every minute of it. She spent HOURS there every day and would probably be happy to have spent her whole vacation there. The lighting IS low. It's a nice ambience, and matches the subtle and dark decor. Bright lighting would ruin that view. The only real complaint I have about the room is that if you are going to have three high end plasma tv's in it, you should A: have a decent selection of stations and B: have a clear picture. I'm not a TV guy so I don't care that much, but I did note that it's a pitiful selection and nothing is High Def. (I watched the All Star game in the room while my wife was napping, would have been nice to see that in HD). I just think that if you spend a gazillion dollars to buid that place you could hook it up decent picture quality. Had room service once, it was excellent, both service and food. Cab stand was friendly and effcient. All staff we encountered was great. Every single one we encountered, even if it was randomly in the hall asked us if we were enjoying our stay.

We like to stay at different properties and thought we would check out The Hotel. We like to stay at upscale proerties and since we stayed at Bellagio last year, we felt we should giveThe Hotel a try. We reserved our rooms 4 months in advance and called to confirm a couple of days prior to check in. When we all arrived we got two different front desk agents.My husband and I got our non smoking king suite on 22nd floor but our friends could only get a smoking room with 2 queens on the 5th floor. They said they were in a sold out situation and could not guarantee the requests for our friends. They did move them the next day, but was a bad way to begin. When we arrived in our room it was lovely. Very large, nice bathroom and TV in bath was a nice touch. We had two lamps not working and when I called down to front desk they had it fixed quickly. Which brings me to my next comments. When staying in this level resort you expect housekeeping to be more attentive to detail. They don't notice 2 lamps not working? We tipped them daily and not once did they replenish our toiletries, she also never left us any hand towels at counter. Only bath towels. I know they have them because we got 1 on our check in day. I know this seems trivial, but we have stayed in many hotels where those little niceties were done daily. Now for the pool. Great pool area with wave pool and lazy river and LOTS of kids. (infants to 20 somethings) so be aware that if you are travelling with kids it will be great, if not you will have to head to South Lagoon pool or private topless pool, or be willing to sit among wall to wall bodies with chairs lined up so closely you have to crawl down to end to get on and off. Oh yeah, pool opens at 8:00 AM and people start lining up at gate at 7:00 AM. Not fun. You can rent a cabana like we did for $300.00 - $400.00 a day (rent a week in advance) and that will afford you some space and get you out of the line but the service at our cabana was to say the least, sketchy. First day at cabana the attendent asked if I knew how to get to my cabana, (I did because we had requested one we saw the night we got in) so I found my way and he told me he would be around at 1:00 PM with bill. He was not kidding, we did not see him again for quite a while. We finally managed to flag down our cocktail server an hour and 1/2 later for ice, towels, cups etc. For those of you not familiar with the cabana scene, those things come std. as do sodas, water, fridge etc. You should have them in your cabana at time of rental or shortly there after. Not an 1 and 1/2 hours later. We stayed all day, got our floats and tubes for lazy river ourselves. ( they bring your floats to you at Bellagio when renting a cabana.) I had one too many Pina Coladas, WAY too much heat and sun and became ill. To the point where they called a medic to check on me. While in cabana with heat stroke and nasuea we used up the water that came in our fridge. When my husband tried to get a couple of more bottles the elusive cabana attendent informed us we would have to be charged for them! Now you have to know that all day we had invited our servers in out of the heat and even offered them a bottle of water. I am not blaming them because it was not there call. It's just unbelievable that when someone is as ill as I was that they would have the audacity to charge us for a couple of bottles water. Next day my friends went down to rent same cabana and got much better service upon arrival. They were shown to their cabana , stocked up with towels and water I might add. Dave was off that day and Dave needs a lesson in customer service. Food was great at all restaurants and service was also good. All in all it was a nice stay, but if I go again, I will go back to Bellagio. The poo lis lovely, but I don't have to line up at 7:00 AM for a chair and I am not touching the chair next to me while sunbathing. The housekeeping is more attentive also and over all service is a step above The Hotel. Oh before I forget, they also don't have security at elevators checking for your key like they do at Bellagio. I find it odd that MGM owns both of these properties and they can be so different.They tout The Hotel as such an upscale property and all. If you are travelling with kids, don't mind waiting in line for an hour at pool then go for it.

Waited in line for about a half hour only to be greeted by a stuffy desk clerk with major attitude. My wife made reservations in her name; he wouldn't let me check in without her being present (we share the same last name). This meant I'd need to again wait in line for another half hour after locating her. Finally convinced the clerk to take care of the matter with a phone call. Fortunately, my wife answered the phone and confirmed I had permission to check in. The lobby and elevator foyer were breathtaking. Very sublime and modern. Really liked the floors, woodwork, high ceilings, furniture, and light sconces. Were expecting great things when we arrived at our room. Apparently the desk clerk's intellect isn't as big as his attitude because he had assigned us disabled accommodations next to a utility room reserved for housekeeping (very noisy during the morning and into the afternoon). We aren't disabled. This meant that instead of a marble encased tub and shower, we received fiberglass enclosures with cheap shower wands. Since everything is lower in this type of room (including light switches), the shower curtain on both the shower side and the tub side were ill-fitting, dragging about two feet on the floor! Very ugly, to say the least. Outside of that, the suite was nice, the bed was comfy, and the air conditioning worked well. A full one bedroom with separate living/desk area. Furnishings are hip and appeared to be of some quality. Flat screens were a nice touch. View outside was nothing . . . parking garage and street running through the property. Another \"thanks\" to the desk clerk with major attitude. Didn't use any amenities like the pool. The casino is nice, room service was fast, professional, and efficient. The restaurant located between The Hotel and the casino floor was good and the people were very nice. Think we'll check out other upscale suites the next time we're in Vegas.

We had a wonderful, relaxing stay at THE Hotel. We arrived at 10pm on Thursday and had no wait to check in, with a very pleasant middle aged, knowledgeable member of staff waiting to assist us. Our requests at check-in were accommodated, with no hassle and no unpleasantries. Check out on Sunday at 11am presented a long line, but sufficient staff at the reception desk, consuming a total of 20 minutes of our time. They were quick and efficient. Room 12909 was very clean. Maid service was excellent and tipped accordingly. In fact, all service personnel were excellent and responsive to requests. For those kings and queens out there who deserve royal treatment, who complain about bad service, a piece of advice - tipping service staff DOES make a difference to the quality of service you receive. They are not YOUR servants, they are people doing a job. These people bust their butts daily, with few who recognize their efforts and many who leave their rooms trashed. A minimal tip and a simple thank you goes a long way. Room service was quick - food well proportioned, hot, and delicious. (We were comped on our bill when charged to our room, which made it even better). Although there are many complaints about the dim lighting in the suites, we found it very relaxing. With 2 bedside lamps, one pedastal lamp, and overhead canned lighting along the floor to ceiling, wall to wall window of natural light, it's as bright or as dark as you opt for it to be. The black-out curtains allowed for much-needed sleep well into the daylight hours, to compensate for the late nights, which we very much appreciated. We frequent Vegas at least yearly and always stay somewhere new. Up until our stay at THE Hotel, Bellagio was our #1 pick. However, after staying at THE Hotel, we feel cheated for having spent the money at other \"high end\" properties, as no room we have ever stayed in compares to that of the suite we occupied at THE Hotel. It was very comfortable, contemporary, and the rich earth tone colors provided a relaxed ambiance beyond compare. Other rooms we have stayed in were simply a place to sleep. Our suite at THE Hotel was a place we looked forward to getting back to, to relax and reconnect. When leaving our room to relax at the pool, we turned our housekeeping light on and upon each return, our suite was immaculately cleaned and toiletries replenished in abundance. Again, minimal tipping makes a huge difference with service staff. My husband and I are in our mid-30's and felt to be the mainstream at THE Hotel, as far as age is concerned. There was the usual fair share of 40 something's trying to keep up with the 20 something's - lots of plastic and collagen - so very LA. People watching is one of the free entertainment aspects we much enjoy and find great humor in, especially in Vegas. Although a short walk to the casino in Mandalay Bay, the pools were quite the hike. With the size of this resort being considered, the walking distance should be expected. We opted for the South Lagoon Pool, which we had no problem staking claim on lounge chairs directly poolside. This pool is the farthest walking distance with steps leading up to it, which we found to be kid-free and more of an adult crowd, which was our preference. Cocktail waitresses were very attentive and drinks contained a generous portion of alcohol, so the 12 dollars per drink became a non-issue quick. If you walk through the convention center all the way to the end exit, you don't have to do the stairs and it is a more direct path to take. After cocktails at the pool all afternoon, the quickest path to A/C was our preferred path. The Bayside Buffet breakfast was okay, usual buffet options. House of Blues breakfast was better and lunch was excellent too (burgers and boneless wings were out of this world awesome - although after many cocktails may have been the alcohol ;) Zumanity was comedic, moreso than I expected. Erotic, sexual, and funny. Definitely a different edge and would not recommend for virgin Cirque viewers. This is NOT typical Cirque. If you are not an open minded, passionate lover, do not see this production, as it will likely leave you feeling violated. For those of you, like my husband and myself, you won't be able to get back to your room quick enough. I was a little disappointed in the Zumanity gift shop, however. After leaving the show, I was hoping for some fun toys in the shop to take back to our room. Mamma Mia was AWESOME! Tickets were inexpensive and this was THE best musical production I have ever seen. Being an 80's child, big fan of ABBA, could see this one again and again. Highly recommend. All in all, can't wait to return. For the first time ever, will not visit somewhere new, but definitely plan to return to THE Hotel.

When I inquired about stairs, I was told they are only used for emergencies and fire hazards - ummmm.....whatever. Like 20 people crammed in an elevator is any safer than a family of four willingly walking up stairs? 3) Room rates are too high - not enough bang for your buck. My brother stayed in a suite and I didn't think it was even all that roomy. 4) Since it is located at the end of the strip, there aren't many affordable options for eating close by.

Lots of choices, seafood, chinese dishes, lamb, veal cutlet, prime rib, sushi.... all were very good. The pools and beach were wonderful! Yes, it was crowded at the wave pool and the lazy river.

If you plan to visit here save some money and bring a tube from home.

The first was in November of 2005 prior to my deployment to the Mideast- this time was during my mid-tour leave, which happened to coincide with my anniversary. I called a few weeks beforehand to order champagne and strawberries to be ready upon check-in. We'll get to that in a minute. We showed up around 3 PM and were told, as expected, that our room wasn't ready. I mentioned that we'd probably hit up the gym as both my wife and I were eager to work out some tension after a long flight. The woman at the front desk was happy to comp us use of the gym and spa facilities for the entire week! We grabbed what we needed out of our suitcases, sent them away with the bellhop, and enjoyed the gym and bathhouse for a few hours. Our room was ready around 5:30 so we went upstairs, only to find out that our key didn't work. I went back downstairs and the problem was remedied. Luckily, I have an extreme amount of patience, so I wasn't really bothered by the minor inconvenience. Upon entering the room, the champagne and strawberries were absent, so I flagged down a room service attendant in the hallway and he promptly took care of it. The rest of the week went pretty well. We ordered plenty of room service (the portions are extremely generous and the quality was surprisingly good). We spent a day at the pool but, being from Florida, it wasn't a huge draw for us. The restaurants inside the Mandalay complex were great. We ate at The Burger Bar (which I was happy to see served Pyramid Hefeweizen on tap- the only such place I found it), Wolfgang Puck's Lupo (delicious), and China Grill (huge portions!).

Let me start off by saying that before we went, I read all of the reviews on this site and some of the negative reviews concerned me. We even considered changing our reservations. We went and had a wonderful time and we had NO PROBLEMS whatsoever. Everyone we encountered - the maids, the bellhops, the front desk staff \u2013 were courteous and helpful. We arrived at about 11:30 PM for check in. Check-in was fast and the registration desk attendant was very friendly and courteous. We were upgraded to a corner \u201cV\u201d suite free of charge. The room was clean and we loved the decor. The bed was incredibly comfortable and I slept like a baby! The bath products are wonderful and I took advantage of the large soaking tub every day. The only complaint we had was that when we entered the room, it took us a few minutes to figure out how to work the lights. Like many others, we requested a late checkout, but we were unable to get one due to the AFL Superbowl which was held over the weekend \u2013 we were told that they were 102% booked. We use the bellhop service and had no problems with our luggage. Maid service came around 10 AM on the first day (Tuesday) and then between 3-4 PM the rest of the week. Not a problem for us, we just planned around it. I don\u2019t think they are intentionally being slow \u2013 I noticed that the maid\u2019s cart was out in the hallway all day \u2013 they started cleaning early in the morning and did not finish until around 5 PM. The rooms are large and they take a while to clean. We know this because one afternoon we were in our room when they came by to clean. The maid was in our room for no less than 30 minutes. After reading some of the problems folks had finding chairs at the pool, we decided to go down to the pool every morning and get chairs, stay there until lunchtime and then go about our day (thus avoiding the crowd and the hottest part of the day). The pool was practically empty Tues & Wed. We had trouble finding chairs on Thurs. because we slept in and didn\u2019t get out to the pool until 10AM. Friday morning we got out there around 9AM and got a seat in the front row by the wave pool. It did get very crowded on Friday and there was a lot of partying going on in the shallow section of the wave pool. We saw a lot of people \u201csaving chairs\u201d with towels, but it didn\u2019t seem to slow most people down. I saw a lot of people removing the towels and having a seat. It does seem like they need to expand the pool area. One other concern was that on the busy days, the wave pool did get littered with a lot of trash \u2013 its disappointing that there was no staff around to clean things up. I decided to get a 50 min. massage at the Spa at Mandalay Bay because I thought that I would like the atmosphere better than the Bathhouse. While this was not the best spa I\u2019ve been to, it was very good. I would give it 4 out of 5 stars, and I\u2019m only knocking it down one star because the trashcan was overflowing in the restroom and the shower attendants did not remove some of the used washcloths and towels from the floor of the shower. Mandalay Bay is at the very south end of the strip, but I liked the fact that we were somewhat secluded from the crowds of tourists that we encountered roaming through NYNY, the MGM, and the Wynn. The tram and the monorail make it pretty easy to get around, and when all else fails, grab a taxi! You also notice a difference walking through the hallway that takes you back to THE hotel (feels like you are walking away from the madness). The entrance to THE hotel may be unimpressive (as it is inside a parking garage) but I think the isolation back there is a plus. People have complained on this site about the d\u00e9cor and atmosphere of THE hotel and have said that it is geared towards a certain age group and the \u201cparty crowd.\u201d My husband and I are both professionals in our early 30\u2019s. While there were a lot of younger partiers on Friday and Saturday, we weren\u2019t bothered by any of them. All I can say is do your research and if you know you won\u2019t be comfortable in a hotel with a certain d\u00e9cor that gears to a certain crowd \u2013 don\u2019t stay there!! The options for places to stay in Vegas are endless. People have also complained that drinks, food, services, etc. are expensive. I\u2019m sorry, but the days of the $4.00 buffet are long gone in Vegas. Everything is expensive on the strip \u2013 some hotels more than others \u2013 just plan for it and get over it! We would absolutely stay at THE Hotel again in the future \u2013 maybe not next trip because I really want to stay at the Bellagio or maybe the Wynn \u2013 but we will be back! Bars & Restaurants: Mix \u2013 We went up to Mix (the bar/restaurant on the top floor of THE hotel) on Wed. night. General admission is $20 but is free to guests of THE hotel (just show your room key). The drinks were $12+ each, but the view is WELL worth it. The bar is approx. 400 feet above the strip so you have a bird\u2019s eye view of all of the hotels on the strip. It was just amazing up there. There was a lightning storm while we were there which was even more wild. If you go, make sure to use the restroom while you\u2019re in there \u2013 the wall of the bathroom is glass from floor to ceiling \u2013 just WILD! THE Caf\u00e9 \u2013 We ate breakfast in the caf\u00e9 one morning. The food was very good. Service was a little slow (but the restaurant was almost full). R&M Seafood (Mandalay Place) \u2013 We ate dinner here Tues. night. The service was OK. I had a good plate of Mahi Mahi, but my husband\u2019s Ahi tuna was not very fresh. I would skip this one and try one of the other amazing seafood restaurants in Vegas. Elements in the Aladdin is still my favorite for fusion seafood. Aureole \u2013 This is the famous restaurant with the 5 story wine tower and the wine angels. There are two menu choices \u2013 the first is a \u201ctasting\u201d which is $95/person. They bring you 9 small plates of various dishes and it takes about 2 hours to complete. The second is a choice from a list of first courses, main entrees and desserts for $75/person. We chose the later option. My husband had very good Ahi tuna (1st) and a Filet (main). My meal was just OK. I had a hard time selecting because I\u2019m semi-vegetarian so I had the Gnocchi (1st) and the John Dory (main). The John Dory was good, but was served on an odd combination of saut\u00e9ed avocados and mushrooms which I didn\u2019t care for. Dessert was the best course in my opinion. The wine list is very cool \u2013 they bring it to you on a handheld computer. Service was very good. Our final bill was around $250 (incl. a bottle of wine and tip.) I don\u2019t think we will eat there again \u2013 too many good restaurants to chose from in Vegas and this one was just OK compared to other restaurants we\u2019ve sampled in Vegas. Red White & Blue \u2013 We went there for breakfast one morning. The food was pretty overpriced for what you get (i.e., $4.95 for a bagel) and the service was pretty slow. They had a lot of waitresses/waiters and bus boys just standing around goofing off. The Bayside Buffet \u2013 This was my husband\u2019s 3rd time in Vegas (my 6th) and he had never been to a buffet, so we decided to give this one a shot. I have been to the Luxor and Bellagio buffets and both were nicer than this one (with the Bellagio being the best). This buffet is definitely for people looking for quantity over quality. It had some of the nicer items \u2013 crab legs, shrimp, sushi \u2013 but I sampled all and none were very fresh. I had three different plates of food \u2013 and each item I maybe took one bite and left the rest. The desserts were better \u2013 they had both a chocolate and white chocolate fountain with very fresh strawberries which was nice. Shows: KA: We have seen Drallion, Mystere and O, but this one was my husband\u2019s favorite. The story line in KA is much easier to follow and as always, the costumes and set were absolutely amazing. Compared to the other resident Cirque shows in Vegas, KA is more dark and serious with a lot less comic relief. I enjoyed KA \u2013 there were many moments where I was sitting there thinking \u201chow are they doing that?!\u201d, but O is still my favorite Cirque show. Zumanity: After seeing KA and loving it on the second night of our trip, we decided at the last minute to see if there were tickets available for Zumanity on our last night in Vegas. We went to the box office Fri. afternoon and were able to get two tickets in the balcony in the front row. The show was very entertaining \u2013 the clowns were hysterical \u2013 the acts were very exciting. It is an \u201cadult\u201d show and they hit on some very erotic themes, but it was all very artistically and tastefully done. We loved it with one exception.

We travel quite a bit and have stayed in a number of hotels throughout world. This hotel was quite nice. The rooms are a good size and having them seperated into a living area and sleeping area is nice if you are traveling with children. The half bath in the living area was a nice bonus as well. The lobby is very modern and elegant and the elevators are fast. Room service had good food, fast service and a decent price. I only have 2 main issues with the hotel. The first one is with housekeeping. Housekeeping never seemed to make it to our room until around 4pm. The problem with this was that it was usually the time in which we were coming back from the pool to take showers and get ready for the evening. One night we just let them clean up around us. The last night we were there we just asked for fresh towels and sent them on their way. We had a room right next to the housekeeping (room) station and did not understand why they would show up right when they saw us coming in from the pool every day. Also, they were quite loud in the housekeeping room, starting fairly early in the morning. One day they mopped (or polished) the floors and had loud fans running ALL day into the early evening. There was also quite a bit of dust in our room everyday. My second issue was having to walk through the casino to get to the pool area. I do not understand way they did not set up a more direct route to the pool area from The Hotel. It made it uncomfortable to walk through the casino in a wet swimsuit and coverup. Not to mention the kids hated walking through the casino because of the smoke smell. Other then those two complaints I thought the hotel was very nice. The pool are was great but the water was freezing cold. My children did not seem to mind but I couldn't even get in it was so cold. The lazy river was fun as was the wave pool and we never had a problem finding lounge chairs. I would recommend this hotel. Shopping and food choices are not as good as the Venetian but it does have nice rooms.

Negative: a) First night of three hotel could not give us the bedding we requested (KING) so we had to settle for a double. Quite underwhelming since we had booked, and they had charged 1st night's charge all the way back to early Oct, 2005. If date of booking meant anything at all, our 9-month old booking should have preceeded most of the occupants for this particular evening. Since our check-in was around 7PM, relatively early, I felt clearly the hotel simply did not want to honor our reservation bed-type preference, made 9 months earlier. For the 2nd night they allowed a room change to requested KING bed. Too little, too late. Got no better room (ie upgrade) than what we had pre-paid for and reserved anyway, so there was no attempt to make it right after initial foul-up b) though we tend to handle our own luggage, there was not a bellboy in sight, from the time we got out of the cab, to the time we headed to the elevator after check-in. Surreal for a property of this size and reputation. c) we felt overall attitude of the front desk CSR(s)l was \"take it or leave it, we don't want to be bothered\". More than any other complaint, this arrogant attitude is why we would not repeat here. d) one other poster mentions this, and I have to agree that the room interior lighting is extremely poor. If you want to read late evening, good luck. A lady on the elevator was complaining about this very issue as well and commented she could not put on her makeup correctly due to the poor lighting. e) though it didn't affect us, our friends had a spa appointment at 10AM on the date of their checkout. Normal check-out is 11AM for this property. Once again, front desk could care less our friends were spending $250+ at their spa to allow for a late checkout and denied their request outright, so our friends had to finish their spa treatment and essentially hustle up to their room to check out. f) Could not get apple powerbook on their wireless service no matter what I tried, nor could friends of ours. Both of us are competent w/ the apple os to know workarounds to most problems, but we both gave up on the wireless access and were able to get online via the in-room cablemodel provided drop. The pool complex was the single reason we chose this location over much better rates, incl next door at MB. Next time we'll choose Mandalay Bay or skip the entire brand and go back to the strip groupings (Bellagio, Venetian). \"The Hotel\" was \"The Pits\" for us.

We arrived a little earlier (1:45) than the 3:00 pm check-in time, but knew we'd most likely have to wait for our room and assumed that this \"luxury\" Hotel would store our bags until our room was ready. After waiting in line at the front desk for approx. 30 minutes, we were told that the hotel was overbooked and that they would offer us a suite at the Resort next door for $50 less than our nightly rate. I explained to them that we had both spa and dinner reservations at the Hotel and that we'd spent quite a bit of money for fight tickets and that we weren't apt to move, especially since we were there early with a guaranteed reservation. Having worked at a hotel, I know that due to the overbook situation, they were trying to get any takers to move to the Resort and assumed that since we are on the younger side (30ish) we wouldn't know any better and take the suite. I should also mention I'm not one of those difficult, crabby travelers who yell at innocent front-desk receptionists. After I politely told the man that I understood they were overbooked but that we would not accept the suite and they would have to move someone else, he rolled his eyes and said \"fine\". He went on to say he couldn't check us into the system until 3:00 or after and that he could not arrange to hold our bags for us since we technically weren't guests yet. Told us to check with the bellhop at the front regarding bag storage. Not exactly what I call luxury hotel service. We finally did get a room around 4:30. It was close to the noisy elevator, with no view and poorly cleaned. Lightbulb was out by the only lamp in the sitting area. The Hotel is \"cool\" and everyone walking around the lobby seems to think they are equally as cool. Service the rest of the weekend was okay. Spa was decent, but again, service was only average.

Unless we find an excellent rate for it, I doubt that we will return to stay there again. This is mainly due to it\u2019s out of the way location on the far south-end of the Strip and the way the hotel's staff handled our luggage after we checked out (and paid) \u2013 more on that in a bit. The suite itself was pretty nice. The bathroom was spacious and the best thing about the suite. It had its own TV and a separate bath tub and shower. The suite had a small sitting area with a sofa, chair, and desk. Unlike the Venetian which has open floor plans, the bedroom and living room were separated by walls. It made each room seem somewhat cramped (although I guess you could call it cozy :)). While the suite came with three nice televisions, unfortunately, the reception in our suite was poor especially compared to the quality of the TV\u2019s in the Sports Book at Mandalay Bay. Also on a negative note, we didn\u2019t care for the type of sheets that the hotel used and the lighting in the bedroom and living room area was extremely poor in our opinion. The housekeeping was good, but somewhat inconsistent. One day our rug for the shower was not replaced and on another day we only received one hand towel \u2013 minor annoyances but we expected better. If I was just judging on the room, I would give the hotel 3 stars. What really compelled me to write this review was the way THEHotel handled our luggage after we checked out. Our flight did not leave until 7 PM on the day we checked out. I called down to the front desk and inquired about a late check out. The clerk indicated that they were not offering late checkouts but we were more than welcomed to check our luggage with the bellhops. That sounded reasonable. So we checked our luggage with the hotel at around 11:15 AM. Assuming that our luggage was in good hands, we enjoyed our final day in Vegas dining, playing some blackjack at the MGM Grand, shopping, and betting on the horses at Mandalay Bay. We finally arrived back to THEHotel around 4:45 PM to get our luggage and head to the airport. To our surprise, we found that our luggage and a number of other guests\u2019 luggage were setting out behind the taxi stand and not in the baggage room. It was extremely hot on that date (June 2, 2006) reaching 104 F, and we had medicine and makeup in our bags that shouldn\u2019t be in that temperature. So our baggage was in the heat and it didn\u2019t seem particularly secured. After asking the bellhop why our luggage was out in the heat, I eventually spoke to the manager. He indicated that THEHotel had insufficient space for bag storage and that this was the best they could do. At one point he opened the door to show us his lack of space to discover in fact that there were plenty of empty shelves on which to store luggage. If I wasn\u2019t upset, I would have laughed because it was pretty funny when he opened the door. We were finally given cash to cover damages to our medicine and my wife\u2019s make-up. But it was a horrible way to have to leave Vegas after having to hassle with all of this. We both encouraged the manager to have his employees warn customers in the future that their luggage might be stored out in the open exposed to the temperature. I also wondered why the luggage was not moved into the luggage room as space became available. It seems like poor planning and/or training to me but maybe my expectations are too high. For a hotel that seems to pride it's self for being a swanky boutique hotel within all of the hustle of Vegas, I would have expected better guidelines for the handling of customer's luggage during a day that reached 104 degrees (F). The way they handled our luggage made us feel disrespected, especially considering how much we spent for the room. If you are looking for a suite, book the Venetian.

There was quite a long line of people waiting to check in, but that was to be expected, and the 5 or so agents were moving quickly. Our check in was very smooth - they had the reservation, gave us our room (at 2..) and all was well. Frankly, we were prepared for them to tell us our room wouldn't be ready until 3 or 4, so we were pleasantly surprised. The rooms are absolutely wonderful! Definitely the highlight of the trip. They are well appointed, comfortable colors and beds, and definitely high end. We loved having the extra bathroom near the entry door, and thoroughly enjoyed the main bathtub and all of the wonderful toiletries. Maid service was prompt and thorough. We tipped the maid and she would leave extra toiletries in the room. TheHotel is very close to the casino, but very far from all of the restaurants and the pool at the Mandalay Bay. We ate at Rum Jungle one night. The food was good (not great)service was excellent and the drinks were outstanding. We also ate at the Border Grill - food, service and drinks were all excellent. We ended up getting muffins and fruit from the Starbucks in the casino area for breakfast, so I can't comment on the breakfast buffets. Our only complaint with this hotel was the pool, and this is the only reason that I rated TheHotel a 4 instead of a 5. Now, being Memorial Day weekend, we did expect it to be crowded. We went out at 10:00 a.m. on Sunday, and every chair around every pool was taken. It wasn't like people had thrown their towels on chairs and walked away - the people were in their chairs. A lady that we talked to said people were lined up at 8:00 and literally ran to their chairs as soon as the pool opened. My husband and I walked around for over 30 minutes trying to find a chair, but to no avail. We decided to grab a margarita from the outside restaurant, until we saw the prices. $12 for a margarita that comes out of one of those mixing machines. What a joke! We finally gave up and walked away, had lunch at the Border Grill and went shopping. When you are paying $300+ a night for a room, you should at least be able to enjoy the amenities of the hotel. The sad part was when we left the pool area around 11, there was a very long line of people waiting to get in. We just shook our heads in disgust. Like everyone else stated, the hotel is pretty far away from everything else. Yes, you can take trams and monorails and taxis, but if the ladies are wearing any type of shoe other than gym shoes, walking really isn't a good thing. My feet were destroyed by the end of the weekend. I think if we ever do get back to Las Vegas, we will stay towards the center of the strip - either Caesars, Paris or the Venetian.

Housekeeping was descent, although one day our room wasn't cleaned until 4pm. Location: The Hotel is located in a separate Tower from Mandalay Bay. It's located way too far from the pool area of Mandalay Bay. With children, this is their downfall. The Hotel needs a private pool located within walking distance, not so far where you need a taxi just to get there. This is the only reason why I would not stay here again. It was very difficult to first find the pool complex from our hotel, then to have to walk all the way back through the casino in our beach attire, with children, tired and wet.

It has a quite, classic elegance that is hard to find in Las Vegas. I've been partaking in an annual girls trip for four years. The Hotel at the Mandalay Bay is perfect for our trip. The rooms are large enough for 3 or 4 girls to share. The idea of two bathrooms per room is unheard of in most \"rack\" rooms. Three flat panel televisions, a refridgerator, the most comfortable beds ever, a huge tub, two sinks in the master bath, a separate water closet, lighted make-up mirror what more can you want? My only complaint is in regards to the lighting, it\u2019s not bright enough in the bathroom, but you get used to it. The Mandalay Bay complex has something for everyone. The adjoining Luxor complex adds considerably to that mix. Yes, the pool is extremely crowded, yes the hordes of men and women can sometimes create an unsuitable environment for children. If you are traveling with children, perhaps the very little known Lagoon Pool, which is completely separate from the rest of the pool complex would be a better choice. The maid service arrives daily, usually when you are ready to take a nap, but they always offer to provide clean towels, etc. I would recommend the Spa at the Manadalay Bay over the Bathhouse Spa at the Hotel. The MB spa is larger and somewhat more feminine. The Bathhouse spa is sparse. The massage is expensive and both my friend and I were short changed by 5 minutes, which given the cost of the massage was annoying. I love this hotel. I love that there is no casino in this hotel, it is connected to the Mandalay Casino. I love the layout of the room. Every room is a two room suite.

I had called the week before to reconfirm everything and it was fine, so I did not bring any printed confirmation.

They said they wanted to transfer their extra hotel room to us so we would have a room and they said it didn't work that way.

We were in town from May 14th - May17th for a convention and thought it would be a nice vacation. The photographs on the website are very accurate so what you see is what you get. The positives: 1. Room was very beautiful and spacious. Not our usual taste in decor but very nice all the same. 2. Having three televisions is very nice when traveling with children. The selection of channels are great. Have stayed in most of the hotels in vegas for over 15 years but have noticed that most tv channel selections are diminishing. There is also a dvd player for the plasma which we did not utilize. 3. The beds are comfortable. 4. Check in: we personally did not have any problems with check in or the staff. Our room was available even though we checked in about one hour earlier. I called the front desk to extend our check out time and did not encounter any problems, was accommodated with my request. 5. Swimming: we went to the pool around 3:00pm, had no problen finding a chair. The negatives: 1. The furniture in the room is not child-friendly. If you are traveling with very young children be cautious of the sharp corners on most of the furniture. There is plenty of glass and mirrors in the room. If your children are very active, you'll be worrying about their safety. 2. Housekeeping is very poor. You would expect by the high price you pay per night, housekeeping would be excellent, WRONG!! When housekeeping cleaned our room, they did the bare minimum. The did not clean the bathtub or vacuum the room. After seeing the room you'll notice that there is a lot of furniture to clean and dust but there is no excuse in not doing your job. This is a major no no in my book!! Not that it's a major offensive, but there was old gum in the carpet which no one had tried to get out. This attests to the getover mentality of some of the housekeeping!! 3. There were no robes in our room...not that I would use them but I certainly don't want to get a bill for something which was never there! 4. Swimming: there are many families who utilize the pool but a very raunchy, profane crowd tends to migrate to the lazy river pool. The life guards need to be more agressive when they see some drunk idiots spoiling the lazy river. Overall, the stay was ok.

If you want an excellent buffet take the tram that connects Mandalay Bay, Luxor and Excalibur and go to the Excalibur's Buffet. It was excellent. I only had two things that bothered me. There is no security keeping people off the elevators at THE Hotel. Anyone can go up there. I guess it is because you need to use them for the Mix. But after the restaurant closes they should have someone that keeps trespassers out. Also the House of Blues. Because of it's location right in the casino it would get very crowded in the evenings. Huge crowds milling around outside even when they could not get in. Not doing anything but drinking and waiting for the show to be over. Hanging all over the slot machines but not playing them. One night there was a young woman that couldn't even stand and she kept falling to the floor and people would just step over her. They need to have some type of crowd control.

After reading several reviews, we went with an \"open mind\", hoped for the best and booked here. Here goes: The short - poor customer service skills of front desk staff leave a nasty taste/bad first impression.....no one seems to be able to check into the rooms they booked/paid for upon check-in and are given the same \"scripted\" please check back later speech. Managers aren't much better. Maid service is hit or miss, but bellmen and housekeeping are very responsive when you call to make a request for something.

Will get far better service and check-in satisfaction at \"old faithfuls\" and newcomers like: Caesar's, Bellagio, Bally's/Paris, Wynn, Hard Rock etc... The Detailed version: 1) Arrived @ 12:30am on Wed Night/Thurs morning after flying for a total of 9 and 1/2 hours only to be told our room (King Suite) wasn't available. Only one other couple was being assisted by ONE OF TWO desk agents. The second agent made us wait (we timed it) for almost 5 minutes while he typed who knows what into the computer. When he decided to deal with us, we were told that our room wasn't available and that we'd have to stay in a Double bed suite. For the inconvience, he said he was going to upgrade us to a VIP suite on a higher floor with strip view. He instructed us not to get unpacked, assured us that the VIP suite was blocked so it wouldn't be unavailable later and to come back at 12 noon to be moved. As we were leaving we heard the other agent tell other guests the same thing and made the same \"upgrade\" promise. We returned at 1pm (decided to wait a little since check out is supposed to be at 11am) to inquire about our new room. This time - several agents and a long line of guests waiting to be checked in. We \"lucked up\" and got one of the most smug and condescending agents on staff. He acted as if we should be honored and priviledged to have a room at all. Instead of taking the time to read what was on the screen and listen to my explanation, he cut me off and inquired why we kept switching rooms. I explained that it wasn't by choice, but a result of the room we paid for not being available upon our check-in. Without apologizing, he stated \"well, I do see the room that you are supposed to be moved to but it shows that housekeeping is there. I can't tell you how long they'll be so you're going to have to keep your room and try again later.\" Wrong answer! We explained that we were tired and wanted to get settled and be able to move on w/ the second leg of our vacation. When I asked for a manager, he instead offered to call the room and tell the housekeeper to expedite clean up and would call our room to let us know when the new room would be ready. 20 min later, we receive a call from him telling us to come down, skip the line and wait to speak w/ him and bring our luggage since he was switching us as we spoke. When we got to the \"upgraded\" room, it was filthy. The maid had begun to pull the sheets but nothing was changed or cleaned. Back to the desk again. This time different agent.....thankfully, this one was helpful and somewhat apologetic. She yes'd me to death in a tone that said \"ok got it, now shut the f#$k up\", informed me that we hadn't been upgraded as promised but sent to a regular King Bed suite that had a view of the strip...and offered to upgrade us to a VIP suite w/ a pool& garage view on a lower floor. When I asked about having a VIP Suite with a strip view, the response was (surprise) sorry but nothing's available. 2) Housekeeping - didn't come until very late afternoon early evening. Bed wasn't completely made, one of the complimentary bathrobes had a hole in the side and the belt loops were completely broken off.....did the bare basic cleaning (i.e., made bed, replaced towels and washcloths) but didn't organize things likes shoes and items on nightstand or coffee table at all. No biggie, there are worse offenses. 3) Pool - forget going. I've stayed at several other strip hotels with large/multiple pools and all provide more than enough (in some cases too many) chairs for guests. We were shocked that NO CHAIRS were available by 9:45am! It was insane. When we asked about the possibility of staff brining more the answer was \"nope, what you see is what you get, sorry\". 4) Shark Reef channel - a joke...the picture tended to be barely viewable...one minute it was extremely dark...majority of the time, too fuzzy and distorted to really appreciate. The Positives: A) The Bed - it was very hard for us to get up and get moving...the bed and linens were addictive....anytime we laid down we had to struggle to get back up. B) VIP Suite - the bedroom especially was wonderful! Very cozy, yet elegant and relaxing.....really loved the layout. C) Bell Staff - very attentive and helpful. Also Housekeeping arrived promptly after calling down for new bathrobe and laundry bags w/ price list. Summary - much better places for the same ball park price (or less) that are far more worth the money and stay. The front desk staff (mangers included) definitely need an attitude adjustment.

The Good: Beautiful Rooms that are large, tastefully done with many amenities, lovely modern lobby, fantastic pools at the nearby Mandalay Bay Hotel and a casino that is nicer than most. The Bad: Pools are located away from the hotel, so guests have to walk through the Mandalay Bay casino in their pool clothing to get to the pool area. Not very far, but can seen that way after walking all day. The lazy river is really short and not that lazy, seemed to be full of kids and ran at a pretty fast pace the day we were there. Floats are too big for the river and cost $20 to rent. Take a look at the river before you decide to rent. TIP: you can buy a float at the small place that you rent floats from for only $15 (it's smaller, but just the right size). We bought one, but just threw it to the size, because it was easier to just body surf around. Also floats are not allowed in any of the other pools (including the wave pool), they will make you get out. The Ugly: Terrible Customer Service. They got everything wrong from the start. ignored all of our requests for specific types of rooms, i.e. king bed/no smoking (did'nt even acknowledge these requests). Gave us keys for rooms that when opened were still occupied, Twice this happened. Fed up, I called down on the hall phone and asked for a manager. They gave me just a supervisor, who said no other rooms were available (GIVE ME A BREAK, all casino's hold extra rooms for VIP's). After talking to another supervisor or front desk person for all I know, I was again told that no rooms were available. At this point I was really angry. I toted all my luggage down to the lobby and demanded to speak with a real manager, not just a supervisor. 15 minutes later I was in a VIP Suite with a great view of the strip. But, should guests really have to spend two hours checking in and practically beg for the room they reservered two months in advance? It took hours for me to calm down and get in a better mood.

On the negative side, it was very noisy in the hallway during the day, mostly staff maids, room service carts, etc., hard to take a nap. The Hotel is very dark. The A/C was kind of hoisy, I turned off the one in the bedroom and just used the other one. The pool should have a non-smoking section. There is hardly any room between the lounge chairs and there were a lot of people smoking.

They are quiet and loaded with amenities from 3 flat screen TV's in 2 separate rooms with 2 separate water closets to a doorbell for housekeeping to a beautifully oversized bathroom to a wonderfully comfortable bed. The bathtub was enormous and filled via a waterfall effect nozzle on the side. The rooms truly are suites and they're lovely. And that is all the good I have to say about THEhotel at Mandalay Bay. It started badly when I pulled up to the valet service, had to unload my bags myself (I'm not a big girl and I arrived solo), schlep them into the hotel myself (is there a bell desk anywhere at this hotel??), and had to ask a custodial worker (!?) where the heck the lobby was/is. No one had pointed me in any direction from the valet \"service\" and the signage is practically non-existent in the lobby area, which is keeping with the austere aura of THEhotel but not helpful to guests trying to get somewhere. After being directed to go past the \"Coffee Bar\" sign (go figure), I found the front desk or more accurately, I found the line for the front desk. I was treated to standing in the most ridiculous cattle call of a check-in line anywhere, anytime. The person behind me in our 25 minute check-in line (no joke and this was @ 9:45 p.m. last Thursday night) became enraged and collared every hotel worker she could find until she got her grips on the hotel manager. The hotel manager, in the lobby, in front of a line-up of us weary new arrivals actually said, \"Yes, we're understaffed.\" And it even gets better... The hotel manager then disappeared (!) behind a wall at the rear of the barren front desk, not even attempting to help alleviate the check-in line personally. Other highlights include: 1. Whenever we called anywhere within the hotel, the average rings to pick up were 11. We truly counted because it was so mind boggling and, sadly, became a source of twisted amusement for us. 2. One of our room card keys became de-magnetized and needed to be replaced. The person assisting us casually asked how we were enjoying our stay. Our response was a genuine, \"Not much so far\" to which the worker responded with a shrug. A SHRUG? Either the employee had received z e r o training in customer service or had heard that response so many times before her shrug was a nervous reflex response. 3. There is no evening turndown service. There were never enough towels left with the once-daily regular housekeeping service. 4. Three (3) people working at the in-house Starbucks on Sunday morning. Six times (6x) that many people in line. 5. On the last night of our stay, we got back to our room only to find that there were no pillowcases at all on our pillows when we turned down our bed. After calling housekeeping, someone showed up with a couple of pillowcases but did not offer to put the pillowcases on the pillows (which, of course, we would've declined but not to offer?), much less did they not even offer an apology. They handed the pillowcases over to us and fled without a word. Finally, we left using the Express Check-out (little box by the elevators) because catching a look at the very, very scary line stuck waiting at the front desk on Sunday morning (while we were stuck in line at Starbucks) would make anyone never want to attempt a run at that front desk again and hope to catch their flight on time. However, since no initial bill was slipped under our room door for us to preview (??) we checked a box on the Express Check-out envelope requesting a copy of our bill to be mailed. I wonder how long it will take until that copy arrives...

This was true even though the hotel was sold out. Some reviews described the hotel as being quite a walk from the main casino. Actually seemed very close and have walked longer distances from casino to hotel rooms at other resorts. It is just far enough though to be a quiet place to escape to. We thought the lobby area was beautiful, very modern, unusual. Didn\u2019t find anything cold about it as some reviews have stated. Great lobby bar, quieter type place to relax and people watch. Our suite was very clean and the maid service was excellent, although sometimes was well into the afternoon before we received service. I\u2019m sure they take care of rooms of guests that are checking out first. All staff were pleasant and eager to please. Had a couple of small problems - light bulb out and couldn\u2019t get the printer to work. Everything corrected very quickly. Luggage delivery and pick up was very fast. Anytime we called the operator or front desk with a question, we received quick informative answers. But, with 1100 rooms, don\u2019t expect boutique type service. Had a great view, corner room on 30th floor. D\u00e9cor is a little strange and dark, but very comfortable, upscale. Excellent bed.

I could have my coffee without disturbing my mate who slept longer. The caf\u00e9-coffee shop in the lobby had great food and service. Prices not bad compared to other places in the resort. We had a couple meals there. Also enjoyed take out from Red White and Blue. Burger Bar ok, nothing special, over priced. Drink prices at MB seemed higher than everywhere else. $8.50 mixed drink and $6 bottle beer. Ouch. Pool area is a long walk to get to. Very crowded and had to get there early to get a chair.

Let's face it, compared to hotels in most places the resort hotels in Vegas are in another class. If you have never been to Vegas and you stay at the Mandalay Bay, you will find it to be fabulous. In fact you will probably find ALL of the resort hotels to be fabulous if you've never stayed in Vegas before and are comparing them to \"normal\" hotels. But they're NOT normal hotels and we expect more when we shell out big bucks and pick our hotel. And in Las Vegas we can easily find great hotels. Vegas is home to many world class hotels. Unfortunately Manadalay has forgotten what made it successful. I'm not going to go into all of the reasons why I say that because I think many of the other reviewers have already pointed them out. Suffice it to say that I agree with the reviewers who were disappointed. When you go to Vegas, you're going to spend some serious cash. You have every right lto expect world class service and accomodations. You WILL pay for it. Mandalay is a nice resort. But I think it has seen its better days and that its management seems content to let it ride on its past glory. The point is you can do much better. I have stayed at many resorts in Vegas. While I have not stayed at Red Rock or Wynn yet. I have stayed at many including the Venetian and Bellagio and they are clearly a couple notches above Mandalay in many ways. Bottom line, I decided at the last minute to go to Vegas last week. I tried Bellagio, Venetian, Red Rock, Wynn and a couple others. All of them were booked. I called Mandalay and surprise! they had rooms available. I guess that little fact says it best. Maybe they will start paying attention. By the end of your stay you likely will have spent a small fortune and I think you deserve to go home with a feeling that your money was well spent, at least most of it. Your hotel bill will be considerable. I don't believe Mandalay is worth it anymore and I think you can do much better for your money at one of the hotels I mentioned earlier.

This time I could not believe the change. The valet parking guy on checkin was abrupt, unfriendly and not helpfull. Check in was fine, although we were given a suite overlooking the pool and airport - not a problem for me as 50% of us have to accept this view - although I did book and pay for the suite over 3 months ago and told them at the time of booking that we were here to celebrate my 40th birthday and would like a strip view. I also thought that as I had paid for 5 days they would at least acknowledge my birthday - not a mention (unlike the Venetian where we stayed for the last 2 days of our week, who wished me a happy birthday and upgraded the suite). Then the problems. It turned out that I had picked up the wrong case from the airport - my fault 100% not the Hotel. However when I asked the front desk for the concierge to help me contact the airport/airline I was told there was no concierge. I asked if they could help me track down my luggage. Reluctantly they offered to find me the number for the airport. After 20 minutes waiting they came back with a number - turned out to be a fax number. Then came back with another number - which was wrong. They were so unfriendly and unhelpful I ended up logging onto the internet to find the correct numbers. People - this hotel only cares about filling up the rooms and $ - not personal service. The pool area is a joke - by 11.00am there was not a seat to be had anywhere - at $399 a night I would have liked a seat - however with the number of rooms and the hotel being fully booked - this will occur. The casino floor is as good as any in Vegas and the bands at the bar areas in the evenings are superb. The restuarants are excellent, the House of Blues is good also, especially on a Friday night, but this was my only plus point. If you are young at heart, trendy and know what you want this is the place, but if you actually need anything that you would expect from a 5 star hotel, even taking into account this is Vegas, give this hotel a miss - it is too far up it's own arse these days.

Positive points: Check-in: Check-in was swift. As requested, we got a King size bed, non-smoking room with partial strip view on the 29th Floor. Staff was polite and courteous. Those who are worried about the lack of casino, it is literally 2 mins walk away. It is also connected to Luxor via walkway (less tham 5 mins walk) which is very handy as Luxor has some nice shops and a food court. Food: We had buffet at Mandalay Bay and Luxor. Although it is pricier at Mandalay Bay, food and choice is better and definitely worth an extra $4. Also ate at the Burger Bar. Suite: Rooms are very well decorated with neutral colours. Bed is quite comfortable. Bathroom and bathtub are huge. There is even an extra toilet. All the toiletries are replenished everyday. Three TVs is a nice touch. The Mix: Went to the Mix on the 64th floor for drinks to celebrate my birthday. You have to dress smart even for a few drinks. Drinks are very very pricey............but worth it when you see the view. Our flight back was late at night, therefore we requested a late check-out. We were allowed to check-out at 1 pm (usual time 11 am) without any extra cost. Negative Points: The hotel and room are very cold. They keep the air-con at full at all times. It was 88F outside and freezing inside. I had to carry a jacket inside the hotel. We were charged $102 for bar when we hadn't even opened it. One call to the front desk rectified their mistake............so keep an eye on your bill via the tv services. Mandalay Bay is the last hotel on the strip. But the hotel has a free tram (monorail) service that runs every 10 mins and takes you to Luxor and Excalibur.

We really liked the layout of the rooms, especially the bathroom (big tub and shower; dual sinks; 13\" flat screen TV). Never had to wait long for the elevator, especially during peak times.

However, what they fail to tell you, is that NONE OF THEM are open, nor are they expected to be for at least 2 more months! These pools have been closed since novemeber and were supposed to reopen in mid-april but mandalay employees admitted to me that they are not expected to reopen until at least june. There are bulldozers and construction everywhere, so i'm sure they won't be open for some time. What they have available are 2 pools, each approximately the size of the pool in my backyard. At each pool they had about 50-75 chairs available. That makes a grand total of about 100-150 chairs for a hotel holding thousands of people. There were more people laying on the cement around the pool than there were on chairs. Everybody was furious. How dare you not tell your guests that you have none of the pools available including those advertised on THE FRONT PAGE of your website?! Common courteousy demands that you tell a guest paying more than $300 a night for a room that there will be no pool available, especially when you are a hotel in the middle of the desert! The Mandalay did no such thing. This hotel is so pretenious and full of itself that i guess it's attitude toward it's customers should not surprise you.

But the customer service, especially housekeeping, is among the worst I've ever experience at ANY hotel at ANY price (let alone a \u201chigh luxury\u201d property). Check in time is 2pm. So when I arrived at 130pm after a long flight, I was not expecting to get a room. But the desk informed me that housekeeping has \"until 6pm\" to clean rooms and most likely, that's when my room would be ready. I balked, and asked if there was a room a could have sooner. Yes, I was told, but it was a \"VIP\" non smoking suite for $40 more a night. Fine, I said, and they told me it would be ready by 3pm. So I checked my bags and got a bite to eat. At 3pm, the room still wasn't ready, but the desk told me I could drop my bags in it so I could change and freshen up. When I got to the room, it was not only not cleaned, but totally trashed with cigarette butts everywhere. Back to the desk I went, and told them I didn't want the \u201cnon smoking\u201d room and to please give me a regular suite. OK, but gruff, was the desk, and the new room would be clean until 4pm. Now, I'm really getting steamed. 430pm comes and the new room still isn't clean. At this point, I drop my bags anyway and go to the bar. Needless to say, the room wasn't cleaned until 530pm. And then, NO ROBES were in the room for my shower. The next day, I was up early for business and left the room at 830am. Housekeeping was directly across the hall and I gave her a few dollars and asked her to clean my room next. When I got back at 11am, it wasn't clean, and even after complaining, it still didn't get cleaned until 4pm. And this time only one robe, not two, were replaced. On the following day, I specifically called housekeeping to have an \"early\" cleaning, and they still didn't clean the room until 2pm. And turn down service is by request only - something that's standard in most luxury hotels. On the last day, I ordered simple room service breakfast - coffee, juice and a bagel. On the menu, the cream cheese on the side was a whopping $2.00, so I told them just send it up dry. Sure enough, I got the $2.00 small dollop of cream cheese I didn\u2019t order when they delivered my breakfast. For $349 dollars a night, even in Vegas, all of this was a pattern of not only pathetic, but unapologetic customer service. So I complained, for the umpteenth time, to the front desk, to get my room cleaned early for my final day. I told them my total dissatisfaction with my stay to that point, listing every blow-by-blow mess-up so they could understand my frustration. In the end, they took a paltry few dollars off my folio for \"inconvenience\".

We were first given a room facing West (away from the strip and hills). First call, we were told THEhotel didn't really have decent views. I called again - we were given a room facing the strip. Truth is - THEhotel Strip-facing rooms face LUXOR and MandalayBay hotel, BUT you can still see much and parts of the strip over them. It's better, so request it, but you need to be over 25 stories. The gym is annoyingly dark. A nice hotel gym, but really, poorly lit. First day- we made 3 calls to get our in-room bathrobes (not in our hotel room) - they finally came late that night. No pool - you have access to and can use Mandalay Bay's pool(s), with all of the Mandalay Bay guests. The Good: Excellent decor in the rooms; spacious; nicely done lobby; Starbucks in the lobby; lobby away from the gaming (with easy access down a corridor if you want it); Excellent bar and view on top Floor (TheMix) - go for a drink at least; The Excellent: Awesome bathroom and bathtub (fits two comfortably) w/ TV in the room; plasma TVs; The Spa (\"Bathhouse\") even at $30 is one of the best I've been to - well organized, spacious - hotspa, cold plunge, steam room; dry spa; sitting and reading area with healthy foods; The cafe breakfasts are great, and you can make requests that are honored. Overall - this is a hotel trying to be a \"W\" with a Vegas twist. It's dark (not well lit) and all furnishings and lobby are mod. This gets a Neutral because of the extra expenses for an already expensive hotel, and no private pool. Would I stay again?

We chose THE hotel at the mandalay bay resort based on it's unrivalled simplicity and minimalist decor.

The rooms are reputed to be the most spacious in Las Vegas and we believe this may quite possibly be true. Very well designed with an eye for detail.

CONS The only real con is that there is not a spectacular lobby. The main entrance is through an indoor parking garage. The first impression was pretty weak, but it only got better from there. PROS (I will stick to the stuff that matters) The main lobby. As I stated above, I was not impressed at first. However, the fairly intimate lobby has a great lounge and coffee bar. Very comfortable when meeting friends. Also, the lobby is only about 100 yards from the Casino. I was concerned about how far a walk it would be to the casino. You need not be. It's reaaly convenient. The Spa is first class. Really great. Go for the 1 1/2 hour massage. The extra 1/2 hour makes a difference. Restaurants - You can stay here for a week and never repeat a restaurant. The Burger Bar in Mandalay Place has some of the best burgers I've ever had. Try the angus burger with a fried egg and bacon. You won't be sorry. The Rooms - Probably the best part of the stay ws the actual suites. Every amenity you could need.

They both have the same design, the VIP suite just has more space with a panoramic view. I would recommend a simple King Suite would be enough unless u want to pay extra $200 for the same design a night. The regular King Suite is about $200 a night depends on which day of the week.

I used this to my advantage when I checked in. There were not going to let me check in for 2 more hours, but were very nice and accommodating after they heard about my schedule change. They gave us a mid-level V (corner) suite which was perfect. Check in was quick and painless. The overall decor of the hotel is deep and dark with wonderful lighting. I loved it, but I can see how it may not fit into everyone's taste. We loved our room. The corner suites are slightly bigger than the other rooms with a larger bedroom. I think they have one added view window in the bedroom. We loved it and had a dual view of both the back side of the strip (view of the RIO and Palms) and then the front view between Luxor and Mandalay. The room was amazing. We loved the d\u00e9cor, the lighting, the 2 bathrooms, the bathtub which was huge, the plasma tv\u2019s (especially the shark reef channel), THEbath products, all were wonderful. I like this room better than any other hotel room I have stayed in to date in Vegas (and many other locations). Tipped housekeeping and they left a generous amount of bath products for us to take home. Overall A+ Bathhouse Spa: I have a mixed review of this spa. Following the original cancellation of my 80 mins massage, they were able to get me rescheduled for the same time for a 50 min massage. They also gave me an additional discount. My service was wonderful and I loved my therapist. The spa itself left much to be desired. Although I loved the deep, dark colors and designs of THEhotel, I cannot say my reaction was the same for the spa. I prefer warmth and comfort and it was very dark and cold in d\u00e9cor to me. The couches and lounges were not very comfortable, although many people were passed out sleeping on them so they couldn\u2019t be that bad. It was also a very confusing layout, and without someone giving you a map of the spa, it was very difficult figuring out where all the pools, spas, steam and sauna rooms were located. I eventually found them, but it took some work on my part. The eucalyptus steam room was way tooo steamy and way too much eucalyptus. So I couldn\u2019t really enjoy that. They did have plenty of water, fruit, nuts and teas for clients. My preference next time would be to go to Mandalay spa, which both my husband and myself felt we liked better.

The night we arrived we checked in quite late (about 11:30pm) and I was concerned that our room requests would not be able to be accomodated as it was President's Day weekend and the hotel was full.

Plenty of space, three flatscreen televisions (one in the bathroom), a huge bathroom and even a second half bathroom (toilet and sink with vanity). I had some reservations about staying in a hotel without a casino as I do enjoy gambling. However, the Mandalay Bay casino was just a short walk down a hallway from the elevators. There is also a tram that connects the Mandalay Bay to the Luxor and Excalibur and then walkways to other casinos like New York, New York and the MGM Grand. Most of the time we used taxis to get around to the farther hotels but when we had time to spare we took the Deuce bus. So don't let this hotel's location prevent you from staying here.

Theirs a liquor store, McDonalds, Subway, etc, right across the street from Mandalay bay (about 7 min walk, through the taxi cab stand, under the bridge) We visited the other Hotels and let me say. I was excited because when we went up the strip we saw allot of young people (yes i am very young) so that\u2019s when we figured out this is where all the action is. But when we went through the other hotels, we realized that it took 10x longer to find things. I t was a walk to everywhere, and it was crowded, about 20 times the people. So at the end of the day, we were happy that all the action (for young people) were further up the strip and that we could come back to a nicer, quieter and more sophisticated place that we didn\u2019t have to walk mile to just to go to the bathroom. Spots to check out are the Caesers Palace, The MGM. The Caesers Palace has the best Hip hop Club, or should i say clubs (yes they have more than one) for all young people.

We LOVED the floor to ceiling windows in the living and bedroom areas. We also loved the push button (as opposed to a card one hangs on the door) for either housekeeping or do not disturb. On one day that we did not put on the housekeeping light until late afternoon (not expecting that service so late in the day), we got it. The one thing I would have liked would be a coffee maker in the room for that essential first cup of coffee of the day. We were on somewhat of a budget and didn't want to get coffee via room service, so next time I would probably bring my own portable coffee maker for that purpose. We had meals at the Border Grill and House of Blues, both of which were excellent. I had two treatments at the Bathhouse Spa. The treatments were expensive but excellent, and the spa itself was wonderful. I was not charged the daily spa fee for the day I had the treatments. I would have probably used the spa on the other two days if there had not been a $30 fee, and it would be nice if that would have been included for hotel guests. Two other things we really enjoyed: (1) the Shark Reef at the Mandalay Bay; and (2) the Fab Four show at the Alladin. The show was truly amazing - the four performers not only sounded, but actually LOOKED exactly like the Beatles. We are still talking about what a great show it was. Finally, a tip: starting at noon, a booth near the MGM Grand (which looks like a giant Coke bottle) sold half price tickets for all of the shows that night. This was a GREAT deal for anyone on a budget, since the major shows can run upwards of $80 - $100. We did happen to be in Vegas during a slow week (right after the Super Bowl) so all of the tickets might not be available all of the time, but when we showed up to get tickets for the Fab Four, tickets for all shows were available. I'll never pay full price for a Vegas show again. The free entertainment in the lounges at Mandalay Bay was excellent. All in all, a great trip. We will definitely be return guests at TheHotel. I did notice some comments about the staff being \"snooty\" - this was not our experience. Not everyone is comfortable staying at this type of property, and they may have been intimindated by the type of service, but I found it excellent. Anyone who is intimindated should stay a different type of property (TheHotel is New York-style cosmopolitan), as should those who found that staying on the far south end of the Strip a problem. We didn't - we took the (free) monorail as far as the Exclalibur and walked to NY-NY, Paris and the Alladin. It was good exercise. Frankly, we could have stayed in TheHotel/MB complex the entire time had we not seen a show at another hotel.

I've stayed about half of the hotels on The Strip (including Mandalay Bay proper) and this is probably tied with The Venetian for 2nd (Mandalay Bay will always be first) best hotel at a GREAT value. Beautifully designed, hip to no end, the hotel and it's rooms definitely give you the impression you are \"somebody\", even when you're paying a cut rate, LOL. Our suite was beautiful and spacious. While it's a little bit of a walk from THEhotel to the tram or walkway to Luxor/Excalibur, I've seen far worse (like MGM Grand, for example). The only real complain was THEcafe (THEhotel's version of a 24-cafe). Skip it. Overpriced and not particularly good. The Bathouse spa -- DON'T MISS IT. It is expensive, yes. And it is (along with Spa Mandalay) one of the best spas on The Strip, if not the best. IMO, far better than Canyon Ranch at The Venetian. The gym is a bit different (diffused and dimmed red light), but it got the job done. There were individual tv monitors on all the cardio machines. Even the toiletries are simple, clean, and classy. Keep in mind that understatedness is a key to THEHotel's design, and that goes for the lighting as well as the decor. I personally am not much for bright harsh lighting, so it didn't bother me, but a family member in the party wasn't keen on it. If only Mandalay Bay was moved to the center of The Strip it would be the only place I stay at.

It is a short walk to the casino through a beautiful hallway with flower arrangements of calla lillies everywhere! A couple of things that did not impress us. The main entrance to the hotel is through the parking garage which, when you think of other hotels in this class, such as Bellagio and Wynn, is a serious short coming. We also found the waiting area in front of the elevator and the public restrooms to be VERY dark. Check out took in excess of 20 minutes even though we were only third in line. There were two clerks staffing the desk which seems a bit obsurd for 9:30 in the morning.

Had dinner at Rumjungle, excellent service and food. Had sushi another night in the lounge in Mandalay Place and watched sports on one of the many plasmas while we ate. Went to the MIX for a couple drinks and a great view. Service was great. Get there at 5pm to get a good seat. Had fun with the slots, especially the Wheel of Fortune. Most all the slots take cash or tickets, no coin. Which is a lot nicer and cleaner. Two billiards tables in the Lounge by the front lobby are complimentary, just let them hold onto your drivers license. Enjoyed the Lakers game at the Sports Book. Sat at a big table with big cushy chairs and had a great view of the game on a huge screen. Service was great, good drinks. All in all an excellent trip! Some fun things to do..... take the Deuce bus to travel on the strip. Only $2 a person. A lot cheaper than a cab. Or Tram it over to Luxor and Excalibur and then it gets you close to New York, New York, then cross over to MGM and walk down to the Flamingo and have some cheeseburgers and margaritas at Margaritaville. There is a kewl souvenir shop with Jimmy Buffet/Margaritaville stuff. Check out the habitat with the flamingos and penguins. The pools are kewl too. Some things to watch out for....... signs leading to the Hotel are not very informative. Look for the West Valet area, that is where you want to be. It is on the backside of Mandalay. Also, when leaving valet to get on the freeway, do not turn left, go right, towards the strip, then right onto the strip and follow the signs to the freeway. If you are a light sleeper, try to get a room away from the MIX club. You can hear the music. We turned the fan on to drown out the music on Sat. night. Sun night it was quiet.

All of THE Hotel rooms are suites. They are beautiful and well-designed. The living room is nice and functional. It sports an attractive sofa (it's actually a pull-out) and a plasma TV with a DVD player (which, unfortunately, didn't play my DVD-RWs), there is also a desk with fax machine, computer connections.

The Paris is across the street, sports the same central location, and is just slightly less crowded. I suppose the Four Seasons might be nicer, but it's really in a higher class than even THE Hotel.

(5 nites) First, the value was fantastic, as it was the week before Christmas. Very slow week in Vegas, but an excellent week if you want a great room (suite) at a great price. I paid $119 for the first few nites, and then up to $169 for the last two. It also included a $35 meal credit with the promo they were running... along with some other coupons for shopping at Mandalay Place and for the Spa. The Suites are great, you can get descriptions in every other review on here. What impressed me most, was that this was the first hotel where I really felt like I was staying in an apartment. The furnishings are sleek and modern, yet have a warmth to them which makes them very home like. Not too minimalist or cold. Whenever I returned to the room, I felt as if I was returning to my own apartment home, away from home. I have stayed in many other hotels as I travel frequently for work and play to LA, Chicago, and Miami. The only other place I have stayed in Vegas was The Venetian, and I think these suites blow away the ones at The Venetian. Housekeeping was perfect and the other staff I had to deal with were helpful and courtious. I undestand that it was a slow week there, which may be the reason why the service was good. But if you like Vegas a little less crowded than usual, then the two weeks before Christmas are a great time to go. I really like the entire feel of the hotel. The decor is great and hotel floors are quite and the rooms quite also. You would not know there was any other guests in the hotel, except for seeing someone in the halls, as there seems to be no noise coming from the rooms. I am most impressed with the bathrooms and the high quality of their very own line of \"Gilcrist and Soames\" soaps, shampoo and lotions. So good in fact, I bought some in the gift shop for gifts for family and co-workers back home. I was also impressed with the hotel designers for having an electronic button by the door for \"do not disturb\" or \"make up room\". No need for stupid tags which always fall off the door handle or out of the card slot. This is the closest thing that Vegas has to the \"W\" Hotels. If you like the \"W\" Hotels, you will love The Hotel. If there is one complaint I have, it is with the resturants at Mandalay Bay. There really are no resturants in The Hotel other than The Cafe, which was closed for much of my stay. Seems that The Cafe is only open on weekends. I dont mind walking to the resturants in Mandalay, but they totally underwhelm me. I feel like I am always paying too much for what I ate. I don't mind paying good money for meals, but I want to say.. \"that was a good meal\". That was not the case at Mandalay. The meals were average and cost too much. The most satisfying meal I had was at the Burger Bar located in Mandalay Place. But, I still have a problem paying $30 for a Bacon Cheesburger, fries and two beers. This is by far the best \"standard\" room in Las Vegas!! If it is within your budget, I totally recomend staying there. I just re-booked for the end of February, even though the prices are close to $300 a nite.

I have traveled extensively and quite frankly have never felt so compelled to post a review. Having seen many prior reviews describing poor service we opted to still stay at The Hotel as we had made dinner and lounge plans for Mix on New Year\u2019s Eve. Needless to say, 5 minutes into our stay I felt as though we had made a big mistake. Having confirmed a \u201cV\u201d suite two days before with a high floor location, we were checked into the last remaining \u201cV\u201d Suite in the property. It was located on a very low floor but given our 11:00 PM arrival time we opted to take it. The front desk staff were not personable and thus it did not seem like debating the room would get anywhere. Upon entry into the room it became apparent the room was not cleaned. Mind you this was 11:00 PM. Sheets on the bed were tossed and previously eaten room service was still sitting around. Needless to say, we had to trek back down and were given the only other King size bed room in the place. It was not a V suite and was located on a lower floor with what could best be described as a freeway view. The next few days were a continuation of poor service. For New Year\u2019s Eve, despite having spoken on the phone with staff the day before to confirm, we were given a table about as far away from the window as possible at Mix. This, despite the fact that money was paid a month earlier for the specific window view. To make matters worse, a number of closer tables remained empty during our 9:00 PM sitting. It was obvious that they tables were being held for \u201cmore important\u201d guests. Finally, 4 courses into the dinner the manager showed up to offer us one of the other tables. Quite frankly, it was more insulting as it clearly substantiated the fact that tables were being held for potential last minute reservations. With Mix serving what was a very poor dinner, this was most disappointing considering the nearly $2,600 spent for the two us at the restaurant and lounge (bottle service) for the night. Additional experiences proved disappointing at the Hotel over the next few days. Having room service removed from the room (or hall after many calls), was an absolute impossibility, and daily maid service was very poor. The two most disturbing occurrences at the Hotel occurred the last day. Looking to stay in Vegas another night, I stopped at the front desk to extend our stay one more day (same person whom checked us in). After some transitioning through their system, he quoted a room rate, and said it was taken care of. With this, we made our way back upstairs and changed all of our flight reservations. The next morning we receive a phone call from housekeeping asking us why we have not, and when are we going to vacate our room. With this, a call was made to the front desk only to be told the hotel was sold out for the night and that there was no way to extend the room. Keep in mind, all travel reservations had been changed. After some extremely tense \u201cconversations\u201d with the front desk, they agreed to \u201chonor\u201d the extended stay. Last but not least, that afternoon we finally transitioned to the bathrooms to get ready to find that the Hotel has experienced a water problem and no water exists. Four hours later semi-warm water began to disburse from some facets, however, through our departure at 5:45 AM the next morning the shower had NO hot water. Once again, front desk help maintained the attitude of take it or leave it. No \u201cluxury\u201d hotel staff at any other Vegas property would ever take this approach. I have stayed at many and while they have their problems, Bellagio, Wynn, the Four Seasons, or other 4- 5 star properties would ever be so unaccommodating. Thus, I have to agree with reviews posted earlier pertaining to the Hotel that put service far down the spectrum. The hotel is beautiful and the rooms are up there with the leaders in Vegas, however, the staff and support services associated with the Hotel have much to be said for.", "Date": "January 4, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "California", "Title": "\u201cHangover Heaven\u201d", "Author": "HikaruDragon", "ReviewID": "UR4321968", "Content": "If you are sick of the glitz, glitter and gaudiness that is Las Vegas, this is the place you need to stay, especially if you've had way too much to drink.

Could you pay more (a lot more!) for a 3000 square foot Presidential Suite at the Bellagio? Yes. But in terms of paying the basic rate for a hotel room, you cannot beat THEhotel! Rooms are just under 800 square feet, with two bathrooms (one by the front door and one in the bedroom) and three flat screen TVs: A huge one in the living room, a good size one in the bedroom, and even a small one in the bathroom facing the shower. I had three games going at once on Sunday! Carpet is nice and thick, huge fax machine (with paper!) on the desk for your use, and they have a Do Not Disturb red light button you can turn on (instead of those annoying hanging cards that always fall off the door). Decor is very classy and sleek. Seems a bit dark at first, but plenty of overhead lights and lamps to lighten things up. Great ergo desk chair, and a few lounge chairs in both rooms make it very comfortable. Wet bar is a nice touch (with wine and drink glasses, corkscrew, etc.); CD player is also great...in fact the room is so modern, there is no VCR (though I would have liked one.) Great toiletries in the bathroom, nice big glass shower and huge two-person tub, but for that size, you would think they could have made it a jet tub, but they didn't. No casino in the hotel, but since it is connected to Mandalay Bay, you don't have to go outside to gamble...just walk thru the lobby, down the hallway and you're there. But I think this is the best feature of the hotel: It's nice and sophisticated and quiet if you don't stray far...but if you want the noise and lights of a casino, you don't have very far to go. Didn't get a chance to see the spa, as they were fully booked for the day we wanted, so I went to the Four Seasons' Spa (the third hotel at Mandalay Bay), and it was amazing. Quiet, great lockerooms, great staff, couples massage room, top notch! Since it was winter, all the Mandalay pools were closed except for one, but it was even too cold to swim in that one, and yes, the pools did seem far from the rooms at THEhotel, but not that much farther from some of the rooms at Mandalay Bay itself. We asked for a second fridge and a microwave to be brought up to the room, and they were given at no charge. The front desk and the concierge service overall seemed a bit cold at first. Only two or three people at the front desk, and two concierge guys, and they were not extremely helpful or the \"going out of their way\" type to ask you what you need. But the group on the second day seemed much friendlier. For a hotel with over 1000 rooms on a sold out weekend, it did not seem crowded at all. No lines at the bars, coffee places, shops, etc. The prices aren't that bad either. You can easily get rooms for under $200 on weekdays, and we ended up paying only $169 for a Saturday night on a holiday weekend. And here's a tip: Book thru the hotel directly...they will always give you the lowest rate, but you MUST keep checking back on their website to see if the price drops at anytime before your stay. I booked my room 6 months in advance, and after a month, the price dropped from $209 to $189, so I \"rebooked\" at that time, and then a few months later, it dropped down to $169, so I \"rebooked\" again! Bottom line: Why would you want to stay anywhere else for the same price if the standard rooms at THEhotel will always be bigger and nicer than any other hotel's standard rooms? Plus, you get to take advantage of all the Mandalay Bay facilities at no extra charge, and can even have access to the Four Seasons Hotel without ever going outdoors...how can you beat that? And the only two recent negative reviews of the hotel on this website are very misleading. One person admitted that they took forever to check into the \u201cMandalay Bay\u201d desk, because they didn\u2019t know that THEhotel had their own check-in desk! And one of the latest negative reviewers, in my opinion, actually stayed at \u201cMandalay Bay\u201d and NOT at THEhotel; because, they kept describing things that are not in THEhotel! For instance, they state that the maid kept rolling her cart over the \u201ctile hallway floors,\u201d but all the floors outside THEhotel guest rooms are carpeted!!!

This was a little annoying since they adverstise as being an all suite hotel, but since it was late we didn't really care. They knocked $50 off the rate and promised we'd be able to move \"first thing\" in the morning. Our main concern was that we had to be at a wedding by 1:30 the next day and wanted to be settled in our new room by them. Nothing available on the first try at 9:30am. At 11:30am we were told that check in wasn't normally until 3:00pm and that they were doing us a \"courtesy\" by moving our room at all. Things got a little heated at this point and we returned to our room. About 2 minutes later the front desk called to apologize and say they had a suite for us and we could move right away. Go figure. Other than the above problem TheHotel was great. The suites are top notch with a huge master bathroom, living room area, etc.. I've stayed at Bellagio and Venetian and I would say these rooms are better. Everyone else we dealt with was very friendly. We had breakfast at TheCafe a couple of mornings and it was very good.

I didn't let this affect the above average review, as I know it can happen at any hotel - it was certainly not due to a cleanliness issue. We had a suite booked, but when we arrived the front desk offered to give us a last minute deal to take a regular room instead. They must have been overbooked. We took them up on the offer. The style is excellent - modern with dark/light contrasting furniture and decor. Nice granite in the bathroom. Our room was a little small, but we knew what we were getting into when we took the regular room offer instead of the suite. The room was very clean. The staff was friendly and helpful as well. Its location within the Mandalay Bay is convenient. Unfortunately The Hotel doesn't have its own pool, so you share use of the Mandalay Bay \"Beach\". They do need a bigger pool area - it was WAY overcrowded. It looks like they tried to alleviate this by building a second, separate pool area, but it's kind of out of the way and not very interesting (it's just a pool with a bar and some lounge chairs). As I said earlier, the only issue we had was with bed bugs! I found a couple small flat reddish bugs tumbled up in the duvet toward the end of our stay. I didn't think too much about them - I just flushed them away. The next day (getting home), my husband and I had bites all over our arms. Trailing from our fingers to elbows in neat little lines. I started looking on the web and found that, sure enough, those were bed bugs! Ewww! But we survived, the bites healed, we moved on.

The hotel's association with Mandalay Bay gives guests full access to one of better, more upscale hotels with great amenities. The pool facility at Mandalay Bay is the best on the Strip. The spa on the second floor is beautiful, well-laid out, and staffed attentively. My wife liked her massage and other treatments but thought they were a bit pricey for what they were. Oh well. The gym was small but complete. The nominal daily spa/gym fee was annoying but was successful in minimizing traffic, so the facility was actually very calming and serene. Shopping amenities at THEhotel (as it calls itself) are limited to things that you'd need immediately: bottled water, Starbuck's coffee, a bar. However, excellent shopping is one corridor away at the Mandalay Bay. The food at the little restaurant onsite was very good and reasonably priced, which brings me to my only beef with this place. The morning we arrived, I got up early and headed down for breakfast and was told by the rather insolent hostess that \"We're not open.\" She did NOT voluteer that they were going to open in just five minutes. Instead, she waved me off to a place called \"Raffles,\" Mandalay Bay's 24-hour coffee shop on the FAR end of adjacent hotel. Returning from my expensive, Denny's-like breakfast, when I saw the yummy breakfast my parents were eating in the dining room of our own hotel, I got really mad at that hostess.

You needed to go through the casino and over to the Mandalay Bay elevators near their reception desk. Also, the hot water in the shower would not maintain a constant temperature even when bathing at non-peak times. Shockingly, the parking lot was easy to access and it was complementary.

It took a little while but eventually they let us check-in. It was so nice, after a 5 hour flight, to go right up to the room. The guests before us had taken anything that was not bolted down and none of it was replaced. We had to request everything from a robe, slippers, pen, stationery, etc. All of these things are standard and we should not have had to request them. One other thing that kept our experience from being perfect is a problem we had with a room credit. We prepaid our room bill due to the nature of our stay. It turns out that we overpaid and were not told until the time we checked-in. We were told we could just use to credit for room service, etc. Well, when we tried to use the credit for room service they would not allow us too. It took some argument but we were able to get the overpayment credited back to our credit card. The views from our room were spectacular.

My husband and I decided to stay at this hotel because it was a special occasion and we wanted something extra special. FORGET IT!!!! I wish so badely we had just saved the money and stayed at Mandalay Bay instead. First of all, we checked in and were given our room , which right away I thought was very mediocre. The bathroom had a small tub and shower and was just very stark. The rooms are very dim...decor sleek and minimal. But so dark...you may as well be in a tunnel rather than a hotel room. Furthermore, the lights in the bathroom were out. After about an hour in our room someone from maintanence just opened the door to the living room and announced they were from engineering and that they had come to fix the bathroom lighting. I had not even called them...so thanks for the prompt attention to detail...but try knocking before you just enter a room which is occupied. Needless to say...we were very startled...and not dressed at the time! Good thing there is an entry into the living room first. The gentleman just lingered there for a minute after we told him to get out...and then finally left! I have stayed in many many hotels in my life...some of them very fine...and this has never happened...not even in the crummy ones. This is an invasion of privacy big big time! After our first very average nights stay here we found out that my other friends who were also staying in this hotel had a very different room than us. Their room had a HUGE bathroom with a beautiful tub and shower. We finally realized (too late) that we had been given a handicapped accessible room with a very small bathroom and living room. I was furious! Why were we not informed at the time we checked in that this was the room we were paying the \"extra\" money for??? And by the way, our friends checked in hours after us...so they couldn't tell us that there was an availability issue. When we did finally go downstairs to complain...they acted like they could care less. The front desk and staff there are very arrogant and seem to think they are above it all. I think the reason the hotel is so dimly lit has nothing to do with the hip and chic atmosphere they are trying to create. It has more to do with the fact that they are trying to cover up the mediocrity that is really their hotel! It also boasts about having a seperate entrance from the other parts of Mandalay Bay. The seperate entrance is if you leave the property and go elsewhere in Vegas. If you are going to the Casino, or the pool or spa....you will have to walk 10 miles thru the other hotel anyway...so there really isn't a seperate entrance. Eventually we were given a very small compensation for our troubles. No where near where it should have been for so many complaints.

First I read about the nightmare check in. We had NO PROBLEMS with check in. We arrived at 10 am we were told that our room would be ready in a half hour but instead it was ready in less than 10 mins! I read that the front desk and housekeeping staff were rude... well, they were wonderful with us! Since my husband was attending a convention I choose to sleep in, leaving the \"Do Not Disturb\" sign on most of the day. Housekeeping went as far as to call me later in the day to see if I wanted them to come clean the room and asked what time would be best FOR ME! At one point I was walking towards my room and passed a housekeeping crew (which by the way greeted me EVERYTIME I passed them!) I asked them if I could get two feather pillows when they had a minute and I was told that it was no problem they would bring them right away, I walked down the hall, entered my room and before I could turn the TV on they were at my door! Our experience at the Mandalay Bay was AWESOME! We were pampered and treated wonderfully. I don't have anything negative to say about them. After staying there and seeing some of the other guest the conclusion I came to was that there are a lot of \"snobby\" people staying there. The type that would complain no matter what. The type of people that nothing would make them happy. It is just one of those things that you have to deal with when you stay at a 4 or 5 star hotel. We had the same type of thing went we stayed at the Grand Lido in Negril Jamaica, there was a couple that actually complained to the hotel that they didn't feel they should have to carry their own plates from the buffet to their table! The hotel actually had two people follow them around the buffet and after the fixed their plates they would set their plates down and walk to their table without a word! No thank you NOTHING! And after treating the staff like their personal slaves they STILL complained that they were not quick enough! Some people are just spoiled children in adult bodies, nothing will ever be good enough for them. So when you read any negative reviews keep in mind that most people will treat you the same way you treat them and in most cases the people complaining probably treated the staff poorly. One more thing, if you do stay at the Mandalay Bay or even if you don't, be sure to go to the House of Blues in the hotel! We were lucky enough to attend a private party there and treated to a night of GREAT music with the house band.... which btw is Jim Belushi's band! They were FANTASTIC!

Rest of the Mandalay bay facilities we tried (top floor bar/restaurant, night club etc, casino itself) seemed so-so and pricey - had better luck taking the free railway to other places.", "Date": "October 18, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta, GA", "Title": "\u201cThe hotel, better than expected\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4029420", "Content": "My wife and I visited THEhotel Oct 12 - 16. This was our 6th trip to Vegas. We have stayed at Bellagio (twice), Paris, Aladdin and Mandalay Bay. We greatly enjoyed our visit this trip. I will try to hit on all the points I can, because that helped me make my trip to THEhotel better was reading the reviews from others. Cab ride to THEhotel - make sure you tell your driver several times to take you to THEhotel entrance. If you are not clear about it, they will take you to the Mandalay Bay entrance, then you have 1/2 mile walk with your luggage to the registration. We had read about that, and the driver from the airport tried to take us to the Mandalay entrance. We saw a lot of other guest roaming through the casino with their luggage who didn't know to ask specific. The drivers do it on purpose, bacasue there are not that many people to pick up at the other drop off. Check in - I called to confirm my reservations 3 times during the day of check in bacause we were checking in at midnight and had read the horror stories. Our check in went with out problem. I tried hard to get a strip view and we did, however you need to be on at least the 25 floor to see over the Luxor. So make sure if you ask for a strip view, ask for a floor higher than 25. (The $20 trick got the strip view, not over the Luxor view). Room - Great room. The separation of the living and bedroom was great. I watch TV while my wife got dressed in separate rooms. Yes there is a HUGE plasma TV in the living room, but it is not feed with digital cable so you cannot get plasma technology without the digital cable, so it looks like a regular TV, only bigger. The large bathroom was great. Big tub and shower. Having a 1/2 bath in the living room was great. I set up my stuff in there, that way she could have the whole bathroom to herself. Closet space was just fine. There is plenty of room unless you bring 6 suitcases. The bed was the best thing. It compairs to a Heavenly Bed if you are familiar with the Westin. Casino - You use the casino at the Mandalay Bay. My wife and I have never been a fan of the MB casino and this trip proved no different. High limits on thier table games ($15 min). Even at the empty tables, we begged them to drop the min to $10 and no luck. The good thing is that there is a walk thru to the Luxor where we found smaller minimums, plus our ONE card can be used at the Luxor for comps, etc. Dining - we ate at the 24 hour Cafe our first night. It was 2:30 am. The place was 50% full. We sat for 30 minute and noone had helped us. The table next to us had been there an hour and just gotten their food. We actually bought their quesadilla from them for $20 and left. Very poor service at this cafe. We also ate at the Sushi Bar in the casino. Bill was $100 for normal sushi order and one of the worst I have had. I don't recommend this place. 3950 restaurant we ate at on the 3rd night. I really enjoyed this place. Great service and food. First class place. Pool - MB has the best pool area out there on the strip. It has something for all ages. We chose the Moorea Beach Club on Friday of our visit. The reason was because it is an over 21 only pool. Great place, we stayed for over 6 hours and had a very relaxing time. Drinks are too expensive, but so what. Yes the pool did have some topless sunbathers, but it is not a sexual thing. It's not like a Cinemax movie or anything, so don't expect that. The walk to the pool is fine. Just go through the convention center, it will save you 10 minutes. SPA - my wife had a message and she said it was great, one of the best. I hung out in the men spa for an hour while she was busy. Sap had everything you could want and the prices were reasonable. Overall - Very modern, mature place to stay. For the price, we got more than expected. Bottom line...we did see some \"unhappy\" people similar to what I had read about, but I would not treat these people kindly either. Most of the people who felt that they were treated bad had a bad additude. \"treat me like royalty becasue I am in Las Vegas\" personality is what we saw. My wife and i put a smile on our face and were polite when we had a request and each time we were given what we thought was fair from the staff at THEhotel.", "Date": "October 17, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Denver, CO", "Title": "\u201cUnreliable\u201d", "Author": "Denveresque", "ReviewID": "UR4020888", "Content": "We reserved a suite (and paid a one night deposit) at THEHotel in May '05, for an October Vegas trip to attend the Grand Sumo Tournament at the Mandalay Bay. My boyfriend and I do not gamble and wanted to avoid maneuvering through large and crowded casinos every day just to get to our suite or leave the property, so the THEHotel was perfect for us. We also prefer a modern, minimalist decor, and again THEHotel was ideal for our requirements. The morning before we headed out to Las Vegas, I read the negative review on this site regarding THEHotel not honoring its reservations. I became concerned and called the hotel that morning to confirm our reservation and assure them that we were checking in that night. The phone attendant confirmed our reservation and uttered the obligatory \"looking forward to welcoming you\". We arrived at THEHotel a little before 6pm, and waited in line to check in. Many parties checked in ahead of us without incident, and another 3 parties were checking in at the desk at the same time we were. When the attendant found our reservation, she excused herself and retreated to the back office. Meanwhile, the other guests around us were continuing to check in. When the attendant returned, she cheerfully announced that a suite was prepared for us at the Mandalay Bay hotel, as though she was announcing that we had just hit the jackpot. I was offended by how the bad news of the cancellation of our confirmed reservation was dressed up and served up to as as good news, something we should be grateful for. My boyfriend and I objected, and indicated that we did not want to stay at the Mandalay Bay, but at THEHotel which we had selected after careful research, had reserved and paid a deposit on six months earlier, and had confirmed that same morning. The matter was escalated to a supervisor, who apologized about the inconvenience and told us that they had exceeded capacity. I complained that they were meanwhile checking more people in, including those who came up to the front desk after us, and that they obviously had rooms to give away to other guests. After much unpleasantries and an interminable run-around, they did not give us our room, and gave us a suite at the Mandalay Bay hotel. This is one atrociously run hotel with an arrogant and incompetent management. There is nothing worse for a traveler to arrive and have his or her reservation unilaterally and summarily revoked. That put a damper on our entire trip. We did not appreciate the shoddy treatment we received at THEHotel. Would they have refunded our one-night deposit had we no-showed, even while they had secretly and uncereminously cancelled our reservation? Not a chance.

But everything about it--from the understated elegance and spaciousness to the bath amenities to the three plasma televisions in the suite to the comfortable beds, extra half bath, and quality towels and linens--was a notch above most other hotels in Vegas and well worth the extra expense. It was wonderful having a separate living room with plenty of seating and an extra bath. The main bathroom was huge and luxurious with tons of storage space. Someone else complained about the clothing storage space in the room but there were two huge lighted closets with lots of shelves and hooks and tons of hangers, plus an armoire with six drawers. We had more than enough space for four people's wardrobes for the week. We checked in early afternoon on a Saturday and got a nice strip view and quiet room on the thirteenth floor. The elevators are the best and fastest I've ever encountered anywhere (and I live in NYC). You never had to wait more than a few seconds for one to arrive. Ever. I loved that there were separate climate controls in the bedroom and living room as my husband likes arctic temps and likes to stay up late watching television and I love to be cozy and read in bed. We tipped the maid well each day and got extra towels as requested, plentiful toiletries, and all the soap was replaced each day with fresh, wrapped bars. Everything was spotless. I loved the convenience of the coffee bar a few feet from the elevators--you could dash down and grab a cup first thing in the morning. The lobby was on the small side for Vegas--a big plus IMO. It was very quiet and manageable, not jammed with tourists. If you want a crowded \"extravaganza\" hotel, you need to go elsewhere. This was convenient--everything you needed--valet, taxis, registration, bar, coffee, restaurant, sundries shop--was a few steps from the elevator. If you've been to Vegas, you know this isn't the norm. This reminded me of a NYC boutique hotel. We had our two well-behaved children with us and everyone was pleasant and friendly to them; I was needlessly worried in advance about the level of sophistication and the staff's reaction to kids. The pool was a pleasant walk away--I could see where it would be a problem for the elderly, toddlers, or anyone not in decent shape or used to physical activity. But we enjoyed the walk and were glad our room wasn't in proximity to the hordes of people, nois and action by the pool. Because there have been so many complaints about service at THEhotel, I want to mention that the desk staff was really friendly, and the room service waiter on Saturday night was wonderful, as was the waiter in the restaurant Sunday morning--just extra personable and very accomodating. The casino and Mandalay Place mall were handy--nearby but not in the way. And the monorail and food court in the Luxor came in handy. Everyone in THEhotel itself was efficient and pleasant. My one complaint: Valet parking cracked a taillight on our rental car (we hadn't used it the entire time we were there, since checking in) and we didn't realize it until we were 1/2 hour away. Bottom line: if you want a bargain or a flashy, typical Vegas experience, this isn't the place for you.

It was 2:00ish so we decided to just walk around and check things out for a while and come back closer to 5:00. We had left our bags with the bell desk at Manafaly Bay (the shuttle dropped us off at the wrong entrance). We went up to our room at 4:45 excited to get unpacked and get ready for dinner. I was very suprised to find that my room was deadbolted from the other side and that I could hear someone talking on their cell phone inside. My boyfriend and I went downstairs to the front desk and they siad that the occupant had requested a late check out and hadn't checked out yet. Are you kidding me? They gave us a new room and we went back upstairs. Well the new room was empty which was a start. However, the former occupants room keys were on the nightstand and there was used soap in the shower and bathroom. Yuck. I hope that they at least changed the sheets. The rest of our stay was fine - our room was cleaned really late in the day but we didn't really care. Our bathroom smelled awful and smelled worse as the trip went on.

It was actually a good thing that it woke us up because we had forgotten to set an alarm the night before but not a very pleasent way for anyone to start their day.

Despite having reserved a suite as early as July, upon arrival the desk clerk left us standing at check-in for a full 10 minutes while she disappeared into a back office. While waiting we observed that arrivals on either side of us were either in irrate, animated conversations with their clerks, or had been left waiting as we had. Upon our clerk's return we learned why. We (too) were told the suite we had booked was not available, due \"to a convention\", and that we were instead to be be put in an executive suite in the Mandalay Bay. Just as those other arrivals all up and down the desk (we counted 5 harried clerks; the arrival next to us had booked her room SIX MONTHS earlier), we declined, explaining that we had booked The Hotel because we wanted a quiet, upscale, non-casino atmosphere hotel, all of which we knew the Mandalay Bay was not. The clerk, like all of the other clerks, was clearly embarrassed and uncomfortable with what she had been instructed to do by management, was unable to explain how or why a \"convention\" had (obviously, and IF true) been booked after a great many single reservations had been made and in full knowledge those reservations would then not be honored, and could only continue to repeat that we would be getting an executive suite in the Mandalay Bay instead. Finally, I requested our $283 deposit be refunded, we would go elsewhere. Only then did she suggest The Hotel could offer a regular room...in The Hotel. This too, and equally obviously, had been management's instruction to its put-upon employees should a guest balk at what management was attempting to have them do. Weary from our flight, and equally weary of trying to get a straight answer as to how this could have happened, we said fine, we would take it. The clerk then said The Hotel would \"comp\" us the difference between the rate of the suite we had booked 3 months earlier and the regular room we were being provided(!). No offers of a complimentary dinner, or breakfast, nada. The room was upscale, nicely outfitted, certainly smaller than a suite but nevertheless satisfactory given the alternatives...until my wife discovered a hand towel with blood on it...and a washcloth with mascara smears. Now, they were neatly folded, so it is possible the previous guest folded them and they were thus not noted by housekeeping - but of course upon checkout EVERY piece of linen in EVERY room should be changed. In this room (4915) it had not been. My wife notified the front desk, in person. The front desk apologized, said housekeeping would be advised. That was it. Not really the reaction one would expect. Clearly, management of The Hotel had either booked a convention in full knowledge it would mean not honoring bookings already in place and for which deposits had been taken, or were engaging in classic bait-and-switch. A Motel 6 would not do either. Why a capably and responsibly managed hotel would do so is beyond my capacity to rationalize, however I can say that in our 2 days at The Hotel we saw no evidence of a convention whatsoever. We did see 2 small group meetings listed on a board, that was all. The Hotel did not seem overly busy to us. Based on our experience, and of what we observed other guests experiencing, we would strongly advise avoiding The Hotel until the management has been replaced.

My husband and I were traveling with our 2 year old and were looking for a nice room that offered a two room suite option. THE hotel was the only place I found with a two room suite option as a basic room, we could put our son to bed and relax without having to worry about waking him up! After reviewing all of the feedback on this hotel I was worried that we were in for a big disappointment and feared that I had made a bad decision. Upon arriving I couldn't have been more pleased with the room and the atmosphere was great as well. We arrived and one of our non-smoking rooms reeked of smoke and so the hotel send an air purifier to remidy the problem quickly. Minor dilemma, fixed promptly. Room service food was pretty basic, nothing fancy, but there are plenty of restaurants in the Mandalay Bay to pick from if you are looking for excellent food. We didn't eat in any of THE hotel restuarants so I can't comment on the quality. Throughout our stay we were fortunate to have great service from the travel concierge and housekeeping. We called for a pack and play and it was delivered within 20 minutes and the travel guide was able to help us find some great activities for our son! We also left our son's blanket, pillow, and special security blanket in the room. THE hotel was nice enough to locate the items send them to our home in Florida. Very nice hotel, great atmosphere, helpful staff, and a super comfy bed! I can't speak to the friendliness of the desk staff because my husband checked us in and out of the room, but everyone I encountered was friendly and helpful. The only downside I noticed was that the walk to the pool is a long one, so if you go take all you need to stay a while and it is very crowded, and it often hard to find an open seat. You will need your key to enter, I guess they are trying to keep the guests from inviting all of their friends at other hotels to party with them.

I read with some trepidation about the terrible service at THEhotel and went in expecting to have a nice room with bad service (but, it's Vegas and when are you really in your room anyway?) I can only say that the people with negative reviews don't understand how Vegas works. Toss some cash around and you'll get what you need ahead of the schmucks who don't. Upon check-in, I laid a simple $20 on our guy and he told us if we needed anything or a change of rooms, let him know. We didn't care about a strip view room or anything. \"We\" were six guys out there for my 39th birthday. All we needed were two ajoining rooms. He took care of us and we had a HUGE HUGE room with the doors opened to both suites. Now, for those of you who travel enough, you'll appreciate THEhotel and it's lack of tacky Vegas touches. It's quiet, serene and very much like a W or even kind of like the Park Hyatt in Chicago or Tokyo. The suites aren't as big as I expected but it's better than a small, crapped room. We asked that our desk, fax and any business related items be removed and it seems that the $20 was still working. They were gone ASAP. All the lights worked and not one spec of dust anywhere as reported in other reviews. Room service came fast and accurate even at 3 or 5 am with six hungry and relatively loud and unruly guys waiting. We even laid a $20 on our chamber maid who was more than happy to leave us TRIPLE our towels (we all take two or three showers a day) everyday for us. The bar guys at the South Lagoon Pool loved us (I'm not a drinker but our pool bar tab everyday was $450). The only time we had any service issues were with the Morrea Beach line and door guys (yes, the pool even has a VIP list and a wait). The bottom line is simple: TIP the people who can make things happen. The check-in person, the valet, the chambermaids, room service...remember people, they ALL talk and say who are tippers and who are jerky people who shall get nothing and like it. Don't forget your host(es) at Mix. They ALL talk. Overall, the rooms are very nice, beds are great (Think Westin Heavenly), THEhotel tower is way off the casino noise and you even have your own cab stand.

Also, a minor con is the lack of a stereo sound system in the room - the DVD player and TV sound must function as the audio system - Hard Rock suites have dedicated sound systems.

This is important to know coming from the east I was always ready to go to the pool by 8am. We also went to Moorea Beach Club. This was a mistake only because a storm rolled in after we were there just a hour. If you go - go early and when it is a guarenteed nice day. Women seemed perfectly comfortable without their tops. The men that were there didn't seem to be there just to see topless women. Women outnumber men 2-1 probably because $10 for women $50 for men! If you don't want to drop your top it is OK. Best things about Moorea - the music, the comfy chairs, a great hot tub, and no kids. The drinks at the pools are very expensive, though. The Tram in Mandalay Bay that runs to the Luxor and Excalibar is very useful. You can walk through the casinos but it gets confusing. We spent alot of time at the Nine Fine Irishmen a pub in NY NY.

Our needs were met for the most part. We enjoyed the pool. We hung at Mandaly Beach during the day. Swimming was cool and a little crowded, and it was very hot. It felt like someone was running a hair dryer in front of your mouth the whole time. BATHHouse: I reserved a deep tissue massage and it was great. She listened to what I said was hurting and executed the massage well. As far as the locker room / spa facility: it has a weirdness to it. It kind of felt like walking into a \"Clockwork Orange.\" If you do get a massage, you will have full use of the weight room, whirlpools, showers and steam-rooms for that day which is nice if you feel like working out in a pseudo-spaceship with an atmospheric trance breathing all around you. Anyway, the massage was good. Gambling: Minimum bets on the table games were $10 during the day and they went up to $15 after 6pm. Overall, the hotel was nice and clean, showing a litlle wear and tear in the rooms, but nonetheless nice. Bathrooms are big and spacious with an enormously deep bathtub. Plasma Tv's in 3 separate rooms. The bed is comfortable and the sheets sedative. Room service dropped the ball once though. I ordered a prime rib with a baked potato and it showed up lacking silverware and au-jus. -No extras with the potato either. The potato was all that I got. No butter, no cheese, chives , or sour cream, bacon, etc. This is the best part. When I called to ask about the sides for the potato and also for the au-jus/silverware, the supervisor told me it did not come with those sides(cheese, butter, etc.) and that I would have to pay extra for it. I don't know when 5 star adopted that policy, but for whatever reason my common sense told me to have them come back and pick it up because I wasn't about to pay for that lousy cold slab of moistless boring meat. My 2 cents. I guess if you don't mind paying $289 plus tax, have fun and stay here. It can be a lot of fun. Rock Star Kareoke at the House of Blues is way cool.

THE Hotel is probably a fair representation about what is good and what is bad about Vegas. So let's start from the beginning-when you drive up, expect a byzantine maze of parking garage with taxi's and traffic everywhere before you get to the entrance of the hotel, which is in the garage. The valet was great, and took our car and arranged for a bellman who came over immediately. He directed us to the direction of the front desk, which is at the end of a stunning lobby with a lounge to the left and coffee shop to the right. Bear in mind, our flight arrived at 9am so we asked for early check in. The lady who checked us in was very kind and went through extra trouble to get us a corner suite on the 31st floor, with a knockout view of the strip. Bags were brought up quickly by a super guy who showed us suite features and grabbed ice for us along with a pleasant conversation on \"whats hot\" in Las Vegas. The suite itself was well designed, with nicely finished walls, carpet and bathroooms and with a cheap quality couch, bed, armoire and cabinets that made you wonder if the interior decorator ever had converations with the furniture buyer. Kind of like a $3000 Chanel dress with a rhinestone necklace. The Plasma TV's were smaller than we have at home but they worked fairly well. The carpet -was stained and the mini-bar was dusty. Our encounters with Hotel staff were very positive-all were professional, cheerful, helpful and proud to be a part of the THE Hotel. But using the phone and dealing with personnel over the phone was another story, until someone told us that Mandalay Bay handles the calls. This explains a lot-you get treated like an annoyance, rather than a guest. And we had VIP designation so you really have to wonder. But face to face, all of the staff were wonderful. Room service was very fast and very good. Try a Lobster, Brie and Asparagus Omlette-an excellent choice. But you know, this is not the Bellagio or the Wynn or the Four Seasons. Having been guests at each of those hotels, we can truly say that this one is more on par with the Venetian, another good 4-star choice. They need to upgrade their furniture, art choices and level of service. Is it to much to have an operator greet you by name? Computer technology can take care of this. Is it too much to have a clean well-maintained suite? Is it too much to have security posted at elevators at night to ensure that only guests or their invited guests go upstairs? These are areas that are the difference between a 4 star and a 5 star.

The lobby, bar, coffee bar and restaurants were all nice and at expected price points for a hotel (for example, no higher than when I was at MGM). I must admit I read the reviews a hundred times and looked at all the pictures. The suite actually was bigger than what the pictures show and the whole building quite beautiful. The only misstep at this place is housekeeping/room services are just not the best. For example, I was very disappointed to leave the room in the a.m. and to return at 6 pm and find our breakfast trays still there and beds unmade and towels not changed. There were also an assortment of bad service-related complaints (mistaken wakeup calls at 5 am, bedroom phone line dead, towels/toilet paper not left in powder room, wet carpet near the a/c). It was very disappointing to see such a so-so service level. If I was paying the 300/nt weekend rate I would expect better housekeeping and service and would have been completely upset by some of these things. I've read enough reviews to know that this is THE HOTEL's one pitfall. I told them at checkout. They said please try us again because they are working on it. Otherwise this property is excellent. The 3 TVs in the room were fun (although not many channels). Even the elevators have TVs. Here's some tips: Sign up at their web site for the paradise club and book directly on their hotel reservation site. Rates for the paradise club members went as low as $149/nt for THE HOTEL (and dirt cheap for mandalay). Expedia was quoting 199 each time I checked and didn't include 2-for-1 coupons, the extras you get by doing this. I signed up but forget to check that email box regularly and the special rates expired. (You will get only 1 or 2 emails from them unlike other properties, so pay attention.) Still, I stayed M-F 7/18-7/22 for 169/nt on the 30th floor with a pool-side view which I felt was a good price and good location. In reality, this is not an expensive price for a 2 bath, 2 room suite that really includes all the amenities you could ask for. At check-in I was given a VIP room card because of being on that email list. I got some deals that I forgot about that had been in the emails I received from the hotel. (At least I think that's why.) Also, my bar and refrigerator were fully stocked with all kinds of goodies, beverages, liquors, etc.. We ate containers of junk food, drank beverages and coronas and were only charged $15. If you have children 14 and under, they no longer charge the extra person fee for the room. That's a savings of $35 a night. Go to the Shark Reef after 5 pm. The admission prices are lower and the lines much shorter. We went about 9 pm. It was nice, but if I had stood in line for that or paid more than I did I would have been disappointed. Sea World it ain't. Also you are able to monitor what is being charged to your room on the television. It updates instantly. Just choose Guest Services. For example, we charged cocktails and meals to the room daily. Checking our bill helped to monitor our spending without having to worry about or remember what we drank at midnight or ate by the pool. The tube rentals for the pool are $20 each! Just pick up some rafts at CVS or walgreens while you are out. The mandalay beach staff will still blow them up for you free of charge. Always get your taxi from THE HOTEL side. The lines are short and their staff there very helpful. If you've got a car, take the garage stairs not the elevator and it will put you out right in the front of THE HOTEL. If you take the elevator, you empty out at rumjungle. Which ain't so bad though at night. It's a sight. Speaking of sights, the whole suite is dimly lit. Which is nice and calming. But if you need good lighting for reading etc., get it done during the day! Enjoy all the Mandalay property has to offer. THE HOTEL is actually very close to the entrance to Mandalay Place and connections to Luxor. It's also right at the theater entrance for Mamma Mia and the House of Blues. (But don't eat there! It's awful!) The walk to the beach is not as long as in some properties I've been in. In fact, except for the Shark Reef, the mandalay bay property was quite easy to get around. Enjoy THE HOTEL.

All of the other ones we went into (Treasure Island, Ceasars, Bellagio, Venitian, Luxor, Mirage) we sooo crowded in both the lobby and the Casino. The only day that the Hotel was busy was a Friday late afternoon early evening - when people were coming in for the weekend. Plus, it was a boxing weekend and a lot of concerts were coming to the Hotel. My only GRIPE about the place is the pool. It is a roundtrip distance of 1.6 miles from the lobby of the Hotel. And you have to walk through the casino to get there. There is no short cut to the pool. Also, we happened to go at one of the hotest times on record and there are NO umbrellas at the pool. They get you to spend $200/day (and only after you reserve 1 week in advance, or wait until 11:00 the day of to see if there were any no shows) to rent a Cabana. The cabanas are nice because they have misters, ceiling fan, shade, lounge chairs, table & chairs and a small refrigerator filled with water and Pepsi products. Also at one of the pools - in the late afternoon, there is a reflection from the gold building into the pool - and if you're in the pool, the reflection will accelerate your burning - so be careful. I just don't understand that in a place where it averages 115 degrees, how they don't have umbrellas at the pools. Even if they charge you to rent them, they'd still make their money. But as far as the Hotel goes, it's very nice - very clean, elevators are fast and you don't spend a lot of time waiting - carpets are plush, towels are amazing, their bath produts are lovely, etc. I cannot rave enough about the Hotel. It was very nice - only gripe, like I said was the pool.", "Date": "July 20, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle", "Title": "\u201cMandalay Bay has a great pool!\u201d", "Author": "Nikkos", "ReviewID": "UR3685510", "Content": "July 2005 - Mandalay Bay has a great pool area. We were there over the 4th of July weekend and even on a holiday there was plenty of room to swim in the pools, play in the wave pool or ride around the lazy river. I would say the pool areas are the main attraction and thing that sets Mandalay Bay apart from the other resorts. Although it is at the end of the strip, we did not find that to be a problem since there is a free monorail that takes you Excalibur, then you can walk across to the NY NY and take another free monorail on down to Bellagio which puts you right in the middle of the strip. Problems: The Mandalay Bay will \"nickle and dime\" you to death! There was no refrigerator in the room and it was $20/night to get one. Using their exercize facility was also extra at $27/day! If you want to ride an intertube around the lazy river (and you will) they rent for $10/day!! Absolutely everything is extra and of course the food and drinks are very expensive, but that is to be expected in a five star hotel. What I did not expect was the number of children and poorly behaved guests. I thought a five star resort would have a quieter clientele - expect to run into the same rowdy twenty-something crowd you would at a lesser hotel. Money savings suggestions: drop by the store and buy one of those styrofoam coolers for your room.

We didn't plan to stay at TheHotel but we got a great vacation plan through our Costco membership and decided to go for it! We planned for 6 nights because we figured it would take a few days to find housing. Luckily we found a house on day one, so we got to enjoy the area more than we'd expected to. We didn't have too bad a time finding TheParkinglot. We did not valet during our first night, though, and boy did we regret it. It was two thousand degrees in the garage and we were a long distance from the entrance. Once in TheBuilding we took TheElevator up to TheLobby and absolutely loved what we saw- very clean and spacious, with shiny floors and a minimalist design we loved. Check in was easy and swift- we just showed our I.D.s. We were asked if we wanted to put any money on our credit card so that we could order room service, internet access, etc. and just charge it to the card. We said no, because we didn't realize at the time that you can't charge anything to your room without putting money on the card FIRST. Maybe it was the way she explained it to us, and the fact that we aren't used to traveling. I did put $50 on the card because I specifically asked about internet access, knowing I'd need internet during the entire stay (I'm still finishing my MA paper). Ethernet is about 11.99 per 24-hour period. Lastly, We were upgraded to a corner suite for free when we requested it. Our room was on the 29th floor. Once we figured out which set of elevators to use, finding the room was easy. There are only two wings. The ice machine is in one wing, our corner suite was at the end of the other wing. The halls were nice and clean. We chose non-smoking, so no smoky odors to deal with. The room was great- exactly like the pictures you see online. In fact, I regretted seeing the pictures because I didn't get to feel that excitement I wanted to feel upon entering our room at such an expensive hotel. The problems we encountered on day one: 1) Only one of the two large plasma TVs worked. Turned out one of the remote controls had dead batteries. We called for assistance and someone brought us two batteries. It would have been nice if they had brought us a whole remote, or offered to change the batteries themselves- I mean, for all the money we paid! But it was a small quibble for me. However, when I opened the remote and found the battery acid had caked over the batteryies and some of the plastic, I felt a tad resentful. The TV in the bedroom was crappy- the picture wasn't clear on most of the channels. We never watched that TV during our entire stay. The TV in the sitting room was fine. I watched it one night when I'd had enough studying. I can't say that the TV was all that impressive, but maybe I'm just not one of those people who are excited about 42\" or 50\" plasma TVs. I liked it, but I didn't try to watch it everyday. Since I had to study, I immediately tried to get online at the little office desk. It's a nice work area that includes a fax machine that took up more space than I would've liked. They provide the ethernet cable in a black plastic-encased spool. You pull it out and a tension spring allows it to snap back. I wonder how long before the cable needs to be replaced from the tension it exterted? To use internet, you have to turn on the TV (so thank goodness for the TV that had a good picture!) and use the menu to reach a screen that gives you a four-digit code. I'd pre-paid for internet, so I got my code. (During my last day I could not get a code because the money had run out, but a call to the front desk fixed that problem, as they just billed my card). Internet access was EXCELLENT. The fastest I've ever experienced anywhere, even at my job at an internet service provider. It was ridiculous, it was so fast! That was almost my favorite part of my stay (I'm an internet fiend!). More about the room- two bathrooms, one with a nice-sized tub, separate glassed-in shower, a small plasma TV (wouldn't you know- it didn't work!), double sinks, a mirrored shelf next to each sink, a scale (got on it every day) and a toilet in a separate little room that had a phone in it. I don't know about using a phone when you're on the toilet- all I know is I didn't touch it! The bedroom has a wardrobe with a digital safe in it, ironing board with an attached iron (that was a funny discovery), and nice wooden hangers. We had a king-sized bed that was rather lumpily made. The view from each room was FANTASTIC. The sitting room has a separate bathroom with just a sink, mirror and toilet. Everything was dust-free and shiny. That night we went to the dinner buffet at Mandalay Bay. We really loved it, but it was so pricey, at almost $23 per person. If we had eaten more it would have been worth it. We tried our best! The food was fresh, very pretty and plentiful. They had these small carrots (not quite baby carrots) that were so fresh and shiny that I ate them just for their looks, and I'm no vegetable eater. We tried crab legs, lobster, tiny quiches, shrimp, oysters- all the things we normally don't eat. They also have regular fare such as different cuts of meat, mashed potatoes with gravy, smoked salmon, cheeses, breads, green beans, fried chicken, friend shrimp, etc. For some reason, their iced tea was the best iced tea I'd ever had. Maybe it's because it was so darned hot that I got dehydrated or something. Our waiter was awesome, kept the teas coming and cleared the old plates with the swiftness. Mandalay's brunch staff were much better than the other brunches we visited. We didn't like the desserts at Mandalay very much, but many people loved them. They have quite a few choices- little cake slices, brownies, cookies, and more. My partner in crime had gastric bypass surgery so she was hoping to enjoy the sugar-free desserts- she thought they were pretty bad, though. There is so much waste at buffets, it is sickening. We wasted a lot of food that day, so we were more careful during our breakfast and lunch visits. Breakfast was nothing to write home about. In fact, my partner was a little miffed because the \"chef\" fixing her crepe was too busy gabbing with another chef to pay attention to her request for blueberries. She said it loudly three times and he basically ignored her. She had to make him open the crepe back up to put blueberries in it, which kinda ruined the experience. Both chefs laughingly blamed the other for his mistake. Glad they found it amusing. Lunch was all right. I guess because we had the dinner buffet first, everything else paled in comparison. The following day I called to have the batteries for the bathroom TV remote changed. It took longer this time to get them, and they turned out to be the wrong size. The remotes use AA batteries, people, not AAA! I didn't bother with the remote after that, but my partner took a luxurious bath and enjoyed the TV after feeling for the controls on top. The lighting in the rooms took a bit getting used to- so many switches and dimmers, but once we figured out what affected what, it was great setting different moods. I loved my little office space and the lighting around it. I locked my laptop in the safe when I wasn't in the room and never had a problem with theft (which some people in other reviews have mentioned). We used the valet every day after that first night, and it was fine. Valet is free at all the hotels, I believe. We tipped the valets each time, of course. Sometimes we had to wait over 5 minutes for the car to arrive, which in a thousand-degree garage isn't all that fun, but we actually acclimated to the Las Vegas climate quickly. The low humidity made it bearable. I guess the garage was about 10 degrees hotter than outside sometimes, but if you stand verrry still..... Because I spent so much time studying, I didn't do a whole lot outside of the room as my partner did. I can say that room service was fine, although overpriced. It is 24 hours a day and seems to serve the food from the 24-hour cafe \"Raffles\". They had too few food choices, in my opinion, but the sandwiches I ordered were good. The couch in the sitting room is not luxurious but it served its purpose for TV-watching and eating. Housekeeping was not very thorough at all, but acceptable. My partner broke an elastic hairband in the bathroom and every day afterwards we still found beads. We tipped our housekeeper $5 a day. The first day that we tipped her we found a whole slew of nice bathroom products at the next housekeeping visit! We thought, wow- wonder what we'll get after tomorrow's tip! But it was never as good as the first time. :-) The toiletries are all prettily packaged and enjoyable. The white linens were all clean, thick and absorbent. The A/C was great in the sitting room (it was actually too cold at night) but setting the A/C in the bedroom didn't have the same effect and we often ended up tossing all the covers off us before the night was over because it was too warm for us. Hall noise was minimal, but on Saturday night I could hear a lot of noise from the clubs outdoors. I could hear the lyrics to every song very clearly 29 floors up. I love a vibrant city so it was kinda nice, but made me want to go out and play instead of study! We visited the casino briefly, went to the House of Blues gospel brunch (fun but NOT WORTH THE MONEY), walked through the shops at Mandalay Bay and visited the attached hotels. The brunches at Phoenix (Luxor) and at the Paris hotel did not compare in any way to the wonders of Mandalay Bay's buffet. In fact, we didn't like the Paris brunch in any way, shape or form. Even the clothes they make those poor waitresses wear were bad. All in all our stay was excellent and I would definitely stay there again. I would just first make sure to check all the remote controls and the A/C, and put a few hundred on a card so I could charge room service, internet and the buffets to our room. Oh- and I'd be prepared with comfortable walking shoes, sunglasses and sleeveless shirts! I'm now officially too spoiled to ever want a regular hotel room again. -ADP", "Date": "July 18, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "new york, new york", "Title": "\u201cGorgeous corner suite views, worst service ever\u201d", "Author": "nycjetset", "ReviewID": "UR3669012", "Content": "I had stayed at The Hotel a year ago with a friend and had a fabulous time.

When we checked in on Thursday afternoon, they told us there were no strip view rooms available when we checked in, and then 5 min later as we were finishing our paperwork, we heard the couple next to us receive a strip view. But that was nothing compared to the nightmare that followed. We were led to our room which was dark and absolutely filthy. There was literally crap in both toilets, stains and glass on the floor and no sheets on the bed. We had dinner reservations at Mix in 2 hours so we were a little anxious. However, the front desk advised us that the room would be made up as soon as possible so we went downstairs to get a drink. An hour later we returned to a disgusting room. So we called the front desk again and were told that there were no clean rooms available. After asking for a manager, we finally got a new room. So, back downstairs to get a key. Another 20 minutes to get a bellhop because they wouldn't let us move our own lugguge. And the new room was ... disgusting again. But no crap in the toilet at least. By this time we had been in Vegas for 2 hours and were about to miss our reservation. The bellhop was very nice and offered to run downstairs, get a new set of keys, and also check the next room to make sure it truly was clean. So after another half an hour, we were settled in a clean, but dark room. Right next to the elevators and housekeeping room. And the manager offered to put us in a strip view room first hting next morning before our spa treatments. And they made new reservations for us. The fun doesn't end here. Not surprisingly, we were not able to move into a room before our spa treatments at 11am even though i called at 8am (east coast jet lag). Front desk promised we'd be taken care of by 2pm at the latest. So we went to the spa where the staff was absolutely lovely. When they heard us mention our exhausting check-in process, the manager there offered to guarantee us a room. She called front desk where they guaranteed her that we would receive not only a room upgrade, but a fruit basket and of course a new room by 2pm. After lunch, we returned to a freshly made room. So we assumed that our new room would have been made up as well. But of course ... we had no new room to move. Front desk and manager promised us a new room by 5pm or 7pm that evening. So we kept calling to get a manager. Finally, 2 hours later we were moved into a very very nice high floor, large corner suite. No fruit basket of course! But by then we were exhausted ...

My husband is a shower person and the separate shower stall was a nice touch. Some people may think that the hotel is situated too far south of the strip, but we got around no problem.

It was so relaxing and ultra romantic. Don't listen to others when they say it's a long walk to the Mandalay Bay casino. This is ridiculous. I timed it at 2 minutes walking normal. The decor along the way makes the distance even shorter. Having access to all the amenities at Mandalay Bay makes you appreciate this hotel more. I did not go to the restaurant/club called the \"Mix.\" Just too much going on. However, I did eat at the \"Cafe\" twice. It was over priced but good. Service was excellent. Also, they are open 24 hours. This was really convenient after a late show and late gambling. Like other reviews, all pool areas in Mandalay Bay were packed. However, I found one of the pools towards the back more private, a few people and nice. Most of the people are near the wave pool or adjacent to it. If you go early you don't have a problem. Regardless, you could still enjoy the water. It was fun and everybody was friendly. I recommend the \"House of Blues\" located in Mandalay Bay for a concert (We saw 2) but get tickets for the floor and standing area. This is by far the best seat in the house. Stand in the upper bar area and you have a can't miss view. Very nice and close. All the upper level seats are poor viewing to me. They have an annoying safety bar in the way and it takes one person to stand up and your view is gone. There are two mentionable negatives. 1. The distance from the hotel from the center of the strip. Get to know the trams and how they connect to other hotels. They can help you a little but expect a lot of walking. Be sure to bring comfortable shoes. I had a rental car so travel was easy but parking was not. Parking meant even more walking. I would still recommend a rental car for at least one day. 2.

We arrived and we liked the decor of the lobby. Check in line was not bad at all. We took the chance and arrived at noon hoping to get an early check in. During check in, we were allowed to check in early, and we were offered a downgrade to a deluxe room instead of a suite. So THE Hotel is NOT all suites, they do have a limited number of deluxe rooms, which is your basic room with the THE Hotel decor. They told us that the suites were oversold and were offereing people downgrades. We saved almost 100 dollars a night, so we took it. Had a room on the 21st floor. It was nice because that set of elevators only went from lobby level to floor 23. When getting an elevator, they were always empty when we got it. Service Issue: So we get to the room and open the door, and it was not cleaned yet. It was pretty gross in that it looks like there was some major partying going on in there. There was a maid across the hall in the other room so we asked her about when it might be cleaned. She said it wasn't her room and said she was sure it would be cleaned later. About 5 minutes later, a housekeeping supervisor came by, and since we were changing to go to the pool, we asked her to come back in 5 minutes. Upon leaving, I called housekeeping, and had them note that we were new guests and wanted everything changed. We left for lunch, came back 3 hours later and the maid just started cleaning it. Slow, in service, but good timing in that i confirmed that she would do the new guest cleaning. Now as for the front desk staff, at check in, the rep changed the rate for the first night in the computer. Then she hand wrote the second nights rate on the form i signed. She said she would change it right away in the system. I knew she wouldn't. So sunday morning, I checked via the TV and had to go downstairs to get them to change the rate. The first rep didn't know how to change it, so she asked another person. The other man goes, \"i'll take your word for it and make the correction\". PLEASE, don't take my word and look it up on the paper! Anyway, the rate was changed. Hotel: As for the hotel itself. Its very nice and clean. They did not check keys to get in, so anyone can get into the rooms. Our next door neighbors had some adult entertainment in the room at 2AM. Like how they had a coffee bar right downstairs. Also its nice that there isn't a casino in the lobby. The distance between THE Hotel and Mandalay was closer than I thought. Didn't think it was that bad. It is closer to Mandalay Place, which makes it a quick walk into Luxor and Excaliber (all indoor walkways). Pool: Basically Mandalay Bay's Pool. Chairs were at a premium. We had to go when they opened at 9AM to get chairs. By 9:45, all the chairs were taken already. Just too bad this hotel doesn't have a dedicated pool like the Four Season's does at Mandalay. There is a policy now that everyone, regardless of age, must present a key to get into the pool area. So if you had a 1 year old, they have to have a key. I guess its one way of regulating that the number of people paying to stay in the room is the actual number staying there. You not only show the key, they test it to make sure it is active.

Excellent bath stuff, too, and the maids were generous about giving us extras. I thought the bed was extremely comfortable (and I'm really picky about that). We had to return home two days earlier than we'd planned, and the staff was great about that too. The restaurants and bars at Mandalay Bay were great. I would highly recommend Fleur de Lys, especially to vegetarians looking for a great meal-- the 5-course menu is delicious. They even sent over a special extra dessert for us because we were celebrating our anniversary and sent us on our way to Mystere with a little gold box of candies. The Mandalay Bay pool complex is very nice... I wish we'd had better weather, but I'm sure anyone who's there when it's hot and sunny would love it. The spa at TheHotel is terrific. I had an honeydew exfoliating treatment that was one of the best spa treatments I've ever had. It was pricey, even by Boston and NYC prices, but it was worth it. The amenities available to anyone getting a treatment at the spa are great extras-- hot and cool plunge pools, sauna, steam room, and all sorts of hair products. The aesthetician even gave me a little cup of the honeydew lotion to take with me back to the room.

The one glitch we had involved housekeeping skipping our room on the final day, but I think that's more to do with our having to rush to change plans than with their negligence (we asked them to come back later but then were still making phone calls at that time and still had the do not disturb light on).

If you prefer sophisticated upscale decor and don't want to stay in one of the kitsch theme park style hotels now abundant in Las Vegas, this is the place for you. The vibe here is definitely aiming for a younger adult clientel with a taste for a modern design atmosphere. We had a standard suite on the 37th Floor with a view of The Strip. I found the darker toned rooms to be very restful and had no issues with the lighting mentioned in some of the other reviews. Check-in was a breeze, no wait, no attitude, and even though we arrived three hours before check-in time the desk clerk gave us our room keys and let us put our luggage in the room with the understanding that the maid was preparing the room and would prefer that we come back after she was finished. The desk clerk also gave us a complimentary late check out at 1:00 p.m. instead of the standard 11:00 a.m. since we were departing on a Monday. We also had a great room service breakfast that we pre-booked the night before, which was delivered right on time. The Mandalay Bay pool area was fantastic, especially the Lazy River, although it is a little far from TheHotel to be convenient to returning to your room if you forget something you need at the pool. There are also quieter areas to lounge in away from the crowded and noisy beach scene. Service at the pool area we were in was very good. Can't wait to go back, and that is coming from someone who does not gamble and has never really cared that much for Las Vegas. If you are really into gambling and want to be in the center of the action, this is probably not the place for you due to its location at the end of The Strip.

This property is simply the best there is in Vegas. We have stayed at some very busy times (Halloween, July 4, New Years) and each time the service and rooms are impecable. The decor is very sleek, elegant, and smoothing... lots of marble, mahogony and other dark woods. The bathrooms are a good size and very trendy (reminded me of MTV cribs in a way), honestly I would love to have the designers make my apartment look like any room there. The pool/beach is incredible. I would rank it #1 overall and #2 in terms of catering to 20-somethings (the Hard Rock's eye candy is hard to beat but Mandalay does a nice job). As far as food we ate at the buffet and (like the majority of Hotel buffets) it was great, particularly great at THEhotel was the fruit - the freshest I have ever had (is it possible that the pineapple tasted better than in Hawaii?). I also ordered a salad from room service, it was very good - again you could tell they used the freshest ingredients. The outdoor cafe by the pool was good, the wait was a little long but we did try to eat right at 12:30. The Banana daquri was good but pretty weak. The menu isnt too extravegant but the service was good and friendly. Rumjungle, the Mandalay's club, was ok but it doesn't really compare to the other lounges/clubs around... If you like the service and style of THEhotel try the lounge at the TI called Tangerine... it opened on July 4th weekend and it is amazing - I wish THEhotel would have something like that (although then maybe I would never leave). Finally, the lobby/check-in staff was very very nice. I'm sure its in their database but they greated us by first name and mentioned our last stay with them (made me feel like a high-roller,which I deffinitly am not). And one very nice surprise (I'm still not sure why this happened) but on the last day there I received a very nice mandalay bay/Nike golf/gym bag full off goodies - including golf gloves, balls, a vest, two baseball hats, golf shoe carrier, a personalize thank you card with the cards of the concierge.

When we arrived at THE hotel I was immediately impressed with the elegance of the lobby. At check-in, we requested a strip view room and were told that none were available and they gave us a \"pool view\" room. We arrived in our room to discover that a pool view was actually a view of the highway on the right and a slight view of the pool on the left. I then went and checked out the room and noticed that there was a stain on the bedspread (looked like blood). I immediately called housekeeping and they sent someone up. She asked me if I wanted to have a look at the sheets also and we both noticed that those were dirty as well. She went ahead and changed both. After that fiasco, we had a pretty good night's sleep in the room and it was fairly quiet. The only thing that we noticed is that if you are in the sitting room, there is a constant windy noise if your room is located close to the elevator. The next day we called down and asked if a strip view room was available and they told us that one would be available later in the afternoon after the guest checked out. We packed up our stuff and asked if someone could move our stuff when the room became available (since we would be out). They said they are not allowed to do that (I've never heard that before). So, around 4pm we were able to move to our new room on the 33rd floor. The first thing I noticed was scratches on the walls. Also, it turned out that a \"strip view\" in this case was literally a view of the strip (the street). If we crained our heads we could see part of Luxor and the beginning parts of the strip on the left. Despite this, we decided to give the room a chance. The first night in this room we both woke up around 3am because of the noise and music coming from Mix on the top floor. We ended up having to turn on the fan from the air conditioner (which blows really cold air) to drown out the noise. Not a great option when you have a cold. We ended up having to do this every night because of the noise. THE hotel and its rooms are really beautifully decorated and the connection with Mandalay Bay is great for the casino, restaurants and pool area (the pool area is one of the best of I've seen). However, I think the quality of the rooms on the strip side is poor because of the noise and also the quality of the rooms in general isn't as a great as I would expect from a hotel that is only one year old (i.e. scratches on the walls, stains on the bedspread).", "Date": "April 22, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "uk", "Title": "\u201cLuxury!\u201d", "Author": "love2holiday", "ReviewID": "UR3398350", "Content": "Book this hotel if you can get a good deal.

A girlfriend and I and our three teeanage daughters were staying for two nights to get some fun in the sun and some last minute school shopping done. We made a reservation for 2 suites, connecting....double double (meaning two double beds in each suite). I was first told that this bed configuration was definitely available, then was told it was a request only and then when we checked in was told it never even existed...that the connecting rooms have a king bed connecting to a suite with two doubles only. So, I had to share with my girlfriend and the bed was not comfortable as other trip advisor reviews suggested. Try the Four Seasons for a decent bed in Las Vegas. I ended up sleeping on the couch the second night. When we got to The Hotel and had the bed configuration hassles...it took about 40 nminutes in line and then another 15 for them to figure the suite configuration out. We got to our suites and they smelled like mold...I took off my shoes and found that the carpet was soaking wet...not just in spots, all over. The evidently had cleaned the carpets and forgot to take our room off the list until it dried in a few days. When we tried to change rooms they told us that we could but we wouldn't connect to our daughters....so we had to live with it. They said they would bring in fans, but they never showed up. The bathrooms are very nice (nothing truely spectacular like the Penthouses at the Bellagio or anything), but nice. They were very dirty though...they have glass shelves on both sides of the vaniites and they were so dirty (almost like construction dust)...we only had one robe per room even thought we paid for 5 total people to be in our two suites. We called to get robes...they showed up the next day. We had to wear slippers the entire time because the carpets never dried at all....the rooms were changed and \"cleaned\" except for that thick dirt and dust on the bathroom shelves. We finally said something about it to housekeeping when we finally got our robes and they said they'd get someone to reclean our room while we were out at a show for the evening. When we returned the rooms had been tidied, but the dirt we were talking about was still there...even after physically taking the supervisor into the both bathrooms to show her. Later that night we found that there was a baby sock (not ours) in the sheet on the bed in the girls room and I found a baby toy (not ours) in the drapery when we pulled them back to see the view one night.... On our last day I was expecting a fax and we were having problems with the fax machine in our suite....we had to call the front desk and they were not sure how to use the machine...they referred me to the tech dept. and they told me how to use the machine but after a long dissertation, it was completely the opposite of how to use it....I waited for faxes that never came but were sent from my office at home.....turns out that the machine was out of toner....they told me that someone would be up immediately to fix it...they didn't show for hours. We ended up having to call 4 times and no one ever showed. We checked out and never got the faxes at all. The girls finally decided to write \"wash me\" in the dust on the bathroom shelves... I wonder if its still there???? I was asked by the front desk manager how our stay was and told her about the problems. She called me a few days later, which I was very impressed with and she asked me to try them again and she would be sure to take care of us. She left me her direct line and said to ask for her when making my next reservation and she would make it up to us. So, almost 9 months later, we are trying it again. We are going for my girlfriends 40th birthday. So, I called the desk manager and she said that she could get us the internet rate...of $399.00 per night, per room. What I am wondering is, exactly what it is she is doing to make the last experience up to us....she took 5 days to call me back and acted like it was an imposition for me to call her direct.

I certainly did, and I can tell you after reading such great reviews about this place, I had high expectations. We stayed for 3 nights in late March to celebrate my wife's 40th, so I was looking forward to pampering her for a few days at what seemed like a \"sure thing\". The room did not disappoint - everything written about the quality of the suites at THEhotel is dead-on. In fact, when I walked into my room for the first time, I felt it was exactly as I had imagined based on the write-ups. The decor is definitely very sleek and cool, and the lighting is quite subdued, but it is really a pleasure to come back to a quiet 'low-key' environment after the sensory overload of hours out on the strip (although some may disagree). My wife and I had no greater pleasure than getting back to our room after walking the strip all day, and sliding into the luxuriously oversized tub and decompressing while taking in some entertainment on the wall-mounted bathroom plasma screen (ok - so maybe there were some greater pleasures, but this isn't the forum for that!). Everything else about the room was top-notch and as advertised. Where we were quite disappointed though, was with the staff and their generally plastic and indifferent attitude. Let me start off by saying, we are not whiners who enjoy trying to find something to complain about all the time. We do however expect a reasonable level of service and courtesy when checking into a hotel of this stature. The entire time of our stay at THEhotel, we did not feel that anyone went out of their way to make us feel welcome or wanted. No, we aren't high rollers, so I don't expect the royal treatment, but I believe all guests at such a hotel and at such rates should be made to feel welcome and valued. Honestly, all of the positives of this hotel went right out the window just about any time we asked for anything. A few examples: At check-in, our room was apparently being made up at the time, so we were told it would be about 45 minutes until we could use the room (this was at about 2pm). We were told that a bellman would come and meet us to check our bags so we could relax. After 20 minutes of waiting beside the desk in plain view of the clerk that served us, and being turned down by the only bellman we ever saw come by (he apparently had more important things to do than check our bags), we decided to just give up and took our bags up to the room. When we got up to the room, it was evident that the room had been ready all along, as there wasn't a cleaning cart anywhere on the floor. The clerk just assumed that it was too early and never actually confirmed it wasn't ready. By the way, when we walked into the room, the first thing we saw was a beautiful bowl filled to the brim with cherries (my wife's favorite). What a nice welcoming touch! Forget about it, they're FAKE! On our second day, we came back to the room to discover that instead of two terry robes, we now only had one. Don't ask me why they would take a robe out of our room, but they did. After 3 calls to the desk to get the robe replaced we gave up, and shared the one robe the rest of our stay. We were certainly comforted by the desk clerk who told us not to worry, she made a note that we didn't steal it. Gee, thanks! Similarily, 3 calls to the front desk to get a burnt out lightbulb replaced in the bathroom resulted in more empty promises. It's ok, we just shared the one well-lit sink the entire time, while the other sat unused in shadows. We had a red-eye flight leaving at 11pm, so we politely requested a later checkout. We were told that the hotel was fully booked, and our room was needed by 1pm. Now, I can understand a busy hotel needing to check people in, and certainly they don't have to let us stay later than policy dictates. But if all the rooms were indeed booked, why after the clerk consulted a manager were they able to offer a 6pm checkout if we wanted to pay for an extra night? Obviously there were empty rooms available (as many guests certainly request a late check-in), but they are only available for a price. After we courteously declined such an enticing offer, we got the consolation offer. \"If you would like to pay $22 each, you can go take a shower in the spa\". Thanks again! Anyhow, that should give you an idea of some of the prevailing attitude at THEhotel. Not once were we confrontational with anyone - we just politely asked and observed in stunned silence. None of the above incidents were traumatic, but they definitely left us with a bad taste for what is otherwise an outstanding hotel.", "Date": "April 15, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bismarck", "Title": "\u201cMixed feelings\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3356154", "Content": "We stayed at The Hotel for four nights during March - our first time there. There were alot of things I loved about the place, but alot of things I didn't care for. No doubt the room is sensational- the bath products were to die for and my husband was in heaven having ESPN on in three rooms at once. The bed was so comfortable I wanted to take it home with me. That said, we did not like the layout of the place. The lobby/hallways are dark and forbidding - we did not eat at The Cafe - it was not inviting and is out in the open for everyone walking by to look at you. It is also a long way from the other restuarants...plan on walking alot. Speaking of walking, be aware that if you want to wander down the strip you will be walking forever as it is situated so far from everything. Luckily the tram was working fine and that helped alot. The third day we were there we went downstairs to play in a poker tournament - when we came back we found our safe open and $200 missing. Filed a report with security....$200 was not going to make or break us but when you feel you have done everything to secure your property the first thing you do is report what happened. To make a long story short we should have saved ourselves the hassle as the management didn't seem to care. Despite the fact that they can verify both my husband and I were out of the room (security cameras in the casino show we were in the poker tournament when their own records show the safe was somehow opened)...it's not their problem. No apology, no explanation. I did not expect to ever see the $200 again, but when the management simply disreqards you that doesn't say much. So, despite the nice bed and three TV etc...we will not go back.

I could see the hotel when I landed at the airport ( I never knew the airport would be that close to the strip) We took the shutle to the hotel which cost 5.00 each. We were the third stop so I would say the whole ride took about 12-15 minutes. W When we arrived we were greeted by the friendly woman behind the desk. I did politely ask for a high room and we got the 19th floor which was good, however, I forgot to ask for a strip view, so we got a room that faced Hwy 15(I think ) and I nice backdrop of the mountains,but it was still OK. We arried around 1:15 p.m. and they let us check in without any problems The room: Fabulous. Very clean, yes the decor is dark and contemporary, so if you do like bright colors then this hotel is not for you. Since I love dark decor I fell in love instantly. The bed is just out of this world, very comparable or better than the Westin Heavenly Beds. The two bathrooms really helped and the multiple plasma televisions, as my travelling companion and I often watched different programming. Overall the room was very relaxing (if you can be relaxed in Vegas) and I would almost certainaly stay here the next time I go. The Location: I like the location, yes its at the southern most end of the strip, but that's Ok, I kind of liked being away from everything, plus everything we needed was at the neighboring Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino, so we did not feel we missed out on a lot. This is another thing, from some of the previous reviews, I thoughht I would have to walk outside to get to the Mandaly Casino, but you don't have to at all. There is a connecting walkway on the ground level between the lobby of t THe Hotell and the theatre area of Mandalay Bay, the whole walk takes about 1-2 minutes. The only reasons you can even tell that you are leaving The Hotel and going to Mandalay, is that the decor of The Hotel is so different than anything you have probably seen in Vegas. It has a very chic and sophisticated type appeal that is almost very New York City. I did get to go downtown to do some shopping. First we took a cab to Freemont Street, which cost about $20.00 on the way back we took the bus for $1.25 each(much better deal and we got to see more of the strip this way since the cab took the highway). Once I saw the rest of the strip I was even more happy that I chose The hotel. Even though we went on Sunday, the strip was packed with people, and some of the other hotels were just so gigantic looking, that I am sure I would have gotten lost in them. But then again I'm kind of a laid back person so the temperment of The Hotel was just right. Gambling/Casino: THe casino area was nice. Some of the slots that I favor in Atlantic City casinos were missing though. However, the servers were quite generous with drinks. I was able to order basic drinks such as rum & coke to more elaborate like pina coladas, without having to pay (only tip the server). Payouts were pretty reasonable, I did not win millions, but I honestly did not lose any money, which I always so in Atlantic city. There were very little lines and I was able to redeem my slot payoyuts within 3 minutes or less. Great atmosphere, and I like that the casino did not seem smoke-filled like some of the others. Definitely sign up for the players card as the points rack up rather quickly, plus you can use the card at several other casinos. Staff: Always friendly and courteous. Housekeeping staff gave us whatever we needed. I tipped one of the food servers when I got take out, and he made sure to give me lots of extra pastries, utensils, condiments etc. On a related point, found the taxi drivers, andbus, shuttle drivers very friendly and accomodating. No problems. Food: Recommendation would be to bring or pick up some sodas, juce etc. The drinks, sandwiches in The hotel were kind of pricey. We ended up having most ly sandwiches and desserts from the coffee bar in the lobby. On our last night we had take-out from Raffles Cafe in Mandalay It was basic American fare and very reasonable when compared to what I am used to paying in Washington D.C. The other restaraunts seemed full, but I never saw massive wait lines or heard about any problems. There are so many places to eat in the complex alone that I can't imagine anyone feeling like they could not find something they liked. Overall this was a great stay. I am still in awe by the whole experience. I highly recommend the hotel.

Last time, I stayed at the Bellagio, which was an excellent choice. THE Hotel is comparable with Bellagio; both are very classy with THE Hotel being \"modern\" and the Bellagio \"classical\". The other difference is location: the Bellagio is perfectly situated in the middle of the strip, whereas THE Hotel is at the very beginning. This means that you'll have to walk-walk-walk, and don't have yourself fooled by the tram connecting THE Hotel/Mandalay Bay with the Luxor etc., nor think that the Monorail is an efficient transport system. On the other hand, the location makes THE Hotel an excellent choice for people wanting to spot celebrities, who seem to like its \"distant\" location. On THE hotel itself: another strong point is, it doesn't feel like your typical Las Vegas hotel. So check in to THE Hotel and enjoy every day another of the typical resorts like Circus Circus, Luxor, Caesars Palace, The Venetian, New York New York, Paris Vegas, Excalibur etc. just by visiting their lobbies, shopping centra etc. THE Hotel is a small hotel with regard to Las Vegas standards (only 1000 rooms) and offers only suites. The suites are remarkle: large and modern with only top amenities: a perfect bed, LDC TV's all around, a cozy separate salon to relax, a giant bath, upscale bathroom amenities from Gilchrist & Soames of the UK. Rooms are also very quiet. The only negative point: stay away from THE Cafe for your breakfast or whatever. We tried it 3 times (just to make sure) and every time again: very unattentive and unfriendly staff offering the slowest service I've had the past years. (and moreover, it's the typical \"this is not included, that is not included\" Cafe). THE Hotel shares everything with its parent hotel Mandalay Bay. Things to check out there: the private beach club Moorea Beach (offering a South Beach feeling in las Vegas), check the sand beach (!) at the wave pool, visit the Shark Reef and explore one of the fine, upscale restaurants. The Mix, Alain Ducasse's latest venture in Las Vegas is literally the top; everybody wants to get in (and as a hotel guest, you can), it's on the 64th floor and the pricing is top as well... The only restaurant facility you DON'T want to check out is the buffett of Mandalay Bay; it offers inferior meals in a highly uninspiring atmosphere. To conclude: THE Hotel is a safe and excellent choice in Las Vegas; with pricing from appx. 150 USD (week-days) up to 400 USD (week-ends) per room.

The view was amazing. I highly recommend dining in The Cafe located in the lobby for any meal - it is also stylish with a great menu and decent pricing for Vegas. The hotel thought of everything, robes, slippers, blow dryers, iron and ironing boards, toiletries, etc...even the hallways were beautiful (carpeting, artwork, lighting) The best part about the hotel is that you are in Vegas, but you don't feel like you are in Vegas. The hotel is quiet and is very chic. Even the bathrooms in the lobby area are beautiful. The lobby also has a great coffe bar and lounge area. I only had one complaint and that was our dinner at Mix at the top of the hotel - the space is amazing the veiw incredible, but the dining experience was a miss - the food is way to expensive for what it is and the service started out great and then was just awful - not to mention a waiter lost his footing coming down the stairs with a tray of food and the entire tray fell over the railing landing on the table below, but thankfully no one was hurt. What designer would have a wait staff have to use a staircase everytime they have get and deliver food (dumb idea). I would recommend instead a drink in the Mix Lounge for great views (same as restaurant) or maybe just expensive deserts at the restaurant.

I have to say, it lived up to my lofty expecatations I took from reading reviews here. There are very few, if any, negative things I have to say about it. Although my wife and I aren't the hardest to please and were joking around about some of the things I am sure some people around here would have been upset by. We arrived on Saturday around 5:00 PM or so, no line to check in, walked right up and was finished checking in just a few minutes. Asked for a room high up with a view of the strip and got a room on the 33rd floor with a wonderful strip view. Anything we needed was taken care of rather quickly. The only thing that took any time was getting a new hair dryer, but I think this may have been my fault, listening for a knock instead of a doorbell and didn't realize what the sound was at first. The room was awesome with a surprisingly comfy couch. The plasma TV was nice to watch a little of the basketball on. The tub fit 2 very easily and was a very nice little hangover cure in the morning. The bed was very comfortably, although I was only passing out in it. Ate dinner one night at THE cafe, food was excellent, but the service less than stellar, although I think we just had a bad waiter. Other tables seemed to have much better sevice, and we were eating at 9:30 at night. I would definitely recomend it, I think we just had a bad waiter on a bad night. We didn't go to Mix, we really only wanted to do one nice, expensive dinner and went to Delmonico's at the suggestion of my parents. Had one of the best steaks I have ever had there. Somehow my wife talked us into the Foundation Room Saturday night so we got to experience the view and drinking out on a blacony on the 60th floor. We ate at Raffle's cafe in Mandalay, very good food and very good service. Had some drinks at Red Square, this was very cool, especially with the top of the bar being ice. The pool was awesome, this being our first trip to Mandalay. My wife loves spending time at the pool so this was perfect for her. It did get a little crowded, the first day we were down there by 10:00 and had no problem finding a chair. The second day we got down closer to 11:00 and got lucky on finding 2 together. Then the third day, again got down around 11:00 and couldn't find anything. Although a convention was starting our last day there so things got a bit more crowded. I would recomend getting to the pool early if you want a chair. We really didn't mind staying down on the south end of the strip away from everyone else. You don't have all the walk through traffic, with the huge crowds just standing around or taking up all the tables like you have at places like Bellagio ro Caesar's. We always just took the tram from MB to Excalibur if we were going to walk up the strip. Overall, we had a great time in Vegas. As usual, not enough sleep and too much booze, but can't wait to go back. We would definitely stay the THE hotel again. We had the \"Calm after the Storm\" deal which made it significantly cheaper so that was definitely nice. We will probably try a few places mid strip the next couple times just to experience that part, but will definitely come back to THE hotel in the future after we have experienced all that.

We spent the last 11 days criss-crossing between Las Vegas, Palm Springs and LA, with stays at four different hotels in Las Vegas alone. (It was a busy trip!) So I have a real appreciation for what a hotel has to offer. We ran the gambit of hotel classes-- from budget (the Gold Coast which I adore) to mid-range (Flamingo which was good, but only due to the $65 rate booked well in advance for a midweek room) to four star (Caesar's Palace which is my choice for best all-around hotel) to luxury... which brings me to THEhotel. Coming back to THEhotel for a stay cemented for me that this is one fine hotel... anytime... anywhere. If I could stay here all the time I would. The rooms are plush, the beds are so comfortable. The bathrooms are exceptional. I could go on. Okay, I will! The rooms have every amenity. From robes and slippers to the best spa quality bath products. Even if you are not a bathtub kinda person, you will want to sit in your tub and hang out. A plasma screen in just about every room... a CD/DVD player Every room in this hotel is a suite... and a big suite at that. 650 square feet of luxury. And you can feel away from it all, which can be almost impossible to say for some other strip hotels. If money were not an issue, or if you can secure a good online rate, I would tell anyone not to hesitate and treat themselves to a stay at THEhotel. Actually, our stay at THEhotel was $159 per night... while nights at the Flamingo were pricier for the same period. So do your homework and check back often on room rates.

The main thing about the hotel is its signature design love it or hate it, you'll have an opinion. I certainly have one that began to form when we exited our taxi. The main entry to THEhotel is via the bottom floor of Mandalay Bay's garage. No grand entry here. The lobby is, for lack of a better word, cavernous. In essence, the feeling of being underground that started in the garage is amplified in the lobby. While the ceilings are high, the decor is stark with very little natural light coming in. All the surfaces are made of polished granites, marbles, and other exotic materials that I'm sure are expensive. The artwork is Spartan the architecture does all the talking. When we checked in, our particular hostess was terse and spoke very quickly a robotronic young lady. I felt as if my wife and I were being made to assimilate. Nobody offered to help us with our bags. When we asked for a room with a westward view, Ms. Robotic nearly said attempts to move rooms are futile and that a western room would not be ready for hours. I had another plan - move into our south facing (garage) view room and call down to another host in the hope of finding one not yet devoid of a soul. Schlepping our few bags to the 32nd floor was difficult because there were no signs to the elevators. We found them after a few minutes of being rats in the maze. Fortunately for us we had cheese and the lobby area is small. The elevator bays are small and dark, further reinforcing the notion of being in a cave. The room itself was nice (more on the rooms in a minute) but for one disappointing detail. The living room had a beautiful bowl of Bing cherries, my favorites. But they were plastic. As were all the other plants in our room, except for the flowers presented during turndown service. Sigh. Calling down to the front desk, Morticia adroitly moved us into a room looking west, away from the Strip and facing the snow-capped mountains. Very pretty views! At Bellagio switching rooms was much easier. Their the front desk remotely re-keyed our electronic cards and a bellhop immediately materialized to take our bags. At THEhotel I had to go back to the front desk, avoiding Ms. Robotic's icy glaze, to get the keys re-programmed. Then we had to move our luggage ourselves. The two rooms we saw had the same lay-out: Suites with the living room and bedroom side-by-side. The living room contained its own half bath, the traditional sink and fridge loaded with pay-through-the-nose goodies. Very sparse lighting throughout except for the master bathroom. The living room also contains a massive plasma screen TV and DVD player. We were unaware of the DVD player when we made our reservations. Bring your own DVDs, my friends. THEhotel has none to share or rent to you. In fact, THEhotel has no concierge. The couch is comfortable but is not a sleeper. The living room also has a guide listing THEhotel's amenities and facilities. Forget ordering a newspaper from faraway places, though, such as Los Angeles, New York, Washington, or even Las Vegas. Instead, each morning that perky paper USA Today awaits you. Joy. The bedroom, as others have noted, has a wonderfully comfortable bed. The pillows did not feel like they were stuffed with feathers though housekeeping assured me otherwise. There's another huge TV. Onto the bathroom, it has a dark granite shower, sunken bath (no Jacuzzi!), yet another TV and separate wc, always appreciated. Each room has a thermostat. I don't know how much THEhotel cost - I imagine somewhere on the order of a billion dollars. Regardless of the size of the investment, its reliance on the amenities and facilities of Mandalay Bay is essential. THEhotel has one restaurant, THEcafe (that my wife and I named THECave), a coffee shop, a bar, a teeny-weeny VIP lounge (bourgeoisie need not apply) and a new $18 million restaurant / bar complex, THEmix, on the top floor that we didn't get to see. I want to take a moment to compare THEhotel with Mandalay Bay. While THEhotel's suites are larger than the rooms at Mandalay Bay, dollar for dollar, I strongly recommend Mandalay Bay over its darker sibling. Here's why: *Mandalay Bay is bright, open, cheerful. THEhotel is dark, even oppressive. *The Spa and Gym at THEhotel has no natural light at all. Maybe Zen aficionados and adherents appreciate these things more than I. But stainless steel sinks swiped from nearby air force bases are simply not attractive. The much larger Spa and Gym facilities of Mandalay Bay are brighter and warmer. At $30 per day, a few hours at the Mandalay Bay Spa is a bargain. I think THEhotel has slightly more exercise equipment than Mandalay Bay, and all the aerobic equipment has individual TVs (fine if that's your gig). But by any other gauge MB's facilities far surpass THEhotel's. Mandalay Bay has an infinitely larger selection of shops, restaurants and attractions, including the casino. Again, I understand that the powers who design these enormous hotels need to save money. And relying on the resources of Mandalay Bay is probably smart. But THEidentity of THEhotel is just stark, dark, and cloying. My wife answered the question of why did they design THEhotel so oppressively? Because they can. PS - At least someone at THEhotel has a sense of humor.

The service was outstanding - excellent front desk, valet and bell service. The hotel is beautiful - dark woods, marble and a quiet atmosphere. there is a coffee bar that serves Starbucks in the lobby. Wonderful art and ambience.

A separate room with the dumper even had its own phone. The double vanity counter was about 7 ft wide. There are built in shelves with all kinds of bath goodies that the wife loved. We tipped $5 every day to the housekeeper, and she would refill everything with 2 of each bottle. The bathtub was enormous, about 2.5 ft. deep and big enough for 2. The water comes out in a waterfall stream, very cool. The separate shower was marble in the back walls and glass on 2 sides. The top of it was open, so you could hear (and watch) the 15\" plasma TV while getting ready.

Although this was frustrating and invconvenient, it was reassuring to know that management took the necessary steps to ensure that the pool water was properly sanitized!", "Date": "December 23, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington, DC", "Title": "\u201cWow!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2919228", "Content": "I was VERY impressed!

WE stayed 7 nights and loved every minute of it. The room is spaciouis, consierge is helpful, and valet is nice if you choose to use it. We decided to park our own car, though, just to save some cash. Our room cost 250 dollars per night. We ate at THE Cafe a lot as well as the breakfast bar/lounge. The service at THE Cafe was not the best and the food is expensive...but what do you expect for a top notch hotel? WE only toured the spa, but it looked very nice. It was a nightmare trying to find a chair at the pool. There are actually several pools and I got lost trying to find a chair and make my way back to my husband at another pool. Also, when I was trying to find my way back, I ran into the ADULT pool which is clothing optional. It was funny when the lifegard at the gate asked me if I was sure I was here, because of course I had a clothing on (a bikini). We would definitely like to go back. Everyone should stay there at least once.", "Date": "December 19, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Charlotte, North Carolina", "Title": "\u201cLoved it!!\u201d", "Author": "ryansgirl", "ReviewID": "UR2887663", "Content": "I just returned from Vegas a few days ago and i must say TheHotel is definitely worth the money. Unfortunely, i could only afford to spend one night there but i wish i could have just moved in. The place is beautiful. Like some ot the others have said it is definitely dark in there but i guess because of the contempo theme they couldn't use too bright lights. The staff was very friendly and helpful. We walked right up to the registration desk and checked in eventhough it was 3 hours before check-in time. The room was big and the bathroom was the biggest i had ever been in! Flat screens in every room and everything was cleaned to perfection. My husband couldn't stop taking pics of the place and calling everyone he knows to let them know how nice of a hotel we were staying in! LOL I can't wait to go back to Vegas!! *My husband said we will only stay at TheHotel the next time we go to Vegas.

Great Rooms, love the three plasma televisions. The bathrooms are great, clean great soaking tub and seperate shower. Enjoyed soaking in the tub and watcing CNN. THEcafe has good food with somewhat spotty service. Sometimes on the money, other times not to great. I liked the idea of having the Cofee Bar a short distance from the elevator. The service is steadily improving. On my initial visit the front desk clerk was almost surly. The next visit I had to argue to get the floor and bed type I wanted. Things improved on the third visit the clerk was almost cordial from the start and my fourth visit( last week) I got an upgrade without requesting it and a cordial reception. One thing it would be nice to receive a welcome back after four stays of three nights each in the last 6 months. That is the reasons for the four rating in lieu of five. Still not top notch service but they are improving. Overall a great place to stay, a good value and a nice retreat from the insanity of the Mandalay Bay. Aside from the occasional service flaws it is a wonderful place to stay.

I've been to Vegas several times and stayed at the Venetian, New York New York, MGM and the Aladdian; The Hotel is in a class all its own.

The best part is the feeling that you are in a smaller hotel but connected to the larger Mandalay Bay / Luxor property. Constructive comments would be to upgrade the CD player in the bedroom and to provide more light in both rooms; dark is fine unless you'd like to see to iron, read, etc. If you have a car, the Valet parking is free and was convenient while we were there. I don't think the first part of Thanksgiving week is too crowded in LV, but we never had a problem/wait with getting the car. It was well worth the $2 tip for the convenience. From the parking deck take an immediate left over to Frank Sinatra Blvd. This street runs behind all the casinos on the West side of LV Blvd and makes getting to other properties in a car a snap. Only 1 light on the entire stretch. I understand this was built to help employess reach their jobs easier, but tourists should make note of it. At THEHotel, request a North facing room above the 23rd (or at least 10th) floor. I imagine that is a great view of the Strip. I think West facing rooms on any floor would have a great mountain view. We faced East for a view of the airport. Not bad, but there are better views. I like the Mandalay Bay Spa a bit better (roomier, more chairs to lounge on), but THEBathhouse is very nice; great showers! Watch their website for low rates (we had $149) and then make plans to take advantage of them.", "Date": "December 6, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cBest Choice in Vegas\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2863416", "Content": "We stayed here in late September 2004 and it was totally worth the money!

Hands down the best hotel in Las Vegas! Feels very much like a W Hotel and it's a nice change from the other hotels in Vegas that tend to over-do the decor. Plus you have the best of both worlds - connected to Mandalay Bay casino/shopping/theater yet self-contained in a great boutique hotel-like atmosphere that almost makes the hotel and its guests feel exclusive in a good way. Don't hesitate to stay here. The Bathhouse Spa is worth checking out too - a great place to relax. I've stayed at Venetian, Aladdin, Luxor and Treasure Island so I have some basis for comparison.
