They did however have a breakfast room and we enjoyed the best breakfast we could have had, with an amazing range of foods.not just the usual Continental breakfast of ham and cheese.The staff spoke English (we do not speak fluent German) and were very helpful.A great hotel and very good value for money even with the falling pound/euro exchange rate .", "Date": "Dec 16, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR491289889", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Izzycord"}, {"Content": "Great Value This was the first hotel we booked for our month long triop to Europe.

Its a block off the river and about a 15 minute walk to Sachsenhausen.The hotel appeared to be completely new inside. Not sure how long ago it was renovated, but it looked very modern and clean. We had 2 rooms, both with two beds (one had a couch for a 3rd person) and balconies. The tv had 3 or 4 English channels. The bath in our room was huge with a full size tub/shower. The other room had just a shower. The elevator was slow (but it had one) so we took the stairs most of the time. No air, but the windows opened and it was nice to have the outside air. There is also a nice comfy down duvet on the bed. The bed was a little more comfortable than many European hotels I've stayed at.Breakfast was more than the typical European breakfast with a good selection of eggs/sausage, croissants, breads, fresh fruit, cheese, cold cut meats, tea, coffee, juices. The front desk staff were very friendly and the lady we made the arrangements with (via email) was most accommodating.

Since there wasn't any by the time we got to the hotel, we asked to park the car in the Best Western Plaza garage. This is available for an addition 8 or 10 euro (I don't exactly remember how much). The only thing is, whenever you want to get your car in or out of the garage, you have to ask the receptionist to open the garage door. It isn't too much trouble unless the receptionist isn't behind the front desk!The room on the other hand was great. We asked for 2 double rooms near each other which is what we received. The room was big in resepect to european standards. The beds were perfect, I had a good night's sleep on it. The bathroom was pretty spacious with a towel warming rack.

There's also a standard hairdryer which I was so happy to see (instead of those vaccum type that were in both hotels we stayed at in Italy)!All in all, this is a perfect place for one or two nights.

The same lady was most helpful when I rquested a fan given the heat, the fan was mentioned on the in room details. She brought it up quickly. The fan was more use than some supposed Air Con at some more upmarket hotels we used on the trip.We wanted 2 keys which required them to re cut the lock on the door, the same lady did this too in about 5 mins!

I travel quite a lot and this has happened to me at Holiday Inns and Best Westerns before. They had even had the cheek to ring it up before showing me the bill. There were 2 of us so it was 4 x 11euros for the 2 nights. The lady, different to the heroine above!, was not particularly gracious about recrediting it although that has worked since on my bill.Whether I would have noticed had I not already have paid the sizeable accommodation bill is a moot point. I wonder how many breakfasts they don't provide and charge for during the year that folk don't notice when its a smaller part of the bill?Nice German restaurant and bar left out of hotel and right at top of the street.

Not a bad price, but I actually paid extra for a studio. The room I was assigned was small, with two twin beds, a desk, two desk chairs, and a small bathroom. To me, a studio hotel room is more of a small suite, with a couch. When I questioned this with the desk clerk, I was told no, I was in a large room which is a studio. I wasn't upset, since the 67 Euros a night was still a good deal. I'll just know better next time, and will e-mail to get a room description.That said, I would highly recommend this hotel for a Frankfurt stay. It's 4-5 blocks from the train station, it's very clean, and everything (carpet, furnishings, etc.)appears to be only a couple of years old. It reminded me of a Hampton Inn -- nothing fancy, but very clean and functional, and a good value. It can, however, be a little difficult to find if you don't have a good map. If you are arriving by train or plane, I would suggest taking a taxi to the hotel the first time. Then you can get your bearings.

The hotel rooms were very clean, modern and quiet with wonderful, helpful staff. And yes, we too found the rooms a little hot at night until we were treated to an amazing thunder and lightening storm which thankfully cooled the rooms down too. We loved our stroll along the Maine River to downtown (about 20-30 minutes) and enjoyed the beautiful old buildings in the very lively main square. Unfortunately the suggested german restaurant on the corner was closed for holidays but the friendly front desk staff directed us to another restaurant on the south side (old part of the city on the other side of the bridge) called Schanke on Schweizer Street. This is an old german beer parlour with a lovely, casual inner courtyard restaurant. The food was tasty and the atmosphere wonderful!

We skipped their breakfast option because we love walking around and getting our own pastries, but if you want the convenience of staying in, their breakfast is very delightful. I also like the free espresso they make for you at the counter (if you ask for it). It is located on a side street in a residental area from the busy road that goes by the train station, so it affords you a little more peace and quiet. I recommend the restaurant/pub on the corner for some good old fashioned German cooking.They do a great job with the cleaning. The rooms are of a good size. If you get a corner room, it has two twin beds and a daybed type of couch so you could easily have a child/teen sleep on that and not be too crowded.We took the train from the airport (15 min ride) to the station and just walked from there. Maybe take a cab if you brought overpacked, large bags. If you haven't been to Europe before and bring large, overpacked bags...you will learn a lesson not to do that again.The hotel is close to the bus lines, but beware that they stop running about 7 or 8pm.
