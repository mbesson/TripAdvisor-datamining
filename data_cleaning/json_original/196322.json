{"Reviews": [{"Content": "What a GREAT hotel! I loved this hotel. The location is great, just outside the Porta Romano, one of the gates to the old city wall. It is a short walk to the bus, and a 15 minute walk to the Ponte Vecchio, all a flat, easy walk.It was quiet and romantic, and very reasonably priced. The night-shift woman at the desk was so nice and helpful. I was traveling alone, and would definitely recommend this place. I agree with the previous comment about breakfast. Especially if you have to pay, skip the breakfast.", "Date": "Apr 29, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR394189639", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "SFvoyager08"}, {"Content": "Super location, lovely staff Spent a week here in early April. The hotel had a real comfy feel to it, and our room by Italian standards was gigantic! Staff couldn't have been more helpful, where to eat, where to visit and so on, also booking some of our visits for us so we didn't have to join the queues. We followed all their suggestions and were delighted. The best part though was the location on a lovely tree-lined avenue; peace and quiet and still only 10 minutes stroll from the Pitti Palace and the Ponte Vecchio. Breakfast hasn't really improved but this is a minor quibble. I'd go back in a flash.

We enjoyed our stay, partly because of the Classic Hotel. Wonderful green neighborhood. Classic old tall building. Our room on the first floor, left corner was so TALL that they had a separate accommodation above (loft style) for our kid. PERFECT. Bird chirping in the morning and lovley setting. Wonderful grounds (what hotel in Florence has grounds?) Outstanding sunroom for sitting and reading. Tables outside. Trees all over the grounds. And, if you are driving, generous, attractive parking. Unheard of. Very friendly people, very helpful. Nice little breakfast. Long walk to Ponte Vecchio...but we got used to it and did it many times. The hotel is a quiet retreat from the insane blasting scooter and vehicle noise that otherwise curses Florence. OK, OK, there is a road in front that carries some traffic, but very little noise and quiet at night. Ahhhhh. Reasonable price. Highly recommended. We would go again if my wife could ever get me to go back to wildly overcrowded and noisy Florence (doubtful)....", "Date": "Apr 22, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR776728969", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Definitely a Classic I spent 4 nights at the Classic Hotel. The hotel is in a lovely 19th century villa and has very pleasant grounds. Given the crowds and traffic in the heart of Florence, there is much to be said for having a retreat just outside the city walls. It is about a 2 block walk to the city wall and the bus stop, and about a 15 minute walk to the River Arno. (The only problem with walking into town is that the sidewalks are narrow, and the buses that rumble by are rather large.) There are various small stores, post office, and banks near the bus stop. This area of Florence has a relatively 'lived-in' feel -- yes, there will be plenty of tourists on the streets, but also locals going about their daily activities. The hotel staff were all very pleasant and spoke good English. As other reviewers have noted, breakfast is adequate but no more than that (but who goes to Florence for the breakfasts?) The room and bathroom were clean, comfortable, and reasonably spacious.The last night I was there, several mosquitoes had a happy time biting me. Although it was cool enough to leave the window open overnight, rather than use the air conditioner, I should have relied on modern technology! Keeping the window closed at night would also have cut the traffic noise. (There are far too many motor scooters in Florence, and a few of them are ridden along the Viale Machiavelli.)", "Date": "Jun 21, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR357635094", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Dot33"}, {"Content": "The Best Hotel in Florence, Italy...: ) This hotel is within an extremely romantic setting and sorrounded by the Boboli Gardens.

My boyfriend and I stayed at the 3* Classic Hotel, Florence in June 2004. Just outside the old-town walls, it's a pretty, 19thC villa set on a (very welcome) shady street alongside the Boboli gardens. It's a 20min walk to the Uffizzi and other Florentine spectacles, but you can jump on the bus and be there in 5. The rooms are generally large and decorated with antiques, but bathrooms are on the small side. Our room was double height - and the bathroom was up on a mezzanine, together with a sofa and further single bed. Considering the prices of hotels in Florence we thought it was good value even without the usual mini-bar/room service facilities. The only problem was the breakfast. Italians don't do breakfast, as we found out here - a few crusty rolls, pastries, appalling coffee and cornflakes were on the buffet, though none looked appetising. The fruit juice machine was not working and there was no way to make proper Espresso coffee. I even had to search the cupboards for a bowl and spoon as none had been left out. When we decided to forgo breakfast on the second morning, we were surprised to see it had been credited on our final bill - and to the tune of 16 Euros per person - so well worth just grabbing something from the local cafes on the morning walk into the centre! However the great benefit to those driving is it is one of the only hotels of this rating to have parking - notoriously difficult in the rest of Florence.", "Date": "Jun 16, 2004", "ReviewID": "UR684335561", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "eleanort6"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187895-d196322-r15457465-Classic_Hotel-Florence_Tuscany.html", "HotelID": "196322", "Price": "$124"}}
