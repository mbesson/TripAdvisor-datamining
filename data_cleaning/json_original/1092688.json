The air conditioned rooms have all been recently refurbished, and have nice tiled bathrooms with fairly spacious bedrooms. Some rooms have 2 double beds, some have a double and a single, some have one double. The price is 250,000 rupiah per night, which is very reasonable considering some very run down old hotels in Ubud are charging double that. Each room has a small terrace or balcony where breakfast is served every morning. Breakfast is a fairly dismal affair, but it is included in the price. A thermos of hot tea is placed on your table twice a day. The grounds are lovely, and the large family of several generations live there. The front of the complex is quite noisy at times, with the lively young children of the family, so ask for a room at the rear. Overall, this is excellent value for money, but the young boys who seem to take care of running the place (and who I think are family members) are far from helpful, and you'll be left to drag your own luggage up and down the stairs. There are cheaper rooms here, and I did see the inside of my neighbour's room - for 150,000 rp, it was very run down and basic - much better to pay the extra and get a lovely clean refurbished room. The location is central to all the main areas of ubud.", "Date": "Jun 29, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR364236854", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "WestOzgirl"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297701-d1092688-r22054561-Sania_s_House_Bungalows-Ubud_Bali.html", "HotelID": "1092688", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
