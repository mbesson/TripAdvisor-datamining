No way, this Hotel looks (and smells) like it hasn't seen any remodelation for the last 30 years.

This is perhaps the best value in town. 2 blocks from Reforma and the American Embassy, close to public transportation, only a few miles away from the Zocalo and the Templo Mayor, you won't find a better hotel! The food was great, and the staff remembered me from my prior stays there (May and November of last year.) There are indeed some issues with their wireless connection but the desktops at the lobby are fast and efficient. The night staff always took great care of me, and the night phone operator, Eduardo, is fluent in English, French and German, and is extremely knowledgeable of the city and its surroundings.

The service and food in the restaurant was way below standard for the prices, although I found the room service waiter very polite and attentive. Every morning a housekeeper barged into my room wanting to know if I had any cleaning, without waiting for me to open the door myself. The person who cleaned my room more often than not took all of my items from where I had left them for my convenience and left them in different places. One day they re-arranged the way I had hung my clothes in the closet! Things that were clearly not rubbish were thrown away. The walls in the room were paper thin, to the extent that one night I needed to telephone the guest next door and ask them to turn down their television so I could sleep. The beds were tiny, masquerading as doubles, but really only single beds. Also, mattresses about as comfortable as sleeping on the floor and no extra blankets provided. They advertise wireless internet, but it there is a cost involved, and it is very unreliable which is not what I expect from a business hotel.", "Date": "August 29, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sarasota, Florida", "Title": "\u201cSeems to be a really nice hotel, for the $$\u201d", "Author": "kimanjo", "ReviewID": "UR14957049", "Content": "Let me start by saying I did NOT stay at this hotel. I was staying 1.5 blocks away at the Casa Gonzales, a budget hotel/pensione in the $60 range. Great cheap little restuarant acorss the plaza called El Mister. However, my daughter and I did walk by the hotel (a beautiful little outdoor cafe area) and we were very impressed. As a matter of fact, my daughter asked why we weren't staying at the Hotel Bristol, which appeared to be more \"together\". Although Casa Gonzalez is quaint--nice floral courtyard--the rooms are very inconsistant and some have an incredible amount of black mould on the bathroom ceilings (and I am tolerant of mold in bathrooms, living in Florida and used to the problems of high humidity).

My girlfriend and I stayed at the Bristol two nights on February 2007. The employees treated us very well, room service was fine, although one of the nights, it took them over half an hour to bring the meal up to the room, then the waiter tried to keep one dollar extra of our change claiming a \"mistake\"... But we reported this to the people at the front desk and they said they would talk to the waiter. I am almost sure that it was an isolated case, though, because other members of my family have stayed there and they never had a problem like that before. Everything else was great. They have a pretty good restaurant with plenty of Mexican dishes, and the service was excellent.
