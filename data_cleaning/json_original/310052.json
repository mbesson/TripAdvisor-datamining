The night desk clerk, Lisette, was fantastically sweet and helpful and the location was great. (The daytime girl was not as friendly.) Also it took quite a long time for our rooms to be ready--we got there around 2 pm but couldn't check in until 5:30--and even then, the sheets from the previous occupant were on the floor, all balled up & waiting for the laundry (we just put them outside the door, and they were gone when we stepped out an hour later). There's no food but there's a great little seafood place down the street and it's around the corner from all the shops and restaurants on Calle 10. Plus it's a block from the beach and next to a fun bar called Dirty Martini. And the cost was less than a quarter of what we would have paid at our all-inclusive.

From what I hear, the local government can regulate the noise level during non-peak/holiday times. I was there for New Year's Eve so they couldn't really do anything about it.

Nicola (one of the owners) was there to personally great me on arrival and offer any assitance I required. Over the coming days all the staff became a welcome sight and were keen to ensure I was enjoying myself. They will advise you which tours would be good for your style and will do all the running around for you. The grounds and rooms are kept extremely clean and the coffee each morning in the lounge area was a great start to the day. TCB is one street over from the beach and one street over from 5th avenida, the main tourist stretch in town. There is a small bar (the dirty martini) right next to reception. Perfect for an after dive drink or quite a few after dinner. The atmosphere is friendly and the staff attentive. The Abyss dive shop is also just next door. Having returned to diving after a long spell, it was great to wake up, wander down with a coffee and then head out for the mulitple dive sites. The Abyss team were fantastic, Dave, Nick, Cori, Diana, Robert, Jason and all the boat crew made me feel welcome from the start and nothing was too much trouble. One drawback to the great location of this hotel are the local nite clubs. They are just around the corner and being a light sleeper I did suffer from the late night music. This is no fault of the hotel and Nicola is very involved in working through these challenges with the club owners and the local government. They kindly moved me on the third nite to a larger, quieter room in the back of the hotel which was alot better and after a few more nights the noise was less of an issue. Also be aware that the beds (all hotels are the same) are very firm and if you like it soft like me, you may need to bring a mattress topper or something similar. If you have any concerns though, make them known to the staff. I only had to mention the noise and they set the wheels in motion to try to solve the problem.They will work hard to make your stay a pleasant one and if you do not tell them, then they will not know.

We were a very diverse group to say the least. All different ages, interestes, coming from cities all over the U.S. and England. Nicola and her staff at TCB took care of every last detail: booking activities for almost 100 people that included scuba diving, snorkelling, dinner outings, yoga, and spa services. Stocking our Villa refrigerator with beverages and constantly providing homemade food throughout the day (think huevos, guacamole, ceviche, quesadillas, pasta!). Each guest even had a customized welcome packet with their name on it, including all the scheduled activities and events, a welcome letter, a map of Playa and even a book of what the city of offers. There are many hotels to choose from in Playa but this was by far the most welcoming, hospitable, genuine staff I have seen... and I travel a lot and stay in hotels all over the world! As the bride I was able to completely relax, assured that all of my guests' needs were taken care of and that their happiness was TCB's number one priority.

Last fall I made a trip to Belize, via Playa del Carmen and this year I'm heading to Tikal in Guatamaula. So why stop at Tropical Casablanca? First of all I know whatever happens on the rest of my trip it will start and end on a high note. Whether you are new to TCB or a return visiter you are treated like an old friend. On my last trip I had three primary objectives, get to the Belize, where I already had reservations, seek out and find the best of Mexican wines and spend a few days diving with the Abyss dive shop. (part of the hotel) Nicola and her crew took care of the first two, setting me up with the bus service to the border and researching what was available in town as far as Mexican wines. (a little known secret but there are some very good ones.) As far as the diving is concerned, Dave and his staff are the best dive shop in town. Small groups and friendly caring staff guarantee a safe and enjoyable trip, whether in the ocean or the cenotes. TCB is a great place to unwind and slow down to Mexican time. It's like a little oasis in the middle of Playa del Carmen, one block from the beach, close to 5 th but still far enough removed that you are not in the center of the all night craziness that exists in some areas. I know that Dave and Nicola both spend time training their staff, but more importantly they seem to be able to attract and keep people who think like they do. As a result they have built a business that from the owners to the night watchman really care about their customers.

Unfortunately, the weather wasn't very nice during the week we were there but thankfully we were diving so it didn't matter too much.

The combination of the hotel and the dive shop meant I could wake up at a leisurely time, have a coffee and step into the shop to get suited up while still holding on to my TCB cup of coffee!

This hotel is the best location for shopping 5th ave. All the great eating spots are close by and easy to walk to. Java Joe's is just around the corner for your early coffee and roll.

The hotel slogan is \u201cThe feel good hotel\u201d. A place to relax and get away from chaos. I am afraid that the hotel mission statement cannot be accomplished as it is located literally next door to Playa Del Carmen clubbing epicentre. We are talking many huge open air bars and clubs. The main intersection of where everybody goes to drink, dance and party till 4-5 in the morning. I would strongly advise NOT to stay in room 15, 14 and 13 since they are overlooking the streets of that intersection. They also have a Martini club right underneath them (it was under construction when I was there). At night, in room 15, you can almost feel the base pounding in your chest at time. So my two first night did not made me \u201cfeel good\u201d but made me want to kill those DJ\u2019s! I got moved to room 12 after mentioning the loud noises and the problem was solved. I could still hear a bit of music but nothing like the other room and I could easily fall asleep at anytime. The hotel front desk entrance with its big coffee table and 3 sofas under a big palapa roof is very welcoming and beautiful. The staff wear smiles and are very friendly. The hotel is all white and is surrounding a very luscious exotic garden. A nice little paradise that is very peaceful (before the clubs open). The rooms are also all white and very clean. I had one double bed, a small wood table with 2 chairs and a small fridge that was very convenient for water and fruits. The bed smelled nice and was comfortable. I enjoyed the nice chenille throw that was on top of it and the bathrobe too. The bathroom was clean and pleasant. I would recommend bringing your own shampoo and conditioner as those offered have essential oil in them that leave a greasy residue on the hair. I was disappointed that there was no TV, no telephone, no hairdryer and no safe in the rooms. I went to Wall Mart and got a hairdryer for 15$ but really was not happy about the extra spending since I already have one at home and it\u2019s so cheap that most hotel offer one it the room knowing people don\u2019t want to pack their luggage with these kinds of essential items. The hotel owner was very helpful and went out of her way to lend me her DVD player and she and one of the front desk employee lend me DVD. I really appreciated it. I traveled alone so I needed some entertainment at certain time of day like when returning from my afternoon at the beach or when I return after a late dinner in the evening. Coffee is offered at the front desk each morning and on Saturdays they arrange a very good buffet with chicken, fish, salad and pasta next to the pool for only 10$. I wish they would have done this every night because it was very pleasant. This is not a beach front property but it is only a few step away from it. It has a big pool where scuba diving lessons are giving in the morning by the diving company that is associated with the hotel and located right next to it.
