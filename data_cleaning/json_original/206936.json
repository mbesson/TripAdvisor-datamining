The arrangments were all in order and we arrived at 1830 on the 11th we were shown to our room (6th floor) which was very comfortable,twin beds good bathroom size and a safe worked by the 4 digit code, typical across hotels nowadays, the only downside is the vibration that the hotel suffers when a Metro train passes along the line which must be directly under the building, they do stop about midnight but on a Saturday night provide an all night service. The buffet breakfast was typical of any European hotel that I have stayed in, a good selection of pastries, cereals, and juices, followed by bacon, sausage and scrambled eggs, one guest asked for a fried egg, and this was done in minutes. Tea and coffee are brought to the table as required, though the tea is particuarly weak (for my tastes) All of the staff that we met were pleasant and polite and were happy to answer any queries. When you first leave the hotel doors and venture outside, the location becomes a sure fire winner, to the right is La Rambla, and to the left is Passeig De Gracia, a lot of the sights are off either of these two roads. The Metro provides a good service on various lines around the city, and the price is good, 2 Euros for a single trip, if you buy 10 single trip tickets this comes down to under 1 Euro, various Rovers are available as well. Taxi's are also relatively cheap, and if there are more than 3 of you then a taxi would probably be cheaper than the Metro. The works of Gaudi are a big influence on Barcelona, from the Sagrada Familia to La Pedrera and many other buildings besides. The Sagrada Familia is probably the best known of them all and well worth a visit, it will \"blow you away\" my wife and I intend to return when the building work is completed (2026) 100 years after Gaudi's death. We ate an evening meal at the Avenida, and found it to be both reasonably priced and good quality, the hotel seemed very quiet during our stay, which did surpirise me a bit. Travel to and from the airport is easy and a shuttle bus run every 6 minutes from 0500-0100 from either T1 or T2 and finishes/starts at Placa de Catalunya, just one block from the Avenida, my wife and I travelled on the train from the airport to the centre and were subjected to a failed pick-pocket attempt when we left the station for street level (not nice!), needless to say our journey back to the airport was on the shuttle bus ! All the guide books warn about pick-pockets and they seem to be correct, however this did not spoil our stay in Barcelona and has not put us off returning in 2027 when we will celebrate our 50th anniversary !", "Date": "March 6, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "USA", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location\u201d", "Author": "coloradorailfan", "ReviewID": "UR125697272", "Content": "We stayed at Avenida six days in February 2012.

The hotel is in a great location and for the most part was comfortable. The breakfast was very good - the waiters very accomodating. We ate dinner in the hotel one evening and the food was excellent. It is a bit strange for dinner however. They close the main dining room and set tables just outside it. There were 3 tables set - 2 were occupied. The waiters go in and out of the closed dining room to access the kitchen. It's kind of like eating on someone's front porch. Our real complaints did not begin until we were leaving the hotel. While the people at reception were never particularly friendly - or helpful - we didn't need them until we were leaving. As we exited the hotel to get into the taxi for the airport my mother's shoe became wedged under the revolving door. She was pushed to the ground in front of the hotel. There is no automatic stop on the door and at 94 she certainly couldn't stop it. She had a bad cut over her eye and was very bruised. The hotel staff seemed more interested in cleaning up the blood on their doorstep then in helping clean up their guest. One young lady - I'm sorry I did not get her name - did get us a chair and a towel but she was the only helpful one. So far their only comment has been that they are not responsible for the misuse of their facilities. I still can't figure out how walking through a revolving door is misuse???

On my arrival, initially I found the staff to be a bit cold while disseminating information however as the day progress, my group found that the hotel staff warmed to us and became more friendly and helpful as they probably found our attempt to speak spanish amusing. I must say Javier who was at the desk when we checked in and was there two days later when we checked out was the most helpful and patient with all our questions. The breakfast was included with our stay and it was an experience. We did not enjoy the selection but the dining room staff were the most friendly people we met on this vacation so we tried each day to find one food to love. The best thing about this hotel is the location to the museums, the shops, the tour bus and Las Ramblas. Being on the nineth floor did not stop me a surburban girl from hearing the underground train but if you are on the first floor it is worst.

The very impressive lobby and public rooms as you enter the hotel are sadly not reflected in the rest of the building which is somwhat tired and gloomy.

It was wonderful. The room clean with a sleeping chamber plus a sitting room. Bath was large with double vanity sinks, tub/shower, toilet and bidet. Keep in mind most European properties do not have wash cloths and if you want a face cloth, carry one with you. The beds were comfortable and our room faced the main street. Location is perfect with a Metro station within 100 yeards and within walking distance of Catalunya Square and Las Ramblas. Breakfast was buffet and adequate. While there is a restaurant on property, I suggest seeking out other restaurant opportunities, perhaps on the Las Ramblas for evening.

I was traveling with a group of about 30 people who were staying at the Hotel Colon in Barcelona, we chose the Barcelona Palace so that we could book a more spacious room. It was very interesting to be able to compare the two hotels. Both are beautiful and both are in excellent locations. The Barcelona Palace is very beautiful, clean and has an \"old world\" style to it. We spoke with the gentelmen at the front desk many times and they were professional but not particularly friendly. They never went out of their way to say one more word than was required or to offer much in the way of recommendations. I would not say that we were treated warmly. Our room was spacious and clean but I kept thinking that the hotel's motto should be \"don't get too comfortable\" because of it's coolness. We did have a junior suite which offered a bedroom and a sitting room, like a small apartment - that was great as we had a rather large amount of luggage. The bathroom was clean and had dual sinks, which I always appreciate. I noticed right away that they had provided us with shampoo and body wash as the only bath products and just 2 bath towels. We asked at the front desk to see if hari conditioner and body lotion were available and they said they were not but that we could purchase them at the salon in the lobby. This is not an inexpensive hotel and this just didn't seem like the right answer to me. We got a similar reply when we asked where we could find a local market to purchase drinking water. We were told to use the mini bar. Again, not a good answer. Because we were showering twice a day, we had to request that additional towels be delivered each day....you would think that they would just make sure that 4 bath towels were provided to save themselves the trouble of having to run additional towels up to the rooms. We requested ice on two occasions (there is no icemaker) instead of bring an ice bucket as most hotels would do, we reveived a small bowl of ice the first time and a plate of ice the second time. Again, this response just seemed strange. The beds were firm as were the pillows, but not as uncomfortable as I was afraid they would be. Although we had requested a king suite, the king was made with two twin beds next to each other. This is common in Europe, but typically they will use a bumper of sorts to fill in the gap between the 2 mattresses....but no, we are in the hotel that doesn't want you to get too comfortable and we found that the twin beds were made up individually and the sheet on the center side of each bed was tucked into it's respective mattress so deeply and firmly that it was nearly impossible to touch any part of the person sleeping in the other bed - it was as if we were being swaddled. Additionally, only one of the two beds had a blanket, I spent the first two nights with just sheet covering me - yup, it's that comfort thing.... We visited our friends room at the Hotel Colon and found that this hotel was also in an excellent location, perhaps better than the Barcelona Palace because it would have less motor traffic. The atmosphere was much lighter and more comfortable, less old world formality. I asked my friends if their bathroom amenities had been sparce and learned that they were given every amenity imagineable including sewing kits....I asked about their bed configuration and was told that the beds were full kings with no swaddling involved....the rooms at the Hotel Colon had floor to ceiling shutters that were just beautiful and all in all, that hotel was much more comfortable and inviting. bottom line is that if I was going to be in Barcelona again, I would stay at the Hotel Colon or perhaps at the Hotel Crystal Palace which was in a lovely little neighborhood around the corner from the Barcelona Palace.", "Date": "May 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington DC, District of Columbia", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location, Very Good Value\u201d", "Author": "dreww13", "ReviewID": "UR109397622", "Content": "This hotel was perfectly located on Grand Via, just steps from the Metro stop and a very short walk to Las Ramblas.

(We later learned that although they had the same name there was no relationship-) The bedroom was extremely small 8x10 and the bathroom was so small if you used the toilet your knees ended up under the sink. I want back to the desk and asked what class room we were given. I was told it was a regular double. I went back to the room and got my confirmation and showed it to the desk again. Reponse: \"Oh yes you have a deluxe double\". I asked for an explanation and was told it was all marketing issues. I ask the desk represntative to come and see my room. She was very unfriendly but I persisted and she came. I asked to see other double deluxe rooms and after some discussion I was shown two---both bigger and nicer than ours. I would never stay there again....the staff is haughty, rooms classifications are quite arbitrary. Finally I was told by rhe desk clerk that that the room classification is a nightmare and she wished management would solve it and not put her in such a difficult position. I was offered another room, but we were leaving early the next morning and did not want the hassle. I had already wasted too much of my time.

This was our favorite hotel on the trip, and we stayed at two very nice Marriotts in London and Paris. What sets this hotel apart is its fantastic location. It's a very quick walk to Las Ramblas, a major thoroughfare that leads to vendors, artists, and the ultimate fresh food market, the Boqueria. You can also easily walk to two major architectural works by Gaudi - Casa Mila and Casa Batllo. The hotel is located in the Eixample, Barcelona's shopping district, which means you are surounded by just about every type of shop you can imagine. And around the corner is one of the best tapas restaurants in the city - Tapas 24. We ate there twice in four nights. Finally, it's a short walk to two metro stops. The inside of the hotel is lovely. My partner, who is in the hotel industry, calls it \"classic 1940s.\" A giant spiral staircase leading to the guest rooms, banisters of gold filigree, blue carpeting, and white walls with marble accents. We were happy with the service, but can see why other people had complaints about it. This is not the kind of hotel where doormen, bell hops and other staff are practically tripping over themselves to say hello or offer assistance. For example, we weren't offered any help with our bags at check-in or check-out, which is pretty unusual for a hotel of this caliber. This didn't really bother us, but we noticed. I like to call this kind of service \"unobtrusive.\" Having said that, the people at the front desk were very friendly and helpful whenver we asked for anything. The housekeeping staff kept our room clean. The wait staff in the dining room was friendly and efficient. We booked our room to include a breakfast buffet every morning, and it was worth it in my opinion. The hotel seems to cater to a lot of American tourists, so the buffet serves a lot of American breakfast dishes (scrambled eggs, bacon, cereal, etc.) and some traditional Barcelona fare (Iberico ham, egg tortillas, etc.) We would eat a big breakfast to prepare ourselves for a day of walking and sight seeing, eat a small lunch, and engorge ouselves on tapas in the evenings. A note about the elevators: They are extremely slow. We tried waiting for them a couple times (once we had our bags and were checking out), but we lost patience. We were on the third floor, so it was easy to take the stairs and it was a good way to walk off all those tapas. I recommend staying away from the higher floors unless you want a good climb several times a day, or you have a good book to read while waiting for the elevator.", "Date": "May 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cNot 4 Star quality\u201d", "Author": "Ajandmuffpuff", "ReviewID": "UR106128934", "Content": "The location is perfect, but that is the only thing positive about our stay.

The trip from the airport on the Airport bus was a breeze and cost 5 E. From the last bus stop at P. Catalyuna, you walk up about 2 blocks and make a left on Gran Via. The hotel is then right in front of you. If you can walk 2 blocks with luggage, no need to pay for a taxi. The hotel was convenient to the metro, which was easy to use. If you purchase a T-10 ticket, it is good for 10 rides and can be used by several people. It is also good on the bus. If you need to transfer from the metro to the bus and continue in the same direction within an hour, you scan the card and it doesn't cost anything additional. It is simple to purchase at the metro machines (they can not be purchased on the bus). The room wasn't ready when we arrived early in the morning, but they held our luggage while we went out for the day. It is a popular pre and post cruise hotel, so they luggage area got quite busy on cruise days. The beds were very comfortable, as were the pillows. We had adjoining rooms with our adult children. There is a nice size safe in the room, although you would not be able to fit a laptop in. Closet space was plentiful. There is a refrigerator in the room with a mini-bar. We had a room at the back of the hotel, and the metro noise was barely noticeable and not bothersome at all. We didn't bring our laptops, but they offer free connections in the lobby only. They also have a business center, but charge for internet. We had tapas next door to the hotel at Cuidad Contal, which is good, but expensive. It's a nice treat and one of the better, more popular tapas places. There is a wait, anytime of day. We grabbed sandwiches a few times across the street from the hotel at Farga. I recommend the salmon sandwich. There is a supermarket in the basement of El Corte Ingles, where we purchased wine and some other odds and ends. It was strange paying for different items at different places. You can eat at the top of El Corte Ingles, but we didn't check it out. Breakfast in the hotel was good, with a combination of meats, cheese, a variety of breads, eggs, desserts and a wonderful fruit salad. They were accomodating and made eggs over. I thought my camera memory card was taken, but I had misplaced it. The staff took it seriously and checked into it. I felt terrible. Front desk staff, Dorian, originally from Wales was the most helpful. He shared information on how to get to various places, and checked our flight information for us. One of the other gentlemen would not check our flight info without seeing our ticket, but with email, who has tickets these days. We were \"lucky\" enough to be in Barcelona during the countrywide general strike. Some of the staff were off and other staff slept over. Although they worked with minimal staff, it was hard to notice the difference in service. The only thing we couldn't get were our eggs over. Javier, the general manager/owner, was worried for his staff during the strike and was often found standing in front of the hotel. He joined us for a glass of Sangria before heading home to his family when the strike was over. He also slept at the hotel during the strike. During the strike, was walked La Rambla to the end and hung out at the port. It's about a 20 minute walk, but barely noticeable, since you stop along the way. Once at the port, you didn't even know there was a strike. It was very calm. At the beach, which we took the metro to and got off at Olympic Village, we visited Ice Barcelona. Access is from the beach. We had to ask several people until we found it. Outside, it is a regular bar. Never did an Ice Bar before, so it was an experience to try once. The hotel had brochures that gave 10% off, so it cost us 13.50 E admission, which included a drink. The girls only had sandals on, so when they got cold, they had an extra parka to throw over their feet. We felt safer walking around Barcelona than in Madrid, where twice, someone attempted to take our belongings while walking in the streets. Never once in Barcelona did we have an issue. Last time in Barcelona, I stayed at the Apsis Atrium Palace. I can make a few comparisons. They are located on the same street, The rooms in the Apsis Atrium Palace were more modern, they had a pool and jacuzzi in the basement. Breakfast at Avenida Palace was better, and I enjoyed my stay at Avenida more. I would not hesitate to recommend it and would definitely stay there again. If you plan to visit La Sagrada (a must), and Gaudi's house at Guell Parc, you can purchase a combo tix for 14 E, only at La Sagrada. If you purchase separately, it costs 3.50 E more. Guell Parc is also a must see. We took bus # 24 from the hotel to Guell Parc. It's more convenient than the Hop On-Hop Off bus, which we didn't use this time. The Ho-Ho bus lets you off at the bottom of the hill for Guell Parc and it's a nice walk up hill. The bus will also drop you at the bottom if you prefer, but I recommend continuing on the bus for a few more stops and get off at the top of the park and walk down. Most people still left on the bus will get off at the top, so you just walk with the crowd. It is a crowded bus, due to all the tourists, expect to stand. Going back to the hotel, we were able to pick up the bus by continuing to walk to the bottom of the street. Feel free to ask me any questions. I know there are many things I forgot to mention", "Date": "October 2, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Princeton, NJ", "Title": "\u201cIn the heart of it all!\u201d", "Author": "JLNairn0803", "ReviewID": "UR81336702", "Content": "This could not have been in a better location!

A Spanish man came in shortly afterwards and the lady behind reception checked him in before me. I was extremely tired and didn't want to make a fuss so I waited until she was free. She was very rude and abrupt and didn't smile once!! The two men behind reception carried on chatting away to each other and didn't even offer to take my bags to the room. My room was on the top floor and had a view out to the back which was basicaly a car park and office blocks. The room was very dark and depressing and had an interconnecting door to the next bedroom. As a lone female traveller I was not at all happy about having a door between me and the very load man in the next room. I spoke to the rude lady on reception, she said that she could not move me to another room as they were full and she suggested that if I am not happy about the interconnecting door then I should put a chair next to it to make me feel safer!!! The walls are paper thin and you can hear people talking and watching TV in the next room. No drink making facilities and the mini bar was very expensive 3.60 \u20ac for a small bottle of diet coke. The only good thing about this hotel is it's location. It is in a beautiful part of the city and is within walking distance of La Rambla.

Air conditioner barely blew any air during the day but definitely shut off completely during the night providing no air flow or exchange within room. No view from our room except to see the air handlers and electric boxes of adjoining building. Window opening not recommended due to city sewage odor. The unimpressive, boring buffet breakfast which was not included was ridiculously expensive. The breakfast matron at the door of breakfast room was surly. Filled coffee urns were guardedly kept behind her on a table doled out only in between her assigning guests to tables after she officiously checked to make sure they were indeed hotel guests.

It is within walking distance of everything you want to see, of course depending on how much you are willing to walk. It's a block from La Ramblas and really close to the train station. The exterior and the lobby look very pretty and luxurious. The suite was really spacious and there were two flatscreen tvs. There was a separate living room and a hallway leading up to the bedroom/living room/bathroom. On to the bad. The furniture and the decorations looked like they might have been nice once but were now shabby and worn. The rug and bedding were threadbare and could definitely use an upgrade. The worst part for me was that it was dirty. There were hairs in the sink and bathtub from previous occupants and the bathroom floor wasn't clean. My feet were dirty after walking around on the rug barefoot (forgot my slippers). Lastly, the hotel staff is not very friendly and pretty much only answer yes or no if you ask a question. The price for internet service, as mentioned by other reviewers, is outrageous! I have stayed at lower rated hotels that have been a lot nicer (and cleaner). A four star hotel should, at the very least, be clean. Also, I would have traded in the 2 flat screen tvs for newer bedding. Considering the price I paid for this hotel, I feel a little guilty for complaining. If I had paid the list price, I would have been furious! I would not stay at this hotel again, even for the price I paid. On a random note, there was a strike going on outside the hotel while we were there.

Request a room at the rear of the hotel. (no view but quieter) 2.

I'm in the IT business myself, and I know just how cheap wifi is, so I really resent overpricing like this. There is no need for it anymore, and it makes the hotel uncompetitive, in my opinion.

We booked room only to experience the local cafes etc. for food and we were not disappointed. Places I would recommend are : Udon - a noodle bar in the Gothic Quarter, Ginos - a very good italian restaurant in the Placa Catalunya. For fast food -Pans and Sandwich & Friends were great places for sandwiches, fries etc. Barcelona is not the best place for vegetarians but if you go to the La Boqueria market, it sells fresh fruit and fresh bread which is a real treat for all the senses. It opens really early as all the locals shop there but remember it is closed on Sundays. Do not miss the bus tour conducted by Bus Touristic - excellent way to see the city, hop on & off as you please, but arrive early to make sure you get onto the top deck for a good view.

The hotel is in an ideal spot just north of Placa de Catalunya through which you need to cross to reach La Rambla and the waterfront. We arrived in Barcelona mid-evening following a Ryanair flight from Bournemouth to Genoa and caught the Barcelona bus directly to the city. The bus station in Barcelona at which this particular bus terminates is a good 20 minutes walk from the hotel and we were lucky we only had small bags and a good map as we didn\u2019t want to take a taxi. The hotel lobby is ornate with a central large wrought iron staircase and balustrade beyond which is a very small bar leading into the restaurant. The Xmas tree was beautiful and the decorations very discreet. Our room was large and looked over a car park towards the back of the hotel \u2013 not particularly pretty but certainly nothing to complain about. We were fortunately on the fourth floor, too high to be disturbed by the rumble of the metro as mentioned by previous reviewers, but we could hear it during breakfast. Breakfast was included in the room rate and as the hotel was not particularly busy during our stay two weeks before Xmas there were only ever half a dozen other tables occupied at breakfast. The buffet was very impressive, the eggs and other cooked dishes piping hot, with a large selection of cereals, pastries, cold meats etc. There is so much to see in Barcelona that three days is barely enough time to take in all the sights. We bought a ticket for the hop-on-hop-off bus that was valid for two days. Although it was quite expensive, it was essential if you wanted to see all the sights as Barcelona is quite a sprawling city. The bus takes two separate routes (northerly and southerly) and we took one on each day. The northerly route takes you through the Passeig de Gracia, where we took photos of stunning Gaudi buildings and then up to Parc Guell which was well worth the stop for a couple of hours with its stunning views over the city. The southern route travels out to Montjuic and the Olympic Stadium and then along to the waterside. Our favourite areas of the city were Barcelonetta and El Born (La Ribera) full of narrow alleys and local restaurants. La Rambla was fine for an evening stroll but the southern end towards the water became a little tatty with a few strip joints and prostitutes.

There was coffee on my floor, near the elevators, in the morning and snacks in the afternoon. The bed was firm, just the way I like it.

A little later we gave him the promised remaninder of the tip him. However: this experience was very hurtful and we were uncomfortable in the hotel for our 3 days. The maid service was once a day and our room was not always clean. The vacuuming was not done the whole time and table/nightstands were not always wiped down. The front desk was fine and helpful.

It was really rude service for a four-star hotel.", "Date": "June 14, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Taunton", "Title": "\u201cComfortable surroundings in a good location\u201d", "Author": "TripadviserTaunton", "ReviewID": "UR5018219", "Content": "A good standard 4 star hotel in a central location where an impressive reception and lounge area provides the central focus. The appearance is of a well maintained establishment and rooms are very comfortable and of reasonable size. Whilst, situated as we were on the 8th floor, we found it to be very quiet, I would think that lower down you may be more conscious of traffic noise. Rooms come with a decent size bathroom but it appears a little dated. Breakfast buffet was adequate but with a very limited range of hot offerings. The evening buffet is probably the one to miss as it is not particularly cheap and food was luke warm at best. Much better alternatives outside where the hotel is in close proximity to some good restaurants. Staff were very helpful throughout and overall we regarded ourselves to have been fortunate to have found this good city hotel.", "Date": "April 29, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, California", "Title": "\u201cPleasant Stay\u201d", "Author": "parisqueen04", "ReviewID": "UR4976546", "Content": "I spent two nights at this superior deluxe property.

The food that is served in the restaurant is expensive but not so much on the room service. My accomodations were standard with a small view of the city.The room was very clean as was the large bathroom.

It was very poor value for the rates it charges. It is obvious that most of the investment at this hotel has been made in the lobby - mostly in marble. However, not much has happened in the rooms. The bathroom was relatively new, and had good water pressure (which we had at all the hotels we stayed at). However, the bedroom area could definitely use some updating. The mattress must have been there since the hotel was built 50 years ago. Both my husband and I accidentally fell off the bed because we sat too close to the edge. The colors are all dreary and rather depressing to be around. Friends staying at the hotel had a number of exciting experiences, ranging from showers that didn't work to a room that smelled REALLY bad.

Throughout our stay there was only one lift working and trips to and from the 8th floor could take a long time. Breakfast was excellent but the staff needed constant prompting to replenish the buffet, particularly with the outstanding scrambled eggs. One hidden asset - we developed the habit of nightcaps on return to the hotel at night. The seemingly high-priced drinks turned out to be a bargain as they were served in enormous tumblers! The waiting staff and concierges were bright and helpful but the reception staff were rather more taciturn although pleasant enough.
