After reading the reviews, and travelling for a couple weeks and staying in hostels, we weren't expecting much. We were even warming up to the idea of an open shower, as we read from some of the other reviews of the this place. We got in by train at the Termini Station and the WRH Suites were conveniently located a 5 minutes walk away. Checking in was kind of tricky. I believe we had to go to the 5th floor to check in but our room was actually on the 3rd floor. WRH owns 2 floors at the other floor is another hotel. When we got to our room, it was absolutely luxury! There was a queen bed with fresh linens, marble flooring, pretty drapes, a flatscreen TV, and breakfast laid out. The bathroom was equally as nice; everything was updated and the shower...oh the shower was the best part. Instead of the usual spout it was a circular faucet with streams of water shooting you in a circle on your head. Which seems weird now that I've typed it out...but it was AMAZING. Beyond that, everything in the suite was super clean--and I'm somewhat OCD about cleanliness. The location of this hotel is great. Because you're right next to Termini, you can easily take public transportation. The only thing is, the station can get a little sketchy at night.", "Date": "November 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGood, well priced and centrally located Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Paul M", "ReviewID": "UR119939286", "Content": "We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights and we enjoyed our stay. The negatives were: 1. The room - our booked room smelled like an ashtray as the previous guest clearly was a smoker. We changed rooms as a result. 2. The shower - in our original room was right in the middle of the room and did not have a shower curtain or frosted door.... 3. The Metro - a streetcar runs right past the hotel, starting as early as 6am; not that we wanted to sleep all day while in Rome, however an unrequested 6am wake-up call wasn't the way we liked to start our days. The positives were: 1. Location - this place is a 5 minute walk from the Roma Termini (train station) and is also located right across the street from a police station; a very central and safe location. 2. The Staff - both guys working at the front desk were very knowledgeable about Rome, and very accommodating when it came to things like checkout and holding our luggage etc. 3. The Elevator - while not the biggest or fastest hotel elevator I have ever been in, it just had that \"european\" feel to it. 4. The Price - Rome is not cheap, the city and with the Euro exchange rates. This hotel cost us $150 Euro a night. When walking around, we stopped into the Best Western nearby to check their rates, and the cheapest they had was $200 Euro a night. Upon a return to Rome, I would consider this place again.", "Date": "October 31, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cGood, basic and centrally located Rome apartment.\u201d", "Author": "bearrrwillie", "ReviewID": "UR118151956", "Content": "We stayed in one of the the WRH one bedroom apartments, there is a small lift as reception is on the 4th floor. First, off I have to highlight to any first time visitors, Rome is not a cheap city for the tourist. I am convinced there are tourist prices and local prices. If you speak Italian, use it I think it will save you money. These apartments compared to the Roman Hotel prices we were offered on line, gave very good value for money. The fridge and kitchenette saw significant savings on food, drink and eating out, which can be pricey in Rome. Example; 6 soops of albeit, very nice ice cream between 3 people was Euro 18.00 about \u00a316.00 Sterling! Check out the wine in the supermarkets, a very nice Merlot for 5 Euro! Andrea on the small reception, was very friendly and welcoming. He met us at the elevator and helped with our bags. The check in was quick, despite all the Italian paper work and we were allowed in the apartment, on arrival at 12 noon. The apartment was basically suitable for the money paid, but could have been so much better with some simple improvements. A coat of fresh paint, removing of some of the very dated furnishings and some better cleaning would have given this place a good rating, instead of average. We think the turn around on our arrival and the previous guests leaving, saw some corner cutting on the cleaning. The bathroom was very clean and the bedding and towels all fresh, however the kitchen area and floors were not cleaned well enough. They failed to spot what looked like an exploded Coke bottle in the freezer. Although in itself not 'dirty' it looked rather horrible on inspection and should have been cleaned up. The apartment was fully air conditioned in the bedroom and living room and believe me this was needed in the August heat, some days up to 38C (100F?). It was a split air con system so very quiet, which was needed as our apartment faced a street with a tram / light rail that started most mornings about 0530. Even with the double glazed windows, it was rather loud. Myself and another party member have no trouble using ear plugs, so it did not bother us. Another party member slept through it without ear plugs, so the noise levels, effects people to different degrees. All the other basics were there and worked well, including the good WiFi service. Italian TV is simply appalling, so did not bother with it. There was always hot water and additional toiletries that were needed were provided on request. The bedding was adequate, but not luxurious. Excluding the tram, there was not too much other ambient noise, other than what you would expect from a large apartment building in a busy city central location and not anything that bothered any of us. The location is one of the big selling points here. It is just two short blocks from Termini Station and is very easy to find and well labelled with a distinctive name plaque on the doorway. It is within a 20-30 minute walk or less of many of the big tourist hotspots. We walked in the heat to the Trevi, Spanish Steps, Colosseum and Pantheon. By the way please take a couple of evening walks, the city is particularly lovely on those warm balmy Summer nights. The Trevi and Colosseum are just spectacular at night! The area is well serviced by restaurants and shops of all kinds. The apartment building is a block from the Church, Santa Maria Maggorie, and from the other side of the Church you can pick up several tour buses. We opted for the 'Cristiana' Tour company (yellow coloured bus livery) as they had an awning on their 'open topped' bus that shaded you from the blazing Summer sun. They also offered a two for one deal with the Sistine Chapel, Vatican Museum entry ticket and a 48 hour step on and off bus ticket, for 42 Euro which seemed a good deal to us. There is also a supermarket just opposite the front of the church that proved very useful. The bottom line is, this is centrally located basic, in need of some cosmetic improvements, apartment and it delivers value for money. We paid about Euro 600 between 3 people for 5 nights. If your looking for a bit of luxury, give this place a miss. However, we would stay there again.", "Date": "September 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cNot as nice as the pictures look\u201d", "Author": "mb25b", "ReviewID": "UR116237171", "Content": "The location was really good - close to restaurants, the train station and other transportation to get around the city.

On top of this, the bathtub and the sink are really very close from the bed; and when you sell a room for 3, they should tell you that there is no real bathroom, but shower/bathtub in the room! It is dirty and bad smells (and dark water) come out from the bathtub. Noise from the street, but worse from the trains until late in the night and very early in the morning, do not let you sleep well, furthermore when the heating system does not work well and you freeze at night in autumn ... what shall it be in winter? last but not least, the food left for \"breakfast\" is not worth this wording and the space for breakfast is dirty and boiling stuff doesn't work.

It was literally two minutes walk from the train station. The staff contacted me before I travelled and they waited until I arrived which was quite late. Although it was late when I arrived, it was a safe walk from the train station and the hotel was right by a police station for added security. I stayed in this hotel twice during my stay in Italy and tried two different rooms, both were very modern looking, clean and spacious. The rooms also came with a laptop and free wireless internet which was very useful and meant that I didn't need to bring a laptop with me. Both the double rooms I stayed in had jacuzzi baths with were very nice after tiring days sightseeing. The reception staff were very very helpful and friendly and could give you advice on location of places. They also looked after my bag on the check out day until I was ready to collect my bag and start my trip home. It's a small hotel with only a few rooms, so you are provided with a nice breakfast basket which was sufficient and there is a shared kitchen area too. The location by the train station meant that it was easy access for the airport, easy access to the tourist buses which depart by the train station and easy access for a day trip to Pompeii which also left by the train station. It took me about 15-20 minutes to walk from the hotel to the Colosseum and the Foro Romano and it was quite an easy direct walk, although I did also buy one of those tourist bus passes which made it easy to see the sights and get around Rome and easy to get back to the hotel as the bus stopped by the train station.

A laptop with internet connection is provided in the room, which turned out to be very useful to check the weather forecast and even make ticket reservations. They also offer free WiFi access if you bring your own laptop or smartphone. The cleaning of the room is good, but other maintenance can be improved, I think. There were som little defects, such as a not working lamp and some spots around the bath where the paint was damaged. Although these things do not make a stay unpleasant, I did not expect it at this price range. As stated on their website, breakfast is not included, although some biscuits are provided, as well as coffee pads that can be used in the coffee machine in the shared kitchenette. In the kitchenette are also a microwave and an electric cooking plate that can be used free of charge. Personally, I did not really miss an included breakfast. There is a good coffee shop around the corner where you can grab an Italian breakfast. (Coffee with some sweet bread, like a sweet croissant or \"Cornetto\". It's cheap if you eat it standing at the bar.) The reception is not manned 24 hours, but there is a list of phone numbers that can be called for emergencies.

We were completely blown away by this to start with, and the room was perfect as well. We followed his advice and had an amazing time. The rooms were tidy, modern, and provided a cool respite from the blazing summer heat. In addition, the location to city transport was ideal.

After coming up empty on finding accommodations every place we looked, the WRH Suites did have an opening. We booked the room and hoped for the best. Upon arrival, we learned that there was a problem. A man staying there had lost his passport and couldn't leave due to the fact that the Embassy had to use the hotel as his contact address. So they told us that we would be staying at this location for one night, but would need to move to their location on the other side of the Termini for the next night. We were disappointed that we would have to pack up and move again, but glad to help someone in need who had lost their passport. We were able to leave our suitcases at the second place in the morning, and they put them in the room after it was cleaned. In the first room, we were very relieved to find that it was clean and stylish. There was a laptop provided with internet access, a television, and a kitchen area down the hall for making coffee, etc. The only drawback here was that the bed was very close to the floor in height, giving the feeling of nearly sleeping on the floor. Anyone who may have trouble getting up from a low position might have trouble getting out of the bed. Not sure if all the beds at this location are low, however. In the second room where we stayed on the other side of Termini, the room was much larger. The bed was a normal height. Again, a laptop was provided for the internet, and there was a television and a kitchen area just outside the room door. The bathroom was bigger as well with a huge shower. The only problem we encountered here was that someone tried to enter our room with a key after I turned off the light and got in bed which caused quite a fright. I'm not sure if someone just got the wrong door or what was going on. However, I screamed and the person stopped trying the door and walked away.

Within three minutes of receiving confirmation of my booking, I received an email from Tomaso asking me relevant questions and giving me advice on arrival. When I replied, I got another, more personalized reply within a few minutes as well. The hotel is located two blocks from the Termini train station in central Rome. It's easily walkable from the station, and the walk, with all our luggage felt quite safe on a sunny afternoon. There is a button outside with the name of the hotel on it, and when we pressed it we were delighted to hear Tomaso ask for us by name. When you have only four rooms, you know who is likely to press the bell. We made it up the rickety elevator and the room was not ready (as we had been warned it would not be). But instead of being told to drop our luggage and come back, Tomaso took us to the breakfast room, gave us great Italian coffee and cookies, and sat us down with a map of Rome. He showed us all the sites we would want to see, drew the bus lines and Metro lines we would want to take to get there. Then he drew little boxes for recommended restaurants, with descriptions of each and when we would be likely want to go there. His restaurant recommendations (except one was closed for lunch on Sunday so were on our own) proved to be excellent; we had great Roman pasta and perfect pizza at reasonable prices. But his best recommendation was this, \"Get lost in Rome.\" With his map, and a little bump of geography, he suggested we could have no better time than to wander streets aimlessly. Again, he was right. The room was small but functional. The wireless internet worked perfectly (and there is a laptop if you don't have one). The refrigerator was great to have, and the free and endless snacks and coffee and juice were wonderful. The bed was fine, the bathroom small but fine, and the view across the street was \"typical Rome.\" They were remodelling the building and the way the door opens is a little weird, but all in all we could not have had a better experience in Rome.", "Date": "January 13, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "chipsambos", "Title": "\u201cnice spot to stay\u201d", "Author": "chipsambos", "ReviewID": "UR11478712", "Content": "Close to Termini train station.

He told us how to take the subway or bus to the places further away, and marked all this on the map in relation to the hotel. He gave us his phone # as well as some other #s of people that also help run the apartment, in case we needed anything beyond the hours that he would be present at the front desk. (He informed us ahead of time too exactly when someone would be there) We liked having our own key to the apartment to come and go as we pleased. We found we didn't need assistance beyond the breakfast hours. Speaking of breakfast, we enjoyed the freshly made cappucinos. So perfect!! He shared with us his way of frothing the milk and it made us determined to go home and work on our own technique. There was fruit, toast, ham, cheese, rolls, and danishes, also juice and bottled water. We walked to everything, the colleseum, spanish steps, pantheon, etc. We were happy to burn off all the pasta we ate!! We didn't feel unsafe near the Termini station, and just tried to blend in and not show uncertainty or fear. But we stayed alert, nonetheless, having been warned by travel books, travellers, and even this site, we tried to know where we were going before we left the apartment, and if we got lost, discreetly checked our map to get our bearings.

The bathroom is superb and modern and the great touches as the flat satellite tv and computer with free internet access are incredible. When I booked this hotel trough their website I was afraid that maybe it will be too modern for my mother but she just loved it!!! Trust me everithing is as nice as it looks in the website Breakfast is fine, with cold cuts, yoghurt, juice, fruit and bread and the nice breakfast lady will prepare toast and capuccino for you. Breakfast room is also modern and bright. Right now this is a GREAT value in Rome in terms of what you pay and what you receive, wich is an axcellent retreat in a beautiful but chaotic city.

Upon arrival, we were told that they could not give us the room we had asked, because otherwise the other room (the one we were given) would have been empty for too many days, or some excuse of the sort. The room we got had two single beds which they pushed together. It was dissapointing, especially since the decoration was not the one we were hoping for.

It was particularly useful when we wanted to browse and find restaurant or shop addresses. A definite plus!!! The service was nice. The people at the desk are pleasant and are willing to give you directions or organize reservations, etc. for you if you need them to.

We asked if we could leave our luggage until the middle of the afternoon, but the guy at the desk told us that it was his day off, and that he had only come to make us check out.

We didn't do much on our last day in Rome, because we had already wasted so much time with the luggage, and then we were scared it would take us as long to be able to get it back, so we got to the train station really early so as not to miss the bus... and then our plane!

We tried most of them and they were all very good. The only question about the place is its location. If you, like us, plan to walk all day in Rome, then the hotel is not situated such that you can take a mid-day rest, unless you take public transportation back to it (we walked from it to most places, except the Vatican where you can take the subway). Other than that I would certainly recommend it.", "Date": "May 10, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne, Australia", "Title": "\u201cBellisimo\u201d", "Author": "1Princessa", "ReviewID": "UR4933895", "Content": "Im pretty fussy about where I stay so after weeks of searching for a reasonably priced hotel in central Rome (very difficult), I settled on the WRH Suites. I spent three nights there in the twin/double room which to be honest is quite small but I was hardly ever in it so it didnt worry me at all. Its located about 3 minutes from Termini which is handy for the Metro/Bus and about 10 -15 minutes walk to the Forum/Colleseum and a further 5-10 mintues to Piazza Navona and the Spanish Steps etc. The immediate area the front of the station is a little dodgy but nothing to worry about at all. To get to the hotel you literally walk out the front of the train station, turn left, walk straight over the road where the shops are. There is a man on the corner selling fruit and vegetables and that is the street you walk down. Its number 69 so just follow the numbers and its across the road from a sports store. My room was really modern, clean, had air conditioning, 100's of tv channels to watch, internet access and was really quiet thanks to the double glazed shutters. The maid even folded my pyjamas up every day and put them on my pillow. At night there is a bar called the Druids Rock about 3 minutes walk going in the opposite direction to the station. Its a cheesy Irish bar full of tourists but handy for a drink on the way home from a busy days sight seeing. I wouldnt worry about missing breakfast in the morning, it was basically bran flakes, a couple of different cheese's and a couple of pastries. One day we were lucky enough to be given toast but the next day there was a different lady there and she couldnt even work the coffee machine let alone make toast. Its not a big deal as there are plenty of places near by to pick up breakfast or grab a slice of pizza. Overall I would highly recommend it and would definitely stay there again. Just remember to bring comfy shoes with you as my calf muscles and feet have never ached so much after 3 days of solid walking.", "Date": "April 5, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brisbane, Australia", "Title": "\u201cDeserves to be well known!\u201d", "Author": "gk", "ReviewID": "UR4628119", "Content": "I stayed at the WRH suites based on two things - a few positive reviews on Tripadvisor and the photograps on their website. All I can say is, my expectations were met and greatly exceeded mostly by the pleasant staff who would bend over backwards to help you out. We arrived on a late train on saturday night, but Tomaso was there to greet us and pick out all the great spots for us to visit as well as a few restaurant recommendations. He was even kind enough to call us when we hadn't shown up in time just to make sure we were on the right track! The room we stayed in was the Junior Suite and it was simply stunning. Modern, clean, spacious - perfect! It's also a lot bigger than it looks like on the website. The jacuzzi was an absolute godsend. Like somebody else said, after a day's walking around Rome, it was the perfect end to the day to spend a bit of time in there! There was an computer connected to the internet provided (very helpful!) an in-room safe, phone, lots of storage space and a mini-bar as well. The breakfast at the WRH Suites was also excellent with fresh brioches, toast, ham, cheese, fruits, yoghurt, cereal and someone there to make you a hot cup of coffee. Lovely! We found the location to be excellent - we caught the buses or the metro everywhere in Rome and Termini station was a 2 minute walk away. If you're having trouble finding the place, here's a tip: walk to the very end of the Station Termini where it meets the Piazza Cinquecento. This is the outside area where all the buses and taxis congregate. Once you're outside, turn to your left to face via G. Giolitti. There is a row of shops set back from the normal run of shops and the first street on the left is the one WRH Suites is on - via D. Manin. You'll also recognise it because it has tram tracks running down it. So, if you start from just outside Termini station, you should have no trouble finding it. I wouldn't hesitate in recommending this hotel to any other travellers in Rome. It's close to transport links, stylish, friendly and good value.", "Date": "March 17, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fort Worth, Texas", "Title": "\u201cHidden Gem, But Not For Everyone\u201d", "Author": "2BAnonymous", "ReviewID": "UR4626416", "Content": "My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed our recent three-night stay at the WRH Suites (a.k.a., Arthouse Rome). We were warmly received upon our arrival - even given coffee and breakfast - and allowed into our room much earlier than we expected. We were very pleased with what we found... The junior suite was just as their website represented - contemporary in styling, clean and comfortable. Having a laptop with a highspeed connection was a brilliant touch. And even better, its use is free (handy for daily checking weather and researching the area). The staff is very friendly, approachable and quick to offer assistance. Shortly after our arrival, we had already been given a map and a few suggestions to make the most of our Rome experience. Assistance was even given for arranging hard to come by museum tickets. Now that is good service. I would recommend paying for your stay in cash. The discount given - almost 10% - is too good to pass up. Now for the part that makes the WRH Suites not for everyone: since this a boutique hotel and not a large, fully-staffed operation, it will not appeal to the traveler that likes to walk into a large and active lobby and have a staff at your disposal 24 hours a day. Instead, you are given keys to the building and the hotel and your comings and goings are more self-directed. We had absolutely no issue with this (as it was clearly stated on their website), but I recognize that this will not work for everyone. [In fairness, too, emergency numbers for the staff are provided so if something were to come up you would not be on your own.] Also, the walk up to the building is not all that great and the lobby of the building could use a fresh coat of paint. The small nits aside, the WRH Suites is a reasonably-priced oasis in a convenient location only a short walk to the Termini station and no more than 20 minutes by foot to most attractions. It is perfect for the independently-minded traveler. We would definitely stay here each time we return to Rome.", "Date": "March 16, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cExcellent\u201d", "Author": "sinyc", "ReviewID": "UR4624396", "Content": "Just came back from spending 5 nights at WRH Suites.
