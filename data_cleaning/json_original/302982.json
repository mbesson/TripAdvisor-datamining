{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Wonderful location but the service let it down This is a review of 2 halves!The positive is that the location and view are absolutely outstanding and the villa is huge!! We had a large private infinity pool overlooking the Ayung river valley - so beautiful and peaceful. The villa was very large with a large sunken bath and in and outdoors showers. The not so positive... The service, although everybody smiled they all seemed a little vacant! Having come from a hotel on the coast there really was something missing. They didn't seem to really care which would normally not matter too much but when you are on honeymoon and have paid a significant sum to stay here you expect a little more! The other thing that started to grate was the additional cost i.e. there was a free shuttle into Ubud but it only ran at 4 times a day at inconvenient times so then to get the shuttle when you actually wanted to go it would cost $8 US dollars each each way to give this some context a local taxi would only set you back $2 each each way! It isn't the end of the world we just used the local taxis when we could but it kind of took the shine of off the place.We ended up describing the Wulandari as a once magnificent hotel that has now lost its sparkle... it needs a bit of love!!", "Date": "Aug 8, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR735163814", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "twoonetwo"}, {"Content": "Complete Relaxation       The lobby area... they take your picture on the way in and every staff member knows you by name.", "Date": "Jun 10, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR775201154", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "BBowden"}, {"Content": "Heavenly My wife and I stayed here for 3 nights as part of our honeymoon in October. We had first stayed for 2 nights in Seminyak so the first thing you notice when arriving here is the change in climate. It's a lot cooler and pleasant up here compared to the coast, which was extremely welcoming. It also means there are less mosquitos to bother you.We arranged for transport from the hotel to pick us up from Seminyak. The driver was friendly and made the long drive easy. When we got to Ubud, he pointed out the landmarks in the town so that we could get our orientation, even pointing out restaurants that we could try. The hotel itself amazing, in a very understated and non commercial way. Driving up the driveway, you see rice paddies and countryside. The entrance and check in area are open and very luxurious with the marble floor and high thatch roof.All of the villas are built into the slope of the gorge. So although the distances are small, the gradient gets you. Luckily there are golf carts that can get you around. We got one of the villas quite close to the main pool and restaurant, so walking was not a problem.The villa itself is breathtaking. Nothing prepares you, as you enter through the private gate and outdoor dining area, for the majestical view of the gorge and rainforest. It's one of those backdrops that will stay in your memories for life. Each villa has an private infinity pool where you can swim, relax and gaze over the forest. Inside the villa, the furnishing are luxurious but fitting for the surroundings, nothing seems out of place with the serenity of the surroundings.During our stay, we hired one of the vans from the hotel for a half day trip to local attractions. We had some idea of where to go, and the driver was knowledgable and helpful, taking us to craft villages, local temples and area attractions (Elephant jungle, volcano). We also ventured into Ubud for an evening to try the local cuisine. The hotel was very quiet, we never saw any other guests. For one of our evenings, we had a private dinner for 2 at the restaurant, and it was as if we were the only people in Bali. They had laid out petals and orchids all over the ground leading to our table, truly magical and romantic.For other meals, you can have meals brought to your dining area in the villa. It was a pleasure to stay here, the service was excellent and our stay was perfect.", "Date": "Apr 30, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR217240916", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "telmacbrit"}, {"Content": "We had a great time!!!

Our accomodation was fabulous and the views of the gorge were stunning. The villas are very private, accessed through a lockable arched wooden door through a stone wall. The villa's covered pavilion; with a comfortable sofa, dining table and chairs, refrigerator, and fish pond; was a great place to have breakfast. The infinity plunge pool, although beautiful, was not heated and a bit too chilly in the cool mountain rain. I enjoyed reading under the covered awning next to it, however, looking out over the gorge. The large bathroom is a dream, with outdoor shower and picture windowed sunken bath.The restaurant and public pool area are lovely. We did not eat in the restaurant because we hardly saw anyone else there at night and did not want to be the only customers. I think maybe prices and location are part of the problem. The breakfast, included with our room rate, was delicious.I nearly rated this hotel as excellent, except that the hotel is about 20 minutes drive from Ubud and the hotel charges for its shuttle service. We didn't mind paying, although we were uncomfortable with the manner in the heavy-handed (multiple-staffed) manner in which we were approached for payment. Considering how expensive it is to stay at this hotel, it might be wiser to offer this service as a measure of good will and maybe encourage more people to stay there. The hotel was very quiet when we stayed. There were 1 or 2 other off-putting experiences with some of the staff, although the majority of the time we felt very pampered.The hotel shop and library were never open when we checked, even during their posted hours.

We (I!) booked the 3 night Spa package and was not able to negotiate a discount vs. the advertised price.

My wife and I have stayed at some of the finest resorts in the world including the Aman Resorts, Lizard Island, Fregate Private, Post Ranch Inn among others.

We stayed there for five days in late Sept 2004Each of the 36 bungalows has its own plunge pool, two-person tub, separate shower, walk-in closets, and a picture perfect view of the terraced rice paddies. The hotel spa is awesome with some of the best treatments we've had anywhere. The complimentary breakfast and afternoon tea service that is delivered to your room is only part of the exquisite experience. The restaurants were a little quiet, but served excellent food. There are also lots of nearby restaurants at other Hotels within a five minute cab ride or in Ubud which is about twelve minutes away.Jon Makmaltchi of Small Luxury Hotels told us about Puri Wulandara and raved about the place. I was a little apprehensive as it was only 1/3rd the price of the Amandari down the street (near Ubud in Bali). Jon was right on the mark.
