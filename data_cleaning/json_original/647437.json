I normally am set on one hotel but they have not only increased their rates but there has been very little maintenance. I was looking for an alternative hotel and surfed the net. I selected the Rose Garden Bur Dubai and talked to the staff and the Manager, Mr Abdul Azeez. They made me comfortable for me to 'risk' making a move from my regular hotel. On my arrival, past midnight, I found the staff pretty alert and welcomed us with a smile and a fresh juice drink, There was some misunderstanding regarding the room. The Front Desk called the Manager (past midnight) to get the matter resolved. The Manager, Mr Abdul Azeez was very accommodating and a thorough gentlemen and the issue was resolved to the satisfaction of both parties. The staff were very helpful, polite and friendly during our stay. The rooms are cleaned daily and spotless. The Wi Fi router in each room was very essential and complimentary whereas in other hotels they would normally charge between Dhs 25-50 per day. The location is fantastic with Bur Juman Shopping Mall across the road, and Restaurants and Cafes and the metro within a few minutes walk. You cannot ask for a better location Overall the hotel exceeded our expectations and we intend to use the Rose Gardens Bur Dubai as our 'regular' hotel for future visits to Dubai We would highly recommend this hotel to all who read this review and further we will recommend it to our friends all over the world G M S London", "Date": "March 16, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hong Kong", "Title": "\u201cBook in advance and got a good price\u201d", "Author": "Siumee", "ReviewID": "UR126042085", "Content": "We and our friends were upgraded from Studio to One Bedroom Apt. (Rm 307 & 404) which were very nice. Room 404 looked like newly furnished. But Room 307 was a bit dated, especially the bath tub. The apartments are very large and comfortable. Slippers and Hairdryers need to borrow from the counter. It took quite long to have them. WiFi is fast. But is only available in bedroom. Staff services are acceptable. Location of the hotel is very good. Very convenient to go to many attractions. It takes only a 10-15 min walk to the Creek. A Metro station is within 300 meters. Burjuman Mall is just a block away. If you want to take a taxi, go to the main entrance of Burjuman Mall where there are always a lot of taxis waiting. The bell boy took 20 min. to hire a taxi for us near the hotel when we went to the airport. We book 3 months in advance from the Hotels website and got a very good price. It can be booked with any currency, but remember to pay in AED. Their exchange rate spread is very high.", "Date": "March 13, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lund, Sweden", "Title": "\u201cGood option for family travellers\u201d", "Author": "MariaS829", "ReviewID": "UR125517144", "Content": "Nice and friendly staff, great, quiet location.

Our stay was originally for three nights but our travel plans changed. The hotel staff was exceptionally flexible and accommodating to our ever changing needs. Everyone on the staff was highly professional and went above and beyond for all our demands. One night we had a party with some friends and the hotel was more than accommodating. The rooms are nice and spacious. We have friends who live in the Bur Dubai area and did research and found that this hotel has the largest rooms for the price. Conveniently located one block from Burjuman Mall, for our needs and what we were doing in Dubai this apartment was centrally located and close to the metro. Free wifi in each apartment, the dishes was adequate, and cookware was fine (don\u2019t expect to be able to cook for a large party). One bedroom has place setting for four people and two bedroom has a place setting for six. Parking is free but very tight and figuring out how to get to the hotel by driving can be difficult at first. Conveniently, there\u2019s a store and pharmacy three blocks away. If you try to get a taxi, you\u2019ll have better luck walking close to the Burjuman. I would recommend a family or a married couple to stay here as the area is very quiet.
