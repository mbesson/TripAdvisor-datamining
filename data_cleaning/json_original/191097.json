Breakfast was adequate and we enjoyed the roof deck. The young woman who managed the breakfast room did a great job. The location was fabulous; we walked to all the major sights. Our room was quiet and we slept well. I give this hotel three stars because of its location but I do not recommend this hotel to honeymooners. It is fine for people who want to stay in the center of Rome for cheap but it's not worth even the 200E a night. The Bad: Upon arrival, the young man at the front desk was cold, disinterested and unwelcoming. Our room was by far the worst of our honeymoon; small, dark, lacked a safe and the toilet did not flush. On our way to lunch, we told the desk clerk about the toilet; when we returned, he said he had fixed the toilet. Our toilet still did not flush. I called the front desk several times; no answer. I went downstairs to inquire about the toilet and the clerk told me with a smirk that there was nothing he could do about the toilet; he would call a plumber in the morning and we\u2019d have to deal with it until then. I asked if we could move to a room with a working toilet and perhaps a safe. He said that no rooms had safes and no rooms were available. I told him that I was on my honeymoon and refused to accept a room without a working toilet. This young man was sarcastic, snippy, rude, sighing, rolling his eyes... He finally told us we could move to the special room for one night but we would have to move again in the morning. We lugged our bags up to the fourth floor and within minutes he called to say we had to move again. He has \u201csuddenly\u201d found us another room with a working toilet and a safe too. The walls of the new room were covered in orange velour and the curtains were orange too but at least the room was slightly less dark and depressing than the first room. I would like to note that the young desk clerk was the rudest person I have EVER come across in a hotel \u2013 the older gentlemen who also worked the desk were pleasant enough. Also, the marble stairs in the hotel are very slippery and I slipped and hurt my forearm.

It would have been nice to have room for 2 chairs (instead of just 1) so that we didn\u2019t have to sit on the bed all the time. Our room had individually controlled AC which was very welcome since it was in the mid 80\u2019s while we were there. We loved the power awning control \u2013 hadn\u2019t seen that anywhere before.

Most of the reviews have pretty well summed up the situation--nice rooms that are, mostly, not huge, but well appointed. A location that permits a leisurely walk of say 8 minutes to Piazza Navona or the Pantheon; walkable to the Vatican, and Castel San Angelo, and fairly close to some important bus lines. The street is narrow and quiet for the most part--horn honking has really diminished in Rome over the past ten years. There are adequate restaurants nearby and some very fine ones as well. The Portuguese national church is next door and is a gem. Watch for concerts and recitals there--very interesting mixes of traditional and modern classical music. The included breakfast is served on the top floor which includes an open air area in nice weather. The food selection is fine and the only point to be made is to know that toward the end of the service hours food is not replenished and the door is shut on the dot of closing. There are a few points which will not cause concern for most visitors, but it should be noted that while there is an elevator, it is reached by walking up two steps from the lobby. Also, it does NOT give access to the breakfast room, and that involves climbing a flight of stairs. As someone who occasionally has mobility issues, I think this could be significant for some folks. The staff are, for the most part, friendly and helpful. There are lockable safes in the room. Internet is available on a computer in the lobby--for which I think there is a charge. I had my own laptop and paid a fee for access. It is sold on basis of set number of hours and can be carried over from day to day. As in many Italilan hotels, the AC is centrally controlled or the thermostats are not offering much discretion. The weather was ok while we were there and we were able to keep our room comfortable, but I suspect during a hot spell, that the cooling is relative only to what is going on outside. But, if you want cool, come to Seattle! We think the Portoghesi is a great hotel for visitors who are familiar with Rome, but not a bad 'first stop on first visit\" place either. It does not boast luxuries, but offers comfort, quiet and convenience. One overall tip--at least this past June, regular taxis offered a set rate to the FCO airport of, I think, 40 Euros--to which we added a 10 Euro trip for an especially fine driver whom we had engaged before. The hotel will set up a car to the airport, but I seem to recall that their charge was 60 Euros.", "Date": "July 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Carlisle, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel in perfect location\u201d", "Author": "CHL44", "ReviewID": "UR115589858", "Content": "We stayed here at the beginning and end of our Italy vacation for a total of 5 nights.

We sat upstairs on the terrace every night to have a glass or two of wine before heading out for the evening and usually had it to ourselves. The breakfast every morning was just fine, the coffe was great, the other guests all smiled at breakfast and we chatted with other English speakers (which was probably less than a quarter of the guests). The bathroom in our room (where we moved after the second night...or actually they did the moving, we just left everything in the apartment and they moved it all into our original room) was small, but so has been every bathroom in every hotel in which we have ever stayed in Europe.

We booked this hotel on the back of the many excellent reviews (\" favourite hotel in Rome etc\" ), and on the back of which we were left feeling disappointed. The key here is that this is not really a hotel in the UK understanding of the term. 100% factually what you get ( noting that we stayed in a double room - 2 twin beds - and not a suite ) is a smallish, but clean room, basic but has obviously been refurbished in the last few years. You get a decent breakfast on the roof terrace, and the staff are very friendly. If you want to be right in the thick of things then location is excellent, being literally 200 yards from top of piazza navona. That however is it. Once breakfast is over, then you can't as much as order a beer or a bottle of water ( there is no bar ), no fridge or coffee/tea making facilities in the room, and the roof terrace isn't high enough for a view so no point sitting there later on. If you are happy with this, and this is what you're looking for, then as said this is a perfectly adequate B&B in an excellent location. If however you're looking for a bit more then this won't be for you. Personally we would have preferred somewhere with a few more facilities, so that after walking about for hrs, it would be a pleasant place to spend a couple of hrs to relax, prior to heading out again. If we went back in the future, I think we'd stay in a larger hotel in Travestere with a pool, so that could have a bit of time chilling out at the start and end of the day. Taxis are plentiful and cheap, so staying 10mins out of the centro storico really wouldn't be a problem.

Nothing else was needed: the house antipasti was ample (grilled eggplant, tomato wedges, fried mozzarella balls, a fresh mozzarella ball, melon and proscuitto, meatballs, a bowl of warm cannellini beans in sauce, etc.), and the house red was smooth and fine. (David at the front desk said they're famous for their antipasti.) Nearby also is a mozzarrella bar, Obika, that David recommended; it has a contemporary feel and plays soft jazz.

A narrow passageway leads to the lift which is also very small; can accommodate three adults with no luggage or maybe two with a bit of luggage. The lift was pretty old as well but again this added to the character. We had chosen to stay in the Le Torre (Tower) which is what they call their 'superior suite'. I did expect it to be a little larger as suites in SA are pretty roomy, but by Rome standards, it was fine. It consisted of the main bedroom with double bed, television, internet facility, dressing table. Through some double doors, there was an interleading bedroom which had one single bed. Off the interleading bedroom was the bathroom. This may present a problem if the people staying there were friends and not family but it was fine for us. The bathroom was very roomy and had a good sized shower, sink, toilet and bidet. There was also a walk in dressing area with plenty of cupboards and drawers.

Rooms small, but clean and sufficient - one of the 4 couples in our group got the rooftop suite - with great patio - would recommend spending the extra money for this suite - however, the other \"suites\" they charged extra for were not worth it - would opt to get the rooftop suite or just go with regular room. The rooftop breakfast each morning (we stayed 4 nights) was very nice. Unlike other reviews - we found the front desk help to be very friendly and helpful. There is a restaurant 2 doors down that we ate at twice, called Lagana - reasonable and great food - also bought some jewelry at the place right next door. If the church right beside the hotel is open - Don't miss it - not much on outside but breathtaking on the inside.......we would stay at this hotel again and will recommend it to friends.", "Date": "November 18, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boca Raton, Florida", "Title": "\u201cLoved the Hotel Portoghesi\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4086524", "Content": "We stayed in the one bedroom apartment on the little side street next to the hotel.
