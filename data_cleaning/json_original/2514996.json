First of all, the breakfast is only \"hot\" for about an hour, which is a problem. Another interesting thing about the breakfast is that the entire time we were there (for 3 days) there was no butter or margarine available. Seems like something that should be taken care of, and people had definitely complained. The people working the front desk were rarely at the front desk. In fact, in three days, going out frequently for walks, to go see our daughter, or just going to the pool or to breakfast (I would get up early enough to get a hot breakfast; my wife slept in so she was out of luck) I saw a person actually behind the front desk once. Each time i had a question I had to shout for someone to come to the desk. There was a back room not visible to any guest and the front desk person would eventually emerge from there. There was no way to let someone know (no ringer, bell, etc.) that you needed assistance, so I just got used to shouting. I didn't bring a computer so I was using the business center to check emails and do some work. On the second day of our stay early in the morning both computers crashed. I went and got the front desk person, who of course was in the back room. He made some attempt to solve the problem with the computers, could not make anything happen, and said he would call the \"computer guys\" who would fix them that day. When I checked the next morning, nothing had been fixed, of course, and I am pretty sure no one had been contacted to attempt to correct the problem. On the second day of our stay, I noticed that the pool towels were dwindling to next to nothing, so I went to the front desk and asked if some could be brought in. He assured me this would happen but the next morning when I went for a swim there was only one towel. While I was swimming, a guy came in to empty and clean the hot tub. He appeared to be a maintenance person who does this kind of work for the hotel. Two other ladies and I were hoping to use the hot tub but the process of emptying and cleaning the hot tub made that impossible. I guess doing this before pool hours isn't possible. The guy did go and get some towels for us, since there was only just the one. Finally it was time to check out and start a drive to Chicago to see our other daughter. I went to the front desk. Of course no one was there. I rapped on the counter, then shouted a few times. Nothing. Waited a minute or so. A nice woman who was cleaning the lobby saw I wanted to talk to the front desk person so she called a number, and I heard the phone ringing, for quite awhile. No one answered. At last the front desk guy emerged from the back room, telling me \"Sorry, I had to deal with about six phone calls.\" I knew that was b.s. (at least I'm pretty sure it was) and let him know that, plus some of the other complaints about our stay. He was almost entirely unapologetic and offered nothing. So here's my warning on this hotel. It's a very nice facility, the rooms are fine, the pool is ok, etc. But the management isn't paying attention to the breakfast (it really is simple to keep the type of hot breakfast items the hotel provides--scrambled eggs, sausage, bacon--warm for the full time breakfast is served, 6:30-9:30, but this isn't happening; and for heaven's sakes, someone could get some margarine eventually, one would hope), and there must be something happening in the back room behind the front desk that is very exciting because that's where the people who should answer a guest's questions always are. I'm sure Wingate doesn't want that kind of customer service at its hotels.", "Date": "April 7, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGreat Job\u201d", "Author": "zahnpilot", "ReviewID": "UR126944823", "Content": "Traveling on an extended stay for work so I am trying a number of hotels in the area 1 week at a time and was very impressed with the Wingate.

Second was the internet speed. Ok for first 2 nights but afterwards, not acceptable for wireless. My 3G phone connection was faster (I tested it).

My only negative thing that I would have to say is that the room is slightly cramped. The desk chair always seemed to be in the way (we ended up moving it out from under the desk and up against a wall). The bathroom, while lovely, was also small. I am about 5 foot 8, and when I was changing in the bathroom, my fingers hit the ceiling. I believe the website mentions that there are curved shower rods in the shower. Yes, this is true, but it doesn't seem to add space because the show rods are mounted only 30 inches from the wall - so at the widest point it only seems like a regularly sized shower (hopefully that makes sense).

We appreciated the microwave, refrigerator, and coffee maker in our room. The breakfast area was well stocked and kept clean and tidy during the breakfast service. Easy access to the expressway and local restaurants. I highly recommend to anyone that they should stay here while in the Champaign-Urbana area.", "Date": "November 28, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Great Lakes country", "Title": "\u201cNewer motel, nicely furnished\u201d", "Author": "luvtodrive", "ReviewID": "UR38158887", "Content": "New since about March 2009, clean, quiet, nice furnishings, quick checkin, but I was given a keycard to an already-occupied room.

Rates were reasonable (I chose the non-refundable rate, saving about $10-20). Breakfast bar was nice, with a do-it-yourself waffles machine, scrambled eggs, sausage, mini-pastries, bagels, bread, cereal, juices, fruit (though it looked a little old - the oranges were kind of shriveled).", "Date": "August 19, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Naperville, IL.", "Title": "\u201cBest Place To Stay In Champaign\u201d", "Author": "traverlerjack", "ReviewID": "UR25837563", "Content": "This is one the nicest places I've stayed in, certainly the best in the Champaign-Urbana area. The entrance lobby is beautiful and clean. This hotel is new within the last 6 months. The place is impeccably clean. The rooms are spacious and the beds are very comfortable in fact one of the most comfortable beds I've ever slept on. The room has a flat screened TV which has plenty of cable channels. The bathroom was beautiful with a very comfortable shower. The pool area with the whirlpool next to it are very nice. The pool & whirlpool water temperatures were just right. The complimentary breakfast was fine. The make-your-own waffles were delicious. The eating area was quite spacious and comfortable seating and clean tables. You can watch TV on the lobby's huge flat screened TV while you eat. If you need a place to stay in the the Champaign-Urbana whether business or leisure I guarantee this is the one!

I think we may have been the first to stay in our room. The location is great, about 10 minutes to the University but just 5 minutes to 2 main shopping areas. One large mall with Macys and Berengers and the other area has Staples, WalMart, Target etc. Breakfast is included in price and 2 out of 3 mornings included the make it yourself waffles *yum*. There were also hot eggs and sausage patties each morning. The coffee was excellent. The room (2 queens) was very spacious and had a desk with chair as well as a chair/ottoman combo. The beds were very comfortable and the hotel was very quiet. It is in a bit from the highway so much quieter than some places we have stayed. The front desk and breakfast room staff were always very friendly and greeted us each time we entered and left. My only issues: water pressure wasn't the best however, this may be a regional thing. Cheese omeletes weren't labeled on the breakfest buffet. I don't eat cheese and just thought it was a scrambled type dish.
