Absolutely no complaints, although if you expect breakfast. Its coffee and croissants. The Staff very friendly and are so helpful. I would say its a budget Hotel but the way i see it is that Rome is Amazing and you will only be in your room to sleep and shower.

The room was quite small, especially for 4 people (two adults and 2 teenagers). The room had a musty smell that was quite disturbing. The bathroom was very small with an accordian style 'door'. They claim to have air-conditioning, and they did have a unit over the door but it did not work. They also claim to have Wi-fi in the room, well the only way we could access it was by opening the door to the room and puting the table halfway out into the hallway.

Made the mistake of booking Rome last minute. Always book Rome hotels before you start your vacation, or else you'll have difficulty finding room, and you will pay through the nose. I am not a picky traveler, but this hotel was awful. They showed me a room with the toilet in the shower, and I asked to upgrade to a better room. The room I ended up with had the shower separated from the toilet, thank goodness. But the water took 5 - 10 min. to warm up. The window leading to the courtyard did not lock properly (Room30) so I worried about someone breaking in. The room door had a HUGE keyhole, so anyone from the hallway could scoot up to the door and peek in. I had to hang a piece of paper over the hole.(!) The topsheet of the bed felt dirty when I touched it. The room was so small, I could barely put my small suitcase in their so-called \"closet\". When we walked around the community, we felt very unsafe and nothing was open at night. The maid left my backpack right by the door, with the door wide open! I could only stand to stay for 2 nights before getting a really expensive room at Best Western (it was so worth it). It would have only been 1 night, but we had trouble finding accomodation. Only stay at Hotel Monaco if you normally stay in dirty huts.", "Date": "September 29, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brisbane, Australia", "Title": "\u201cDon't Bother\u201d", "Author": "Djjhill", "ReviewID": "UR20462584", "Content": "I have to agree with most of the reviews on this hotel because they are all correct. First of all i must say i didn't see the room so i wil not comment on the standard of the actual room. What i will say is that after travelling half way around the world with my wife and 2 small children, arriving at this hotel was the biggest mistake we made when we travelled to Italy. Since we had booked and paid 3 months earlier we were confident we would get a room at the hotel even though after reading the reviews we were concerened about the standard of the hotel. We walked into it with reservations but a very open mind considering that it was only a 2 star but was shocked when we arrived and got told there was no room for us. We were asked if we could go on the other side of the city to a sister hotel for the night and then return for the following 4 nights to finish our stay in the city. After a very heated argument with the \"manager/operator\" we told him that we would change hotels only if we stayed there for our whole stay (the hotel was a 3 star hotel) and that they would pay for the taxi ride. He wasn't happy with this but we gave him no choice and told him that this was not good enough and we were not going to travel back and forth. He agreed with all our requests and the other hotel was FANTASITIC. so the one thing i would say is DO NOT BOOK THIS HOTEL!!!!!!!!!!!! instead spend the extra $20 euros or so a night and stay at the Santa Prassede (see our review on this hotel).", "Date": "September 29, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "australia", "Title": "\u201cTHIS PLACE IS THE PITS\u201d", "Author": "sharmac", "ReviewID": "UR4957690", "Content": "DONT EVEN THINK ABOUT THIS PLACE.

The stupid cleaners through out my partners contact lenses and all we were told was \"tough\" they shouldnt have been in the bathroom and to call our travel agent....after trying to sort this out with them directly they switched off our hot water, NOT that there was much hot water to start with.
