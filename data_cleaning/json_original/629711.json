{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Good Budget Choice I booked Kind Villa Bintang through Agoda based on TripAdvisor reviews.Overall it was fabulous for the price. Sure there are bigger and better resorts around but they also have bigger price tags.The staff were great in all areas. Rocky, who assume was the restaurant manager but didn't really find out, was just so enthusiastic. Every couple of nights they put on a theme dinner. We went to the Balinese night and it was great but sadly only 9 guests went. The food was great, the setting lovely and the traditional dancing beautiful. Make sure you do it if you go.Rooms are big and cable choices varied (important for my husband). The only complaints about the rooms is that our had a lot of damp near the airconditioner which made the room smell a little musty and the towels were very worn. Otherwise all good.Has tea/coffee making facilities in the room which we like and a little fridge.Pool was a great size with a swim up bar. When we were there they were having trouble getting spirits in but were doing the best with what they had.Breakfast was wonderful and very varied.Location is good with lots of restaurants choices around and a little supermarket about 20m up the road.", "Date": "Dec 15, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR256618445", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "GillyGoldCoast"}, {"Content": "A scenic resort       View from our Room's Balcony", "Date": "Nov 6, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR161239283", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Puneet_Bhatia"}, {"Content": "Good value for money We stayed in this hotel for 3 nights in the end of September 2008. This hotel is a small and resonably priced resort, and give you very good value for your money!As this is a small resort, the outdoor area is not very big and the number of beach chairs etc. is limited, but it is very cosy. The staff will recognise you and the service is excellent. The hotel was refurbished in 2005 and the rooms are very nice and clean.Positive:1. New  clean rooms and bathrooms2. Good aircon3. Good service4. Small and cosy5. Nice pool6. Good price (we paid USD 80 incl. breakfast per night, and this was not the cheapest room)Negative:1. No gym2. Not within the Nusa Dua resort area3. Breakfast buffet was limited due to size of the resort, but they still had decent bread, salad, fruit and some local warm dishes.

I had choosed the kinds villa from reviews of other guest. However i must say that I was dissapointed with the rooms. The rooms were a liitle old and not well maintained. I asked to be upgraded but was informed that it is not possible. Any how, i would say that there are better resorts in bali for the same price and i was a little dissapointed all in all. The breakfast was average with not much variety and the same menu was served everyday.

Partially because of the great reviews at tripadvisor, partially because we didn't want to expect too much after an unhappy experience with our previous stay at Seminyak.Overall I would say that this hotel exceeded our expectations, it was one of the cheapest bookable online property we could find in Nusa Dua, yet it provided great service and clean rooms. Probably with another $10-$20 usd you could get a higher star-rated resort, but because Kinds Villa is small compared to the other hotels along the same stretch, we observed that it seems to be quieter. Though the hotel was near full capacity, there were plenty of sun decks and beach chairs available; we took a walk down the beach at nusa dua and other hotels' beaches were quite packed \u9225?so it all boils down to what you want out of your stay,Wifi is available but you have to buy a prepaid card - 5 hours for 79,000 rupiah. Don't expect much out of the breakfast as well, but I think for the overall value there's nothing much more we could ask for.Staff was generally friendly.There's parasailing, jet ski and other stuff available right at their beach so it is really convenient if you're into water sports.I tried their spa massage, $15 for an hour's worth, slightly pricier than what you get outside the hotel, but the quality was worth the price. If you're feeling adventurous, you can have a massage at the beach itself provided by the locals.", "Date": "Jul 17, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR171674479", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "wynlim"}, {"Content": "Loved Kind Villa Bintang       When the tide goes out in the afternoons", "Date": "Apr 24, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR817398786", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "tarynsmum"}, {"Content": "Great location, fantastic staff!

We would have had to walk out of our room and towards the courtyard area in the middle to see the ocean. The pool is very nice, but the beach is not. The breakfast that comes with the room is mediocre.The selection of restaurants in the area is pretty limited as well. The hotel restaurant a limited dinner menu. The best place to eat is the coco bistro which is a short walk from the hotel.Overall it was a nice stay, but i don't think I would stay here again, or anywhere in Nusa Dua for that matter.

I enjoyed the fact it only had 54 rooms so it was not as impersonal as the larger hotels. All the staff were great, very friendly, helpful  informative. The ambience in the dining area by the pool of a morning was very relaxing because of the sounds of the Balinese music. The buffet breakfast was delicious with a choice of Balinese foods as well as more traditional breakfast foods.The hotel grounds were beautifully kept, it was great to sit in the patio area off my room and enjoy the lush foliage. The pool was just the right temperature  there were plenty of loungers around it.Just down the beach to the left by the small temple I had great massages from a group of women who worked on me three at a time. Bliss. As a woman travelling on my own I felt safe in the area even at night. The locals are very friendly.

Kind Villa Bintang Resort  Spa live up to its name. =) Hotel personnel are Kind (especially Romeo in the Pool Bar area), and it is stellar (Bintang means Star) in all other aspects.

It's fronting the beach and just next to it is a stall offerring all kinds of water adventures. It also has small huts fronting the beach and a nice relaxing pool. Spa services are quite cheap for hotel standard (US$15/hour). Food is not wow, but is just nice. What i loved the most is they have books all over the place for guests to borrow...and it's not just any books but some fairly recent ones.
