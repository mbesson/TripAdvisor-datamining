I'm not a picky customer, but the hotel was not of 3 * standard at all; you may be better off in a hostel around the same area for a better price. The room was adequate, but rather small. The bathroom wasn't too pleasant - toilet seat had broken off and was just placed on top. The water was lukewarm and seemed to be yellowish. There was also no soap in the bathroom. When I asked for some at the foyer, I was told there was no soap and given a few sachets of shower gel. The staff are a bit of a mixed bunch. If you have the misfortune to be met by the older lady with spectacles be prepared to be totally ignored. The two younger girls on the desk in the evening are great - polite, friendly and very helpful. If you wanted a hot drink you could ask at reception and if you're lucky they will open up the restaurant to give you access to the coffee machine - they will charge 1 euro for a cup of tea/cofffee. Beware of the lift!! This is an extremely scary contraption. You can squeeze 2 of you in (very intimitely) and then stand back while trying to press the button. The doors didn't shut properly, and if you happen to stand near the edge you could probably get bits of yourself sliced off. It did remind me a little of staying in a real life 'Fawlty Towers' - the experience was not necessarily negative, but you really would expect better. If it weren't for the staff and lack of amenities this hotel could be very nice. The only real advantage of this hotel is its location. There are a number of hostels around the area, which I think I will look into if I go back to Madrid again. Whilst it was relatively cheap, I am sure you could still get more for your money in a nice hostel. This was a bit of a let-down.", "Date": "December 11, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chandler's Ford England", "Title": "\u201cBudget Hotel\u201d", "Author": "wlmasters", "ReviewID": "UR6307638", "Content": "Having read previous reviews I was a bit sceptical about staying here.

Yes the hotel can be a bit noisy at night, yes the rooms are not to the high standard you'd expect in a 5* hotel. But this isn't a 5* hotel! I think this is what some of the previous reviews seem to forget! For the price I paid, I got exactly what I wanted - a fantastically located lodgings right in the heart of the capital.

They say they offer free beverages throughout the day and breakfast - this is not the case - they want payment for both. The airport shuttle bus does not run between 1pm and 4pm - we arrived at 1.45pm, so had to wait for hours at the airport.
