We had a room on the top floor and heard no noise from outside, even thought there is a busy road and a railway line adjacent. There is a Wetherspoons opposite, so you could go there for breakfast as it is cheaper and better than the hotels. There is a Tesco's around the corner, but it is shut on a Sunday. Only one quibble, and that is with the towels, even though there was two of us in the room, they kept changing the towels and only leaving one bath towel.

If you can't get into the hotels at EXCEL or they're too expensive, this Travelodge is only a 15-minute ride away on the DLR railway with bed and breakfast for two people on a Saturday night costing less than \u00a3120. Tower Bridge is over the road and it is less than a two-minute walk from the nearest Tube station. What we liked: The staff were very friendly, even offering to turn the TV over to my favourite programme when I was the only person in that part of the restaurant, overall cleanliness was excellent, a hairdrier and iron were available to borrow from Reception, kettle with tea and coffee-making facilities in the room, great choice of pub-grub style evening meals served freshly and very quickly at reasonable prices, great choice of food at breakfast, lovely comfortable bed, reasonably sized room, plenty of storage space for an overnight stay, nice shower in the bathroom, room-card controlled security on the bedroom corridoor entrances, nice warm shower, atmospheric lighting in the bedroom and well-stocked vending machines in Reception to satisfy the midnight munchies. What we didn't like: The cracked mirror in the bedroom and the cracked basin in the bathroom. There were only two, thin pillows provided and only one bathtowel and one small towel. The observation is about the room being booked for two but prepared for one person. Only instant coffee is available at breakfast. Top tips: Manage your expectations with a 'no frills' hotel chain - don't forget to pack the toothpaste and all toiletries. They only provide a very small hand soap in the bathroom but this is clearly mentioned on the Travelodge website. Above all, take ear plugs to drown out other people's movements in the corridoors and lots of noise from the street outside, particularly if you like to sleep in late with the windows open. Overall, if you can do that it is a great, cheap and cheerful hotel.

It is basic accommodation, but everything you need is there, including a very comfortable, large bed. It was very clean and warm, too. Breakfast was included, though I don't think it is always. Again, it was very good, being a buffet-style, where you could eat as much or as little as necessary. Service was polite, cheerful and very efficient.

The back side of the hotel is next to a railway station, so braking trains screeching sounds until 23:00 every night and from early morning. So I asked to move my room to a street facing room - here it was even worse because the noise from the cars get reflected between the buildings, and their noise keeps going long after 23:00, so the train side was actually better. The room was also very scarce, but had the basics you would expect.

I have stayed in various Travelodges previously and, generally speaking, you get what you pay for - no-frills, budget accommodation. I frequently stay in the Travelodge at Southwark and couldn't really complain about it. However this was my first (and hopefully only) ever stay at the Travelodge at London Bridge. I checked in quite late on a Tuesday evening after a vey long and tiring day. At reception they wouldn't give me a breakfast voucher, even though I had an email printout from a booking agency showing that B&B had been booked. The guy on reception was very polite and apologetic, but insisted that I would have to speak with his manager in the morning to get it sorted ( which I did and it was indeed sorted very quickly). I was allocated a room on the 5th floor. I don't know if every floor is the same but there are seriously creaky floorboards both along the length of the corridor and inside my room! Inside the room - electric wall heater which was off, two windows both open - so it was freezing. Closed windows, turned on heater. Tried turning on TV and found that the remote didn't work. It had batteries and a red light indicating power, but it didn't control the TV. Another problem was that there were only a few sheets of toilet roll left on the roll, and no spare roll in the room. I didn't notice this until the next day when (ahem) it really mattered! What really bothered me the most though were the multiple stains on the carpet adjacent to the bed. Without forensic testing I obviously can't be sure, but I'm pretty certain that these were dried bodily fluids. As I really did not want to walk on these in my bare feet I actually moved the bed to cover them - out of sight, out of mind, only they weren't really out of mind.... Normally there would have been enough in the way of problems there for me to have complained at the time and requested a change of room but like I said I was shattered and just wanted to sleep. Unfortunately the hotel is located is very noisy at night, with car horns, police sirens etc going at frequent intervals. Apart from the vile orange juice substitute (common to all Travelodges), breakfast was okay and the breakfast/restaurant area is bright and spacious.

The room was clean and there was no mould in the bathroom. The mattress was a little bit on the soft side but didn't have any large hollows in (like previous ones). We only had one towel so we asked for another which was fine, but the cleaners obviously don't understand the concept on the tag in the bathroom which says leave your towels on the floor and we will change them, leave them on the rail and we won't. They took both our towels even though they were on the rail, and only replaced them with one, so we had to keep asking for another towel each day. Not very environmentally friendly. There wasn't a hairdryer in the room but you can go and ask and they lend you one. Due to our previous bad experiences of Travelodges, we did not book breakfast, there is however a Wetherspoons at the back which does breakfast very reasonably. The hotel was very easy to find - tube to Tower Bridge, left and round the corner as you leave the station, you see a Minories bar over the road and the Travelodge is behind it. When you get off the tube you will see Tower of London directly in front. The location was ideal to visit most places although be careful at weekends as this is when they close some tube stations for maintenance. We walked to the London Eye, going via the Monument and St Pauls, it was quite a way but it was a nice day. We walked back along the Thames and there were some lovely rivers edge bars to stop at and we crossed back over Tower bridge. Because the Tower is so close, visit it in the morning and make sure you do the jewels bit early as by the time we came out there were huge queues and it wasn't even a busy time of year!

All I wanted was a room that was clean and functional. Sadly, this Travelodge failed to deliver on both counts. My small room on the 4th floor looked tired, every wall was grubby, and a tennis ball-sized hole in the plasterwork had been crudely filled. There was an unpleasant stain on the carpet by the side of the bed. I didn\u2019t get close enough to examine what had caused it! The grubby windows opened by about one inch and overlooked offices and several lanes of very noisy traffic (apparently this is the best side of the Travelodge, as the rear backs directly onto a rail line). The bed was incredibly saggy and unsupportive and there were a worrying amount of stains, and what looked like cigarette burn marks on the duvet (strange, as Travelodge has been non-smoking for some time \u2013 so how old is the linen?). The pillows were wafer-thin, but worse was the constant scuttling in the cavity wall during the night. The noise could do with being investigated by Rentokil. After an awful night\u2019s sleep I looked forward to a shower in the relatively modern but small bathroom. Sadly, this was a disappointment, too. The shower only had one setting: so hot it almost burned your skin off. No amount of turning the thermostat down altered the temperature. I didn\u2019t appreciate seeing long hair from a previous guest stuck to the tiles, and mould growing around the base of the shower tray. Could breakfast be this hotel\u2019s saving grace? I\u2019m afraid not. You have to queue and are presented with a knife, fork and plate. The buffet offered a miserable selection of sausages, scrambled eggs and cooked tomatoes \u2013 it looked like it had all been microwaved several hours ago. So I decided to give it a miss and settled for a stale croissant and a self-service slice of toast. Only in central London could Travelodge get away with charging \u00a399.95 (plus an extra \u00a37.95 for breakfast) for such a poorly maintained, scruffy and depressing hotel.

Most of the day the temperature has struggled to get near 10oC and by the time I arrive in the early evening, having arrived in London by train, there is a definite chill in the air.

The room is colder than my refrigerator; I half expect David Attenborough and the Frozen Plant team to pop up filming some penguins and polar bears.

Then there is the quilt; it is thinner than my suit jacket! Fortunately it\u2019s a double and there is only me so I can double it up like a sleeping bag; not a cosy night sleep at all.

Small room with a small en- suite, not much space to store baggage etc. The hotel does not appear to have a luggage room and will not accept baggage prior to/ after check in/ check out. So you have to plan your stay around this. It is in a rather noisy location, with the light rail on one side and a noisy arterial road on the other, which was busy all night. If you are a tourist, the hotel location is ideal for seeing the Tower etc,however be warned that at the weekend this part of the city is essentially \"dead\" with cafes closed, also shops as well, which was rather surprising. A better location is the Covent Garden travel lodge, which again is a basic utilitarian hotel but with a great location. The front of house staff in the Tower Hill location are friendly and helpful, apart from a rather diembodied voice which kept calling out to the reception staff when we tried to verify our booking on arrival at the hotel, \"charge them ten pounds\" this was at ten minutes to the regular check in time. I declined and waited the ten minutes and then booked in. Not a great service example to the front of house staff from ? a manager on duty. Also of note is that the electrical socket in the room was hanging out of the wall and the reading lights attached to the headboard were somewhat loose.

Having prepaid, I was able to use the auto-checkin which dispensed our key. The rooms on the 3rd floor required keycard access which enhanced security in a building which otherwise is open access.

How they would dare to advertise a Continental breakfast when there were only muffins & yoghurt today, or as a hot English with soggy bacon, sausage, \"fake\" scrambled eggs and beans in a dish with a ladle so hot it burnt your hands. Oh, and today there were cold, raw tomatoes. The toaster was one of those grills which takes the bread through a contraption under a heated element, the bread emerging with a very pale tan. Those who were brave enought to put the bread through again caused burning and a plume of smoke which enveloped the dining room.

I booked the room last year not long after booking the concert tickets, and got a rate of about \u00a380 per night for the room. I'd hoped to get one of the special rates and kept checking, but a better rate never came up. I tried to book a twin, but the website offered me a \"Family Room\", describing it as having a double bed, a sofa, and a \"put up\" bed. We reckoned that would be OK for the two of us. Right from check in, things started to go wrong. I thought check in time was 2pm, so after arriving in the area at about 1pm we had lunch in the Wetherspoons nearby, and arrived at the hotel at 2pm. We were told that we couldn't check in until 2.30pm and it would be an extra \u00a310 to check in early. Fair enough, rules are rules, but she could have been a bit nicer. This time we found the wonderful Minories pub next door to kill another half hour. On returning to the hotel, the first room we were given was just bizarre. A double bed in one corner, masses of other space in the room - but no other furniture apart from a small desk. No sofa, no put up bed, nothing. You could have had a roller disco on the empty carpet. So we returned to reception and asked for a family room. The room we were given this time was small with a double bed and a sofa that had a pull out mattress underneath which wasn't made up. But quite frankly, I don't see how you could make it up. There was just no carpet space to put it up. Thankfully my friend and I have known each other long enough and well enough that we didn't mind just sharing the double, but that could have been a major problem for some people. Again, there was practically no other furniture. One small desk, no drawers. No bedside cabinets. No wardrobe, just a rail with about six hangers. There were only two power points, which for two ladies with phones, hair styling things (and the kettle in the room) was a bit of an issue, especially as the sockets were hanging off the wall and moved whenever you unplugged something. As other reviewers have said, the room could be a bit hot and had no AC. Fair enough, it's a Travelodge. But there is no excuse for the following: - no toilet paper left one day. We were running dangerously low! - half the towels being taken away one day. - the sofa had several quite disturbing stains on it. We didn't eat in the hotel, and I couldn't see why anyone would. The Minories next door does a wide breakfast menu up until noon. Two poached eggs on two slices of toast washed down with a huge fresh orange and soda for under a fiver. Perfect. The one thing it has got going for it is that the location of the hotel is great. Right next to the Tower of London, the Thames, and Tower Bridge. Transport is easy with both Tower Hill tube and Tower Gateway DLR on the doorstep. If, like us and many of the guests in the hotel, you are using it for visiting the O2, I can highly recommend the riverboat service. We pre-booked the O2 express from London Bridge Pier, which was about a 15 minute walk from the hotel. The return clipper stopped at Tower Pier on the return, and we found a pub called the Peacock round the corner which was open until 1am.

T'was ideal for us as we weren't keen on spending time in the room lounging around. C'mon folks - A holiday is meant for traveling, not for staying in your hotel. To make it snappy, let's break it down: Location: Great stuff. T'was not in central London but at least it was next to Tower of London and a Tube station. Rooms: No frills. No cupboards or toiletries though there's a single bar of soap they won't bother changing whether you stay a day or 7 days. No Wi-Fi though you can pay 20 quid for a week for that. You could opt for that or go to any EAT or the nearby Minories pub for free WiFi. No mini fridge either. However, there's a TV, desk and a place to hang your clothes. Service: They actually forgot to clear our room one of the days that we stayed! Yup, we got back to a mess and had to ask for new towels from the reception. They duly obliged without an apology. Oh yes, one of the biggest turnoffs is the lack of a holding space for luggage, but that's a Travelodge policy so not much you can do about that, can you?

It cost about 68 pounds for the one night but hotels in more central areas were double the price so this was a cheap deal, the tube is about 6.40, they stop running around 12.30am but there are the night buses.

The main problem was, although i was on the railway side the train noise wasn't annoying over the weekend, what was worse was the noise coming through the door as people walked past talking, the door didn't hold back much noise at all. In the end you just give up and start trying to hear what the different languages are!! Not really a problem for me but the Minories pub next door did have a late night on friday night, you couldn't hear the musicbut the bass came through the walls, this is only as i was right up that end of the hotel though. It was clean, the shower was good, although i prefer the bottom of the shower curtain to be not floating up and sticking to me! Staff sorted everything quickly. My stay was 4th-7th Feb' and even with the heater turned off the room was plenty warm for me. (it was working just turned off) As mentioned the Wetherspoons is good and close, they serve food till 10pm. We ate there instead of Travelodge for breakfast and food was quick and good, breakfast menu served till 12 noon. We only went to the Liberty Bounds pub which is really nice inside and has a view over to the Tower and Tower Bridge. But across the road there's a set of shops under ground level behind 'EAT' and in there's a KFC and also a pizza place where you can get an 11\" pizza for \u00a35 (3 toppings), it's freshly made and cheap and was fine. Also the hotel is a short walk from Liverpool Street Station, and a small tip if you're going to stock up on water rather then paying crazy prices for small bottles in small shops or at the Travelodge, where it'll cost you nearly that much for not even a litre, is to go to Tesco, there is one outside L.Street main exit onto Bishopsgate, or, there is another one near to Monument, where you can get 4 litres for \u00a31.50 (2 x 2l bottles) So, overall a good stay, it was the weekend so was always going to be quieter than a weekday stay, such as trains didn't sound horns during weekend but they did monday morning.

The location is therefore fantastic - just round the corner from the Tower of London and Tower Bridge, thus I rated this \"excellent\" for location. The Tube is cheap and cheerful and, even if you get lost, it's easy to get off at the next station to backtrack or simply ask any of the helpful staff in the Underground. The staff at the hotel are friendly and helpful and always have a ready smile so I was happy to rate them \"very good\". Cleanliness in the hotel generally I also rated \"very good\" - same in the room - though my bin in the bathroom wasn't emptied on my second day. The bedding was changed daily and ample fresh towels replenished, also on a daily basis. The room is basic but adequate for a short stay. As with all Travelodges, there are tea and coffee making facilities though it has to be said they are a bit stingy with the teabags (only one provided in a room catering for two people). To be fair, though, I may have been given more had I requested this. The reasons I gave the room an overall \"poor\" rating was for the following reasons: 1) lack of drawers! There were none at all in my room even though there was plenty space for them. I therefore had to put my smalls, t shirts etc onto a shelf above the coathangers, which is intended for towels and the spare pillow. The towels therefore had to be moved into the bathroom and the pillow I put on my bed. I'm only 5ft 3\" so it was a bit of a pain to reach up to rifle through the things I needed on the shelf. 2) shortage of coathangers - only 6 provided. This was just enough for me on my own but no good at all for a couple. 3) My chair seat wasn't bolted down to the legs on the left hand side so any movement to the right meant you were likely to fall off - quite dangerous for people who are maybe not as quick to save themselves as I was! 4) Lack of power sockets. There was only two in my room - located at the desk under the window. Not very handy when you need to put on your laptop and charge a phone, camera and mp3 player - all while heating up the kettle to make a cup of tea while trying to dry your hair with a hairdryer - so things had to be disconnected constantly at the risk of forgetting to plug them in again to recharge. 4) I was on the ground floor (room 12) which faces a main road. Unless you pull down the window blind (no curtain) everyone can see into your room. I was never awoken by traffic noise however. The bed was a double - lovely soft clean duvet with a comforable mattress giving me a good night's sleep every night meaning it earned an \"excellent\" rating. I chose not to book breakfast at this hotel having had many Travelodge breakfasts over the years in various hotels around the country. I feel they are not worth the money charged and, passing through the breakfast area one morning, spotted that they are still serving the same tired old dried out breakfasts they normally serve, so was glad I didn't have any. Instead I tried the pub literally steps away from the hotel at the front door. The Minories is a very spacious pub but manages to retain a cosy feel due its fairly low arched/brick ceiling and is located right underneath the railway line so the trains travelling overhead can be a bit noisy. The food and service however is fantastic (breakfast for \u00a35.99 including a drink). I booked my room a good few weeks in advance of travel through one of Travelodge's own promotional emails. Had I not got the room for \u00a335 a night via this special offer, I would have paid around \u00a385 a night for the room.

King size, but it was as if King Kong had been lying in the middle of it and left a rather large hole in the mattress.

The towels were clean but well used (quite rough) but this is a Travelodge so don't expect luxury thread counts. Flat screen TV was great for watching the news while partner was in the shower. The room does get very hot (even in November), this was quickly rectified by opening a window during the day and closing it at night. We were in a front room, overlooking offices and a busy road, the double internal and external glazing made sure that noise was not an issue.

I had misunderstood the search menu and, wanting twin beds, ended up in a handicapped room. I hope we didn't displace any handicapped people but the room did have twin beds. Conveniently located a five minute walk from the Tower Hill Underground Station, we found it simple to get about town. The room was large to accomodate wheelchairs. With few amenities, the room did have a kettle for heating water, air conditioning, and quiet location (on the side of the building away from the train noises.) We chose not to buy the offered breakfast but ate either at the Minories Pub next door, at the Weatherspoons across the street, or from the grocery store located nearby in St. Katherine's Dock. All of those options were less expensive than the offered breakfast at the hotel, which looked just ok. One thing I would mention is that we found few restaurants in the area open in the evening. Most of them served lunches to busineses and closed late afternoon. So if you don't want to eat at the pub next door, you might want to plan to eat away from the hotel at dinner time. One other thing future guests may want to know is that the Travelodge really has nothing to do with the internet you pay for when you register. It is offered by an offsite company and the staff at the Travelodge is largely uninformed as to its use. The way it works is not intuitive, at least it wasn't to me. When you make your reservation and pay for internet, you sign up for a My Travelodge account. A voucher code is sent to that account and you use the voucher code every time you sign onto the internet. The only other two complaints we had were that the toilet paper wasn't refilled even when the roll was completely empty until we requested more paper and that there was only enough hot water to take a tepid shower. These weren't major things and were offset by the price of the room (Our room averaged 60 BPS a day) and the convenient location.

This was very last minute and I did not have much time to look around, but the little time I did spend looking at hotels I was never too sure about location, value for money, cleanliness... We ended up booking the Travelodge, because I thought it was a name I could trust. I never stayed in one, so didnt know what to expect. First of all 250\u00a3 is not really what I call \"budget\". But I thought at least I would get everything I needed out of it. When we arrived i did look rather new and modern and a friendly lady checked us in immediately even though we were a little early. She proceeded with giving us one room key. I asked for a second, which she gave to us at no extra charge. Trying to get into our room, we were greeted by two confused spanish ladies, who clearly already occupied the room. So down we went and explained the situation and after asking us about 20 times \"Are you sure?\" she gives us a second room. This one was not occupied. It was good enough sized, hardly any furniture. There was nowhere to store our cloths so we had to leave them in our cases for the whole stay. The telly was a flatscreen mounted to the wall but was adjusted, so that it was hard to see a picture when lying on the bed. Our room was facing the station behind the hotel and as we were on the first floor, there was just a brick wall for a view. The windows only opened about 2inc for safety reasons, which was rather inconvenient as there was no fan in the bathroom and this 2inc gap was the only place where the steam could come out from after we took showers. The bathroom was very small. There was no bath, just a shower, no shampoo or anything like that was provided, but I was informed about that when I made the booking, so i remembered to bring some. We didnt eat in the restaurant area and while we were there we didnt see anyone eat there either. The prices were rather discusting at 7\u00a3 for breakfast each. We went to a pub on the other side of the bridge every morning which did full english breakfast for 1.99\u00a3. That is what I call great value! There was also a 5\u00a3 charge to use the internet in the hotel so we took our laptop with us to where we had breakfast as they had (like nearly every place these day) free WIFI. The good points about the hotel are deffinately cleanliness, location and comfort. It was very clean, with no signes of anyone occupying the room before us. The location was awesome! Right by the Tower bridge and the tower of London. The tube station was right around the corner and there was a tesco express there aswell. And the beds are soooo cumfy! The shower was brilliant! And we hardly heard any noise from the train station. I realy wished I had done more research before booking it, as I am sure I could have gotten just as much comfort for less. They didnt even have a hairdryer, telephone or a clock in the room! All things that I totally expected to be there.

Ah..... no phone. I went down to the reception to ask about this, the guy gave me a slip of paper with the hotels number written on it and said 'just use your mobile, mate!'. Fantastic... I should have thought of that... isnt modern technology great!!! He then provided me with an extra bath towel. One problem down. I went back to the hotel room a little flustered. During the next 5 minutes come kid from outside actually entered the room. I have no idea how.

We looked at other Travelodges/Premier Inn etc and they were \u00a3400+ for anywhere near central London. We arrived and the hotel was clean and the staff very helpful. The hotel is situated 2 mins walk from Tower Hill tube station, which is great for sightseeing London as it's on both the Circular and District lines, which allow easy access across the whole of London. It was easy to get to places and get back on an evening, I'd recommend the London Travelcard - it's great value for getting around London. The room was basic, but very clean. Towels were provided, although only one for a double room - we read reviews beforehand, so take your own. Although the hotel is next to the DLR it is well soundproofed. Saying that, it was hot when we stayed and we left the windows open all night and didn't get disturbed. The only real grumble I have with the hotel is that the food is a real rip off there. Although we didn't eat there, it was \u00a37.50 for breakfast each per day (which we didn't have). There is a pub literally 20 metres away called 'The Minores' which is AMAZING! They do breakfast for \u00a34.95 in there, should you want that, however, we just ate muffins we got from Tesco's. However I cannot reccomend enough going to The Minores for dinner, TWO MEALS FOR \u00a37.95! BARGAIN! The meals we had in there were LOVELY, loads to choose from (We'd recommend the beef wrapped in a Yorkshire pudding) chilli, lasagna, veggie kiev, chicken/beef burgers etc etc. We were recommended the 'Wetherspoons' in Tower Hill from one of these reviews, but it was rubbish! Go to The Minores! Even things like the chicken burgers at The Minores are made with real chicken breasts opposed to Wetherspoons 'pre-packed-frozen-stick in the oven for 10 mins' burgers. Great value at The Minores! Also compared to the food that the Travelodge serve, you can't go wrong as you can get two meals at The Minores for the same price as one at the hotel!

Our room was 230, and it looked out to the DLR, however we never heard the trains going past and they certainly did not disturb our sleep - and we had the window wide open.

The bathroom was great! it was a shower only room which was nice. Me and my husband are both 6ft tall, and for once the fixed shower on the wall did not come to our chests, we could actually stand under it and have a proper shower, unlike most hotels where we have to crouch under it to wash our hair and stuff. The bathroom was very clean, We got back to our hotel late in the evening - past 1130pm on both nights and by the time we got back the bar was closed and there was no where to get food from except the vending machines for snacks. We asked at reception if anywhere was open in the area for food but they said no. However they gave us the phone number of a pizza place and we called them and they delivered right to the hotel, lovely pizza - very cheap too. One afternoon we ate in the Wetherspoons, I have been in many before however they food in this one was nasty, we did not go back.

We arrived earlier than 3pm for check in, please be aware that the receptionist will charge you \u00a310.00 if you get there before 3pm! Was not aware of this, but we paid it as we didnt fancy lugging our suitcases around London Bridge and Tower Bridge. Also, make sure that if there is more than one of you in the room, that the receptionist provides you with a second bath towel. The double rooms are only kitted out for single travellers (? I suppose this is because they are more used to single business travellers staying?). My husband overheard a very irate guest who was very upset that there was only one towel in the room. So be aware of this. The hotel is nice and airy when you arrive, the rooms, as stated in previous reviews, are very basic but very clean and new. There is next to nowhere to keep your clothes so we lived out of our suitcases, and only hung up our smart evening wear. We had no problem with this to be honest as we had read previous reviews warning us of the lack of storage. Our room was on the second floor and was right next to the trains passing by (DLR) but with the windows shut you could hardly hear them. The bed was very comfortable. The TV had been angled on the wall so I think they have now addressed the previous problems with the angle of the TV and how it is viewed from the bed. The angle is fine, the picture is clear. Take a hairdryer with you (there isn't one in the room) and your toiletries. If you forget any, the vending machine downstairs had toothbrushes, toothpaste and shower gel etc. The towels are crisp and fluffy. The pub next door (the Minories) is great for a wind down drink and unusually situated in the arch beneath the railway so every now and again you get the trains rumbling overhead! We had a cheap and tasty dinner here (two meals for \u00a37.95) so they are obviously trying to compete with the Witherspoons up the road. It was a nice and comfortable pub, lovely and quiet in the afternoons. We took breakfast at Witherspoons (called Goodmans Field) and you can get a full English breakfast for \u00a32.99! Very good value also is the tea, toast, butter and jams for \u00a31.39, although we seemed to be charged slightly differently each time we ordered it.

If you\u2019re considering booking, especially as the weather gets warmer, please be aware that most of the rooms DO NOT have air conditioning!

We were in a room on the first floor overlooking the road, but I could not hear any noise from outside in the mornings. The rooms are basic (it is a Travelodge afterall!), but sufficient - reasonable size, good beds, good shower. We opted for breakfast, just to see what it would be like, and it was ok - cereals/fruit/fried breakfast/tea/coffee/juice. The fact it is buffet means you can get up as many times as you want to get more, so you can get your money's worth! The first morning it was busy and did get a bit crowded around the cooked items! , probably partly due to the marathon the day before and people obviously staying over from that, however Tuesday morning was pretty quiet. It is also in a great location, very close to Tower Hill tube, as well as Tower of London/Tower Bridge. Couple of pubs nearby which are also worth visiting for food/drinks.

The location is great for the City, but even when I was visiting for pleasure I didn't find the hotel (if you can call it that?) to be too far out of the way, and Tower Hill and Aldgate tube stations are only 2 minutes round the corner. The reception staff are very pleasant and nothing is too much trouble. The rooms are perfectly adequate but can get quite hot. This wasn't really a problem in March but it was really warm in London on Wednesday and I had to open the window, which resulted in quite a lot of traffic noise due to the room facing Goodmans Yard. Echoing previous reviews, the angle of the plasma tvs needs amending. Even sat up in bed I couldn't see the picture properly (but I'm not the tallest of people!). I should have mentioned this to reception but was in a rush checking out. Didn't opt for the \u00a37.50 all you can eat breakfast, choosing instead to visit the Weatherspoons across the road for a \u00a33.49 full English and coffee.

However I believe both lines that serve this station are closed on Sundays so it is important to be familiar with the buses from this location if you are staying on Sunday. The RV1 and 15 buses are very handy and close by for site seeing. This hotel is also very close to the Tower of London.
