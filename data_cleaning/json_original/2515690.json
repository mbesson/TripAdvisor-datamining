The in-room safe was big enough for a 13\" computer. The condition of the room was sparkless clean for the whole of my stay. One strange thing though is that each floor holds rooms for both smoking and not smoking. And the rooms are not sealed so you can actually smell the smoke in the hallway. I did not stay next to a smoking room and I did not smell any smoke in my room. Also on my floor there seemed to be a very loud AC or similar which I actually could here from my room 3 rooms away from the noise. There is also wi-fi which actually worked quite good during my stay. Breakfast was included and it was basically ok. The restaurant is located just beside the hotel and serves a selection of bread, jam, variety of scrambled egg, occasionally pancakes, cereals and some pastry. Overall it was ok. But once again the staff did not seemed to care much about the guests. Location is ok but walking back to the hotel at night seemed a little intimidating. There is three big parking lots surrounding the hotel and when night falls it attracts many unfortunate homeless people who decides to sleep there overnight. So the walk back to the hotel at night is not scary but for me it was troublesome. For my next stay in San Diego I will probably try another hotel as there is many hotels in the area for the same price.", "Date": "October 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "BC", "Title": "\u201cGood value, great service\u201d", "Author": "Duncow", "ReviewID": "UR118866816", "Content": "The location is great, there is free pick up from the cruise ship terminal.

Coming from a house that lives off of a small water heater, it was soooooo nice to take a 20 minute HOT shower! We had a great view of the city, every few minutes an airplane would fly right by. No noise at all. The only noise that I heard was the trolly, but it stopped when we went to sleep. The only thing that could have been a problem was the elevator. They are updating their elevators, so only one is in use. We left and came back to the hotel when there wasn't many people there so we didn't have many issues. But I would assume that during check-in and check-out hours it'll be a little difficult to get to a higher room floor. So if you are going there soon, call and see if there elevator is still under matinee. If so ask if you can get a first floor room. It'll be great when both can be used!

If you do pay for parking make sure your little tag is visible, ours fell down and we got a ticket. They did have a complimentary breakfast. It was just okay.

Besides visiting the conference, we wanted to do some sightseeing and shopping. For this purpose, the hotel was just perfect. It is located just a few steps from the bay promenade, along which one could walk either to the convention center wihtin 20mins or so, and also into the city (the shorter way to the city and shopping areas such as Horton Plaza is straight through the city and does not even take 10mins). Check-Inn upon arrival was fast and friendly. Not over-friendly as some might know from 4- or 5-star hotels...but on the other hand, I did not want to become friends with the receptionists ;-) and they were nice enough to make us feel fine. The room (and we \"only\" had a standard room) was spacious with two huge queen beds and a lovely view to the Star of India sailship. Very clean, nice bathtub with shower included, which had a good water pressure. We also appreciated the coffee machine in the room, which helped especially during the first two days when we were still in a jet-lag. ;-) The wireless internet was sometimes a bit slow and my colleague was kicked out the net a few times, but on the other hand, it is free (try to get free internet throughout european hotels...good luck!) and overall worked good enough to check e-mails and do things such as skype. Some people mentioned the trains blowing their horns all night...well, yes, you can hear them once in a while, but we thought that the sound-proof windows did a good job and both had a decent sleep all week. What might be more of a problem if you have a light sleep or get disturbed easily is a room on one of the lower floors facing the pool. Another colleague was on the 3rd floor and said he could hear the pool generator (or whatever it was) quite clearly. To have breakfast, you have to walk out the hotel a few metres to the left and step into the adjoining restaurant. Not a big problem in sunny and warm April. Breakfast itself was ok...as always in the USA, way too sweet. ;-) But with choices of bread and scrumbled eggs, butter, jelly and several kinds of cereals, two or three kinds of juice, coffee (even decaf) and some (for our taste rather disgusting) kinds of oatmeal or porridge. Oh and of course pancakes and maple syrup. So overall and since it was included in the price, that was fine and enough to have a good start into the day. The hotel, by the way, is also just a block or so from Little Italy where you can find a lot of options to have a nice evening in a good and affordable restaurant. All in all, the rate we got was excellent (149,-$ plus tax), the hotel nicely situated, clean, spacious and friendly, and I would not hesitate staying there again!", "Date": "May 20, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Perth, Ontario", "Title": "\u201cThis hotel was a good experience\u201d", "Author": "RosieRed19", "ReviewID": "UR26673062", "Content": "We were coming off a 9 day cruise and have some time to see San Diego.

AAA) place to stay in Downtown San Diego on a summer weekend--high season. It's located at the border between the financial district of downtown and the lively residential/restaurant area of Little Italy. As previous reviewers have pointed out, the hotel is within blocks of the Amtrak/Coaster station and the Trolley, as well as the main bus spine on Broadway. Since I was staying without a car access to all this transit--as well as the many places I could walk to--was important. Some previous reviewers commented that there were a lot of homeless people around. Maybe I'm just habituated to it, but it didn't seem like a lot to me--maybe a couple on each walk near the hotel. There were areas of the Downtown, particularly around City College, that seemed to me to have a much stronger presence of street people. I disliked the fact that in the downtown direction there weren't many people of any kind around on the weekend, and that there were an awful lot of parking lots to walk by (hopefully a few more highrise condos will get built and get rid of some parking lots!). I was initially put into a low floor (4th) smoking room despite asking for a high floor non-smoking room. The desk folks said they were completely booked Friday night, but at my request on Saturday moved me to a non-smoking room on the 11th floor. Well done. The breakfast seemed pretty hopeless, like so many hotel breakfasts are. There are a lot of more interesting places to eat in San Diego. You get either a city view or a bayside view from any room, since the hotel is built with two lines of rooms on either side of a double loaded corridor. It makes for an ugly building outside but good views, though on the west side you've got to get over the parking structure. There were a lot of young people staying there--as well as foreign tourists--but they seeemed to quiet down late at night. I closed the door to my balcony--the room's \"window\"-- to cut down noise late at night. Contrary to what's been said, there is a pause in train service in the middle of the night, but only from about 1 a.m. to 6 a.m. The room's decor was fine, but not particularly notable.

It certainly isn't a luxurious large scale hotel like the ones near the convention center, but it suffices for downtown convenience. The decor is somewhat outdated as the building appears to be from the early 80s, and the rooms tend to be somewhat shaded and dark as there is a neighboring bank building attached and blocking sunlight. There is still a nice bayview on one side, although as another review mentioned, there is a condo site that will eventually block the view. (So far there is no construction going up as yet.) They were nice enough to give us a bayview room even though we had not requested it. The rooms are a standard size, clean, and the queen size beds were above average IMO for comfiness thanks to a nice mattress pad. The microwave and fridge are convenient, and the clean if non luxurious bathroom has a hairdryer and coffeemaker. Water pressure was weak though for the shower. The location is very good, only a block from the nicest Rite Aid I have ever seen on Kettner and India St, and only a block and a half from the trolley stop that goes to the Gaslamp District (which is also walkable, but a long walk.) The area is safe and clean and right near good eats in Little Italy, and very close to the airport. The train line/trolley line passes next to the bay a couple blocks away and is somewhat noisy, but not enough to wake me from sleep. It might bother very light sleepers though. (It seems the noise is not as bad as with other similar budget hotels like Hampton Inn that are right next to the train line.) The parking is convenient and only $7 a night in a small unattended garage attached to the hotel, so you can come and go as you please. I found plenty of spaces available when I was there, so I didn't have the issues that others have noted finding a space. I didn't find the garage scary or weird either, it was open air and you could just walk down the ramps directly and roll bags along it because it was small.(there is no elevator) A compact car is easier to park given the size of the spaces. The included breakfast coupon is for a continental breakfast at an attached restaurant with sit down service, so you still have to pay tip. There is also a full menu so you can have a more substantial breakfast if you want, and the food was okay. Overall, this is a good value, full service hotel with a convenient downtown location. Staff were all pleasant and cordial. They made a small error with my hotel bill, but had already corrected it themselves by the time I called about it. Make sure to request a nonsmoking room when you reserve, as the hotel does still have smoking rooms too.

Be sure to book through the San Diego Convention and Visitor's website as their rate is far less than the advertised Best Western rate. The convention and visitor's website allows you to select if you want bayview or cityview. Although the site doesn't point this out, be aware that a bayview will cost you an extra $10 a night which you will have to pay on arrival. I was aware of this ahead of time and didn't mind paying the extra $10 when I got there. The bayview is nice, but if you are planning on staying here by mid-summer 2007 the view is likely to be blocked by a new high rise condo development they are building a few blocks away. Before long this hotel will have very little bayview at all. We found this hotel to be quiet and comfortable for our stay in San Diego. The location is convenient to the trolley line. Use the trolley if you are heading to Old Town, Seaport village, the convention center, or Petco Park. If you want to, you could walk to most downtown attractions. San Diego's downtown is not overly large and easily walkable. The hotel pool is small and can be chilly late in the afternoon when it is shaded from the sun. But the hot tub was very relaxing. There is also a courtesy shuttle available at the hotel. We didn't use except for our trip to the airport, but I assume if you ask the front desk, the shuttle would be available to take you to the zoo or other attractions. On the morning of check-in we arrived around noon, but check in wasn't until 3:00. Fortunately, our room was ready and they happily checked us in. The room was clean and offered a microwave and refrigerator. Stop at the rite aid one block away to pick up any alcoholic beverages you may need. Maid service was timely and efficient. Overall, the Best Western Bayside is a quiet and comfortable hotel, a great value for the price in downtown San Diego.

It had two semi-comfy beds,an older TV with an old channel changer that barely worked.The tub had a rust stain in it,and had a constant drip coming out of it.The bathroom was dark as the one of the neon lights was partially burned out.We were woken up at 5:30Am and 6:30Am because the construction equipment outside our window was being moved.

It also didn't recognize or wouldn't allow me access to commonly used websites and got messages about the page may be pornographic,even though they were not. The breakfast at the hotel restaurant wasn't that great,and the two old elevators had an odd smell,like an oil burner to them.Room service was not done cleaning our room by 2:30 the first day,which was a little bit sad considering it wasn't that big of a hotel,nor did it seem nearly full. The price is great,and by no means is this the worst hotel in the world.Just in downtown San Diego it's either cheaper hotels that have their issues,such as this one and the Holiday inn on the Bay,or really nice,expensive hotels like the W or Sheraton.There doesn't appear to be a median hotel.

The hotel was in a great location, perfect for people who didn't have a car there, like us. They have a free \"shuttle\" to and from the airport- more like a minivan with a crazy driver!! All you have to do is call the hotel once you have picked up your bags at the airport and they come in 10 minutes or so. The hotel is pretty standard issue hotel chain quality, although the furniture was fairly new. The room itself was HUGE- we had a king size bed, a couch, coffee table, table w/ 2 chairs, a desk, and a chair w/ ottoman. Plus the room has a mini-fridge and microwave that came in handy for leftovers! We requested an upper floor, per other tripadvisor suggestions, and ended up on the 12th floor so we were all most at the top (14 floors total- expect 14 is really the 13th- stupid superstitions!) We did not pay for the bay view, but our view of the city was great. The balcony is super small, but we liked being able to leave our door open and get fresh air. There is construction surrounding the hotel, and within a short period of time, there will no longer be any bay view rooms. The price of the hotel is reasonable, especially compared to other downtown hotels. We were only 3 blocks from the bay, walking distance to the USS Midway Museum, Seaport Village, and the Gaslamp Quarter. We did not use the hotel pool- it was kind of chilly, but I can tell you that it is not the kind of pool you relax by all day. This is definitely a city hotel! There is a \"free\" breakfast, but you have to go to the Bayside Cafe, which is attached to the hotel, and be seated. You can either get cereal (hot or cold) w/ toast & coffee/tea, or a bakery item (bagel, danish) with juice or coffee/tea. For a small fee you can add on eggs and fruit- we did it one day & it's a lot of food!! Only complaint is that you have to wait for food, and we were eager to get out of there and start the day. The hotel is just blocks from the Cruise Ship Terminal, and the ferry to Coronado Island. We also took advantage of the public Trolley system, which is just a few blocks from the hotel. If you go, visit Karl Strauss Brewery- a block from the hotel, and home of a well-known and enjoyed beer in the San Diego area- good food too!! Not far from the hotel is the Kansas City Barbeque- famous for it's part in Top Gun- Stop by and eat there! The food is great, and it hasn't changed since Tom Cruise was there in 1985!! We also took advice from fellow tripadvisor's and went to Rite Aide to stock up on drinks & that we kept in the room. Overall San Diego is a wonderful city, and this is a great place to stay and see all the sights. We went to the USS Midway Museum, the Zoo, Sea World, Sea Port Village, Old Town San Diego, Coronado Island, etc. It's a great city to see, and the weather is PERFECT!!!", "Date": "April 16, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "illinois", "Title": "\u201cclean and ok for the price, but VERY NOISY!\u201d", "Author": "bianca66", "ReviewID": "UR7282383", "Content": "We stayed here last night, actually, April 3, 2007, a Tuesday night. I had booked thru AAA and failed to specifically request a non-smoking room. That was my fault. The reservation was actually for a city view, but we got a harbor view instead (not complaining) and that kinda made up for being on the smoking floor. We were also just staying for one night before we went to the airport, so smelling the smoke from room next door was tolerable. Pros - 1. The harbor view really is very nice, and the Star of India (about three blocks away, I think) is not blocked at all by other buildings. We arrived just before sunset and it was beautiful setting over the harbor. 2. It is less than a 5 minute drive to the airport. 3. It is walking distance to the harbor area and Little Italy. 4. The parking was 7.00/night. From what I've read, this is fairly reasonable for downtown. And it's right next door. 5. I thought the breakfast at the Bayside Grill next door was just fine, with the vouchers. Coffee was only listed with our option of cereal/milk and toast, but when we asked for juice for our daughter, he brought us all a juice at no charge (in addition to our coffee.) Also - the coffee was very good, and my husband and I are really picky about our coffee. We always bring our won for the room coffeemaker. 6. AAA rate for our room was 129/night. Not bad for a harbor view and breakfast. HOWEVER - Cons- 1. NOISY!!! OMG, even with the windows closed, it was sooo noisy. My 9 yr. old, who normally doesn't even notice urban noise, complained about it. The trolley runs by CONSTANTLY. The Amtrak ran by twice within the first 2 hrs we were there in the evening. A plane flew overhead - really close. The pool was right below our room at ground level - and although we were on the 9th floor, we still heard kids in the pool at 8pm. In the morning, we heard the cruise ships blowing their horns. This was with the windows closed. 2. The TV reception on the 9th floor was awful. ALL OF THE CHANNELS were fuzzy. Not one station was clear. Not one, out of thirty-something channels. 3. Our room was cramped and small, and our bed was uncomfortable - sagged in the middle. The first two, for me, far outweighed the pros, and I don't think I'd be happy staying at this place for a week, or even a few days. Maybe if I was really on a budget, but I would not want to be in the room for long, even if it was non-smoking. I would assume that a lot of hotels downtown and by the harbor would be noisy, but I haven't stayed at those, just this one, and, even with the view, I wasn't that impressed.", "Date": "April 4, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "La Jolla, California", "Title": "\u201cOkay\u201d", "Author": "vanny420", "ReviewID": "UR7260517", "Content": "I stayed two nights mid-week in March. I didn't pay extra$$ for the bay view but got it because just as we got in there was a large group of German tourists who just came in, which probably booked other rooms. The two queen beds were comfortable. and the pillows were nice and fluffy. In fact we saw many being replaced the day we checked in. (They were taking out old mattresses and bringing in new ones.) The amenities are good. A TV with cable, a fridge, microwave, and coffee maker made the fact that there's no continental breakfast easy, since there's a rite-aid down the street we bought hot-pockets and ate those in the morning. The view of the bay is amazing although it's true there is a concstruction sight to the right it's not very noticeable when you have the sun setting and the \"Star of India\" right in front of you. The pool isn't special and the jets on the hottub didn't work very well but the hottub was hot so that was nice after hours of walking. There are towels in the pool area which I also thought was nice. The constuction was not as noisy as people have said, although to be honest my friends and I left our room about 10:30 everyday and returned in the evening 6pm- midnight. Noise is a problem though as there is a railroad crossing a few blocks away, which you can hear clearly even with the balcony window shut. At night, cruise ships dock at the harbor which is also a few blocks away but the boats horn woke me and my friends up. This happened both nights we stayed and the second night two cruise ships came in so we were awakened twice that night!!! I can't imagine any of the other hotels in the area being any better though. There are hotels right across the street from the harbor which I think have to hear the same noise. I believe it's just a consequence of staying in a city. The area of the hotel isn't particularly nice, but it isn't particulary ghetto either. If you walk up India Street like 2 blocks there are a lot of nice little shops and places to eat and drink. (It's Little Italy) You can pretty much walk everywhere you want to go or take a cab - Horton Plaza to the hotel was $4. The parking lot is strangely full. I assumed many construction workers park thier cars there because once they were gone the parking lot cleared up a bit. The lack of an elevator in the parking lot is annoying because the stairs look gross. My friend drove down to the lobby, we took out the luggage and then she drove back up to find parking somewhere. $7 a night for parking is not bad at all, I'm surprised this is even a complaint. We didn't even use the car while in San Diego. We walked to the Harbor and took the Old Town Trolley hop on hop off tour that takes you pretty much everywhere you want to go in the city as a tourist.", "Date": "March 31, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco", "Title": "\u201cOnly Ok....\u201d", "Author": "TravelerS7", "ReviewID": "UR7009306", "Content": "stayed here for one night in March, and while it was ok as a place to sleep, I probably wouldn't return given all of the other choices nearby. The room was just ok, thought it was reasonably sized, with a big fridge, a big TV that didn't work (I didn't get in until late and was too tired to deal with it or to change rooms, so just didn't use the TV), two only moderately comfortable queen beds. Bathroom was a decent size but water pressure somewhat lacking. There is free wireless and it worked very well once I got the user name and password from the desk, which just took a phone call. The room was fairly quiet until construction started in the am, though I could hear some noise from the next room when they used the plumbing. I could also hear traffic noise, even on the 10th floor and with the balcony door closed. Cleanliness seemed to be average. The major problems: 1. PARKING! I am surprised none of the recent reviews mentioned this. I can only guess that the reviewers didn't have cars. There is a parking garage, and contrary to one recent review it is NOT free, though the $7 charge is fairly reasonable by big city standards. HOWEVER, the problem is that the garage is five stories tall, with NO elevator. By the time I arrived the only parking spaces left were on the top floor, so yes, I had to go up and down five flights of stairs, or walk through five levels of the garage, to get to or from my car. I wasn't warned about this by the desk when I checked in (there are three spaces near the lobby for check in but a big sign warns that you will be towed if you leave your car there for longer than 15 minutes), but I had to come back through the lobby to get to my room. Had they even warned me, I would have dropped my luggage in the lobby before driving up to the 5th floor (and then having to walk down five flights with the luggage.). Part of the issue here is that there is no bellman. You are on your own to deal with luggage. On top of that, there is low lighting and no security personnel in the garage, and the garage is very open to the streeet, so it felt a little bit uncomfortable walking through it alone, in addition to being tiring.(the hotel neighborhood isn't awful but it isn't the greatest in the world either). Finally, I wonder if the garage size is adequate for the hotel: the hotel certainly didn't seem very full, but I literally got the second to last space in the place. I wonder what they do if it fills up? Bottom line: this is a convienent location to walking and public transportation, so might be ok for those without cars, but NOT recommended for those with cars. 2. The Elevator: (in the hotel itself): Signs on the elevator said it was working only sporadically, and if it stopped or the door wouldn't close to call the desk on the elevator phone. It worked for me, but this was very disconcerting. The sign said it was 'safe, but a computer issue'. Not particularly reassuring, especially since I notice in prior reviews that it has been broken before. 3. Construction: this was mentioned by others. There was major construction both on the street right below my room, and a new building being built right next door. By 7:00 am, the noise was significant (fortunately I had an early flight). 4. Bayside view: I didn't have a bayside view, so I will have to take the word of others that they are worth the extra $$ charged for it (which is why I didn't take it). However, I am skeptical, and if you do pay extra for it, better get an upper floor: I looked right at some bayside view room balconies from the 5th floor of the garage (which is bayside from the hotel), and could see the same view they were seeing: a bit of bay, framed by three larger hotels in between me and the bay (and of course, they were also looking at the garage). In addition to that, the new building being constructed next door juts out in an L shape from the bayside of the hotel, so EVERY bay view room is going to have a view of a construction site to their right. (the new building being built is about the same height as the hotel). Just a warning not to expect too much. II was glad that I hadn't paid extra for it. In that regard, while I know nothing about the Holiday Inn up the street, it might be worth checking out for those who want views: since it blocks part of the Bayside's view I presume its view is much better!. 5. Pool: is in a very claustrophobic little courtyard; nothing special about it. I could deal with these negatives as I was only there one night, but all of them would really have started to grate on a longer stay.
