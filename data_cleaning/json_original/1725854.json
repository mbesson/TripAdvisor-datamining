We were on the tail end of a 5 week tour of Italy.(plus 3 nights in Paris). We were impressed from the very start. The door was opened for us and check in was friendly and efficient. We booked a JNR suite and it was superb, it had an amazing view of the canal, the bed comfortable and top quality linen. The decor is out of a designer magazine but still homely. Breakfast was excellent, fresh and ample choice. Location is great and just that little bit out of the hustle and bustle to ensure a quiet nights sleep. But above all what makes this hotel our favorite of our trip is the Staff. This is without exception from bell boy to front desk staff day and night. They were all excellent. Helping us with flights, dinner and arranging a surprise gondola ride and dinner for my partner.

Breakfast,well after our last hotel we were a bit wary but the aqua palace came up trumps.

Really pleased we did as we could not find fault with this small boutique style hotel. Well sited approx mid-way between the Rialto Bridge and St Mark's Square - both of which were only a few minutes walk away once we eventually familiarised ourselves with the 'rabbit warren' of passageways and streets that is Venice! Tip:- If arriving by water bus then get off at Rialto Bridge, walk into into the passage ways directly at the end of the bridge, 'dog leg' left and right across the square, go down another passage(s), and cross the next canal; keep going and after you pass another small square on your left look for a sign for Hotel Caneletto on your right ; the Aqua Palace is very close by! (Better still get a good map!) We were not so well informed and nearly got hopelessly lost trying to find the hotel as dusk was falling - nearly resorted to finding a water taxi to take us there! The hotel was lovely, clean, and comfortable; the staff/customer service was excellent. We had a standard double room that overlooked a small quiet square at the back of the hotel but it was spacious, and had a lovely large bathroom. Free wi-fi was available at all times. Outside the room was a very nice landing with seating, and a balcony that overlooked a canal. A comfortable area to relax in. There was no formal restaurant in the hotel - just a small well presented breakfast room - never crowded tho'.

As for the morning noise it was only a one night stay so I can't comment as to how annoying it would be several mornings in a row but my partner and I got great joy from watching the morning daily life outside the hotel. The laundry being collected and delivered, the water bottles being delivered, recycling collection and so on. It is a part of life in Venice that businesses have to have their deliveries and made it more special for us but if it will disturb you I would suggest a hotel room away from the water. Lovely location near to Rialto and St Marks. My advice would be to approach hotel from St Marks as it is a nicer walk. We did both directions several times and the alleys coming from Rialto are harder to locate on the map and quieter. Venice is a safe city but it is still more pleasant arriving to the hotel from St Marks in my opinion. We had little contact with the desk staff as we had planned some trips in advance, but the contact we did have was courteous and professional.

The location is as good as you will get in Venice, halfway between St Marks and the Rialto (less than 5 mins walk to each) but far enough away from each to be quiet and relaxing. Check in was very efficient. When we reserved the room online through an online agent it only showed twin rooms available but on check in they offered to convert the bed to a double whilst we were sightseeing. When making the booking we had also requested a canal view which they accommodated. Our room was number 91 which is on the ground floor just around the corner from reception and next to the water taxi boarding area, and as such we thought it could be noisy, but didn't hear a thing during the stay so this wasn't an issue. The room was clean and spacious, but we would describe it as opulent rather than contemporary as it is marketed - lots of gold colouring! Whilst this was not entirely to our modern taste, it is as close as we think we could get in Venice. The beds weren't the most comfortable we've ever had as they seemed a bit springy but we still slept well. The room had all the essentials including safe, bathroom amenities kit, free Wi-fi (reception will give you the login details), LCD TV and mini bar. The mini bar itself did seem relatively expensive but there was a complimentary bottle of water. Breakfast was buffet style between 7-10.30am and offered the usual selection of cereals, pastries, yoghurts, cold meats and cheeses along with scrambled eggs and bacon. Everything was of decent quality, and the lady in charge was very friendly. She offered hot drinks and was on hand for anything else that was needed. We arrived at around 9.30 and were seated immediately, although a couple who arrived shortly after us did have a 5 minute wait for a table to become free - they were given tea and coffee whilst waiting though. Check out was at 12pm and was as efficient as check in. The hotel also have a luggage area where you can store bags whilst sightseeing if you aren't leaving the city until later in the day. Overall whilst there were a couple of points which stop me giving 5 (springy bed, type of furnishing and lack of bar / additional facilities), I would still highly recommend this hotel.", "Date": "April 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney, Australia", "Title": "\u201cLuxurious Venetian Palace...just perfect!\u201d", "Author": "Lisa210", "ReviewID": "UR127337916", "Content": "Don't look any further...this is it!!!

Sylvia will greet you every morning and look after you well, and is always keen to have a chat with you. All of the staff are very friendly and helpful. We had a slight problem with the return water taxi we had booked, the company did not send a fax confirming the pick up time for the return to the airport and the reception staff kept trying until they got a response. Incidentally, I would still recommend the water taxi company - Venicelink, as they offered one of the cheapest private water taxi services. Pay the extra 40 Euros for arrival via the Grand Canal - worth every cent! When you are in Venice you want to make the most of your time there and so location is important.

My advice re: Venice is to have 80 euro available to spend on a water taxi each way. While the ferry is local to this hotel, Venice is paved and full of bridges making dragging luggage quite an exercise and the ferry is slow. Either this or leave your luggage in lockup at the bus terminal.", "Date": "December 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Leicester, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cPerfect stay in Venice\u201d", "Author": "Sea_sun_lover54", "ReviewID": "UR120876905", "Content": "We loved everything about this hotel.

The only thing that I would mention that I did not find great about the hotel is that when you check in they give you a list of services and tours they can book for you and one is a tour of the islands. They say it is free and you will have a taxi pick you up and take you there. We left around 11 am and the water taxi picked us up, and that was great because we could see more of venice from a boat, but when they drop you off at a glass factory they make you take a tour of the factory and they show you demonstrations of how to blow glass. That was great, but then afterwards I felt that they were very pushy and pressuring you to buy pieces (which were quite pricey!).

The rooms are small, in our case with no view (view and sunlight blocked by another hotel next door) - but that's standard among hotels in Venice and I was aware of that and not complaining because the room was always clean. If you need a spacious room with a sun deck and a beautiful guest accessible garden, I recommend the 4 stars hotels in Certosa or Giudecca islands.

Our two and half hour train trip stretched into almost five hours due to delays in train service between Venice and Milan that were due to factors beyond the control of the train service. We had e-mailed Aqua Palace to let them know that we would be delayed and upon our arrival the fron desk upgraded us to a Junior Suite, room 404 that turned out to be one of the largest hotels rooms we have ever stayed in, not just in Europe, but in North America as well. As others have noted, the room furnishings are sophisticated and elegant, a large and luxurious bathroom with a walk-in shower, small casement windows that opened onto 'mock' balcony with views along a good length of the canal looking over two bridges and other buildings on the canal with roof top terraces and gardens. One of the joys was waking up to the ringing of the bells in the various bell towers and churches around the city - no alarm clock is required. With our view over the canal, you also became very aware that the canals are not just for gondola rides but are the life blood of the city as goods are delivered and waste taken away. Over the last several years of travel through England, France and italy we have chosen to stay at boutique hotels rather than the larger hotels because we have found that in almost ever instance, the boutique hotel is able to provide us with a personalized service that includes attention to details, great style, decor, ambience without costing a fortune. Aqua Palace excels in all of these respects from the personalized service. - from the young lady in the breakfast room that every morning made us feel welcome to the front desk staff that always had a smile when we left our key or picked our key up on our return, to the recommendations for restaurants such as Osteria Ae Sconte and as mentioned earlier the elegance of the rooms, decor, etc. As one reviewer has noted \"It's all about value\" One of the reasons we selected Aqua Palace was its central location, midway between the Rialto Bridge and San Marco. We had purchased 'Brunetti's Venice' as our guide book for Venice with its numerous walks around Venice. Aqua Palace was a perfect starting point for the various walks because it is central to all parts of Venice - no part of Venice is that far away and it is easy to walk everywhere. We would recommend Brunetti's Venice as a guide book - the maps are extremely detailed, although we did get lost a few times - which is part of the joy of exploring Venice. Sometimes you have to get lost in order to find the real Venice, not just the areas frequented by the hoards of tourists. Some of our favourite moments were sitting in a square, sipping a glass of wine and watching everyday Venetians enjoying a sunny Sunday afternoon. We spent four days in Venice at Aqua Palace, part of a nine day stay in Italy, and part of a five week adventure that took us from London to St. Ives, Cornwall, to Italy (Milan, Venice & Florence) to Paris and finally to New York City. We have enjoyed all of the city's that we experienced in our five week sojourn, but especially Venice - staying at Aqua Palace made it easy to fall in love with Venice - we will return.", "Date": "October 24, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney", "Title": "\u201cLovely hotel in great location\u201d", "Author": "meliss777", "ReviewID": "UR84679017", "Content": "We had a great stay as a family at the Aqua Palace.

Several years ago, the property was acquired by the Caputo family, who began the monumental task of completely transforming a 16th century building into a 21st century luxury hotel. The restoration now complete, the Aqua Palace is without a doubt the finest small boutique hotel in Venice. With 30 rooms and suites on 4 floors, the ambiance is one of quiet elegance, using a palate of rich dark colors. Our room (#304 - a Junior Suite) was a gorgeous corner room with 3 large windows overlooking the 2 canals and a small bridge. It was decorated in a modern classic style with a touch of Venetian elegance, with sumptuous chocolate and gold brocade covering the walls. The room also had all of the modern amenities such as free Wi-Fi service and a flat screen TV mounted on the wall. The bathroom had floor to ceiling white and grey marble, a huge shower (with 2 showerheads), a bidet and a monogrammed toiletry bag filled with goodies. It was one of the most luxurious and functional bathrooms we have ever seen in a hotel, which was all the more remarkable because this is a 16th century building. The lobby and public areas of the hotel are clad in fine marble and wood with huge wooden beams supporting the high ceilings and herringbone wood festooning the floors. Rich velvet drapes line the upstairs hallways near the huge French doors, opening out to a romantic balcony, overlooking the canals \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a perfect place to enjoy a glass of champagne. We arrived fairly early and were happy to find our room ready and waiting for us. The hotel staff was extremely helpful and suggested the nearby Osteria Ae Sconte for lunch. After telling the restaurant we had come from the Aqua Palace, we were treated like royalty and given complementary champagne before we dined on some of the best food in Venice. One of the best things to do in Venice is to wander and explore the streets and alleys of the city. The Aqua Palace has one of the best locations in Venice, midway between the Rialto Bridge and the Piazza San Marco, a fascinating 5-minute walk to either. Located on a small canal in the Castello quarter of the city, the Aqua Palace is not only conveniently located, but is in a quiet part of the city away from the crowds. The bilingual staff at the front desk was very helpful suggesting and arranging activities for our stay. They scheduled tickets for a wonderful Vivaldi concert at the Scuola Grande di San Teodoro, arranged a free pick up and tour of Murano and made reservations for us at some outstanding restaurants (one of our favorites was L\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Osteria di Santa Marina). The hotel has an entrance on the canal and is a good place to embark on a gondola ride through the small canals of the city. Even though the hotel was beautiful, the service outstanding and the location perfect, I think the best thing about the Aqua Palace was the breakfast. The breakfast is served in a small, intimate dining room off the lobby. A buffet of scrambled eggs, hot sausages, cheeses and meats, fresh fruit and yogurt, assorted cereals and muesli is artfully arranged next to a selection of fresh breads, croissants and pastries. A delightful hostess serves hot coffee, cappuccino and tea at your table. I have seldom looked forward to a hotel breakfast as much as at the Aqua Palace and I would go back there for no other reason than the delicious chocolate croissants. It was easy to get to the airport for our return home. We walked to the vaporetto stop near the Rialto Bridge (this is a different stop than the main Rialto Bridge stop - just next to the main stop). There is a non-stop vaporetto right to the airport - inexpensive and easy. Our stay at the Aqua Palace was as close to perfect as a hotel can be. If you want a small and intimate hotel located in the center of Venice, with old-world ambience and modern facilities, with a friendly and helpful staff, a great breakfast and reasonable price, you could do no better than the Aqua Palace.", "Date": "October 4, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Germany", "Title": "\u201cFeel like a doge\u201d", "Author": "Zorro7770", "ReviewID": "UR82007363", "Content": "The Aqua Palace is one of these unique boutique hotels you will never forget in your whole life.

As such I was looking for a hotel with a good blend of Venetian opulence and style, location and price. I must have looked at pretty much all of the top hotels before this little gem popped up on the radar! It appears that the hotel was only newly opened about 4/5 months ago and so there were no reviews initially. The website however made it sound absolutely perfect, so I waited for a couple of reviews to come through before taking a chance and booking. I could not have made a better decision! From the moment I booked, the management were extremely helpful and arranged for a hostess to meet us at the airport with a water taxi. The hostess was very welcoming and friendly and it was useful to be provided with hints and tips on getting around Venice. Upon arriving at Venice from Marco Polo the hostess hopped off the taxi and we were privately taxied down the gorgeous Venetian canals to arrive at our hotel, what a way to arrive! Although a little pricey we considered it to be worth it for the experience and ease of arrival! The hotel itself is beautifully decorated with luxury furnishings throughout and lots of lovely seating areas on each floor, most with a terrace overlooking the canal beneath. We had the junior suite on floor 4 and, as expected, this too was perfect and really does look as good as the website (better if I'm honest!), with a great view out over the canal. The bouquet of flowers that I had arranged for our arrival was also beautiful (and enormous!). Although there is no bar at the hotel this was by no means an issue, we simply ordered a couple of glasses of Prosecco and went down to sit in a secluded little seating area on the ground floor which was right by the canal and looked out at the nearby bridge. It felt like our very own little piece of Venice and was just the perfect place to enjoy a glass of fizz as the sun went down with people passing on Gondolas (jealously looking in at our spot of heaven!)!! Location wise the hotel could not be better situated with San Marco's basilica and the Rialto bridge being only a mere 4 minute stroll away. The streets can be tricky to navigate, so I would recommend purchasing a good guide book before you go, certainly our navigation skills deteriorated after a glass or 2 of the local Spritz! Penultimately, the staff - they were all so welcoming, friendly and helpful. In particular when we went down for breakfast, there is a lovely lady who would always give you a friendly morning welcome, which really was a nice way to start the day, so a special thanks to her!! Also the management at reception were so knowledgeable and it made life much easier being able to simply ask them if when we had any queries. Finally, Venice itself - what an amazing place, although it is painted as expensive there are plenty of ways to really enjoy it without spending a fortune, in particular look our for the local \"cichetti\" at many of the local bars, amazing food (similar to Spanish tapas). Also don't just do all the usual tourist trips, it is simply enough to get lost down the back streets, grab a glass of Spritz and escape the tourists!! Apologies for the long review but this hotel really was worth and we can't wait for the next excuse to visit Aqua Palace again!! Thanks for our wonderful stay.
