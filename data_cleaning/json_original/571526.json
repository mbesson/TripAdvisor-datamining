The breakfast in the morning was the best out of Rome & Florence. We had a nice omelet, fresh fruit, pastries, yogurt & juice. They also had a very good dinnner!

The location of the hotel is perfect, literally steps to the grand canal and the main square.

We often saw people wheeling suitcases long distances along small streets and thought how lucky we were to be so close to the San Zaccaria stop. We did make use of the terrace and it was wonderful for a late afternoon glass of wine to stop and smell the roses before getting ready for dinner. The room had everything we needed and was lovely and clean. Again, I would have liked enough room to not live out of my suitcase but again it's a small negative. The breakfast was lovely, the position perfect and I can't say enough about the help given by Susannah. Her English is wonderful (sadly we all expect this when we shouldn't) and she was the most helpful person you would ever meet.

We were packed for a 3 week trip in Italy, but we still only packed a small suitcase each. Fortunately, we were able to squeeze our suitcases under the bed so we could avoid walking on or around them. We did enjoy the balcony each day to sit outside and read when not out and about. The other downside to our room was the bathroom, again small. The shower the size of a phone booth and your knees would be against the opposite wall when sitting on the throne. These issues really did not bother my wife and I, but I think it can be very useful for someone who is a larger sized person. We have a friend who is quite large (6' 5\" 300lbs) and we kept thinking he could not fit in the shower or the bathroom comfortably.

It is in large part due to our stay in Venice. Ca' dei Dogi was a perfect find and quite reasonably priced. We drove through Europe and parked in a parking lot outside of Venice. Cars are not allowed. The train would have taken us to the same location, and then you take a water bus to your stop. We got off on the wrong stop, had to walk a little and caught the next water bus to get to the right stop. It was after 7 and already quite dark. At first it feels a little scary to walk through with your luggage, but we stopped at a store to get directions, and the store owner spoke English and got us quickly back on track. We were a little apprehensive about going down the Calle degli Albanesi because it looks like narrow alley, but the sensor lights came on and guided us through the to the front door. You learn very quickly that these alleyways and paths are part of Venice's unique charm. You have to be buzzed in, and once you get your keys, you are able to open the front door with them. The location is so close to St. Mark's Square and the water taxis, so it's very convenient, but at the same time very quiet. We chose the room with the circular blue windows. We were on the top floor, and there is no elevator. My teenage daughter loved staying in this room. She said it was spacious for just her, and the room was quite cozy. It is a boutique hotel, and even though we had enough room, I hate when people say that these kinds of places are too small. We had the other room with a television and view of the inner courtyard. It was too cold in December to partake in the balcony and rooftop terrace, but it would provide a lovely setting for coffee or resting from the day's activities. There is one computer with free Internet access, and if no one else is looking to use the computer, it was enough. I tried to use it later in the evening and no one else was around. They had a shelf of tour books you can borrow and pamphlets to help plan your outings. Breakfast and service were great. They went out of their way to make us great omelettes and cappuccinos. We also had breads, marmalade, cheese, Nutella, and juice. The staff was very nice and made us feel very comfortable. The hotel owner was great and arranged a free taxi for us to Murano. You should know that any factory tours include a sales pitch at the end, and the water taxi back to your hotel is not free. We took a water bus back and it was fine, but it took a lot longer than the direct water taxi, which is faster but costs a lot more, and is not as scenic.

The hotel is conveniently situated right in the heart of historic Venice, just by the main square of Piazza San Marco which includes architectural gem and one of the most important structures in all of Europe, majestic Basilica di San Marco. It is also bordered by Palazzo Ducale \u00e2\u20ac\u201c seat of Venice\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s governing body for centuries where it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s said the infamous Casanova was once imprisoned, and several of Venice\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s other highlights. Ca Dei Dogi features 6 rooms all individual decorated to create a more personalized experience for each visitor. They appear to have been recently renovated (at least mine was \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a single which though a tad teeny, quite practical enough), and comes equipped with the standards: minibar, coffee/tea, safe, flat panel TVs (including some English channels which seems to be a rarity in Italy) and extra bedding, of course, if needed.

So, it's a very, very convenient base to explore Venice. The ferry stop (San Zaccaria) is less than a minute walk from the hotel. Even though the hotel is so close to Piazza San Marco, it is located in an alley that is very quiet so you can definitely get a good night's sleep. I recommend spending some time (coffee/tea time) on the rooftop terrace while enjoying the sound of the bells of San Marco. It's a very relaxing and tranquil experience for me. Secondly, everyone working there is sincerely warm and helpful. Susanna welcomed me on my first day and gave me tons of useful information about shopping for souvenirs, particularly, Murano glass. Please don't hesitate to ask her for advice, she will do it wholeheartedly, patiently, and with a big smile. I also got to check-in earlier since the room was already ready! What a welcome relief since I just had an early morning 2-hour train ride from Florence! Stefano was also very friendly and patient with all my inquiries. I tend to ask many questions but these people deserve awards for patience and helpfulness. Michael, the night manager, was also very helpful and friendly. He prepares the breakfast for the guests and makes a very yummy omelet. Thirdly, the room...I stayed in a single room which had a view of the front of the hotel. It was small BUT it was just perfect for me. The room smelled nice (like cinnamon, which I adore) and was immaculate. Thanks to Ruby, the housekeeping staff! You also get free coffee and tea in the room. The bathroom is up to the standards of a 5-star hotel. It's big enough for one person and everything was so shiny and clean. I could have moved in to that room permanently if given the chance. Fourthly, I recommend eating at the restaurant Taverna de Dogi, which is adjacent to the hotel. From what I have heard, this restaurant was started by the hotel owner's parents and it's very popular with tour groups. But, don't let this deter you from going there because even for a solo diner like me, they were able to give me a secluded spot to enjoy my meal. I recommend the risotto con nero (not sure about the spelling but it is rice with the ink from cuttlefish) and tiramisu. Very delicious!

Ca' dei Dogi is in a wonderful location - literally about a 2 minute walk from Piazza San Marco, as well as both the San Marco and San Zaccaria vaporetto stops, yet still tucked away in an alleyway that offers seclusion and a quiet reprieve from the large crowds of tourists. From the terrace attached to our room, we could see the Doge's Palace - just on the backside of the building across from us - and the Campanile tower just beyond that. It is also a very short walk to the Rialto Bridge/Grand Canal, with the route clearly marked by arrows from Piazza San Marco. (These arrows also made it nice if you got lost because there was another set pointing back to Piazza San Marco and it's very easy to find your way back to the hotel from there.) We stayed in the Batik room. It was quite small, but not impossibly small. We traveled with two carry-on sized roller bags and a small backpack, and we had no trouble whatsoever fitting all of our luggage in the room with space to still move around. It's not the largest hotel room around, but it has the basics, and isn't by any means a closet. The bed was a little hard for our liking, but we found this to be the case everywhere we stayed in Italy. The bathroom is also quite small - very long and narrow without much space to move around - but it has the basics, and was very clean and functional. Our room had a small terrace with a table and two chairs. The terrace was fairly small as well, but very nice for the two of us to sit and enjoy a glass of wine and our surroundings in the evenings. There was also a small TV, though it only had one channel in English (BBC), and free wireless internet on the first floor. We took our laptop down to the cafe outside, but there is also a computer in the lobby for guests' use (free of charge). There is also a restaurant attached to the hotel. The restaurant serves continental breakfast in the mornings, included in the price of the room. We had huge, delicious omelets cooked any way we wanted, croissants, fruit, yogurt, coffee, juice - way more food than we could even eat. We also ate dinner in the restaurant one night - it is a 10% discount for guests - and the food was really good. We got great service and the prices were decent as well. Overall, despite the somewhat small quarters of the room, we loved our stay at Ca' dei Dogi.

Also, we went to Lido and rented bikes, which Susanna helped us arrange. It was the perfect way to spend a day!! We had a Superior Room one night and a Jacuzzi Room the second night. I preferred the Superior Room (less expensive, actually) as it had a sweet sitting room and a nice shower with lots of shower heads. The Jacuzzi room had a bigger bathroom but only a bathtub, no shower. And the bed in the Superior Room was softer than the bed in the Jacuzzi room. The breakfast was awesome- great croissants, nutella, lovely fruit salad and yogurt, and omelets if you want. The cappuccinos were dark and strong.

DEFINITELY RECOMMENDED. Pros - We were very lucky to get upgraded to the apartment, but from what we saw, all the rooms would be furnished the same. Modern furnishings and very clean. Owner Stefano has a Japanese wife and that standard of Japanese cleanliness shows through! Definitely more like 4 star than 3 star. If you are luck enough to have the apartment, it is very spacious and even has a gorgeous terrace looking out to the palace - LOCATION! Hidden just round the corner from St Marks square, close to so many restaurants etc. I would have expected to pay so much more to have such a central location. And it's not that hard to find - down a small quiet alley...just that the street sign you turn down to get to the hotel may not be obvious walking from the vaporetto stop (the street sign is visible if you walk in the other direction ie from St Marks square) - Service - Susanna at the front desk was very helpful...probably the best service we had in all of Italy. The owner Stefano was lovely too and dropped by at our dinner at the restaurant to offer free aperitif and post-dinner drinks! The restaurant staff were all very nice too. All very personalised too seeing there are only 6 rooms I think? - Value - really just astounding value....i have paid a lot more before for a lot less...and seen many 4 and even 5 star places that are worse.

Wouldn't rave about the breakfast, but again it was served with a smile in their nice little courtyard. Other small negative was that our room was on the top floor (below the terrace). It was a bit noisy when one of our fellow guests decided they'd have a late night up there.

The room was small with twin beds. It was equipped with the flat screen TV, desk area, safe and wardrobe area.

But if you are ........ then you come out into a light and airy apartment which is up above most of the surrounding buildings. The view is not spectacular, mainly rooftops, but it does mean you are not looking out onto a narrow alleyway, which is what most rooms in Venice do. Instead you have plenty of fresh air. We were there in May when the weather was quite warm, and did not need the air con on - the breeze through the windows was sufficient to keep the apartment pleasantly cool. The apartment is very spacious. There is a kitchen / diner / lounge, not luxurious but quite comfortable and large, with a small private balcony which is very nice to retreat to in the middle of the day when Venice is full of trippers. There is a small modern bathroom (shower, no bath), a smallish bedroom with masses of storage space, all connected by a spacious hall (where you can store luggage etc). Breakfast is in the hotel, which is just across the alleyway. Quite good for a continental breakfast. You could though consider making your own in the kitchen of the flat if you wished. Location is very good, just behind the Doge's Palace, so two minutes walk from Saint Mark's Square and 100 metres from the vaporetto stop. Some people have commented on the price of the flat.

The hotel is relatively expensive, has incredibly small rooms and a breakfast offering that provides almost no choice and is served in a characterless room a small as a cloakroom! However, given its location I would still recommend it. Having not stayed elsewhere in Venice, I can't really compare it to other Venetian B&Bs, but, for example, Il Villino in Firenze offered much more charm, large and airy rooms, and a far better b'fast experience, for a comparable price. I guess this is what I was hoping for from Ca' d D and why we chose a B&B over a hotel, so I was understandably a little disappointed. Providing you temper your expectations, the fact that the service is hospitable and charming and the booking and check in is smooth and efficient, it will probably leave you with a very positive impression. It's also worth pointing out that although it's only maybe one minute's walk from the ferry stops and the Doges palace, the hotel is quietly tucked away. The best of both worlds. My travel tip would be to get a 48hr/72hr travel card from the ferry stop @ San Zaccaria and use it. It's the best value the city has to offer. With this you can float up and down the grand canal and visit all the islands via public transport, you can also get back to the airport using Vap #52 and then the #5 bus from Pi. Roma stop (although shelling out on a water taxi is well worth it for the trip in). Best lunchtime dining tip, take in a leisurely lunch in Dorsoduro, get off @ Academie and walk to the many good neighbourhood restaurants there overlooking the island of La Giudecca. Eating out in Venice (San Marco/Rialto area) is outrageously expensive and not all that good. Average food, compounded by the \u00c2\u00a3/Euro exchange rate meant that we were very disappointed with the food/value in the restaurants we tried, even after careful online research. I'd say many of the recommendations are the best of a bad bunch, a shame when in other Italian cities the food can be fantastic! Much better to wander around back streets of residential neighbourhoods and grab what the locals are eating - tapas style. Just be prepared to be disappointed at dinner (especially on a Sunday, when anything decent seems to be shut). The one exception to our dining disappointment was Corte Sconta (also shut on Sunday), which we ate at on our first night.

Again, the room was very small indeed but did have a window onto the alleyway entrance. The bathroom was pretty new but small and anyone tall sitting on the toilet would have to sit sideways! I cannot recommend the hotel for people with disabilities or, at least for the two rooms seen, for families with children.

The saying goes that location is everything and you can certainly say this is true of Ca' dei Dogi. The hotel is just 2 minutes walk from San Marco which couldn't be better. Nearby is a waterbus stop from which you can hop on and explore Venice and other islands such as Murano. It is also very convenient if you arrive at Marc O'Polo airport as the waterbus service from the airport drops you just a few minutes walk from the hotel. We stayed in rooms 202 and 302, a single and a double and paid 100Euros and 160Euros respectively. Which I think for mid-season and location is a good price. The rooms are on the small side but beautifully furnished and very clean. The bathrooms especially are lovely. There is a small roof terrace available for all the guests too. Breakfast was fine with pastries, orange juice, omelete, yoghurt, coffee etc. A couple of tips; get up early before breakfast and go to San Marco before the crowds appear - it is magical. And if you have time go to Murano island which has dozens of shops selling some of the best Murano glass you will find.

A couple of minutes walk from the San Zaccaria waterbus stop on the busy Riva Schiavoni and just round the corner from San Marco, but very quiet (except for the occasional song from a gondolier entertaining his passengers, there's a canal nearby). We arrived early expecting to ditch our bags in the lobby and go out, but we were welcomed with a glass of Prosecco and shown to our rooms soon after. The level of service is exceptional; nothing was too much trouble. Stefano and Susanna recommended restaurants, reserved tables and made a concert booking for us; in the breakfast room we were given helpings of a delicious chocolatey tiramisu as an unasked for bonus! We stayed in Room 101, which a recent occupant was not very happy with. It is small, but with a high ceiling. We thought the hotel had made a good use of the available space by putting the twin beds up on a higher level (just a few steps) and creating storage space underneath, which was quite adequate for our bags, plus a wardrobe. The bathroom was no smaller than many we have had, and there was a rail on the wall to which the shower head could be attached, so a 'stand up' shower was possible. Our only criticism would be that the windows are small and too high up on the wall to look out, although this isn't a huge problem when you aren't spending much time in there. From this point of view we felt our friends in the first floor double economy room (201?) were better off. However, we were invited to use the roof terrace, which was super.

They couldn't have tried harder to please us and be of service. We also found the room to be nicely appointed and immaculate. That said, our first floor economy double(Room 101) just off the reception desk was much smaller still than I expected and frankly an uncomfortable fit for two people in my opinion. The hotel offered several times, to upgrade us the last night of our 3 night stay at the same price as a superior room but we just didn't feel like repacking for one night. It should be noted that my wife and I only had 2 small Rick Steves style backpacks(one for each of us), so I don't know what most people schlepping everything but the kitchen sink do when they get this room??? This room comes with a tiny and I mean tiny bathroom. The shower head is on a cable like most Euro hotels but is attached to the tub so you have to hand hold it the whole time if you choose to stand up rather than take a bath. We never take baths in hotels so this was a real inconvenience for my wife and I. This room was barely bigger than our adult son's single room 302 which we were envious of. His single room felt a lot more spacious than our economy double and was cheaper than our room. His single also had a stand up shower stall. My wife joked about going up to use Joe's shower everyday. All of that said, this hotel was terriffic on many other levels like service, attitude, cleanliness and location. Our room even though on the first floor was extremely quiet and came with a double door to insure quietness. I would strongly recommend that you not book here if this room is your option unless you don't mind a very tight space. I told the hotel that in my opinion this should be the cheapest room in the hotel and sell for the same price as a single due to its small size and the lack of a stand up shower. That said, we would love to come back here and stay in one of their larger rooms on a higher floor.

What a fabulous location, steps from the vaporetto and St. Marks, there were 6 of us on this leg of the trip, and we all fell in love with Ca' Dei Dogi AND the lovely Susanna (and Stefano and everyone else associated). Just as with a previous reviewer, Susanna had to come to our rescue when we had the wrong train station for the day of our departure (beware....Venezia Maestre is NOT the train station in the heart of the town...). Susanna also steered us toward excellent restaurants, we were not let down. If you are reading this review, Susanna, thank you from Charlene & gang...we appreciate everything you did.

Our (adult) son and daughter had the main floor twin bed room - it was outfitted similar to a cabin on a sailboat, and was very cozy and interestingly laid out, they loved it. My husband and I had the Jacuzzi suite with a small balcony on the 3rd floor - perfect. My best friend and her daughter occupied a superior suite on the top floor, which had a separate twin bed..again, perfect for our needs. There's also a terrace where everyone could gather for a drink.

Value - the price in my opinion is fairly low and could realistically be 20%-30% higher. i wouldnt be surprised to see prices go higher since they're always booked but even if they were ~300 euro/night, I'd stay there without hesitation. Comparable options both in price and quality are not easy to come by. 4. Rooms - the two rooms I saw were very nicely appointed with a modern flare. keep in mind, US standards are different so the beds will be more firm, rooms will be somewhat small, and pillows will be flattish. that being said, they still exceeded our expectations significantly. as i said at the beginning, book this hotel without any hesitation at all if you have the opportunity. this hotel is the definition of why tripadvisor is a successful website today (people want to find relatively unknown but yet great places to stay) - ca' dei dogi is a gem in a city filled with many run down, tourist trap type hotels.", "Date": "June 2, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Suffolk, VA", "Title": "\u201cPerfetto!\u201d", "Author": "SaraSuffolk", "ReviewID": "UR16497076", "Content": "We stayed here for 2 nights in the Double Economy room. Based on the reviews and the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153economy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd classification, we expected the room to be a bit on the small side so we were not surprised or disappointed. The room has a double bed (queen sized, I think) which is pushed into the corner of the room. There is an L-shaped walkway around the bed to get to the bathroom. The room is beautifully decorated, as is the rest of the hotel, and was perfect for us. We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need a huge room as we prefer to spend most of our time sightseeing.

The hotel has a beautiful rooftop patio with several chairs and a table with an umbrella. It is surrounded with beautiful plants and flowers, with views of the Doge\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Palace, and was the perfect place for relaxing. At night, we enjoyed a glass of wine while listening to the live music being played at St. Mark\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s square. It was magical and, we thought, a much better option than fighting the crowds and overpriced establishments on the square. As an American, good deals and values are hard to find in Italy, with the dollar being so weak.

I also appreciated the restaurant, especially upon arrival after a very long travel day. The location, just around the corner from the bustling St. Mark's square, offers a kind of oasis of quiet and privacy. I loved the views from the apartment of the Doge Palace, St. Mark's bell tower, the cupolas of the basilica, Castello's skyline, the charm of tiled rooftops.

The five of us -- 85-year old mother, her three daughters, and 8 year old granddaughter -- stayed in 4 of the rooms for 4 nights, and we could not have been happier. We arrived at the train station & took the water bus to the San Zaccharia stop, then took a very short walk to the small alley way leading to the hotel. Susanna warmly greeted us and took over all the details of our checking in, while seating us outside on the patio with complimentary proseco (and a coke for our young traveler). The rooms were beautifully decorated -- and even my room (the small single room, 301, on the third floor) was very comfortable, with every convenience. The breakfasts were very good, with whatever coffee you asked for (I always had the scrumptious capuccino), blood orange juice and water, fruit salad, brioche, and omelettes to order (really delicious). Susanna was fabulous with suggestions and directions, and she even straightened out a problem I had with an online ticket agent, from whom I bought tickets in the U.S. for the secret tour of the Doges Palace. (And she knew exactly where to go for a less expensive, beautiful gondola ride, which was one of the highlights of our trip). All of the hotel staff were superb -- particularly the young man who helped us with our luggage and with breakfast, even at 4 am in the morning on our day of departure, when we had an early morning flight. We loved eating dinner at the hotel's Taverna dei Dogi one night -- let the waiter choose appetizers and the main course for you and relax and enjoy a fabulous seafood dinner. If you want to splurge another night, go to the nearby Hotel Metropole on the Grand Canal and order the \"Surprise\" tasting menu for 95 E each -- it made for a very special last night's dinner in Venice.

Nothing seems to be too much trouble, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had a very relaxing and enjoyable week. We rented their \"Apartment Sole\" (Sun Apartment) on the top floor of a small building just across the twisty passageway from the main hotel. Its quite a climb to the top (78 steps) but well worth it, comprising a modern well equipped living room/kitchen/diner, shower/bathroom, small cosy bedroom with a wide king-size bed and a terrace looking out over the rooftops and the Bridge of Sighs to the Dogi's Palace. As I type, the air conditioning refuses to go cold, but I'm sure its operator error and Stefano will be able to tell me what I'm doing wrong tomorrow after breakfast, which incidentally is most Venetian (coffee how-you-like-it and brioche) plus fruit salad, juice, and yoghurt. Omelette is on offer too. Anyway, for now, I just open some windows which are rather splendid powered velux affairs. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hard resisting the temptation to play. The kitchen has most things you need for home-made snacks and take-aways if you want to reduce your dining-out budget. In fact, I'd say its probably the cheapest way of staying in the heart of Venice for a week costing about the same as a hotel room per night but affording much greater comfort (as long as you don't mind the stairs). We've been able to have some meals in and some out. When it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very easy to spend \u00e2\u201a\u00ac80 on a modest restaurant meal around here, the occasional take-away pizza helps balance the finances. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a good but small supermarket a few streets away in San Lio and S&S can provide directions. The weather has been mixed this week (April 9-16, 2008) and we've been able to enjoy the sun terrace as well as dry-out the wet shoes, coats and trousers much more easily than in a hotel. Other reviews here have fully described the marvelous location so I won't go into that except to say that its quite magical being able to just pop out for ten minutes for a stroll around San Marco. What else can I add?: If you are going in the near future be aware that building work is happening next door at the same level. So Mon-Fri there has been constant noise of drills, saws and shouting. Having said that, we've not found it obtrusive as it is going on inside the building rather than on the scaffolding outside. In fact, it's provided some entertainment, especially when nobody could find Giovanni one day. Also, if you like long drinks of tea or coffee take your own mugs. Italians don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do long hot drinks its not part of the culture and Suzanna didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have anything that would suffice in the restaurant either. We eventually tracked some down in a local hardware shop. Other recommendations: There's quite a bit of debate, I notice, as to whether a Venice Card is worth the \u00e2\u201a\u00ac80 (orange variety). I'd say most definitely yes, especially now that single journey rate is \u00e2\u201a\u00ac6.50 and the loos cost \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1 per pee. Pre-book it on the web anyway and pay up front as well, if you trust the rather idiosyncratic ACTV web site. I read a review that stated restaurant owners in the vicinity of San Marco view their clientele as \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcone-shot\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 prey and consequently there is no need for them to provide value for money. Sadly it seems to be true, at least, in our experience this week. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d single some out but it seems unfair. Basically take what you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d pay in UK pounds for any item (even coffee) double it and that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll pay in Euros in the San Marco area. But head away from that area and you will eventually get value for money. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d wholeheartedly recommend the Taverna San Trovaso near the Accademia bridge, which although not cheap you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mind parting with the cash as the ambience and food are superb. Lastly, your average Venetian is a really nice patient, tolerant and pleasant guy. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been immensely impressed with the helpful way the public transport staff, museum people and locals put up with hordes of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcstrangeros\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 like us invading their wonderful city and fumbling about with their magnificent language.", "Date": "April 19, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "st. paul, mn", "Title": "\u201cgreat hotel\u201d", "Author": "trveler50", "ReviewID": "UR15128458", "Content": "Great hotel in the middle of the Venice tourist scene.

They called Stephano, and he met us within two minutes. It was a short, short walk down an alley and we were there. No dragging the luggage forever through streets. He carried my luggage upstairs (poor guy). We were so surprised to see our double room with balconey. It was modern, pristine, fresh smelling and clean. The bathroom was gorgeous. It felt luxurious and comforting. There was a safe, phone, a window, balconey and a stocked mini bar. We were in heaven. Stephano is so, so professional, helpful and kind. The breakfast was fine. We ordered 3 coffee's each (and no they did not look at us funny or feel put out), fresh fruit, rolls, toast, juice, yogurt and omlette. We were not hungry for hours. Our waiter was always kind, all smiles and asked if we wanted more coffee, and so forth. They made us feel welcome, like guests, and treated us with smiles and kindness around every corner. The location is next to none, I could see doges palace outside of my balconey, and it was minutes (less than 5 ) on foot. Stephano went out of his way making dinner reservations, mapping us out and teaching us about the Italian government.

My single room was tiny as everyone has described, but had everything I needed and was simple and modern. Didn't miss the lack of space at all. Even though the room was small, the bathroom, although not huge, was bigger than I expected considering the room size. Shower was actually pretty big by Italy standards! We buzzed at the door when we arrived, and Stefano was there within a minute or so. There is no elevator, but he had someone bring the luggage up the stairs to our rooms. Other than that, there was generally someone (Stefano or Susanna) at the desk in the morning, but we were given a key to the outside door, as the rest of the day there usually wasn't anyone there, although they did tell us we could bug them at their restaurant next door if we needed anything. We didn't want to bother them, but keep this in mind if you are wanting any information - ask in the morning. Breakfast was bigger than a previous review stated. They might have arrived early? Started at 8am if I remember correctly, and the tables were already set with fruit salad and melba toasts upon arrival, but then when you sat down, they would bring out yogurt, cornetti, and offer you a capuccino and an omlette. Probably one of the best things about the hotel is the proximity to Piazza San Marco - right around the corner. Not only was it a great location (especially for a first visit to Venice), but it was easy to find too. Just follow all the signs to Piazza San Marco... Surprisingly, the hotel was really quiet. Couldn't hear any outside noise (or from other rooms either) at all. Other than that, the price was really reasonable for Venice. I believe I paid around 100 Euro per night for my single room, think my sister and brother-in-law paid about 150 per night for their double.

The rate included a wonderful breakfast of juice, croissants, yogurt, fruit salad, and eggs made to order. The best part of the hotel was that is was absolutely quiet - a difficult task in a city as crowded as Venice. The location couldn't be beat as it was central to everything and very easy to return to at the end of a long day of walking and sightseeing. Stefano and Susanna at the front desk were amazing. There was no task too small for them to help us with. They were especially gracious when we wanted to email and fax a store in Greece to get bills for items we purchased. The service we got was better than we could have gotten at a 5 star hotel. We felt that this was a great value in a very expensive city. Yes, the beds were too hard for my taste and the pillows were a bit flat and hard (not the down I'm accustomed to).

The major San Zaccaria vaporetto stop, with lines that go anywhere you could possibly need, is right by the hotel. When I checked in and (I believe) Stefano handed me the keys, he said \"we give you a key to the building because we are like family here\" or something like that. And that is exactly how you feel at the wonderful Ca dei Dogi. The hotel may be in an old palace, but everything inside has been redone and is new and modern. Namely, the staircases are not nearly as steep or narrow as I was expecting (2 rooms are up one flight of stairs, another 2 rooms are up 2 flights of stairs, and then up from there). I had the single room, room 302, up two flights of stairs, for 4 nights from Aug 29 to Sept 2. As Stefano opened the door to my room, he said \"it's small but has everything you need\" Well he was right, it is VERY small, but it did have everything I needed and I was never once bothered by the size. If having big hotel rooms is important to you, this would not be the hotel to stay in (though I did peek into a couple of the double rooms and they were bigger, but still not huge). Very comfortable bed, excellent air conditioning, a small LCD TV with lots of stations (including CNN and BBC), a small but very clean modern bathroom with plenty of nice big fluffy towels, a decent-sized shower with 2 shower heads, and a bidet. Everything seemed relatively new in the entire hotel and everything was immaculately clean. There was also a nice little safe and fridge/minibar in the room and a little closet with plenty of hangers, and an extra pillow and blanket. The hotel also has a lovely little terrace on the top where you can have an evening drink and listen to the sounds from nearby San Marco. However, the hotel is impeccably quiet at night as it faces onto a little courtyard and the back of the Doge's Palace. Breakfast was OK, served from 8-10:15 in the morning. A very kind young man (who I presume is a waiter in the hotel's restaurant) was there every day, offering coffee (american style), espresso, and handmade cappuccinos, which I quite enjoyed. There were prepackaged hard little cracker/toast/biscuit things on the table and various flavors of yogurt, and he brought out fruit-filled croissants and some kind of delicious red orange drink. Some days I got offered an omelette, but not all. Perhaps the man who cooks it comes in later as 2 days I had breakfast around 8am and the other 2 days (when I was offered the omelette) after 9am. Anyway, it was adequate if not wonderful. The staff at the hotel is great. In addition to the man taking care of breakfast (whose name I unfortunately never caught), Susanna went above and beyond. The day before I was to leave, she asked me at breakfast if everything was OK for my departure the following day. I told her I had a train booked leaving from Mestre and she had me log into my email from the front desk so that she could try to change it - she said she would be too worried about me not making it to the right train in time and she wanted me to take a train leaving from the Venice S.L. station. Anyway, she was unable to change it but she printed out the schedules and my email with the train numbers for me, and I couldn't have thanked her enough. What service. Besides the average breakfast, I can only think of 2 other minor complaints. There's no internet access for guests, which would have been nice. But as I said, this is minor. The only other complaint is that one of the young men working in the restaurant essentially tried to ask me out multiple times to the point where it got obnoxious. When I arrived, Stefano had him bring my suitcase up the 2 flights of stairs and it was difficult to get him to leave my room. Two days later he stopped me on the staircase and it was difficult to get him to understand that my answer was no. And he was there all the time - early in the morning taking out trash and cleaning outside the hotel, later at night working at the restaurant, so avoiding him was difficult. I don't think he meant any harm but as this was one of my first experiences upon my arrival to Venice and the Ca dei Dogi, it was a bit frustrating. But it did not ruin my image of the hotel or the wonderful city of Venice, I just write this as a heads up to other females, especially those of us traveling alone. All in all, for the location, price, quality of accommodation and friendliness of the service, I doubt you can beat the Ca dei Dogi in Venice.
