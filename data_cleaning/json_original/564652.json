I am a regular guest at establishments such as The W, Renaissance, Kimpton, and Westin (or most Starwood Hotels). After researching hotels and prices in the Phoenix area for a business trip, I kept going back to this Radisson property. I was reluctant because the price seemed too reasonable for the amenities offered, and for the excellent reviews....too good to be true, maybe? I took the chance, and booked my stay, and am so pleased that I did. The rooms, as well as the entire property were very, very clean. It is apparent that this is important to them. Gabina was a sweetheart, and payed attention to the \"Do not disturb\" sign.They were also efficient in their communication to housekeeping as to my late check out. Not a difficult thing, but doesn't always happen that way at other hotels. Nicole and Jenny at the front desk were very courteous, and went above and beyond being helpful and were very efficient. They are an asset to this hotel, and I hope that they are recognized for their efforts. I liked the fact that there was a restaurant on site, as well as a bar area. The food is very reasonably priced, but not the drinks....a bit over priced. Room service was fast, and the food was hot and tasty. Complimentary internet throughout the hotel, as well as a complimentary business center that provides four or five computers for guests were an added value, if you didn't travel with a laptop, etc. The 24 HR airport shuttle service is also great. They run a timely, efficient operation, and the driver was a gentleman. I feel bad that I do not remember his name....

I didn't swim but saw several people using the outdoor pool. My room was very clean and I really liked the king bed. My neighbors showed up late both evenings I was there and were rather loud and kept the tv on all evening, some people's lack of common courtesy amazes me. The airport shuttle 'only' started at 5 am so I had to get up and drop off my associate with our rental vs. sleeping in for a couple of hours before my flight, a little hassle.

You can decrease or increase firmness for a full 5 seconds without changing the number at all but you can definitely feel the difference. Some people might like the bed but it is not the top of the line bed; it feels a bit like sleeping on an air mattress.

We came upon the Radisson Hotel. We went to the website and was very pleased at what we saw. The selling point was the Sleep Number Bed. Once we arrived (in the 1st room) I was looking for the remote to the bed and come to find out it wasn't a room with the Sleep Number Bed. Then I called front desk to find out if any rooms were available with the Sleep Number Bed and she was more than happy to accommodate me. She said all I had to do was come back to the front desk to get the Key to the room. The new room was two doors down from the previous. The room was very clean and the decor was eye pleasing. The computer chair at the desk was so comfortable I wanted to take it home LOL. The bathroom was VERY clean not a single strand of hair was on the floor and mirror was spotless. The 2nd day of my stay I had my jacket dry cleaned so I dropped it off at 8 and was informed that my jacket would be ready around 6pm. I had planned on leaving the room at 6:30 but couldn't and I didnt receive my jacket until 7! Another thing was that the water from the bathroom sink was too hot. Before we left to go out on the town we ask the front desk clerks what events was going on for the night and all pitched in with events which was very helpful. They even informed us about the forms of transportation offered in the area. My final morning we had breakfast at the buffet and we were greeted with a smile by the hostess. Breakfast was very good but the pancakes were hard so I opted for the Waffles which was self served (waffle iron on the buffet line). They had a great selection of breakfast items and drinks available. One thing I really liked was the express check-out. When I woke up on my last morning, my receipt was slid under the door. I didn't have to go to the desk to check-out but if I had a discrepancy or anything then that would be the only reason to go there.

My observations: 1. SHUTTLE: If you stay at the Radisson near the airport and call for a shuttle, MAKE SURE you tell the driver you are staying at the Radisson Airport North. There are two Radisson hotels near the airport, and the driver did not ask us about which hotel we were registered--we had no idea there were two of them! When the shuttle arrived (after two calls), he took us to the WRONG Radisson hotel. I would have normally just stayed at the hotel where we were taken, but since I booked a special deal, I was obligated to stay at Radisson Airport North. The driver then did not want to drive us to the correct hotel. After 45 minutes of waiting at the\"other\" Radisson, his manager convinced him to take us to the Airport North. 2. SHUTTLE PART 2: There is no 24 hour free shuttle at this hotel. They begin the shuttle service at 5 am, so if you have a 6 am flight you better plan on spending $15 for a 3 mile taxi ride. 3. CUSTOMER SERVICE: The second time I stayed here the front desk clerk was outside smoking a cigarette. After 5 minutes of puffing away he showed up and checked us in. While I don't have a degree in Hotel Management, I thought this was unacceptable---especially since he was in full view of the front desk from his smoking area outside. 3. ROOMS: Clean and comfortable. The rooms come with a \"Sleep Number\" bed so you can adjust the bed to your liking. 4. BREAKFAST BUFFET/RESTAURANT/LOUNGE: It wasn't free, but the breakfast buffet had a good selection of hot and cold food. Service in the restaurant (both dinner and breakfast) was good. The lounge also had good, attentive staff. While the rooms were comfortable and I genuinely liked the restaurant and its staff, those components don't make up for waiting 45 minutes for a shuttle driver to take us to the correct hotel or a front desk clerk who attaches more importance to his cigarette than his job.

The shower head on the hose was so difficult to turn on and to figure out how to turn on that we had to call the maintenance person -- who couldn't figure out how to turn it on, either. Finally, my husband figured it out -- accidentally. The shower curtain wasn't long or wide enough to contain the water and so the floor got flooded.

I read that some got it for $50, so next time I may bid lower. Since I was flying out the next morning this place was the best. The shuttle was fast and friendly. So was check in (mine was fast: no line and there were 2 employees at the desk). I was very impressed with the rooms. They were clean with nice bathrooms and that sleep number bed is a dream. There was also free wi-fi which is very impressive for any hotel not to tack on an additional charge. Since I was tired, I did the quick walk to the Chinese cultural center and had dinner at the bar at the Golden Buddha. This is not your typical Chinese restaurant: the clams in spicy garlic sauce were amazing! So was the crispy quail appetizer. Also, the bartender (I think his name was Patrick) was very friendly and made my evening a pleasure (especially having to dine alone!).

They look ok from a distance but when you get up close they are brimming with problems. This was a pleasant exception. This is a very nice three star hotel. All of the staff I encountered was friendly and helpful. The room was almost perfectly clean (and I think there is no better complement for a hotel than that) The forward Hilton-like space maximizing design of the room was nice as well. The sleep number bed was great. The shuttle to the airport takes eight minutes (I timed it) One other great thing about this place is the proximity to this Asian cultural center food area/office complex two blocks north of the hotel. It is hard to see from the road. When you get past the Chinese garden and walk in the arches you discover a whole asian mall full of Chinese restaraunts and a vietnamese superstore. The only problems I could see would have to be the lack of a business center. That is pretty inexcusable for an \"airport\" hotel. Especially since they can make it pay for itself if they want to. Another issue might be the staffing at the counters. They were nice, but they really needed a couple of extra people when I was there. The line was too long, but I was only there one night, might have been a fluke. All in all a great place. I would gladly stay there again.", "Date": "March 1, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Albuquerque, NM", "Title": "\u201cI'd go back\u201d", "Author": "NMtravelertoo", "ReviewID": "UR6650670", "Content": "A beautiful hotel, inside and out.

Our flight landed at 10:30pm and instead of driving to our resort in Scottsdale we opted to stay close to the airport for some rest. We got the hotel for $50 on price line so I can't complain too much, but it was just an average \"hotel\" stay with the general houskeeping/front desk issues. The room was not a sleep number bed which we were told it would be, it overlooked the airport and massive air conditioning units on the roof (not a big deal, we were only there to sleep) and the room was pretty unkept for being a \"clean room\" the bottled water they provide was half empty and never replaced, the bathroom floor still had hair and misc paper in corners, bathtub needed a scrub, the coffeemaker still dirty from last guest and the bed, although made, seemed oddly not fresh, as if they never changed the sheets....kinda skeevy but I chalked it up and went to bed. When we checked in, everything was closed and we were starving (by the way we found it odd for the bar to be closed at 11pm on saturday night in a large city like this), so we ordered take out at a nearby italian place who delivered to our room in about 45 minutes. As previous guests mentioned, the AC units are SO LOUD. You can't even hear yourself think when it is going, but the room was too warm not to have it on so we had to put pillows over our heads to sleep. The airplane wasn't even that noisy...it was terrible. I would say that this hotel has been way over rated here on tripadvisor and that it is a great hotel if you can get it for $50 a night on priceline, but if you paid regular rack rate at $149 it isn't worth it.
