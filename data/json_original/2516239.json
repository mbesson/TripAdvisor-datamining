One night isn't really enough time to properly judge a place and I don't think this is intended to be a business travelers hotel. But for what its worth my comments are as follows: The location is convenient, right at one end of the main street and an easy walk to all of the restaurants and bars in town. The location is a bit unusual, as indicated by other reviewers. The location has the benefit of being quiet and the same complex conveniently includes a nice restaurant (Tra Vigne) and a winery worth visiting (Merryvale). However, it almost appears to be a re-purposed office park. Nothing wrong with that, just a bit unusual. The public spaces are nice if a bit spare, just as you see them on the website. My room and bathroom were very large and bright, which is a nice change from many places these days. The room definitely had some nice touches: a fireplace, french doors that opened up on to a (small) balcony and huge cathedral ceilings which really provide a nice feeling of space and light. The bathroom was large, bright and very clean. But somehow it just didn't quite seem in place for an upscale hotel - it felt like a nice guest bathroom at someones house - not really a luxury hotel bathroom. My bed was very comfortable and I slept well. The room and all of the hotel that I saw are very clean and well maintained. The continental breakfast was ok. Not the best and not the worst - just the typical assortment of pastries, cereals, yogurt, etc. Hotel staff were all very good - friendly and helpful.

The bathroom was ok---nothing to write home about, but serviceable. It had a skylight, which is nice. There was a refrigerator-mini bar. There is a very small balcony overlooking another nearby building and a courtyard, and beyond you can see cars on the highway constantly and trains going by occasionally about 150 ft away The room cleaners had a lot of used towels and other materials in the hallway--I expect a neater cart than that. The TV was ok, but on the small side, and not flat screen. Another good thing was the free breakfast. This was acutally pretty good, with cereal, pastries, fruit, coffee, and orange juice.

Tra Vigne is a local restaurant (actually two restaurants - one is a pizzeria and the other is a very good regular restaurant) within about 30 seconds walking distance. One winery is right there as well, although the others in the area are about half a mile away. Definitely won't hurt for wineries within a few mile range and almost all are open 10-6 and don't require any appointment so don't worry about that. Yountville is a quaint town about 10 minutes away, worth walking around in on a nice night to just relax. Would definitely stay again and do recommend it to others.", "Date": "August 23, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cEnjoyable\u201d", "Author": "Nikon70", "ReviewID": "UR5440541", "Content": "We stayed at the Inn for 3 nights and really enjoyed our stay.

I particularly liked the fitness & spa facilities. Unfortunately I have not stayed at any other hotels in Napa & do not have anything to compare it to but overall we really enjoyed it. The room was quite large with a very lovely fireplace and a balcony that faced the main street. The location is very convenient to the wineries that we like (Cakebread is one of our favorites!) & it is in walking distance to some good restaurants in town. This year (March 2006) I think we will try the Calistoga resort & will compare. Be advised, main things I look for are: 1. NICE fitness facilities (preferably with personal trainers & yoga classes on site) 2. cozy romantic rooms with fireplaces 3. classy facility with good friendly service and ... complimentary breakfast is always a plus too when on vacation!", "Date": "February 27, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Highlands Ranch, CO", "Title": "\u201cgreat location\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3484649", "Content": "We did not have advance reservations, but found the suite very nice and the location excellent for the local restaurants and wineries.

I have to admit though, I was a bit nervous staying somewhere that had no reviews written about it... but I went ahead and booked it anyway. You would never know that this hotel even exists because it is doesn't really look like a hotel. It is quite small and is hidden (behind tons of beautiful Wisteria) even though it is just off the main street in St. Helena. We found the staff to be very friendly. The room was generous in size, nicely decorated, had a fireplace, comfortable bedding and bed. We chose a room facing the parking lot, which was slightly less expensive, but it didn't really matter in the end. The other side of the hotel looks out into a sort of courtyard/restaurant area. There was a tiny balcony looking out, but really too small to use. The continental breakfast was fairly typical, and we also dined in the Tra Vigne Pizzeria (attached to the hotel) which was great for us since we travelled with our young daughter. St. Helena was a quaint town and the hotel is in walking distance to restaurants, shopping, wine tasting, etc. I did go to the health spa (which is literally opposite the front door), which was quite small and nothing to rave about. Also, my locker had a problem and I had to go get someone to open it which was annoying, but it was nice to have the option to use their basic facilities that were included in our room rate. Our room package also came with a bottle of wine. Overall, I would definitely recommend staying here. It was our first time to the Napa Valley so I can't compare it to anywhere else there, but for a convenient location, smaller and a less tourist-y choice, the Inn at Southbridge would be a great place to stay.", "Date": "May 8, 2005"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Southbridge Napa Valley", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g33000-d111940-Reviews-Southbridge_Napa_Valley-St_Helena_Napa_Valley_California.html", "Price": "$295 - $549*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">1020 Main St.</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">St. Helena</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">CA</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">94574</span></span> (Formerly Inn at Southbridge)</span></span></address>", "HotelID": "2516239", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/fc/52/fc52439d9627123578eee94c3ddf93e46large.jpg"}}
