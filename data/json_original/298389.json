{"Reviews": [{"Content": "A Descent Into Hell (but maybe you're into that) Stayed at the Astoria the week before and after New Year's only because everything else was booked. The staff was nice enough, especially Ron, a gentleman from Finland who also sings opera professionally. They got me one of their more decent rooms (there aren't many). View of an alley and rooftop but the bed was okay and the TV big. Problems started when bed bugs began feasting on me the first night. The staff gave me insecticide to use and then an exterminator solved the problem a few days later. A bigger issue at the Astoria is that it's infested with bigger bugs, the two-legged kind. The Astoria is what we in the U.S. would call a hooker hotel, only in no worries Australia, it's business as usual. There are a lot of street walkers that operate out of the Astoria and most of them are Ice Queens, as in they shoot up with Ice AKA meth-amphedemine in the U.S. (each Astoria room has a needle disposal bucket). I never really felt threatened by these ladies but some of the blokes (dealers?) wandering about the halls were a little scary. So if you're into a different kind of hotel experience, go for it.", "Date": "May 24, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR168908299", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Mischa3"}, {"Content": "Wer hier bucht ist selber schuld!   showReview(6713247, 'full');", "Date": "Jan 29, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR149884377", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Alex24"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g255060-d298389-r7687382-Astoria_Hotel-Sydney_New_South_Wales.html", "HotelID": "298389", "Price": "$67"}}
