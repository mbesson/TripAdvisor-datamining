However, one of my chaperones had a room that had been smoked in. Due to the hot weather, opening the windows and airing the room was not possible. We requested a new room as our stay was three nights, but were not accommodated. Additionally, the pool was not open due to what the staff called \"technical problems\" and was no one worked on it for the 4 days we were there.

It was the first time we were to use the bus, and my participants did not know that they should have waived down the driver. We immediately notified the front desk that the bus had left us, and asked that he turn around and pick us up, as we were there at the designated departure time. This did not happen. They did run an extra run for us we believe because we waited only an extra hour, not an hour and a half as was scheduled. We knew from then on to be aggressive and get on the bus immediately. The breakfasts were good and by the end of the four day stay, the front desk became more friendly. The manager seemed to not care about our comfort during our stay, but the desk help was more helpful and friendly.

Located on Via Aurelia, it is some way out of the city and therefore for the budding Roman explorer, is a little out of town. It is set on a hill overlooking the via Aurelia which is simply a very busy road/artery into central Rome. The view from the front rooms in uninspiring (the busy road) and from the rear just dull. On a good day it is a 20 minute road journey. At busy times a good deal longer. The hotel itself has a very tired feel. The pool is dirty and needs some care.The decor on the outside needs frshening up. Inside the lobby/reception and rooms are functional if not luxurious. In my room it was clean, tidy and worked OK. Hot water and pressure are good. The staff like any hotel vary in their Customer-service soft skills but being Rome this is a recurring theme and I don't think you can adeversely score it on this point. The restaurant is adequate but my advice is to take a cab ride and find somewhere typically Roman. The food in the hotel is not particulalry good and is a little over-priced. In summary, the hotel lacks some decent investment. It could be much better, but to be honest is a poor relation in terms of appeal compared to the Holiday Inn (which is 200 yards away) if this area and price point are what you want. But really, get further into Rome in a smaller, more intimate Hotel and let the city compensate you for the standard of Rome hotels in General. On a point to business users.

When the shuttle service used to be free, it wasn\u2019t much of a bother but since a fee is charged nowadays, this alone is a factor not to recommend the hotel. Although the rooms are fairly large compared to most hotel rooms in Rome, they were poorly maintained. The carpet had multiple unidentifiable stains and was dusty. Do not go barefoot in the room. The bathroom needs to be re-tiled and the faucets have to be re-fitted. There were stains in the hallway carpet and mildew in some areas. The pool service is erratic depending on the season. This one saving grace of the hotel is closed for part of the year. Breakfast is standard but you would be much happier buying food from any of the food purveyors in the city. Generic bread and yogurt do nothing for the spirit. Thankfully my encounters with hotel staff were all pleasant. Perhaps because the hotel still continues to be patronized by most tour companies, the management has become complacent in terms of housekeeping.

I found the staff to be quite friendly and one gentleman went out of his way to call a restaurant for us and get walking directions, menu sampler, and a reservation. He inquired about our dining experience when we returned and because we enjoyed it so much (Argentinian steak house called \"Buaries\", like Buenos Aries) he took his family the next night and too raved about it too.

We lost power twice in our room. Our AC worked but some family traveling with us didn't have working AC. The second to last day a part of our bathroom door fell off. Various places within the room had paint falling off. The fixtures were very, very old. There wasn't a dresser, not even drawers in the night stands. The mattress was far past it's lifespan, you could feel every spring coil. The shuttle was mentioned as every half hour, really its hour, and there are a few large gaps during the day when it doesn't run. It typically takes 30m to get into the city. The pool was closed for half our stay, for the other half it closed at 7:00 PM. What use is a pool that closes so early? The only reason we stayed at this hotel was because we wanted the pool as a place to cool off after a long hot day in the city. I've never been to a hotel with a pool that closed at 7. Then, half way through our trip they started doing exterior work on the hotel and completely shut down all pools & balconies, including in-room balconies. I couldn't imagine why, the work was at ground level, but whatever. Hotel staff said it'd be closed for a long time. They'd also annoyingly get pushy about where resort guests could go for meals. The bar was ridiculously overpriced with $6 cokes (I'm applying the $ to euro exchange rate). The restaurants were of course overpriced as most things in Rome, but service was good there atleast. Desk service was good as well. There was pay wifi & a small pay computer/internet cafe available. $10 euros for an hour. When so many US hotels, even cheap ones that go for less than $50 a night, offer it for free, having to pay for it is somewhat insulting. There was no fitness center. The walls were unbearably thin. You could hear ever word said in the rooms next door. The condition of the resort could best be typified by their interactive TV services. If you turn on the TV you'll watch an intro alluding to many different services. But when you go through the menus to learn more 90% it all just says \"under construction.\" I would not stay here again, nor recommend it to others.

The hotel is on the outskirts of Rome and is used extensively by coach tours. Luckily they are separated for meals, so no queueing with them all at breakfast! On our first night the hotel was overrun with noisy German kids, but mostly coaches of Japanese and Greek adults after this. If the hotel did not have the pool and the shuttle coach service there would be little to recommend it for. The decor is in need of updating and the staff can appear aloof and maybe unfriendly, but I got the feeling that this is so in Rome, as somewhat similar in the city centre. With the coach service and the pool though, the hotel definitley becomes recommended. The coach service is reliable and comfortable. The driver who looked like de Niro kept us amused with his bad tempered attitude to all other drivers, but he always got us there safely, though no quicker than the other drivers who were far more relaxed! The pool is superb, large, clean, with a lifeguard and supplied towels, much better that the Holiday Inn next door has. There are not too many sunbeds though as most guests are sightseeing I never found that they were all in use. With two teenage children it was great to take the first coach into Rome at 8.15 to sightsee, come back on the noon or 3pm coach and then relax at the pool in the afternoon. We ate once at the outside barbeque restaurant and, though surprised that this was the only choice of restaurant, the grilled meat and the buffet was superb and good value. Breakfast was good, with the expected continental choice plus scrambled eggs, bacon and sausages. Good selection of fruit that they do not mind you taking out of the restaurant. One criticism is that it is not possible to order a sandwich or such simple snack at the poolside tables during the day, you can only have a meal (pasta, lasagne etc). There is though, a large supermarket in front of the hotel, plus a macdonalds and a good baguette shop witin the Agip petrol station next door. (Note: turn left from reception, past the coach parking and walk past the sliding metal gates to reach the safe Holiday Inn road that joins the highway by the Agip garage, its safer than walking from the supermarket).

The pool looked lovely, but it was still closed during the begining of June (... it was about 27 deg. cel. outside). We paid about $200 per night for a room. And it worth it ! (especially if my wife said that it met her standerds). Overall I would say this is a very recomanded hotel, if you mange to accept the use of a shuttel to reach the center of Rome, and the cost of a taxi from the airport to the MIDAS (about 30 - 40 Euro, for about 30 min drive). If you rent a car, it wouldn't be an issue for you.", "Date": "June 5, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "northeast england", "Title": "\u201cWhat? No pool open\u201d", "Author": "Mustgo", "ReviewID": "UR3528574", "Content": "Arrived after midnight on Tuesday 31 May 2005. Taxi from Ciampino airport cost 49 euros. I thought it would be easy to barter but there were few unbooked taxis. Add these costs onto your seemingly cheap flights. Hotel reception desk staff were all efficient and pleasant. The comfortable double room on the fourth floor, overlooking the empty swimming pool, was very clean though the bath looked cracked, it was in fact fine. The air conditioning was an advantage as Rome temperatures are too uncomfortable not to have. The bed was huge and because the hotel was set back from a busy road, the noise was minimal, though Rome ambulances make such a racket that no hotel anywhere could hide their sirens. We gave up trying to work out how to use the credit card pass safe but we would have asked if we really wanted to. There was a keyboard for internet access facility in the room. The dining room was quiet. The breakfast included cereals, fruits, yoghurts, and the usual continental pastries though none looked exciting. The 'English' breakfast area had a heated covered tray with small tasty sausuages, scrambled egg, bacon and a toast making machine. Replacing the lid kept the contents warm enough. No frills just basic. Each evening we returned at midnight after catching the last shuttle, to find only a few customers in the bar, however the pianist still played when there was no one there. We sat outside on the veranda wondering how many people were staying here. Coaches parked up indicated that there were more than 20 in the hotel, yet in our entire stay we never saw more than that amount. By finding this website for the first time, the day before I travelled, I'd read a review that the swimming pool was not open. The pool was the factor for booking. It should be opened in another week but the reception desk staff was vague on the actual date. The shuttle bus is a must. The hotel is situated above two busy roads and it wasn't safe to go for a walk. There is a supermarket at the foot of the hotel but looked impossible to access without transport. Make sure you have a timetable of the punctual clean efficient shuttle coachbus as we forgot to take ours on the last day and had to get a taxi back from the pick up point Piazza Cavour at 1pm as the shuttle has a three hour break in the afternoon. We shared a taxi back to the Jolly Midas with another couple who hadn't read their timetable either. However it cost only 13 euros and they insisted on paying. Reading the tariff charges displayed in the back of the taxi , we discovered it is like England, much more expensive on an evening or once you are outside the city walls the price increases. If you have luggage there is a fee per piece. Next time, because there will most definitely be a return to Rome, I will take recommendation from Travel Advisors members reports and stay where its possible to return easily to our hotel for a wash and change before going out for the evening. I recommend a stay in the Jolly Midas if you want a comfortable, quiet hotel with a relaxed ambience and with a swimming pool...but check its open. Don't stay if you hate being dependant on buses or you want a party atmosphere.

Generally, we had a good stay in this hotel. We found the breakfasts very good and plenty of choice, the piano bar was very relaxing and Vincenzo was the perfect barman bringing little bowls of snacks to our table to help the drinks go down. The reception staff were very helpful, even when one member of our party had repeated problems with the door lock. The reliable shuttle bus ran from 8.15 in the morning 'til 11.30 at night. If you missed the bus it was still only about 10 euros for the five of us to come back in a taxi. We'd booked this hotel because it had a beautiful swimming pool and had planned to spend the last day chilling out round the pool before flying home on the evening. Unfortunately, we hadn't been told when booking the hotel (only a couple of weeks before we travelled) that the pool was drained and being re-landscaped. This was the only disappointing note in a very nice stay. We would certainly consider staying at this hotel again.", "Date": "May 16, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ireland", "Title": "\u201cJolly...' good '\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3353740", "Content": "we stayed at the jolly hotel midas in march 2005 .Our stay there could not have been more pleasant.we were a party of three people and had two rooms which were very pleasant and clean although if i could mention that the decor needs updating a little tired perhaps....dont like to moan but I am sure you like these matters brought to your attention.The reception staff were very friendly and helpful also the courtesy hotel bus was excellent and only took about 15 to 20 minutes into city centre, perhaps this would be longer in the busier summer months but we were very pleased it was available and reliable .I would like to mention the bar service we received in the piano bar at evening time,the barman was so lovely to us bringing nuts and crisps with drink orders and served toasted sandwiches until late in the evening.we were very impressed with the manner we were treated,he wass a real professional he really seemed to enjoy his job,a great asset to the hotel.we enjoyed our evening meals with equally pleasant staff and were able to have steak and chips no problem just like at home [Ireland] if you have a preferance for well done learn the italian as it will be served quite rare.We would love to be going back there right now and we hope to get the chance again next year and if we could mention the lovely ladies who look after the rooms top marks for friendliness and cleanliness .Well worth a visit", "Date": "April 12, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco", "Title": "\u201cButterfly\u201d", "Author": "Butterfly", "ReviewID": "UR3101593", "Content": "My husband and I plus 2 other of our friends stayed in Jolly Midas in Rome and were very pleased.
