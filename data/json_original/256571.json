There are no lifts at this hotel, and we had to walk up 3 flights of stairs to get to our room, on the top floor. We both thought that the images online of this hotel were a little out of date, as our room was not as crisp as the photos looked. Some quick fixes have obviously been made over time and it shows. Our room (302) was quite large, and our bathroom was a good size. We found that the room was surprisingly quiet of a nighttime even though the nightclub downstairs was open and the hotel is located on a major road which was really busy. The curtains made the room dark for the morning. The location of the hotel is supreme if you are interested in heading out for dinner, a few drinks or seeing the nightlife (abiet the nightlife is pretty trashy - but great for people watching).

The air conditioning sort of worked and the bathroon was unclean and moldy. A cup of tea would have been nice, excpet there was nowhere to plug the kettle in, except if it was sat on the floor to boil. SO I went back to the desk to ask for another room, but the kid had disappeared and after waiting 15 mins for someone to materialise, I was told that it was the best room in the category I booked and I could pay a $50 supplement to upgrade but he was staying in that room and it would have to be serviced and I would have a two hour wait. I declined the offer and decided to leave. Never ever again. It says \"boutique style\" accommodation on Wotif, but I am puzzled how that translates to dirty, dingy and dodgy.

I guess minimalist interior design has now given forth to nihilist design. Four stark white walls, a bed and one straight back chair in the corner. Australian moderne? I can dig it , but why even bother with the extravagance of a chair? Oh yeah, \"luxury\". \"Hip, ambient, intimate\". Wow. If only those euphemisms could fumigate that windowless cell. I would guess the first floor rooms (like mine) were largely rented by the hour since I can't imagine much sleeping gets done (on the weekend anyway) given the \"ambient intimacy\" of the Reggaeton slicing through the paper thin walls from the club on the opposite side from Petit Cremer. It sounded like fun, more than what was happening in \" my hotel room at the end of the world\" where I lay wondering how effective I was going to be at work the next day. But hey, I could have asked to be moved to another unsoundproofed room. The phone didn't work. Air-conditioner inoperative. The bathroom double-doors were sadly unaligned so could not close. The shower looked grotty and unscrubbed. Each day, small bags of trash were left decorating the hallway (more minimalist design no doubt). Cable reception for that hanging tv monitor (see AliBe103's fotos) that looked like it was salvaged from the Mir space station was spotty at best.

I came back about 10.30 to and asked if I could leave my small bag until 2.00 pm and was told there was a $10.00 service charge after 12.00 pm - a bit rich I thought for 2 hours... - I paid the money and saw the $ 10.00 disappear into the receptionists wallet and no receipt was given - so the holding of baggage is a nice little money earner for the staff I would think. All in all, the hotel served it's purpose for me - I was invited to dinner close by and it was convenient for this - but would I stay again, well I am not sure, but certainally not if something better came along - the experience was depressing due to lack of care and service by the staff.

I booked it through lastminute so I wasn't sure what to expect. I really couldn't fault the place, I was given one of the rooms on the top floor with a balcony, I'm not sure what the other rooms where like but I really liked mine. Bearing in mind I was staying here on my own I felt totally safe all the time, I liked the neighbourhood (OK Kings Cross is near by but you can avoid that)and I was often out when it was dark.

It was cleaned everyday, with fresh towels and I thought the shower was great. The staff could be a bit cocky, but generally I found them very helpful, the only negative issues were the tea and coffee making facilities, the rubbish hair dryer and I couldn't work out the air con. Also, I arrived at 8am after a 23hour flight and they wouldn't let me have my room until 2pm but after badgering them they gave it to me sooner.

I liked the hotel that much that I booked for another 4 days on my return from sailing! A few Sydney tips: Don't catch the Sydney Explorer - it's alot more interesting to do it on foot as you'll see alot more. Do catch the Bondi Explorer - get off at Watson's Bay for fish and chips, but watch the seagulls as they attack you! Get back on and hop off at Bondi Beach and do the coastal walk down to Coogee - its really beautiful. During your first day go up the Centrepoint Tower to get your bearings. Also, make a trip over to Balmain, hardly any tourists go there and it's full of gorgeous houses, boutiques and coffee shops, there's also a great view of Sydney.

I read the previous comments after booking the hotel, and thought, oh ***, I have made a mistake. Got there, and after one night, realized I am either just easy or see things from a different angle. I had a junior room. It was small, with no view, but not as small as rooms I have paid twice the price for in Paris and San Francisco. The high ceilings gave it more volume too. The bed was very comfy (I'm 6'2\") and I liked the \"less is more\" look of the place. It was a very busy weekend in Sydney, with football finals and all, so there was no vacancy for my 3rd night, and I went across town to stay elsewhere. However, I returned for 3 more nights to a different room. This one had a different layout, a window that opened in the bathroom, and a slightly larger shower, a glass desk, and a larger bed. Still very comfy, a little noisier, but not so that I couldn't sleep well. On the service side, the guys who worked there were very accomodating. I wanted ice, typical American that I am, and had a bucket of ice delivered to my room within 10 minutes. My partner called on my birthday, I was out, and one of the guys quickly made a birthday card with a sketch of the Sydney Harbor Bridge and the Opera House and my birthday message on it, and left it on the desk for me. I got great suggestions on good places to eat and drink and sight-see. All were done with kindness, and a casual earnestness, rather than the standard corporate line and painted on smile that I usually encounter in the hospitality industry. While the entry hall/front desk were one and the same, I thought it a clever use of a small amount of space. Location of the hotel is great--close to many bars, cafe's, pubs, stores, etc., but far enough away for some quiet. I have paid more money for blah, characterless hotels, with staff who didn't seem to care that I was spending my hard earned dollars to stay at their place of business, and this place was definitely not one of them. I would definitely recommend L'otel to my freinds and will stay again on my next time in Sydney.", "Date": "October 2, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cdon't be fooled by the website!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2498207", "Content": "We stayed at L'Otel for (luckily) only one night in July, 2004.

The front desk is in a corridor and after checking-in, guests are invited to carry there bags up a series of dark stairwells to the room.
