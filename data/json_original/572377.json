It is very outdate and extremely dirty. The walls has visible dirt lines and cracks on them near the beds. There were over flowing dumpsters out front and garbage rolling around in the streets surrounding the hotel. The rooms looked nothing the pictures posted on the website. We were so unhappy here that we forfited the \"free breakfast\" and offers for cappuccino on our way out because we could not wait to leave. It was a 20 Euro ride to the airport via hotel shuttle service. Very disappointing!", "Date": "July 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, California", "Title": "\u201cDon't ruin your vacation\u201d", "Author": "HeidiinItaly", "ReviewID": "UR71816914", "Content": "I travel a lot in Italy and understand Americans can be more demanding than Europeans. My demands are more within the European range. Arriving at the Bellavista, I expected little more than the airport hotel we'd have otherwise gotten. However I had requested an ocean view room but was told no such request was on file. Instead we were shown a cramped room on the ground floor at the back with a broken AC. I asked to change but that was all that was available there or anywhere else in walking distance. My complaints regarding the disgusting conditions below were met with a shrug. In the room the floors were weirdly sticky. There was used chewing gum ground into the bedspread with hair stuck in it. The toilet seat was cracked. There was mold growing in the bathroom cup holder and soap dispenser which ran out of soap mid-shower attesting to how often they bother refilling it. The shower door repeatedly popped out of the cheap frame allowing water to spray into the bathroom. The halls look like they were decorated in 1983 and have the scuffs and stains to attest to the last renovation. Our room's door numbers had fallen off and were sort of penciled in. We heard bangs from doors and other hall traffic throughout the night. It's definitely a hotel that has spared every expense when it comes to service. They have an attitude of \"we are near the beach so we don't have to try.\" Save yourself the heartbreak and stay at the Airport Hilton.", "Date": "July 21, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Riga", "Title": "\u201cDo not have high expectations about this hotel\u201d", "Author": "MSJV", "ReviewID": "UR47171560", "Content": "Let's describe it in simple way; good points and bad points. Good points: nice view from the balcony towards the sea, large terrace (we were given the best room, i guess with the largest terrace style balcony with direct sea view:-), not far from main railway station to Rome, shops and places to eat Bad points: (where do i begin?:-) hot water wasn't hot enough for October, had to run the water and wait for a while until it warmed up a little. Shower cubicle gets blocked immediately, so you stand in cold water and have a slightly warmer shower. Afterwards you get cold. Air conditioning - we could not get it work for warm air, but luckily the weather was not too cold, so we did not use it. Wall sockets - they are old, we could not use the charger for our laptop. Breakfast was the same everyday, not much choice and rather poor. There is a jacuzzi on the top terrace, but to use sauna you have to pay additional charge 8 EUR per person.", "Date": "October 18, 2009"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Bellavista", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187791-d572377-Reviews-Bellavista-Rome_Lazio.html", "Price": "$65 - $139*", "Address": "<div class=\"amenFloat\">", "HotelID": "572377", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/22/da/22da6ec618542db1f4b1007bb55ac2645large.jpg"}}
