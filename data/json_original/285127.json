Didn't have a pre reservation so after coming out of the station we looked left and right and went to this hotel. AS we were with a 4 year old son so we didn't want to waste time in looking for different accmodations. The hotel is located less than 2 mintes walk from the railway station to the left. Here is what to expect from this hotel. We stayed at the ground floor. The room was of a reasonable size and everything was spotless clean. The furniture was very good, polished and of a very - very good quality. The AC was working fine. The beds were very comfortable. Our hats off for the house-keeper as we didn't see a single particle of dust and stab on the walls and floor of the toilets and shower. Their breakfast was really poor and is not worth of mentioning. Pricewise it is not cheap and is towards the upper side of the reasonable category. Now here is the point; the old gentleman at the reception was just a feelingless soul. They give you such a feeling that one thinks that why one came to this hotel at the first place. We asked him to extend the check out time for one hour and his reply was '' Sorry!! No extension not even for the five minutes-want to have a room or not''. In the morning the breakfast staff was in a such a big rush that they closed everything and took the dishes and the other stuff 5 minutes before the actual closing time. Two australian girls happened to arrive for breakfast 2 minutes before the closing time. The rude answer was-''we are closed now'' Even to met the request of those girls for only a cup of tea was a big thing for the staff. At the time of checkout i requested a city map of Venice and the receptionist has a two long breaths because it was too much of a work for her to go inside the office room to fetch a map. I thanked her for the stay and she didn't even bother to say -BYE! Nothing wrong with the rooms, We had a very good sleep indeed. Nothing very much right with the staff that we got to know. I personally will try something different next time but won't mind if as a last choice i need to stay here again. We get off at Venice mestare because the conductor in the train has told us that santa monica is madly expensive. My tip for the fellow travelers is that accmodation in terms of price at Venice Santa monica is no less or more than the venice mestare.", "Date": "August 15, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney", "Title": "\u201cMiserable\u201d", "Author": "b/house", "ReviewID": "UR7976364", "Content": "Disasterous - Rude front desk.

The hotel is about 5 min walk from both the Eurobus bus stop (which will bring you from Treviso airport 45 mins away) and the Mestre Railway station. Mestre station takes you over to the island in about 10 mins. It was quite nice taking the train over the sea to reach Venice Island. The first 2 staff members we met were a bit sour faced to be honest. But we had no problems getting what we wanted; they don't speak much English either. The younger staff member was very helpful and friendly. The rooms were basic but very clean. TV only has CNN for English speakers. Breakfast is cereal, tea, coffee, orange, cheeses, ham and breads. Good enough for the price. It is bigger than it looks from the pictures on here and I would recommend it for those (like me) on a budget. It's very handy for the Airport and Venice Island. They even gave us breakfast earlier than usual because we had an early flight. I asked for the third floor in my booking request, but this wasn't done. I got a blunt \"FULL!\" when I asked about this. 3rd floor is supposed to be nicer and newer than the others. The shower in my room was tiny and was all-in with the toilet. I used my friends as it had a proper cubicle. No problem with noise from outside or inside.

However, I was very pleasantly surprised. Admittedly I was allocated a room on the third floor without even asking, but I thought the hotel was very nice - a nice mixture of old and new. I did have problems with the bathroom though, which extended beneath the eaves and was more than a little shocked when I realised that the head space above the bath/shower was no more than about 3'6\" (a bit of a problem when you stand 6'2\"!). I then discovered that they provided you with a plastic stool which you could put in the bath to sit on when showering, which worked out just fine. The location was very good though, being literally across the road from the station, where for 1 Euro you can take the train straight into Venice's Santa Lucia station in 8 minutes, with trains running every few minutes. Admittedly I visited in late November, so was able to keep my window closed at all times, meaning that I could block out the sound of the trains and fairly busy road between the hotel and the station.
