It's a very trendy, quirky and humorous hotel with a good sense of fun about it. For example - each room has its own decorative fish in it! Ours was a deep pink fish called Gilligan, who even had his own spotlight... The decor was very new and cool, and though it wasn't the quietest place to stay (the bar stayed noisy til after 11pm and there were roadworks outside our room), you couldn't beat it for sheer experience. The bar food is gourmet and delicious, and the chef catered really well towards my gluten and dairy free diet. The cocktails are heavenly - best I've had in a long time. The staff are friendly and fun; they'll just stop by your table to chat. And of course the pool (probably the warmest pool we swam in in Cal) has a big screen by it for their Wednesday night Dive-Ins and other events (we were there for a documentary). That's not everything I could say at all - for a relatively small hotel, it packs a lot in.

After reading most of the reviews on trip advisor being positive, I thought we were going to be staying at a really cool place. The restaurant food was ok. Movie night was cool. Our first night at the hotel was a Thursday night. After the movie we went back to our room. The room smelled good. But, there were many areas which could have used some attention. Dust along the edges of the walls, Nicks in the nice white furniture (would look better if touched up), Bathtub really gross and needing to be replaced (found out the next day that the drain could use attention too....standing water while showering), the caulking along the bathroom floor was so bad and the glaze on the tile was coming off. Under the sink the pipes are rusting out. Just needed much needed repair or replacement. There is a hairdryer, but it is very sticky with hairspray and tons of lint in the vent. The noise from the hotel is awful. The same retro music playing all night long. And a huge gap under the door to the room, which does not help at all! One last thing, the bedding is soiled. I woke up after the first night and was going to pull up the comforter, this is when I saw the stains! Gross!! So, I left a note asking to be replaced. The comforter must have been just turned around, as the stains were still there! I would not stay here again!

If you're looking for nightlife outside of their own restaurant on the weekends (we were disappointed to find that they close up at 10:30 SHARP weekdays) and don't have a car, not the best location. We booked through Tablet Hotels and the location said La Jolla - well, it's close to, but a 20 minute drive on the freeway. So not much to do at night in the area after 10:30. Also sad that the pool wasn't heated, even on two 28 degree days. Bike rentals were much appreciated - we biked to Ocean Beach (the closest beach) which took about 45 minutes (but the La Jolla beaches were much better).

Also, the entire staff was great, working as a team, without the \"attitude\" so common today at nice places. I worked all day writing while sitting at the bar (its' closed during the day), and accomplished my goals. The food is good (my wife is a \"foodie\") and we always eat there during our stays. Its just nice when your on the road, and get where your going, to not have to go somewhere else to have a drink, eat, or just chill-out. Its just a great place to be.There is a little road noise, due to its proximity to the street, and the bar crowd can create some noise if you turn in early.

My husband and I had booked a room at the pearl for 6 nights, but we had also just been in Vegas for 6 nights so needless to say we had a LOT of luggage etc. when we arrived at the pearl we were greeted by the smell of delicious food, good music, friendly staff and lots of other guests/locals just having a good time! When we arrived at our room we were greeted by a modern sophisticated, environmentally friendly, clean space! However due to the fact that this is a boutique hotel the rooms were too small for us (this time due to the fact we had so much luggage and we had 6 more days of travel) I should mention that although the rooms are small they have made good use of the space! My husband and I decided that it was just not the type of room we needed for this trip. I reluctantly made my way back to the front desk to ask if we could cancel our room and was expecting them to charge us for half of the stay which is the policy at almost every hotel and is also fair....I was happily surprised by an entirely different scenario...the gal at the front desk apologized for the room being to small and offered to move us to their slightly larger room which would have been great but another guest had specially requested that room for a portion of our stay, so instead the gal at the front desk cancelled our reservation, offered to make a new reservation for us at a different hotel and gave us 2 free drinks to use when we return to the pearl for supper (which we will because the food smelled great and the atmosphere was awesome!) In short...although we did not end up staying I wanted my review to show others that you DO NOT come across service like this often...even at 5 star properties...at the pearl they really do put guests first even if it means they lost out on a reservation!

It was rather difficult to find a hotel that could meet per diem rates in San Diego while providing a unique experience to the area. A little digging online and I found The Pearl. I took a chance and booked it for the whole 10 days of my trip. This turned out to be an excellent decision! What a fun place! The hotel is small and parking is limited, but they were extremely generous and hospitable. The hotel has a fantastic bar with about a dozen or so taps of all local crafted beer (no macro stuff on tap here) that was a real pleasure to drink. Their bartender manager has created some really delicious drinks here that at first may raise an eyebrow when reading the description, but will have you ordering another before you know it. Also the hotel does dinner every night, but Sunday. This is not your run of the mill sub-par hotel food either, these dishes are made to impress and they do at that. The presentation, taste, and ingredients are all something you would expect to see on a plate at a fine dining restaurant, but the prices can't be beat by comparison. You can get some exquisite scallops here for a little over twenty bucks. Also they have an appetizer of dates, stuffed with blue cheese and wrapped in bacon that's out of this world. It is a bit decadent, though, so share with a friend. My room was great. There was a Beta fish in a bowl named, Flo, to keep me company throughout the week. My room had a nice walk out patio and sitting area with a table and chairs that provided adequate privacy with walls separating you from the rooms to either side of you and wall of swaying bamboo to shield you from prying eyes from the buildings next door. It was a very relaxing setting. Since I was there on business I sometimes needed to get online with my laptop and I was pleased to find that the Pearl offers Wi-Fi complimentary to the room. And one great thing about that was I didn\u2019t have to deal with terrible internet speeds because it's not some massive chain hotel with hundreds of rooms sharing the same pipeline. This was a huge plus for me. One thing I should note, if you are an early riser you should be aware that there are many people that come to The Pearl simply for the bar and restaurant so the noise level could be a bit much for you if you are a light sleeper and need to go to bed before 11PM (when the bar closes on the weekdays). For me, none of these things were a problem. I found the noise level to be just fine and I was getting up at 6AM every morning. Go here and you will not be disappointed. The drinks are great, the food is great, and the staff is super friendly. They will engage in conversation with you and address you by name. For example, one evening while I was having dinner the chef came out for something and when I saw him I complemented the meal and the great beer on tap. We got to chatting and before long he was pouring tasters of all their stuff on tap and suggesting other great places to go for a drink. I love microbrews and brewpubs so this was all great info. Another night I got to talking with Jaime, the bar manager, who comes up with some really amazing and unique drinks at the hotel. Before long he was experimenting like a mad chemist and we were all trying out new drink prototype samples. If you want a place that is fun, relaxed, and friendly where you can get a great drink, a fantastic meal, and a nice room at a great rate then this is the place to go.

The place immediately caught my attention since it\u2019s a mid-century do-over that has a very unique styling and curb-side appeal. My compliments to Meaghan on the front desk...she's very pleasant and a wealth of info for me and other travelers too\u2026 an amazing asset for The Pearl! The location is very good as it\u2019s only a $10 buck cab ride from the airport, within walking distance to many local sights, and within walking distance, or a short bus ride, to downtown San Diego. My room (#10) overlooked the pool and was just fine for me; featuring a large low-strung bed on a wooden platform, a double size couch and a chair with wall mounted desk for laptop. The entire room overall, and the bed itself, was clean and crisp, compliments to the cleaning staff! Yes, they do have a \u2018fish\u2019 in the room and that\u2019s so cool. The d\u00e9cor is funk and hip and eye-appealing. There are plenty of towels in the bathroom plus spares by the pool. There is also a good quality iron and iron board in the room to keep your shirt crisp. PRO Funky d\u00e9cor, 60\u2019s style for sure, loved the fish, loved the clean linens, loved the area shag carpet, loved the \u2018live\u2019 plant, loved the a/c in the wall, loved the \u2018touch lamp\u2019 and loved the spiffy wall-mounted desk area for the internet connection, and LOVED the free internet too! Loved the large wall-mount flat screen TV. Loved that the bathroom is done-over okay with a new sink and toilet and dual light switches! Loved the lobby bar and the always entertaining customers; it\u2019s certainly a local attraction, and the restaurant too with such unique local offerings, great food! The pool itself is fine; it\u2019s warm and salted and kept clean...Thank you! And the pool-side heaters were a blessing during the Wednesday night movie. Speaking of movies, the large screen is pretty groovy and one of my main attractions for booking at The Pearl. Truly the best part of The Pearl is that it\u2019s an accepted part of the local community and it\u2019s patroned by the locals; simply put...an excellent atmosphere! CON Didn\u2019t like the fact I couldn\u2019t buy a beer at the hotel bar before 5pm, but I do understand Liquor laws. (There is a liquor store about 50 steps away and they have all the drinks, mixes, and snacks you need, along with great service too!) Didn\u2019t like that there was no fridge in the room, but they did offer to keep my beer in their fridge, loved that! Didn\u2019t like that there was no coffee maker in the room, overseen on my part (I never stay at a place without a coffee machine and fridge, but this was the exemption I guess), but the lack of coffee machine was tempered with the offer of free morning coffee at the lobby bar, and strong coffee too, a great wake-up bonus! RECOMMENDATIONS TO MANAGEMENT: THE ROOMS ARE GOOD OVERALL, COOL AND VERY CLEAN, THANK YOU. BUT DO CHECK OUT SMALL BATHROOM REPAIRS SUCH AS BENT SHOWER RODS, WORN BATHROOM FLOOR TILES, TUBS THAT HAVE THE PORCELAIN WORN OUT(MAYBE TIME FOR LINERS?) ALSO, DON'T FORGET TO REPLENISH THE H2O SPA BATH PRODUCTS ONCE THEY ARE GONE.

After finally staying, it more than lived up to the hype! I stayed in two rooms during my stay: the gem and the jewel. The first night was the gem, and it was the smallest room I have ever stayed in... however it was also one of the best for it's price (even compared to rooms three times it's size at other hotels!) I was easily able to plug my laptop into the HDMI port of the 42 inch tv mounted near the wall, and then sit on the bed and control some of the movies I have prepared for my evening. The bed itself was also VERY comfortable, and featured a very lightweight summer comforter sandwiched between two clean and very soft (high thread count I imagine) sheets. The second nights stay was in the Jewel. The jewel was much larger and had a larger bed as well. The bed was the exact same make it seems so it was also very comfortable, and there was again a large HD television (panasonic) in the room for me to plug my computer into easily via an HDMI port. Also in both rooms were two wonderful little beta fish (one per room) which me and my girlfriend found quite amusing (I've never seen fish in a hotel room before!) All in all, I would steer clear of the gem if you are claustrophobic or dislike small spaces, but if you're anything like me, and love cozy little places that are well furnished and VERY practical, then you will love the \"bachelor pad\" that is the gem. I have never stayed in the pearl's largest room as they were sold out both nights, but I can bet they are very nice! All in all, if you're looking for a luxurious get away, the pearl is not for you, but if you have an interest in something different you just might love it. The staff was also extremely friendly and helpful - some of the best i've ever experienced even compared to the nearby resorts.

However the hotel made up for this by giving us vouchers for the restaurant and some free drinks and got us in the right room for the rest of our stay. I have to say though, the staff did seem a little confused and overwhelmed at times and organization was not the best. The rooms themselves were nice. We had a pet fish which was a nice touch. We missed having a fridge though, and there wasn't much storage space for clothes etc. I can't help but get the feeling that they decided to spent the money on the look of the place rather than on the extra room provisions that would have made our stay a little more comfortable. They run a film night by the pool/bar which was a neat idea, except that we couldn't hear the film, so that kind of ruined that. Shame. You'd be better off going out for a nice meal/drink and going to the cinema afterwards!

The Pearl is truly a textbook example of not judging a book by its cover. The unassuming exterior of the hotel conveys that the building was once an apartment complex as it sits quietly on the corner of a residential neighborhood. Upon walking a path from the parking lot to the lobby, I noted that the courtyard of the hotel is taken up by pool and patio and had a very lively party underway in the middle of the afternoon. The lobby is essentially a small check in station to make more room for a cozy lounge opposite the bar and restaurant on the other end of the room. The lobby lounge area is essentially a collection of carpeted nooks with pillows and all manner of classic games such as Rock-em Sock-em Robot where guests could entertain themselves while they enjoyed a drink. Upon checking into our room we were delighted to find a very comfortable room decorated in an artfully retro and unique style. The vintage Art Deco theme works very well and I found the inclusion of our own beta fish to be a nice touch. I learned that each of The Pearl rooms come equipped with its own beta, each with their own introductary name plate. For our stay, Willie contently swam in his bowl offering a homey charm. The bed was extremely comfortable and the high-def flatscreen television offered several channels for viewing enjoyment. The room made great use of space and offered plenty of storage for extended stays, as well as a couch and table and all the usual amenities. The bathroom was full-size which gave me the understanding that at some point in its past our room had been a studio apartment. The platform bed was extremely comfortable and with a strong AC system, my wife and I slept very soundly during our stay. As active as the social scene was at the pool it was amazingly quiet in the room even with parties going on. I learned that The Pearl prides itself on being a very active hotel that appeals to energetic adults. This became very clear later in the evening when the hotel started showing its poolside movie. In keeping with the cool Rat Pack-era vibe and motif of the hotel, we watched classic episodes of Get Smart from the bar. While more modern films are shown it is nice to see that the hotel isn\u2019t afraid to mix things up now and then and having the option to either watch a movie from the poolside or from the bar overlooking the pool just emphasized the laidback and relaxed ambience. The cocktails offered by the bar were highly enjoyable and while we did not get a chance to enjoy the restaurant during our visit I noticed the extremely impressive menu and that the dining options has been cited for excellence in several publications. The hotel is located near Shelter Island in downtown San Diego and offers unique and value accommodations for travelers. There are several restaurants and convenience stores all within walking distance of the hotel should you choose not to dine on-site. This is good as parking is a bit limited at the hotel but the very friendly and helpful staff does have spots marked off by cones which can be accessed upon check-in. One does not normally find as comfortable a room in a friendly and energetic place when traveling, especially amongst the higher priced, more sedate hotels. It was refreshing to find such a unique place and friendly staff doing things their way instead of being a cookie-cutter of the larger chain hotels which often dominate the travelers options. The Pearl was a very unique and enjoyable experience punctuated by a friendly staff that went out of their way to ensure that the guests have a good time. Larger hotels can definitely take a lesson from these folks as they are clearly doing something right and I encourage you to check out The Pearl during your next visit to San Diego.", "Date": "July 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Gilbert, Arizona", "Title": "\u201cInteresting but fun\u201d", "Author": "Caseyg2011", "ReviewID": "UR115737952", "Content": "Well we booked a room here since my gf likes boutique hotels and laid back atmosphere they usually provide. This hotel was not in the area we thought it was in, actually it was pretty far from what we expected. As it turns out that was a good thing. We weren't to far from Ocean Beach which is a fun experience in itself, and not to far from Pacific beach as well. They provide free beach crusier rentals and we had fun taking those out to get around quicker. Now the Hotel itself is in a somewhat run down area, and there isn't anything to see unless you bike for 30 minutes but we had an adventure because of it. Downstairs as all the other review say is fun. You can play board games get a drink and hang with a mixed crowd of people while enjoying a seat by the pool. The room is average, maybe a little below. It was clean (other than stain on sheet) and for the age it was descent. But we need to point out that the age does make a difference. The bathroom is dated, and the basic feel is a converted Motel 6 into a retro style hotel. But then again we didn't stay in the room long so those facts didn't bother me. The staff was friendly and very personable which makes up for the hotels state of disaray. I would recommend this hotel if you are open minded, enjoy people and music, and like the out of the box experience that you can't have at a huge hotel.

I tend to veer towards boutique hotels because of the more intimate experience. When coming in from out of town, not knowing anyone, it makes such a difference when there's an approachable, friendly staff to chat around with and dig up local knowledge. I like well-designed spots, but admittedly, I shy away from hip, trendy hotels because too frequently the staff is stocked with snotty youngsters with attitudes. Right upon entering the Pearl I was greeted by the friendly front desk manager and given a little tour of the various areas of the hotel. Not only did the manager seem cool, I sensed right away she was very concerned about the quality of my stay not just at the hotel but in San Diego in general. On my second day she actually came up to me at the bar and gave me a heads up that a group celebrating a birthday booked a room next to mine. Anticipating they might get rowdy that night, she asked me in advance to let her know if I felt bothered. I really appreciated how she looked out for me- that simple gesture made me feel like a special VIP (and also probably prevented a negative review in Tripadvisor!) I liked how the bar, restaurant, pool, lounge were all integrated in the same area. This created a nice mixture of locals and hotel guests, everyone casually hanging out doing different things- eating, swimming, chatting, lounging. It wasn't a party scene, but definitely relaxed and lively on both weekend nights. I usually don't spend much time in rooms, but the rooms had a contemporary, simple, and beachy feel- not overdone. I was pleasantly surprised to find beds similar to those in a high price hotel. I slept so soundly.. The location to the airport was quick and easy. I had a free afternoon and borrowed one of the hotel beach cruisers (free!) and explored the Pt. Loma penninsula, Sunset Cliffs, as well as Ocean Beach community- it turned into a most memorable day of SoCAL sunshine and the beautiful ocean! Definitely a not-to-miss experience.

I\u2019ve never felt the urge to write a review of a hotel before, but I really wanted to for this hotel as I was so pleased we found this little gem & wanted to share our experience with others thinking of staying here. 7 of us Brits (age ranges between 30 & 62) arrived at the Pearl late on a Sunday night in November 2010 after driving from Las Vegas. The service we received at check in was great, we were advised on where to park our car (if you park on the street round the corner, its free as opposed to paying for parking outside) & were shown to our rooms. It was nearly midnight when we got our luggage out of the car & into our room when we discovered a (very minor) issue with our room. We weren\u2019t going to mention it to reception but thought we would bring it to their attention. Without going into lots of detail (as it would be boring!), we received the best service over our 4 day stay we have ever had on our many trips to the US from this hotel. The reception staff were fantastic in helping to resolve our problem & they went out of their way to make sure we enjoyed our stay at the Pearl. You can tell this isn\u2019t a chain restaurant & is a family run hotel as the little touches made a big difference to our stay. For example, they leave a note after cleaning your room each day telling you what the next day\u2019s weather will be & the menu for that evening\u2019s dinner at the restaurant. We were very fortunate to be offered a free meal at the hotel, to be totally honest we were hesitant at eating in the restaurant as we like to explore the local area rather than eat at our hotel for dinner. We were very pleasantly pleased at how yummy the food was, both my husband & I had the burger & loved it \u2013 they aren\u2019t lying when they claim it to be the best burger in the area! We were only disappointed that we left it till our last night to eat there as we would have had more food there had we ate there earlier. We ate in the outside little garden terrace & although it was a chilly November night, it has several garden heaters that made it a nice cosy area to eat & drink in. Before we headed out for the evenings, we had a few drinks in the bar \u2013 the beer drinkers in our party were impressed at the wide array of lagers & ales on offer. I had a lavender cocktail that I remember being very tasty indeed. There is a good seating area around the pool / cinema screen to enjoy drinks from the bar. With regards to the room, each one has its own fish tank on the wall which is something I\u2019d never seen before in a hotel & I loved this detail. Between us we had 4 rooms so I got to see all rooms & all were of good standard. The location is pretty good, we drove to SeaWorld, San Diego Zoo & Old Town \u2013 none of which took that long to get to. For the evenings that we went out into San Diego, the hotel rang up for a taxi & it didn\u2019t take long to reach our destination. Overall, I would rate this hotel very highly & if you are thinking about booking this hotel \u2013 I recommend that you do as you won\u2019t regret it. 6 months on, all 7 of us who went on the trip adored this hotel & we still talk about our stay there \u2013 it was a real highlight of our 2 week stay to Las Vegas, San Diego, Anaheim & LA.

For such a beautiful lobby/restaurant and modern room, we were unexpectedly disappointed by the customer service. We arrived a little early to check the place out and to inquire about early check in. Upon arrival, we were not greeted or acknowledged and when we asked WHERE check in was the girl at the desk abruptly said it wasn't until 3. It was approx. 1:30 pm. We didn't even have a chance to inquire about early check in. We came back after lunch and the same girl checked us in. There were no pleasantries of welcoming us to the hotel. The room was nice - modern with a beachy feel. The platform bed was comfortable, the bathroom was old, but renovated to look modern, the carpet was clean, and all the essentials were present (shampoo/conditioner, soap, lotion, and blowdryer). The lighting, however, was very dim with all the lights on and the heater/air very noisy. Overall, it was a comfortable room. And the fish was a unique touch. The other reviews were accurate about the noise level. It seemed like a popular place for people to hang out, even right outside our 1st floor room. We didn't mind since we were extremely tired from our morning of kayaking. Upon our check out, the same girl was at the desk. She didn't ask us how our stay was and did not thank us for our stay. I think I even thanked her without a response. Not only did we not receive a welcoming vibe from her, but also the other employees both at check in and check out. We appreciated the emails before and after our stay and our welcome postcard in our room, but those were the only things that showed us the staff cared. We would have rather received the same attention in person. The Pearl is a beautiful property and close to many restaurants, essentials, and attractions but I would not recommend the hotel to friends simply because of the hotel staff's lack of customer service. Customer service is extremely important in the hotel industry, especially in Las Vegas where I work, so I may be more critical than others.

We did come a bit early (4PM) so perhaps the spots were unoccupied for this reason. Walking into the lobby/bar was nice, it looked clean and inviting, and it set hopes up high for our room. The staff was excellent and very helpful. They were extremely friendly and warm. Finally, getting to our room was a different story. We stayed in the Jewel, and the room itself looked drab, like a downgraded version of the pictures provided on the website. There was a dead plant on the desk, the carpet was rough, there was a hair on the pillow, and the room in general was not completely clean, but it was still acceptable to stay in for a night. We tried to look past these little nuances but the bathroom is what ruined our stay. The bathroom inside of the room was filthy. Of course we didn't expect an upscale 5 star bathroom from The Pearl, but there was cracks in the tile with dirty grout, rust and dirt on what looked like a new faucet, permanent stains around the toilet, a weird glob of something on the wall, a big orange/brown spot on the shower curtain that looked strange along with many other dirty spots, and a bathtub with a filthy floor and cracks all through out. We took a piece of toilet paper and ran it across the top of the toilet paper dispenser only to find dust and a strange brown sticky liquid left on the toilet paper. The bathroom was the worst bathroom I have ever been in in any hotel, and I have been to some pretty downscale motels like Motel 6. Perhaps we got unlucky and received a badly renovated room, but if so, I still believe no guest should have to deal with a bathroom like that. Besides that, there was street traffic and noise from the bar downstairs, but the noise from the bar stopped at 10PM. The noise from the street seemed to be more distracting than the bar noise, and our room was close to the bar.

I knew enough about the hotel before hand to ask for a room away from the pool area. The lobby/restaurant/bar opens up to the pool area, and on some nights they offer movies in that area. The hotel and room over all was very clean. In the rooms I wish they would have luggage racks, that we could have used (as you know it's good to keep your luggage off the floor), this is why the back dresser shows a little wear/use on it's edges. The only real issues my friend and I had in room 18 was that the toilet would have wanted to run all night if we didn't open the back and reset the stopper every time we flushed (I did tell the front desk about this problem at check out, so maybe they have fixed it by now). We did forget to tell the desk that the bath tub looked dirty, and had what looked like old paint spots from painting the room(?). I didn't mind it too much, but my girlfriend likes to take baths, and she wasn't going to take one in that tub. Also their air conditioner in the room was a little noisy, we needed to use our ear plugs..

The Pearl is the result of a no-frills low-budget beach area motel trying hard to outclass and outsmart itself with unique touches that most other hotels that pop up nearby along Rosecrans Street would never bother to think up or care to spend the money on since their single proposition is to provide basic accomodations near the beach. For example, flat screen TVs...yes, in the room - but also next to the tables by the pool...and of course, hard to miss the huge projection screen facing the pool - part of their whole \"Dive in\" experience, a unique touch that no other low-budget motel that I know of has thought of. Yes, the rooms are small and relatively spartan but fresh updates abound in many locations both in and out of the rooms, which help to give a nice, more modern feel to the place. What I liked the most though was the dinner experience. I sat both nights at the bar for dinner and enjoyed conversation with the people next to me at the bar as well as with the bartenders. The menu is appreciated by many locals as well, so many of the guests who eat there are not actually guests of the hotel but instead are people who simply know the restaurant as a great place to eat. One thing that would be nice would be to have a small computer area so that guests can do things like print out boarding passes. I can understand why such a computer doesn't exist though, since the space in the lobby is so small. Perhaps an alternative solution could be to provide guests with an email address at check-in in case they need to print out anything at the front desk (so they can email the document to be printed out). I should say thought that the staff is very friendly and will gladly assist in printing out anything that you need printed out on their computer. Overall, this was a great experience. If your definition of boutique is purely upscale, then this may not be the place for you. But, if you enjoy modern updates coupled with some thoughtful retro design elements in lobby/lounge area, at a no-frills, low-budget price and are willing to concede on extra amenities and space, then this is the place for you.", "Date": "September 16, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vista CA", "Title": "\u201cRe-juvenate\u201d", "Author": "aliceVistaCA", "ReviewID": "UR79774776", "Content": "Revisit your youth.

The layout of the hotel is such that you enter into the reception/bar area that opens out on to the pool. The events take place in the bar / pool area. The staff made it clear that guests were welcome to all, and we didn't feel too awkward hanging out in the bar area however: 1) Ourselves and another two individual guests we befriended were unable to take a nap in the afternoons due to the noise of the events - particularly the skater party whereby the attendees congregated outside our rooms chatting and shrieking loudly. 2) The skater party was filled with underage drinkers, people smoking pot and the path to our room was completely blocked by the large group of teenagers outside our door. We were on the first floor so the path is an outdoor balcony that overlooks the pool.

I chose this place based on the excellent price, amenities, location, and positive reviews / pictures that were noted here. Our experience was top notch from start to finish. We purchased a package that included the cost of parking at the hotel. I highly recommend this as the hotel parking spots are limited and street parking can be challenging at times. The package also included two cocktails and an appetizer each day we were there. We had no idea how fantastic the food was going to be and when we did, we totally took advantage of those coupons. We ate dinner twice at the restaurant and had Sunday brunch. The food choices went beyond the ordinary (brushetta with squash...who knew?), the service was fantastic (Vanessa our waitress was friendly, knowledgeable and attentive), and the food quality was outrageous. We loved the restaurant so much we decided not to go out the 2nd night and dine in again after eating at the hotel the night before. The meals were affordable especially since we ended up getting an entree for free each night for a birthday special and because we used a coupon they have online. You can dine by the pool or inside, but regardless it is an open air restaurant with a great atmosphere which includes groovy tunes and a movie running at the Dive-In Theatre (soundless of course as the music sets the mood). We liked our room as it was clean, well decorated (60s retro), had quality electronics, and most importantly the bed was comfortable. The pet fish was also a great touch! The room was just big enough as we tend to be out more than we stay in. The pool is really a nice to have and I especially enjoyed cat naps in the hammock swings that are right next to it. The hotel was close in proximity to just about everything making it so easy and quick to get around: La Jolla, Sea World, Mission Bay, downtown, Balboa Park, Little Italy, etc... The staff went out of their way to help us get acclimated to the area and settled comfortably at the hotel. John even moved a table from inside to out by the pool for dinner when we asked for an outside seat and there weren't any left. Now that is what I call Service! Ironically we also ran into our waitress Vanessa at a local restaurant she had recommended where she greeted us with hugs and excitement! Overall this staff made us feel at home and even went beyond that by giving us VIP treatment without the VIP cost. Overall I would say this hotel is better for adults as the atmosphere lends to it. It is also a hot spot on the weekends so if a lively nightlife is not what you are looking for then this is not the place for you.

There were a number of serious problems with this hotel. First of all - despite booking and paying for a car parking space, there were none available. We ended up parking 4 blocks away and had to drag our luggage back to the hotel. A refund for one day's parking was provided (after we complained), but this was already an inconvenience. The design of the hotel was pretty cute, we enjoyed the pool and the cocktails, sure. Some of the decorations were a bit quirky in an attempt to be cool - the curtains fit the window perfectly, but letting a bunch of light around the edges. There was a goldfish in a bowl on the wall, although unfortunate little \"Pluto\" appeared to be dead. We were pretty interested in the restaurant menu - Lobster Mac and Cheese sounded cool. However we were told that the restaurant was closed during the evening of our stay (and was never open for lunch). Not too much of a problem as we were easily able to make other plans in San Diego, but a bit disappointing. The main problem was - we couldn't sleep. With an early drive on the morning of our check-out we planned to leave at 7am. The hotel was throwing a private party and extremely loud music was playing until midnight. When I say loud - I mean: the whole room we were staying in was vibrating from the bassline. The music was switched off sharp at midnight but this didn't really affect the noise levels - the soundproofing is so poor that we could hear individual conversations of the party guests who stuck around til the small hours (not to mention the road noise). The night porter would only say that \"we explain on our website that this is a lively hotel\". They also say on that website \"For quiet, in-room enjoyment, care is taken to limit sound levels.\" It's a lie. No compensation was offered whatsoever. We were made to feel very uncomfortable and the experience left me personally very angry. Also - we were told there was free wifi, but the password we were given for the wireless network was incorrect and we were unable to connect (note that we are computer literate - this was the hotel's problem) My main requirements for a hotel is that we are provided with a bed and quiet enough to sleep - this hotel was not able to provide that.

I think The Pearl is my dream hotel because it really did provide everything I want in a hotel. First and foremost, the style and vibe of the place is amazing. When we arrived on a warm July Sunday around noon, there was a full-fledged pool party going on! Everyone was lounging around with drinks and listening to some great music poolside, some were finishing their brunch which is served every Sunday during the warm months. I didn't get a chance to join the fun that day, but I was jealous of those who did. It's an great example of mid-century googie architecture, but the owners have done an amazing job of renovating the place with one eye on maintaining it's vintage charm and the other eye on tasteful, hip modern design. I love the fact that they brought new life to this old hotel. There is a kidney bean shaped pool in the center courtyard and set next to it is an open-air full bar and restaurant. I think there are probably less than 20 rooms total at The Pearl which makes for a boutique feel. Despite the party in the courtyard, our room was quiet and a great place to relax. It was all brand new and styled like it should be featured in Dwell magazine. Wait, has this place been featured in Dwell? If not it should be. The room had a flat screen TV, lots of Ikea style furnishings, and a very comfortable bed. Oh, and it came with a goldfish named Cosmo! He swam around quietly in his bowl and was a great roommate. The location is great, very close to Downtown San Diego and the whole surrounding area, with restaurants all around. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The one issue is that you have to be careful about parking in the neighborhood. Apparently the police like giving tickets for the smallest parking infractions. However, the staff is very interested in helping that not be a problem for the guests, they will give you pointers and even spot for you while you park your car. So, not a problem really, just be careful parking your car. The The Pearl is my dream hotel because it has great prices, an amazing pool, clean, comfortable and stylish rooms, a welcoming staff, a full bar and restaurant, great and unique architecture and interior design, and it's in a perfect location.

Eesh! With what promised to be an interesting and possibly overwhelming weekend ahead of us, the last thing we wanted to deal with was the hassle of finding the right hotel at the right price. Enter The Pearl... DRUMROLL PLEASE...I absolutely LOVE this place! I called on a Thursday and was able to book a room immediately for the following two nights. The person I spoke with over the phone was amazing. His name's Tom and was so friendly and incredibly helpful. There are three types of rooms available, The Gem, The Jewel, and The Strand. We booked one of The Jewels for $109 a night, which was a surprising $20 CHEAPER than if you booked the same room through http://Expedia.com. When I got off the phone with Tom, I was so excited for the weekend I could hardly sleep that night. When we got into San Diego (Point Loma, to be precise), we headed down Rosecrans to find The Pearl. Upon arriving, the parking situation left much to be desired. Valet parking is $10 a night and I'm not one for unnecessary expenses so we parked a couple of blocks away and hoofed it. When we entered the hotel, I was blown away by the decor. The vibe is retro-beach-glam. Is that a real thing? No? Well, I just made it up, so HA. The furniture has that sleek futuristic look that was the height of coolness in the 50s and 60s. There are plenty of candles and mirrors on the walls that work with some colored bulbs to create unique and beautiful lighting. The pool area is fun and hip, complete with a huge mounted movie screen that they call the Dive-In Theatre. They do movie nights where you can hang in the pool or on the comfy pool-side seating and catch a flick while enjoying a drink or two from the hotel bar. Our room was totally cool-- cozy and welcoming--even better than the hotel's website had led us to expect. It had a 42\" flat screen TV, a king-size platform bed with soft (and CLEAN) sheets and fluffy pillows. There was ample closet space although we wouldn't need it for just the two nights, and the bathroom was spotless. The hotel provides H2O products for the standard shampoo-conditioner-lotion trio and I must say, the lotion made it's way into my purse in less than ten minutes and stayed there for weeks while I squeezed every last drop out of it. We also had our own little patio but the best part of the room? The beta fish! Every room has their own little beta fish in a bowl mounted on the wall. It was such an unexpected detail and I thought it was totally cute and original. Because it was such a short stay, we didn't have a whole lot of interaction with the staff. Upon checking out we had to wait a while as the front desk clerk was nowhere in sight but when she showed up she was really sweet and made sure we'd had a great stay. We were really busy with family stuff so we also missed out on having dinner and drinks at the hotel restaurant but we'll try that out during our next stay. All in all, we were really pleased with the experience. The room was great, the pool area made us wish it was about 20 degrees warmer, and the overall vibe was totally in sync with our own style, although I wish parking weren't such a pain in the tookus.

Yuk! - we called the front desk and they promptly came to clean it up. But that wasn't the end of it. We were promised by the website a large flat screen TV. - true, but it didn't really work. Each time I turned it on, it would immediately turn back off. I finally figured out that if I turned it on and immediately changed the channel it would stay on. But then when I turned it off, it turned itself back on. Bizarre. We were also promised wi-fi, which again - DID NOT WORK! Neither did the in-room radio system. sigh. The room was quite small and while they had tried to update the look - the remodel was done on the cheap! The rain style showers drizzled water that was either burning hot or ice cold - and again, hard to turn off and on as the nozzle turned endlessly in either direction. The room layout was OK but it was very dark and dank. And while the room was supposed to have a king size platform bed - they obviously went cheap and bought some sort of irregular sized mattress for a big discount. The platform itself was king sized, but the mattress ended more than a foot before the end of the platform. Turns out it was only 6 feet long - MUCH shorter than a King and my poor boyfriend spent the night with his feet hanging off the end! Oh yeah, and there is basically no parking available. When we complained, the staff was quite rude and unhelpful to us. The service was definitely amateurish. We didn't have any food or drinks - so if you are looking for a bar - this might be a good place to go as the bar was busy at night.

I read all the reviews before we went, so I was under no illusions that this would be a quiet place, a luxurious place, or a perfect hotel. We had never stayed at a non-chain, and I wanted to check it out anyway. We really enjoyed our stay. We checked in on a Monday, and not too many guests were staying on a Monday. I was prepared to ask for a room away from the pool area if necessary, but we got one without asking. (Number 17.) It was near a side street, so street noise wasn't too bad, but we had to run the AC at all times because the room got really stuffy if we did not, and the AC was very loud. Still, if you don't mind loud fans running, that doesn't seem like a big deal to me. Plenty of chain hotels are the same way. Some of the rooms are RIGHT next to the pool. I wouldn't have liked to stay in one of those rooms. A few of the reviews mentioned that there was no place for breakfast nearby. This is not true (or I guess it may be true depending on your definition of breakfast). A Starbucks and a smoothie place are about two blocks away, and there was another restaurant that appeared to be serving breakfast maybe 3-4 blocks away, although we did not check it out. It is not the most pedestrian-friendly area, but it is possible to get to these places without an automobile. Also - the restaurant does have coffee available in the mornings. They set up a coffeepot at the bar. One day the cleaning people did not clean the room while we were out, but I was able to find someone to ask about getting clean towels in the meantime, and the cleaning crew was still around, so the room was cleaned when we went out again later. The food at the restaurant was phenomenal. I had this mushroom risotto that was just wonderful, and the drinks were great too. We ended up splurging for a daily guaranteed parking spot. It was our honeymoon, after all. I think it was $25 a day. This required us to ask someone to move a cone to our spot after we left for the day, but after the first time we just did it ourselves rather than bother anyone. Street parking seemed to be relatively available, but it was still nice to have that guaranteed spot and not have to worry about it. We paid in cash, and they were not really equipped to handle payment in cash. They didn't have any change, and the bar was not open. Fortunately we didn't really need the change, so we just told them to tip the cleaning crew.

Sometimes staying in cheap motels is the way to go and you don't expect the most comfortable bed. However, for a romantic getaway, when you're really thinking hard about where you want to stay and have the cash to stay in a wide variety of properties, it is a huge disappointment when even the basics aren't met by a hotel that looks like it ought to just fine. The website looks awesome. While I saw some of the negative reviews here: small rooms, noise from both the club (it's a club, ok!) and the road (wow, that is a surprisingly busy road!), what no one mentioned is that the beds are CRAZY BAD. Cheap, soft beds and crappy pillows. It is like staying in a dorm room. It was one of the worst night sleeps I've had in a long memory and certainly not the quality I was expecting. I could feel the springs in my back on the lousy mattress. Yikes! Here's what I disliked about this hotel besides the terrible, low end bedding. 1. Shower was broken. 2. Room had strange moldy smell, like bad venting from hotel and our room felt very airless quickly, even in the cool night. 3. Loud (it is, after all, just a cheap, badly constructed roadside hotel on a busy road...) and so everyone who mentioned how loud it was, I agree! Wow, it was loud! And we had the room in the far, back corner, though it seems next to some kind of generator. 4. Dying fish in room. Our little fish, colorless, lifeless and barely alive. Yikes! A gimick gone horribly wrong... 5. Burnt out light bulb in hallway: it's a small thing, but that's what sets apart a good boutique hotel from a dingy highway motel right? It was hard to see the lock on our door. Again, the expectation, based on the website was pretty high... We had one of the four deluxe rooms and I would definitely have not wanted anything smaller. It did not feel deluxe and did not match the website expectation. I'll mention the service. In a word, definitely NOT boutique service... the bartender had to look up how to make a Manhattan (which was terrible), the front desk did not know how much it would cost to take a cab to the airport, the waitress did not know if there would be coffee in the morning (there's no coffee pots in the rooms) and had to think of places to recommend... it just seemed like everyone was new and you'd think based on the extreme BRANDING and professional gloss they put on everything that traveler basics would be drilled into the staff. Finally, let me mention dinner. Slow night on a Monday, even with the Prix Fixe menu, but it still took over two hours to get our appetizer, dinner and dessert and not in that happy French cafe slow service way. Waitress was apologetic, explaining that they only had one chef in the kitchen but then they only had three tables going! If the chef can't handle three tables, boy howdy. Our dinner order was mixed up with wrong food and while they ended up comping the meal generously, it certainly wasn't how we expected to spend a good chunk of our evening in San Diego. We waited and waited and waited. Though it gave us more time to drink wine out of plastic cups since we sitting next to the pool. Oh! the indignity! The romance ruined! This hotel would likely be just fine and fun if you were there for one of the party nights, thought you'd get some action and romance, and booked a room using their after midnight love special. Maybe that would be fun. I'm not terribly pissed off at the experience since I like trying non-chain hotels and got a room for $99.00 off-season special, but it was DEFINITELY NOT the experience I was hoping for (a special end to a great holiday) and felt the website and presentation was misleading enough to post my first review on this site as a warning to others.

I looked around and did a lot of research on local hotels and was really excited to snag a room here. We usually stay at bigger chains like the W, Westin or Omni, but I thought a little boutique hotel (that is in the fun Point Loma area) would be a nice change. Unfortunately it didn't quite work out as hoped. The average rates for 2-star chains (Ramada, et al) are about $150. Higher end (W, Hard Rock, Omni) are about $300. This was in the high middle, about $255 after taxes. The girl on the phone offered me a free room upgrade (from queen bed to king), which was nice of her. I also signed up for the \"essentials package\" (free parking plus 1 appetizer and 2 drinks at their restaurant/bar) for an additional $35. Essentials package is fine for the money - if you want the drinks and apps. Parking was nice, because the street parking is hard to come by on a weekend. Good news is there's free wireless internet. Better news is that ll of the staff are really cool, friendly and accommodating. From the check-in girl (who saved a parking spot for me in the tiny lot with her own car) to the bartender (who took good care of me, even though she was slammed with a party), they all were really sweet and ran their butts off taking care of the guests. Best part was that the food was surprisingly delicious. We had late-night snacks, desserts and drinks in our room and were THRILLED. The hotel is TINY. There's a tiny pool surrounded by tiny rooms. Our room had a king bed (quite comfy) that nearly took up the whole space. The shower was nice (love the rain showerhead), except that it was a little grimy. Could have been cleaner. It was noisy because the bar is around the pool, which is 4-feet from our door. We had to keep the blinds closed or the bar people could see right in. Weird. Luckily the air-conditioning unit was really loud (in a good way) and drowned out the people noises. We slept really well. The unfortunate part is is that the website makes it look WAY cooler than it is. It looks like a groovy mid-century hotel (like the fabu Horizon in Palm Springs) that offers a chill time. Maybe lounge around the pool and kick back with a mai tai and some fondue. Re-reading their website after the fact, they do mention a \"spirited nightlife scene\" and that \"occasionally, the energetic buzz of good times can be heard in-room...\" and that, \"...care is taken to limit sound levels.\" Um, okay? I don't know if there's a college around there, or something, but this was basically a frat party. It's 20-somethings running a hotel and bar that caters to 20-somethings. Definitely go there if you A) want to be in Point Loma, B) like to party and be loud, C) are 21-30, D) get a rate of $160 or less, or 5) can sleep through noise. Overall a decent enough place.

So I took my wife there as a belated birthday present. If you are a design buff, especially mid-century or modern, you get it. Some people just won't get it since there are numerous run of the mill roadside franchise hotels nearby. Its a wonderfully not-overdone restoration/modernization of a late 50's or early 60's hotel, with all the best parts preserved. At the front, its not immediately obvious that its different from its more modest neighbors. The first clue that this is something different is the valet service. Next is the upscale restaurant, in of itself unusual in an under 50 room hotel. The restaurant is very open-air and resort like, with seating spilling out around the pool; and with an architecturally blended movie screen over the pool on which mid-century classics are shown during evening hours (we saw 007 Dr. No). Dinner was long and liesurely, since the surroundings were so comfortable. We just didn't want to leave - not to mention that our room was just accross the pool. The room (#9 - \"The Strand\") was large with a sofa seating area large enough to be its own room, a wide plasma tv, and a balcony overlooking the pool. The bed was nice and firm, the sheets and bedding clean, the bathroom facilities large, modern and luxurious (what do you call those wide ceiling showerheads and separate handheld shower nozzles?). The design throughout is mid-century modern yet warm - about the best I've seen this genre done. What also amazed me was the great number of interesting spaces and amenities packed into a hotel of this size. Lots of lounges, board games, balconies, nooks, and items of visual interest - all in earth and water tones, giving a feeling of warmth. There are even beach cruiser bicycles for guest use. The staff was very friendly and attentive (and probably saved our two year old's life). The location is close to the harbor, and central to downtown, the beaches, and San Diego attractions. About the only complaint I had was unavoidable due to its newness - i.e., the fresh paint and carpet smell. Anyway, think the Dub-U or one of those hip little South Beach hotels - at about half the price, but for my money better. But if your just looking for an adequate place to crash, without interest in an onsite restaurant, heated pool, or other little luxuries, you can stay accross the street. But if you want more, this is a great alternative to the newest downtown hotels at half the price.", "Date": "October 13, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mission Viejo, California", "Title": "\u201cGreat staff - but BUGS at the Pearl!\u201d", "Author": "anieto_mv", "ReviewID": "UR10054152", "Content": "Stayed at the Pearl this last weekend for a one night getaway with my boyfriend. Paid $200 for The Jewel thru cheaprooms.com and am sad to say it wasn\u2019t worth it. From the outside the Pearl looks like a 1970\u2019s small apt complex or motel. Valet came out right away to greet us and direct us to the front desk. Will praise the staff \u2013 extremely nice and helpful. Check in was easy \u2013 would imagine it would be since its just a gal behind an office desk with a laptop. The pool area is small but looked really inviting \u2013 chilled water with lemon and fresh towels are already out by the pool. Made me wish I brought that polka dot bikini. Room was nice but a bit on the small side. PROs: Friendly-courteous staff, brand new \u2013 can smell a hint of fresh paint, bed was very comfortable, nice linens and comforter, flat screen tv, and loved our pet fish \u201cAce\u201d. 10 minute drive to Old Town, Downtown/Gaslamp district. Close to the harbor. CONs: There was only one mirror (in the bathroom) would imagine that a floor length mirror would be somewhere in the room especially if the hotel is trying to appeal to a young adult scene. Hairdryers are provided but don\u2019t really provide hot air and are quite heavy. And lastly, 3 bugs! LOL We were lying on the bed when a quite large, fat spider crawled across the headboard. I\u2019m not one to freak out; spiders tend to be everywhere. We squashed it \u2013 no worries. A couple hours later I went into the rest room and saw what we initially thought was a 2 \u00bd\u201d long, black crack near the bathtub. Imagine our surprise when it started moving and we realized it was a caterpillar or another crawly like creature, which we laughed and disposed off ourselves. Later on I was blow-drying my hair when a cockroach ran behind the toilet and sink. Boyfriend took a picture of it with his cell phone and at this was pretty grossed out. We\u2019ve stayed in various hotels together, ranging from an America\u2019s Best Value Inn ( wouldn\u2019t even give it half a star) to the W, Hyatt, or Marriott chain. Have never, ever seen a bug \u2013 let alone a cockroach. He called the front desk and the young lady was extremely apologetic and offered to move us \u2013 but we were already running late for our dinner reservation and told her we\u2019ll have to stick it out. We didn\u2019t encounter anymore creepy crawleys and mentioned the complaint again at check out. Front desk was unable to comp us on our room since it was already paid thru cheaprooms.com but comp\u2019d us our valet ($15 value). At best I would consider the hotel a step up from a good Motel 6. For $200 it doesn\u2019t have the in room amenities it should, bathroom also had chips in the floor tile, a long crack on the bathroom wall, and the bathtub drained really slowly. Wouldn\u2019t stay at the hotel again unless rooms were at a $75-80 rate and managed to take care of their insect situation. Highly recommend Humphrey's By the Bay - a little pricey but food was wonderful, wished we would have considered a room at Humphrey's Inn.", "Date": "October 8, 2007"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "The Pearl Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g60750-d658421-Reviews-The_Pearl_Hotel-San_Diego_California.html", "Price": "$108 - $198*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">1410 Rosecrans St (at Fenelon)</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">San Diego</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">CA</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">92106</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "2515685", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/98/82/98820225f5c01e6d9f1caa4dae5bb9413large.jpg"}}
