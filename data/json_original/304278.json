{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Good service. Only OK Staff very friendly and very accomodating. Rooms were great and resort was very well maintained. Dinner was good at the main restaurant but poor at the beach. Breakfast was about the worst I could ever imagine for a 5 star hotel. They advertise wireless internet in rooms but it was very very slow. You had to take your computer to the lobby to use properly and was a hassle but speed in lobby was fast.Frankly, I was dissapointed because you shouldn't have these problems with food and internet from a 5 star hotel and based on the high cost of the room.", "Date": "Nov 29, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR565755580", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "IndoSum"}, {"Content": "My second Home! This is my second trip to the Matahari and I am already planning my return. It is the most beautiful and relaxing place on earth although some people might find it too quiet. I cannot compliment the staff enough and have never had cause for complaint. The Matahari prides its self on treating guests as individuals and as one member of staff replied to me following an unusual request This is the Matahari Madam, anything is possible I cannot recommend this resort highly enough and the food and wine are second to none.", "Date": "Sep 24, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR165854174", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "kerill"}, {"Content": "Perfect! After 4 Years first trip to the Matahari Beach Resort we came back on a round trip on Bali for only 4 days. It was like coming home. The hotel is for us really something special on Bali, there are so many beautiful details on every place. The complete hotel and garden is made in a real Bali-Style with lot of wood, special stone-art and beautiful garden places. Within about 32 Villas in different sizes the Matahari is a beautiful boutique-Resort in the North. The Beach is small, but absolutely o.k. for mostly only the Hotel Guests. On the beach is the second wonderful restaurant, were you can take lunch or dinner or enjoy only Relaxing-time. The food is really good, we prefered Half-Board-booking, because out of the hotel are not much restaurants an we loved to stay in this beautiful atmosphere in the hotel. Prices a like in Europe! If liked , the hotel will arrange a lot of day tours on Bali to have a look to the country and people.Another highlight is the Parwathi-Spa, because to have only a look to the architectural Style is great and relaxing pur. But much better are the different Spa-Treatments, we tryed. Perfect also!After 3 days in the Hotel -the middle of our Bali Time, we had to leave, it was terrible and with tears in my eyes. The feeling in the Hotel, the kindly Staff and the feeling like at home... we just thought to stay longer and cancel the following Hotels, but we didn\u9e93t! After 3 weeks perfect holiday in Bali, we can say  See you again Matahari- for us a special hideaway!", "Date": "Apr 6, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR248778995", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "CKoenig"}, {"Content": "Absolutely Perfect! This must be the best hotel in Bali. It's far away from the crowds and the perfect beach get away. Staff is very friendly and helpful. Absolutely everything is perfect. The food is fantastic! The whole compound is really beautiful, with flowers and statues. There is also a dive centre nearby, where you can do diving and snorkeling tours. The only criticism I have is that the prices for dinner and the spa are quite high for Bali. If you're after a bargain holiday then this wouldn't be the place to go. If you're after a relaxing beach getaway this is the perfect place to go!", "Date": "Sep 29, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR310677575", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "the_hoff_meister"}, {"Content": "Pleasure of senses       The lava beach", "Date": "Jul 23, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR212473097", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Maoh"}, {"Content": "Beautiful resort in North Bali       bedroom", "Date": "Jul 6, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR849687165", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "kinaco"}, {"Content": "Nice hotel with some weak points Beach beside the hotel and the whole area around the hotel very dirty.
