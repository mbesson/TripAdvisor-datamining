As soon as I saw my room, I wanted to go and spend my own money to stay in a nicer hotel.

I came down right away to ask for another room, and the young lady at the front desk said the hotel was full, in addition to having an attitude. Fortunately the tour guide offered me another option, and when I went to see it there was only a skylight, and the room looked like a attic, so I kept the original room. I really would have left and stayed somewhere else if I was not traveling with a friend. She convinced me to stay, and reminded me that we would only be sleeping there 1-night, then moving on to what we were hoping would be a much nicer hotel. (Fortunately it was!!)

Fantastic food,and very reasonable. Also there's a lovely restaurant a couple of blocks away owned by an ex Italian rugby player. It serves traditional roman style food over five courses at a cost of just 25 euros and the house wine is only 8 euros per caraffe(The restaurant is on a road called via bittolo and it's called Angelo.)

This is the ONLY hotel we had booked where they speak English. And what a GODSEND! I can't even tell you what a relief it was. The friendly, helpful staff were lifesavers. I left my luggage at the previous hotel and it took 4 days of phone calls from the Hotel Nova Domus front desk staff to my previous hotel to get my luggage back. Also many faxes had to be exchanged. It was a nightmare. Despite many daily phone calls back and forth, the staff at Hotel Nova Domus were utterly polite and calm and never seemed to be bothered by all the hassle I was putting them through to get my stupid luggage back. YOU GUYS ROCK!! Breakfast buffet was THE BEST we had in Italy on our 14 days there. Good old American style buffet: Omelets! Hard boiled eggs! Bacon! Plus every kind of toast, fruit, yogurt, cereal that you can think of. Most hotels in Italy serve \"Italian style\" breakfast which means: cakes and cold cuts and yogurt. It was sooooooo wonderful to taste an American style breakfast again, just to taste EGGS again! You can't even imagine. TV in room had an actual ENGLISH speaking channel! I think it was BBC or CNN which was fantastic as most Italian hotels never have english tv. Everyone staying here is with some kind of english speaking Tour Bus trip so you feel right away that you are almost back on \"friendly American soil\"...just hearing your own language is refreshing after 10 days without it. :) Room is very tight but we expected that for the price. Bathtub was VERY old as was whole bathroom (but also that's normal for Italy too). Nobody believed this was 4 star hotel as its got a tattered canopy out front and is across from a chinese restaurant in a dangerous looking neighborhood. But the customer service and breakfast made up for it! Location really sucked as there is nothing to walk to or do nearby within about 6 blocks. However, with a cab you can be at Vatican in 10 minutes or so. If you have car or scooter, it's perfect location - free gated parking at hotel. Gelateria across street was pretty bland but if you don't care much about gelatto, it's probably ok. I recommend the Dark Chocolate combined with the Pear Ricotta Cheese...mmm!! The pizzeria across street and to the right is AWESOME!! The best pizza we had our whole trip across Italy was served there.

The hotel was larger than I had expected, with wide hallways and about 20 rooms on each of its five floors. The hotel is within a 10-minute or so walk from both the Vatican and the nearest metro/subway station. Once I knew where to look, I could actually see the top of the dome of St. Peter\u2019s from my window (although I had to be practically standing on the window sill, but I could see it!).

Shocked what happened to us in Nova Domus Hotel. Someone entered into our room while we were out, and stole 620 euro from the hidden place. I always kept the money with me, only 2 days before our leave I decided to seperate the money that I wanted to pay the hotel bill, and hide it in my luggage, in a very safetly place which I thought. Looks like someone was following us every day,and then we were not there, they entered and did their dirty job. The reason I didn't put the money in safety box , because a lot of people were telling me that their money got stolen from safety box too, not specificly from that hotel. So I reported the hotel management and the police station. Police officer was laughing and saying that your money is gone. \"Thank you for letting me know that.\" Hotel personnel was helpful but was speachless, especially the manager. He gave me 10% discount. Thank you for that, but the fact that they have an employee who is after tourists money is a reality. They said I should've keep valuables in safebox. I explained them how about I have very expensive clothes, or coat, how I can keep it in the safebox. Someone from their employees is a thief. I felt so unsecure in that hotel. The strange feeling was following me that any minute they could've enter and even put a gun on our head to ask money, as long as they had the key and could've done that very professionally with no signs of robbery. That's the feeling stayed with me when I left Italy. Other than that Italians are good people, and Rome is nice. Find hotels next to Termini or Piazza Popolo. For the airport Shuttle from your hotel call [--]. You will pay 28 euro and plus 6euro for each person, or else hotel will offer you to pay 65euro. For tours it is better to talk to the right agent and you will get bargain prices. For open bus tours we paid 12euro for each of us, hotel was offering 19euro. For metros and busses get a 3 day pass, and all day long you can use bus or metro to any where, so you can save money. There is a market on Sundays at Porta Portese. You can get a lot of things with very good price, but be aware of thieves again. When you go to musuems your shoulders should be covered, keep a scarf or jacket with you. I went to Villa Borgese, and it is far away and they said they are full, it means it is better to check that you can enter and then go there.", "Date": "July 21, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Georgia", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Hotel in Rome\u201d", "Author": "djpart1230", "ReviewID": "UR35004910", "Content": "We chose this hotel online due to its location. It is literally on the \"street\" to the Vatican City. The hotel Desk clerks speak excellent English, and are extremely helpful in any area you need. We arrived about 11:30 and check in is at 2:00. We expected to wait, but were given our room immediately. The staff brought our luggage up. I think if we would have asked them to unpack our suitcases, they would have! The hotel is very sharp. It has a lot of beautiful plants and greenery. The waiting are is extremely inviting! Elevator or stairs to the 5 floors. A large restaurant which serves a contiental breakfast (cheeses, meats, eggs, rolls, sweet rolls, drinks of all kinds, and so many other assortments). You have the option of sitting indoors or out on the patio (where little birds might peek at you while you are eating). The patio is lovely with beautiful plants and trees in large terracotta containers. The food was excellent. The restaurant is open for dinner as well, however, we were never there for dinner...Always out seeing the sights! They also have a \"lounge\" at the top of the building where you can sit ad have a drink (alcohol or non-alcohol) and look out onto the streets and see Rome as the evening approaches. You view so many beautiful window plants and so many trees and plants on the roofs! The hallways are very wide... not your usual narrow European hallways. Two wheelchairs could go side by side! The halls are decorated with beautiful artwork from ancient and current Italy. The room really surprised us! We have traveled extensively in Europe and always have had a \"small\" room where you can hardly have space to sit. But to our surprise, when we opened the door, it was so roomy and beautiful. The bathroom was much larger than expected. One could shower and the other shave or whatever... Also they had a blowdryer available. Many little toiletries available. Good size shower and good water pressure. They also have a \"bideau\" (not sure of spelling). There was a very large wall closet for hanging clothes and drawers for other clothing. A small wall safe was also in the room. The bed was good size and so very comfortable! I have a bad back and each night, after walking all day, my back was THANKFUL for the mattress on the bed. We had a large window that opened up and we could look down onto the stree. We had a neighbor across the way with a dog (a white dog with one large area of black over his eye) who would sit in the window and watch the traffic. (We were in room 210) So European... it was great. Also an A/C that worked great, but we love the fresh air and used the open window at night. The area was quiet (Thank God!) so we were able to sleep very comfortably. There was a small TV that got many stations but only one in English (CNN). We aren't big TV watchers so we read our books, and usually fell dead asleep quickly. The room was done up every day (we stayed 4 days) . It almost seemed like she redid the sheets daily... So clean and crisp! Any personal items stayed as put. There were new towels etc every day. The maids were all dressed like \"the Nanny\". They were so cute! There was a large bureau with a large mirror and a top drawer for makeup, papers, whatever. The hotel is a quick walk to grocery stores, shops, bus stop, Metro and the BEST ice cream shop is right across the street! You get 3 scoops of any kind. The two of us had one every day and only paid 4.50 Euro for the both of them! My overall opinion is that I WILL go back to that hotel the next time I go to Rome.

The hotel is certainly not a five minute walk to/from Cipro metro station, and I consider myself a very fast walker, it is at least fifteen minutes down a very long road. Regarding location again the hotel is about ten minutes from the VATICAN MUSEUM, but a good twenty five minutes from the actual Vatican (St Peter's Square). There are no shops about to buy drinks/snacks from and the hotel is miles away from the other central attractions, but this isn't really a problem if you use the metro. Our room was on the second floor and upon arrival we immediately noticed how dark the room was, there was hardly any natural light at all seemed to be obscured by horrid hurricane like shutters that could not be moved up or down. The room was very hot, AC not working and we had a lovely view of a basketball court. Beds are like sleeping on a concrete slab with matching slab pillows; I have never in my life slept on such uncomfortable beds. Other than that room size not too bad, had a nice LCD TV but with no English channels at all, BEWARE internet is thirty five cents per minute. The staff were very unhelpful, on three separate occasions did we request extra pillows, we were pointed in the wrong direction twice to the nearest shop and there porter who carried the bags seemed to be loitering outside our room whenever we left/came back to the hotel. We were also made to wait to be seen whilst the receptionist spoke on the phone several times, breakfast as mentioned by previous guests was not something to write home about. We arrived everyday at 8:15am and the eggs/bacon looked to have been there all night, dirty culterly, juice so watered down I couldn't even tell what flavour it was and bread so hard it could have been used as a weapon. All this luxury was provided in what could have passed for a tomb it was so dark, I have no idea why they didn't open the curtains; my only though is that doing so would mean they'd have to clean the windows, which obviously is something that hasn't been done since the late 1990s.

The police were rude if you asked for help regarding anything, they were only interested in smoking whilst trying to look at passing females whilst worrying about how they looked.

Rome itself was very scruffy with grafitti everywhere,which spoiled the look of this famous city. The prices of food and drink were extortionate.(5e for a soft drink)Try and find a supermarket where the prices were reasonable. My tip would be to buy a 4euro ticket for the day which allows you unlimited travel on the Metro, tram or bus. All in all i would definitely recommend the Nova Domus, but be warned, take a lot of spending money if you want to enjoy yourself.", "Date": "December 17, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "DALLAS TEXAS", "Title": "\u201cNot quite what we were planning on\u201d", "Author": "Dallasite7", "ReviewID": "UR22089063", "Content": "WE booked this Hotel mostly because it advertiised how close it was to the Vatican.

Nova Domus is nicely located in a quiet area of the city and at a walking distance from the Vatican. Just 5-10 minutes walk from the hotel, there's an underground station Cipro, where you can take the underground to the historic center - very convenient. We stayed 5 days in Rome and bought a one-week ticket (17 e) for each of us. That was very convenient for us when traveling around without worrying about tickets, and we used both the buses and the underground a lot. There's a stop for two long bus lines conveniently just outside the hotel. We stayed 4 nights at a 4-person room, which was perfect for us - two adults and two teen-age kids (15 and 18). We first considered the family room, which looks nice on the photos, but checked the size of the beds from the hotel and found out that the children's beds are just 180 cm long. Since our son is 190 cm long, the quadruple room with 4 normal length beds was a better alternative for us. The main room was large with 3 beds, and it was adjoined with a single-room-size entrance room with one bed. It looked like kids' beds had extra hideaway beds underneath. However, the size of the room was just perfect for the 4 of us. The breakfast room was nice with a good variation of foods and drinks. The hotel personnel was very helpful. The advised us about a small Internet cafe across the street and up the stairs round corner. Just 1,50 e per hour - much appreciated by our kids. (The hotel also has an in-house internet workstation on the first floor, but it costs 5 e per 15 minutes!). When we were checking, the hotel personnel offered to get a taxi for us in the evening to take us to the airport. The price 50 e for all four of us was very reasonable (the train tickets from Termini to the airport would have been 44 e) and we were saved from dragging our luggage in the underground and standing in the train corridor all the way as we had to do on arrival. The taxi was nice and modern, however driver drove like a maniac - 170 km/h on the motor highway, but at the end we got to the airport safe and sound. The price level at Nova Domus is much more favorable than in the very touristic center of the city. For us with 4 persons on board, that makes a difference.

Effectively, because the room rate advertised was so low, I had to book blind. All I was told until payment had been confirmed was that it was a 4* hotel, double room bed and breakfast for 2 nights within walking distance of the Vatican. Considering the price I paid (extremely reasonable) I was extremely chuffed. However this did not last long once I read the reviews. I was absolutely dreading going and really was expecting the worst. However I am very pleased to say that we had a lovely stay and would therefore offer some advice to potential travellers: 1) Start by acknowledging that a 4* Italien hotel (and European in general) is not the same as a 4* Hotel in the Far East for example. Also, I am of the opinion that more people are likely to write a review when returning if they had a very bad experience so bare that in mind - the reviews may not be representative. 2) Generally you get what you pay for - shop around when booking at this hotel, do not pay what you would expect to pay for a 4* in London for example. 3) The cable tv does not work properly - we had no English channels at all in our first room and only CNN in the second but surely you are going to Rome to see the city?? Not sit in a hotel room so we found this acceptable as background noise in the morning. 4) The hotel is not in the nicest of areas - it is down the backstreets. Possibly why room rate can be foudn so cheaply. However it really is within 10 minutes walk of the Vatican and there are many restaurants and ice cream parlours within walking distance. The best meal we had was at a family run restaurant near the hotel. 5) The metro is cheao however we found the best way to see the city was to get a 48hr ticket for the green \"Rome Open Top Bus\". This picks up at the Vatican and proved a convenient method of seeing the city, getting back to the hotel and airport. 6) Breakfast - not great. Eggs and bacon were scrummy. There is cereal and bread but rather limited. But it did the trick. More room for pizza fro lunch! 7) Hotel staff - the porter was very unfriendly but the reception staff were most helpful, particularly when the shutter on our door broke and when we requested to move rooms. The bar area is nice to relax in and the barman accommodating. 8) In line with other reviews - it was very noisy in the morning - the housekeeping staff made so much noise they might aswell have been in the room with us however at least it made us get out of bed early to see the sights! Overall I would say I enjoyed my stay at the Nova Domus BUT GO WITH REALISTIC EXPECTATIONS. If you want \"proper\" 4 or 5* luxury they are much nicer hotels in the more central areas of the city. However for what we were looking for it was perfectly adequate given the cheap rate. If you have already booked when reading these reviews like I had, DO NOT PANIC. A side note not connected to the hotel - avoid the restaurant opposite the Colloseum which is in guidebooks. After making us wait 40 minutes for 2 pizzas as the waited had forgotten to submit the order TWICE, and with no apology, they then tryed to overcharge us by 20 Euros. I questioned the waiter at which point (in front of ym very eyes) he edited the bill but still overcharge us on the drinks. It does not cost \u00a38 for Coke even opposite the Colloseum. I had to ask a waitress for the correct price at which point I confronted the waiter to say it wasn't the first price, or the second but in actual fact it was the price I had worked our.

The sheets, towels and bathroom were clean, the wardrobe and walls, curtains and windows were filthy. I didn't dare touch the air con for fear of electrocution. The TV was 20 years old with two fuzzy channels (italian and CNN). The toilet wasn't fixed to the floor properly so wobbled when sat on.

The door jams on both our rooms were very loose or broken. Later that night, my brother had informed the front desk of this situation and the Porter assured them that it was not a problem and the rooms cannot be broken in to. The next morning I looked closer at my door and lock and took my grocery club card and opened the door in less than five seconds, and did the same to my brothers room. I went down to the front desk and asked if we could switch rooms, we checked the doors on those rooms and they had the same problem. In fact the porter had me check the doors first with my grocery card first and I was able to open five more rooms. We finally found one room that we could not open with the card. Then we returned later that night and our luggage was still left in the other rooms. The next night we went out to dinner, gone a few hours and our room was broken in to. Our luggage had been taken out of the closet and gone through. They had stolen any electronic device that was out or put away in luggage. ie, digital camera that couldn't fit in thier shoebox size safe, and a cell phone. Fortunately everything else was in the safe and we had the key with us. The Carbanieri was called and during the investigation they found that they were able to enter the room with just the \"Do Not Disturb\" paper sign. He folded it in half and was in the room in less than ten seconds. We were asked to go to the Carbaneries' station the next day to complete a report a report but they \"didn't speak english\" and didn't understand. Well they were able to say that with clarity in english!!! In the end the Hotel did comp our stay but did not equate to the loss that we incurred.

We liked being in a quiet residential area, and there were plenty of shops and cafes within a short walk. There was even a McDonalds about 20-30 minute walk away. It was very pleasant strolling along to it one evening, but don't ask for a quarter pounder, they don't seem to have them in italy- either that or our garbled italian just made no sense!

Just serves us right for not using the complimentary map supplied by the hotel. We used most of the cafes in the area and, with the exception of one (can't remember the name) the service was great and the prices reasonable; all the staff were polite and most spoke some english. When we originally considered visiting Rome, we looked at hotels in the city centre, around the Spanish Steps and Trevi fountain. Having now been, we are so glad that we chose to stay at the Nova Domus as it was so peaceful. I think the city centre area would have been too noisy at night. So if your looking for a quiet hotel that's reasonably close to the sights, we would recommend the Hotel Nova Domus, so much so that we have booked for next july already.", "Date": "September 2, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "burnaby bc", "Title": "\u201cNova Domus - Well below expectations\u201d", "Author": "lbruno", "ReviewID": "UR5611974", "Content": "My past travel experience in Europe has enlightened me to the limitations of the hotel star rating system so it was important to me to find a hotel that is affiliated with a brand name I had personally experienced. Early this year we stayed at a Quality Inn hotel in Canada (Kamloops, BC) and we had a pleasant experience. Based on this experience, I decided to booked four days at the Nova Domus hotel, a \"four star\" hotel, while in Rome during the last week of July. The hotel advertised it offered parking so I assumed it had a reasonable parking facility. My assumption was incorrect. There were no parking stalls so I had to leave my car keys with the hotel reception so they could park the car in there \"lot\". Moving in and out of the parking lot was too convoluted so I did not bother using my car during my stay. The room we were given was of poor quality. The carpets were dirty, the showerhead holder was broken, the ceiling had a large water stain, and the TV remote control was broken with a missing part. The shelf in the bathroom sagged and it looked as if it would fall. One of the beds fell apart and when a piece came off we could see the duct tape that was used to hold it in place before it came off. I asked the hotel to give me another room but they refused my request. I was promised the showerhead would be fixed right away but it took two days to repair. The cleaning staff was friendly but the reception staff was not very helpful. They did what had to be done and they did not extend themselves in any way. Other less significant irritants should be noted but I will skip over these expect for one more item. Walking outside the hotel along the connecting sidewalk, we had to be careful to avoid the numerous piles of dog excrement. Apparently, the hotel did not consider it important to maintain its surrounding perimeter. I decided to stay and live with the above-mentioned deficiencies because I had prepaid my booking and changing hotels would involve another inconvenience I did not wish to inflict on my three children. I do not recommend this hotel and I encourage you to find another facility. Rome is a beautiful place to visit. I will go back to Rome some day soon but this time I will be a little more careful about the hotel I select.", "Date": "August 14, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ruthin, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cDon't rely on the staff - for anything!!\u201d", "Author": "Ddraig", "ReviewID": "UR5510902", "Content": "My wife and I made our first vist to Rome for our wedding anniversary - so expectations were high. The hotel is, contrary to some reviews, very near the Vatican and linked sites, and is close to 2 Metro stations which connect you to all the other sites within minutes - so location is fine. Our first impression of the hotel was that it was well appointed - but clearly they didn't think we warranted their best standards - one side of the 4th floor corridor has plush, well appointed rooms, but ours looked not to have been touched for 20 years - it was ok - just very tatty - a door made of formica, very poor tv. no tea making facilities, shower leaked over the bathroom floor and the toilet seat broke (being cheap plastic and very old) and was not replaced during our stay. The restaurant was quite expensive and the food not of the freshest - all bread, bread sticks and even wafers in ice cream were stale and breakfast fruit juice was so watered down you couldnt tell what it was. Most annoying about the restaurant is that in 2 non-breakfast uses of it they brought the wrong order both times! I know my Italian isnt great - but I did point at the menu listings too! Staff were all polite and this made a good first impression, but only until you had an issue. For instance, the only way to get any drinks was from the bar, or from the mini-bar. And as it was close to 100 degrees (upper thirties) getting water, when there are no shops within walking distance, was a major issue. There are no drink machines at the hotel. The bar tender was a nice guy, but the first time I went to the bar to ask for a couple of cokes he asked me to come back in 20 minutes because he was too busy stocking the shelves to serve me! Then all of the drinks were warm for the whole evening - beer, coke, wine, water - everything. A gentle comment about this got a shrug. However, the main thing that would stop us ever going to or recommending this hotel were the arrangements we made to get to the airport. 24 hours before our flight we asked reception how they recommended we make the transfer - they advised a taxi and said they would book it. The next morning before breakfast (due to leave at 8.30am) we checked and reception told us the taxi had been booked. We were in reception in plenty of time. As we waited another group came down and asked for a taxi to be ordered for the airport. A taxi arrived at 8.30 and we put our bags in only to be shooed away by the receptionist very crossly. Apparently the group who had been waiting 4 minutes were due this taxi - ours had not turned up. The attitude of the hotel changed at this point - we reminded them that they had booked our taxi and that we were about to miss our plane - they told us it was not their problem if a taxi didnt turn up, and we could not expect to take someone elses taxi (from the same firm by the way). We asked them to reorder a taxi which I don't believe they did - so in the end we had to resort to the street corner to try to flag a cab down.

We had a room on the 2nd floor. The room opened out onto a terrace which is accessible by anyone on the floor. Some renovation work was going on so there was scaffolding set up outside one of the windows and the window shade could not be lowered in front of the door. We had a room with a sitting room that had two pull out twin beds from the couches, a short hallway which the bathroom was located off of, and then a 2nd room with two twin beds pushed together. The pull out couch was comfortable, although I was suspicious at first because the end of the bed sagged a bit. Bathroom was spacious, although there were no hooks to hang any towels/clothes. The tub leaked a bit, but wasn't that much of a problem (yet....perhaps for future residents of that room it will be). The walls that border the hallway are very thin and through the night could hear people returning to their rooms and slamming doors. The restaurant in the hotel is very good and we ate dinner here one night. Prices are very reasonable and they do not charge the \"cover charge\" that many restaurants in Italy apply to your bill. Breakfasts were also very good. There is an outdoor terrace that you could eat on in nice weather. Front desk staff were very helpful in answering questions and giving directions. Keys to your room have to be turned in and put on a board behind the desk before you leave. Don't take your keys out with you as the keyfob has both the hotel name and your room number on them and so if they are stolen, some not so nice person could have easy access to your room. We had an unfortunate situation when checking out in that someone charged a dinner for two from the restaurant to our room. However, the man at the desk let us go without much to-do as he saw that we were three and not two. Also we had been at a tour dinner the night before so there was no way we could have also been in the restaurant. The hotel is located in a residential neighborhood so there are a few restaurants/pizzerias within walking distance, but it really isn't a location for prime shopping. One block down there is a market that is open every day selling all sorts of fresh fruit. When it comes to sightseeing around Rome, this hotel is not located in a prime spot. The closest sight is the Vatican & St. Peter's Square which is still a good 10-15 minute walk and includes a climb up some stairs. Even the train station is a good walk away. Others in our group took about 30 minutes to walk over to the Trevi Fountain.

We were allocated to room 110 on the 1st floor. Firstly the twin room was a single plus sofa bed, not two beds, however the sofa bed was comfortable so I won't complain too much! The problem came in the morning when the breakfast rush of tour groups came through at 6.45am in the morning and woke us (and possibly the rest of the floor?) on the way through to the restaurant at the end of the hall. There was a tour group of 100 very excitable and very loud Mexican tourists staying for 10 days, so I feel for those sleeping along the hallway from 1st - 11th January in our hallway! We also had a problem with our bathroom; whenever we had a shower the bathroom would flood, resulting in wet towels/feet/socks... in the bathroom every morning!! On a positive note, breakfast was great (there was plenty left after the tour groups had departed) and the location is good for the Vatican. The location is not as convenient for the Ancient City and other tourist sights, where walking is a fair hike so the metro, a 7 - 8 minute walk from the hotel and about 6 - 8 stops to the Spagna meant that you couldn't just 'pop home' half way through the day with shopping or for a rest. When we return to Roma, we'll probably stay in another location, as the city is so great I think you should always go somewhere a little different, and this hotel is a little out of the way. One note: Try and get to the little restaurant near Campo de Fiori - Der Pallaro at Largo da Pallaro 15. It is closed on Monday so we missed out, but will definitely get there next time.

I would avoid this place at all costs.", "Date": "May 5, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "England", "Title": "\u201cA wonderful time in Rome\u201d", "Author": "jakdee", "ReviewID": "UR3430170", "Content": "My partner and I stayed in this hotel for 5 nights. The hotel was clean and tidy and the staff were so polite and helpful all speaking very good english. Our accommodation had 2 rooms, one with a TV and sofa bed the other twin beds and TV. The bathroom had a spa bath which we used twice a day as we walked so much!! We did have a balcony but it overlooked a concrete football pitch where the local children often played football. It does take a good 10 minutes to walk to the Vatican museum and about 20 - 25 minutes to St Peters Square. The walls maybe thin in the hotel rooms or our next door neighbours very thoughtless. I had to complain about next doors television being up too loud - it woke us up at 12.30am. After 2 phone calls the TV was turned down. The menu in the restaurant is not extensive, but it is definately cheaper than eating out as we found out to our cost! The food is good and there is a decent enough choice for breakfast from the buffet selection with a good choice of teas and of course unlimited coffee. Book your taxi to the airport through the hotel, it costs 50 euros - it cost us so much more taking the train to the city then a taxi to the hotel. Don't accept a taxi ride from touts.. you will be ripped off - we were. We will definately stay at this hotel again on our next holiday to Rome. It is definately a 4 star hotel..", "Date": "May 1, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Scotland", "Title": "\u201cDisappointing\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3423609", "Content": "We stayed in a standard double/twin room. The room had grubby decor and was in very poor condition for four star. The en-suite was very small and dirty with mould growing everywhere in the shower. The plumbing didn't work well, the cold tap gave only a dribble and there was a drain in the floor that gurgled every time we ran water. We couldn't use the shower for more than 3-4 minutes as the drain was slow and it would have overflowed. Despite complaing all we got was a shrug of shoulders and a sudden inability to speak english. The only saving grace was the food which was passable, although again not what we expected from four star. There may be better rooms but don't take 326 unless it has been upgraded. There was no air conditioning despite being told there was.", "Date": "April 29, 2005"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Quality Hotel Nova Domus", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187791-d202580-Reviews-Quality_Hotel_Nova_Domus-Rome_Lazio.html", "Price": "$91 - $230*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Via G.
