Actually despite my late hour of arrving (nearly midnight) the friendly receptionist arranged a room nearby in this hotel Charter. The rooms are somewhat older and could use a renovation and they are not so clean (I'm not really fond of the bedspread) but not dirty either. Sheets and floor where clean and the bathroom was clean and had everything in working order. If you consider the price compared to average hotels in Rome it's quite some value for money and the location is not bad either because you're near the Termini station and not quite far from the top tourist destinations. the staff is friendly and I would recommend this hotel to young/budget and single travellers staying for a short trip. A comment on the neighborhood...when arriving after 11pm I kind of thought it to be a bad neighborhood. Actually seeing it during day time and earlier in the evening the streets around the hotel are quite busy and lively with restaurants and tourist shops (also two supermarkets nearby) so not more unsafe then the rest of Rome. Be aware of pick pockets and some undesired solicitors (do not accept anything offered for free like wrist bands, but that's common sense and you'll find these people anywhere tourist are nowadays)", "Date": "September 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "albuquerque", "Title": "\u201cgood location\u201d", "Author": "princess_on_the_road", "ReviewID": "UR113201335", "Content": "In general this hotel reflects the reviews that I\u2019ve looked into before booking my stay. However, one disappointment was that the AC was not turned on yet (I guess they follow the calendar summer). May is not a very hot month, but our room faced the street which is very noisy at 5AM with garbage/delivery trucks. We tried to close the window, but then there was no oxygen in the room. All the other features (that I based my choice on) worked out good. Location was great: very close to train station and public transport to visit all the touristy sites (we got a pass to use all the buses/trams/subway). I guess one can walk to a lot of sites, but we are not that young anymore. The area and the 24-hour reception really made us feel safe, even though it is not a touristy zone. There was a small supermarket around the corner and a big one 3 blocks away. Internet point is a half block away. There were a variety of restaurants, nothing spectacular, but much cheaper that at all the central/touristy places. The room itself was bigger than I expected after reading the reviews (enough space for two people in a double room): big armoire (a lot of hangers), two nightstands, even a writing desk w/chair. The TV was mounted on the wall, (so it was out of the way); it had a few channels on different languages, but we usually do not watch TV when we travel. I would say there is enough space to put a mini fridge and a coffee maker (MY SUGGESTION TO THE HOTEL) since there is no breakfast. The bathroom is adequate, nice showerhead and shampoo/soap provided. The shower is small compared to US standards, but I did not mind that too much. Linens/towels get changed every 3 days. The mattress felt too hard after a while. The staff was friendly, most could speak Basic English and one can leave the luggage at reception after check out if needed. There are no stairs, but a slow lift will go up/down one floor while you have to hold the button (I got irritated by that button a few times). The rate felt expensive for me (more than I paid for a best western in Los Angeles), but I guess that\u2019s Rome for you. I would say it can be a good stop for a night or two, but not for a vacation stay unless you used to Spartan lifestyle (or a much cheaper rate). As a final note, compared to a very similar 2-star hotel in Seville (also central location), the Charter would lose (due to no AC, hard bed, and small shower).", "Date": "June 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Alba Iulia, Romania", "Title": "\u201cgood\u201d", "Author": "banca80", "ReviewID": "UR105640525", "Content": "The hotel has a great location, 2 minutes from the Termini station and it is well seen. It is very small, but comfortable for the travel. First night was a nightmare because we had a room with a street view and we heard all the buses and cars on the road. But the owner asked the next day if we want something different and we changed rooms with an interior one. So, if you have room 50 is great, if it is 44 is noisy like hell. It was clean, every day they cleaned it. The elevator was strange but workable, like a big box-so if you suffer from claustrophobia it could be difficult.

The bathrooms were newly remodeled, the room was clean and comfortable, and had those small touches that made it feel incredibly luxurious. Close to the station, quiet, clean, and a friendly and helpful staff. It had a very good bed which is something that I think too many hotels overlook. The candies in the room were a nice touch. 45 Euros was more than I wanted to spend, but after a night here, I think it was well worth it so thanks for the little discount guys! Only one thing I would love to see would be some free coffee or tea either in the lobby or the rooms, add some fresh pastries and I'm sure you will be a 3 star hotel in no time at all.
