We chose the hotel for its value and reviews we had read online. We were quite pleased. Overall, we had three rooms among our family, and each was quite different. Keep that in mind when you're reading reviews. One might have a shower/tub & a balcony, while another might have a tiny shower and smaller windows. Despite the differences in room quality, we paid the same price for each double occupancy room. Also, double occupancy might mean that two twin beds are pushed together, which can be awkwardly uncomfortable, but workable. The front desk staff was wonderful! They were welcoming at check-in, made sure each of our requests was met, and were really knowledgeable when we asked questions about the area. The vaporetto station is directly across the street, so Venice & the surrounding islands were all very accessible. The hotel did tell us that they have a private boat that runs to Venice & Murano every morning, and I believe they said it was complimentary (check on that, though). We found the vaporetto to be best for our needs. Caution: The vaporetto stop running around midnight, so plan accordingly. We loved our evenings on the island. Being from Southern California, it reminded us of Catalina Island. It's a bit quiet and quite lovely. The food and limited shopping are very touristy. The bike rentals looked really fun! Mid-May was too cold for the beach, but we did walk to the other side of the island to check it out. Nice walk, and it's probably a great spot in the summer. The best part of the hotel was the breakfast! An amazing spread of pastries, cheeses, cereals, fruits, juices & coffee were set out for the guests every morning in a large sunroom with a view out to the street and the water. Just wonderful. :-) If you're being a bit budget-conscious on your trip to Venice, this is a good option.", "Date": "February 16, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Australia", "Title": "\u201cVery Nice\u201d", "Author": "kitwalker_devil", "ReviewID": "UR122390695", "Content": "We had a 4 day stay in Italy and I stayed at this hotel based on a friends recommendation.

The only complaint i would have is that I was waiting for my friend to take a shower so we could join everyone else for breakfast.

Pros: \"Beautiful location\" - right infront of the vaporetto pier, at the corner of the main and most beautifl street in Lido with many eateries and pleasant shops. It was such a change from the crowds of main venice to see the people calmly sipping coffee and kids playing around. Very peaceful. Also did not get chance to use the sun deck/patio on terrace at top floor (EUR 10 / chair) \"Great Buffet Breakfast\" - Choices of bakery items, yougurts, fruits, cereals and what not! Its a feast! \"Nice decor\" - Nice touch of victorian era, furniture and chandeliers. Cons; \"Rooms and baths very small\" - for the price, quite small. Bed was also small and a bit hard. \"bit Pricey\" - as mentioned earlier, but bear in mind that Venice is very expensive and this rate might be justified but the rate certainly not for backpackers.

We were both very tired during our whole time in venice. I would also agree with other comments that the air con was very loud. When we went to check in we were told our room wasn't ready and to come back in an hour. We were slightly annoyed as we only had 48 precious hours in venice but we decided to go get some lunch down the street. We came back in an hour and were told that our room still wasn't ready. If I hadn't kicked up a fuss the concierge wouldn't have rang to check and wouldn't have realised that he was looking at the wrong reservation and the wrong room number...so we wasted an hour sitting around for no reason. There were two people behind the reception desk yet they were only booking one person in at a time...something I thought was very odd and unneccessary. We were also so that our room had a sea view.... when we openend our window you could see the view if you stodd on tip toe and tilted your head. The church bells ringing at 8:15am every morning didn't improve our mood either. If it wasn't for the great breakfast (even if it was a bit weird that they served chocolate swiss roll at breakfast) and the location right next to the vaparetto stop I think I would have tried to find a different hotel.

We also had no issues with staying on the Lido instead of in Venice. The water bus service is outstanding and runs 24x7 so you really are connected just about anywhere in the Venice area including on the Lido. The hotel is also located directly across from the water bus station which makes it very very easy to travel back and forth from Venice. The hotel staff was very friendly, professional and helpful. The rooms are large and clean. For the most part, our only issues were the normal Europe hotel issues - small bathrooms and showers, small elevator, etc but, also I am not sure you could buy a smaller TV for a hotel room then they have here, not that we did much TV time so really not a big issue but wow that was a small one. Oh and Wi-Fi while it was at the hotel for use it came with a fee and didn't work in our rooms. Since we run a business back in the US that requires us to stay connected online this did create a few problems and added costs. There was one other issue, others had mentioned that the hotel had a space at the beach for use in the private beach area. We asked the hotel desk about it and they get a coupon to use, they gave us directions to the location and we packed up and walked down to the beach excited about a day at the beach, but when we got there we learned it was closed for the winter, so we rolled with it and just did the public beach, but since we didn't have towels, umbrella, drinks, etc (which was all part of the private beach deal) it just wasn't the same. When we returned to the hotel and let them know it was closed they seemed surprised. Just be aware that if you plan a beach day be sure the private beach area is even open.

The hotel itself is nice with friendly service and spacious rooms by European standards. High ceilings and the bed was two twins pushed together but we encountered that several times in different locations.There are shutters on the windows that make it literally pitch black inside the room, which is great if you are jet lagged. There is a lovely sun terrace that you can use, great for grabbing a bottle of wine and sitting out to watch the world go by.

The pluses far out way this little negative, as the hotel is clean, tidy and the Lido offers some reasonably priced restaurants and bars near by.

So, we returned to Venice this year with our friends and took along another couple for good measure. We had been impressed with the Riviera last year for a number of reasons (overall quality - location - the view across the lagoon of the Venice skyline - from our balcony, watching cruise liners as they eased through the lagoon approaching and leaving Venice), so we suggested staying there again this year. Though our friends were happy to take at face value what we said about the Riviera, we were nevertheless a little anxious that we might have oversold the hotel and that they (almost inevitably) would be disappointed. We hadn't - and they weren't. We had three adjacent double rooms on the first floor each with its own terrace (that we had noticed last year) and after a hard hot day tramping around Venice or the Lido, it was a decadent pleasure to be able to sit out on our terrace and watch the sun set over Venice. Gin and tonic or Campari and tonic within easy reach. Natch. (Personally I prefer the Lido to Venice itself. Sacrelige, I know!) What else is there to say! This is the best three star hotel I have ever stayed in and I can't imagine why it's classified as \"only\" three star. Breakfast is good and as substantial as you want. I should make clear that we never had an evening meal at the hotel, preferring to seek out a new restaurant to dine at each evening during our 10-day stay. Getting to Venice by water bus is a doddle (and an added pleasure), as the water bus landing stage is just across the street from the hotel. (It's a minor irritation that a new landing stage is being built just opposite the hotel but that's not the hotel's fault - and it doesn't block the view of the Venice skyline. Perhaps if the well appointed and maintained bedrooms were bigger or the TV larger (never had it on) the hotel might aspire to four star status. For what it's worth, in my opinion this is a four star hotel masquerading as a three star hotel. If you don't want to stay in Venice itself but instead want to feel a lagoon breeze on your face while getting to and from Venice then stay on The Lido - at the Riviera. One final pointer for culture vultures and beach lovers. As I've said, it's easy to get to and from Venice by water bus - but a short walk from the hotel also takes you to the shores of the Adriatic. The hotel \"owns\" two sunbeds with parasols on the private beach and these are available to guests at no charge.

Add to this the views stretching across the lagoon from one of the nicest rooms we've stayed in, and the Riviera was a highlight of our trip. To be fair, we were extremely lucky with the price and the room. I managed to fluke a deal through the hotel's website for a lagoon view room for two nights for 65 euros per night - this in September, when most places were charging well into the hundreds of euros for a similar thing - and put in a request with my booking for a balcony (I thought it was worth a try!). To our delight, we were given a corner \"junior suite\" (as it was described on the back of the door), with French doors opening to a wraparound balcony and views across the water to San Marco. Couldn't have been better. The furnishings were comfortable and old-fashioned in a good way; we even had an overstuffed armchair that caught the sun and which I would have loved to have stashed into my suitcase and lugged home. The bed was a little on the firm side, but not enough to make sleeping an issue. The busy intersection outside didn't bother us either. We spent a lot of time on the balcony, watching the cruise ships and people and buses and smaller boats come and go. The bathroom was large and clean, with a shower over a bath - the only thing was that there was no shower curtain or screen so, despite our best efforts to prevent it, water tended to flood the floor in front of the basin. Always mopped up and dry when we returned to the room after sightseeing, though. Breakfast was plentiful and served on classic crockery, complete with the hotel logo on it (silly I know, but I'm a sucker for this kind of thing). There were pleasant places to sit if we had wanted to do so, but we had such a great room that we stayed in it whenever we were at the hotel. Public areas were generally a little florid in their decoration, but that's what we liked about the place - at times we felt like we'd stepped into a 1950s film set, it had such a sense of nostalgia about it. There have been some comments about the unfriendliness of staff and I have to admit that we had a mixed bag there. The Sunday/Monday receptionist was kind and helpful - we couldn't fault him - as were the breakfast ladies; the Tuesday morning receptionist was, well, rude and arrogant. No other words for him, really. But that didn't ruin our stay. We've been to Venice numerous times but had never stayed on the Lido before and we found that we enjoyed the location. It wouldn't be for everyone, what with the trek out and back on the vaporetto to the main sights, but it suited us as being a change from our usual Dorsoduro/San Polo routine. As someone else has said, the hop across the lagoon provided a leisurely start and end to the day, time to enjoy the cool breeze and collect our thoughts. We live in deeply rural surroundings, so a trip on a boat is a welcome diversion! If I were a first-time visitor to Venice, I would probably rather stay closer in, but for repeat travellers, it makes for a pleasant enough change. The only thing I would say is that dining options on the Lido are pretty ordinary, with run-of-the-mill places serving even more uninspiring and overpriced food than we've usually found in Venice (which is saying something). We caught a bus way down to the southern end of the island and there seemed to be some better options there - most of them shut on a Monday night, as we discovered when we tried to head back there for dinner the next day. Not really an issue though - we just jumped on to a vaporetto and headed back into central Venice to eat. I can understand that the Riviera is not everyone's type of hotel and that others have had less than desirable stays there; I imagine that a lot hinges on the room that you get and the price that you pay (and we certainly hit the jackpot on both counts).

The sign is easy to miss as it is not large. Like many hotels in Venice (it seems) it is looking a little faded. We booked a room with a lagoon view and a balcony (they ignored the request for the rate offered by the conference we were attending, on booking, on arrival and the next day, with differing excuses). The room (20) was large (so was the furniture - I could not reach the hanging rack in the wardrobe) and the view spectacular. The bathroom had a window and a bath! The balcony was quite small but the french doors enabled you to sit and enjoy the view. It was very hot and sticky so we were glad of the A\\C at night. So far so good. The breakfast was the usual, meats, boiled eggs etc. but the plastic cups for the watery juice were a bit tacky and the coffee was not great. We used the internet but thought that 6 euros an hour was a bit steep.On the morning of the 5th day we reported that the toilet was not working properly. When we returned several hours later it was still not right and eventually their plumber decided it was broken and removed it so we had to change rooms. No help was offered and the second room (39) was much smaller. It still had the view but only if you stood right at the window and there was no balcony. There were rugs on the floor which slid whenever you stepped on them (we rolled them up before one of us fell) and there was an 8 inch step up into the tiny bathroom (no window and a very small shower). The TV was high up in the corner and you could only see it comfortably if you were lying on the bed. Even taking the humidity into account we thought the sheets felt damp. When we asked for a discount for the last night their English suddenly desserted them (as, by then , we expected) and they thought we should just be glad they had a room to give us (we didn\"t remove the toilet!!!). All in all this was the worst of the 3 hotels we have stopped in at the Lido and at 240euros a night it was the most expensive.

If you want a lie in.... Do not stay here. At 9 in the morning they are shouting, banging, and trying to get into your room while you are still in bed and the key is in the door! And if they realise you are still in your room, it becomes more noisy so that you'll get up. They clean your room every day, so it was something that I found very annoying after five nights.

We wanted a hotel which had easy access to the city but which provided a break from the hustle and bustle. From the moment we entered the Riviera we knew we had made the right choice. Straight across the road from the vaporetto stop yet very little noise got through the well fitting windows. The rooms were not the largest we have had but were very well thought out and had all the required elements. They were spotlessly clean on arrival and attended to each day with fresh towels in the shower-room. Breakfast was the standard european breakfast but with individual pots of fresh coffee delivered with a cheery \"Buongiorno!\" Access to the city was just so easy with a 15 minute ride across to St Mark's Square; so easy that we went back for an evening to sample Venice by night which gave us a completely different perspective on the city. There are several good value restaurants within 200 yards of the Riviera - our favourite was opposite the petrol station - which seems an odd choice of location - where we could sit outside and watch the sun set over the city and see pleasure boats being refueled from a standard petrol pump with the longest hoses we've seen! Hot chocolate to finish the meal was an interesting change from coffee and gave our waiter a good laugh. On our check out morning we had to catch the Alilaguna ferry back to the airport at 7:41 and breakfast did not start until 7:30, no problem - there was a packed snack bag with fruit juice, fruit, croissants, cheese and biscuits ready for each couple as we sorted ou the bill! The reception staff were always very helpful and didn't mind our attempts at Italian even when it came out as Spanish!

Breakfast was good, hard boiled egges, coldcuts and various breads and cereals. The cappuccino was fantastic! The only thing to keep in mind is that to get to St. Marks (the main island where the gondolas and major shops are) it takes about 30-40 minutes by water taxi so make sure to leave yourselves plenty of time. We took a gondola ride at 100euro which seemed a bit expensive but was well worth the money. We went around 7pm (right before the price goes up) and it was fantastic.

Like most of Venice this establishment caters mainly for the older person of an American/British persuasion rather than an Italian guest and as a result it is slightly old fashioned and faux traditional. Breakfast is served in an eating area with table service for coffee and tea. The food itself is buffet and is soft cheese, salami and ham with bread and croissants and yoghurt and fruit. The main disappointment was the orange juice, which appeared to be made from squash and was certainly not fresh. The room I stayed in was very small as was the bathroom but it was very clean and was always made up even if we slept through their first attempt to get in. We paid extra for the lagoon view which isn't really worth the money unless you can get a balcony as you'll tend to keep the shutters closed to keep out the heat anyway. Unless you plan to spend time in your room working or watching TV there is nothing here to complain about. Being on Lido has definite advantages: you are close to the beach, the tourist population is significantly lower than in Venice proper and food and drink is also cheaper. You are dependant on vaporetto to get to the main island which is about 10 minutes to St. Mark's, at least double that to get to the Rialto. Water buses run regularly in the day and (less often) throughout the night, a water taxi is ~\u00e2\u201a\u00ac50 from St. Mark's. Reception and service is of a high standard. Very polite and helpful, arranging for a shirt and suit to be pressed at very short notice and good recommendations for cafes and restaurants.
