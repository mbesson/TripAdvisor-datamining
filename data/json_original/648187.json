We were on a budget so a high class hotel was out of the question. We found Hotel \"Elegant\" online. So we looked at the pictures online and thought it would be a decent place. We knew we wouldnt get something gorgeous but at least something sleepable... Anyways to make a long story short, we arrived the woman at the front desk was not plesent there was this old man always walking around looking and inspecting everything all the time.. The place smelt like old wet carpets. The beds were hard like a rock, The room was extremely HOT even with the window open. The servide was terrible down stairs. The vending machine was empty and not refilled through the whole 4 days we stayed here.. There was VERY loud people next door to the point where they bang on the wall cuz they were wrestling and my head actually bounced off the wall. I think they let anyone in the building.. And the location where the hotel is, its very scarey.. It look like a dump from outside.. The Pictures online that they have dont even match what the have in the rooms. The only thing that is actuallyi n the room that you see online is the blanket.. And that feels like plastic..", "Date": "March 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cGreat value!

Its close to all the clubs like 6 or 7 blocks and a 20 min walk to Vieux Montreal (Old Montreal) Coras is the Ihop of canada and its like 5 blocks away. Rue Ontario has alof of the straight bars and a few good places to eat too which is a block away. The room is standard. queen size bed, fridge which was nice, and a clean bathroom. The from desk staff isn't all that nice or friendly but if you ask them questions they will answer anything you need. For 5 days 4 nights we paid a little over 300 and i think thats a deal ... If you don't want to park on the street for whatever reason ( people on here are way to scared of things... i live in new and its the same thing has parking here. ) ITs actually pretty safe and thats including walking back to the hotel at 3am slightly buzzed... but if you are still scared someone is going to do something to your car (not going to happen) accross the street is a parking lot daily is 20$ and around the corner there is one also didn't park there ... after the first day i parked on the street and actually avoided paying for parking most of the time.

There is Cora's Breakfast within 1,5 kms (20 minute walk) from the hotel. Wi-Fi too slow? Unless you are on YouTube or download movies, you'll find Internet connection pretty reasonable Parking lot is too far? I paid $21 and could drive in and out for 3 days without paying extra. It was only 5 minutes away from the hotel. Lazy to walk? Park across the street but the rates won't be as flexible. My gf and I stayed in room 311, which faced townhomes and was fairly quiet. Nothing outrageous during our 3 day 2 night stay. There wasn't much space for luggage. This room is suitable for those with minimum luggage: we travelled with 1 gym bag, 1 back pack and a small suit case and everything fit right by our bed. I am not gonna bother commenting on panhandlers and such. This is downtown Montreal. Enough said. Tip #1: if your room is too cold or too hot, try playing with the duct on the ceiling.

The hotel mangeger was not avaliable and we were asked to come back the following day to ask for the refund of our money, since we didn't stay in this room for more than 10 min in total!! The next morning he refused to talk to us in reasonable way. And screened and pointed his finger at us and we would waste his time. We didn't get our money back!! We would also like to mention that we have a lot of travel experience and therefore do have realistic views on accomodation also in this price segment.

Firstly, when we arrived we found that you have to buzz to get into the hotel, and were subsequently locked outside in the cold for over twenty minutes. The excuse for this was that the receptionist couldn't hear us buzzing, knocking, calling or yelling. Then there were Hotel Elegant's rules; which include no visitors after 10 pm, no alcohol, and no outside food. This place is more like your mother-in-law's than a hotel. The rooms themselves are even worse. There are stains literally everywhere, and in four days of stay our sheets and towels were never changed once. And the free highspeed wireless internet they advertise? It requires an ethernet cord. Don't bother waking up for the continental breakfast either. It's quite literally canned orange juice, muffins from the grocery, and cheap tea. All of which, is quite obviously bought weeks in advance and tastes incredibly stale. The staff is what tops this place off. They all act extremely snobbish and turn any small complaint you make into a lecture on how you should be glad the hotel is so cheap. (And by the way, their prices fluctuate on how much they want to extort you, as we discovered when a friend came to get a room for the night and got the exact same room we booked for twenty dollars less) Lastly, and this really takes the cake, on our last night's stay we found a pair of dirty, red boxershorts underneath one of our beds.
