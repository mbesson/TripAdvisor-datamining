As a property for the business traveler I highly recommend this hotel. The rooms are large and comfortable, the staff is attentive, and the location is very good. Why don't I recommend it for a family vacation? The hotel is relatively expensive, the meals even more so, and all the various services in the hotel are priced for the business traveler on expense account rather than the family on vacation.

Since then the maintenance has being neglected resulting in what it is today. This is even more evident if you know their sister property. However having said so, it is important to know that renovation programs are planed (some has being finished already) in the near future to bring the hotel back on track. The guest rooms are of very good size, (however are also in urgent need to be renovated in respect to their decoration and furniture) and offer a good value for their room rates. The bath room is well equipped and offers very good amenities; housekeeping did work well and always timely. The room-service was fast and the products served were of good quality and hot.We had our meals in both restaurants one of which (the restaurant on the ground floor) operates only during day time and closes early evening, the other (located on the first floor) is operating also at night time. In both cases the FB served was of good quality, the Employees were friendly and helpful at all times and managed their duty well and efficient.Their Lobby bar is part of the refurbishment presently in progress, the service and evening life entertainment is good, prices are fine for the standard and once the refurbishment is finished will be a very nice place to meet and enjoy a drink.Their banquet facilities are very well designed, with all the amenities needed to offer a great service for small to large functions of all kind. The area also offers quite nice areas for break up and meal services during the functions.Front desk check in/out was fast and efficient, bell boy service was well trained and for sure very helpful and ready to go the extra mile even at night time. The rates for the hotel operated limousine service are well priced and I would strongly recommend using this service at all times.We both had Spa service, one was perfectly executed keeping up with all standards of a Leading Spa of the World, and the one I took however fail in all aspects. In respect to the Spa operation itself I was not impressed and the price value at present is way out of line, keeping the present Operating Standards, Decoration and Guest Services as well as Spa Amenities in mind.Once the renovation and refurbishment is finished I am sure this Grand Lady will once again shine.", "Date": "Feb 26, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR629668225", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "GlobetroterCostaRica"}, {"Content": "Loved the experience, great for meetings!!!

We knew little would be open so hoped to spend the day in the hotel enjoying ourselves, but of course without the gym and other facilities that was a joke.

We asked what we could do on Christmas day, knowing that everything would be closed but looking for someplace to walk. They had literally nothing to offer. Turns out there was a annual celebration in the Zocalo but they didn't tell us. Also, the hotel cars were a scam. THey were very reluctant to order the sitio and the hotel cars literally charged 4x as much. The tour through the hotel was also a joke -- the private car was very expensive and was no better than the minivan tour which cost 1/2 as much.

My wife and I just returned from Mexico and stayed at a spa about 85 miles from Mexico City. Rather than staying an extra day we decided to spend a full day in Mexico City and booked the Marquis Reforma Hotel though Orbitz. When we arrived and checked into our soom which was very small, the hot water would only dribble out. We called the front desk and complained about the problem and were told that they would repair it. In as much as we were going to tour the National Museum for 2-3 hours we told them they would have access to the room. When we returned the water problem had not been repaired. We again called the front desk and they told us the hotel would move us to a different room which turned out to be an even smaller room. In checking out the room we found that the toilet had not been flushed and there was hair in the bathroom sink. The following morning we complained to a young assistant manager who only replied that she hoped that the next time we stayed at the hotel it would be better. Finally, although the concierge was very friendly he had little knowledge of local attractions such as the National Museum of Mexico. He sent us to a supposed 5 star restuarant which was lousy.This hotel is a member of the Leading Hotels of the Wrold which are some of the finest. Dont waste your time or money staying at this place.

The facility is very, very nice, with a great looking lobby, a big bar area, nice restaurant, and comfortable seating areas on the first floor. Everyone in my party got a great room. I never figured out if my room was an upgrade or not, but I did end up in a suite: a living room with a table to spread out my work, and a sizable bedroom with very comfortable bed. The bathroom was roomy, with both shower and bath and free bottled water, a nice touch. I would have to say it was an above-average room in most respects. One negative was some wear and tear noticed on the doors, which lookd like some angry guest spent a lot of time kicking them for good measure. The buffet breakfast in the first floor restaurant, which was included in my room rate, was very good and included some typical (and tasty) Mexican standards (you could probably live for days off of a Mexican breakfast it's that big and that good). The bar area was big had a little trio playing in the evening, and served good snacks and a very good margarita according to my travelling companions. And all of this at reasonable charges, whether talking about the room or the food.I have a mixed review with regards to service unlike everyone else, though: The concierge was excellent, arranging for a car to transport us around the city for two days, Everything was as promised with no muss or fuss, and the driver and SUV we had were excellent. Also, the hotel let me charge both days' worth of driving to my hotel room, obviating the need for extra cash in bulging pockets on that second day. On the other hand, check in was slow and one of the people in my party was given someone else's room (this led to some embarrassment later). The business center was only serviceable and understaffed (only one person there) and later difficulties with the wireless connection took too long to be resolved as the in-house expert was not immediately available. Breakfast service at the restaurant (La Jolla) was listless, with waitstaff disappearing for extended periods. These annoyances keep me from giving this hotel 5 stars. Again, though, I must stress that I would come back to stay and would recommend it to future travelers.", "Date": "Dec 8, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR859733054", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "Warwick Traveler"}, {"Content": "Marquis Reforma--Excellent Service! I stayed at the Marquis Reforma Nov 14-17 2006 while attending a conference at the Banamex Center in Mexico City. This was my first trip to Mexico City. I was traveling alone (female, mid forties, my command of the Spanish language is limited to the vocabulary needed to order drinks in a bar or tell someone to wash their hands.) My goals for this trip were to take care of the business that I was there to do and try to see a little bit of Mexico City, safely.The hotel met all of my needs, I would return in a heartbeat. My room was outfitted beautifully with robes, fluffy duvets (triple sheeted) and a beautiful marble bathroom with a deep soaking tub, makeup mirror and powerful hairdryer  a phone. Lots of amenities inlcuding bath gel; shampoo; conditioner; shaving cream and a razor. Plenty of hangars and a programable safe large enough for my laptop. Large TV with a few english speaking stations.Two bottles of water are provided free each day. Fruit and candy is provided with the turn down service each evening. Mini bar is stocked with everything from cookies, to cognac and condems. (The beer is cheaper then the soda!) The internet connection is wired and connected w/o any problems. The charge was $20 USD per 24 hr period. I requested an iron and an ironing board, I recieved a clothes steamer, but it worked fine for my needs.Most of my transportation was arranged through the hotel. $880 pesos for the airport transfers; $180 pesos each way to the Banamex convention center ($100 to get back arranged at the site); $80 pesos to the museums. Cars were all late models, good condition, excellent drivers, and I was able to add the transportation costs to my hotel bill. I cant say enough about the concerige service --it was simply outstanding.The spa and fitness centers are beautiful and modern. There was a $15 USD charge per day to use the pool/spa area. The fitness center was free. It was in a wonderful atrium setting and outfitted with newer treadmills, stairmasters, ciruit training equipment, flat screen tvs, and plenty of water. Margaritas in the lobby bar were around $100 pesos, and small, but powerful! The restaurant offered excellent food and spectacular service. Breakfast was about $160 pesos for the buffet (the best buy) lots of choices, plenty of juice and coffee. Dinners were around $250 pesos. I often brought a book to read and never felt rushed. Room service offered the same menu and delivery was quick, presentation superb, food was hot.The business center was nicely outfitted with plenty of computers and helpful personnel. The charge was $50 pesos per 15 minutes of computer use. The spanish keyboard slowed me down, but the internet connection was fine.The ATM and the Gift shops are hidden away on the lower floors, ask for them and the concierge will get someone to take you there. You can get beer, snacks, water, chocolate at the gift shop and well, pesos at the ATM.I loved the public areas of the hotel, deep couches and conversation areas and beautiful sculptures and artwork.

This is my first stay at the Marquis Reforma and I will stay here for this entire trip. I travel all over the world on business, including three or four trips a year to Mexico, D.F. While in this compelling city, I have stayed at the W, the JW Marriott, InterContinental, Habita and Hotel Nikko.The Marquis Reforma is, in my opinion, simply the finest hotel in Mexico, D.F. First, please be aware that it is, in all senses, a TRULY Mexican hotel. You will hear much less English here, spoken by the staff, in the lobby, anywhere, really, than you will at the hotels right on the strip in Polanco, such as the JW Marriott. Everything about the hotel is authentic Mexican - the decor, the attitude, the food - everything. So, I guess what I'm saying is that it will take some adjustment for most non-Spanish speakers.All of the above adds up to a TRULY OUTSTANDING place to stay, if you come with an open mind. If you want a massive, impersonal hotel, with plenty of services, go to the Nikko. This hotel is more intimate and much smaller. The level of customer service is far beyond that of other hotels in the city. Every employee of the hotel goes out of their way to make your stay enjoyable. If you need something, you'll get it FAST. Just today, coming back from a meeting, I stopped at a Gigante supermarket for snacks and TONS of water (like 30 litre and a half bottles...hey, I'm here for almost two weeks). No problem - it was all brought straight to my room.The fitness center is beautiful and functional. I would say it is among the top 20 fitness centers of any hotel I have stayed at in the world, and that is saying a LOT as I am a frequent Asia and Europe traveller. The pool is also very nice and quite warm.The food is also very authentic and very good. Room service is lightning-fast, the food is hot and the Mexican dishes (that's all I've tried) are really nice. Breakfast in the hotel's restaurant is perfect - good buffet selection and everything is fresh and tastes good (not the case in most of the Polanco hotels most of the time).They also do the little, important, things well. Laundry and show shine service is prompt and nicely done.The location is fine - personally, I would prefer staying in this hotel but I'd like to move it into the heart of Polanco, rather than have it where it is now on the Paseo de la Reforma.Okay...that sums it up. Just so you know, I'm very hard on hotels. Most of my reviews barely make it to 3 stars.
