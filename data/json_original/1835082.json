If you want this hotel i advice you to reserve a room in high floor so you can avoid the noise & if you close your window you will hear nothing. Otherwise everything is fine & honestly if i have to come again to Istanbul , i will stay in this hotel ,but i will make sure that there is no constructions around.", "Date": "March 24, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wroclaw", "Title": "\u201cOK\u201d", "Author": "Pawel_EPWR", "ReviewID": "UR124625049", "Content": "Extreamly helpful and polite service.

I came in with low expectations but was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the hotel. The front desk and restaurant staff were competent, friendly and accommodating. My room was good sized and well maintained. The safe was of good size as it accommodated my laptop. The air-conditioning never failed. Bathroom amenities and the Turkish towels were superb. I could have taken a pair of towels home if they had some new ones for sale.

The streets in the neighbourhood were very dirty and we were advised not to walk around at night. When complaining about the air conditioning, the management also lied to us on multiple occasions telling us that the air conditioning system was broken when it was not the case, they simply turn it off when they feel like it to save money. On the redeeming side it is relatively close to the Grand Bazar and it is clean.

I have to say it is nothing \"special\" but it is clean and comfortable and really posed no problem. If this hotel is proposed to you as part of deal don't hesitate it really is just fine. Nice sized room, nice large marble bathroom, a lot of renovations have been done, great indoor pool on the rooftop terrace, + sauna and hamam. Very close to the Grand Bazaar but a good 10-15 min walk to the Blue Mosque and St Sophia as well as all the best restaurants so I would have prefered to be closer to the old Istanbul even though this is considered to be in old istanbul and something more intimate.
