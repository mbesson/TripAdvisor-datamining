It would've been almost funny if I weren't so jetlagged. When the guy came to check the toilet, he had an attitude and tried to tell me it was fine-- then proceeded to ram the handle for about 20 minutes until it was worse than before. We had to stay in that room the first night (had to use the bar's toilet), and when we went down in the morning to switch rooms, the people in front of us in line at the desk had been robbed from the 6th floor. Not off to a good start. BUT, we were changed to a much better room for the rest of our vacation. Very comfortable, bigger, everything worked, quieter, and clean. We carried our valuables around with us all week instead of leaving them in the room, but that was probably not necessary. Staff were very personable, breakfast was great (good for vegetarians), and the location can't be beat.

Having stayed at other London hotels of similar cost on previous visits, we found this one to have larger rooms, be more comfortably appointed, and EXTREMELY convenient to most everywhere in London via the Marylebone tube stop (and train station) which is nearly adjacent to the hotel. The hotel is very close to several good restaurants, a couple of pharmacies, some food stores and just a couple of blocks from Baker St. and the Baker St. tube stop. We even included Abbey Rd. studios/crossing in one of our morning 45 minute round trip walks. It's quite close to Regent's Park, a short stroll from the canals and just a pleasant walk to the Wallace Collection Gallery (try their outstanding cafe for a leisurely, splurgey lunch!). We found the food options in the Marylebone station to be a great, cheap alternative for lunches/snacks than more costly, \"sit down\" places. The staff in the hotel were very courteous and friendly and although the hotel bar is really nothing to write home about, one evening we were tired and opted to eat at the hotel rather than going out - fully expecting \"hotel food,\" and were pleasantly shocked to have one of the BEST meals of our whole trip at the Jarvis Marylebone Ramada!

The rooms themselves were small and the decor was a bit worn. The bathroom also looked like it could use a makeover, the tub was chipped as was the tile in various locations.

It was very nice, the location extremely convenient, but there were some issues I think that are worth noting. DECOR/CLEANLINESS: Beautifully decorated lobby, single rooms extremely small but nicely set up, very clean, very good maid service. LOCATION: Very convenient, right next to the subway station, where there are little stores where you can easily find sandwiches, salads, fruit, snacks to help ease the bite of the weak dollar and supplement restaurant meals. CONTINENTAL BREAKFAST: A cut above the rest I think. Offered salami/cheese plate, 3 different breads, 3 different fruits, 3 different yoghurts, cereals, pastries, 3 different juices, coffe/tea and more. Fast, efficient service, newspapers provided, really helped me out by providing a solid first meal of the day. As a vegetarian, I got on very well here. ISSUES: Maintenance: The first room I got, I settled in, used the restroom and then found the toilet was broken and did not flush. I called the desk and they sent housekeeping right up and she summoned maintenance. While I was waiting, I laid down on the bed only to find that on this small single bed, everyone slept on the same side and there was a definite tilt to the mattress. I requested a room change and got one without problem. The second room I got the toilet and mattress were fine so I unpacked and took a shower. The shower did not drain and left 2\" inches of water. Housekeeping came right up and as maintenance had gone for the day by this time, the housekeeping manager proceeded to pump the drain out. The service and response was excellent but these things should not have happened. How could the toilet and shower have been cleaned and someone not have known they didn't work? STAFF: Seem like mostly French speaking foreign students. Very helpful and eager to please. SECURITY: NONEXISTANT! I had several people call me and no one at the front desk picked up. Similarly, I called the front desk several times and noone picked up. I had guests come to the hotel and walk right up to my room unchallenged. One set of guests said they didn't see anyone in the lobby at all. One night I came home, walked through the lobby, up to my room and didn't see a single staff person. While there often staff members present during the week I was here, I frequently encountered a complete lack of security. OVERALL: A nice, clean hotel, with friendly staff, eager to please. However, because of the security issues, I would try another hotel next time. It's a shame -- this is a very convenient and nicely attired place but in a major city in this day and age, the fact that the front desk is left unattended, no matter for how short a time, is perplexing and disturbing.", "Date": "June 9, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cCozy, Convenient, Friendly\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1775449", "Content": "My wife and I were booked into this attractive hotel as part of a Virgin Atlantic Vacations Package.
