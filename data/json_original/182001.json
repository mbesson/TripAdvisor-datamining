The hotel was one of the choices we were given for a wedding we were attending. I chose the BW plus because the price was good & it was closest to the wedding venue. We were able to walk over to the wedding from the hotel. The staff were very friendly & efficient when we checked in. We had no trouble finding the hotel from the directions they had given on their website. The room was clean & the bed was very comfortable. Unfortunately the room was unbearably hot. We arrived late in the afternoon so just had time for a little rest from the drive & then time to get ready for the wedding. The room was so hot it was very difficult getting ready. The bathroom is small so it was a bit of a struggle getting ready due to the size & the heat. I was soaked in sweat while trying to get dressed up. The room did have a window that opened so we opened it up & turned on the cooling system before we left for the wedding. When we returned from the wonderful wedding the room had not cooled down at all. If it hadn't been so late I would have called the front desk. It was next to impossible to sleep. I finally got a couple of hours sleep just out of sheer exhaustion but when I got up the pillow was soaked as was I. That was sleeping with no blankets on us. I ended up having a cool shower to try to cool off. Another couple that we were going to the wedding with had the same issue in their room too. If it wasn't for the heat it would have been a very pleasant stay. My husband & I had the breakfast buffet before we checked out & it was good.The choices were adequate. The fresh fruit was very good as were the croissants. The waitress was also very friendly & efficient. When we went to leave the car was returned to us very quickly. Overall it is a nice hotel for the price especially considering most hotel prices in Toronto. If it wasn't for the heat we would have been extremely satisfied.", "Date": "March 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Niagara Falls Ontario", "Title": "\u201cgreat stay\u201d", "Author": "Locksley9", "ReviewID": "UR125846485", "Content": "We were in Toronto for a theatre excursion and stayed overnight at this property.

The staff that we had brief contact with were friendly. The biggest drawback to this hotel are the extra charges, which aren't very well advertised on its website. First and foremost, the only hotel parking is valet parking, and costs $14 plus tax, so nearly $16, per night. If you look for parking information with tenacity, you'll find that the hotel's website mentions the $14 parking fee, and mentions a municipal lot about a block away. We didn't realize there was a municipal lot, but you might want to check it out. The other extra charge would be for breakfast: $8 per person for a continental breakfast and roughly $12 per person for the hot breakfast.

It was rated as a 3 star. *I will make some negative comments regarding hotwire at the end of this review which has no connection to the stay or services I received at this hotel* This hotel is located in a residential area, but just off a main street (Eglinton/Mt Pleasant) I would recommend this for someone wanting to see the sites of Toronto, or even doing business/working downtown since it's a nice 10 minute walk or 3 minutes bus ride to the subway and Yonge Street. There are plenty of restaurants, coffee shops and retail stores in the area at various price points. It's out of the tourist/business area, nice to go for walks, meet people, etc. Arrived and the lobby had more like a boutique(y) feel to it. Check in was seamless. Pleasant and helpful front desk staff. The whole process took about 3 minutes. Was given a room on the 3rd floor. Close to fitness room and pool. Nice room, and it was spotless! 2 comfortable beds, with great linen (sheets and towels) A nice view (facing North) Mini fridge, coffee maker, shampoo, lotion, shower cap, soap etc. It was a good sized room. Despite being on the same floor as the pool/fitness area it was super quiet. never really heard anything outside the room. Concierge was helpful, and suggested an all day breakfast restaurant just around the corner, $3.99 for a great breakfast! I believe the hotels breakfast was $8, I didn't go for it though. Parking- I found parking a couple blocks north in the residential part (this will only work on the weekends as it was posted no parking Mon-Fri 830am-430pm and I know the parking patrol in that area is ruthless) If it would have been a weekday I would have parked at the hotel as public lots for 24hrs would probably be more than the $14 the valet wanted. I live in Toronto, but if I didn't, I would stay here during visits due the location/comfort/price. It's rated a 3 star and I would agree. If you're looking for a luxury hotel it's not quite there, but I think it exceeds the standards set for \" Best Westerns\" HOTWIRE- I mention this because 1) Perhaps the hotel needs to be aware of what this company is doing to people 2) I did not find a review on this site for hotwire and I think there should be given my experience and the number of sour ones I have found in the past few days online) 3) I'm ticked The reason I booked this weekend in the first place was because I was attending an event and I wanted to be close to the venue. When I booked the 3 Star promised to be 0.9 miles from the venue it was 15 google map miles (not even in the same city. I asked for Vaughn ON and this hotel is in mid-town Toronto) When I called the company to find out what happened they told me it was 0.9 miles in a straight line via air travel!! There was no reasoning with this company. They refused to give a refund or rebook for me. They actually wanted to have me book something in the original area I wanted at a higher price AND they would give me a credit for a future stay somewhere else. I told them not only would I not be spending anymore money with them but I would also be relaying my experience to friends/family. In a nutshell, don't book through Hotwire if you are looking for a specific area. They lie. I don't know if they have always been like that or if they have just gotten too big and don't care anymore. I had used them in the past without incident, but never really needed a specific location.

After arrival, I found that downtown was very accessible (10 min walk down the street to Eglinton/Yonge subway, $2.75 and another 10 minutes or so.) I found the hotel itself to be more average than anything... The room I was in (10th/top floor) was very large, but had an odd configuration. A partial renovation seems to have occurred recently in that there was a new flat screen TV which conveniently swiveled to point at either the beds or work desk/couch, new bed sheets, and a VERY comfortable bed. There also was a handy bar fridge in the room. The bathroom was my least favourite attribute of the room... It was tiny and cramped, with an old school heat lamp that was turned on with the fan giving a red glow to the room. If they were to do a full reno of the room, I'd have them pull out a few walls and make the bathroom bigger. I never did try the restaurant, even though I was given daily 10% off coupons by the front desk as check-in. The decor looked quite tired and spartan, and I found a number of good options in the surrounding area (and in downtown Toronto). Never tried room service either as was available only during the hours the restaurant was operating. Internet access (wi-fi only) was fast, and FREE. Only minor annoyance is that it would periodically timeout and you'd be redirected to the hotel login/splash screen now and then. Overall, this is a decent hotel for a good price.

Poor customer service at the front desk for checking us into the worst view room and recommending Pizza Pizza as the only place open in the area for food.

The hotel is located in an upper-middle class area that during the 1980's was the Yuppy Capital of Canada. Fortunately, when I returned in September for the Film Festival, all of the negative things associated with that era were gone, while all of the positive things remained. This really is a charming area. You can walk to the subway in eight minutes and be downtown in another twelve to fifteen minutes. If you miss the last subway or want to pamper yourself a little, it is only fifteen dollars by cab. Do not eat breakfast in the hotel dining room. There are at least fifty great places to eat breakfast, lunch and dinner within a ten minute walk of the hotel. For breakfast, there are dozens of places on Eglinton Ave. walking towards Yonge Street. There are also lots of places at Yonge & Eglinton, the nearest major crossroads and location of the Subway station. On Saturday and Sunday Mornings I would recommend Breakfast at one of the local British or Irish Pubs. It sounds strange, but they have great Steak and Eggs for around seven dollars and bottomless cups of coffee. For Dinner, I would recommend another of Toronto's best kept secrets. Walk down Mount Pleasant Road and you will find ten to fifteen of the finest, coziest restaurants in the city. You can choose from prices ranging from reasonable to very expensive. The food and wines at the very expensive restaurants are expensive but not overpriced. One last thing, while you are staying in that area, take a walk down one or two of the neighborhood streets such as Roehampton or Soudan. There are two funky old movie theaters in the neighborhood that still show movies on a daily basis and go back to the 1920's. There are two High Schools that go back to the 20's and several churches that go back to the 1800's, yet it is still one of the hippest areas in Toronto.

I loved the rooms, we had a huge king sized bed which was absolutely to die for. It was extremely comfortable. We had numerous pillows both on the bed and in the closet. Our room was extremely clean and there were no stains on our bed as another person said. Granted the parking lot was small and poorly designed it did not matter as someone parked your car for you and brought it to the door when you wanted to leave. The location of the hotel was great. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful. We only ate breakfast at the hotel. Breakfast was a buffet style and it was overpriced for what you got. Despite the fact that I was not thrilled with breakfast it didn't matter because you were so close to other resturants. Overall, I had a fabulous stay and look forward to returning at the end of April.", "Date": "April 18, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Windsor, Ontario", "Title": "\u201cExcllent\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2781440", "Content": "I'm not sure why people complained here.

To our surprise, the location is outstanding. You are within walking distance (or a short bus ride) to many interesting and affordable restaurants for breakfast, lunch, dinner or snacks. The neighborhood is bustling with young professionals and hip singles along with enough retail to cover any buying need. The Eglinton Subway is just five blocks away and very safe and the bus stop is just feet away. You can get to any downtown location in 20 minutes or less. Or just enjoy the neighborhood you are in! Our standard Queen Bed room was affordable and decent in terms of decor and cleanliness. The hotel is a little old but rennovation and remodeling have brought it up to speed. It's accurately rated at three stars out of five. With that said, there are two main flaws: forget about the dining room and room service. Breakfast service was horrendous (due to understaffing) although the front desk people tried to make up for it. Your best bet is walking one or two blocks to several decent breakfast type places - the best being the Golden Griddle. Coffee and sandwich places abound. The other flaw is parking. I can see why they charge an exhorbarant rate of $12 per day for a lot that should cost no more than $4 per day. The lot is poorly designed and going in/out requires driving through a lane one car-length wide. If someone is pulling up to the unload luggage, forgot about coming in or going out. This is why the use of a Valet is necessary to move cars and coordinate traffic and unloading. Otherwise, there would be parking lot rage! Bottom line - a very good choice unless you are looking for pure luxury or want to be a dead in the middle of the downtown, financial, theatre or harbourfront areas and despise public transportation.", "Date": "June 15, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cOuch\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR856948", "Content": "This is got to be the worst hotel I have ever stayed at!
