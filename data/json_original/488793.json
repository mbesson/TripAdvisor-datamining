Maybe my expectations were just too high, but I was disappointed. POSITIVES: On-site staff do a good job with what they have. People were friendly at the front desk, helped me with directions; the housekeepers made my room as clean as they could. Location is very central & a short walk to great shops & restaurants. MY GRIPES: 1. My room was \"grimy.\" Stains on the shower curtain, basin, walls in the room need scrubbing, towels have been used so many times they're paper-thin. I wouldn't walk barefoot on the carpet. 2. Security. There was a front desk person present whenever I came & went, but I don't know if they were there all night. There is no elevator key card required to get onto the guest rooms and the hotel is small. I found myself spooked thinking anyone could walk in off the street & potentially be outside my door. 3. Thin walls. I heard my neighbors & forget trying to sleep in. 4. WIFI was spotty / non-functional, and no cable TV. This pissed me off. I had jet lag and was up for most of the night without internet access, trying to watch local stations through the fuzzy off-air antenna. Not cool. Note that the location is SOHO, but it's the part that runs into Chinatown. I feel a bit guilty slamming this place since so many other people found it pleasant, and the staff are really kind - but I would never return.

Overall the front desk staff were good and helpful but there were a couple of little things that we found annoying. There was supposed to be \"complimentary\" water left in the room each day but ti seemed to be that you only got it when you left a tip for the housekeeping staff. It was cheaper just to buy it. Where they did let themselves down was after we checked out. We left a couple of small, low value items in the room. We contacted the hotel immediately and it took several days of chasing before they responded - and the response was only to say that they would check to see if they could find them.

We were ontop of each other while in the room getting ready to go out. My husband spent ALOT of time waiting in the lobby or standing in the hallway.

Now cleanliness, in our case was not good. we arrived to our room with a used plastic cup on the windowsill, girls noticed lipstick \"kiss marks\" on a wall, doors and light switches were dirty.

It was 3 blocks to Spring street subway or Canal street subway and so close to all the great eateries, Galleries and shops in Soho. It was easy to get up town or to the financial district. The hotel is right over the subway lines so on the 3rd floor you heard and felt the rumble of the subway, however it wasn't a show stopper for us.

The rooms are extremely small (the bed takes up the majority of the space, and the corner of the door grazed the side of the bed when we tried to open it fully). I really liked the shampoo and conditioner (they come in these very cool screw-top lids) and there was free wi-fi (though it was down one of the days we were there, the hotel staff fixed it as soon as they could and were very courteous about it, so that was fine). No extra \"perks\" for guests to speak of (except the obligatory TV) but noise and bedbugs were not an issue, so I was happy. I spent my evenings post-work walking around shopping and eating my way through as much of NYC as I could :) Would recommend for those looking for a comfortable boutique option in this part of NYC.", "Date": "December 29, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Johannesburg", "Title": "\u201cClean, comfortable, friendly staff and lovely location.\u201d", "Author": "KB1983", "ReviewID": "UR86610127", "Content": "I arrived here after having spent a night at an awful hotel nearby.

On the plus side, this hotel is on the less expensive side for NYC, has large new bathrooms and awesome showers, nice bath toiletries, ample nice towels, and everything was very clean. The desk staff also were friendly and smiling. Location is fairly decent, as it's close to little shops and restaurants and a subway is 2 blocks away, although I would prefer to stay closer to the subway since 2 fairly unpopulated blocks are pretty long and dark at night. On the minus side, the room and its furnishings were kind of old and dingy. I didn't mind the room being small - I don't need a lot of space to shower and relax in my comfy bed for a couple of nights when I spend my days elsewhere. But the walls were a slightly grimy-looking beige, the door was institutional gray, the desk and wardrobe looked about 25 years old and the air conditioning unit even older than that. I wished the room looked a little more spruce since the old rooms didn't seem to fit very well with the shiny modern lobby. The AC did work as far as cooling the room and I guess I should be grateful for that, but the control for the AC was slightly wonky and I could not get the fan to reliably turn off resulting in the room getting very freezing during the night (and no extra blanket in the room). Also slightly wonky were the in-room safe, which worked but you sometimes had to enter the code 4-5 times to get it to lock, and the flush mechanism on the toilet, which had to be held down to flush and which occasionally made a very loud dying cow noise. I was glad I was traveling alone because the noise would have woken up anyone trying to sleep in the next room had I flushed in the night. My room had a window...that looked out on a ginormous piece of building equipment, so no points for a view. They did provide a bathrobe to use in the room but its belt was missing, so it was a bit hard to use it. Finally, I have to echo the person who said the staff didn't really check to see if the people coming in and out had a key. The outside door is not locked, there is no doorman and the staff including the night staff seem pretty young and not like they could stop anyone from going upstairs anyway. You are also not required to use a key to make the elevator stop at your floor, meaning that anybody can pretty much come in and wander around, which given that it's NYC makes me a little nervous.

We were looking for a basic but decent hotel that was close to the subway. The hotel is small -- only 42 rooms -- and has no business center, restaurant, or workout room, and not even much of a lobby. Having read that rooms on the lower floors should be avoided due to noise from the nightclub next door, we asked for a room on the highest floor possible and were given one on the top [12th] floor. It was very small, but had a nice flat-screen TV and a clean, modern bathroom -- and a view of the Empire State Building! [It had two double beds, which were each a bit small for two people but otherwise OK.] It was very quiet and we didn't hear any noise from downstairs -- surprising, since the music was very audible when we were in the lobby. We had hot water every morning with no problem [and the shower had two separate shower heads, each of which could be aimed separately]. My husband had forgotten a cable for his computer, and the front-desk clerk gave him a \"loaner\" one to use while we were there. [The free wi-fi worked well too!] Also, they delivered a New York Times to our door each morning. As advertised, the hotel was about two blocks from the subway. Our only two minor annoyances were: 1. The in-room safe didn't work; we asked for someone to fix it and were told the next evening that it was fixed, but it still didn't work. We ended up just doing without it. 2. One morning when we got on the elevator, we pushed the button to go down to the lobby, but nothing happened. We ended up walking down 12 floors. The front-desk clerk said \"Hmmm\" when we mentioned the problem and said the elevator had to be re-set, but didn't apologize. When we came back in the evening, the elevator was fixed. All was fine with it until the morning we checked out, when it was out for a few minutes for \"routine maintenance\". Other than those minor issues, the hotel delivered exactly what we had hoped for -- a clean, quiet room that was a good place to crash after a busy day.

It's well placed in Soho, so makes a change from staying in Manhattan and the usual touristy areas. Good for 'second timers' to New York who fancy something different! We found it was a good price, had nice (small, but it's New York) clean rooms, and a lovely clean bathroom with good toiletries, big towels and a good hairdryer. Our main concern was going to be noise from the nightclub having seen other reviews on here before. To solve this, we emailed the hotel direct and got a written promise we could have a room on the upper floors. We took this with us and presented it on arrival - we were given the 7th floor which was silent! Couldn't hear it at all, so our ear plugs were not needed. The hotel staff are desperate to get the club closed down, but have had no luck so far with the management and some legal reasons apparently. We had no issues with bedbugs. We had no cause to speak to the manager so can't comment on him, but the reception staff were very friendly and helpful to us. There is a good little deli over the road for breakfast, so you don't have far to go if you're starving when you wake up (no breakfast at the hotel). It's located close to Little Italy and Chinatown, and also a subway stop when coming from the airport with all your luggage; you don't have far to walk (something to bear in mind). Taxi was about $40 - $50 I think, but at 2am we didn't mind paying. Reception staff were very helpful (esp Lorelei) in providing maps and info on things to do, and how to get to attractions, calling taxis etc. There is a really good off-licence over the road with some lovely wines in (unusual in America!) but they close at 11pm, and I think 9 on a Sunday, not crucial but bear in mind if you want a drink in your room after a meal out - the next place is a fair walk away and just sells warm beer. Having said that there are plenty of nice bars around SoHo. No complaints about this hotel, and we would definitely go again and recommend to others.

If you go further north, the Village and further south the South Street Seaport. There is a decent diner across the street for breakfast, attached to the hotel is a reasonable French resto...we didn't eat here but looked at the menu and sounds OK with manageable prices considering this is NYC...Ate mostly in Chinatown since it's cheapest, Lombardi's, Katz's. We walked everywhere and saw a lot considering we were only there for 2 nights. The staff was very pleasant. Don't be put off by the gritty, old looking neighborhood. We found it safe. Locals were always milling around. It got quieter at bedtime but you probably won't be able to sleep in in the morning if needed. The Bad: the hotel room is SMALL, say 300 sq feet including bathroom area for $276/night reserved months in advance...this would have been very uncomfortable if the kids (ages 12, 7) were teenagers, the beds were up against the walls that I've banged up my elbows a couple of times..i've banged up my knees on the heating/AC unit because it was too close to the bed... you can't use the iron/board, there is no room to open up the ironing board, we had to relocate the coffee maker to the bathroom to be able to use it...and there is hardly any counter space in the bathroom, so the lesson here is don't bring a lot of luggage/toiletries because there is no room to put them (we only had a medium duffle bag and an overnighter, so it's not like we had a lot of luggage).. the hotel also sells itself as a boutique hotel, i don't see the reason, yeah they have ONE bath robe, there were 4 of us...Oh, maybe because their shampoo/conditioner is organic?.... Make sure you know the address, we passed it by because it does not have a marquee on top. I saw another couple looking for it and they would have passed it if they hadn't heard us talking about the hotel. All in all I would stay here again if i can't find anywhere else to stay.

The heat worked well (very important to me), and it had standard beds and pillows. They also provide you with a robe. There is a small wardrobe for you to store your clothes in, but don't plan on putting your luggage in there, as it won't likely fit. I just left my bag on the extra bed. The bathroom is clean, the toiletries are good, and the shower/water pressure is good too. They have a double shower head which was interesing. My room was right next to the elevator and I had no problems with noise. On a side note...one of my colleagues requested a smoking room and ended up with a room right above the adjacent club. He didn't sleep for days. :-P We thought maybe it was to discourage people from the habit. Location is very convenient. You can walk to Little Italy, Chinatown, and Soho. It's easy to catch a cab. You can grab breakfast across the street at the diner. if you are inclined. The staff at reception offered great restaurant recommendations in Little Italy, all within walking distance.

We traveled there from California to celebrate the New Year. On the morning of our second day, i noticed what i thought were mosquito bites on my arms and abdomen and i dismissed it as such. Later that evening i mentioned the bites to my companion and she told me she had the same thing. To my knowledge i have never been bitten by a bedbug so the thought of being bitten by one never crossed my mind until she told me about her bites. After my conversation with her i told the desk clerk that i thought our room had bedbugs. He kind of dismissed it saying they would have the room swept the next day (our departure day). Upon checking out, the desk clerk gave me the name and number of the hotel manager (Mr. Hakim) and aked me to call him the following day. After returning home, i called the hotel and asked for Mr. Hakim. I was told he was out of the building and would return soon. I left my name and telephone number with the person answering the phone and asked that he call me when he returned. When i did not hear from him, i telephoned the hotel again. This time i was told Mr. Hakim was ill and did not return to the hotel the previous day. I left a second message asking that he call me. To this day he has not called me back! In the meantime i went to Choice Hotels web site and left an email regarding my experience at the hotel. I wrote that i simply wanted the manager to return my call to listen to my concern. My guess is my email was sent to Mr Hakim because i received an email (not a phone call) from him. The email was an apology and it stated the hotel would refund 30% of my last night's room rate, roughly $30 dollars. I sent an email back to Mr. Hakim asking that he call me and telling him i thought his offer was unacceptable! After returning home i went to a doctor because the bites on my body were extremely uncomfortable and the skin around the bite sites was dying and peeling off. Upon seeing the bites the doctor said he knew they were made by bedbugs. After returning home i mentioned my experience to a co-worker. He provided me with an article written in November 2007 describing the bedbug problem on the east coast as near epidemic. I have never written a review of a hotel or any other business in my life and i probably would have never written this one had i received a call from someone in charge at the hotel willing to listen to my concerns. Instead i was dismissed and ignored! Bedbugs are disgusting littled creatures. I don't know if my reaction to their bites is common. It is now January 14th and i still have evidence of the bites on my skin. The thing that concerns me the most is they could have gotten into my suitcase or other clothing and i could have transported them home. They can live up to a year without feeding. Once you have them in your house they are extremely difficult to get rid of. I wanted soemone at the hotel to be responsive to my concerns, they were not!!

The A/C was one of the loudest I've encountered, but that did mask the street noise and music from the nightclub others have mentioned. On this visit I was required to have a vehicle. The nearest garage was about 3 blocks away and cost just under $40 dollars to park overnight. Did I mention that this place is small!! There are only 4 rooms per floor!! I could literally stand in the elevator and open the door to my room. The Ugly: I had to cut my stay short due to being called home by my employer. I immediately called the hotel from my work location and told them I would be checking out 2 days early. The desk clerk said OK not a problem. The night before my departure I stopped by the desk to confirm everything with the desk clerk. At first they denied I had met the notification deadline and they would have to charge for an extra night. After I showed her my phone log she then said I told them I was checking out not the next day but the day after that. She said she would check into it and get back to me. She never did. The next morning at checkout the desk clerk was adamant that I said Thurs and not Wed and refused to remove the charge for the extra night. The manager had not arrived for work yet so I couldn't discuss it with them. Since I had a plane to catch I couldn't hang around to wait for the manager to show up. The matter has been turned over to my corporate travel office for resolution. If you are in NYC for pleasure this place might be OK depending on your tastes. If you are there on business avoid it like the plague. The lack of facilities, size and flexibility on the managements part make it a poor choice in my opinion.", "Date": "June 30, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ohio", "Title": "\u201cA great experience & reasonably priced\u201d", "Author": "July2006traveller", "ReviewID": "UR7640815", "Content": "I had a very enjoyable stay at this hotel, which is modern, well-maintained, well staffed, and in a great location.

We were also right by Broadway with all it's shops and only five mins from the centre of cultural Soho.

The bathroom was fine, beds comfy, housekeeping a high standard. Front desk girls were great - guys not so helpful. Cheap entry to a fantastic gym around the corner was a bonus. One problem - a noisy club abutts the hotel and we could hear \"duf duf\" on the 5th floor on one night. Fortunately we travel with a white noise maker to drown out such noises. I know the hotel is concerned about this and is trying to tone them down. Best bet - book a room above the 5th floor. In summary, not a \"special\" hotel but a good, honest and exceptionally well positioned place to call home for a few nights.

Tremendous location. We walk, and we could get to so many places in a half-hour. Plus, subway stops are nearby. Area is in transition, meaning much construction, but did not affect our stay.

This year we stayed at the Solita again. The staff there is wonderful, the place was clean and safe, and while it is low on storage space, you can make it work. The one thing I'd love to see them put in is some coat hooks on the wall though :) The beds are comfortable and the room was quite clean. Yes, the room is small, but for the rates and amount of time you actually spend in the room, it's works well. The shower actually has water pressure which is also a nice touch. :) Everyone at the front desk greeted us and there were cars waiting for us when we needed to leave the area. The front desk person was nice enough to arrange that for us when we mentioned we were checking out later that day. The only issue we had was noise from the nightclub downstairs on one of the four nights we were there. The music was turned up loudly, and I think when we go back we will ask for a higher floor (we were on floor 4). The neighborhood is great. You have soho 3 blocks away, chinatown and the subway 2 blocks away, and litte italy 2 blocks away. There's a great diner across the street (reasonable priced, decent food and I have never seen two people work as hard as the ladies in there do). Great for a cheap breakfast or a quick lunch. :) The bar around the corner (Lafayette bar) is a great place (not responsible for the aforementioned noise either). Very nice group of people there.

We were attracted to the hotel by the good rates and downtown location and were definitely not disappointed. Just a few blocks from the main streets of Chinatown and Little Italy the hotel is in a perfect location to explore the downtown area of Manhattan. Greenwich village, Union Square and the East Village are all walkable if you're a keen walker like me. For places further aflied the Subway is just two blocks away. For breakfast a cafe is located across the street which serves reasonable food and there are lots of other cafes and restaurants in the surrounding area. At night we felt, and indeed were, perfectly safe walking the streets even well past midnight. To the previous reviewer, if you were scared walking around here I dread to think how you would react to a genuinely unsafe neighbourhood. As for our room it was small, as you would expect in NY, but clean and comfortable. Bathroom was compact but we got a small tub and a lovely two-headed shower. The \"queen\" beds were pretty small but very cosy, and you get a flatscreen TV with plenty of channels. We were up on the 10th floor and had a good view of the old Police Headquarters building and the surrounding streets. The \"nightclub\" mentioned in other reviews was audible from the lobby but not from our room. Incidentally the entrance to this bar is around the corner on Lafayette Street and is worth a visit - Moroccan themed with live music and a fun, unpretentious crowd of people there.

I stayed on the 7th floor and my room was barely larger than a suburban bedroom, it felt more like a dorm room at college. It was roughly 10x12, clean but very basic, no closet, just a bureau sitting next to a small queen size bed which filled the room. The bathroom was small but clean. My window faced out to the brick wall of a neighboring building and there were construction noises permeating the windows from all around. My neighbors in adjacent rooms felt it necessary to talk in the hallway and party through the night so the doors were no barrier to the commotion that went on in the other 3 rooms on my floor. The hotel straddles Little Italy and Chinatown, but the immediate area is devoid of all life and there's no activity. It was pretty scary at night walking around the surrounding neighborhood.
