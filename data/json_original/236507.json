We got a Deluxe room (#42) for 7 nights and primarily chose Le Regent because of the stellar feedback on Tripadvisor. It was a great trip but we only used the hotel to sleep in since we were out being tourists all day and evening. With that said, 235 euros a night is a bit pricey for using it maybe 9 or 10 hours of the day. The staff was wonderful, spoke good English and entertained our poor French. They made suggestions and asked us for our feedback on activities we did. Room was very clean and made nicely each day. I would say the location is pretty good like most reviews. The metro was close (we usually walked to the St Michel station since the walk was nice and there are more trains out of that station over Odeon which may be a little closer). I would also add, since this was one of my big questions, is that I always felt safe in and around the neighborhood. The main CON is that we had a street side room (by choice) that looked out on Rue Dauphine which was a very great view BUT the street noise was terrible. I woke up each night to something, whether it was people yelling or trash trucks and even 6AM construction of some sort a couple buildings down. The windows in our room were not very soundproof. I literally listened to a conversation on the street one night while i laid in bed with the windows shut. And we were on the 5th floor! And i dont have some sort of bionic super strong hearing! I ended up playing music on my iPod and going back to sleep. This didn't ruin my stay, but it is a little disconcerting that I pay $300+ (american dollars) a night in a great neighborhood and have trouble sleeping because of noise. **I will say that I did not bring this issue up with the hotel, because the hotel was close to full, we were already settled, and we didn't want to be those Americans that complained about everything! My advice to anyone in my situation or close to it, evaluate how much time you want to spend in a hotel. There are cheaper options that are either not as extravagant or further away. If a hotel is just a room to sleep in and take a shower, like it was for us, we would probably stayed somewhere else or have chosen the smaller room. The metro is highly reliable and useful, but it is nice to be close and be able to walk places instead. But on the flip side, if you aren't on a tight budget, Le Regent is almost flawless, maybe ask for an interior room, or ask about street noise feedback in the room you are in.", "Date": "October 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tel Aviv, Israel", "Title": "\u201cBad value for money\u201d", "Author": "RannTel-Aviv", "ReviewID": "UR119579230", "Content": "Stayed at this hotel for 6 nights in October 2011, based on positive reviews read here. Unfortunately, the hotel did not live up to expectations in all fields. After previously having stayed at centrally located hotels in big cities, I decided to book a (standard) double room even though I was travelling on my own. This was done to avoid being given a very small cell-like room (something which I have experienced more than once). Nevertheless, the room allotted to me at the Regent Hotel was definitely the smallest I have ever had. Although it was fully equipped with all necessary amenities, there was virtually no room to stand up in. Even worse, the toilet was almost impossible to sit on as it was positioned very closely to the opposite wall. Knees and forehead actually touched this wall when using the toilet (I am of average height, if you are wondering). Having said this, the hotel is well appointed, clean, about a two minute walk from the Odeon Metro station and in the middle of the Saint Germain / Latin Quarter area, giving easy access to Paris' attractions and being situated in a main nightlife area (the later causing a bit of street noise at night, especially since the hotel faces a rather main street). The staff was very helpful and spoke fluent English. Since the Metro system in Paris is extremely efficient, I would opt for a higher notch hotel away from the centre of town which could be booked for a similar price (I paid 144 Euros per night at the Regent for a standard double room. A continental breakfast is an additional 14 Euros and a full English one 18. There are many dining options in the hotel's immediate area for less). All in all, and judging by other reviews, if you do decide to stay at this hotel, book a Superior Deluxe room and not a standard double, although in my opinion, it is way overpriced in any case.", "Date": "October 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Annandale, Virginia", "Title": "\u201cWonderful stay, great location\u201d", "Author": "Constance W", "ReviewID": "UR119339784", "Content": "My husband, sister-in-law and I had a wonderful stay at Hotel Le Regent recently.

We reserved a Superior Deluxe room so we could all share one room. It was a little tight with the extra bed in there, but was bigger than we expected it would be. The bathroom was a nice size, and the shower had great water pressure, which was nice after long days of sightseeing. Our room overlooked the street, and there was some noise from the cafes, but it was not bad, although our visit was during the week, so I don't know if it would have been a problem on the weekend. The hotel staff were all extremely helpful, particularly Elias. He gave us perfect directions for getting to several sights, including the Seine cruise, and a trip to Versailles, and provided recommendations for other things to see and places to eat. The price seemed comparable to other hotels that I looked at, and the great location makes it an even better value. The only negatives were the very small elevator (luckily we were on the 2nd floor, so only had to use the elevator for our arrival and departure when we had our luggage) and the slowness of the internet connection.

During our 4-day stay in August it was quite warm, but the air conditioning worked perfectly by American standards. We were delighted to stay in room 41, a deluxe superior room. This hotel, unlike some others nearby, describes on its website the size of the room. Yes, the regular rooms are smaller, but that is what you ask for when you book them. This deluxe superior room cost 180 euros over the internet and offered great value. Both the bedroom and the bathroom were large by left-bank standards. The bed was comfortable but a little soft for my personal preferences. While smoking is permitted in this hotel, there was no sign of any foul smell. Room 41 has 3 windows overlooking rue Dauphine; even though one of our four nights was a Saturday, there was no noise to complain about on any night. The shower was excellent, with good force and without any annoying change in temperature common in many hotels. There was plenty of shelf and closet space. As others have noted, the hairdryer blows hot but not with much vigor. So if you need something stronger, bring your own. But for me it was OK. And yes, the bedroom floor is a little slanted; so leave your marbles at home. The location epitomizes Paris. There are all types of markets, cafes, bistros, bakeries, gelato (Amorino is to die for), all within a block or so of the hotel. In my opinion, one could not ask for a better location, merely 3 blocks from the Ile de la Cite at the other end of rue Dauphine. While the hotel does offer a breakfast at 14 euros a person, we declined and ate out every morning. We especially liked the Cafe de Paris on rue Buci that offered for 12.50 euros a breakfast of fresh juice, hot coffee or tea, a 3-egg omelet with ham and cheese, and a croissant as well as bread and jam. Just outside the hotel there is an ATM machine. And around the corner there is a super market. Everything one needs is so close and convenient. If one likes classical music, there are frequent evening concerts in Sainte Chapelle. The acoustics are superb and the setting magical. The hotel staff--Henry, Sandrine, and Angelique--are very friendly, efficient, and helpful in giving advice, explaining things, and making reservations. The bottom line is that there is nothing to dislike about this hotel. The elevator is a bit small, but that is about it.

Our double bed consisted of two narrow singles pushed together, but since we are not large, this was just fine for us. Our room was on the fifth floor bright, pretty and comfortable, with several tall windows looking overlooking the Rue Dauphine. If street noise bothers you, bring earplugs. The evening noise is the price you pay for being in the middle of a busy neighborhood off the Blvd. St. Germaine with many cafes and for the street view. We had a large modern bathroom with a deep bathtub and sunshine yellow tiles, and a towel warmer. There is an elevator just big enough for two people and their luggage.

The hotel was close to the Odeon Metro stop that was well connected for most everywhere I wanted to go. It is also very centrally located for walking just about anywhere. There is also a Champion grocery marche located just a block over. I had room #24 on the 2nd floor that faced the courtyard (I use that term loosely). I heard no street noise whatsoever. The staff was very friendly and helpful. I was traveling solo and booked a standard room for one person. This was my 5th trip to Paris and umpteenth to Europe, so I expected a small room -- and it was indeed VERY small. I am not a large person but I was still bumping into just about everything. I was able to store my smaller carry on in the ample closet and probably could have squeezed my larger case in as well if I'd put one inside the other and pushed the clothes together. Didn't think of it ::shrug:: It was clean, everything was in good shape and had almost everything I needed and wasn't bad enough I felt the need to change hotels or request an upgrade to the Deluxe room which was 50 Euro more per night. If my husband had been with me, we'd have needed to upgrade to a larger room. For the first time I did not pack a travel clock because it seems that every room I've ever stayed in has had a clock - except this one. The wake up call feature on the phone didn't seem to work, but the desk was happy enough to set one for me each evening. The only stations in English on the TV were MSNBC Europe which was all financial news all the time and two different BBC channels, one of which the sound was so bad you could barely understand it. So if TV is important to you...not much in that way. There was a mini bar fridge in the room that contained a couple sodas and water for 3,50 Euro each. I used it to store my nightcap wine. The bathroom, while so small you had to sit sideways on the toilet, seemed brand new and featured a good sized shower stall that had glass doors. The biggest problem with the shower (which had great water pressure and fairly regulated temperature) was that it was about a 12\" step to get in - which isn't such a big deal until you're wet and need to step out - but again, the bathroom was so small you could put your hand on the door jam and the other on the sink for support. The other problem for me in the bathroom was that the hair dryer was located next to the toilet, so to use it you had to stand in the tiny space between the toilet and the wall. I rapped my elbows on not only the tissue dispenser, but the heated towel rack (that didn't work). Might not be an issue if your hair is short and you don't need much interaction between dryer and brush. The best thing about the room for me was that the bed was very comfortable - not too soft and not too hard - seems like every hotel I've stayed in in Europe has felt like sleeping on the box springs. There is an more expensive hotel down the street called Hotel d'Aubusson that has a lovely bar with a jazz band that plays on Friday & Saturday nights. It is on the corner of rue Dauphine and rue Christine. On rue Christine, there is a great little restaurant called Chez Fernand. I might stay there again, but go for a larger room.

When looking for a Paris hotel we were hoping to come close to that same sort of experience. We were once again very lucky. When you walk out the front door of Le Regent you know you are in Paris and the sights, sounds and smells are unmistakable. Turn right and three short blocks later you are looking across the Seine at the Louvre. Turn left and within a block you are in the midst of the St. Germain des Pres boulevard scene. Straight ahead is the very active le Buci. Obviously we were very pleased with the location. We took the train from CDG for a few Euros to the St. Michel staiton and walked the last couple blocks to the hotel. St. Michel also gets you on the RER to Versailles. For the rest of our poking around the city we used the very handy Odeon Metro station. Walking to Notre Dame was very pleasant, and a long leisurely walk back from the Eiffel Tower was doable. St. Sulpice, the Luxembourg Gardens, the D'Orsay and Louvre are all nearby. The area is very active with restaurants and bars galore and a sprinkling of retailers of all descriptions, grocery stores, bakeries, and ice cream shops mixed in. The venerable Jacques Cagna restaurant is within a couple blocks on Rue des Grands Augustins for an easy relaxed Michelin starred experience. In spite of the beat of the area the room windows (which appear to be relatively new) keep out all but the loudest street noises. We had a superior deluxe room overlooking Rue Dauphine, and while a little small, it offered everything we needed including a very upscale en-suite bathroom. The multi-lingual staff was especially accommodating and always greeted us with a smile and words of encouragement and advice. We used them for restaurant recommendations and reservations as well as transportation requirements. We would have given the hotel a \"5\" but the carpet in the room was due for replacement and we would have enjoyed a few more square feet. Everything but the carpet was perfectly clean. We got a peek at the smaller rooms and they would not have been acceptable for us so the few extra euros was worth it. With all of the action outside (even a Starbucks up the street) we did not bother with the 14E breakfast at the hotel but rather grabbed some local pastries in the morning.

I would definately recommend to other visitors and I would definately stay there again!", "Date": "August 5, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "usa", "Title": "\u201cloved it\u201d", "Author": "google", "ReviewID": "UR3675844", "Content": "Great location.

We had room 15, which was a little small, but clean and located on the 1st floor (one flight up). It served its purpose, being that we weren't really in the room for long periods of time. The staff was very helpful: Sandrine and Ilias (sp?). They were nice enough to help us with car reservations, and also gave us a plug converters to use while we were there. There was also free wifi connection, so bring your laptop if you can't get away from the internet! It was centrally located, with a wondeful variety of shops, creperies, markets, bakeries, and restaurants. The metro was 1 1/2 blocks away, but we did not even bother taking it. We ended up walking everywhere. The Louvre and Notre Dame was 15 minutes away. Musee D'Orsay was a little bit of a longer walk, but it's a nice walk along the Seine. Jardin du Luxombourg is also a very close walk, as is the Latin quarter, which is happening in the late hours, with many creperies, falafel and gyro stands. It has a great vibe and you can eat on a bench in front of a lit and beautiful Notre Dame. I would definitely consider staying there again. It was a great location, as well as very pleasant staff.", "Date": "May 6, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "denver", "Title": "\u201cle regent -beware\u201d", "Author": "finesilver", "ReviewID": "UR3422530", "Content": "I have stayed at this hotel several times before ,made a reservation for 5 nights but left today after one night, there was a stain of some sort on the carpet that had to be cleaned today, so they first offered us the choice to move rooms tomorrow, then called back and said that we had to move today and that the carpet repairmen would be there in 30 minutes and that there \"might\" be some smell. the other room they proposed was not nearly as nice and it was kind of take it or leave it. while we were asking the woman at the desk about this the manager of the hotel came down and started yelling at the desk clerk right in front of us, my french is not great but I understand enough that she was calling us \"dumb stubborn\" americans to the clerk, it was most inappropriate. the manager then stormed off. we immediately went upstairs and packed and found another hotel down the street. I travel alot all over the world and have never had an experience like this, as totally unprofessional as ever; if there was a problem with the room why did they let us stay there even one night.

The elevator (lift) is small and I'm horribly claustrophobic, so we opted to climb the stairs. The bellman brought our bags up to our room. There were two twin beds, pushed together to make a king bed. The bathroom was small, but separated into a \"potty room\" and the lavatory and tub/shower area. It was spotless, fresh, had obviously been updated recently. Our two windows looked out on Rue Dauphine, with window boxes of red geraniums in each. The room was small, but very efficiently arranged. We never had breakfast in the hotel, as there are numerous cafes in walking distance. We loved this hotel, except for one thing. It was so noisy during the late night hours! From 11 p.m. until the wee hours of the morning, there was activity going on in the streets below. If I went again, I'd ask for a room away from the street.
