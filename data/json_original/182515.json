Being from BC I was quite familiar with downtown hotels and have stayed in the Sheraton to the Coasts. When first getting to the Burrard, you may be dismayed by the lackluster exterior. However once you get inside it is a different story. With a modern look in the lobby you are greeted by very friendly and knowledgeable front desk agents. They seemed to take a genuine interest in why you are there. Check in was a breeze, so up to our rooms we went. Again walking to the rooms, there is an outside garden terrace, but not alot of action going on there. Still the exterior gives you a bit of a truck stop motel feeling. We enter the room. A large Queen bed, plush blankets and pillows and a large flat screen tv. There are plenty of pamphlets to tell you the amenities. Best of all there are free bicycle rentals. The bikes are in quite good condition (touring bikes, I believe it was 4 speeds), and they supply you with a helmet free of charge. Close enough to the bike trails along the sea walls etc. We enjoyed it so much we stayed 3 nights, when it was originally supposed to be one. With modern very comfortable rooms at less than $100/night with free bike rentals, the Burrard is a welcome surprise downtown Vancouver, and absolutely fantastic value. I would definitely stay here again.", "Date": "April 13, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kelowna, Canada", "Title": "\u201cExcellent location in the heart of Vancouver\u201d", "Author": "BeautyForAshes", "ReviewID": "UR127155129", "Content": "My husband and I stayed here for 1 night on our way through Vancouver.

The down side to being in downtown Vancouver is that it's noisy at night but that's to be expected. The hotel has a retro vibe that my husband and I loved and everything was done very tastefully. I wouldn't recommend this hotel for families with children or seniors, it's definitely for the younger crowd. The hotel also has some great perks such as cruiser bikes that you can sign out free of charge.

I visited Vancouver in March time, which is great, managed to catch some sunny days during this trip, which is a great experience by itself. When I arrived the hotel, the check-in process was ok, nothing particular. However, I later found out the elevator is not working (some building concent issues I later found out) so that you have to climb the stairs everyday. The room is great, stylish with nice capsule coffee supplied. Good size LCD TV, clean, nice bathroom, a bit small, but not uncomfortable at all. So this makes up for the bad experience I had from the elevator incident. However, the housekeeping is really terrible, which is what made my rating for this hotel is so low. During the entire duration of my stay, they did not replace my sheets nor re-supply my shower ammendies etc. It said they will change sheets every 2nd day, but for the whole time I stayed, they did not change it for me. As for ammendies, they did not replace them at all. So it's like no shampoo, no soap, not even tissue. I had to call everytime to get them, and it is always when you need it and you realized that they are not there, which made the experience really inconvenient.

The rooms are rather small (as you would expect for a former motel), cinderblock affairs, painted white, with attractive, stylish touches - silver ottomans, clear plastic nesting tables, 50s retro-style lamps, and bright artwork. The beds are very comfortable (we had a 'queen +' room), with high-end bedding and plenty of pillows. By the way, we were glad for the extra pillows to jam over our heads starting at about 5:30 in the morning, when incredibly loud garbage pickup took place in the back alley - with that, the construction going on all around the hotel and the fact that you're close to the street traffic (the hotel is only 4 floors) be prepared for a noisy stay. The amenities were excellent, and included IPod/IPhone dock, 42 inch wall-mounted HDTV with premium channels Nespresso individual coffee maker, free bikes, and free, speedy Internet access. A few drawbacks - it was hard to find the premium channels on the TV as there was no guide, there was no cream for our coffee, and no bottled water in the mini-fridge - the cream and bottled water were both available in the lobby. There was also no elevator (it appears to have been permanently removed), so be prepared for a walk up a rather spartan stairwell!

Honestly when I bought the package, I looked at the Burrard's website and was not totally sure how we would like it. However we both really liked everything - newly painted and furnished room with a comfy King size bed, Nespresso machine (we since bought our own coz we liked it so much), retro looking bathroom. I believe you also got free local calls, free bottles of water, use of scooters etc.. And the location was perfect as we walked to Davie St for the free Denny's birthday breakfast. The front desk was very friendly. And we also enjoyed the garden in the middle of the building.

The rooms are simply furnished, but tasteful and comfortable. I liked the location very well. Service was good. However, while it was a hot summer weekend, the room was just stifling. There's no fan in the bathrooms and no air conditioning or fan of any kind. The rooms all have a window on the courtyard and a window facing the outside of the building - so no breeze at all. I called the front desk and they brought me a box fan, saying it was the last one they had and that it had to be taken from housekeeping. Other guests complained about it while I was checking out and the man behind the desk explained that the new owners had done a lot of work and spent a lot of money on the place and that this was something they had yet to get to. Still, even a table fan in each room would help. Everyone was uncomfortable. Also note, this hotel charges easily twice what other hotels in the area charge for parking.
