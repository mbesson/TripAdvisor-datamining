The hotel management are crooks! Also complete LIARS! I booked a night's stay at this hotel and booked a single room with a double bed for the option of a couple's stay. I asked beforehand for room with large bed instead of two single beds. It stated online that it would be 20 euro extra for an extra person to stay in the room. I booked single because I did not know if my boyfriend would arrive that day or the next. My boyfriend was able to arrive that same day.. So when I checked into the Hotel I asked if I can pay 20 euro extra for 2 people. They told me it was not possible to stay with a man in my room unless we had a marriage certificate. I told them that it did not state in the hotel rules that you had to be married to stay at the hotel as a couple! They said it is their rules and they can do whatever they pleased. So I told them \"Fair, But then I would like to cancel my reservation because we are staying together.\" Then they were very rude and said \"You will not get your money back, You have to cancel 2 days before your stay!\" I explained to them that it is not fair for them to not have in the hotel rules that you have to be married and if we are not able to stay at your hotel for their \"moral views\" then its only fair to refund my money and let us find another hotel who are not as strict. The refused and said it was impossible and that I would not get my money back and then I said \"Fine, I will not stay but I will dispute the charges with my credit card because I think it is very unfair.\" The manager was also very rude and would not talk to us. We argued with the reception for over an hour about this! Even the baggage handler said it was very unfair how they were treating us as he took my bags back out front and said he was Sorry. I later stayed at some very nice hotels in Istanbul and we had no problem staying at any hotels together no one asked our marital status and everywhere else had great customer service and made the rest of the vacation a pleasant one. When I arrived back in the sates I contacted Booking.com and told them what happened ..I was informed from a supervisor that they would refund my money because they did not have in \"the rules\" that you had to be \"married\" to stay there and since we were refused accom that I should not have to pay. 2 weeks went by with no response from Booking and then I wrote them because my credit card was not credited. Then they wrote me saying that the hotel completely lied and said that They did not refuse my stay because of marriage but that I did not want to pay 20 euro extra! And also had the nerve to say I stayed in hotel alone!! I cannot believe that they would lie like that . They will not get away with this awful behavior. Hopefully Booking.com will make this right. I would stay at another hotel they have no HUMAN DECENCY", "Date": "September 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Paris, France", "Title": "\u201cWasn't the best price/quality/location compromise\u201d", "Author": "TheAlextase", "ReviewID": "UR117097793", "Content": "Good hotel, execp the location.

The best thing about this hotel is the spa area. The pool is heated, the Turkish bath very nice and also there are sauna and hammam everything free of charge.
