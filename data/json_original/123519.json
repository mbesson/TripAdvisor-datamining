So in the end, we choose Le Marais, and it was one of the best decisions we've ever made!!! 1. Stay...Boutique hotel.....one needs to understand what that means. In short laymen's terms...it's small and chic. What I like to call clean and crisp. Modern and sleek. This hotel defines that. Loved the newness about it and the non oldness of New Orleans feel while being in the heart of New Orleans. The bed was beyond comfortable and the overall feel was amazing. We checked out the Royal Sonesata and there is no comparison. The Royal Sonesta hotel is very nice and ornate, but it felt VERY OLD and not the newness that we love being part of. The pool at Le Marais although very small, very appropriate. We stayed for a week and had it all to ourselves with the exception of a couple couples in the pool which we actually enjoyed engaging with. 2. Perfect location....Our hotel was in the heart of it all! 1 block off Bourbon, and in the best proximity to royal street and everywhere we wanted to explore 3. Service...the staff treated us with the utmost respect and accommodation. We made frequent requests and its was so admirable that the front desk would not even accept a tip from us even though we tried to make them take it. We also had another mishap where we left our luggage for a very late checkout and the staff broke one of our bottles of wine and not only offered to repay us with the wine but also to pay to replace everything in our bag on top of the dry cleaning bill. It was not necessary but the level of service they provided to even accommodate that made us feel so appreciated. 2 recommendations we would make is: 1, Have chairs on their balconies. It's a beautiful seating area, make it worthwhile to be there 2. Bar food. The hotel is extremely accomidating with having food by poolside, but it would be really nice to not have to order in and have them supply \"bar food\" No matter what, I would not stay anywhere else and would recommend this hotel to anyone who visits there. you will not be dissappointed!!!!", "Date": "August 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Belgium", "Title": "\u201cExcellent location, super clean, design boutique hotel\u201d", "Author": "QualiGuidesBelgium", "ReviewID": "UR135932707", "Content": "The Hotel is perfectly located in the very heart of the French Quarter , just a few steps from the famous Bourbon Street.

He said he would bring us a small plug in fan but NEVER did! The doors appeared to shut and sounded as tho they shut but the doors were very hard to shut and latch. (Conversations with other hotel guests confirmed they had this issue as well) We were able to hear every conversation guests/maids had while walking thru the hallways! (Conversations with numerous other hotel guests, from different floors than I, confirmed they had this issue as well) Then my card was charged $28 more dollars than the receipt I signed at the front desk while checking out. Basically they LIED to me about how much my card was getting charged. However, the hotel did give me a refund of this $28 bucks within a few days. Also upon checkout, the front desk could not describe the valet parking procedures or give me a timeframe on how long it would be before the valet brought my car around... Overall I'll never stay at the Hotel Le Marias in New Orleans again.

The Service All staff were very friendly and the front desk staff were always available to answer questions or book any tours. Check in was very quick and our room was available early which was nice after a very early flight. The Room We had a courtyard view room, two double beds. The room was very clean and comfortable. Being a boutique hotel the decor was modern and the beds were very comfortable with nice bedding. We never heard any noise after we retired so we got good sleeps. Amenities It was nice to get bottles of water in the room, and our complimentary bar beverage was a nice touch - although I would argue that you should receive a free drink for every night you're staying as one nighters get one drink as well. The pool and outdoor courtyard was a nice refuge when looking to unwind after a long day in the quarter, in fact most times we had it to ourselves. The music and free beverages (non-alcoholic) outside added to our enjoyment. It's a nice perk to have a free breakfast however most days it was cold unfortunately - but free is free. The free wi-fi was easy to connect to and I appreciated the business centre and being able to print our boarding passess for free.

As far as the paper thin walls, I requested a room away from the elevator and we never heard any outside noise. Slept very quietly the entire time.

The hotel shares a garage with the Royal Sonesta and either the one valet was parking a car, or they don't stay on hand outside this hotel, but it's not marked very clearly about where to go or what to do. I left my husband in the street and went into the hotel where they told me to pull behind a vehicle and wait and several minutes later, someone finally came out to help with our bags.

The breakfast was nice but after a few days you've had enough since the menu doesn't change. I recommend daisy dukes and the bourbon house for a full hearty breakfast. As far as housekeeping I have to say it sucks. I booked a double bed room but received single amenities--1robe 3 towels 1set of toiletres note housekeeping never restocked supplies until I asked them to. On one occasion I was in the room while housekeeping was cleaning my bathroom I watched as she used a rag to clean the debris from the shower and took the same rag and wiped the toliet seat I asked her to please re clean the toliet seat using a new rag she looked at me as if I were crazy then did as I asked. A poor job was done when it came to dusting and changing the sheets everyday.

After reading reviews here on TA, I was convinced this was the right hotel for us. I highly recommend this hotel if you want to be in the heart of the French Quarter, but away from all the noise it brings, and if you are looking for a modern, cool, hip and small intimate hotel, without breaking the bank. Location: Between crazy, fun Bourbon Street and artful, sophisticated Royal Street. Perfect for those who are like me, and like a little of both. I loved how we could walk off Bourbon and sneak into our hip hotel, which almost seemed hidden in the street. It's like a secret. Rooms: I emailed a request a week before our stay for a room away from the elevators (which I read on here, how noisy it can be). They honored our request and our room was located in what seemed like a private hall which only consisted of a few rooms. It was perfect! The walls are thin, and we happened to have two very noisy neighbors, one partying until the wee morning hours, and another with the kid crying at night. Oh well, it is New Orleans, and not the hotel's fault. The room was what I expected. Very nice, and the bed was extremely comfortable. The bathroom was small for two people, but it works. My only complaint here is although the modern shower design is cool, it was very difficult for me to shave my legs. Since there is such little room, no bar close to the water, or anything - yoga balancing skills are a must. Large TV, desk, chair, dresser, safe, bottled water . . .everything one needs. Kids: I was surprised to see kids here, not many, but a few. This hotel does not cater to kids, and honestly, if you have kids here . . .why? The pool is small, there is no restaurant - only a bar, and you get a free cocktail upon check in, this should be your clue. Pool: The lagoon type pool is small, intimate and great for a mid-day cool off while sipping a cocktail. My one complaint here is they need to keep the towel supply full. I had to ask for more towels and saw it empty on two occasions. Staff: Very friendly, and all went our of their way for any request. We were greeting every time we entered or left the hotel. Any questions were answered and they had no problem calling a taxi for us to the airport. Cleanliness: Clean, but not perfect. I felt the hotel could improve in this area. There was a dead roach in the courtyard that laid there for a bit. (yes, I do realize roaches are common and should be expected down South) The rooms were cleaned, but I also felt housekeeping could have made the bathrooms sparkle a bit more. For some reason our housekeeper never took our tip - very odd. Breakfast: No complaints on continental breakfast. The bacon was perfect. There was fruit, juices, some type of egg (scrambled or boiled) each day, bread, muffins, yogurt, cereal and coffee. You won't go away hungry. Bar: Very nice. Great for a cocktails while swimming, or nice to sit at before heading out for the evening, or returning from your night. Great music - young top 40's. Bartenders, like the rest of the staff are very nice and personable. Would I stay here again? Absolutely! This really is an excellent hotel at a great price.

We stayed for 5 nights and never ran out of things to do in the area. Within a 15 minute walk from the hotel, you can get to any part of the French Quarter. The Canal streetcar and St. Charles streetcar are only a couple minutes away ($1.25 per ride or $3 for an unlimited use day pass on New Orleans public transit system) if you want to explore outside of the French Quarter. The rooms: I think many of the other reviews provide good detail on the rooms. On the advice of others from this website, we asked for a courtyard room away from the elevators, and we were not disappointed. We were very pleased with our room (on the 5th floor). Briefly, the rooms are clean, cozy, modern, and while they are on the small side, they are nicely appointed. We were 2 adults and a child in our room and with bathing suits and towels - there just weren't enough hooks. Because of this, we found ourselves leaving our towels in the tub when they really didn't need to be replaced - we just didn't have anywhere to hang them to dry to use again the next day. Extra hooks would help tremendously. Room service was great... press the green button by the light switch when you are leaving and by the time you get back, the room has been made up. (Thanks Maria for such great service). The swimming pool and courtyard: There is a beautiful and quaint courtyard off the lobby/bar area. It was a great location for the complementary breakfast and for relaxing after a long day of walking. The pool is warm and partially shaded. It's on the small side (about 12' by 20') and about 4' deep. The seating bench makes it a bit like a hot tub or warming pool. We used the pool at least twice a day. Towels are provided poolside. If/when they run out of towels, you just have to ask the front desk and they'll quickly get more. The Vive bar: The welcome drinks were a nice added touch the first night; we made a habit of returning to the Vive bar for happy hour (5-7 pm) each evening before we headed out for dinner. Recommendations for restaurants and jazz clubs from Lauren and JT at the Vive bar and Pierre at the front desk were very helpful. All of the staff were incredibly friendly and helpful. In the mornings, a complementary breakfast is served in the bar area. It's a simple breakfast that includes an assortment of cereals, breads, muffins, juices, jams, etc. There are several coffees and teas to choose from. There was also a hot tray of bacon and sausages and a tray of cold hard-boiled-eggs. The breakfast staff (Amanda and others) quickly replaced items that were running low and cleared tables promptly. One thing that bothered me about the breakfast though was the amount of waste it generated that could have been recycled (e.g. single-serve jam jars, cereal boxes, juice bottles). Also a microwave in the breakfast area would be a nice added touch. Thoughts on traveling with kids: This hotel is best suited to couples and friends traveling together. We were a group of 6 adults and a 5-year old. The pool was entertaining enough for our son, but this is not a hotel that caters to families with kids. We ran into only one other child at the hotel during our 5-day stay. Never-the-less, the staff were all very friendly, kind, and welcoming to our son and we heard no complaints from anyone (guest or staff) about having him at the hotel with us. Thoughts on traveling with a larger group: We were a group of 7 occupying 3 rooms at the hotel. The hotel did a great job at accommodating our room requests and with providing us with recommendations on what we could do in New Orleans. Finding an inexpensive way to get to the hotel was a challenge. Taxis cost $14 per person each way. The airport shuttle was even more. For groups of 6 or more, we found out at the airport that a limo was the least expensive way to go and we could all travel as a group. Car rentals are very expensive for large vehicles and parking is expensive - we made out just fine without a vehicle in the French Quarter. Most restaurants (I think ALL that we visited) automatically add a tip of 18% or 20% for groups of more than 5 or 6; this is ok if the service is good, but frustrating when it isn't. Overall: The points I've raised here are mostly for information... any negatives were very minor and didn't sway our overall opinion of the hotel.

The rooms, albeit small, were clean and modern, but also had the lovely laid back Nawlins' charm. Bathroom was small as well, but not cramped. The hotel was definitely good value for money, and a great base for our trip. +++: Location: In my eyes, the location was perfect. It was an easy walk to almost everything we wanted, and in a beautiful part of the French Quarter. Close to entertainment venues, dining and drinking options, convenience stores, public transportation - basically everything a tourist needed. Rooms: Charming decor with comfortable double beds. In room amenities were perhaps a little lacking, but thoughtful. For example, they provided plastic cups in case we wanted to take a drink from our room out into the street, but they felt a little cheap. Bar / Service: The in-house bar was a good place for a get-the-night-started drink, especially since the hotel provided us each with a coupon for one standard drink. The bartender was friendly and mixed great drinks. Front desk and cleaning staff were courteous and congenial. ---: Minor cleanliness / renovation issues: During our stay, the hotel continued with their refurbishment. This was not a very major deal, just the sporadic \"wet paint\" sign, as well as the hallway smelling of paint for the whole day. Fortunately the smell did not seep into our room. Also, while the room was generally clean, there was a small live cockroach that scuttled across our floor, of which I promptly disposed of. This was the only bug in the room I found, but I was definitely more wary of the room's cleanliness after finding it. Room size and lack of curtains: Fairly small, but not cramped. Enough space for luggage and hanging up some clothes, but it was quite a cozy stay. Also, there are blinds, but not curtains, which means that natural flight will seep into the room once the sun rises. Probably was not the best for someone who was trying to sleep off a hangover.

There isn't a restaurant, so there's no room service, but they offer complimentary continental breakfast, which is lovely. Since you're in the heart of the French Quater-- you really don't miss the restauarant anyway. There are tons of places to eat-- just steps away from the hotel. The only bad thing I would say is that if there are people in the hallway-- you can absolutely hear their voices. I had tried to take a nap at some point, and had a tough time sleeping, since the people in the hallway were so loud.

Now we had to limit our options as not all hotels have twin rooms (2 beds). We would have opted to stay elsewhere if this was not an issue. That said, le Marais had mostly good reviews and so we opted to stay there. So a few things that might help others. We had a room facing the main street; there was little to no street noise. There is some from the hallway and the room walls are thin. Still, I am a pretty light sleeper and with ear plugs, I was fine. The rooms themselves are fine in size. Two people could manage without feeling cramped. Usual amenities. There were quite a few notes about the shower and water spraying in to the bathroom. This is so not an issue. You just need to turn the shower head slightly away from the entry point and you will be fine. It is not a completely open space, it has a glass division, it just does not have a door that closes so where you enter and leave is open but really, with a bath mat in front of this and a slight turn, we had no issues. There is a safe, iron and ironing board and bottles of water they leave. There is free wifi that worked in the rooms and public areas. The breakfast in the morning is fine, not stellar but fine. Usually some bacon, with some form of eggs, then bagels or bread you can toast, cereals, yoghurt and coffees and juices. It is a self serve and you can eat in the bar area or outside. We did have drinks in the bar at night, bartender was nice (great music) and you can find a seat inside or out. The location is great. Very close to the French Quarter and if this is your first trip to NOLA, the FQ is not a bad choice. The hotel was far enough from Bourbon street (which really is just such a tourist, ugly trap) so you can enjoy being central but not that central. The only let down of the hotel was the front desk staff. They were indifferent at best. Upon check in and as well asking some advise, they were just not interested. There is no concierge so you rely on them and this is the main weakness of the hotel. For this reason and teh general warmth of the NOLA folks, I would stay elsehwere. As well, this is a trendy (attempting) hotel and when you are in NOLA, I think getting a taste of NOLA is better. This is not NYC, so why do a boutique, trendy hotel when in the heart of the south unless you prefer this. I think the next time, if I want this kind of hotel, I will try the International and if not, a bit of a larger B&B. I gave it 4 stars as the interior and location and upkeep are fine. But if I were to add it all up; it would really be more like a 3.5.

The room was pretty similar to the ones pictured on the website minus the decorative pillows and such. It was gorgeous. I did not get a room with a view but that wasn't much of a concern to me. This hotel is less than a block away from Bourbon Street. The perfect location. It was so close that we would go back and forth just to put things away or to use the restroom various times of the night. I did not hear any noise from Bourbon Street. A few other members commented on the shower. They are correct that it does not have a shower door but I just put a towel down and it was fine. The walls are thin but nothing that you can't ignore. The breakfast was great and had a variety of selections. The beds were very comfortable. Check out time is at noon and were expecting, like most hotels, to be able to leave around 1-2 pm. Well not so much. I assume this is due to the hotel being constantly booked. The front desk called a few minutes after 12 to see if we were ready to go. Once we got downstairs we realized there were 5 people waiting to check in. Our flight didn't leave until 9 pm and Pierre offered to hold our luggage and have a car ready for us when we returned. He kept his word. We returned to our hotel with our luggage and car ready. One thing to know is that this hotel charges an incidental fee of $50.00 per night when you check out. I got home and checked my account and noticed an additional $100.00 on my credit card. I called the hotel and they assured me the charge would drop off in a few days, which it did. I loved everything about this hotel and highly recommend it to anyone visiting NOLA.", "Date": "April 4, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Philadelphia, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cPleasant stay near Bourbon street\u201d", "Author": "natalie n", "ReviewID": "UR127100425", "Content": "Stayed for two nights last month ...

We appreciated the drinks at check-in and the perfectly adequate continental breakfast, which included cold cereal, instant oatmeal and grits, hard boiled eggs, yogurts, fruit, bread and pastries. The real scene-stealer is the lovely modern and elegant courtyard patio and pool. The pool is small but it didn't stop our kids from swimming. And since this hotel is small itself (I think 64 rooms?), it never felt crowded. Lovely front desk staff. We would return to this hotel. Oh, one note about noise: we were on the Conti side and we could hear the Bourbon street partying at night. Two of us didn't notice the noise, the other two slept with earplugs (which we always travel with, since we are sensitive to sound).

I ended up going to Starbucks each day to send emails and do research. The Bathroom doesn't have shower curtain or door which makes the bathroom floor very wet. You need a lot of towels to soak it up. The last evening when we were packing I checked under the bed and found one used towel that wasn't ours and hamburger wrappers.

The free breakfast was better than most, offering not just the usual dry goods, but eggs, bacon, and sausage as well! This was a great way to wake up after a night out on the town.

Especially after watching a friend deal with check in at her hotel the St. Marie and they were completely unorganized, and absolutely rude to everyone who was upset at the front desk because their rooms were all messed up. I watched for several hours in the lobby one incident after another. So I found even more appreciation for the great staff at the front desk at my hotel. The lobby was so incredibly cute. All colorful with blue, purple and pink lighting inside and outside. Let me just tell you how nice that is when you stumble into your hotel at 5am completely [--] faced. The cute bar was a good start for a start out drink, bartender was kewl and friendly just like everyone we encountered at the hotel. By far this will be where I stay every time I go back to New Orleans.

I've vacationed in NOLA a dozen & a half times in the past 10 years, so I know a lot about the various hotel properties. This is a 66-room hotel, centrally located French Quarter that has undergone a major re-do within the last year. (I remember it as the St. Anne that went belly-up after Katrina). The bedrooms are small & the baths are even tinnier, but both have stylish appointments, considering the limited space they had to work with. The hotel has only 6 rooms that sport balconies, so good luck at trying to get one of these. The complimentary breakfast offered was adequate with the basics, plus eggs, bacon & sausage. Nice enclosed courtyard with a small heated saltwater pool, although I thought the weather too cool to use it, & lush, tropical landscaping. The hotel is immaculately clean, however the maid skipped me one day & I had to complain. The front desk instantaneously had my room attended to & couldn't have been more accommodating when any request was made. Only had a few issues with the hotel, as I'm a meticulous guest & want the most out of my vacation. 1) There's only one slow moving elevator in a 5-story building that's used for everything. 2) Plastics disposable cups are in the bathroom -very Holiday Inn Express, in an otherwise elevated atmosphere. 3) Lack of balconies, as mentioned above. 4) Bar supports need to be installed for safety in the showers, as the black marble tiles get slippery. 5) Lastly, the hotel facade is too modest & needs some pizzazz -to emphasize the \"wow\" that's going on inside.

I had to change our reservation details several times, and the reservations folks were very understanding and accommodating. - Location: One of the primary reasons we stayed here was to be in the heart of the French Quarter, and not have to walk back to canal street at the end of the night. This place is in a perfect spot, central to everything. - Value: The price we paid per room ($161/night) was well worth it when you factor in everything you get with it. Free high speed internet, free bottled water, free REAL breakfast (delicious, eggs, bacon, ham, etc, etc), complimentary drinks when you check in. I was very impressed with all of this. - Condition: I am very picky about a hotel being in good condition, and this place was basically perfect. The hallways, the rooms, the common areas, how the hotel smells, the gym, EVERYTHING was like it was brand new. Fresh and clean. It has a nice modern vibe to it, with all of the nice luxury touches such as Grohe bathroom fixtures, premium bedding, boutique soaps and shampoo, etc. I would totally recommend this hotel to any of my friends and family, and definitely stay here again. It hits on all the right points, and is nice and clean, comfortable, and has a great blend of luxury and value.", "Date": "August 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, clean and authentic new orleans\u201d", "Author": "Prancer85", "ReviewID": "UR115954552", "Content": "This place was great!

Check-in took about 2 minutes, and front desk was very welcoming. The room was not huge, but just right. Room appointings were all very lovely, and bathroom was nice. Best part of the room: BED! SOOOO SUPER COMFY! I slept like a rock every night, although my husband said he heard partiers on the street below (we were on the 5th floor) on the wknd nights in the wee hours, but I didn't hear a thing. The front desk/concierge was always very nice and accommodating. My only recommendation for them is the learn more the 'local' places to make recommendations. But the hotel location was perfectly accessible to everything we did! Even when we were ready to avoid the bourbon street scene. The welcome cocktail was a very nice touch, and we found ourselves having drinks at the bar other nights as well. The continental b'fast was just right, although the 'hot' food (i.e., scrambled eggs) was put out only on weekends. we enjoyed our b'fast every morning outside in the courtyard, which was nice both morning and night. THe reason I only gave a 4 for cleanliness was as follows: When we arrived, the room was impeccable. However, over our 4 day stay we noted that they did not change our sheets (at least 3 of the nights anyways), and even made our bed with the newspaper tucked b/w the sheets that my husband had read that morning. they should have checked and thrown it out. Also, a coffee mug I had brought up from breakfast was left on the TV table for 2 nights! It was in plain sight--should have been taken away. Mostly, these are minor kinks that this new hotel should/can work out.

I called the hotel directly to reserve the room and reserved one of the non-refundable, advance purchase rooms. The week of the wedding came around and I received a phone call from the hotel 3 days before the wedding. I was told the hotel was overbooked and I was being sent to a hotel near the airport. If anyone has been to New Orleans, you know this is far and not a convenient location. I expressed my dissatisfaction and was told all that they could do is send me there or cancel my reservations. I even spoke to the manager at the time and was told there was nothing else that could be done. They proceeded to tell me that the city was booked and airport accommodations was all that was available for the weekend. I reluctantly canceled my reservations and panicked about finding a room for the weekend. Miraculously, I found an available room in the french quarter within 5 minutes of my search. If I was able to find a room, why wasn't the employee searching for accommodations able to find it. The room was located at the Sheraton so it wasn't an economy location. I am angered because I wasn't offered anything for the inconvenience nor the extra money I had to spend for a last minute available room. The customer service concerning this incident was very poor. I have read the recent reviews and would love to have a nice experience with the hotel. However, this one experience was a nightmare and I would hate for anyone else to have to go through. It may have been a computer glitch that caused the problem but management could have offered a little more for the trouble that they caused.

Around Feb-Mar we started seeing some bad reviews show up saying people had been turned away after booking months in advance. Naturally I was completely freaked out by this - we'd been looking forward to our trip for so long and had saved up for it. Fortunately, we worried for nothing! I emailed (and tweeted) the hotel a few times prior to our trip and was assured we'd be fine. Still, I worried. We showed up at the hotel on Friday morning around 11am. There was a TINY snag when our friends got assigned an already occupied room (woops!) but other than that everything was wonderful. Our rooms were ready promptly, were clean and quiet and safe. This was our first time staying in the French Quarter (previously stayed in the CBD) and we worried it might be noisy but despite being right off of Bourbon Street, this hotel is super quiet! The hotel is newly renovated and is gorgeous in a modern boutique hotel style. Upon check-in you are given a coupon for a free drink at the hotel bar and all of the staff members are friendly and helpful. Pierre at the front desk was a big help to our group - offering restaurant suggestions and best taxi routes when we headed uptown. The beds are giant and super comfortable - I slept like the dead every night (although I may have had help from Pat O'Brian's hurricanes). You also get complimentary bottle of water in your room (hard to find hotels that don't charge you $8 a bottle these days!) and my husband and I even got a complimentary box of pralines in our room! THANK YOU Hotel staff! There is also a large flat screen tv (we hardly turned it on..hellooo, not on vacation to watch tv!) and an ipod dock in case you wanted to listen to some tunes while you get ready for the day. There is a jar of free ginger snap cookies at the front desk should you feel snacky while you wait for your taxi. The wifi in the hotel can be spotty at times but works well for the most part. We usually went out (or slept through) breakfast but we did eat at the hotel twice and I can say I haven't seen such a fantastic free breakfast spread at any hotel I have ever stayed at. Fresh fruit, Community brand coffee, yogurt, cereal, delicious crispy real bacon, sausage patties, all manner of breads and bagels and english muffins, scrambled eggs..EVERYTHING! All for free! We appreciated this very much on our check out day as we had to be at the airport early. The hotel also boasts a nice little quiet courtyard with pool. The courtyard is gorgeous but we did not use the pool as it was soooooo hot in New Orleans when we were there and the pool is a heated saltwater pool. Who cares though, we didn't come to New Orleans to swim! I bet that pool would be fantastic in Feb-March! The location is great as well, nestled just off of Bourbon street yet very very quiet. Since this was not our first time in New Orleans we did not go to Bourbon street but still found the location ideal for everything we wanted to see and do. All in all I would definitely stay at the Hotel Le Marais again and would recommend it to anyone.

I had a lower level, courtyard facing room, but during the day, it was still bright, and even though by night there were music and the courtyard was lit, I never heard a thing.

My room had 2 double beds and although small was comfortable and no problems moving around. They did a very nice job using the space. The room was clean and the bed way too comfy. Given the hotel is about a quarter block from bourbon is was really pretty quiet. The staff was very pleasant and attentive. When I called down about a couple charges on my credit card that shouldn't have been there, they made the necessary phone calls and had everything resolved in 15 minutes! The continental breakfast is very simple but worked for me. Its in the bar area so if a mass group of folks came in for breakfast there wouldn't be places for folks to sit, but during my stay it wasn't a problem. Recommend enjoying your coffee and danish by the pool. Its tiny(you won't be doing laps) but nice if you want a dip and a very peacefil courtyard setting. I thought the workout room was adequate. Its small but it had a couple of aerobic machines, free weights and a nautilas set..you can certainly work up a sweat. I have a couple suggestions based on my stay. 1) Rooms with shutters over the windows should also have a curtain, shade or something to better block out the light. I couldn't really get the room dark and since most visiting are probably keeping late hours, that dark room is great for catching the late morning Zs. 2) The bathroom is cute but not user friendly if being shared. No shower curtain or door means no privacy and a lot of water gets out on the floor.

Expedia confirmed our reservations on two occasions prior to our April departure.

To quote the email, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153 Unfortunately we are unable to accept your reservation for the Hotel Le Marais for your stay (which we had made and was confirmed 4 months prior) . However, the hotel has made alternate accommodations for you.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd In a panic we researched the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153alternate accommodations.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The \u00e2\u20ac\u0153alternate\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd hotel was 35 miles outside of New Orleans and had multiple reviews to the effect of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stay here unless you like bed bugs, cockroaches, and drug deals in the parking lot.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd After spending two hours on the phone with Expedia (which we will never use again) it became clear that there were no accommodations available at the last minute in New Orleans due to the popularity of the very festival that we had planned to attend. That ended our long awaited 40th anniversary celebration. In addition we lost our non-refundable $800.00 airfare. As a result I strongly suggest that if you are planning a trip to New Orleans, avoid The Hotel Le Marais (if you actually want to have a room when you arrive) and stay away from Expedia and hotels.com as they \u00e2\u20ac\u0153have no control\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd as to whether the hotel reservations that you made with them, and that they confirmed, will actually have a room available once you arrive \u00e2\u20ac\u201c or as in our case, hours before you leave for the airport.", "Date": "April 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Salt Lake City, Utah", "Title": "\u201cHonest Explanation but more over a really nice hotel\u201d", "Author": "LondonMidnight", "ReviewID": "UR104838562", "Content": "I had read all the reviews before I chose to book this location, the first few were great and than came the bad reviews about overbooking.

It was her first experience in N.O.L.A. So I wanted to be a great host to her and show her why I love the N.O.L.A. so much. I have family from New Orleans that told me that the St. Ann Marie Antoinette had been renovated and changed to a different name. I had heard the new property was modern and a buzz was zipping around about how nice and cozy this boutique hotel was. I had to stay at the Hotel Le Marais. Upon arrival, we found out that we were bumped out of our room. In fact there were a few other guests experiencing the same problem. Being it was a busy time of the year, the management at the Hotel Le Marais sent a couple people to their sister property at the airport. We could have stayed at the Dauphine. Although it certainly was not my plan, I decided that the airport was 30 minutes away, not including traffic, and not near the Downtown, French Quarter/Bourbon Street areas. Unlike the others, I had an option. I have family that after Hurricane Katrina, relocated to Metairie, Mandeville and Gentilly right outside of New Orleans, and Thibodaux (near Baton Rouge) about an hour away from New Orleans. I decided to go and stay with family. I felt worse for the people who were in my same situation, but did not have anyone in town to stay with. My friend was so upset and I have to admit, I was disappointed too. I wanted to stay near all of the action, the restaurants and nightlife. Staying with family was not a horrible option, but not part of the original plan. I can not say much about the hotel, because I did not get to stay there, see the rooms or experience what it would be like as a guest. I will say that there was something good that came out of this. I had the chance to meet the front desk staff and I have to say that Tania and most importantly Daffne (who I think is the Reservations or Front Desk Manager). They were so apologetic and most of all very accommodating. Daffne actually asked that we 'give the Hotel Le Marais' another chance if we ever come back to New Orleans. She handled the situation so well, that I will take her up on that. I cannot speak for my friend, but I surely will give this hotel and 2nd chance.

That really didn't matter much, just found it strange. Also, I cannot say enough nice things about the staff at this hotel. My boyfriend and I had an unfortunate situation where the credit card we brought to hold to room had been compromised and shut down upon check in, so we were facing significant charges to use debit (charges that would be refunded within a week of checkout, but that was still money we couldn't use in New Orleans). The staff was so patient with us and when we got it all figured out, they provided us with a complimentary upgrade to make sure our trip didn't start off on a negative note. The room was great, beds were very comfortable and huge. Bathroom was great, shower was unique in that it had half of a glass partition, rather than a curtain, so it's almost fully exposed. My friends and I want to make this a yearly tradition and will most certainly return to this hotel. Went at the end of February, so we got the Mardis Gras experience without it actually being Mardis Gras- great time overall!!", "Date": "March 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Appleton, Wisconsin", "Title": "\u201cLovely Hotel in the French Quarter\u201d", "Author": "peace_love_midwest", "ReviewID": "UR99191765", "Content": "My husband & I had the pleasure of staying at the Hotel Le Marais for three nights last week for our first trip to New Orleans. I had read multiple reviews here on Trip Advisor recommending the hotel and we were not at all disappointed. The hotel is located on Conti Street, only a half block from Bourbon and a few blocks from Jackson Square. Staying here puts you within reach of all the beautiful sights, sounds, smells (okay, some of the smells on Bourbon Street wouldn't exactly be described as beautiful, but they are part of the experience), and tastes of the French Quarter. The staff was incredibly welcoming, helpful, and friendly. Upon check-in we were told about the Continental Breakfast and the warm, saltwater pool in the courtyard. We were given two free tickets for drinks at the hotel bar--a very nice touch! I believe the hotel recently underwent a major renovation, and all of the hard work that was put into the project definitely shows. The lobby was clean, modern, and trendy (without being intimidating or obnoxious) and our room was equally impressive--clean, with modern decor & furnishings, a super-comfortable bed, and a flat screen tv. For our gadgets, there was an i-pod dock on the alarm clock and FREE Wi-Fi throughout the hotel (rare to be free, but definitely appreciated!) The bathroom was spotless. Our particular room on the third floor had a view of the beautiful courtyard and was amazingly quiet, even with the craziness of Bourbon Street being so close. The morning we checked out, the front desk arranged to have a cab waiting for us. We hated to leave at all but it was nice to not have to hail down a cab on the street. It might be of interest to note that there were no hidden costs or fees tacked on to our bill (as that does happen, unfortunately, at some hotels.) I think the Hotel Le Marais is an incredible value--the quality of the hotel, combined with the kind staff and great location will ensure that you have a great stay. We fell in love with New Orleans and its awesome people. We will be looking forward to coming back and staying at the Hotel Le Marais again!", "Date": "March 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego, California", "Title": "\u201creservation meaningless\u201d", "Author": "mk2me", "ReviewID": "UR99157319", "Content": "I booked our room on the hotel website on 12/5/11, then recommended to our friends who subsequently booked with the hotel website and got the same rate and same room type.

Our friends, who had booked after us, got no such voicemail. We all arrived together around 7pm and were anxious to get our rooms and enjoy the first parade which had already started. They checked in without issue. Then we were told that was the last room and we could go to the Bourbon Orleans for the same rate and then return the next day for the 2nd and 3rd nite. I asked how it was determined that our room was given up before someone who reserved after us. No good explanation was received. The Bourbon Orleans is a related property which I never would have chosen. They barely were able to get us a room since they were full too. We got a room on the top floor with no room number and it smelled horrible, was dirty and extremely dated, this after having to walk several blocks thru the crowds with our luggage. Hotel Le Marais eventually comped us that room, but only after my repeated complaints and insistence that they do so. Once back at Hotel Le Marais we enjoyed the brand new rooms which is why we reserved there. We received a standard room when I would have thought they would upgrade us for all of the inconvenience.

When were arrived at the hotel on Saturday (2/12/11) we (and a lobby full of a dozen angry patrons) were told that they had completely overbooked the hotel and no longer had rooms for any of us. We sat in the lobby for a little over an hour without any clarity on how the staff woud handle the situation. Repeated requests by those in the lobby to speak with management were declined. After much prodding we were moved to a nearby French Quarter hotel. After a long day of travel, missing our afternoon pre-race warm-up runs and fighting with the hotel staff all afternoon, we arrived at our new hotel which was small and filthy. Exhausted and hungry, we decided to leave the situation for the following day (after the race). Hotel staff had given me the general manager's t contact information and I sent a very civil email asking to arrange a time on Sunday to chat about being displaced. After finishing the marathon on Sunday, we called Hotel le Marais and let them know we would like to return there if they had a room for us - they had told us that we could spend our remaining two nights there when we left the day before. They said they'd have a room ready in about an hour (at 3pm). I asked if that was guaranteed. They said it was not - we would have to check at 3pm. We called at 3pm. They did not have a room for us, but might in another hour. At that point, having not received a reply from the manager and being given the run-around about getting a new room (and having spent the night in a filthy hotel), I called Orbitz's customer service (where I spent over an hour trying to see if they had any help to offer - they did not). Around five we called back to Hotel Le Marais - it was unclear whether they would have a room for us. So we went over to the hotel in person, and were finally given a room. I let the staff know that I'd still like to chat with the manager if possible (since the front desk staff had told us on Saturday that they were not able to offer anything in the form of reimbursement/compensation). They said he would be in on Monday morning and asked if I'd like to set a time for him to call me. We agreed on 11am. The next morning 11am came and went without hearing from the manager. I checked in multiple times and was told he was in meetings all day. The head of housekeeping informed me later in the day that he had actually been in earlier, but had not reached out to me. In the evening the front desk manager (who had not identified herself as someone who could solve problems on Saturday) asked me what we would like done to make this situation right. While I appreciated her effort, the time to ask that question was on Saturday, not Monday evening. I let her know that what I would like was 3 nights complementary (since that's how many we had paid for) in the future where I could come back and enjoy their hotel without disruption (having to be sent to a filthy hotel, be given the runaround with the staff, spend my Sunday waiting until I had a room to move in and trying to contact management that never showed up, etc.). She said this seemed like a reasonable request and would check with the manager. My wife sent a more extensive email to the general manager, with no response. Later that evening I received an email from the front desk saying they were \"more than gladly\" to offer me ONE complimentary night at Hotel Le Marais in the future. I'm unclear as to why I would come back to New Orleans for one night, or pay additional money to stay at a hotel where I have no confirmation of their desire to put customers first, or that a room woud even be there for us. Mistakes are made and I tried to offer a solution that would allow them to remedy those mistakes. After a future undisturbed stay (one with quality customer service), I would have been more than happy to come on here and given Hotel Le Marais 5 stars. To have spent time every day that I stayed in New Orleans reaching out to the hotel staff to rectify this situation was ridiculous to say the least. It's unfortunate because it's a beautiful hotel. But it's not a cheap place to stay and in the future I'd spend my money somewhere that actually has customer service. I spent my last minutes in New Orleans on Tuesday morning that day with the front desk staff - who had told me the manager was coming... waiting for a manager who never showed up (while making my cab to the airport wait). I've reached out to the hotel staff since returning home, again to no response. My wife and I love to travel, and neither of us have ever experienced such poor customer service at a hotel, particularly when the business is at fault.

Overall a pretty great experience and i would stay again. The Hotel is clean, showers are great, TV\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s are new, free WIFI is available (which is rare for hotels, but shouldn't be) and the best thing is that it is right off of Bourbon Street, but quiet enough that you can have a great night sleep. My biggest complaint is that if I had not done a lot of research on restaurants and music, i probably would have been stuck on Bourbon Street the entire time without an idea of an outside world. I had asked the concierge about restaurants and i was directed to chains, and when i asked about authentic New Orleans BBQ i was directed to Applebee\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s or his mom's place (are you kidding me). For a boutique hotel, the staff need to be educated on restaurants for all classes of people, especially foodies like myself and inherited family. We want the best NOLA has to offer and the staff were clueless when it came to places like Cochon or August. They still have some finishing touches to put on the hotel, like tables in the bar area, but the bartender's personality (and outsanding mojitos) made up for lack of everything. One last comment which made me disappointed... the manager had boasted on this site before that they have the biggest hot tub in New Orleans, but failed to mention that is isn't open. One of the first posts here was a business man saying how he would have loved to go swimming in the pool that was open, which makes me think it was a fake post by management. This place is great, it doesn't have the charm of some older New Orleans hotels, but that also means it is probably a lot cleaner! Just make sure you do your homework about this great city before coming.", "Date": "January 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Goteed1", "Title": "\u201cBrand new and Good...but not great...yet\u201d", "Author": "Goteed1", "ReviewID": "UR92024811", "Content": "Stayed here during Christmas week and thought overall it's a really sweet little boutique hotel. This place could be GREAT but I think they still have some stuff to work out. The place is sleek and modern, \"mood\" lighting in the lobby (Think Virgin America's cabins and you'll get the idea) . Their standard room was larger than most standard rooms in the quarter. Very modern decor and finishes. Actually like a new Marriott or Hyatt. Very comfortable bed, lots of pillows, a nice sitting area by the window, FREE wifi. Bathroom is very modern too. I REALLY like the walk in shower. Very clever touch is the faucet for the shower is at the opposite side of the showerhead, so you don't get splashed with water trying to turn the shower on. Also they have an electronic \"Do not disturb\" signs which is a great touch. They have a nice bar in the lobby which opens on to the courtyard. When I was there they were still renovating the courtyard and it was way too cold to linger out there anyway. When the weather gets warm, this could be a nice nightspot. They advertise a \"state of the art\" gym. Um, no. It is no where near a state of the art Gym. It's a small fitness room with a couple of pieces of new equipment. Looks like it was not quite finished when I was there. Flatscreen TV was not working. (Shouldn't the cardio equipment actually face the TV?) Anyhow, for the very few of us that use a gym in New Orleans, you could get a decent workout here. They serve a very nice continental breakfast in a small conference room off the front lobby. Local coffee (Community Coffee) and some great fresh muffins (Still warm!) MUCH better than the usual Costco crap you get at other hotels. Also, no great hoards of starving people fighting for the last crumb of food here. But for the life of me, I can't figure why they dont put this spread out in the nice bar area instead of a cramped little conference room??? My one big issue which with the place is the hot water. I had to run the tap for a good 20 minutes before I had warm water. When I asked about this at the front desk, I was told that when the hotel fills up the pipes get more use so the hot water comes faster. HUH??? a 7 Million dollar renovation and you can't get hot water? Over the next day or so it got worse and finally no water pressure either. I went back down to the front desk and was told I'm the only one complaining. That really broke my heart. I wanted to love this place, but the guy obviously did not want to deal with me. Anyhow I persisted and told him to send someone up to look at my room. They did and the problem was fixed. (Although hot water still took a couple of minutes to come) For those traveling here by car, the hotel does not have a garage but contracts with a local garage that is a little bit away from the hotel, so during peak times, it will be quite a wait for your car. You'll need to call down and schedule it. Same with Valet service. Contracted only during peak times. There is no room service (no restaurant on site) But there are plenty of food options literally with a stone's throw from here. One last point that kept me from really loving the place totally... noise. NOT from Bourbon Street. They insulated the windows really well for that, but you can hear everything in the hallway and vice versa. I was right across from an elevator so I probably had more traffic by my room than most rooms, but it was a nuisance. (Ask for a room away from an elevator). Although I thinik they have done some really terrific work in the renovation, the place looks really sharp, I think they need to work out those plumbing issues soon.", "Date": "January 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "M\u00c3\u00bcnchen", "Title": "\u201cSplendid hotel - nice stay!\u201d", "Author": "angelapoech", "ReviewID": "UR91741866", "Content": "We were at the the Le Marais during a few day's visit in New Orleans and very much enjoyed the stay.

If you want to be in the heart of the French Quarter, in an elegant, comfortable and charming hotel with excellent service and hospitality, go no further. Hotel Le Marais is it. This is a boutique-style, classy hotel that has just undergone a complete renovation, from carpets to bathroom fixtures, to lobby furniture. In fact, when I arrived, they were putting finishing touches here and there. My overall experience here was wonderful. The rooms are very large and confortable and surprisingly quiet even though right in the French Quarter. My very comfy queen-size bed was superior in quality as was the giant new flat screen TV. The towels were plush and oversized, just great. My room was super clean, with that smellof being new. Another great thing about this hotel is its location. It was fantastic to be able to walk to famous Bourbon or Royale just down the street, find plenty of galleries, shops, the Legends of Music Park Cafe, Johnny's Po Boys, walk a bit further to Cafe du Monde and the French Market, and find jazz so close by the hotel. Location is 5 Stars too. The lovely and attentive staff at the front desk and elsewhere that I encountered, were all extremely helpful, very welcoming and accomodating with any and every question or request I had. The hotel Manager, Michael, could not have been more professional, attentive, and delightful to interact with during my stay. He and his staff not only made me feel welcomed in what was a new city for me, but made me feel special because of their real interest in making their guests feel comfortable and happy at the hotel Le Marais, their obvious pride and joy, a jewel of a New Orleans hotel. I highly recommend this hotel if you plan a business or family trip to New Orleans.
