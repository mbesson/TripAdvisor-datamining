When you pay only 60 Euros, I do not have high expectations. If you want a Marriot, pay the $200 Euros and enjoy the comfort.

Restaurants, bars and shopping in abundance all around. Two tapas bars, and Starbucks right next door. Cinema and Dunkin Donuts, LOTS of restaurants within five minute walk. We had a room on the 7th floor toward the back and it was perfectly quiet. Breakfast is not included, but who cares?

The bedding is extremely old and needs cleaning/updating. I went to the supermarket and sprayed all the bedding but it didn\u00b4t seem to hel\u00f1p much. Also the security for me was not good. The keys as mentioned in other reviews are old fashioned and need to be left at the reception and you tell them the room number when you come back to the hotel. The problem is that they give you any key without checking your name or questioning you.

But the hotel is good, despite not for those looking for luxury or immaculate services. The positives: The comfort is adequate; the bed and pillows are very good; the room is bigger than the average; the air condition is good and necessary, because you have to keep the double window closed due to the noise of the street (with it closed you hear nothing from streets); there is a small kitchen in the room which helps a lot to buy things in supermarkets; the bathroom is good, the desk staff is very gentle, despite a little unprepared. The negatives: There is no breakfast included and the hotel snack bar is not good, I recommend having the breakfast in other places or, better, to buy things in supermarkets and eat in the room (I recommend the \u201cEl Corte Ingles\u201d); the service is just adequate; the hotel seems a little old.", "Date": "January 8, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Delhi, India", "Title": "\u201cWarm, comfortable self sufficient stay at this aprtment hotel...\u201d", "Author": "Himjal", "ReviewID": "UR122097731", "Content": "The Staff at the hotel is very friendly & warm.

Now I have nothing against extreme budget travelers \u2013 I myself traveled this way on my first trip to Europe over 25 years ago. I have many happy memories of those salad days. If you find yourself in that category, I heartily recommend the Plaza de Espana, because it is a palace compared to some of the places I stayed back in the day. However, if, like me, somewhere over the years you \"graduated\" to the Marriott, Hilton or any of their international or boutique equivalents, you might want to consider staying at, um, one of those places. Good points: The staff was very friendly and helpful, making themselves understood despite the language barrier. The public areas and the room were clean. Room service is available and the rooms have kitchenettes, so you can prepare modest meals yourself. The rooms have a lovely view of the Plaza de Espana, and if you don't mind traffic noise, you can get some fresh air as the windows do open. The bathroom had a built in hairdryer and there was a safe in the closet. The television offerings included numerous Spanish networks, CNN, RTL (German network) and a station I think was in French. There is a computer with internet access in the lobby that is coin-operated: the price is competitive and you only pay for what you need. Downsides: The furnishings were quite modest \u2013 the bed was hard, the linens were cheap and somewhat worn (although clean). There was no clock, radio or combo thereof. I could not turn on the old, small television until an employee demonstrated the \"trick\" for getting it to work. The air conditioner wasn't working really well in my room (but see note above about the windows). In general, there was a rundown feeling about the place. Security note: The hotel still uses actual keys for the room with a huge keyfob that has the hotel name and room number on it \u2013 unlike the more discreet unmarked key cards that are common today. Also, the hotel is only half a block from the Metro station, but a building between the station and the hotel is being renovated (as of July 2008). Pedestrians have to walk under a scaffolding that is dark and isolated \u2013 fine during the day, but security-minded patrons may want to take care after dark. Note: The hotel is now part of the Espahotel chain, which has five or six hotels in Madrid.", "Date": "July 15, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lawrence, New York", "Title": "\u201cdull hotel- you get what you pay for\u201d", "Author": "yodalia", "ReviewID": "UR8036626", "Content": "Location: okay, but not great. Not so close to many sites but close to public transportation and city sightseeing buses. Room: the first room we were showed to reeked of smoke. We had asked for non-smoking so we switched. This room had a funny smell but after leaving the window open for a while the smell wore off. The room was nice sized, and had a little kitchenette. A/c worked well--important, as it was really, really hot in Madrid. The beds weren't so comfortable and the furniture was a bit run-down. But wasn't so surprised because the hotel was pretty cheap. Our only real problem was the reception. They were very nice and accommodating but they didn't know English. When we arrived, there was one person there who didn't know English, but the next morning there was one woman who did. Later when we returned, no one who knew English. A little annoying when we needed directions and other help, but they tried. Also, we saw a cockroach in the lobby. Was quite funny actually because the receptionist said, \"Cucaracha!!\" We all thought that was pretty humorous. Overall, would I stay there again?
