That said, the room, when air wasn't moving, smelled of stale smoke. This became glaringly apparent after our first day out of the room. The room types need to be better described, because what I thought was a \"suite\" was more like a normal hotel room with a mini kitchenette. The floor in the kitchenette was nice laminate wood-look, but while the carpet looked clean, it really wasn't. They really need to wash it. Two main reasons for staying here was the inclusion of a DVD player, so I could do video review (side business) while travelling. I couldn't get the thing to work (audio, but no video - no instructions in the room), and by the time I complained and maintenance came up (over 8 hours), it was too late for me to use this resource. By the way, to use it, tune TV to channel 3 (seriously, who does this anymore with flat screens? changing the source via menu doesn't work). Lastly, the \"hot tub\" wasn't very hot. It was barely about 10 - 20 degrees warmer than the pool, and on the last night we were staying, the heater was broken, resulting in about a 70 degree hot tub. I can't say it was worth it's price, but you may want to look around for a better alternative if you can find something for the price (aka, if you can get the Drury across the street for close to the price, do it).", "Date": "November 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Road Warrior", "Title": "\u201cLike Staying at A Kennel\u201d", "Author": "AlCzervik1", "ReviewID": "UR102829449", "Content": "Oh boy where do I start off with this review. First off let me say that I like staying at this particular Interstate exit as its convenient to where I work when I'm in town. Last time I was in town I stayed at the Suburban Extended Stay hotel with is next door to the Candlewood Suites, both hotels are owned by the same company, Lee Hospitality. I had a bad experience there, see my review, thus I decided to try the Candlewood Suites instead as I figured it couldn't be worse..... it was. When I arrived at the hotel I was greeted with the nice aroma of fresh manure fertilizer that was spread on the plants surrounding the hotel. Little did I know once I actually got inside the room that the manure smell was a welcome relief from the horrendous stink that was in the room itself. The room smelled like old, rotten food and feet, ingrained in the carpet, drapes, etc from thousands of travelers cooking smelly foods. I immediately went out and bought 3 air fresheners which masked the smell enough to make the place habitable. This is a pretty typical older Candlewood, very basic, that's why these are budget hotels. I mainly booked it for the kitchen as these hotels have a cooktop, full sized fridge and dishwasher. Everything was going pretty well the first couple of nights then directly across the hall someone checked in with two dogs that had severe separation anxiety. The owners left around 7am and that's when the barking started, NONSTOP, constant, relentless barking/yapping. After about 3 hours I was getting irritated, after 5 hours I was livid and after 12 hours I was about ready to shoot myself. I had a lot of work to get done, which involves number crunching but could not concentrate at all, they could easily use that as a torture method as after several hours I could tell I was entering some mental distress. So I went down to the front desk where the \"manager\" promptly did absolutely nothing, I wasn't even given the common decency of an apology, no apology and no recourse whatsoever. The barking was treated as nothing more then a joke and I basically just a nuisance to her, she would have been happy to have me checkout right then and leave. She obviously had absolutely ZERO customer service skills whatsoever. I attempted to contact the general manager but he was conveniently \"on vacation\"...lol...like I believed that. There was no regard for me whatsoever, I had no rights other then moving rooms at my inconvenience. Those people with the dogs should have been told to leave the hotel as many guests were irritated, not just me. Well, the owners finally came back around 7pm and walked the dogs for 5 minutes then headed back out, again the yapping started, more hours passed, more frustration for me, the suffering which started at 7am finally ended at 11pm. The barking only stopped the couple of minutes they were back beyond that it was like a non-stop record playing, no break, no relief, like the Energizer bunny they just kept on going and going. Finally decided to cut my hotel stay short and leave, screwing up my travel plans, the manager was more then happy to see me go I'm sure, she could have cared less. This has to be one of the worst run hotels I've ever seen and I've stayed in hundreds, absolutely zero professionalism. The hotel itself may have rated slightly better without the barking dogs but was still pretty rough. The Internets speeds were awful, couldn't even stream video. The shower was cold and the bed was hard. About the only positive thing was that the cleanliness was good. I've stayed in two Lee Hospitality properties and both were bad experiences, these people are extremely cheap, putting the bare minimum back into their hotels at the expense of the guests, they are pretty much the slumlords of the hotel industry. Bottom line avoid this hotel at all costs.", "Date": "April 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Southeast Kentucky", "Title": "\u201cVery Clean\u201d", "Author": "Roundabout41348", "ReviewID": "UR102780394", "Content": "My wife and I stayed here for two nights.

We were here a week while Hubby was working and it was a great experience. We loved the exchange DvD system with blockbuster movies at the front desk free of charge. The pool and hot tub area was very nice and quiet enclosed and indoors so while it rained a few days on our trip our children could still swim. This hotel was very pet friendly surprising by how nice and well kept it was. They had free washer and dryer service and though no breakfast on site we bought food at the local grocery store and the kitchen had everything we needed. The beds were comfortable but I would have preferred larger sleeping arrangements I am used to a California King bed at home and swear those were more double sized. Free Hi-Speed Internet, nice workout room. The area is about 20min from downtown but after touring Downtown was glad we choose a bit further back. I felt safe there it was quiet until Friday when Nascar fans came in for the Brickyard but overall we loved it and highly recommended the hotel to others. The front desk staff are very children and family friendly and the staff do only clean the rooms once a week if your staying more than four days so just exchange the linens at the front if you want more and they will give you what you need. My kids loved the cupboard the onsite store and it was very cheap and well done. You received a USA today each day you could go in there and just pick it up.

We did manage to sleep two adults, two five-year-olds, and an eight year old, however. The full kitchen was a nice perk. Necessary, too, as the only food option is the honor-system snacks off the tiny lobby. No restaurant on-site, although the area has plenty to choose from.
