Access to public transportation is a bit wanting but that will change as the Seattle LRT system is to be extended north.

I just returned home in mid-March from a three-night stay at this hotel, and would like to confirm the praises from previous reviewers. Everyone at the front desk was professional and helpful; you can tell they have a great team attitude, towards both the guests as well as one another. The staff is youthful and enthusiastic and you just feel good from the moment you walk in. I reserved a room with a king bed, microwave and refrigerator. I asked for a quiet room with a view and was delighted to be on the top floor with a great view of downtown Seattle. My room was spotless. The d\u00e9cor was comfortable, the room was spacious and the bathroom was recently remodeled, with nice tile and fixtures throughout. Towels are fluffy, linens are plush, and windows had blackout drapes plus nice sheers layered over them. It was a plus to have the refrigerator and microwave, because Whole Foods is just around the corner and I made a couple of grocery runs for late evening and early morning snacks. It appears the entire hotel is being upgraded, including the lobby, which they are in the process of remodeling and should be completed soon. This did not interfere with my comings and goings. In addition, if needed, there is a computer with a printer in the lobby to print your flight reservation or check emails. The location was perfect. I like to walk, and I was able to walk to the Space Needle, all throughout downtown and Pike Place Market several times during my stay. If you don\u2019t care to walk, you can catch the bus routes, which are very close to the hotel; just ask the staff where you would like to go.

One of the reasons we booked this hotel was because it offered free parking in a secure garage with surveillance cameras... but that turned out to be a total nightmare! On the second night of our stay, someone hit our rental car which was parked in the hotel's garage and left a huge dent. When we asked the front desk to see the footage from the surveillance cameras, we were told that the cameras only face the entrance, exit, and elevator, NOT THE CARS, so we were not able to identify the person who damaged our car. On the third night, we weren't even able to park in the garage because it was completely full (they have very limited parking spaces, a whole lot less than they have rooms), so the front desk told us to park on the street until 10PM then move to the garage that belonged to the restaurant across the street from the hotel. This ended up ruining our plans for the night since we wanted to leave our car at the hotel and take a cab downtown. In addition, on New Years Eve night people were throwing confetti canisters down from their balconies and hitting the cars parked in the handicap spaces below, right in front of the entrance to the hotel. They made loud thumping noises as they hit the cars and one of the canisters almost hit me. We told the front desk about it, and they said, \"Yeah, we know.

Maybe a 15 minute walk to the Pikes Place market - and it's a nice walk as long as you avoid one or two shady blocks nearby (namely the one with the strip club on it).

I am not equipped to make comparisons. That being said, I was traveling with my two sisters and our elderly mother. Mom\u2019s ability to ambulate varies depending on the day and how much she\u2019s been on her feet. By the end of the day she is very unsteady and uses walking sticks. We brought along her handicap placard just for that reason and to make the trip as easy on her as possible. We popped back into the hotel one lunch time to regroup before heading back out. All of the handicap places in front were taken; one by the hotel manager (who is not \u2013 by the way \u2013 disabled). That was irritating but perhaps she just needed to grab something quick? At the end of the day when we returned, the manager\u2019s car was still parked in one of the two handicap places in front of the hotel. When I went in to inquire, Mirasol (a sweet, helpful receptionist) said that the car would be moved right away. We parked illegally in the street waiting. After a few more minutes my sister ran in to see when \u201cright away\u201d would be. After quick discussion, Mirasol offered to move the manager\u2019s car for her; which she did; although we were advised we could park in the parking garage instead. After parking and getting Mom in the hotel, I asked to speak to the manager who was not at all apologetic, but a bit testy stating that there were no parking spaces when she\u2019d come to work at 7:00 a.m. Apparently, she\u2019d parked there for the entire day. By profession I am an advocate for elderly and disabled persons. This sat very poorly with me. While parking was indeed free, the spaces in the garage that we did use the next day were extremely narrow and judging by the marred walls, we were not the only ones challenged to pull in and out. The hotel rooms were nice; equipped with a microwave and fridge. Breakfast was okay. Best feature was that the Whole Foods store was only a block away and we food some very good eating bargains there. Our last night at the hotel we shared the hallway with very rowdy young men running back and forth from two rooms; yelling, letting the doors slam, etc. The evening manager had already warned them and warned them again after we called. They quieted until about 2:30 a.m. when they started up again. I do believe the staff would have had them removed had I called again, but I figured that would be an even noisier proposal so I just tried to sleep through it as best as possible.

Everything seemed to be in good working order. Didn't see anything in terms of cleanliness that grossed us out. Mini fridge and microwave was great. It was quiet. Check in/check out was a breeze. Great location - a couple blocks or so from the downtown core. The Not so Good: I am extremely allergic to feathers. So feather pillows and/or duvets will trigger an asthma attack.

So not a huge deal (you get what you pay for). The kids seemed to enjoy making their waffles! Other than that, there was just some yogurt and fruit and cereal.

I jumped out of bed to answer it, dreading some kind of horrible urgent news, only it was a pleasant recording informing me that this is my wakeup call. But we had not requested one. \u201cWhat's going on?\u201d my husband's sleepy voice asked. And our two young children began to roll in their bed, and rubbing their eyes. So I dialed the front desk to find out. \u201cYour wake up call service just called our room at six, except we didn't request this wakeup call!\u201d I announced the complain in my most irritated quiet voice. \u201c....I didn't do it.\u201d the voice on the other end said. What kind of answer is this?! I found out that the voice belongs to Aldrich. \u201cWell, who did?\u201d I had to go along. \u201c...let's see...the person before my shift...could be Cory,\u201d Aldrich. This surprised me even more that his first reply. I had not expected Aldrich to actually produce a prime suspect for me. It is too early to keep this going. \u201cActually, I don't care if it is you or Cory, don't you think you should apologize to me?\u201d I opted to suggest the most entry level customer service etiquette to Aldrich. \u201cWould you like to speak with my manager?\u201d Aldrich asked me. \u201cWhy?\u201d wondering why he didn't just issue me an apology. \u201cBecause you sound upset,\u201d Aldrich dryly stated his reason. I declined Aldrich's invitation. Because I much rather go back to sleep. At 9AM, I decided to see if another hotel representative might like to apologize to me. Marisol was equally unapologetic, plus a tense and defensive face, minus the humor that Aldrich unwittingly indulged. The conversation with Marisol mostly consisted with a series of possible excuses to explain how none of this is anyone's fault. The most interesting excuse is that their wake up call system will sometimes just randomly call and wake guests up. Marisol assured me that it only happens about once every 3 months, plus the one time, when their phone system kept call this one room everyday for no reason. She said they are machines, so mistakes can happen with machines. Actually, by this point, I had my own suspect in mind. If it is intentional, it had to be the person that checked me in the previous day. I think her name is Yesenia. We wanted to check in early, and was told the room would be ready by 1:45PM. Well, we didn't check in until a little after 3PM. Yesenia reminds me of someone who has been in the service industry for too long, and is so jaded, that she harbors a disdain for anyone walking around with luggages. She was unfriendly and rude. As I finally got my room card key, I couldn't hold it in anymore, and I told her that she could be nicer. Later that evening, my husband picked up the phone and called the front desk, and requested a 9AM wake up call. We did this just to avoid another potential 6AM call. Their menacing wake up call rang our room again at 6AM! I kid you not! FURIOUS!! MAD!! I dialed the front desk again. Somehow my furor toned down a bit when I heard Aldrich's voice on the other end again. He needed to be dealt in a different way. \u201cAldrich, Cory woke us up again.\u201d I informed Aldrich. At least this time, he came up with a slightly more appropriate response. \u201cOH NO!\u201d Aldrich. I asked Aldrich to tell his hotel management about this and went back to bed. Later that day, we left at 11AM, and came back to our room a little after 5PM. Our room had not been cleaned. So we called the front desk to request our room cleaned and for new towels. They told us that housekeeping has left for the day. We were excited that we were leaving this hotel the next day at 5:30AM for an early morning flight. If you are someone who like to pay $185 a night (tax included) for a small and outdated room, managed by 3rd world country motel operators, then this place is a special heaven for you.

We are on an around the country road trip with our dog so we've stayed in lots of places recently. La Quinta's are often our first choice because of their pet-friendly policies.

But this one has a good downtown location. It's possible to walk to many places of interest from the hotel. One of the biggest bonuses is free parking. Every other hotel I checked had at least a $35 a day parking fee. Another bonus is the very friendly and helpful staff. They even gave our pup a treat bag. We stayed in a one bedroom suite which had a nice view of downtown and the Space Needle. The living room area was spacious but the bedroom was small. This was not a problem because of the spaciousness of the other room plus there was a pretty decent closet. The largest negative to this suite is that there is no air conditioning unit in the bedroom-there is just a small fan on the dresser--the only a/c unit is in the living room. It wasn't a big problem for us because the weather was not too hot, but in hot weather this could be a problem. The bathroom was small and could use some updating--the tub floor had a crack in it.

They had the typical La Quinta items -- cold cereal, waffles, biscuits & gravy, fruit, yogurt bagels, toast, etc. There were a few negatives, although minor in my opinion. First, the elevators are slow. We quit waiting for them and just used the stairs. Also, the free parking was tight as the hotel seemed full. We had to really squeeze into some spots. However, I don't blame the hotel, but other patrons who didn't know how to park between the lines. They would instead take two stalls to park. Also, the hotel is old and appears to be a purchased property that was converted into La Quinta. But I feel that they have done a great job of remodeling the building to make it very pleasant considering the age of the building. Another great thing is the business/internet center where you could use the internet and print for free. Most of the \"upscale\" hotels charge for this service, yet La Quinta allows it for free.

Our cousins were coming into Seattle for a night or two so we decided to head to Seattle to visit them. We checked to see if we had enough points for a free night in one of the La Quinta properties. Well, we had enough to stay in Federal Way (which is a very clean, very nice, newer property), but not quite enough to stay in the top-tier hotel in downtown Seattle. So, we decided to pay extra to stay in the downtown Seattle location and we prepared for a very nice stay. First, the location of the hotel is not good. There's a lot of construction going on around it so it's loud. Also, it's a bit away from the busy section of downtown and it's a bit quiet and creepy at night. Second, there's very little parking so if you want to park...get there early and don't give up your spot. Third, there's only ONE person helping downstairs (a very nice person) but if there are people there you have to wait forever for service. Fourth, the rooms are small. I mean SMALL (at least the non-suite rooms). Fifth, the building is old. The walls are beat up, paint is flaking, etc. Sixth, the floors are dirty. Our socks were brown on the bottoms after walking on the carpet just a little bit (we only stayed one night and weren't there much). Seventh, and most important of all, is that the rooms STINK TO HIGH HEAVEN! I couldn't believe how bad the smell was. I immediately went to the front desk and asked to be removed from my room because of the scent. It was like someone had dumped five gallons of cleaning chemical into the carpet or onto the bed or something. Honestly, the smell was overwhelming. I was ready to check out right then if they didn't move me to another room. They did upgrade me to a suite, which was a good size, but the same issues existed there. The smell was still horrendous (and it didn't fade even though I left the windows open the entire Saturday afternoon while we were out enjoying Seattle). The paint was chipping, the carpets were horribly dirty, and everything was just a bit bottom-tier. I am used to decent (not fancy) hotel rooms and this one did not meet standard in any way. Breakfast was good, the one person up front was nice, the room size (for a suite) was good, but everything else - horrible. Please read this and understand - I normally like the La Quinta.

It was good to have the extra room as we had a dog and baby with us. It was quiet- we didn't hear any noise from inside or outside the hotel. Cleanliness: needs some improvement here. There were some hairs on the bathroom floor, and they weren't mine. Air conditioning: worked okay, there were 2 speeds. The windows don't open. We didn't have a balcony but that might be something to ask for. Breakfast: pastries, muffins, yogurt, make your own waffles- it was great to have a good breakfast each morning to start the day. Parking: 10 spots above ground, the rest is underground and around the back through an alley. It was tight but we have a truck with a canopy and we managed to get a space everytime. We saw SUV's parked underground, and even a Hummer (taking up 2 spots, grrr). You do need some good parking skills though. Location: Great! We walked everywhere. The area is not the nicest, with parking lots and some construction around, but we were never afraid. If you want to pay more you can stay more in the heart of downtown.

Internet: One computer in lobby. We used it to print out some directions and didn't have to wait long to use it. Dog friendly: Dogs were welcome, no extra charge.

Let me start with the good points first. Its location, while on the fringes of downtown, is not really that bad if you don\u2019t mind walking. Seattle being a walker-friendly city has a simple lay-out that would not confuse any first-time visitor unless the triangular intersections in some areas get the better of you. If you love to visit the Space Needle though, you\u2019ll be in luck as anyone can leisurely walk to the same in less than 10 minutes. The hotel, formerly known as Hawthorn Suites, has been renovated to reflect the chain\u2019s features. Although the finishing touches still leave much to be desired, there is a distinct homeliness (and dog-friendliness) that will make you feel at ease, especially that the hustle and bustle of activities in the main tourist sections can no longer be heard. The lobby and breakfast areas are clean, just as the small room providing free internet access. There is also an enclosed part which is supposed to be a pseudo-spa with heated Jacuzzi exclusively for guests. The two elevators, however, are so old that only one was functioning during our stay. The room we got was clean with a good toilet/bath. There is a small fridge and microwave very useful when you don\u2019t want to eat out and just buy food from a convenience store two blocks away. Also, the cable TV has about 65 channels available. On the debit side, the balcony was obviously broken into in the past so a long wooden stick was placed on one side of the sliding door to reinforce security. It was reason enough for us not to leave our valuables inside the room when sightseeing or shopping. But one thing which terribly annoyed us was an unusual incident which happened during our second day. Since I am used to giving tips to housekeeping before checking out on the last morning, we left the room expecting the same to be cleaned by the time we return. Sure, it was tidied up, but on the notepad on the bedside table, the phrase \u201c[--] [--]\u201d was scribbled using either a fingernail or pointed object so you cannot easily read without putting the notepad close to your face. This alarmed us but thought it best to complain about the scribble the following morning to the manager. We were not sure yet if it was really housekeeping who did the same. Night came and passed and when I was taking a shower, the bathtub felt like it was rocking like a boat. It made me so dizzy that I stepped out of the room for fresh air after dressing up. At that point, my mother (who was reading the morning paper in her bed) told me that she felt something cold blew at the back of her neck while I was in the shower. She also added that \u201csomeone\u201d (or a spirit) quickly walked by the balcony door going to the room entrance. This happened (including the rocking boat shower) for two days and it was a good thing we were already about to leave thereafter. Now, I don\u2019t want to make this review sound like a ghost story or something, but it surely made our skin crawl. In fairness to the hotel, the people at front desk were very easy to deal with. They always went out of their way for any small request or question we had. The complimentary breakfast items are constantly replenished and it always starts our day full and bright. Never mind the morning \u2018presence\u2019 in the room.

All in all, the hotel was very nice, especially for the price, we would stay there again.", "Date": "July 12, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "La Quinta Inn & Suites Seattle Downtown", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g60878-d217807-Reviews-La_Quinta_Inn_Suites_Seattle_Downtown-Seattle_Washington.html", "Price": "$136 - $289*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">2224 8th Ave.</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Seattle</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">WA</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">98121</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "2515126", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/16/b2/16b2dcc164aeed0d8e037e4b763286f29large.jpg"}}
