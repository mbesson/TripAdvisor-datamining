The room looked recently renovated and was nicely decorated, clean, and quiet.

The deadbolt wasn't fixed until our last day there, and the light bulb still hadn't been replaced when we left. There was a one-time $4.99 charge for internet.

A little bit afraid before arriving at this hotel because of the previous postings for this hotel but when I arrived I found that things are a lot better than I imagined. The grounds are well kept and maintained. The lobby is a bit small but served it's purpose of checking in and welcoming guests. There is only one elevator but didn't have to wait too long every time I have to use it. I found that my room is clean enough for me to sleep. I didn't find any hairs in my bed or pillows. Did not find any traces of any stains on the sheets as some postings would suggest. The rooms have a small kitchen as this hotel chain primarily serve the long term stay clients. There is a full-size refrigerator, microwave, toaster, electric burner and basic utensils. Although I find it strange that they don't have any pots and pans to use for the electric burner nor having some sort of complimentary dish washing liquid to wash the plates and utensils that I did use. I had to resort to using a bath soap to wash them. I also think that they should have at least double the number of towels in the bathroom and have extra bed linens and pillow cases as there is no housekeeping provided if you are staying less than 7 nights, even then it is only once a week. Daily housekeeping is only provided if you pay a fee. The interior of the room definitely needs to be updated as it seems to be stuck in the early 90's. I have stayed at a different Extended StayAmerica property and it had the newer style furnishings seen on the hotel reservations website. I also find that since the carpeting all over the hotel is of the stain resistant type and is of dark color they most likely use it as an excuse to not periodically steam clean them to get the stains out. A properly cleaned carpet goes a long way to making the rooms smell much better than when I walked into it and it smelled like the typical LYSOL disinfectant odor. Despite the complaints I have with this hotel I still think that this is a much better place to stay than say Motel 6 or some other budget priced accommodations as those type of establishments , in my opinion attract the undesirable members of our society.

About 10 mins to a huge shopping center (IKEA, Restaurants, QualComm Stadium, etc). A few blocks from Highway 15 exit. Located on the edge of a small office park, not on a busy road. Overal Property: Elevator smelled, stairwells not great, full trash rooms, semi-dirty carpets, two of my four rooms had toilets constantly running. While it felt safe, this property is at least somewhat geared towards folks staying by the week (or longer). Rooms: Spotless, that's great. Some room noise from slamming metal doors (depends on your neighbors). I switched rooms after the first night because I had two rooms of construction guys constantly coming and going right next door. The next TWO rooms I was given had problems with the toilets (couldn't flush and constantly running). My fourth room was upgraded to a king and was in very good condition. No shampoo, no maid service (one time per week), small kitchenette. Also, some of my four rooms had a recliner, a coffee maker and a clock radio, some did not. Don't depend on any of it. Staff: They were fine, but as you might suspect, there is limited staffing. Overall: For $22 I can't complain too much. It WAS clean and convenient for my needs.

It was all very secure. However, when I got into my room, I wondered if they'd made a mistake and given me a room that hadn't been cleaned. Hair on the toilet, 4 long black hairs on the shower wall, hair dust balls in the corners of the bathroom, and many splashes of dirty drop marks strewn across the bathroom mirror. No, no mistake I soon realized, for the toilet paper had been folded in that unmistakable little \"v\" that tells the room has seen the maid. I found it rather disturbing. But my final word is this: I'll stay again, no matter the dirt. The walls were very solid, and although a family came careening down the hall speaking very loudly as I entered my room (and they entered next door to me), I couldn't hear them through the walls. As another reviewer mentioned, the hotel is in a boring part of San Diego, which is why I chose this area. I wanted sleep, and I got it every night. The area is safe as well. I recently moved from San Diego after having lived there all my life; I knew where to go where few tourists would venture, but where it was safe and pleasant to walk with lots of stores close by. I found the kitchen facilities to be adequate, but nothing spectacular, and yes, I did find the room depressing. There was little style or decor, but hey, I was interested in sleeping, so it was easy to overlook the flaws. One thing that could cause issues for some - I was in a non-smoking room, but the other end of the hall was smoking. I was the second room from the end furthest away from the smoking rooms, yet, opening my door felt like I was entering a Vegas casino at 2am, smoke seemingly billowing in on me. I'd open my door real quick and close it right away, then rush down the few steps to the stairs holding my breath. There was no ventilation at all in the halls. However, the individual doors to the rooms were sealed very well, for I never even got a hint of smoke when inside the room. So it wasn't bad for me, but if you're sensitive to smoke, this might be a deal breaker. Overall, I found the hotel to my liking, despite the flaws.
