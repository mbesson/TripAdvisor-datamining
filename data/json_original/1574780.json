We booked our stay through Agoda at a very good 110ish USD for two people a night. Singapore is a very expensive place for accommodation (unless you chose hotels / backpacker places) so finding this place at this price, in the location it was is a STEAL! The hotel is pretty much right in the middle of the two parallel MRT stations. To the west of the hotel is Farer Park MRT station (NE8) on the purple line. Whilst to the east of the hotel is Lavender MRT Station (EW11) on the green line. About 8 minutes to the city centre. Trains come every 5 minutes, always on time. It\u2019s about equal distance to both (depending on where you want to go). It takes about 10 minutes walk, but we found this no problem. The reception staff was friendly and everything is modern, clean and welcoming (hence why it's a steal). As per many other comments in regards to room size, we were a bit taken back about the size of the room, but we soon put this into context, as Singapore is quite compact. The room is good sized when put into perspective. Flat screen TV, clean and had comfy beds. We managed to oversleep because we found it so comfortable haha. Our only issue was the bathroom 'frosted' glass room divider. The frosted glass effect makes things a bit awkward if staying with others. Also there was quite a gap between the glass entrance door . So when we stayed, we would have one of us step out of the room, so it didn't become a peep show. If this was resolved it would be perfect. Apart from that, the breakfast was the usual fare with eggs and other foods, which are rotated on a daily basis. The hotel is located on one of the main roads, so taxis can be obtained if needed easily. The area that the hotel is in is very safe and not shady or suspect. Safe to walk at night. There\u2019s a few nice eateries nearby, 7/11\u2019s and also a few internet cafes etc. Overall we were very pleased with this hotel.

They are strict about check-in/out times. Breakfast is simple, average quality, but adequate. There are two food courts within 2 minutes walk, and taxi's are easy to get from the main road outside.

Yes, you can call a taxi, but let's be honest, if you are choosing a hotel in this price range you probably prefer to save that money. The are where teh hotel is also a quite dull one in next to a very busy road. Only positive is that with a 20 minutes walk you are in the colurful Little India, and that next to the hotel there is a local food court. The rooms are very small, and the bathroom is so small that you will struggle to close the door without having to enter the shower. The bathroom is actually a glass cubicle. This is not the first time I see one of them, but while these features normally give an edgy/modern feeling to the property, this one was just dull and cramped. The shower has actually a curtain, not a glass door, wich funtion is to separate it from the actual toilet pot. It could have been cleaner, especially - again - the bathroom.

The floors (other than the lobby) either smell like cigarette smoke or intense mildew (I do not know the last time they cleaned their carpets). Unfortunately, that extends to the rooms as well - we had to move rooms because our first smelled so badly mildewey it was unbearable, and the bathroom was even worse than our second room. Also - the bathroom doors are lightly frosted glass, so you watch your roommate do EVERYTHING. This has to be the worst design choice ever. We have stayed in other hotels with the same concept, but at least in them the frosting was stronger and the toilet wasn't a foot away from the bed, separated only by that glass.

Spend the extra few bucks and stay at the V Jellicoe - its directly above the metro stop and looks much, much nicer.

The hotel seems renovated, the room decor is nice, modern and practical. There was a kettle with tea and coffee, the fridge (which was not extremely powerful but did work while in the room), the plasma tv with international channels. The bathroom was tiny and the shower didn't allow for much movement, but served its purpose. As others pointed out, the bathroom has a glazed-over glass wall into the room. It looks nice and gives a more spacious feeling to the room but it's maybe not so comfortable if you're not travelling with your partner. The room was clean but the bathroom was not at its squeekiest - a few hairs here and there and some left-over toothpaste in the sink.

The front desk was not overly friendly but did provide me with all the things (iron, wake-up call - 5 minutes early, though, which makes a difference at 6:15am) and information (way to get to another part of town, nearest 7-11) that I needed. I left before breakfast (7am-10am), so I can't judge. Specifics: I finally stayed in a queen room on 6th floor (623). The room was on the top floor at the beginning of the hallway, overlooking the reception and a side street. Very bright in the afternoon light with a window seat that was good for studying. All perfect until the evening when it became apparent that there's no sound-proofing whatsoever. I could hear a machine (aircon?) buzzing outside, cars whooshing down the street (remember, I was facing the side street so I can't imagine what the other side must feel like) and every footstep and word spoken on the corridor. I was on Skype with a friend when he asked what the noise was. It was a baby crying down the corridor! True, it's not the hotel's fault if people were talking loudly in the corridor at midnight or even 3am but that's why insulation is for. I'm not a light sleeper but I woke up several times during the night because of the noise from the hallway. Needless to say, not a good night's sleep at all. Note: I originally booked a single room which had a window overlooking a wall and was the size of a closet (while the bathroom door was open, we could not get out the front door). The one I saw was 301 but I was told all single rooms are the same. As the single room had no natural light to speak of and apart from the bed no place for me to study, they offered a queen room for me (for additional charge of course). Tip: I'm not sure I'd stay again in this hotel. The need to get a rest and sleep through the night is after all not specific just to me and my needs during this trip. I got more sleep staying at one of the hotels on the famously nosy Khao San road in Bangkok, to give you an idea. But if no other option, I'd ask for a back room (facing the wall or the street parallel to the main street) at the end of the hallway away from the elevators and other guests.

Last visited Singapore in 2003 so I was fully aware of the rise in prices of nearly everything in Singapore. So booking something of good value plus the good reviews via Trip Advisor certainly helped our decision to book the Aqueen Hotel Lavender. Although the Hotel is some distance away from the tourist attractions of Singapore (e.g. Orchard Road, Chinatown and Harbour Front), it is only a 10 minute walk from Lavender MRT which can get you almost anywhere in the City within a couple of minutes. The Hotel was modern and the Rooms were of good size with comfy beds. I note quite a number of reports add the negative of having glass doors and windows surrounding the bathroom. For me personally it didn\u2019t bother me, but my friend and his partner did find this a bit annoying. I couldn\u2019t really fault this Hotel, which included the friendly greetings at reception to the good standard complimentary breakfast buffet that was available each morning. The Hotel also had FREE WiFi, which is always a \u2018big\u2019 plus for me when using hotels. Some worthwhile tips if staying at this Hotel is to use the \u2018Hawker\u2019 type Food Courts which are located nearby to the Hotel. There you can get an array of authentic / local Singapore food for very few $$$. Plus it\u2019s also a good place to just people watch at night as Singapore comes to life.

The room was fairly new, small but compact. For one night of sleep I couldn't have asked for more, or so I thought. The bathroom was small with a little area for shower, an average-sized man would find it difficult to move around in that space. The rest of the room was nicely equipped, a flat-panel television, some tea-making facilities, complimentary water .... and free WiFi inside the room! What a surprise, what a delight! The bed was small but comfy enough so no complaints here until I started to fall asleep. As the room was facing the road - a dual-carriageway, the noise from the road was not only audible but actually quite loud. Even though I usually sleep quite well in hotels, this wasn't one of the nights I want to remember. As morning traffic increased (from 4am onwards), I would wake up with the noise of each passing car. When the trucks or containers passed through, the noise was totally unbearable. When the morning came, I took a look at the windows only to discover that not only were they not double-glazed, the glass was very thin and they were of the sliding type with gaps all round. The complimentary breakfast was served in a little cafe opposite the reception. A buffet type of arrangement with limited choices and the most uninviting smell or taste.

Soo cheap for a place like Singapore and food is excellent (dinner for 2 incl. drinks = SGD 15). 2. Do not hesitate to hail taxis, they are so cheap compared to European fees, they will drive you everywhere quite quickly! (Lavender to Marina Bay = 4SGD) 3.

I had made the booking directly with the hotel over the phone from another country and the credit card details were required for the confirmation of the reservation. The rate was better for booking through the phone than on the internet. Getting to the hotel was perhaps a little difficult as the taxi driver didn\u2019t know exactly where the hotel was located and also, there wasn\u2019t a proper place for the taxi to stop and allow for the luggage to be unloaded. Instead, the side street was used. The reception was only just acceptable in its approach towards check-in and check-out, it couldn\u2019t be described as being friendly but obviously, a lot of the budget hotels in Singapore are not really just used for accommodation purposes and perhaps that might have to be taken into account in this case because the hotel is located in an area that does appear to be a little seedy. The room was very clean but on the small side. The bed was quite low-lying and a little hard but still offered a reasonable sleep. The soundproofing of the room from the corridor was not a strong point but otherwise, the room seemed to be quiet. My room didn't have the road noise issues mentioned in earlier reviews. The TV was very nice for a budget hotel and the channel selection was ok. The room also came with a safe. The shower was adequate and comfortable but the window pane looking out to the room and the entrance to the bathroom itself was only half-frosted, which could cause potential privacy issues. I liked the wedged mirror design within the bathroom, it offered a multi-angled view. The hotel is located near to a few eateries and also quite a large foodcourt, which seemed to be open even quite late at night because it was about midnight when I arrived at the hotel and the foodcourt was still open. However, the area is probably a little bit red-light in character with some karaoke places. It\u2019s not quite Geylang but seemed a little similar. The nearest MRT station is quite a distance away and that could be a problem if this hotel is meant as an exploration base but taxis shouldn't be much of a problem. The breakfast was included in the rate but it didn\u2019t really offer a huge selection and the food quality was just acceptable. The only things on offer were bread, pastries, chicken ham, omelette, saut\u00e9ed potato, mee goreng, porridge, fruit juices and coffee and tea. The room rate here seemed a little on the high side, it wasn\u2019t truly in the budget range but I found the hotel quality to be quite good, especially with the room cleanliness and features. However, paying maybe 30-40% more could secure a much larger room in Singapore. I am not totally convinced that the hotel offers value but it was still a highly acceptable stay.

The rooms are modern (LCD television, modern furnishings), comfortable, cozy and very affordable for Singapore. There is free wireless internet, free breakfast and the hotel is about a 12 minute walk to the Lavender MRT station which connects to all the major sights and the airport. The hotel is also close to Little India which is a great place to walk around and a food market is a couple blocks away. The hotel does have a few quirks, which may or may not be deal breakers for travelers. The walls in the hotel are a bit thin, so if there are people talking in the hallway, it can be a bit disruptive. Also, the bathroom is separated by a glass door and glass wall, part of which is frosted. This might be an issue if bathroom privacy is an issue for you. Finally, the hotel is next to a casket company so there were a couple of small funeral processions that happened during the day here during our stay.

Singapore is notoriously expensive compared to its Asian neighbors, so it was really worth it to go through all the hotels to find the one with a good location without being too expensive. I transferred to Aqueen after staying at Parkroyal. One important tip: don't expect the cab drivers to know the location of the hotel right away. Always have a map in hand, sometimes they are more familiar with the hotels around Aqueen. Check in was quick. I was asked to pay right away, which was no problem. The place was remarkably clean, and its staff was friendly enough. Another tip: for those expecting to have bellboys to assist you with your luggage - this is definitely not your place. You're pretty much on your own, which I actually liked. My room was in one end of the hallway, without much of a view since it was facing another room on another side of the building. I had to draw the curtains often because I could clearly see what the other person is doing in the room opposite of mine, as well as the rooms below him. Halls were also small, two people with luggages would never be able to walk that hall at the same time. My room was a real surprise. I was not expecting much because of the hotel's price range, but they surely do offer standard amenities that top hotels also have. I greatly appreciated the button controls by the door and the nightstand. I also found the room's design a bit smart - they made most out of the space for every room. Since I was alone, there was more than enough room for my things (you can place them by the window). Internet connection was also reliable, and the best part is that it's for free. One issue was the bathroom. I'm very short, and I found the bathroom too tiny. I could not imagine how it would have been like for much bigger backpackers. It would also be difficult if you're sharing the room with someone since there is only a small frosted wall between the shower area and the bedroom. Get another room if you're not comfy with this set up. Another issue is noise. I could clearly hear what people were talking about in the hallway, and sometimes, the room next to mine. I have to say I didn't get quality sleep during my stay. Breakfast - it was surprisingly homey. You just have to get up early to get most out of the breakfast. A major plus was the friendly guests who would gladly share a table with you - although this may not really happen to everyone. Location - just a few minutes' walking distance away from train stations, Little India, and malls. Just keep one thing in mind - don't expect much. You'll appreciate Aqueen Lavender if you don't expect so much of the hotel, trust me.

My first request was granted immediately, but due to lack of available rooms, I could only be given a room on the second floor which was on a seldom used side street, which was acceptable. The hotel is very modern and clean. All the standard amenities were available in the room, but the biggest attraction for me was the free breakfast, free in-room wifi & free local calls, including calls to handphones within the city. The room is modern and functional, approximately 20 square meters, which is quite acceptable by Singapore standards. Two drawbacks in the room are the bed which was probably the hardest bed I slept on in a long time. The second being the shower design which left the bathroom floor all wet after taking a shower. Close by ( a block away) s a food court offering a wide array of local fare which is quite delicious and prices are very reasonable. The chicken rice at one of the stalls was a steal at 5 singapore dollars. 7-11 and other convenience stores are available nearby. Unfortunately, I did not get to try the buffet breakfast which came with my reservation, as I had to cut short my stay due to a family emergency. If you're travelling on a budget (I paid approx. US$120/night), I would definitely recommend staying at this hotel.

We found this hotel from the online booking, and couldn't get any better rates than this hotel. We both are a trip-advisor minded couple, so we always look at the hotel rating & percentage of recommendation. First we decided to stay closer to Orchard since we would only stay for 3 nights. But then other than Ibis Bencoolen, all other hotels in Orchard vicinity is either super expensive or crappy. During our vacation date, the rate in Ibis is quite expensive, especially if we consider to not spend the whole day in bed. Then we found this Aqueen Hotel Lavender, which rated relatively competitive with Ibis. The price was okay, the best we could get. Honestly reading at the review, we expect a really small room with nothing special about it. But we trully were surprised with everything in it. The design of the hotel is really nice, minimalist with lots of glass elements, and sensory switch lamp, with the new Sharp Aquos TV, and big clean bed. The bathroom was quite small, but with our Asian posture, we fit just fine and have no trouble navigating. Even though there was a see-through section on the shower where you can be seen by people in the bedroom (not suggested for non-family or non-spouse). We had the queen size bedroom, and happy with our room. Breakfast was pretty basic, scrambled egg, sausage, hash brown, cereal, bread, and porridge (there were quite a lot of Asians staying as well when we got there). The hotel itself is located at Lavender St. You can take the MRT from Changi Airport & alight directly at MRT Lavender (the green line MRT) in 20 minutes. Young or fit traveller can easily walk from the MRT station to the hotel for about 15-20 minutes (normal walking phase). You can tag along you luggage as the pedestrian area is large. Alternatively you can take the bus or taxi (which can be quite expensive). We can travel easily to Bugis, Harbour Front, and even Clarke Quay as the MRT line connects to those areas as well.

No egg-station with eggs made-to-order, though they did serve boiled and / or scrambled eggs as part of the buffet. Lavender MRT is a good 10 to 15 minute walk away - might be inconvenient for those who are unable to or do not want to walk the distance. The hotel is situated in a quiet neighbourhood, close to little India. We didn't have any view from our 3rd floor room, which overlooked the roof of the lobby below, and I imagine the other rooms wouldn't have much of a view either. The laundry spoiled my husband's tee-shirt (got it stained), they didn't charge us the laundry costs for the tee when we complained, but no offers to compensate the cost of tee-shirt itself. Overall, not a bad hotel, but not great either. If you're going to be spending a lot of time in the hotel room, I suggest you get a more interesting hotel in a better location.

At best you can determine if its raining out. 5) The hallways are loud and even people talking normally can be heard in the rooms. 6) Our electronic key stopped functioning twice during our visit requiring reprogramming at the front desk. 7) On arrival we were given our electronic key and room only to find on entry to that room that it was the room and a duplicate of the secure key to the couple who had just checked in before us. This was quite embarrassing to all involved.

The rooms are small, but not tiny, unlike in other budget hotels in Hong Kong, SG or Malaysia I have been staying before it was easily possible to walk around the bed (I had a Queensize-bed which was a little on the small side, though), the room had all amenities that you may need and probably not expect in a budget-joint: a Cupboard, not just a hook on the wall as in other cheapo-places, water heater and complimentary coffee/tea-making-facilities, free slippers, a safe, free WiFi ( a good, stable connection as is common in SG), two bottles of water per day. the bathroom is small too, but it has all the usual amenities. as some other members here, I really HATE those glass-walls many new hotels have nowadays, but there is a curtain and the glass has an adhesive foil attached, it appears to be frosted glass, so it did not bother me at all. the aircon is strong and makes the room VERY cold, too cold for my taste and I somehow were not able to adjust it. the location is not as bad as it first seems, the Lavender MRT-station is less far away than I thought (though with a lot of luggage and considering the sometimes oppressive humidity of SG you may rather opt for a cab or the Minivan-Shuttle for SG$ 9 from the airport on your arrival). plenty of excellent Cheapo-food places around, the fantastic Lavender-foodcourt is just a stonethrow away, as are several minimarkets plus - for those who r into a different kind of entertainment - several dodgy karaoke joints (but far enough so no need to worry about that). Lavender Bus station is just opposite, so even your onward-journey is a breeze, considering you leave by Bus for Malaysia or maybe even Thailand. Very convenient ! Well ok, it was not THAT 100% perfect: the hotel is located on a very busy road, and even I got a room NOT facing the street as I requested, there was still quite some noise to be heard until very late. I don't wanna know how noisy those rooms facing the main road are. the coffeeshop on the ground-floor does not seem to offer a wide menu and the prices are not very competitive. considering the proximity of the several foodcourts and eateries, it was no wonder I never saw any patrons in there during my 2 days stay. on the day I checked out I asked them if I can have a late check-out, as my flight departed in the early evening, but they were not willing to give me even just 1 hour ! they said \"sorry we are fully booked today\", but that's lame ! The house-keeping staff can not make up all the rooms at the same time and not 100% of the new guests do not check in exactly at 2 pm ! But nevertheless, I would recommend this place to others who don't wanna spend too much in SG on accom. the prices seem to rise quickly, though. I know when the hotel opened just months ago or so, the rate was below 100 SG$ (maybe an introduction-rate). I paid 108, and I checked the rates just yesterday again, as I have to go to SG again very soon, and now it is already 118 SG$. Not sooooo competitive anymore. but still worth the few Bucks more, compared to other budget options in SG like those Hotel81's, Fragrance's or Value-Hotels. those are often more or less brothels, where the Aqueen definitely is not (thanks god!).

If you check out sites like wotif.com or hotelclub.com, and book in advance, you can stay at a 3.5 or 4 star in the financial district for only 10 - 15 more per night - if you can afford the little bit extra DO IT! I don't really consider this to be a hotel - they have no guest services, they were very unhelpful and rude when I requested little things (adapter and bottle opener) - they rudely told me they don't provide extras, although they have a tiny bar so I should have been able to at least get use of a bottle opener. The floor is concrete, and feels like it. The bed is also concrete. I can't overstate how hard and uncomfortable it was - like sleeping on the floor. I asked for the quietest possible room and was assured I had been given it, but the traffic noise was incredibly loud and still kept me awake through my earplugs.

However when we arrived at the hotel the staff were very friendly and checked us in. We had a standard double room on the 6th floor, on entering the room it was very clean but basic it reminded me of an Ibis hotel it was the same kind of design, there was a fridge in the room but nothing inside. We were provided with complimentary bottled water and toiletries. The rooms do not have double glazing so it could be quite noisy at times, also during our second night there was a lot of shouting in the corridor which was disturbing. The bed was also very small & not very comfy. I think the hotel rooms are more suited to couples or single people due to them being quite small and also the bathroom is a little see through as it is a glass window and door with a frosted glass line around the middle, so you can sort of see in the bathroom. The location of the hotel isn't too bad considering the price, we were getting taxis into the centre of Singapore because taxis in Singapore are very cheap, it was 8 Singapore dollars from the hotel to Orchard Road, and 18 SD to the airport. The MRT station is about a 10 minute walk from the hotel. Overall the price of this hotel is very good for Singapore and I would probably stay here again just because of that.", "Date": "May 6, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bromsgrove, England", "Title": "\u201cImpressed\u201d", "Author": "carrowsmith", "ReviewID": "UR63155079", "Content": "Very modern, clean and friendly place.

I stayed there for 2 nights and found out that the reviews I read online were accurate. The hotel is relatively new, providing guests with sleek and modern-design rooms. The room is not too big but somehow quite cozy, with LCD TV. Coffee-making facilities are provided. The wifi is working great. The staff is very helpful. Downstairs in the lobby, there is a small cafe serving delicious Boston mussels. The hotel doesn't provide breakfast, but don't worry, there are numerous food courts around the hotel. if you're up for Chinese food, there is a food court just one block from the hotel. But if you prefer moslem food or thai food, just walk a bit further toward Mustafa center, before reaching Mustafa, there would be a food court on your right serving great and cheap Tom Yam Goong (Spicy Thai seafood soup). If there is a little drawback, it's the location. It takes about 10 minutes walking from the nearest MRT station (Lavender), and it could be quite annoying when you've got to do it in the middle of a sunny day :). However, if you want to take the cab, the hotel janitor would gladly help you to find one (it takes less than SGD 10 to go to Orchard). Or, if you prefer the bus, the bus stop is just about 50 m away. It takes about 20 minute bus-ride to the Esplanade. My advice is, stay here if you want to spend your days sightseeing around Singapore, and return to the hotel in the evening, so the hotel is mainly your place to take a rest. Due to its location, it's not practical to stay in this hotel if you need to go back and forth, unless your business is nearby.", "Date": "April 14, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "singapore", "Title": "\u201cLove it!\u201d", "Author": "veenquin", "ReviewID": "UR61103350", "Content": "This place exceeded my expectation.

Had short conversations with their managers, both are kind and helpful. I would recommend young couple to try this hotel. Good location where you can easily grab some foods and transportation are very convenient too, all within 10-15mins. The only thing that upset me was when I was in the room; my boyfriend had gone to 7-11 to get some milk. When he came back, he went to the lounge to have a quick glance but what surprised him was, a man came to him and had a conversation with him and started to offer if my boyfriend wants a room, can get his help. The worst part is he even hinted my boyfriend that he can have some \"fun\" and drinks and will be accompanied by young girls in the lounge too. For the period of night time, the lounge was very noisy as the window was not really sound proof and what irritates us a lot was the bad singing from the girl. During morning, we were waked up by the housekeeping who talks so loud outside our room. Suggest that they look into this matter as night we can\u2019t sleep well, and morning we was woke up by the loud voices outside our room.

Relative to other parts of southeast Asia, it is more expensive to live in/visit Singapore and accomodations are more expensive so at 75 SGD per night, this hotel is budget for Singapore and pretty good value. Despite being small, the rooms are modern, impecabbly clean, and have everything you need - including coffee/tea making facilities, a mini fridge, a desk, free decent wi-fi, and a big flat screen tv with a few good English channels to choose from. As mentioned, the bathroom is made of frosted glass so privacy is a bit limited in that respect and there is only half a glass wall seperating the shower from the rest of the small bathroom so the whole bathroom does tend to get a bit wet when you shower. My husband and I accidentally booked a twin room instead of a double, but the cleaning lady immediately helped us put the two beds together and they fit together nicely to form a double bed. Unlike a previous reviewer, our reservation clearly stated that taxes/service charge was on top of the room rate so there were no surprises there. If you're a bit of a night owl, the hotel has the perfect location - there's a number of bars nearby, but they're far enough that you can't hear noise from them when you're in your room. There's also plenty of 24 hour convenience stores and late night food choices nearby, as well as the 24 hour Mustafa center about 10 min walk away where you can get anything from appliances to jewlery to groceries anytime of the day! The lavender food court on the next street over offers a huge array of good food choices at fair prices and many stalls stay open late. As mentioned, no breakfast is included but plenty of places to eat cheap nearby. It's about a 10 min walk to the metro/subway. If you're feeling lazy or carrying heavy luggage when arriving you can grab a cab from the metro station to the hotel for just $3 SGD. Singapore has a very modern and efficient subway system so we found the location of the hotel great for exploring. The only problem with the subway is you have to wait in line to refund your stupid subway card to get $1 refund each time! My only complaint about the hotel is that at checkout, we had to already paid but had to wait while they sent someone up to our room to do God knows what since there was no mini bar to check over.
