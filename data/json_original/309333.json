{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Spooky Hotel Puri Wisata Bungalows is located near Seminyak, Bali. It is hard to find due to its little size that consists of 27 tiny rooms. People know more about the pub in front of the hotel called Jaya pub.Cleanliness: 2/10When I first enter the toilet, I found a roach inside. The bedsheet also looks as if it was never cleaned before.Coziness: 2/10The hotel itself is very spooky at night. You can also hear frightening sounds at night.Facility: 4/10At least the hotel has a fridge, TV and Air Conditioner. The hotel don't have towels.Food: 4/10The food in the hotel is not very bad.
