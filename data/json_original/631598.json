I'm a road warrior so hence, I've got my head down (not looking around for anything exciting like ambiance), tugging a piece of luggage with both hands into the front of the hotel. The double front doors automatically open, as they should, when I'm not even paying any attention to them. I enter a brief anti-lobby then another set of doors; or should I say, a single pull door not even wide enough to pull the luggage through. So I've got to drop the luggage, swing the door, and push one piece through at a time into the hotel lobby. I've not seen this poor a piece of engineering since the Yugo.

They are just about a mile from the zoo. All though the location is a little odd the price was great. The hotel rooms themselves were amazing. We travel with a two year old that goes to bed early so we prefer suites whenever possible. I booked a one bedroom but was upgraded to a two bedroom which was perfect. This was a former apartment building so they are set up with a long hallway with the bedrooms and bathroom off of that. The kitchen was perfect and enabled us to save money by cooking both nights of our stay. My husband appreciated the recliner in the living room. My son loved having his own room in a hotel. The area is mostly hospitals and the IUPUI campus so a lot of students and people staying while their family is in the hospital. We also saw a lot of football fans staying there due to the close proximity to the Colts stadium. It seemed very safe and there was a fence that surrounded the entire property. We did not go down and check out the pool area since it is outdoors and it was way to cold for that. There also was a playground area down there but the weather was not right for that either. The room was very clean as were the hallways and lobby. The little grocery area was well stocked but a little expensive but nice if you needed something quick. They offered free DVD\u2019s to go with the DVD player in the room. Not a big choice but a nice touch. The staff was all very helpful and friendly. The free wifi worked great except for the morning that they had changed the password and I didn\u2019t know it. A quick trip to the desk and I was back online. The kitchen provided paper towels, free coffee, and tea bags. Our stay was great and we hope to stay there again in the spring. I will note they were having a lot of issues with one of the elevators but they were working to fix it most of the time we were there.

Friend had one room and I had another. Rooms are clean, well-appointed, and comfortable. I liked the bed immensely and slept very well all 4 nights at this hotel. Candlewood, being an extended stay chain, had the mini kitchen (though full size fridge) that would work very well for longer stays were you might not want to eat out every meal (though, for our purposes of visit, we didn't need a kitchen). Both rooms had a living room area and bedroom area with TV's in both. TV's slightly outdated but not terrible. Staff was mostly very pleasant and helpful. About the \"worst\", if you will, was one guy who wasn't gushy friendly, but never failed to attend to any questions we had. Also, once you started talking with this gentleman he really started opening up so I took it as just a person that is friendly but perhaps not overly extroverted. I didn't use the pool (which is outdoors) or exercise room, but checked it out on the off-chance I would be motivated to exercise on vacation. Room appeared to be clean and well-kept. Internet connection worked very well, other than having to sign on each time you turned the computer on...nothing major... Perhaps the only item to keep in mind is this property is clearly oriented to IUPUI hospital visitors - which it appears they do very well. You will definitely see many hospital visitors here and they hotel's shuttle even specifically has a wheelchair lift. It is also worthwhile to keep in mind if you are not staying here in connection to hospital visit this property is on the definite outer edge of downtown area. It's not an atrocious drive, probably 5-10 minutes, but if you need to be in the \"thick of it all\" this would not be your choice. Indeed, the property is located in a somewhat industrial/residential area with little around for the tourist.

Actually it stated all rooms types were still available so couldn't quite figure out that one. Now I don't mind to have to go outside but I hate when you book a reservation and your room type is \"suddenly unavailable\" Now the lady who checked us in was quite nice and stated she would give us a 10% discount for our trouble so I was fine with that but then we go to check out and our room rate went from $111 a night to $159 with the 10% off???? It all was set right in the end but be sure to check your room bill before checking out. If they would have honored my reservation for a smoking room and also not messed with the bill I would give it 5 stars.

The rooms come with a full kitchen [micro only],Tv with VCR & DVD player plus a CD player (movies and music cd's are free from their library). Also available is a mini-C store, outdoor grill , fitness gym, indoor pool and a FREE laudramat. It's location is less than 15 min from city centre but nearby are 2 malls and at least 25 restaurants to choose from with-in a 3mi distance. Our personal favorite is Loon Lake Lodge which is a 1/4 mi drive for a 1,000 mi away dining experience.

We were greeted at the front entrance by Indy 500 hangers-on sitting on the curb with a case of Coronas, drinking it up in front of the property. It almost looked like we were pulling up to the front of a dorm building at Purdue. People were milling about and looked slightly out of place. This property has had a makeover and looked fresh and new inside. Our suite couldn't have been better. You will like your room. The location is not exactly in what I would call the \"City Centre\", but it is close. You will need a car or will have to call a cab to get to the city center. Although the place was clean, remodeled, and easy to get to, following the hotel website directions, it felt like we were in a whole different world coming and going. The front desk is almost set up like entering a dormatory. The girl at the front desk was friendly and checked us in just fine, but she seemed to be more interested in the Corona drinking young guy that was hitting on her than she was in explaining the details of the property to us. We stayed on the 10th floor and looking out the window at 3am there were people mlling about down in front front of the place. \"Creepy\" was the word my wife used to describe the outside atmosphere. Overall, if you can get over the oddity of the place outside, the construction still going on around the building itself and the oddballs hanging around the place, this is a great place to stay. No free breakfast, but if you are into cooking yourself, no problem here as you have all the goods to do that. You might even invite some of your new friends you meet outside at 3am to help cook breakfast and enjoy an omlet with you in your room.", "Date": "May 30, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "SE, WI", "Title": "\u201cGreat place to stay\u201d", "Author": "vbfamily", "ReviewID": "UR7276877", "Content": "This hotel has just been completely remodeled. There was still some drywall dust in the hallway where light fixtures were installed. The only way to tell it is not a new building is the elevator was not new. There still must be some remodeling going on because during the day, Saturday included, they were using a jackhammer in the basement. We were six floors up right above the work and it was annoying. The rooms were great. The only thing missing from the full kitchen was an oven, it had everything else, including a dishwasher. They have both one and two bedrooms suites. The two bedroom suites were the size of an apartment and everything is new. Each bedroom had a TV along with the \"living area\". The beds were very comfortable. I will stay at this hotel the next time I am in Indy.", "Date": "April 3, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Madison, WI", "Title": "\u201cwon't go back\u201d", "Author": "luuluu", "ReviewID": "UR4069541", "Content": "Stayed here for one night in Oct 05. I had never stayed at this chain before so I was curious about it. Extremely close to Interstate so highway noise definitely an issue. This place had the feel of a singles apartment complex and not in a good way. No breakfast. I will note that the staff was extremely friendly and helpful.
