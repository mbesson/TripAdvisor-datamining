The Rive Gauche Hotel is perfectly situated. The room was so small that we thought we had been wrongly allocated as we had booked a Superior room, however when I asked at reception I was told we had in fact been upgraded to a Deluxe room, we were left wondering what the difference was. Admittedly the hotel offers a high standard of decor and the bed was comfortable however there was just a tiny alcove to serve as a bedside shelf space, mirrored to give a larger appearance; only one chair and storage was adequate for only a short stay having space for only 4 hangars, no drawers and narrow shelving. In the tiny bathroom the walk-in shower was a good size although the taps offered no clues to temperature control and the hotwater temperature was almost scalding; there were no towel hooks meaning that damp towels had to be hung on the doors which then could not be closed without removing them although in fact the split doors did not meet in the middle when closed. We wondered whether this was the reason for the TV in the bathroom, to enable a degree of privacy. An irritation was the lack of a proper drinking glass, we got a very flimsy plastic disposable cup which was not replaced until we asked at the desk.

On going back to reception I was told not to worry about the room, it was nearly ready! The room was an ok size but I was disappointed that they didn't mention our honeymoon even though we had informed them. Then it got worse, the first morning we were woken before 8am to a workman directly outside the window banging and crashing, we went to reception and had an argument with them as they kept saying there was no scaffolding outside! Just as I was about to blow my top and tell them to go to the room and see for themselves they decided the scaffolding was there but it was ok because work had finished they were just taking the scaffolding down. I asked them how long it would take and to my annoyance they said it would be gone by the end of the week (we were only staying four nights). Finally they agreed we could move room but ended up with a smaller one with a rubbish view at the back of the hotel although the room was much quiter. We did recieve a small discount for the nights we were in the second room but you only have one honeymoon and ours was slightly spoilt by the experience. At the time of booking we were never informed of works taking place, otherwise we would have booked another hotel.

There's also a small TV embedded in the bathroom mirror over the sink, I nice touch: you can shave while watching the morning news... The breakfast was a bit of a disappointment, the only reason we give it four stars and not five: we did not expect an English breakfast, of course, but the bread was rather poor, not what you expect in Paris, where baguettes and pastries are typically delicious. There was only one choice of cheese and no cold cuts at all. Any 3-star hotel in the area will do better than that at breakfast. Everything else was great, though.

I had originally booked four nights (the 27th through the 31st of January) but, as Istanbul (the preceding destination on a long and very happy trip) was quite a bit colder than usual, even for this time of year, both my sister and I contacted the hotel to inquire whether it might be possibile to anticipate my earlier reservation for an extra six nights or so. NO PROBLEM, Marie-H\u00e9l\u00e8ne at the S\u00e9l\u00e8ct promptly replied. I could stay in the very same rooom (a CHAMBRE SUP\u00c9RIEURE AVEC VUE DE LA PLACE SORBONNE) for the same \"special price\" (194,25 Euros a night) except for one small detail. The first two nights would be slightly more expensive (275 Euros). What the heck, I thought... Might as well splurge... To my great consternation and amazement, as my texi pulled in to the Place de la Sorbonne I saw that the whole front of the hotel was surrounded by scaffolding. I expressed my dismay to the young man at the reception desk (alone in the hotel - there is no staff whatever to help with luggage, no doorman, nothing. Seriously.) and told him directly and politely that I was shocked the S\u00e9l\u00e8ct would not have informed a returning customer of this small but important detail - no view but scaffolding from the expensive double on a high floor - and that I was there and then giving him three alternatives, to wit: (a) I would accept another room either more or less expensive anywher in the hotel that did not have scaffolding outside its window (b) I would find another hotel first thing in the morning or (c) he could give me a reduction in the expensive charges for the first two nights and I would then have more time to look for accomodations elsewhere. To my complete astonsihment, I was told by Ruholla that ALL the rooms had scaffolding outside their windows as the hotel was about to embark on extensive renovation. As for the discounted two nights, he immediately contacted Marie-H\u00e9l\u00e8ne by telephone and obtained authorization for a 10% discount FOR THE FIRST NIGHT. The rest, he told me with a smile, would have to be taken up with her personally the next morning. Tired after my flight from Turkey and a colossal Sunday night traffic jam on the way into Paris from Cahrles de Gaulle, I trudged up to my room (only to discover that the door on the only elevator in the hotel - yes, the one I was to find out the very next morning would be shared by construction workers and guests for the duration of my stay and the renovation - was jamming). I was informed that this would be taken care of immediately, that the elevator maintenance people had just been contacted. On a Sunday evening. You Think? Arriving in my room, I called to order room service only to be told there was none, in spite of the rather extensive menu on the teensy weensy \"desk\" facing my bed. Aghast, I hung up and sat there, contemplating the prospect of having to go out on a Sunday night looking for drinking water (there are no mini-bars in the rooms either, by the way). At this point, the phone rang and Ruhola informed me that there actually WAS room service, albeit for drinks only. So I got my mineral water (which HE broought to my door minutes later). Breakfast was desultory and truly dreadful - the other guests looked miserable, probably as a result of the fact that plastic sheeting had begun to be laid on all the floors VERY early that morning and that the workmen who were working on the renovation were now sharing the minuscule lift with the faulty door with all the hotel guests, many of whom could be seem using the stairs in various states of desperation. This story has a happy ending, though. As soon as I had finished my coffee, I found another hotel I had also stayed at in other visits to Paris (a city I dearly love and have visited on so many occasions I have lost count of the total number). My request for a room was accepted on the spot. Reception was warm and friendly for almost half the price of the S\u00e9l\u00e8ct, with continental breakfast thrown in as a courtesy. Beware of the S\u00e9l\u00e8ct and its mercenary prices (for the precious little that they offer their guests) and thoroughly dishonest and disrespectful business practices. Forwarned is forearmed.

We were not disappointed. We were warmly recieved by a wonderful lady (receptionist) who immediately made us feel very welcome . She even took the time to do a walk around with us to point out the key areas of the modest hotel built on several floors, and then provided us with a prepacked folder containing maps and places to see in Paris (an interesting surprise). This lady also was very helpful in answering our questions, mostly for directions and how to weave our way to key Paris sites by subway. As most rooms in Europe which are usually small, these ones were reasonable in comparison AND they had airconditioning! There is also a small usefull elevator as the stairs are steep and winding. The washrooms were very clean and fairly modern. The beds were thankfully very comfortable. As most areas in Paris there is a lot of noise due to traffic until about 3am and mercifully you could kill the noise by closing the hotel windows. A pleasant surprise was free internet. There are also safety boxes in the room. A little disappointment was the breakfast (included in price) which had limited selection and was the same every morning so we found ourselves hungry shortly after, and headed for the restaurants! The hotel location is very interesting. Place de La Sorbonne, which is a small car free square just off the university campuses and only 2 blocks from an amazing car free zone (several old typically French blocks with romantic narrow winding streets) filled with bistros, restaurants and souvenir shops, cordonned off by churches and small museums. A very pleasant surprise. The hotel is also about 4 blocks of pleasant walk (St Michel Blvd) to the bridge which crosses over to the Notre Dame Cathedral area. Also the subway is one block away, a must after a few days of walking. Just a note of interest that the hotel is near the university campuses so there are a lot of students walking around which we actually found refreshing and interesting. I would recommend this hotel for romantic getaways, for families with children old enough to appreciate bistros and walks through narrow streets and for all who are interested to take a break from the rat race with no forwarding address!

I first stayed here a number of years ago when I was lecturing during the summer in Paris; it was close to the venue and I picked it really because of that. But it grew on me for a lot of reasons. It is in the perfect location, near to RER stations if you are going to either airport, it is quite near the Latin Quarter and central to go to any of the major tourist stops. It is also incredibly friendly and despite the fact that hotel space in Paris is quite..well economical (read small), the design makes incredibly good use of the space. So for the particulars, this hotel is located on Place de la Sorbonne, which is near the Pantheon and the Sorbonne as well as Paris II (two big Universities in Paris). The closest RER stop or metro is Luxembourg. When you get off there, walk up Blvd St Michel and you are there in about 5-8 minutes. When you enter the hotel the first thing that will strike you is a fairly sleek design. The lobby has been renovated and is quite nice. There is a small bar and a few seating areas, one of which has a communal tv. The lobby area has wi-fi and it is free. There is not really wi-fi in the rooms but mine (room 74) had it if you sat closer to the door. I booked a single and not sure if they gave me one as it could easily have accommodate 2 people. The bed was a bit bigger than a queen size and whilst there was not much room around the bed, again the hotel design made efficient use of space, so there was storage space on both sides of the bed, an in room safe, a flat screen tv and even a small desk. The bathroom had door that opened a bit like a cupboard so I suppose that might not be great if you are sharing and want a bit of privacy but there was a good shower and again, even the bathroom, although small was well kitted out. breakfast is included in all the rates and is nothing special--cereals, lots of bread choices, croissant, small sweet rolls as well as cheese, yoghurt and fruit. For me, it was perfect but for others looking for a hot breakfast, maybe not so great. Still the breakfast area downstairs is quite nice and I really never have been there when you had to wait. I think this is a great choice for Paris!", "Date": "February 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Newport Beach, California", "Title": "\u201cI'm the black sheep of reviewers\u201d", "Author": "Weeping_Tree", "ReviewID": "UR94873693", "Content": "I was e-mailed a survey after staying here in late January 2011 so I'm just going to cut and paste. Pro's: Great location. Nice Lobby. Unique Dining Space. Cons: No Wi-Fi in the rooms. For this sole reason I will not be staying at this location again. Concierge should have explained where to use Wi-Fi (you can in the lobby but are screwed downstairs in the dining/lounge area)... the hours and offerings of their limited breakfast. It would have been nice to be advised of some alternatives to go for breakfast in the neighborhood, should I have desired an expanded selection (toast/cereal/juice/coffee is not really breakfast).... All of the cafe's I checked out did not open until 8 AM. Elevator is literally for one person and a piece of luggage. If there are two of you, no matter your size, you will be able to tell what kind of toothpaste they use. Very claustrophobic. Once exiting the elevator you are literally two steps from your door. At least where I stayed (4th floor/Room 79) there were only two rooms on the floor. Again, this adds to the feeling of claustrophobia. The view from the room window looked into a courtyard. No direct sunlight, no view, not bad, but nothing to look at either. The room was very, very tight. Unequivocally good for one person only (and though I'm tall, I'm slim... No fatty American here :)) Couldn't imagine having a co-worker or even my girlfriend along. I would have raised the issue if one had been traveling with me. No partition in the shower. For the life of me I cannot understand why this is customary in France. Water sprays everywhere!!! I spent 10 mins drying everything off. What's possibly worse??? ... Having a shower hose that is meant for short(er) people. I'm 6' 3\" and the bloody hose only went up to my shoulder. There was no hinge to rest it on so not only did I feel like a monkey cleaning, I also felt like an acrobat in there. Hence water spraying everywhere. I'm not a clutz nor ignorant of a country's customs but come-on, really??? Lastly, I got screwed by the taxi driver on the way to the airport from the Hotel. I was placed into a cab that had been waiting for 10 mins for another guest. The meter was at 18 Euro within 2 mins after leaving the hotel (I didn't check it as soon as I entered.) I confronted the driver who said he didn't speak English but said something along the lines that \"this was customary\".... \"from Dispatch\" ??!!!. I obviously know this wasn't the case but had no option to abort the drive. I was running late and couldn't afford to risk finding another cab, let alone get into a huge argument with someone who claims to speak no English. That ride cost me 70 Euro's. I even tipped the bast*rd as I am one of \"those\" types.... He got me there safe and sound but totally screwed me in the process. This stay review was no reflection on this particular stay in France from me. I had a great time and some killer meetings. What pains me most is I had a pretty open budget, modest but open. I blame myself for not doing additional research. My first fail using Trip Advisor reviews.

The rooms: we were given the key (no cards here, which I kinda like) to our room. That particular room was very very small, and I am not overweight, or tall either. Now I understand the comments from previous reviewers about (some) room sizes, which up to now thought were out of proportion. This particular room, had one more disadvantage: it's window overlooked the reception area and had no natural light coming on (or it seemed that way to us). All in all a very claustrophobic room. So we asked to change, to which they happily agreed to. After been shown one more similar room, we were shown to a room overlooking the side street, which had plenty of natural light coming in. Exposed wooden beams & stone on the ceiling and wall respectively are a nice touch. But that's what their photos \"sell\" anyway. The girl receptionist was very nice, and recommended 2 restaurants of which one was closed due to National Armistice day, and the other was a revelation! (read my other contribution). What I have learnt from using trip-advisor and also contributing as a reviewer, is that peoples' perception of a hotel is 9/10 times dependant on how good they're overall travelling experience was . For instance an O.K hotel on a brilliant overall trip becomes \"the best hotel we've stayed in!! ever!! \" and a very good hotel on a romantic trip gone wrong, becomes \" the worst staffed hotel I have ever come across ...\" or something across these lines. I am no better, when it comes to reviews. It seems that emotion gets the better of us, and we review accordingly. If I were to be accurate and non biased by my lovely trip, then i'd have to say that this hotel comes highly recommended, for couples, or friends visiting the beautiful city that's Paris.

On our arrival the reception was courteous and professional. We couldn\u2019t check in until 3pm, the last inhabitants having left late\u2026no problem as there are bars and cafes directly outside. When we got our key we weren\u2019t shown to the room just directed \u2013 no problem with that but we did struggle in their tiny lift (elevator), 1 man and 1 bag was all it would take. There was access via a spiral staircase which was OK for us as our room was on the 1st floor facing the square and as anticipated was \u201ccompact\u201d but well designed. It was extremely clean and well maintained. The double glazing was superb \u2013 when the windows -which had bench seats set in the bays \u2013were open you got all the buzz from the people below and students entering the adjacent Sorbonne\u2026but close them a total silence\u2026amazing! The air con in the room was on as we had great weather but there was just a gentle \u201chummmmmm\u201d\u2026.and it kept the room cool perfectly. Breakfast was in the vaulted basement. It was OK\u2026 very basic and simple and cafeteria style\u2026you got a plastic try, helped yourself to OK coffee, croissant and pastries with the usual pre-packed jams etc a typical \u201ccontinental breakfast\u201d a la service stations on the auto routes\u2026its included in the room rate.

The room was extremely well prepared for our 2nd day \u2013 all credit to whoever does this. If you want a place to eat within easy walking distance then please visit La Maison du Jardin near the Senate at Jardin Luxembourg. It is both superb quality and value\u2026but you MUST book, its always full! We got a cab from the hotel back to the Eurostar at Gare du Nord and it again only cost 9 Euros \u2013 great value.

We arrived very early in the morning so we left our bags at the hotel and spent the day wandering around the city. Later that afternoon we returned to the hotel to check in and take a short break. I decided to lay down for a bit when I heard a quick knock on the door and before I could even answer, a man unlocked the door and came into my room! I quickly got up- luckily I hadn't gotten undressed- and when he saw how startled I was he went to the phone and made some excuse about how someone had reported the phone not working. He then said the phone was working and that it must have been another room. When my friend and I got together for dinner she said he'd done the same thing to her. We decided to report the incident, but the young man manning the front desk, though very courteous and friendly, said we'd have to wait and report it to the day shift. Luckily there was a chair in the room that I was able to jam up against the door since I wouldn't have been able to sleep otherwise (the door only had one lock, not the extra security lock the hotels have here). The next day I put the no disturb sign on my door since I didn't need the room cleaned and locked up my laptop in my bag. When we returned to the hotel that afternoon I found my door unlocked! My friend's was unlocked as well. Had we been staying longer (just stayed three nights) we would have moved to another hotel. On the train going out from Paris to our next destination I started getting a headache and guess what- the baggie with my medicines was missing! I didn't even have prescription meds- just the usual traveling stuff. Needless to say, even though the location is great and the staff friendly, I wouldn't recommend this hotel to anyone.

St Michel is a big station, many metro connections there, it's much more crowded. Both stations are about 5 minutes walk to the hotel. The hotel is sitting at the corner of a lovely plaza in front of Sorbonne University, only a few steps away from busy St. Michel Blvd, but really quiet.

It is a typical Paris hotel room, small but very clean. The bed is very comfortable. The bathroom is small too, but not worse than any other small hotels I stayed in Paris. My only problem with the room is the natural lighting. The only window for the room is not big, and near the entrance of the room. It is facing an inside courtyard,.So the room is quiet, but does not have too much natural lighting and almost no view (there is a plant in the window box, maybe tries to give some privacy, but blocks the lighting as well) Even during the day, I have to have the lights on if I am in the room. The breakfast is simply, but enough for someone like me, who is not an egg & meat eater for breakfast. It is typical Paris cafe breakfast, juice, coffee, toast, pastry. There are cereal, yogurt and fruit salad as well. The staff are very friendly and nice, all speak English well.

Second, They were doing a lot of construction above me which was VERY loud and caused drywall and dust to fall from the ceiling onto my bed. I'm pretty understanding in knowing that all hotels do have construction but I do feel like they have an obligation to customers to let them know prior to arrival or place them as far away as possible.

On the plus side: - The location is excellent, right on the Place de la Sorbonne, and not far from the metro. - The hotel is newly renovated with some chic/trendy design pieces in the common areas. So you get a good feel as you walk in. It feels cosy and warm. - The rooms are cosy and comfortable, but small. We got a superior room on an off-season deal on the net. This overlooked the square which was very nice. If the standard rooms are smaller, they must be very small indeed. - The staff are, in the main, very nice, friendly and helpful. On the negative side, they fell down on a lot of details: - We arrived early and wanted to leave our bags. We expected a storage room somewhere, but we were told to leave them in a public hallway which was out of sight of the receptionist. No ticket was given nor was any record kept. To be honest, anyone could have walked away with them. This is simply unacceptable at this level of hotel. It left a bad impression just when we were just starting our stay. - Internet wi-fi is free on the ground floor, but you have to pay if you want to use it upstairs! Again, at this level this sort of thing is just annoying. It meant people had to decamp down to the foyer in order to use the internet when they could simply be given the same code to use in their room. I felt like a child when I was told I had to come down with my laptop to the foyer before they would give me the code. Not the feeling I want on holiday when I'm paying hundreds of euros. Hotels in 2010 need to wake up and understand that paying extra for wi-fi annoys sooo many customers!! - The hotel seems to be a refurbishment job on an old hotel. It shows. Some of the rooms, corridors and stairs have odd-shapes and unexpected bumps and turns. For example, our room had a very odd-shaped bathroom which meant that there was a very small odd-shaped bath and only a hand-held shower head which could only be used if you sat down in the bath. It was very difficult (impossible!) to use this shower without some gymnastics and even then it resulted in wetting the whole floor, which in turn spilled right out into the bedroom as there was no door into the 'bathroom'. At this level of hotel you really expect a decent shower that works. - There was no room manual indicating the services the hotel offered. This seems a bit odd for this level of hotel. All in all, I think if you get a very good deal (we paid \u20ac120 for a superior room incl. breakfast) then you can overlook the details as the location etc. is spot on, and the feel of the hotel is good. However, if you are paying a lot more then I think the details will begin to annoy you. My sense is that their focus has been on the design (and presumably increased room rates as a result), but they haven't quite got to the level of detail needed to justify the high price level they are aiming at, as suggested by the rack rates posted on the back of the door.", "Date": "March 17, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brussels", "Title": "\u201cPerfect location, good value for money\u201d", "Author": "LaureAndCo", "ReviewID": "UR57393971", "Content": "Our room was small but very well organised and perfectly clean.

The neighboor caf\u00e9s are nice - the waiters greeted us everyday since we ate there the first night. The hotel is beautifully decorated - very modern and clean. The room was not exactly like the picture of course, and it's very small because its Paris! But it was the same style and had a nice bed and nice bathroom. Our room didn't really have a view, which would have been nice, but not necessary at all. It was very quiet at night and the drapes were dark so we slept long and well - in the mornings we could hear the neighboor a bit but nothing special. It was nice to be able to have breakfast in the hotel every morning, and there were some different things - I wasn't super-impressed though and it could've been nice to have breakfast in a caf\u00e9 one day, but since we already paid for it and it was so convenient and still very decent we had breakfast there all week. All in all - this hotel might be the best pick in Paris.

As most Parisian hotels are a let down in terms of the room size and quality, even in 4 and 5 star hotels, The Select Hotel is a real breath of fresh air. My wife was convinced I had booked a higher grade and more expensive hotel when we walked in and went to our room. The entrance to the hotel lies directly opposite the Sorbonne in a nice square with some restaurants and cafes (of varying quality) within easy reach on foot of either the Luxembourg or Saint Michel RER Stations (direct from Charles De Gaulle Airport). The first signs of quality lie in the very modern style of the reception area, and the pleasant welcome from the helpful staff. This continues throughout the hotel's main communal areas which are all well appointed with nice leather sofas and wooden fittings, especially the library/bar area. Our room was on the fifth floor overlooking the inner courtyard, but no real view to speak of. However, this was not a major concern for us given the quality of the room itself. Again, very modern fittings with quality woods and nice linen. The flatscreen TV and safe were also welcome additions. The only area where things could be improved is the bathroom, where there is no stand-up shower, rather a bath with shower attachment. Given the quality of everything else though, I am clutching at straws. Everything was clean on arrival and thoroughly every day by the maids. It is worth pointing out as well that we were in the lowest class of room! Another plus point for the hotel was the breakfast buffet, as many Parisian hotels charge extra for this, or do not include it at al. The fayre is very 'continental' in style with breads, cereals and excellent strong coffee, so those wanting something cooked or more traditional would have to look elsewhere. Finally, the hotel is in easy reach of a lot of the main sites, and a lot of nice restaurants (though keep an eye on the price increases as you walk down the hill towards Notre Dame as every 100 yards seems to add a Euro!) and cafes. Check out is suitably laid back at 12 o'clock at the latest so we had time to enjoy a relaxing breakfast and then pack and make our way home content.

After much deliberation I chose this hotel - and am happy I did so. The room we had (no 29 - Triple Room) at Select Rive Gauche compared very favourably with the business hotels (Meridian etc) in terms of space, cleanliness, quality of beds/bedding, sound proofing etc., and considerably better than the normal tired old Paris 3 star. Bathroom was spacious for a change - with bath, double sink & wc. Only complaint would be the lack of real shower - the shower is attached to the tap and can only be hand held - not even a hook on the wall. Breakfast thrown in is a bonus - it's not brilliant but is fresh & substantial, presented buffet style - so you can eat/drink as much as you want. Overall decor is modern and light, bar and sitting areas are attractive. All staff seemed friendly and with a good grasp of English ( although, as ever, any attempt at French is appreciated) Location is excellent - the square has cafes, sandwich shop & restaurants etc. Easy walk to the river and several main tourist attractions plus several metro lines to get to the rest. Some of the areas near the river are very \"touristy\" - very lively if that's what you want, but it's only a short stroll to the more traditional Paris if you prefer.

We had a reservation at another hotel in the area, but upon arrival we discovered that it was still partly under construction. We made the decision to stay elsewhere. We ended up booking the Select Hotel in a rush after reading reviews and looking at photos on TA and Expedia. The price was right and the location was spot-on. Upon arrival we were given a room that overlooked the plaza; however, it had not been renovated like the photos we'd seen, and only had a tub in bathroom. We requested a room with a shower, and were given room 76 on the back side of the hotel. Although the room was renovated, it didn't have the exposed stone, ceiling beams, shower and tub like we thought all the rooms had based on all the photos we'd seen. The room was comfortable enough, but we were dissapointed given what we were expecting. If you are going to stay here, I would request a \"Superior Room\". Location could not be better; you are close to the Metro, basically on top of the Sorbonne, a stones throw from St. Michel, Saint Germain, Notre Dame, an easy walk to Marais etc. You could get to anywhere in Paris in minutes. Breakfast included in the rate makes this a little better value for what you are paying. The staff was helpful, friendly and spoke great English; I believe they appreciate attempts at speaking French however, as most Parisans do.

We had to ask him how to get there and only pointed in the right direction and said \"2nd floor\". The heat wasn't working and we called him and he said \"it will come\"and then hang up before I could ask more questions.

On the good side, there is a nice atmosphere in the hotel: it's nicely designed and kept, and the staff are friendly and helpful. It's also in a great location... by the Sorbonne, 10 minutes(ish) walk from Notre Dame, 5 minutes from the Metro if that, plenty of bars and restaurants nearby. Rooms are also clean and well kept. On the less good, the room was basically not enough for the money. Of course, it's well understood that hotel rooms are generally on the small side in Paris, but for \u00a3140 per night you expect a bit more than a boxy room barely longer than the bed itself, even it's comfortable enough and clean. But this might have been acceptable, were it not for the lack of a proper shower. Just looking through other people's pics I see other rooms have this too.. we had a flat round disc showerhead, which attaches to the wall somewhere around your waist, meaning that you have to physically hold it to shower with it. This was frankly irritating - dunno about you, but I generally use both hands to shower with! Secondly, the cord wasn't quite long enough to get above your head (I'm 5'8\", so not a giant), so you had to crouch to shower your head. Maybe I'm just being picky? But I didn't like it. So all in all, I didn't feel it was value for money. Next time I'm in Paris I'll choose somewhere a little further out, and get something better for the cash. It looks as if the superior rooms are bigger, and if you're planning to book one of those perhaps you'll be completely happy with the place.

There is a Monoprix supermarket right down the road if you want to pick up snacks, drinks, or picnic items (the Luxembourg Garden, right down the street, is perfect for a picnic lunch).
