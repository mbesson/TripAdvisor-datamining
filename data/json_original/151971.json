It has a kitchen with fridge, electric stove, two bedrooms (1 full bed and 2 twin beds) and 2 bathrooms. TV with plenty of channels and a nice big balcony with a table and chairs. There's a barbecue pit just outside our cottage and the beach is just steps away. The pools were nice although the kids loved the beach more. The only complaint I have is the Wi-fi signal is very poor. I was told that I could sit in the playground across from the reception area and still get a wi-fi signal. Instead, I had to sit inside the reception closest to the desk to get a barely fair signal. There are a lot of restaurants and a bakery in the area.

We had unit 31 which is closest to the beach and obvioulsy, the Carribean waters. It was a modest ground floor unit decorated in 70's style but very clean and has a small cement porch. There is another unit above but it was vacant. The unit consisted of 3 rooms...main living area and kitchen combo...with a fridge and 4 burner stove with oven..they provide a few pots, utensils, can opener...very basic..but there was frozen ice in the two ice cube trays which was a treat for a cold refreshment( which we had with us) after a long day of touring. Just pull up a seat at the kitchen island on one of the three bar stools and sip away. There is also a small wicker couch, chair and TV.which has a good channel selection. Also a small table and two chairs. The bedroom consisted of clean sheets and a dresser, closet and a single and a double bed with a window AC which worked marvelously(if you like air conditioning). Off the bedroom is a bathroom..the shower is large and everything worked. It is not the ritz but the location was phenomenal. Quiet and set back in a little from the sand beach. They have wi fi in the main office and a few things like dish soap, books, sun tan or sun block..whatever your preference. There is a barbecue pit outside beside the unit and also some tables and chairs outside under a cabana. Overall, we enjoyed our stay very much, the staff was friendly, the price was great and it provided us options for meals and basic necessities. I would recommend this villa for a family or couples or even a group of friends and it will not kill your pocket book. You can walk to all kinds of restaurants, liquor stores and supermarkets.

The sign just said \"Villa Antonio\" so it was a little confusing in finding it. I have never written a review for any place that we stayed, but felt that I should for this hotel so that others would not have the same disappointing experience that we had on our vacation.My husband and I booked five nights at this hotel in February. We were not expecting anything fancy, but the room that we were given left a lot to be desired. We were provided with a room on the second floor of a two-story building in what the repeat hotel guests called \"The Cell Block\". It appeared that many of the guests came back year after year. They were very friendly and helpful about the hotel, and the area in general. The room was advertised as a one bedroom apartment. As soon as we walked into the \"apartment\", we knew that we made a mistake. The room was very small, plain and old. Although, we usually don't worry too much about the room as long as it is clean and nicely appointed since we don't spend much time in a room, it was a bit claustrophobic. Guests should also not expect much in the way of amenities in these rooms. The kitchen was on what was once a screened in porch. The kitchen cabinets were old, and in disrepair. There were two plates, two cups, and a few utensils in the kitchen. The room was air conditioned with a window unit that stuck out in the \"kitchen\" so that the hot air was blowing on you when you were in that \"room\". We went to the office, and explained that we were not happy with our room. I have to say that the hotel office staff could not have been any nicer about the situation. I expect that we were not the first to have this issue. We had to pay for the room for one night, and they said that we could cancel our reservation for the remainder of the week. They offered us a two bedroom apartment which was in the back of the resort or a suite at the same price that we paid. We took the suite which was very basic, but much nicer It also had a very nice view of the ocean, and a wonderful porch to sit out on to eat or relax while watching the surf. The suite was only available for that night. so we booked the hotel next door, and moved the next morning. The beach in this area is nice, but very narrow, and was really washed away in front of the hotel.

The very first day, after a 2 1/2 hr drive from San Juan, we went to the pool and asked some folks basking in the sun there for a nearby grocery. Soon we found ourselves with a new family of friends, going to one unit for ice cream social, to the deck over the ocean for \"sunset toasting\", and to a great potluck and cocktail party hosted by the owner. These folks have been coming to Villa Antonio, some for over 40 years. Everyone, including staff and owner, were friendly, helpful and charming. The Parador is older, but very clean, and fully outfitted if we had wanted to cook. The ocean was a step away, and the grounds were lovely. Bad points? Well, not anyone's fault that the normally flat ocean in front of the hotel was affected by heavy storms in the U.S. and was almost unswimmable, until you got outside the surf line. The folks there recommended a public beach a few miles south and it was protected, deserted and wonderful. The hotel pool was a bit chilly, but then, it was winter.

It was difficult to understand why such a prime located property was in such poor condition. Who is in charge of maintenace here? And why are they still employed? I suggest they get it together and make some serious changes. The place has so much potential , they need to clean house!

Unfortunately, if you choose air conditioning for the bedroom, it exhausts the hot air into the kitchen/porch through an AC unit covered with dust and mold. On the first floor were a number of retired couples who had clearly moved in for the winter and there were constant cooking smells. The beach is lovely, but on the second morning, a school bus pulled into the driveway and let 30 people off to have a picnic in the pavilion on the beach- complete with loud radios, laughter, more smoking, and filling up all the space to sit. This would have been okay for the public beach down the road, but not at this private property. It was impossible to read a book, much less relax. At night, the security guards walked around (also smoking) and with their walkie talkies blaring. We could only tolerate 2 nights of our planned 4 day stay and left.

The \"cottage\" is a little misleading as it is not free standing - the building is actually a 4-plex of 2 bedroom units, but it is beach front. The owners keep the property well maintained. The interior of the rooms could use a little work. The kitchen/living room/dining room is a bit small to prepare large scale meals - and you will need to bring your own pots and pans. However, it is great for breakfast, lunch and snacks. The bedrooms were also small, but we spent little time there. Each bedroom has a window unit air conditioner, which we used for 2 of the 4 nights. The breeze from the sea was sufficient to keep the room cool for the 2 other nights. The patio is incredibly large and where we spent most of our time. The breeze from the ocean was cool, and if there had been hooks for a hammock, we might have slept outdoors. Lighting on the patio was bright enough so you could sit outside in the evenings and read. The beach in front of the parador is great for swimming. The waves sound huge, but are small - they just break close to shore. One of the reasons for not turning on the a/c is to be able to listen to the surf at night. Bring your own beach towel. The Villa Cofresi is on one side of the Villa Antonio and we enjoyed dinner there. However, there was a large group there and it was incredibly noisey. We were so happy we were not staying there. The Rincon of the Seas is on the other side. It was also nice for dinner. The entire Rincon area was very quiet - it appeared to us that many of the hotels/guest houses were practically empty. Many of the restaurants were closed, as were the many of the surf shops. Apparently, a number of places close in September and then reopen in late October/early November. We looked for a handicraft store, but did not find one. The Lazy Parrot has some handicrafts and jewelry and Casa Islena had a very very small amount. The first day we were there, there was surf in front of Tamboo Tavern, but it was flat the rest of the time.

The beach is relatively calm, but be careful with rocks near the shoreline, the entire coastline here is rocky, but certainly swim-able. The beach is somewhat narrow with alot of other accommodations as far as the eye can see. Explore some of the other nice beaches such as escalera (steps) beach, a short drive away.

The beach is literally on the property and although small, it is quiet and perfect for sun-bathing and gentle wave-riding. There is an excellent taco stand across the street with an adjoining liquor store- stock up on Bacardi, it is cheap! We made our own drinks and had moon-lit chats on the beach...very romantic. Make sure you catch the sun-set on the deck at the Parador; BYOB and snacks to share- you'll get to know the other guests.

The parador has a great location -- very close to the center of town, restaurants, shopping, and of course the surfing beaches. The staff was friendly and helpful, and the daily maid service was flexible about working around our schedule. We stayed in the two bedroom beachfront villa for $145 per night -- a good value for Rincon, which can be a bit pricey. The furnishings were a little worn around the edges, but the rooms were clean and quiet, and the A/C and everything else worked OK. The mosquitoes were a bit of a problem, but you quickly learned to keep the screen door shut. The kitchenette included a full-size refrigerator, stove, pots, pans and utensils; we bought food at the local supermarket and made our own breakfast and lunch every day which saved us money. The beach in front of the parador was kept clean and was great for walking; the ocean sunsets were magnificent. The pool was a bit small, but it was always clean and usually not crowded. There are two tennis courts, at least one of which was always available. The parador does not have a restaurant, but there are quite a few good restaurants within walking distance or a short drive. The hotel next door has a great beachfront bar. The surfing beaches are only 5 to 10 minutes away by car; we found the best waves at Maria's Beach and Domes. We were among just a few US mainland tourists staying at the parador; the majority of its customers appeared to be well-to-do Puerto Rican families from San Juan or elsewhere around the island. We found Rincon and the Parador Villa Antonio to be very relaxing and enjoyable, and we would certainly go back there again.", "Date": "June 6, 2003"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Parador Villa Antonio", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g264369-d151971-Reviews-Parador_Villa_Antonio-Rincon_Puerto_Rico.html", "Price": "$92 - $157*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Road 115, Km 12.3</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Rincon</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">00677</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Puerto Rico</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "151971", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/83/6e/836e4fda7d1c27e8ddefa01c90a80b334large.jpg"}}
