We arrived at the hotel around 1030 hrs. Our room was not yet available; so we stored our luggage in a locked room and walked down to the Plaza Catalunya and and to the large department store, El Corte Inglis. We window shopped, bought a few snacks at the grocery store in the basement of El Corte Inglis and returned to the hotel around noon. Our room was ready and David, the front desk receptionist, checked us in. Let me say that, as a veteran traveler, I have faced receptionists that are wonderful and some that emerge from the bowels of Hades. David was one of the most courteous, professional and informative desk managers that I have ever had the opportunity to meet. He greeted me each morning as I emerged from the elevator to go down the block to get coffee for my wife and answered many questions that we had about touring the city. Now, on to the hotel and room, The hotel exterior and lobby are exactly as pictured on TA. The marble makes for a beautiful entry. Our room faced the Rambla and had a small balcony. I chose this location knowing that we may hear street noises late into the night. While this was true when we had the french doors open, it was very minimal when the doors were closed. We truly enjoyed the view of the street; so we have no complaints. The room was minimally decorated; but extremely functional and comfortable. It was spotlessly cleaned each day and was large enough for the two of us to move around easily. We found the computer on the first floor to be accessible most of the time we chose to use it; and if we had to wait, it was only for a short time. We did not eat breakfast at the hotel; so I cannot comment on it. One evening, I realized that I had misplaced my power adaptor for my camera. When I inquired at the front desk, the young lady offered the use of one that the hotel had. Each and every staff member I met was quite affable during our stay. From our first encounter with David when we arrived until he secured a taxi for the ride to the port, he was always smiling and pleasant. He is a real asset to the hotel staff. The architecture of the interior of the hotel, a towering open staircase and the abundance of marble and hardwoods do amplify voices and doors closing; but it was not annoying enough to comment on. Would I stay here again. Absolutely Yes!

First impressions weren\u2019t great, as we were greeted rather sullenly by the receptionist, who informed us that we\u2019d arrived fifteen minutes too early to check in. However, when the rooms were ready we found them to be modern, spacious and spotlessly clean. We had booked into two rooms \u2013 one at the front of the hotel (Room 504) that overlooked Rambla de Cayalunya and one to the rear of the building (Room 505) with a window that overlooked the central atrium. Both were on the fifth floor. We asked for one quiet room and hence were given the one to the rear. I stayed in the room to the front of the hotel and really enjoyed watching the world go by from the french windows. Although the rooms to the rear of the hotel are sold as being the quiet ones, we found that with being on the fifth floor, even the rooms at the front of the hotel were quiet enough and we were never disturbed in the night. On the whole we found the staff to be very pleasant and helpful. The breakfast was very similar to most continental hotels, with plenty to choose from, although no rotation in what was served. This hotel has to be in one of the best locations in Barcelona. It was a two/three minute walk from the Aerobus (airport shuttle bus) stop, and barely any distance from the Ramblas. If you\u2019re in Barca for a few days or more we\u2019d recommend buying a two day ticket for the open top buses that travel around the city between the main tourist attractions. These are cheaper than hiring a taxi and much safer than using the Metro (beware of pickpockets). The definite highlight of this hotel was the rooftop swimming pool. Although only fairly small, it was great for cooling off in at the end of the day. The only inconvenience that we came across with this hotel was that there was no safe in one of the rooms. Apparently it was broken and away being fixed, but we stayed for nearly a week and it was never returned. As our party was in two rooms, we were able to put all of our passports and money in one safe, but anyone booking into only the one room would have been stumped.

There is also a very small gym. We had breakfast included as part of our package - it was a cold buffet with some hot eggs and tortialla and sausages. Whilst the breakfast was fine (would have got bored with it if we had stayed more than 4 nights as same every day) the member of staff who served teas/coffees was rather sourely and we felt guilty asking for more drinks - although we got over that! On the same floor as the breakfast room there is free internet access which hardly seemed to be used. We had a great time in this hotel and would go back even if it was a bit more basic than some of the other hotels we have stayed in.", "Date": "July 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oakland, CA", "Title": "\u201cExcellent location\u201d", "Author": "Frank&Norah", "ReviewID": "UR114911789", "Content": "Great location: near the action and still quiet.

This was our first trip to Barcelona, so we wanted a hotel that was close to the city centre, with everything easily accessible. We got the train from BCN airport to \"passage de gracia\", and from here it was only a 5 minute walk to the hotel. It took 10 minutes the first time as we were unsure of its location, but apart from that, there were no real issues. Once we got to the hotel, the guy behind the desk was very polite and helpful and even allowed us to check in nearly 2 hours early. He even offered to print off the bus timetable to Girona (our return flights were from Girona airport as it was half the price). The only complaint I would have at this point was the fact that once we got to our room , we noticed that it was 2 single beds pushed together. We went downstairs to explain that we had asked for a double room, and he told us that there were none left. That was fine. The problem was the fact that he didn't have the courtesy to tell us beforehand. Anyway.... The hotel itself was very clean and tidy. The lobby had a small seating area, where you could sit and use the hotel's free wi-fi(only on ground floor). The room was big and had evrything you expect a room to have; bedside table, wardrobe, tv, desk, etc. The bathroom was lovely with plenty of space and had soap, towels, and shampoo which was good. Our room was facing out on to the main sreet, and noise levels were actually lower than we had expected(Thursday night and Friday night). The top floor was home to a (smallish) outdoor pool and sunbeds, but the weather was slightly on the breezy side for us to make use of these. It was a typical European breakfast ( croissants, fruit, yoghurt, cheese, ham, etc.) and this was more than enough to get you started for the day. If breakfast is not included, then I would maybe suggest eating elsewhere so that you have a bit more variety. When you walk in to the breakfast room, the lady asks you if you would like tea or coffee, which is nice. However, the reaction you get when you ask for another one is not so nice, to say the least. She did comply, but slightly unwillingly, or so it seemed. Location-wise, you'll be hard pressed to find a place situated more central to all the sights in the centre. Las Ramblas is a 5 minute walk away, and the marina is maybe 15/20 minutes away, but you walk straight down Las Ramblas so do not realise as you'll be taking in the surroundings. Gothic area is around 10/15 minutes away, and for everything else you can just use the simple metro system. I would definately reccommend this this hotel for first timers' in BCN, as evrything you will need is within close proximity. Look around for special deals!

We were pleasantly surprised that the location was incredibly convenient, right down the street from Plaza de Catalunya and a block from the Ramblas. Even better, they had a room available at 10AM so we did not have to check our luggage and return later to get our room. The day was quite hot - over 90 degrees farenheit and we noticed that the lobby was rather warm. The desk clerk told us that they were having problems with the lobby A/C. When we went up to our room, we found it to be quite warm as well. We turned the A/C up to maximum fan and lowest temperature and went out. We told the clerk and he said they were waiting for a technician. Our A/C worked very very poorly for the three days of our stay. One clerk even gave us a room key to put in the energy-saver slot so we could keep the AC on all day, but even that did not help. They kept telling us that they were waiting for a technician. Finally, on our last morning, they offered us a new room, but my husband did not want to bother repacking all of our luggage for one night. On the good side, this hotel was very clean and the room was quite spacious. The bathroom was marble and there was lots of space in there as well. Our package included breakfast which was served in a pleasant, sunny room. It was quite plentiful including both hot and cold dishes and certainly more than adequate to keep us going until a late lunch. However, if breakfast is not included in your room, I would not spend more than 5 or 6E pp because you can go down the street on the Ramblas to the marketplace and get a really great breakfast for very little money. The hotel also offered free Internet access in a computer in the lounge which was a great ammenity. When we checked out, we asked for consideration on our bill due to the fact that our room was hot during this extremely hot weather spell. We were told that because we had a great price which included breakfast, they could not reduce our bill any further. I asked for the email for the management of the Onix chain and the desk clerk gave me that. Upon arriving home, I found an email from her correcting the information she had given me which was quite nice of her. Bottom line, I emailed them and never heard anything back at all.
