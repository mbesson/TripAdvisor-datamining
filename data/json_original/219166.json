We had an issue where some one tried to Getting in to our room two nights in a row the 1 st night at 4:30am and the other at 6:00am waking the baby both times we called the front desk and they sent security we ended up changing rooms and it didn't happen again. My only concern was how no one seemed to care the front desk said that it could not be a poor person so we should not worry???? Not sure what he meant by this and our sun wing rep was too busy to even hear about it.

First of all this is not really a 5 star hotel should be 4, but very good none the less. We picked this hotel mainly due to its proximity to playa del carmen. The hotel was clean and the staff very friendly and helpful. What we enjoyed most was the food, if you love seafood you will be in heaven! We ate fish, shrimps, squid, mussels and scallops every night. For the a la Carte restaurant we only enjoyed the Asia one, buffet was better than the rest of the others. We went to XelHa and enjoyed it very much and do recommend. We also went to cozumel with ferry and discovered the Island by scooters for about 22$. Not great place but we enjoyed the day of beach hopping.

Food i thought, was very good, quite varied, from salads to pasta, chicken, beef, pork you name it the hotel had it. They have theme nights like most hotels, i loved the night we had a chocolate fountain, with marshmellows and fresh fruit. There are 3 al-acart resturants in the hotel, Asian, steak, which i highly recommend and an italian (this is down at the Yakatan hotel), i didnt try this one as the steakhouse was that good. The rooms were quite spacious, with a fridge and optics, tv,(Excellent English movies every night) the only down side about the room was, there is no kettle, to make that all important cuppa in a morning, but after a long search and an hour journey into Cancun we found a huge shopping complex, (FANTASTIC!) where i brought a very nice kettle. The Beach is huge (you access this by either using the golf cart or a 5 minute stroll) via the riu yakatan, plenty of sun beds and you have your lunch down there also. At the beach you can go parragliding, scuba diving, and jet skiing, at a cost, roughly about 55 dollars, for the jetskis.The entertainment was a bit hit and miss, quite funny at times, especially karaoke night, but the outdoor bar is fab, cocktails flow and i must say the beer wasnt bad niether, and it was a nice cold beer. If you didnt like the entertainment outside, they have light entertainment in the lobby.

The resort was very clean. Never had trouble getting chairs for the pool. We took the shuttle to the beach a few times. The room was great and we got mattress pads for the beds and slept wonderfully. Ate at all of the ala cartes and thought the Asian was the best but they were all good. There was always plenty of choices of food at each meal and we found it better than a RIU we had stayed at before. Water pressure was great in the shower. Had trouble finding an ice machine near our room. Saw lots of the animals mentioned in previous reviews. Some days had more than others. They won't bother you but it is a little scary. Saw a few of the evening shows, some were cheesy but the young people really work hard and you see them during the day as well. Enjoyed meeting people from England, Germany, Canada and others. Very few Americans at this resort the week we were there. Walked to Starbucks and shopping area a few times. Couldn't believe how close it was. It is just next door to the resort. Made a nice evening stroll as well. Closer walk than the beach. We loved Playa Del Carmen and walked the beach to town once but took a cab back. The weather was perfect every single day - averaging 85 mid-day. We had a massage but had to walk to the Yucatan for that. We ate lunch at the Yucatan and Playacar so we could compare the resorts. We will go back to the area again but will try to stay at PlayaCar. We liked the smaller size of that resort and visited it a couple of times.

The grounds are so nice reminds me of a rain forest. Lots of animals. I didn't really see the hoard of those raccoon looking things that others commented about. They did come around but lucky us I guess there was no one feeding them. Check out the monkeys at the Yucatan....so cool.... the staff is so great friendly always going the extra mile. I asked for bath towels in our room as I think the maid forgot to put two in our room. With-in 5 minutes they where at my door with fresh towels....excellent!!!! the staff at the pool are so great the boys had a great time playing all the pool activities. I even got involved....They had an excellent time the shows are really good they put great efforts...see the Michael Jackson show was pretty good. The food....well what can I say...I gained 10 pounds I guess that says it all just fabulous...nothing to complain about....You got to try the stake house Beach OMG.....so beautiful...Yes it's a 5 minute walk to the beach as this is not a beach side resort, but I liked the walk. Plus you get to use the amenities for the other Riu's except the Palace and we just did that. Plan for the whole day park yourself at the beach or pool of the Yucatan. it's a great....we went in the morning had breakfast stayed at the beach and the boys went to both the beach and pool as the pool is right near the beach. The food quality at the Yucatan is not as great as the Tequila, but for breakfast and lunch it's actually better than other places I stayed so no complaints there. The Riu Plyacar is the smallest of the resorts and I found it very quite and mostly older people so if you like quite that's the place for you The Tequila is the busiest at night. The shows are better and we have a disco and sports bar. The kids loved the sports bar. to young for the disco... I would definitely come back to this place it's not a 5 star as some small perks are missing such as room service, bath robes, and they don't give out bottled water except for big bottles in the room which they stock up daily.

We flew direct out of Toronto on AirTransat - flights were on time both ways. We used USA Transfers for transportation to hotel and back - excellent service! The resort was completely full but it did not feel too crowded. We paid $1336 cad pp (including taxes and air and transfers) for 9 nights over Ontario March break and were very happy with the value. Notes: Canadian tour companies (Sunwing, Signature) rate this hotel as a 5 star resort - it is not. Expedia rates it as 3.5 stars and that is what it is - a very solid 3.5 stars. The rooms are extremely clean - large shower and very comfortable. The dinner buffet is one of the best we've eaten at. Breakfast was excellent (but every resort we've been to has a great breakfast buffet). Lunch was just okay. It is a 5 minute (very pleasant) walk to the beach. There are lots of chairs but no palapas so shade is scarce. The beach is beautiful - one of the best! In my opinion, it is as nice (or nicer) than Punta Cana! We really liked the feel of the Playcar complex - very tropical and safe feeling. Making reservations for dinner at the a la cartes was a little inconvenient but we get up early and we never had a problem getting a reservation. We enjoyed the steak house the best. There is no drink service on the beach or at the pool - we did not find this a problem and there were no long waits at any of the bars. One day, they brought a variety of drinks to the beach and rang a bell so you could get one if you wanted. The entertainment was the same as it is at every resort - sometimes good but mostly just okay. The kids (teenagers) enjoyed the sports bar and the disco too - you must be 18 to go to the disco. The after hours food (in the sports bar) is not very good - just sandwiches and pizza in a bar fridge - but it was handy if there was nothing else available. we grabbed some on our way to the airport and ate it while we waited. The kids also used the gym and said it was good. A huge THANK YOU to Miguel for his excellent service at the front desk when their internet service was disabled. All in all - we thought RIU Tequila provided excellent value for the price we paid and we would absolutely go back if the price was right!

We all did two excursions - the first to Xcaret, a great place where we snorkeled, spent time on a beautiful beach, enjoyed a very nice buffet lunch (included). Swimming with dolphins was offered, many different animals and parrots throughout the very large area. A comfortable bus picked us up and drove us back to our hotel. A horse show and a Myan show was began at 5:30 in the afternoon. The horse show was good, the Myan Show not quite as much. Our second excursion was Dolphinia, swimming with the dolphins which was amazing. I am a 70 year old grandma, and I enjoyed all of these activities. Our room was on the first floor, right across from the pool, a short walk to the buffet and a pleasant walk, or golf cart ride to the wonderful beach.

How some people have rated this hotel as terrible is beyond me. We are both in our late 20's and this Hotel catered for every age. Hotel itself very nice upon arrival after the eternity of flight, arrived just before dinner time and reception dealt with us very quickly. Handed a nice refreshing drink while we checked in. Stayed in room 3116, a tad dated but very big, spacious and everything you need. Yes the shower has no light but it's not like your showering in the dark! our room was an upper room which was perfect. Only thing that annoyed me was the banging of the doors early in the morning, there heavy doors so the echo was twice as loud. Maid service every day was great. The Buffett restaurant had so much variety it was amazing, the fresh fruit to the different themed nights was great to try new food or if you like your home comforts, pizza and chips were there every night. We dined in the steak restaurant which was amazing! By far the best steak I have had for a while. The beach is a 10 minute walk or a shuttle ride. lovely walk down there and you can only gasp in amazement at the beauty of it, clear blue sea and sand that goes on and on. Lovely restaurant for lunch, never an issue with seating. Drinks on tap. Sun loungers are no problem to find. We never went to the hotel pool as the beach if far better but it seemed very busy. They do the games and things there which looked fun. If you travel with first choice the rep will give you a list of things to do. We went on the fat cat catermaran and would defy recommend this! it can be pricey but why not. Entertainment in the hotel was ok, some great nights but one was so rubbish we left. They do work hard and you see them during the day learning routines etc. Tipping... This for me was a total nightmare, I was so worried about it before we left. It is courtesy to tip. We tipped our housekeeper everyday with 20-30 pesos. The guys who dropped off our suitcases we tipped the same. At the bars we tipped the odd 20 pesos which remember is \u00a31 in English money. The guys will try to get you to tip who take you on the coach back to the airport but that's up to you. We never tipped at dinner but we did see some people do it. It's up to you really but do expect some tipping. Finally the weather was beautiful and hot everyday. What more can you ask for. A truly amazing honeymoon an we're already looking to rebook.

Ride from airport was longish \u2013 a little more than an hour \u2013 we stopped at 5-6 hotels before getting there. Check in took us less than 5 minutes \u2013 thanks to Miguel at the front desk. He was warm and friendly. We got the room we had requested upon booking (close to lobby, upper level). It was clean and quiet, close to everything \u2013 pool, lobby, and buffet and beach. Beach is only 5 minutes walk. We never needed to take the shuttle. Beach has plenty of available sun beds, no matter what time of the day. It was clean and well kept. Food was nice. The buffet was huge and had lot of choices. We tried the Asian and Mexican La Carte \u2013 good flavor and variety. The drinks were a little water downed but we are not big drinkers so didn\u2019t care. You may get a little tired of the buffet food toward the end so you should mix it up between the buffet, La Carte and some local restaurants (BTW: restaurants in the town, 5th avenue, may be a bit pricey). Book early in the morning for La Carte, there may be a line. It is a 20 minute walk ($7 taxi ride) to the 5th avenue in Playa Del Carman \u2013 lots of shopping, cuisine and interaction with locals \u2013 don\u2019t hold back on bargaining. We also visited the local Walmart and Chidraui (local superstore) \u2013found great variety and prices on chilli sauces and Tequila. We did two excursions \u2013 Coba and Chichen Itza \u2013 both are great if you are into history and culture. Chichen Itza is a little far \u2013 3 hours each way \u2013 but well worth it, especially if you find a guide as good as ours. Coba is fun too since you get to climb a 45 meter pyramid and enjoy the spectacular view from the top. We booked our tours at the Walmart. We paid about $50-55 per person for each one after aggressively bargaining for the best price. If you use the travel representative in the hotel\u2019s lobby you would be paying about twice the amount. The nightly entrainment was top class.

It was about a 40 minute ride from the airport to the lobby where we were greeted with drinks & took a look around and had lunch and our rooms were then ready. The lobby is beautiful with a nice solarium sitting area. Just off the lobby is the buffet breakfast/dinner restaurant, the Theatre, two lobby bars and a sports bar with internet. The grounds were full of tropical trees, flowering shrubs and cactus. All of the buildings were two storey and well maintained. The maid service was excellent. The pool area was very nice and always full of activities. I must say that this is the first resort we've stayed at that enforced the no reserving chair policy due to people tying up chairs that weren't used for hours. There were a few of these coatis (a cross between a racoon/possum) that walked around looking for food, but didn't appear to bother anyone. We stuck to the buffet restaurant for meals due to the big variety that was very good. I also want to mention our waiter, Rengal who was very friendly and always playing jokes with people. The activity people, also were performers in the theatre on many nights and put on great shows. Some of them are Kenny, Alberto, Adele and Fabio. It was very nice to have lunch with many of them during our stay and share many stories. Speaking of shows, there was a Michael Jackson show and an Elvis show that were both great. For those that like shopping , there is a nice flea market only a 5 minute walk for the hotel. And for those seeking more shopping, 5th Avenue in Playa is only a $7 cab ride and less than 10 minutes away. We did the XPlor tour and had a blast on the 14 zip lines and driving the 4 wheelers thru the bush & underground caves. The tour also included swimming in the underground cenota and rafting in an underground cave. In our opinion, this is definitely a 4.5 star resort with excellent dining, nice clean rooms with a stocked fridge & mini bar, lush landscaping, friendly staff and a very nicely setup resort that has everything a short walk from the lobby.", "Date": "March 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "melton mowbray", "Title": "\u201cfantastic holiday\u201d", "Author": "karen r", "ReviewID": "UR125856808", "Content": "lovley quiet hotel ,lovley style bungalows /bathrooms abit dark and pocky/but absolutly spotless cleaned everyday for us,enough american channels on tv even got frazer,loss of seats when your ready to eat ,great asian resturant /right mix of family and couples ,no noise at night ,never really ran out of anything,all staff in and around hotel were top notch very careing and honest people ive ever had the pleasure to meet nelly our cleaner and jessica from reception but everyone was lovley,fresh food good mix of food ,tea and coffee good ,the birds are a pain though all ove rthe tables so eat inside if it would bother you ,but we wasnt,we did get a fre upgrade to the riviera maya palace better food on beach but no thing happening at night and we were given terrible room would dafo go back next year possible riu palace not the maya though unless better room was given", "Date": "March 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York, NY", "Title": "\u201cThe review that tells it like it is, worth the read\u201d", "Author": "Paxter", "ReviewID": "UR125827715", "Content": "Quick background: traveled with my wife and 2 kids 7 & 5, and we've been to several all-inclusives in the past. Hotel is about 40 minute trip to the airport, I strongly suggest using a private shuttle/taxi company. We used Cancun Shuttle and they were fairly priced, punctual and professional. We met a couple from Canada who used a shuttle that was packaged into their vacation and it stopped at pretty much every hotel along the way, said they spent almost the whole 1st day on that airport shuttle (and they paid as much as we did for our private taxi- I got wife points here cha-ching!). Check-in was smooth and the front desk was accomodating. The grounds are quite nice and the upkeep is noticeable. Room was ok, for 2 adults and 2 small kids, not ok for 2 adults 2 teens. The AC keeps your room a cool 80 degrees. The thermostat is cranked to 60 degrees, but that was not happening. I complained to the front desk twice, and they said they'd send someone to fix it, but they never showed up, oh well. Other than the lack of AC, no other complaints about the room. Kudos for not smelling damp as in my other resorts. You get a fridge stocked with sodas/seltzer/tonic water/ and bottled water. There is also a unit mounted on the wall with 5 different types of alcohol, ya know should you need an emergency shot outside of the many bars. Pool is ok, nothing to write home about. Food, as in most all inclusives is very hit or miss. We booked reservations for: the steakhouse, chinese and mexican restaurants. The steakhouse was a joke, you can get a better quality steak at a beat-up outdated diner. The steak was dry, tasteless and rubbery. We looked forward to the Mexican restaurant, given that we were in Mexico. Again, huge dissapointment, I got the impression that the food services department thinks that if they deep fry everything, it should taste better... it was horrid. I'm from New York where the worst Mexican restaurant would be considered 100 times better than this garbage (guaranteed). Skip the beans altogether, trust me. BTW the Mexican restaurant is not located in the Tequila, it's about a 15 minute walk to another nearby RIU resort. The asian restaurant on the other hand was a pleasant surprise: half-way descent sushi rolls, teriyaki chicken skewers, shrimp in curry sauce... we ate here twice. The breakfast and dinner buffets are at the same location. Breakfast left much to be desired- I'm a big coffee person, and this coffee but barely drinkable, yuk. The coffee was so unappealing, that I found myself at the instant cappucino machine to make up for it. The breakfast croissants were a little on the dry and tasteless side. Dinner at the buffet was actually not bad. Alot of different options to choose from, and the real fruit smoothies are amazing. Again, about 1/2 of everything at the dinner buffet is deep fried in what I gather is cheap overused oil. Halfway through my trip my stomach had had enough, lots of bloating, twisting and cramping. I decided to cut out the fried stuff from there on, and things quickly turned around. As you may already know, the beach is a good 10 to 15 minute walk. Lots of chairs and palm trees, water was a little cold for my liking so I just laid in the shade and read. Shopping is available nearby at outdoor shopping court right outside of the resort (note the resort is inside a gigantic gated community called Playacar, so you can safely walk outside of it's perimeter, but there isn't much out there besides this outdoor shopping court and touristy residential houses). The shopping here consists of small souvenirs/alcohol/ a pharmacy etc... EVERYTHING and I mean EVERYTHING is overpriced here and negotiating will not do much for you (and I'm fluent in spanish). Thing is, these people have no competition and the tourists will pay the price that is asked, so why should they settle for less money? I walked away. The animation crew/staff work hard, and are good at what they do. The men are respectful, polite and funny (unlike some Dominican resorts i've been too where the men constantly flirt with the female guests). The entertainment is ok, the usual lip-syncing, choreography... meh... I had no complaints though, they try hard and the guests filled all the seats and seemed content. There is wildlife on the premises, one of the nearby RIU resorts has monkeys, and capibara(not sure of the spelling), ours had 2 iguanas, crows, and a pretty big population of what the staff referred to as tejones (though I found out this generally means badger, which this animal is not). It is, in actuality a Coati. The staff said it's native to Mexico but I found out it isn't (though it is found in many South American countries south of Panama). We at first felt this animal added an exotic feature to the resort, and even deemed it cute. 2 days into our trip though, we began to view these things as a real nuisance. The females roam about in packs, day and night foraging for any kind of food (trash cans and your plate included) the males are loners who do the same. If you are laying by the pool guard your drink, they will knock it down and sip it off the floor. If you try walking from the lunch buffet back to your pool chair, good luck, by the time you turn around there will be a pack of these things surrounding you. If you try yelling or chasing these things they move 3 steps away and come right back, this time closer. I saw women abandon their' food and head for protection. Imagine a big population of daring racoons (same family) set free on a resort and you get the picture. In the end they are harmless, but a nuisance nevertheless. Maybe the population on the resort should be cut down to 10? Most of the lovely guests I met were returning to this resort for the 4th, 5th or 6th time. I could see why too. There is an overall happiness here, the smell, the groundwork, the staff and the guests are all generally in a happy and talkative mood making for a relaxed scenic environment. Above all, this resort has value ($$$). It would be hard to find a resort that provides all of this, this well, for these prices. I believe you get more value for your buck here because of it's 15 minute proximity to the beach, which in the end... was fine with me.

The resort was a solid 4.5 star and we would return in a heartbeat. The lobby area is large and inviting, check-in was very quick, we traveled with another couple and were given rooms next to each other without having to ask. We were in one of the furthest buildings, it was very quiet, room was clean and comfortable, shower with loads of pressure and hot water, good maid service, nice balcony with a screen door which was great. Lots of vegetation on site was nice, we did not mind the animals as they were not aggressive and did not bother us. Service everywhere at the resort was super, friendly and helpful, we never had to wait for a drink and did not feel like we had to tip constantly. A la carte's were ok, Oriental was very good but Steakhouse was average. Buffets, both in the main dining room and near the pool at lunch time, were great. Good opening hours, tons of variety, fresh food, tasty, not a bad thing to say about it! Drinks at the bars were also good, it was nice to see a drink menu if we wanted to try something different. Pool was well maintained, lots of chairs available in the morning. The beach was about 5-10 minutes away but it made for a nice walk and there was always a shuttle if need be. Nice beach, tons of places to sit and shade if you wanted it. We liked having the option to use the facilities and restaurants at the other Riu's and took advantage of that when we were at the beach. Hotel is well situated, and only a 7$ taxi ride to Playa del Carmen which we did. Didn't do any excursions so can't comment on that. Overall, a super stay. You can tell they work hard at maintaining Riu standards of quality. Staff was nothing but friendly and hard working, and made our stay that much better. Only complaint would be the nightly shows which did not match the quality of the resort. Better evening entertainment, singers or traditional dancers for example, no more Can-Can please!, would make this resort even more attractive. We flew with Sunwing, had good service overall and I would use them again.

There was always something for everyone and a regular 'Mexican' corner. The waiting staff were always very attentive. There were three a la carte restaurants which although free had to be pre-booked. The steakhouse was fantastic with a good sized sirloin and good wine. I was a little disappointed with the Mexican restaurant, and the Oriental menu didn't take our fancy so we didn't eat there. The hotel is about 250yds to the beach, with a gorgeous white beach and blue Carribean sea. Neither of us are particularly beach people, but we happily spent two days on this beach it was amazing. What I liked about the Riu complex most is that by being a guest at one hotel you can use the facilities at all the others on the complex.

We participated in a few of the pool activites, a few on the beach, and enjoyed the evening show. They really put a lot of time and effort in to their shows. Some shows were a bit cheesy but we still enjoyed everyone. Our wait staff at every meal was great. Ceaser in the main buffet made every meal so fun. He is such a little cutie. The last night he was so sad to see us leaving, he gave all the women in our group a kiss on the cheek. He is just so sweet. Bar staff in the pool area was just so much fun.

As mentioned this hotel is the nicest of the group. yes you have to walk to the beach but its not far and you can use the bars and eat lunch in the playacar and yucatan, we used both and it was a nice change of scenery. The tequlla had the best nightlfe,even guests from the posher palace came over and said thier,s was boring.The entertainment was good,the shows are good especially the ones where outside professionals come in, there is a disco, and there is a sportsbar open 24 hours if you want adrink or something to eat.The central bar in front of the stage is the hub of evening fun, the bar staff are so funny,you can get wonderful cocktails and whatever you want ,they will fix for you,long , short,hot or cold,they are so friendly and really make your holiday. The reception staff are wonderful too.I asked about a catholic church,they looked it up and wrote down times and instructions for me to show the taxi driver and even called a cab,lovely people. The hotel is so near everything,afew minutes from the beach, near to shops, and a short distance into player del carmen for souvenirs etc. W e walked there twice,about twenty minutes,there are some ruins to look at on the way and you can get a cab back if you are tired. For day trips go out of the hotel where the booths sell them at half the price of the reps.We went on a combined tulum and coba one and on another to chichen itza, both brilliant, tiring but unforgetable. The food is ok,you can usually find something you like, and there are the specialities to book for a change.we got in by booking before nine but they were worth it. A word of warning ,the temperature drops in the evening and can be quite chilly , so take a warm jacket and you ,ll enjoy it more. Unlike other countries no one pushes for a tip,,the workers are all so genuinely friendly and work so hard,,but remember,this is a really poor country and they work so hard and are so grateful, just tip when you feel you should and only as much as you can genuilly afford, leave your unused toiletries for the maids.they really do deserve something So have a great ti me.", "Date": "February 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Redmond, WA", "Title": "\u201cGood deal!\u201d", "Author": "BiaRedmond_WA", "ReviewID": "UR124921245", "Content": "I traveled with friends.

We have nothing to add to those numerous positive reviews about folks who work at Riu Tequila - really, great service, delicious food and wonderful people around you. Now some bad news for all those who would like to enjoy the sea. After the little storm the water in the sea became so dirty that one could not enter it without getting couple strong drinks first. It was disgusting to see pieces of plastic, paper and other filthy rubbish floating in front of your face while you were swimming. I want to mention that Riu Tequila is not located on the beach, so most probably their staff is not directly responsible for cleaning the sea. But other Riu hotels (Yucatan and Payacar) are definitely there, and their staff did NOTHING to clean the beach waters. I can understand that sea weeds are part of the sea, but how about rubbish.? It would take 5-7 staff members and 15 minutes of their time to get out there with nets and clean the swimming area...nothing like that happened, folks had to swim surrounded by crap. Not a nice view. This is not specifically Riu problem - waters along the beach in the whole Playa Del Carmen area were filthy. I strongly believe some managers of those hotels will read this review and do something to improve the situation.

I have to start off by saying...but I just was never surprised, I never had any moments of \"Wow! This is different!\" I never found anything that took my breath away, that was unique, that set this property apart from others. I have stayed at quite a few all-inclusives in the Caribbean, and this was the most plain and non-spectacular place of all. I love the Riu name and have stayed at a Riu property in the past. Am never let down, but this time just didn't feel amazed or impressed about a thing. The food was fine, the drinks were fine, the staff was fine, but nothing was GREAT. Could we get champagne? No. Popcorn? No. Lobster? No. To me, those are the fun and extra things I like to indulge on on vacation. But was there some type of seafood at every meal? Yes. I was never hungry, and I always saw a variety. We always bring our own thermal giant mugs which fit probably more than double the size of the drink you would receive from the staff, so I really recommend this. The beach is nice, very long and nice waves to jump in all the time. We tried snorkeling in front of the property, but there was absolutely nothing to see. The dive staff is very disappointing and cannot compete with others along the beach. We went thru Barrakuda which is a part of the Occidental Hideaway, 1 of the resorts near the Riu, and they had the best prices and dive trips. We were not able to do the night or shark dives we signed up for as they had the harbor closed for part of our trip due to the weather. Our room was fine, not amazing but clean, and actually not a rock-hard bed for once, which was nice. It was a bit of a walk to the beach, and I would prefer to stay at a property where you don't have to cross a road to get to the beach, but my travel agent had said it was \"at the back of the property\", which is not the Riu's fault. My boyfriend was pretty grossed out by all the coati's that was saw; at one time I counted 31 in one area! Kind of gross; they don't bother people but just nose around in garbage and look for scraps. There was one spot on the property near the beach that had signs about monkeys, and we did see one in a tree, which was cool. I never did see any iguanas, which I thought was weird. It was nice being able to walk to Playa and 5th avenue, and we took pix of the Mayan ruins we saw off the beaten path on the way there. For beach entertainment, we walked down to the Iberostar, which always had games and activities underway.

There were plenty of activities to choose from (i.e. ping pong, volleyball, gym, tennis, windsurfing, kayaking, body board, snorkelling, an introductory scuba diving lesson in the pool, etc.). The entertainment team were not pushy - if you wanted to participate you could and if you didn't they would leave you alone. You also had access to Riu Yucatan and Riu Playacar beaches, bars and a selection of restaurants, which gave you much freedom and many choices. THE ROOMS were spacious and clean. There was a well stocked mini-bar and liquor dispenser in each room, which were restocked every other day. There was also a safe that was free of charge which was really convenient. There was an iron and ironing board in the closet and a big umbrella if need be. Tip: If you don't like shampoo in packets, bring your own bottles. THE FOOD was very good - great variety! Every morning we would have a full breakfast buffet and on the spot cooking stations at the Riu Tequila ''Jalisco'' main restaurant and would go back every evening for dinner and never got bored. For lunch, we could go to the ''La Lupita\" poolside restaurant and swim-up bar or to the Riu Yucatan ''Beach Club'' snack bar/restaurant located on the beach or at the Riu Playacar ''Turquesa'' restaurant. THE BEACH was really nice, clean and not far from the resort. It was a 5-10 minute walk to get to the beach which was really pleasant (and appreciated after a big breakfast). If walking is a concern, a shuttle can take you to the Riu Yucatan beach. Easy breezy! 5TH AVENUE was about a 20-30 minute walk from the hotel. We chose to walk on the beach which was very pleasant. Once there, it was a busy street lined with all kinds of shops, art and crafts galleries, cafes, restaurants and bars. THE PLAZA PLAYACAR (a Mexican-Colonial styled shopping mall) and a STARBUCKS were located in front of the Riu Playacar Resort. When you exited the Riu Tequila Resort, you just needed to walk to your left for about two minutes. THE EVENING ATMOSPHERE was great! Every night after eating at the ''Jalisco'' restaurant we would go to the \"Maguey\" lounge bar with terrace or the \"El Kiosko\" pavilion bar to watch the show or just have a few drinks and chat. THE SPORTS BAR was open 24 hours. There were pool tables, air hockey tables, a foosball table, arcade games, Internet access and TV's. The fridge with sandwiches, hotdogs, and fruit was also much appreciated. LA PI\u00f1ATA NIGHT CLUB, next to the SPORTS BAR, was open from 11:30PM till 3AM.

The steakhouse and Asian restaurants were really good. The Mexican restaurant was at the Riu Yucatan, which was not nearly as good, and I LOVE Mexican food. The pool area was kept clean and so was the pool. I did find the coatis quite annoying, not cute. Was quite disappointed to see people actually feeding them, which makes the problem worse. Also the black bids (grackles?) can be quite annoying too, especially flying around in the Lupita restaurant. The birds and the coatis would be the only real negatives about the place. Riu Tequila is not right on the beach, but there is transportation that goes back and forth if you want to ride, or a 10 minute walk. We found the beach quite full, and also the pool at the Riu Yucatan to be quite full. We were quite happy to go back to the quiet pool at Riu Tequila. We can hardly wait to go back!!

We were not disappointed. It is just as beautiful and friendly now as before. The rooms are kept very clean with little extras like funny animal towels on the bed. The food was very good with lots of choice at the buffet. I just have a couple of negatives to comment on. The first was the flight delay. We were at the airport at 8 AM for our 10:45 flight. After waiting in a very long line, we found that our flight had been changed to 2:05 PM (a 6 hr wait at the airport). It's a 4 hr flight from Toronto and then we sat in the transfer van for appox. 1/2 hr before we were finally on our way to the resort. It's almost an hour ride from the airport. There was another 4 hr delay on the return. I am not sure if we will use Sunwing again! One other comment would be about the lack of knowledge by the staff about 'gluten free'. My husband has a severe reaction to anything with wheat, barley, oats or rye. When we asked if any of the dishes were made with wheat flour (he carried a note with this in spanish) they had no idea.

The hotel grounds are also gorgeous, esp when the sun shone. Woke up to the birds singing. Food pretty good, we think GBP was better, with more selection but the breakfasts were excellent. Only ate at the Bamboo Asian a la carte and very disappointed, just another buffet, although less people. Someone here reccommended eating outside and it was a good tip, although late at night, the coatis can get very forward! The pool was beautiful and clean. The beach also fantastic and a very easy walk. I treated myself to a hot stone massage at the Renova spa at Riu Yucatan and it was fantastic, very relaxing and again the spa was very clean. The only problem with the rooms was that the doors are very heavy and difficult to close quietly and there guests with very little respect for other people who would slam them very early in the morning. This was dealt with efficiently by the management. Sunwing as a tour operator has very little respect for your time, don't be surprized if you are delayed!

This was likely because the resort is not situated right on the beach. You must walk 3-5 minutes or take the golf cart to get to the beach or sister RIU resorts. We enjoyed the option of going to a more \"party resort\" for part of the day knowing we could return to ours to relax. The cart ride was a fun activity too... we liked the plaza that was down the street that had some nice shops and that too was only a few minute walk. The resort is in Playacar which is a gated resort community. You felt very safe and still able to walk along the street to check out the other resorts or go shop.

We got a reasonable deal - booked end of November (\u00a31100 each). We arrived on the 2nd and found the welcome at reception very nice but being that it is quite a large hotel most people would need a hand to find their room. We had stayed here before (in 2005) so had an idea where we were going - but still got lost. The flight with Thomson was on time (both inbound and outbound), but service was not great and overall was disappointed with the extras you need to pay for with them - not even a soft drink included and food was pretty rubbish. Couldn't believe you have to pay to upgrade your tv - just so you can pause or rewind!!! Choice of movies without upgrade was virtually non-existent. Virgin begin flying to Cancun this summer and will definately not travel with Thomson again if we can avoid it. Reps in resort were very polite and friendly but knowledge not great. Anyway, this is not a Thomson review, so I will get on with it..... The hotel was very busy our first week (with those having been for New Year) and was much quieter during the second week. Rooms: Very nice - newly decorated - very clean - everything you would need. Very noisy in the morning (between 6.30 and 9) with other guests in the corridoor which is very echoey, so not very relaxing if you like a bit of a lie in on holiday. Food: Pretty good, lots of choice, gets a little tedious after 2 weeks, so began alternating - one night eating out in town, the next in the hotel. Totally maddening way of booking the a la carte restaurants - from 7.00am you can book either chinese/steak/mexican. By 9am (when we generally got to breakfast) everything was booked up.....don't think 9am for brek on hols is that late! Anyway, one morning I was woken at about 6.30am by kids shouting in the corridoor, so thought I would get up and see if I could book the chinese for that night. Got to the main lobby at 6.45 (soon to be joined by loads of other people). I managed to book a table in the chinese for that evening. Felt really weird waiting in line to book - like we were a bit desperate or something - not very nice at all. Then that evening we weren't very impressed with the restaurant anyway - food very greasy - main buffet was much better. Can't speak for the other 2 restaurants, but I wouldn't bother again. Pool: Didn't spend much time in the pool area as we prefer the beach - but generally not impressed - the agoutis (local animals) are a pain, and generally the cleanliness in the pool buffet was not good. Has definately gone downhill since our last visit. Pool area was MUCH nicer at the Playacar. Beach: Headed down to the Yucatan beach area on our first day (about 10 min walk which was fine), arrived about 10am but beach was very crowded - no sun loungers - had to put our towels down on the sand which wasn't ideal. The next day we walked along the road to the Riu Playacar - this bit of beach was much quieter and we also preferred the luch here - nice and clean restaurant. As I understand it, the Playacar is due a refurb, so once rooms are redone I would probably consider staying here instead of the Tequila if returning. The Tequila was pretty lively at night but we went into town most evenings - think lots of people go to the Tequila - normal nightly entertainment shows - not our cup of tea but looked good enough. General: Didn't feel obliged to tip - but we did tip when we felt it appropriate. Staff were all very helpful and friendly, excellent bar service - they are soooo busy, but very attentive and never waited long to be served. Porter service spot on and very quick. Reception called once a week to check that our room was ok. Got a couple of bites but no real problem with mossies. NIce big bathroom, but a very dark shower! Good powerful hairdryer, but no socket anywhere in the room near a mirror for straightners. For those that are interested the weather in Jan was not humid enough to cause a problem with frizzy hair. I remember before in November, struggling with frizz! Weather was great - one day of rain, and a little cool on a couple of evenings. Quite windy, but was nice to have a breeze on the days it wasn't so cloudy. Didn't use the hotel for any trips etc... went to Cozumel (snorkeling) and Cancun under our own steam, and used Thomson for a day trip to Coba/Mayan Village/Cenote. Coba was good but not as amazing as Chichen Itza (but you can still climb Coba). Cenote was great - really enjoyed it. All in all - a very nice holiday - definately not 4/5 star but nice.

Have previously stayed at the Riu Yucatan but much prefer the Rui Tequila - despite the short walk to the beach - it is literally a 10 min stroll down a private tree lined and shaded walk way - transport is available throughout the day for those who dont feel up to the walk. Agree that there are no doubt are more palatial 5* hotels - but - for the price feel that the Rui Tequila will be hard to beat. The staff are pleasant/courteous and work tirelessly to ensure that service is top notch. There is a wide variety of good quality food in the main dining area - catering for all tastes - the head chef makes himself known to guests and assures that if there are any special requests for particular dishes to let him know and he will try and accommodate. There are a plentiful number of bars both in the Yucatan (servicing the beach areas) and the Tequila - beer and wine OK and a wide variety of cocktails available - as expected these were generally made using local spirits - the waiters quite happy to top up the alcohol content if requested - very impressed that International brands are available if specifically requested ie Barcardi, Smirnoff, Jonny Walker, Gordans etc. Beach is beautiful - white sand, palm trees, blue sea - again all meticulously maintained. We did not take any of the organised tours but occasionally strolled into Playa Del Carmen (about a 30 min walk or 70 pesos in a taxi) nice to wander down 5th Avenue - would also recommend taking a taxi to Akulmal Beach (350 pesos - 25 min journey) - another lovely bay/beach with the attraction of being able to hire snorkelling equipment (including floatation jackets) and see giant sea turtles - amazing!!

I happened to get a pretty good deal for this trip, all in $1800 for two people from Toronto. I've paid almost double that to go to a self-proclaimed '5' star but to be honest the experience there was no better there. I won\u2019t get into the minutiae as many people's reviews do a good job of that. In essence, what the Tequila lacks in grandeur and poshness it makes up for in really attentive service, friendly wildlife, and fairly decent food and drinks. Here's where I'll get more detailed; for me, food is a big factor to where I stay and I always found something to eat and drink and never saw a shortage of food. The buffet is good, the steakhouse is enjoyable, and the Asian restaurant impressed me. We never went to the Mexican restaurant because ironically it received the worst reviews from people there..which I don't quite get, but they had Mexican options at the buffet so no big loss. All in, nothing is truly mind-blowingly amazing, but it\u2019s all done properly and with an attention to detail and selection. Oh, and the guacamole is awesome, the wine is crap and the hot sauce is HOT. Tums and Pepto are your friends. I think for me what made it a more unique experience were the animals, the coatis are my new favourite animal and made me miss my doggies a little less. As well, the fun and eclectic bunch of visitors from all over made if truly feel like we were away not just hanging out with other Canadians on a beach talking about hockey (boooooring) and drinking Molson Canadian. We met great people of all age groups from UK, Austria, Spain, US, Germany..Etc. While some are more boisterous than others such as the Brits, overall people seemed friendly and happy about their vacation choice. Additionally the staff all seemed super pleasant and appeared to really love their jobs. This definitely adds to your experience. We spent most of our days down at the beach, or hanging at the Playacar pool bar. The people watching is fun and I really enjoyed the variance in bathing suit styles, ha-ha. We never once used the Tequila pool, so no comments on that. As for Playa Del Carmen, I really enjoyed it, always felt safe and thought the locals were super nice, kinda pushy if you walk through the main souvenir alley, but always accepting of a quick 'no thanks'. Also, the road to the town is pretty and interesting if you're into architecture, there are some very impressive homes. All in all, we'll most likely return to the area given the price point, short plain-ride and relaxed vibe but probably will check out another resort just because there are so many options and it's good to change things up.

Definately good for some serious relaxing :) We have been travelling a lot but this was our frist time in all inclusive and it met all the expectations. Food was good and we specially enjoyed the dessert selection! Pool towels were provided. Hotel is a 5min walk from the beach where the sunloungers drinks etc. are provided. You can use the beachfront swimming pool of Riu Yucatan (also a nice hotel but we prefer Tequila as it has slightly better atmosphere). There was an evening show every day 21.30pm. I found the main bar area a pleasant place to have a drink in the evening. Good place to make new friends and had an international atmosphere in it. Our holiday was near to perfection and I honestly found only few minor cons in the Riu Tequila staff: Not enought shampoo was provided and had to ask for it (was pretty soon delivered). Many tv's seemed to be broken so be prepared to ask them to fix it. I had to ask 3 times before they fixed it after 4 days (well who goes there to watch tv anyways). Playing tennis is free, but you have to go to the opposite hotel Riu Yucatan because there is no longer courts in tequila (I'm a tennis lover and would still stay again in tequila, just wanted to point out that information given in most of the sites is false and they don't have an own court). Also the court condition is not the best possible so this is something they could also make better in the resourts. For some reason there was a guy working in Riu Yucatan desk who gave us some bad attitude when reserving the courts from there. Playa del Carmen is a very touristy place so if you don't mind that sort of thing this is your place. I prefer slightly more authentic towns, but I was there for the beach (which is amazing). We made few trips by ourselves because trips provided by thomson were so expensive. I suggest making your own trip to Isla Muheres (our favorite spot on this holiday!) - take a bus to cancun, then a local bus to the ferry. In Isla Muheres remember to rent a golf cart to drive around the small islands, thats a must! We also went to Cozumel and Tulum which were cool and easy+cheap to go by yourself. Instead of Chichen itza we went to Coba which is similiar and much closer so you don't have to spend a day in a car. Coba was great and by what I've only heard it might actually be better than Chichen itza. And when in Coba remember to get a guide from the porch (cost us 100 pesos / person).

The hotel was lovely and the gardens, pools etc very nice. On arrival we were taken care of quickly and were happy to get to our room as the experience at the airport was not the best!! very busy, long queues... The food at the hotel was always very nice and varied and my two young children enjoyed the pizza and usual kids type foods. My eldest even tried some of the seafood dishes and liked them too!! Plenty of ice cream and nice deserts.Lunch was also very good lots of chice. Popcorn machine and nachos etc available as snacks to take back to your sun longers round the pool. The themed nights were good, especially the games/carnival night with games in reception and candy floss!! nice touch! Drinks were good, lots of choice again. The beach was AMAZING, absoloutely gorgeous! Plenty of sunbeds and all incusive at the other bars and restaurants for food and drink. To get there, It was a ten minute walk through the pathway with nice shade or you could catch the little buggy which was fun, but we walked most of the time. The areas around the hotel were very safe and well kept. We walked to 5th avenue twice whilst there and this was nice as someting different to staying at the hotel all day. It did rain a few times whilst we were there with one day overcast (still very warm) but as we were there 14 days, it didnt spoil the weather overall, which was lovely and sunny and HOT! If you turned left out of the hotel and walked a few minutes down the road, there were a few shops and stalls which were handy and good for a little stroll in the morning. The evening entertainment was good some nights better than others and the kids loved the mini disco! They put on 2 or 3 shows whilst we were there and my daughter took part (Lion King and Grease) she loved that!! So did we..during the day kids club ran am and pm sessions, these were good. Free wifi in reception was good for a quick catch up on things at home. The staff were all great and especially some of the waiters who were excellent entertaining our 2 year old at meal times, so friendly and genuine. Would definately come back here again, however may try other countries first. Have been to Antigua and Dominican, enjoyed both but Mexico the best so far!

They cooked it infront of you whch i thought was really good. The staff were so good from recption, to resteraunt, to cleaners and especially the entertainers who we became really friendly with.

We had an awesome time as we really love Playa Del Carmen- the vibe, the shopping, the restaurants, the nightlife and the beaches all make this place amazing. The Riu Tequila was ok, not too bad but I did expect more from the really high recommendations from trip advisor. Here are the main pros/cons in my opinion: Pros -got a good price. We paid $1000 +tax each from Vancouver, Canada. All the other resorts that were 5 stars were almost a grand more per person and because we didnt want to spend too much this time. The price was fair for the resort quality, I would not pay more than what we did however -very clean grounds, and all eating areas and bathrooms also kept spotless -Super cute animals called Coatis around the resort. They look like a racoon and anteater mixed. We loved seeing them! They leave you alone but if you wanted to see them like we did, then bring out some food and they came running! They do not bite! But they do come in large numbers so if your scared of animals, dont try this Cons -I called the resort a week before we arrived to request 1 large king size bed. I had seen pictures of 2 double beds pushed together but other pictures of 1 large bed. So i requested 1 bed for me and my husband (it was our anniversary so this was super important to me) and the lady on the phone says \"no problem\". After we checked in and arrive in our room, I am pissed off to see 2 double beds pushed together! So I call the front desk and they tell me that ALL the normal rooms have 2 beds like this. The only rooms with 1 bed are the more expensive suites and of course they didnt have any available so we were stuck with it. So if you want to cuddle, it requires work as you both have a bed with separte blankets. Annoying b/c she told me on the phone that I would get 1 bed. I was not happy with this!!! -This is not a True 5 star resort so travel sites that say it is, are not being honest. We got married at the Dreams Cancun and stayed at the Royal Cancun as well- these are 5 star resorts. The Riu Tequila is not! But it is a 4 star so you should hopefully know that before you book it with really high expectations. The bed is firm, not soft, the sheets are stiff, the towels are old and not soft, the food is OK...again, not bad but not great either. After this experience, we both decided we would pay a bit more to book a real 5 star -your fridge only gets filled every other day. Doesnt sound like a big deal but we came back late from Playa one night and I really needed water after all the drinking and the front desk has NO water and we were told we would have to wait until the NEXT day at 9 am for water!!!! Come on- you need water to be available 24/7 in a resort!!! I was feeling sick and needed it but apparently only the maids can get you some the next day. Stupid. So the next time we went out at night, we brought our own water back from OXXO. -15 minute walk to the beach and NO drink service at the beach, have to wait up the steps to the pool area and then walk back to the beach every time Overall, we had a great trip! The Tequila was ok, did the job. But I would book something nicer with better beds/linens/restaurants/beach service just cos we know its nicer!

They travel in very large packs and were all over the place, most likely due to the idiots that thought it was fun to feed them. They have become TOO comfortable with people.

On arrival, after a 11.5 hour flight we were checked in very quickly. Our room (903) was lovely and had everything you could possibly need or want for a two week holiday. The mini-bar was topped up every two days and was never empty, the room was cleaned every single day and there was a towel display left for us every day also. The actual hotel is quite large but doesnt feel it due to the walkways. The food was amazing. Having only been all inclusive once before where the food was awful I was slightly apprehensive but could not have been happier with the food. there was everything you would ever want, massive salad bars with various salads, cold meats, salad dressings etc. There was the usual mexican cuisine available every night, fajitas, tacos, flautas etc and things like rice, chips, burgers (excellent homemade), hot dogs, steaks, potatoes etc also every night. Then there would be something different at the 'carving' station, one night it would be salmon, beef wellington, glazed chickens or peking duck. Then there was loads of other dishes that varied every night and they had theme nights also, like chinese, caribbean, bbq etc. Honestly, the food was plentiful and of very good quality. There was also the a la carte's that you book in the morning just outside the buffet restaurant. We tried the steak house, which is the pool bar, and it was lovely. Best sirloin I have had in a while. We also tried the asian, which I wasnt too impressed with but my husband liked. Didnt get round to trying the mexican at the beach bar so cant comment. Then there was the bars. The pool bar doubled as the lunchtime buffet, which was our favourite meal sometimes. Everything at the pool bar was served in plastic glasses for obvious reasons. Then there was the bar nearest the lobby, kiosk I think it was called, which seemed to get really busy at night time. Our favourite bar was miguel, which means cactus, where the main bartender veronica was lovely and got to know your order after 1 night. The local beer was really nice and the cocktails lovely. I tried quite a few and would recommend a strawberry daquiri or a margarita. And try a scooby doo or a tequilla slammer for a nice shot. You could sit at the bar and watch the shows every night, which were really good. They did the usual kids thing first, which was actually quite funny then it would be the main show. The staff definetly make this hotel what it is, they work so hard and are always smiling and happy. And they work all day and night. They start in the morning at the pool or the beach with all the games, which are numerous and go on all day, then they are still working at night doing the shows. Amazing. We had a grease show, a horrow show, a traditional mayan show, a vegas show and loads more. There was also the sports bar which was open 24 hours for drinks and snacks, sandwiches, burgers and hot dogs. And the disco which was open from about 11.30-2am. The beach is a 5 minute walk at most and is worth it. Water is crystal clear and so warm, Does get really busy though so make sure and get down early and get a good bed. While at the beach there is the beach bar you can use which does buffet lunch or you can use the riu yucatan, which is on your right as you walk down to the beach. you can also use their pool, which we did sometimes as was better for getting the sun all day. Thats maybe the only problem with the tequilla, the pool area is really shaded with palms so its hard to get a bed in the sun. People had obviously figured out the best spots and were reserving these all the time from very early in the morning, something you were not meant to do as theres signs everywhere but everyone does it anyway. outside of the hotel about a few minutes walk is playacar with some shops and stalls. Be warned that they give you the price of everything in dollars, even though the government has said dollars are not to be accepted as legal currency in mexico, and when you ask for the price in pesos they seemed to just pick a figure from nowhere. You do have to haggle because everything is overpriced. We got 5 fridge magnets and were initially priced 400 mexican pesos, about \u00a320. I just laughed at the guy and eventually got it down to about 150 pesos, about \u00a37.50 roughly, much more reasonable for fridge magnets! We didnt want to take advantage and underpay them because you can see the workmanship that has gone into these hand crafted objects like the ceramic dishes which are gorgeous, but dont be ripped off either. I think they are too used to americans and canadians who seemed to flash the cash a bit too much, no offence. we also went to xcaret, which was one of the best days ever. Its hard to describe because there's nothing like it here but its like a big ecological park with ruins, dolphins and lots of other animals, beaches and live shows. That might not sound very good but its an amazing place and if you go stay for the show at night, starts about 6pm in the theatre and was the most amazing thing we ever saw. We also went to chichen itza, well you're not going to go all the way to mexico and not go. Its a long day, about 3 hours drive away, but worth it to see one of the 7 wonders of the world. Don't do this trip with thomson's, go with one of the wee stalls in playacar and get it cheaper and with better guides who seem to know everything there is to know about the area.

Here is my honest opinion of this resort: Shuttle from airport - Approximately 40 minutes from the airport in a comfortable and airconditioned coach bus. Check in - Very fast. Front desk was very helpful, we asked for a 2nd room key since we had 3 girls, one key would just not work for us. Bellboy took all our suitcases to our room, we stayed in 3316, far enough from the pool, and we had a view of the service entrance of Riu Lupita (we didnt care since we werent planning on staying in our room much). Rooms: Clean, but dated and small. Shower was good with decent water pressure and lots of room. Had a separate toilet room with no fan. Mini bar was in the washroom. More than enough closet space and drawers for 3 girls and our many belongings. Stay on the 2nd floor, a tip i took off trip advisor, many people on the 1st complained of animals on their balcony. The beds are as hard as a rock. Not a comfortable sleep, but after a long day in the sun and some liquor, you should be able to pass out. Food - The buffet was fantastic, best variety I've seen at a resort so far. It was soo good we didnt even do the a la cartes, so I can't give any advice on those. They had theme nights for dinner, our favorite was the mexican theme night. They had sushi every night in the buffet, but it had cream cheese in it (ewwww). The servers are all supergreat, we tipped well for everything, and we always had good service. Breakfast and Dinner are both in the main buffet, lunch is in the outdoor buffet by the pool. And yes, cats, birds and raccoons alll wander in. Pools/Loungers - we hung around the activity pool, even though the swim up bar was at the opposite pool. We never had an issue getting a lounge chair around 10am. Somtimes it wasnt in the place we wanted it, so we dragged chairs around. People who complain they cant get a chair probably crawled out of bed around 1pm. Pools look clean, but I did see a little kid pee right in the pool. When there are kids, there is pee, no matter how clean it looks it probably isnt. Entertainment - There is always something to do at the resort, activities around the pool in the day, and shows in the theatre at night. We spoke with a bunch of the entertainment staff, who all speak excellent english, and they work so unbelievably hard, and such long hours. Some of them were awesome (Mike, Daniel, Alby), but some of the others were just so inappropriate (you'll find out very fast who to avoid). Beach - never went myself, but my travel companions did, and they said it was perfection, soft sand, blue water, and lots of waves. Beach was not rocky. People at the resort: It was good mix of young, old and everything else in between. It was not predominantly Canadian, American or British, tons of French, Russian, Italian, Polish guests there as well. Eveyrone seemed very friendly. Disco - It was pretty happening! people of all ages there, and great music and drinks. Pet peeves of the entire trip: (1) Those bloody raccoons. I hated them. There were swarms of them everywhere, particularly at night. If you had food, the were agressive, they are not cats, do not pick them up and try to cuddle them. (2)A La Carte Reservations- who on earth wants to wake up at 7am for a reservation??? I would recommend this hotel if you are ok with the raccoons, but that would be the only reason I would be hesitant to return. PS - Avoid Sunwing if you can. PM me for details.

We usually visit mexico in December and stay for the christmas eve gala meal that had always been great but due to work commitments we went after new year. We thought this wouldnt make a difference to the food or drink quality especially after paying just over \u00a31200 each. We were sadly wrong and had this confirmed by the bar staff when we ordered wine, at the beginning of the holiday my mum was served a sparkling white that she enjoyed and my sister enjoyed a nice rose and about 5 days into our holiday both wines had changed and were not so nice, the bar staff informed us that they no longer had that wine in untill next christmas as they only have it in at christmas. The same went for the dinning room first at breakfast we were served Hash browns and bacon then we had mexican food, i know im in mexico but i cant eat tacos at breakfast, breakfast on my previous visits was my favourite meal however the past few weeks ive been living on bread or just avoiding eating altogether. We were there for two weeks and in the first week we enjoyed bbq's outside in the evening, steak, pork and different theme nights then the second week had 4 mexican nights, thats ok were in mexico however not everyone can eat chilie tacos fajitas everynight and enjoy it, so again a bread roll was a good option. We tried all the a la cartes which were always booked up but when you went in they were always empty which did confuse us, they were all nice the Steak house being the family favourite even though on past visits this was our least favourite and asian was good and we would agree that the mexican was only ok. Lunch was huge disapointment, much of the food at the beach ran out quickly and the chefs couldnt replace it quick enough but pizza pasta bugers and chips with salad and fruit was the day to day routine. Sometime the food here was undercooked. The luch at the tequila was better, alot more to choose from. The Riu Playa Car was better for lunch too. (The plastic drinking cups were also alot bigger at the playa car) Food in a nut shell is that it was ok a little tastless, great if you love mexican food burgers and chips and not so great if you need your vegtables unless you like them served in cream. The Lunch is best at the tequila pool or at the playa car. I will finish talking about the food by saying that everyone in the party had a bad stomach for our entire stay, and it was not due to alchole as i do not drink, on the plus side no one else has said this in there reviews so it must of just been us....odd...... Which reminds me where possible make sure you use the drinks in your fridge down the the beach and by the pool as the machines were flat and odd tasting. Now for the service, i will start by saying our first choice/thomson rep was great he always spoke everyday was helful and was always happy. A person on our holiday that i think deserves a mention is Rangel our waiter in the main buffet he was great, he made our dinning experience, we often only went in the buffet in the evening to break the night up and not to eat as we didnt enjoy the food, and we were garenteed a good night as rangel took the time to speak to us about his country and have a laugh, he spoke great english and made sure that all his guests were happy. Great service. The reception were always firendly eventhough they failed to deliever toilet roll one day. The maids worked hard, our room was well kept and clean every day only fault we had that was not her fault as she had so many rooms to do was that on several days we went back to the room for showers at 3pm and she had not been to room yet and we had no towells so we often had to go back out and wait untill she had got round to our room. veronica at the bar at the theatre was also excellent at her job. The hotel looks very nice, the reception is large and clean and has that wow factor compared to the other Rius, The rooms have had a great makover and the showers were great. The cracks within the hotel are with the food and my stomach still is not 100% but im not sure to what could have caused this as later in the holiday i lived of bread rolls. The pool was always clean however finding a spot in the sun alday seemed impossible so great if you love shade from the sun. Dont let this worry you as no one else has mentioned stomach problems even though all six of us suffered. My other piece of advice is you need mix currency and it seemed best to exchange in mexico in Playa as the had great exchange rates. They seem to be clever at getting you to pay in one currency and giving you change in another currency in the shops at there own exchange rate which often meant you were paying alot more so be carful. I have tried to write a honest fair review of our experience, yours maybe different anyway have a great holiday.", "Date": "January 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cFantastic hotel, would definatly recommend.\u201d", "Author": "Emmalina123", "ReviewID": "UR123375158", "Content": "Stayed at this hotel in dec 2011. After the 11 hour flight we were greeted at the hotel by the friendly staff with a cold alcohol free cocktail. The bellboys were ready to take our cases to our room so we could have a look around the hotel. The hotel reception is all open plan, very spacious with free wifi. After our short walk through the grounds we arrived at our room. Very spacious again with 2double beds, a tv with lots of english speaking chanels, a separate toilet and shower and a free mini bar with optics that Is stocked every other day. The main restaurant has lots of choice with the chefs constantly cooking more. There was always something for everyone. Try the pasta stand where you can pick your pasta, sauce, meat and extras for your perfect fresh pasta cooked in front of you. Same with the omelette stand. There was always a theme and never the same food 2 days in a row. If you have a sweet tooth try the pancakes with maple syrup at breakfast!! Very tasty. Breakfast has a variety aswel. Cereal, toast, full English, waffles, eggs - poached, boiled, fried and scrambled and lots more. The pool restaurant is the place for diner offering burgers, pizza, chips, pasta, sandwiches, salads, soup, plus lots of different hot meals. At night the pool restaurant turns into a steak house and this is the place where you want to go more than once. Be prepared to get up early to book though as it gets booked up by around 8.30am. Worth the early get up tho. It is the only restaurant that is not self serve. It is a 5 course meal of ceasar salad, a sharing platter, soup, a choice of 5 mains and tequila desert. There is also 2 more restaurants, one being the Asian and one the Mexican. In my oppinion the mexican is a waste of time, didn't enjoy it at all, mexican food is better back home. The Asian was ok but mostly cold food, only went to both of these restaurants once. Also the Mexican rest is at the riu yucatan hotel. Onto the pool, lovely big pool with a big swim up bar, loved being able to sip cocktails sat in the pool. Tip: get at the pool early to get a sunbed in the sun as there is a no reserving sunbed rule but people still put their towels on them and only get by the pool mid day! The pool is more lively at the yucatan with music and games etc. also the yucatan is right on the beach so for the beach days you can get your drinks and lunch from the yucatan pool bar an restaurant. Also there is free Basic watersports for riu guests. The third riu hotel is the riu , this is the smallest of the three and the quietest so we only visited it once. the entertainment at the tequila is fab. Different shows on every night. The casino night is one to go to. You get free chips and play for fun and the person with the most chips at the end play for fun. The cocktails are very nice, we went through the whole menu!! If your into your shots ask for a Mexican flag!! You won't be disappointed. A good tip that we picked up was if your wanting to go for a day trip to cancun catch the bus from the bus station at the top of 5 th avenue and once at cancun get a taxi to the riu cancun. You can use this hotel and eat and drink there with your wristband. The riu cancun is right in the centre of all the hustle and bustle of cancun. We also walked down to the big shopping centre which was about an hour walk so of your not into walking get in a taxi. They have hooters, Chicago rock, buba gump shrimp and se\u00f1or frogs there aswel as coco bongo and mandala. Its quite americanised in cancun, totally different in player del carmen. We also had a trip to cozamel. It was a bit of a rough rise and it's like a sceen from a horror movie on the ferry! Sick bags at the ready. Cozamel wasn't my cup of tea, just for hassled from the second we arrived to te second we left. Chichen itza is definatly worth visiting but I would catch the bus of I was to do it again rarer than go on a guided trip as you spend all morning Faffing about picking people up and visiting a pond and having lunch at what looks like a school canteen. Get the bus there and back it's cheaper and you can be there and back within half a day. Also try xcaret ecological park. It is expensive but worth it. You get a full day there including lunch at any restaurant with free unlimited soft drinks while you eat. Swim in the underground rivers it was definatly an experience. Also you get to watch the Mexican show at the end of the day, have your cameras ready. Hope this helps aid your decision to book the riu tequila, definatly a fantastic holiday!!

Bars were great, drinks were not watered. We loved the fact that it was in a gated community and thus, very safe. We went to other hotels to look around and were allowed to eat at other Riu's (except Palace, I think). There even was a Starbuck's with 10 minute walking distance from our hotel! Should mention, though, that its a 7 minute walk to the beach (if you want beach front, stay at Riu Palace or Riu Yucatan). Pools were very clean, too.

The Riu get it right. The food is excellent and the staff are extremely friendly and hardworking. One tip, don't follow the waiters when visiting the Buffet Restaurant, ask for a Terrace Table - much quieter and more enjoyable then the sometimes chaotic restaurant atmosphere. Unfortunately the waiters tend to show you to a table very close to other diners when they do not need to which is uncomfortable and more like eating in a cafe then a restaurant. However, you do not have to stay at that table - move if you wish - or ask for a table on the terrace. The show cooking is great and we very rarely queue for the actual buffet food. Or, eat from the Mexican section - no queue. Lunchtimes, the Tequila Lupita Restaurant offers the best choice rather than the beach buffets at the Yutacan. The Asian restaurant is also wonderful and no queuing. This year we did notice that there appeared to be many more young groups of people determined to get drunk quickly at the free bars. Unfortunate. Mostly families and couples and hopefully it will stay that way or we won't go back. The beds are not the most comfortable in the rooms and this year we noticed that they had placed a rubber protector on the mattress - very Butlins and not appreciated.

I expected this resort to be 5 star as I booked it with my travel agent who confirmed that this was a 5 star resort. I have been to MANY 5 star resorts before, and when I arrived, I immediately thought to myself: THIS IS NOT A 5-STAR RESORT! ENTRANCE: We checked in front desk (always ONE receptionist working at night; mind you I checked in at 1am- although I seem to find that alot of the guests checked in late) after delays with our flights, etc, I was shocked to see that this resort resembled of that of a 3.5 star resort. There were no security guards walking around the resort to make sure things were okay (as most 5 star resorts do), and the place just looked dead. Dark lights-nothing welcoming about it at all. LOBBY: My hotel room was about a 2-3 min walk from the lobby, and I found raccoon/monkey flying above me on trees and roaming the walkway like no one's business. I was so disguisted! I think this was perfect for families who wanted a mini-zoo at their resort- cause you had it all! cats, racoons, beaver/rat looking animals running around.... everywhere! ROOM: The room was decent- not 5 star as a mentioned. The walls looked plastured from clay. The room felt icky and the floor sticky from the cleaning stuff. I guess they dump a bunch of chemical on the floor when the maids clean it. So to sum it up, the room felt very eerie, but after a few sleepless nights, I finally slept comfortably.TV was okay, some english but mostly Spanish. FOOD: Overall, the food was OK. I would say 3/5 star. For all those people who said this is 5 star food, you must step out of your kitchen and try real 5 star quality food!!! The food is made simple, for example: scrambled eggs, eggs, poached eggs, bacon, sausages, toast, etc. Lunch: Stir fry, grilled vegetabes, hot dogs, burgers, pastas, mexican fajitas, soups, etc. Dinner, ribs, chicken, cheap steak, corn, etc.... you get the idea. There is NOTHING GOURMET ABOUT THE FOOD, its just EAT-ABLE-just like if you were going to any affordable restaurant in your city. You have to wake up early to book at the the other restaurants, but dont even waste your time-nothing magical about it-same type food, just culturally different. SWIMMING POOL- My room was located right beside the swimming pool. It is surrounded by trees and crazy animals that like to get drunk off your drinks and grow a belly eating your potato chips lol. It's not the greastest, but do-able if you dont want to walk to the beach or if your too lazy and need a tan. It is mostly filled with obese ladies. (please take no offense, I am speaking from what I witnessed). BEACH: The beach is about a 8-12 minute walk from the Lobby to the beach, It has a really nice beach- and you can eat at the Riu resort there as well. The swimming pool at the Riu at the beach is much better than at Riu Tequila, so if you want more sun then must go there! ENTERTAINMENT- The entertainment was well orchestrated. The performers work their butts off to make you happy and they party hard at night to keep the crowd going. Must give props to them, otherwise this resort would be DOOMED without them. They work 6 days a week, from early morning to 4:00pm doing recreational sports at the swimming pool, then have their break from 4-8pm, then back to work in the evening. It is amazing and I am sincerely inspired by them. You wont be disappointed. Every night at 9:30pm there is a show. At 8:30-930 there is a kids show for 2+ and up, I believe. The kids love it. SERVICE: The service was okay,. The servers work extremely hard and always try to put a smile on their faces. However, mind you, this resort DOES NOT HAVE 24HOUR ROOM SERVICE, meaning you cant order in food after 10pm!!!! :( So sad, especially when I have a child and she wants to eat after 10! The only food that they have after 10 is at the snackbar and it is filled with sandwiches and burgers and hotdogs- and it is so not good!! SPORTS BAR: The sports bar looks really sketchy- its just really run-down and you get the feeling of the dirty pub. KIDS KLUB- The kids klub's playground seemed really nice, but inside looks dirty and untidy. They need to update some of the desks and other necessities. The room is really small and it is located at the end of the swimming pool. I did use the babysitting service, which were the ladies at the front desk. They charge $10 dollar U.S/hour. It was great! OVERALL: To sum up, this resort is honestly a 3.5 to 4 star. It is a walk from the beach, there is NO room service, not much selections of food, swimming pool is small, and it is located mainly in the forest where the resort is situated on. This resort is PERFECT for families with children (because of the mini-zoo type deal), and people who are on a BUDGET. This is NOT a 5-star resort, let me say that again, NOT A 5 STAR RESORT. Great entertainment, and close to shops and playa del carmen main shopping centre (bonus). Would I go back to this resort again? NO. I would rather much stick to an actual 5-star resort and pay an extra 500-1000 dollars to do so. I even tried to upgrade my hotel to the RIU PALACE but they were all sold out. Of course at the RIU PALACE (located by the beach) it was also a 5 star but included 24 hr room service, and MANY other facilities/entertainment. So keep in mind, even though the hotel says they are 5-star, you need to really look at what other services they offer such as, do they have 24hr room service? how many restaurants they have? How modern the room look?

The good point of the hotel are its staff, animals in the grounds and food. There is no issue with it not being on the beach - it is only a 5minute easy walk or hitch a lift (if you can ever get on it) on the never ending golf cart taxi loop. Apart from the Las Vegas night and some of the lobby sounds (particularly good duo-the guy is elvis on the Las Vegas production) entertainment is poor and almost completely reliant on the animation team (excellent dancers). The resort centre is half an hour (safe at all times of day/night) level walk away (or \u00a33.50 taxi at all times) and we went there about half the time because of the poor hotel based 'entertainment'. It is annoying to have to book the sepciality restruarants before 0900 on the day you want them, but the truth is that the main buffet resturanat has fantastic choice of good quality food anyway. Drinks do feel if they are watered down, but so what? There is a Starbucks almost next door and some private shops. A bad thing is that there is hardly any sunny spots around the pool where you struggle to get a sun bed anyway - but you are in the carribean so go to the beach! Some days we also had problems in finding sunbeds on the beach but had to wait no more than 15minutes before sorting a couple. Finally, dont compare with Cancun - they are completely different and each give a different holiday - this area is sensitivity cut out of jungle, so is very green and full of animals you may not have seen before.", "Date": "January 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ontario, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGreat new year's holiday\u201d", "Author": "sdahl", "ReviewID": "UR122776648", "Content": "Check in- fast. Porter took our bags, if I had to do it again, I would have taken my bag with shorts, swimsuit in, took almost an hour for him to drop our bags off. You can find list of weekly entertainment at front desk. Pool-They do have waitress/waiter going around taking drink orders. People save chairs with towels even though there are signs discouraging this and no one enforces it. No lifeguard just pool bar tender with a whistle to control unsupervised children. Jacuzzi is part of the pool so it is the same temperature as pool. If the pool is cold, so is jacuzzi. The racoon like critters are cute and entertaining. Food-In general very good, Steak house was very good in my opinion but you had to get up early to get a reservations, reservation desk opens at 7 by entrance of main buffet. Reservations were full by 8:30 and 9 two days I inquired. Drinks-Bar staff and servers were wonderful. They had C.C., Smirnoff, Bacardi, Jose Cuervo Beer on tap,beer bottles in room fridge. I do recommend Mojitos and Blue Ocean. Rooms-clean, towel art daily, older TV and alarm clock. Free electronic safe, umbrella provided. They move furniture to clean, we heard it in the morning above us. Beach-beautiful, always able to find a few chair. Bring big insulated cooler cup, less travel to bar for small drink. In Beach Club/restaurant, wine and beer on tap to fill up your cup. Shuttle to beach runs 8- 1 and 3-6. If you walk to town, it's half hour or $7 us if you take taxi. Felt very safe and will return to this area in the future. I believe this resort is a solid 4 star, higher if located directly on the beach. There were a fair number of children probably due to the holiday break. Alot of Canadians and British people.

This is now our 28th visit to this fabulous hotel. We have just booked our places for Christmas and New Year 2012. It was so busy we don't want to miss out by not booking in time. We have been visiting several times a year since it opened in 1998 and it just gets better and better. Apart from a few showers and a little cloud we had superb weather - basking in the sun on Xmas Day and New Years Day is magic. As always the staff make the hotel - Hola and Many Thanks to Gerrado, Felipe, Rosy, David, Victor, Ana,Dahlia, Nancy, Lilian, Veronica, Cruz, Hector, Felix (Bar) and Felix and Polo (Steakhouse), Hilario, Leo, Cha-Cha, Isreal, Juan, Kevin, Mendez and a host of others who always make our stay so special and shown us such courtesey and friendliness over the years. The reception staff were unfailingly helpful. The room cleaners set a fabulous standard. The grounds are superbly maintained. The evening entertainment is of a high standard and the bar staff outstanding, despite having to deal with several rude customers. The beach is a very pleasant walk and is at the sister hotels Yucatan or Playacar and we always spend the days at the beach bar at the Yucatan, as I am not keen on sand due to a sand-fly allergy. The sea views are superb. The food is always edible and safe. The Christmas Eve and New Years Eve gala meals were just stunning and the decoration of the restaurant and foyer was inspirational. The New Years Eve party was fabulous, with a huge variety of different nationalities all having a ball together. The rooms are spacious, with four 1-litre size spirits optics and a fridge with beer, mixers and water. If you want diet mixers ask at reception and they will be supplied. We always take a travel kettle and tea bags as these are not supplied in the room and can be welcome sometimes, although the 24 hour sports bar is always available for food and drinks. The coati (racoon-like with tails) are very prevalent this year and seem to need some culling as they are breeding wildly. The agouti (guineau pig like) are less common now, probably due to the explosion of coati and the birdlife is vibrant.

I travelled with a friend as we were after a week of lying out in the sun mixed up with a bit of culture vulture-ing. Hotel: The hotel is lovely. Very clean, the staff are lovely and the situation is great. Some people say the walk to the beach is too long but I really didn't think so - Five minutes max if you're reasonably fit and don't dawdle along. If you're not up to that then there is a golf cart that was never very busy - Seemed to be busier bringing people back than taking them there. There are a few bars but the busiest in the day is the pool bar and at night is the outside bar near the stage. Drinks are really nice, they'll add in more alcohol if you want. Wine is vile (bleurgh!) so stick to the cocktails and you'll be fine. They do Liptons tea so if you want anything more than that, bring it with you - Though there is a Starbucks just a couple of minutes away from the hotel. There are mexican raccoons all around the place but we found them very entertaining. They're very cute, tend to scamper around looking for drinks and snacks but never bothered us. We always returned our empty glasses to the bar and didn't take any snacks as well as hiding our bags (with no food in) under the sunbeds. The people who seemed to have the biggest problems were those snacking, drinking or - stupidly - having thought they were cute to begin with, they'd fed them a couple of times. They're nocturnal creatures, they don't make a noise at night. Restaurants: There's three restaurants in this hotel (there's a Mexican one too but it's situated elsewhere). The main restaurant, Jalisco, does breakfast and dinner. The breakfasts are fantastic with fresh fruit, omelette stations, bacon, sausage, eggs, pancakes, cereals, toast etc. The waiters are happy to bring things over to you and it's brilliant. The dinner is also good although the food is not always 'piping' hot which is understandable considering the dishes are under warming trays - Again, common for a buffet restaurant. There is very little in the way of dress code but men can't wear sleeveless tops so take a few t-shirts at the very least. The steak restaurant 'La Lupita' was fantastic and we went twice during the stay. It's 'a la carte' - caesar salad, fried/tempura food, duo of soups and then a choice of mains followed by a baked alaska type dessert - and the steaks are amazing. Really recommend this one. It's held in the lunch restaurant by the pool and is very peaceful compared to the hustle and bustle of the main restaurant. The Asian restaurant 'Bamboo' is smaller than I thought it would be. Sushi was very good, deep fried soft-boiled egg and spinach was amazingly good (I wasn't holding out much hope!). People rave over the fried ice-cream but I thought it was particularly awful. Tasted like old fat and cream, bleurgh! Lunch is in the pool restaurant and consists of some kind of fresh meat and pasta, burgers/hot dogs and also plenty of salad, fruit, nachos, salsas etc. There's also a popcorn machine and nacho machine for you to snack on during the day. You did get up early to book the restaurants but it wasn't a problem as it was light so early and dark so early. We were up naturally by 6.30am and at breakfast for about 7. We didn't queue before breakfast (huge queue!) but went in and came back out about 15 minutes later when the queue had all but disappeared. We didn't have any trouble booking any restaurants. Room: Was a typical Riu room. Would have been nicer to have a bathroom door rather than a curtain as we were just two friends rather than a couple but it was serviceable. Definitely get a room on the 1st floor - ground floor tends to be bothered by the mexican raccoons and they don't climb up to the first floor. Optics were restocked as was the fridge and the aircon was quiet at night. Shower wasn't warm first thing in the morning, suspect it's partly warmed by solar power? Pool: Really great pool, not very kiddy when we went which was great for us but could see it getting noisy in the summer. I don't think it's the most kid-friendly resort to be honest and I preferred it that way - The guests were mostly people our age (20-30) or much older (i.e. 50+). Mostly couples, I think we were one of about three groups of friends. The swim-up bar is fabulous and the submerged sunloungers helped us stay nice and cool! Attractions nearby: - Coco Bongos = Best night of your life. Go and go through the reps so you get your own balcony as it is PACKED. - Chitchen Itza & cenote = Great tour, lunch was fine but not super. Plenty of snacks and drinks on the bus. Guides are fantastic and the scenery is insanely beautiful. Would I go again?

We have spent time at the Sandos Playacar, Moon Palace, Iberostar Quetzal/Tucan, Riu Tequila/Playacar/Yucatan. We have enjoyed each trip, but the Riu is our favorite. If you are debating between Cancun and Playa, here is the difference. Cancun has more upscale shopping, night life, and is about 30 minutes quicker to reach from the airport. Playa is more laid back, family oriented, and has palm trees on the beach at most resorts. We use to go to Cancun, but don't like to party, can shop at home, and take our kids with us. The Riu Tequila is one of the best values in the Riviera Maya and fits my family (late 30's, with 12 & 8 yr old) very well. This has been our Christmas destination for the last 5 years. We love the diversity of those staying (USA, Germany, GB, Netherlands, Spanish, Mexican, Brazilian, and many others). The grounds are always well maintained, large, and peaceful at night. Rarely does the resort feel crowded, despite its size and occupancy. The workers are incredible. The extended privileges at the Playacar and Yucatan make this trio a tremendous value. We normally eat breakfast at the Tequila and spend all day at the Playacar or Yucatan. We go during one of the busiest times of the holiday season and there are always lounges on the beach. The pool lounges go a little quicker (but we always go to the beach). The food is pretty good, with breakfast the best, but no complaints on the others as well. I have reviewed this resort a couple of times, but it seems most of those who give it negative reviews had trouble managing their expectations. I'll try to give the pros and cons and maybe that will help you decide. Whether you stay here or not, I want you to enjoy PDC as much as we do. First: This is not a 5 star resort. I see many say this as if they expected it to be. By the rankings used by US websites, it is classified as a 3.5 star out of 5. I would agree with this ranking. Also, based on price, the Tequila is usually in the lower 3rd. Don't let this scare you away. It would easily be a 4 star if located on the beach, a quick 5-10 minute walk from the lobby. Second: Have realistic expectations on the food. It is all-inclusive! There is considerable variety. Often each day the variety is similar, but wow, I don't normally have all those choices to choose from. Beef, chicken, pork, fish, salad bar, chips, the best guacamole, fresh fruit, desserts, pizza, pasta, and on and on! The reservation restaurants are a nice change of pace. It is no different than any other reservation restaurant. The reservations are limited, start at 7:00am and don't last long. If you want it, get up. If not, don't complain that the reservations are always taken. The fewer tables add to the atmosphere and specialty of the night. Service is always exceptional. Third: The rooms are not 5 star quality, as previously mentioned. If that is your goal, I would recommend the Myakoba. However, if you want good rooms at a great value, these should do. Our least favorite thing about the rooms are the hallways echo and all the late nighters coming in after midnight seem very loud. They are likely saying the same about the families that get up at 7:00! Here is my last advice. Don't be afraid to get off the resorts and go down town to the 5th Avenue area. There are several shops that have prices (no haggling) or plenty that still haggle if that's what you like. Taxi rides have gone up to $7US or 70 pesos. Churros and tacos from the street vendors are 20 & 10 pesos respectively! I never get sick in Mexico...maybe just lucky. Whether you stay here or elsewhere, enjoy the journey.

It was good in Bamboo (the Asian restaurant) but only if you love Asian food. And for the most part it was fine in the main buffet restaurant ... some nights they had a fabulous special but that changed each night. Overall, good variety however ... no complaints at all. Issues: The coffee is just so-so. There are also small machines that make coffee, if you prefer that, but they use a powder to do so. (We found one fabulous coffee machine in the pool restaurant at the Riu Yucatan across the road ... the best coffee at either resort, but only from this one machine. It used actual coffee beans instead of powder.) Service was excellent in Lupita but not in Bamboo; that is a buffet restaurant but staff bring the drinks and desert ...we ate there twice and found the staff did not greet us ... the second time it took quite a while to get drinks. Just not very friendly when compared to Lupita; this was the only place we did not leave a tip. (We did not eat at the Mexican restaurant at the Yucatan.) No coffee cup lids: They have take-out cups but no lids. By the time I walked back to our room (far from the lobby ... as most rooms are) the coffee was not hot and I had spilled 1/4 of it. VERY difficult to get a reservation for 6:45 or 7 pm seatings in the a la carte restaurants. You need to get to the lineup for that by about 7am, that morning, if you hope to get a reservation for the first seating. The concept of being forced to line up at 7am is not ideal, but the restaurants are very small so this method probably prevents hundreds of people all trying to get a reservation. (Who gets up before 7am? Not many of us did.) One strange episode: We were fourth in line at 7am and were told the 7pm seating at La Lupita was full. Hmm ... the three people ahead of us did not take all 75 seats. I asked Leo, the restaurant manager, and he claimed that once a month a group reserved La Lupita. Another person asked at the front desk and they had never heard of that! Very strange .... ... Beach: It's at the Riu Yucatan across the road ... a 7 minute walk but you can wait for the golf cart shuttle if you insist. Fabulous beach .... right near the pool area. Evening Entertainment: Ranged from boring to spectacular. You needed to arrive by about 9:15 to get a good seat and the stuff until 9:45pm was really boring. The nights when they get people up from the audience, instead of providing a show, were real yawners ... for us anyway. (A couple of evenings we went over to the Yucatan if their entertainment looked like it would be better.) The Horror show and the Moulin Rouge show were excellent. The Caribbean show was very good.

Our flight landed the same time as two others from the states so the immigration queues were huuuge!! Just be patient...as soon as you're through the huge queue your out in the sunshine! Transfer was comfortable and the rep gave us lots of useful information and also you could buy beers or water on board which was nice after waiting for what seemed like forever in Cancun airport! Transfer takes aorund an hour. Check in: Check in at the hotel was quick and we got a tasty cocktail whilst we checked in. One thing you can't fauklt at this hotel is the service. the staff will go out of thier way to please you. Rooms: I had requested a high floor and thats what a got. The room was spacious and clean. We did have an issue with a plug socket coming out of the wall but we called reception and maintanance came within ten minutes to fix the screws. The beds were huuge! Aircondition worked like a treeat and you also had the benefit of a ceiling fan for those nights that werent hot enough for the aircon ut you still needed some ait to circulate! Mini bar in the room was always full with plenty of water and soft drinks and beers. We tipped our maid quite well both weeks as we arent the tidiest of people and she always left us towel animals! :) Pool: The pool areas were lovely, i was a regular at the swim up bar...una daquri de fresa por favor! The sun beds in the pool are a great idea! nothign like lying in the heat with the cool water lapping around you. We were never up overly early, normally appeared at the pool around 10/11am and always managed to get sun beds without a problem. Food: breakfast was excellent. I liked that they had plastic/polystyrene cups that you could take out with you to the pool to keep you going until the pool bar opened. My only issue with the food is that lunch times were very repetative. we even tried over at the playacar on the beach but it was all the same. Pizza and pasta at lunch time gets a bit much! But we made do. Evening meal there was always somethign to eat. I loved the BBQ night when they had the chefs ouside on the terrace, the potatoes and chicken were fantastic! We went to the cinese and the steak a la cartes. the chinese is buffet style. We werent that hungry the night we went but it was really nice. the steak restarant was out of this world! so good we went twice!! The soup was creamy, the steaks were perfectly cooked! Delicious! The best discovery we made was at the 24hr sports bar with its huge fridges filled with food! Perfect for grabbing a midnight snack. You could heat up toasties and burgers or just have a healthy munch on some fresh fruit salad. Entertainment: I'm not one to parake in daytime activities but my other half did take part in things like water polo and water basketball which he enjoyed. They come around and ask if you want to tke part but you aren't made to feel like you have to. At night time the shows that we saw were brilliant, The costumes were fantastic! Bars: Service at all bars was excellent. The staff are always friendly and go out of thier way for you Locaton: The tequila is situated in what i can only describe as a residential area. Taxis are always waiting outside and for approx GBP3.50 you can get into playa del carmen where theres plenty of shops and bars and restaurants. We went in quite a few times, even just to break up the day if we'd had too much sun! Theres also a huuge walmart nearby. We went to buy some Lilo's and ended up taking home some Luky Charms since you cant get it in the Uk anymore! Overall I'm not one to go back to the same hotel twice but im already pricing up for next year!

The food is amazing plenty of choice for all tastes and anything which isnt available you can just ask the chef and he will endeavour to make sure it is there the next evening, There are 3 speciality restaurants the mexican, asian and the steak house, out of the 3 i would highly recommend the steak house this is the well worth a multiple visit if you have time during your stay. The other 2 are good but it does depend on your food preferences. The buffet restaurant has plenty of choice and it would be hard not to find something you can eat. The swimming pools are large and there is plenty of room for swimming and games, and also lots of shallow areas for the non swimmers to still enjoy being in the water. A short walk or golf buggy ride away is the beach with the turquoise water and white sand this is like a true postcard holiday. The staff at all the hotels in the Riu chain, playacar, yucatan and tequila are all friendly and willing to help whenever you need them, the service is impecable, especially recommend the pool bar of an evening Rosie will fix all your drinks for you and always with a big smile and anything you want to try she is happy to help by fixing this for you. If you like a shot or two on holiday this is the bar to attend. And for dancing into the early hours go along to the club after 11pm. There are also lots of trips and places to see, be aware that these are all in \u00a350+ region but are well worth this, i'd recommend for a couple nights out away from the resort go on the Pirate ship and a trip to coco bongos will definately show you a different clubbing experience. I would also recommend for the swimmers going on the Dolphin swim experience this is a must for any trip to mexico. For a few hours out of the hotel during the day take a walk down to the bird sanctuary, this is about a 20 min walk. I'd also recommend walking into town this takes about 25 mins but is a nice easy stroll and fully lit so if you are feeling engeretic the walk home is also safe. If you want a different drinking experience treat yourself to a nice cocktail in Senor Frogs placed right near the beach this is a nice relaxing place for a drink and also some fun throughout your visit courtesy of the bar and waiting staff. The thomson reps were in the hotel twice daily for 3 hours a time and were able to answer all questions and give advice where needed.

Our trip took place late December 2011. First off, I read through quite a number of these reviews before deciding upon Riu Tequila. We also received a good deal through Apple Vacations so that played a part in our decision. One thing that is important to me is good food, and a lot of the reviews stated the food was pretty good. Also, the beach is not right there, but I didn\u2019t think that would bother me too much. Well, the food was actually lacking in flavor, or got cold quickly. If you are any kind of a \u201cfoodie\u201d at all you will not enjoy the meals there. While there is quite a variety, and it is beautifully presented, most of it just lacks in quality. One thing I love is Cappuccino, at Riu it comes out of a self serve machine, and it\u2019s just not good at all. The service cannot be faulted however of the wait staff, very good. At check-in I requested certain building numbers on the second floor. I was told I would be accommodated, but when we arrived at our rooms, we were on the first floor. The room was nice, clean for the most part except for some old dead bugs in the ceilings in the bathroom. Our maid service was excellent. Had nice massages at Riu Yucatan. Went to use the sauna and Jacuzzi but we didn\u2019t have our towels with us so we couldn\u2019t use those after the massages. One thing we noticed is that we were the only ones that left tips on the tables after the meals and I am sure that if that is the case, the maids were also not tipped by other clients. But I keep reading reviews on Trip Advisor that it is important to tip servers etc. Our regular server in the dining room was actually providing better service to a couple one morning next to us that did not leave a tip! Running to provide them with juices, even though we would go get our own juices every morning. Go figure. We still tipped because we felt that we should. Lastly, it is about a 7-8 minute walk to the beach. The golf cart holds about 6-8 people and we never took it because it was either never there or there were 15 people waiting for it and it would not hold everyone. So, I found the distance to the beach inconvenient. All in all, I think there are better places to stay, and I will look for one that has better food, and is right on the beach.", "Date": "December 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cFantastic hotel and staff\u201d", "Author": "happynessmen", "ReviewID": "UR122121033", "Content": "Me and my partner stayed here 30th November to 15th December. This hotel is the best hotel either of us has stayed in. Staff They can't do enough for you, they are always smiling and you will be amazed that every time you pass them be it a cleaner bell boy or entertainment staff the always give you a warm Hola. Rooms Unfortunately my partners bed smelled a bit damp but this was because they only change the white sheets and not the brown sheet on top. Optics and mini fridge was filled up every time we put the green sign on the door. Food We enjoyed the steak house (lupita) on the first night and wow what a treat we had. Was really enjoyed ;-) We went to the Asian Resturant twice and thought this was better than the steak because as it is buffet u choose what u get as appose to steak it is set menus. The normal buffet Resturant was amazing I love the omelette chef she is always smiling and never seems to be bothered with the amount of people that she has to serve. In the evening she was replaced by a pasta chef who was just as good. Entertainment We never took part in any of the activities during the day because we done quite a lot of trips (or were 2 hungover) they put on fantastic shows and tried there best to get everyone involved. 2 best nights for me were horror night and the moulin rouge night was great (if you don't like what they are showing go over to the yuca tan across the street on the right handside of the beach walkway there entertainment was good 2) Drink I will say this though I think it's so funny how people say drinks are watered down! If they think that they obviously take there measures a bit on the large large side ;-) on the cocktail menu there is a drink called Bahama mamma. Get that but ask for Bacardi to be put in it and then grab urself a deck chair. Sheer bliss! Trips On 30th avenue there is a Walmart within that u can get cheap booze cigarettes and trips. We bought tickets to xplor there which I recommend and was roughly 50 pesos cheaper than any we had seen. We went to coco bongos and got VIP gold passes which worked out at about \u00a370 but well worth it waiter service ideal viewing area for the show and private smoking area oops forgot about the black label alcohol ;-) We really enjoyed our time in Mexico and would/will go back to same hotel ;-) thumbs up Special mention to matt Katie and Miguel of Thompsons thank you for making our time excellent!", "Date": "December 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Grimsby, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cDisappointed\u201d", "Author": "minusbeer", "ReviewID": "UR122089296", "Content": "After an hour sat on the plane we took off for mexico.

This was our first trip to Mexico with Thomson although we booked thro Tomas Cook. Arriving at the airport to bet met by a throng of helpfull local Thomson reps who got us to the Tequila efficiently and quickly. You are greeted by a beautiful vast reception area around a quadrangle with a fountain at its centre with plenty of comfortable seating with wifi connection. All the staff, reception , bars, waiters, cleaners entertainment were of the highest quality and politeness. I cant count the number of times we were greeted with a friendly smile and Hola. The 600 plus rooms are split into blocks 2 stories high amidst lush grounds with palms , hybiscus cocoa palms and banana palms with an eclectic unusual mix of wild life. The rooms had high ceilings , were airey with ceiling fans and aircon with 2 massive beds, a balcony, safe, seperate shower , wc, and wash basin dressing area which incorporated a bar with fridge which was restocked every 2 days with sodas and local spirits. We had an issue with our lights which when mentioned to reception was delat with quickly with no fuss. My only negative observations of the room was that to step into and down into the shower was a threashold of 30cm plus and if you were elderly or were using the shower after your partner and had oily feet this was an accident waiting to happen. Was a real slip hazzard in my view. Also the dressing area had some small issues of mould but we kept the cupboard doors open to make sure there was an airflow. Breakfast in the main restaurant was buffet style as is the evening meal. Food was varied and plentifull and the chefs worked very hard to keep up with the tidal wave of people that sometimes descended. Perhaps a system could be devised whereby these meals can be taken in sittings to help with this. Also negotiating your way back to your table with your plate and drink was like getting round Marble Arch with no traffic signals. The beach was a 7 min walk away or 3 by hotel golf buggy which ferrys guests throughtout the day. Here it was a wide strand with plenty of sunbeds and shade and you can use the facilities of the sister Riu hotel to take lunch and get you bar drinks. The beach restaurant service was not as good as in the Tequila as there didnt seem to many staff and the food was also not quite as good.If you wanted to stay by the pool there were again ample sunbeds and activities if you wished to participate in. The town is a 70 pesos cab away ,\u00a33.50, and taxis plentiful. Secuirty was tight and seeing armed police on highways and in Playacar was disturbing at first but is just the way of life here. The shops bars, cafes were varied and entertaining and we also visited COCO BONGO a cross between a club and show which for 110$ for VIP pass was worth the money although you can get entry for 60$ The shows at the hotel were a bit AM DRAM in comparisson. We took a day trip to Chichen Itza. The day was quite tiring as it is a 3 hour drive but worth the visit. Be warned to take breakfast and drinks with you for both the outward and return trip as there are none to buy on the way but we had a lunch there for \u00a383 trip, buffet and tour guide. On reflection we should have booked at the resort for this rather than with the holiday company Our flight was delayed by 4 hours and I thought it remiss of the rep to only inform us when we gathered at our assigned time. We were allowed to use the facilities in the hotel but as we had already checked out of our room we were only allowed to changed in the toilets off the main reception.

It's very well maintained, clean, with very nice and large rooms, comfortable beds, excellent housekeeping, very nice bathrooms, etc. Food: We did not think the food was brilliant. It was excellent in Lupita (the steak a la carte restaurant) and the service was as well. It was good in Bamboo (the Asian restaurant) if you love Asian food. And for the most part it was fine in the main buffet restaurant ... some nights they had a fabulous special but that changed each night. Overall, good variety however ... no complaints at all. Issues: The coffee is just so-so. There are also small machines that make coffee, if you prefer that, but they use a powder to do so. (We found one fabulous coffee machine in the pool restaurant at the Riu Yucatan across the road ... the best coffee at either resort, but only from this one machine. It used actual coffee beans instead of powder.) Service was excellent in Lupita but not in Bamboo; that is a buffet restaurant but staff bring the drinks and desert ...we ate there twice and found the staff did not greet us ... the second time it took quite a while to get drinks. Just not very friendly when compared to Lupita; this was the only place we did not leave a tip. (We did not eat at the Mexican restaurant at the Yucatan.) No coffee cup lids: They have take-out cups but no lids. By the time I walked back to our room (far from the lobby ... as most rooms are) the coffee was not hot and I had spilled 1/4 of it. VERY difficult to get a reservation for 6:45 or 7 pm seatings in the a la carte restaurants. You need to get to the lineup for that by about 7am, that morning, if you hope to get a reservation for the first seating. The concept of being forced to line up at 7am is not ideal, but the restaurants are very small so this method probably prevents hundreds of people all trying to get a reservation. (Who gets up before 7am? Not many of us did.) One strange episode: We were fourth in line at 7am and were told the 7pm seating at La Lupita was full. Hmm ... the three people ahead of us did not take all 75 seats. I asked Leo, the restaurant manager, and he claimed that once a month a group reserved La Lupita. Another person asked at the front desk and they had never heard of that! We suspect that some people tipped the staff in the evening to get a reservation for the next evening. Otherwise, why could we not get a table?? ... Beach: It's at the Riu Yucatan across the road ... a 10 minute walk but you can wait for the golf cart shuttle if you insist. Fabulous beach .... right near the pool area. Evening Entertainment: Ranged from boring to spectacular. You needed to arrive by about 9:15 to get a good seat and the stuff until 9:45pm was really boring. The nights when they get people up from the audience, instead of providing a show, were real yawners ... for us anyway. (A couple of evenings we went over to the Yucatan if their entertainment looked like it would be better.) The Horror show and the Moulin Rouge show were excellent. The Caribbean show was very good. In spite of the issues that I mentioned, we rated it Excellent overall.

Hotel It is very clean and has a wow about it, very open but still welcoming. The pool area is lovely not the best for sunbathing unless you get up early, the pool also doesnt get much sun, unless you are know about were to put you sunbed!!! The only bad thing which i didnt mind but others hated it was the local animals round the hotel if you didnt watch your food and drinks by the pool it would be gone, they were cute thow just dont feed them Rooms They are very clean and big, beds are amazing and you get towel animals left for you. You get a mini bar with beer, pop and water and also opitics in the room. The shower was fab!!!!! the only odd thing was the weird curtins that split your sleeping area with your wash area??? The hair dryer in the room is really powerfull if your worried bout your suite case weight. Food Is the best i have had in a hotel, this i was worried about as in my job i eat in alot of different hotels and as a fussy eater offen gone hungery, but it was different here!!!! i always found something i could eat and most of all enjoy aswell. They have near enough everything. They have 4 different resturants that you can eat in of an evening, the main buffet, and 3 al'carte resturants. You can eat here as may times as you like but you have to get up early to book them. It is worth it!!!! Bars You can get all your branded drinks from the bars and even cocktails. Just be aware of the tequila shots!!!! The only thing you cant get is corona but the beer is alrite. Day time activities It is fab if you like joining in they have everything from darts, horseshoes to water polo and beach volly ball, best thing if you win you get a prize!!!!! Evening entertament It isnt the best and it isnt the worst and is different every night, you can have loads of fun people watching. The beach is beautiful power white sand you get sunbeds and theres loads so you shouldnt have a problem getting one. You can use the other riu thats on the beach to get food and drinks. The beach is only 5 to 10mins walk away but its a really nice walk.

The hotel grounds are beautifully maintained as are all of the reception and sitting areas. The rooms were cleaned to perfection and Nellie the housekeeper did a wonderful job. The food was absolutely brilliant and so much choice. Anyone that wants to complain about the food is just downright fussy as there is literally something for everyone one. We visited the steakhouse restaurant and had a lovely meal but to be honest there was so much choice in the main restaurant that we didn't feel it necessary to try the other restaurants. There is lots of day time entertainment around the pool if you want it and the same staff that have had to entertain and play games all day are the same staff that perform the shows in the evening. The Mayan show was particularly great. A short walk away is the beach and you can use the facilities at the Riu Lupita and this was a real bonus. The beach is absolutely beautiful and the fact that you can have the use of a cayak, catamaran and body board for an hour a day was a great touch. There are lots of people selling wares on the beach which was great for me as I could shop and sunbathe at the same time and bought some great bargains. Silver, cigars, pottery and if you weren't interested you weren't pestered. I would recommend going to Wall Mart to purchase any day trips, which is a 100 peso cab journey from hotel or about a 50 minute walk We had a day trip to Coba which included going to a senote, a mayan village, lunch and then a guided tour around the ruins all for \u00a340 which was almost half of the price of the tour offered by Thompson. I would also recommend that you change up your pesos before you go or take American dollars as they don't seem to like english money and I got a better exchange rate on line. We couldn't use our debit cards anywhere but you can use your credit card. The reps were really friendly and always available if you needed them. There is a small library where people have left there books behind and this was great as when we'd finished our books we had a good choice of other reading material. They also have a box where you could leave your left over suntan cream, hairspray etc. I would suggest that you don't bother with bringing your toiletries with you but going to wallmart and buying them all there as it was so much cheaper and meant your luggage wasn't so heavy on your outbound journey. The flight on the way back was delayed but we were left at the hotel to continue using their facilities instead of having to wait at the airport. My only gripe would be that this is the first time I have done a package tour and the first long haul flight where there aren't complimentary drinks and snacks throughout the flight. The crew with the exception of two staff were not very friendly and I witnessed them being downright rude to several passengers. However, this is only a minor and didn't detract from the fact that this was probably the most relaxing holiday I have every had. Great holiday for people of all ages and I will definitely be returning to this hotel in the future but will purchase my flight seperately. Tips: Avon skin So Soft is great for avoiding mosquito bites. Bring a travel kettle and tea bags if you want a morning cuppa without having to go to the restaurant to bring one back. Ask for a room overlooking the golf course if you like quiet and privacy.

From the moment we arrived the staff were very welcoming and happy to help with the quick processing on checking in. We went to our room which was easy to find with the resort signs and the room was very clean and a reasonable size. The bathroom is separated by the main bedroom by a curtain with the toilet in a separate room again. In the bathroom area there is a fabulous mini bar with four spirit optics, below in the mini fridge beers soft drinks and bottles of water. This is topped up every other day but if required you could ask reception to top it up in between if necessary. The rooms are cleaned every day to a high standard with towel animals and rose petals left on different days. The food at the resort was very good. Ive been to all inclusive hotels before and often found that mid afternoon food is difficult to get from the main areas however in the Tequilla the lunch time buffet remains out untill around 1800hrs and dinner begins in the main restaurant at 1830hrs. The main restaurant had the usual chips/pizza/burgers menu everyday but the selection of other dishes changed every day and it was vast. There are also three restaurants you can book separately from the buffet. 'The oriental is a fine but we was disappointed by the mexican restaurant on the beach. The food wasnt quiet the local cuisine we expected. The steak house however was clearly a winner for most guests as was booked up quickly most nights. The pool area was very clean everyday and sun loungers were easy to get in the morning. The beach is only a short walk away across the road and next to the sister hotel. The entertainment was good at the hotel although not always to our taste but you can tell the staff work extremely hard and are always friendly and happy to help out if you need anything.

The staff are brilliant and generally very humourous and like a laugh. The beach vendors were not pushy like some countrys can be. They sell excursions on the beach which are reasonably priced and ours worked out well. We did 2 trips one to Xel-Ha pronounced (Shell-Ha) which was fab, we were going to do a combined one with Tulum but glad we just did Xel-Ha on its own as you really do need the whole day there, There is a lazy river which you go down on rubber rings and can stop off to do snorkelling or cliff jumping but would recommend the zip lines, they were funny. We also did the Tulum trip combined with Paraiso beach booked from beach seller. Would have liked more time at the beach but its was amazing. The food is the best all inclusive buffet I have had. Such a variety for everyone. I am a bit of a picky eater but I always found plenty of things to eat and unfortunately more :) The beach was long and good long walks each side. Off to the left if facng the beach is Playa Del Carmen about 30 mins walk and off to the right are where the pelicans sit on the rocks, some amazing photo opportunities there. Do wear bug spay as I was bitten twice by a big fat looking fly up by the rocks. I would recommend lots of sun screen, it may not seem too hot but the sun is really strong there. There is a snorkelling reef about 15 mins walk to the right which is good. The fish swarm around you if you give them banana, they absolutely love it. Not much snorkelling on the rest of the beach tho. Every morning outside our balcony at 6am was a cat and a coati waiting for food scraps. We were in 1803 so if your there the cat likes ham :) All sorts of wildlife out there, Monkeys at the Riu Yucatan accross the street, coati creatures at the Tequila along with birds and some other rodent type creeatures Czerecki or somethiing like that.

Its not the animals fault its the idiots that feed them even though the management asks them not to. For this reason and this reason only I would not go back to this hotel.

Secondly, it would have been nice to have had waiter service at the speciality restaurants. Flight was good, although we came back on a new plane with touch screen controls on the games console.The Suduko squares were so small it didn't recognise what I was typing in so I gave up in the end. Our room was just was just what we wanted. It was clean and comfortable, we came back to some fab towel designs each day. The food was really good, there was a great choice and there was something for everyone. Really liked the Asian Restaurant. Did some good snorkelling trips. The first was with Mayan Adventures. Our guide called Jesus was great, he took us to a cenote, a cave and then into the sea. They were all brilliant although I managed to fall off the Zip Wire into the lake! Loved the cave but glad I had taken my wetsuit. On the last snorkelling stop, I thought our guide was taking us into a river, but it was an inlet from the sea, we went straight into a shoal of sardines,saw a barracuda and several sting rays. The next trip we went to Xel-Ha. We loved this day out too, it was lovely drifting through a mango tunnel in a ring, we saw dolphins and I managed to do the Zip wire without falling off. We had the best night of our lives at Coco- Bongos night club. It is suitable for all ages, it was part show and part night club. Streamers were constantly coming down from the ceiling, along with balloons and carbon dioxide. A little guy spent all night trying to sweep up, it was crazy especially with Spiderman fighting in front of us. We were buzzing for ages afterwards and still cannot believe it. Our daughters who are in their twenties agree that it is their favourite night club too. We loved the walk through The Yucatan Hotel to the beach but liked the Tequila because it felt a little more secluded. the whole area was exceptionally clean, taxis into Player Del Carmen charged a flat rate of 7 dollars whatever time of day or night they were needed.

Overall we had a really good time. The bus ride from the airport was almost 2 hours as we had 3 drop-offs at other hotels before reaching the Riu. Once there, we were met by friendly staff and check in was quick with a refreshing fruit drink. Our return trip took only an hour and 15 minutes. We had a room towards the rear of the property on the 2nd. floor which is the top floor. There are a number of villas with about 16 rooms per floor. Throughout the entire week the water pressure was outstanding and the water almost too hot. This was great, as we have been in some hotels where it was not so good. Along with the normal bar fridge pop & beer, they replenished the drinking water daily. We found our bed & 4 pillows to be fine. On our return home, we did notice that our clothes had a musty smell, but it seems to be gone now that the washing has been done. Overall, we found the buffets - breakfast, lunch & dinner - to be of good and varied quality. As soon as an item was running low, a new dish would appear, even the bacon in the morning. Not all resorts are attentive to this. And yes, the bacon was good - not salty and porky like we have experienced at other resorts. On two days we had our lunch at the Riu Yucatan - beach - and found their luncheon buffets not anywhere as nice as ours. There just wasn't the choices available. At our pool restaurant, there was popcorn, nachos & cheese sauce, and soft ice cream / cones available all afternoon. It wasn't the best ice cream, but lots of people were having them - us included. We went to the steak house twice and the Asian restaurant once. The steak house is actually the pool restaurant at night so is really outdoors. The tables were done nicely, and the menu was pre-set except for your entree....ie: nice crusty bun, caesar salad, soup, and deep fried type appetizers, and your desert. The 2 nights we were there, our entrees consisted of rib steaks and ribs. The steaks were tasty but not overly tender and the ribs were side ribs, but tasty. We went to the 7 pm sitting, so things were a little rushed as they were trying to get ready for the 9 pm sitting. We all thought the wine was different than the buffet, and we thought it was weak, but we still consumed a lot. The Asian restaurant was good - totally buffet, and the food was good. We all had the deep fried ice-cream which we all enjoyed. The bar service for the entire week was oustanding. In the evenings by the enertainment area, they have 2 bars and well staffed, ie: one night I counted 8 bartenders in the bar we were at. The Black Russians and Brown Cows were great. The shows were typical, but there were a few really good nights. The theatre was full everynight, and we did discover that people were coming to our bar from the Riu Yucatan which they said was dead. There were vendors on the walkways 2 nights, and 2 nights of games in the lobby area. At times the cotamunday's could be a little bothersome as they will try and take your drinks around the pool. The walk to the beach is about 7 to 8 minutes from the lobby. Once there, there are a lot of loungers, and you can walk in either direction, 20-25 minutes on a beautiful soft sand beach. We found that the loungers in the 2 pool areas disappeared quickly especially if they were the onces that would get a fair amount of sun throughout the day. For me to give a 5 star rating, I would need the property to be on the beach and it would have to provide 2-3 true a la carte restaurants with great food.", "Date": "December 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Canada", "Title": "\u201cService Par Excellance\u201d", "Author": "Newfie12", "ReviewID": "UR121325990", "Content": "Riu Tequila is one of 5 RIU hotels in Playacar, and in my mind has to be the best!

Both times we stayed with 2 kids as a family of 4. I love the layout and the design of this hotel. The pool area is great and really gives you plenty of shades and the illusion of having a pool in the middle of a jungle. The landscaping gives you more privacy than your normal mega resort. The landscaping of the entire area is top notch and this is what really differentiate this hotel from most other hotels. The common areas are also above average with a great lobby area, theater, separate sports bar with pool tables, 3 restaurants, and a kids club by the pool. The pool also has a swim-up bar and you have access to beach volleyball, basketball, table tennis etc. The property is only about a 5 minutes walk from the beach across the street and we had no problem walking there when we wanted to hang out there at the Riu Yucatan. By the way, you can use all facilities at the Yucatan if you stay at the Tequila. I believe the only exception is dinner. I personally would stay at the Tequila because I like that property better and it is normally cheaper than the Yucatan by a few hundred dollars. When we were there during the Thanksgiving week, I think at least 50% of the guests were British, and the rest were mostly American, Canadian and other Europeans. This all-inclusive resort serves food that is definitely forgettable. I have not found a single dish that I would call \"outstanding\" and a bit of a disappointment...compared to a better cruise for instance. I think the breakfast selection is great with almost all types of European and American choices. The lunch buffet is borderline bad with very few selection and lack of taste. The dinner is much better in terms of service and selection. The waiting staff is working very hard and they do remember you and your beverage preferences. They have two restaurants with reservation only, but we only tried the Asian restaurant this year....and we went back to the buffet the same day. The entertainment staff is working extremely hard to keep you busy and I really like the way they try to motivate you to participate. Activities include, volleyball, waterpolo, water basketball, water aerobics, ping-pong, darts, football, etc. At night the theater comes alive around 8:30 first with child and adult participation. My kids told me that the child theater participation program was pretty good, but they should skip the embarrassing dancing part and keep the game part. Finally a show which could be a local Mexican cultural presentation, mariachi band with a singer or a Broadway-like show. We had Mamma Mia which was a big hit with the audience...but not for me. One piece of advice... You may want to check out the first \"participation\" show before you volunteer. The room has 2 double beds and we asked for an extra bed for one of the kids. The bathroom is fairly spacious with a separate rooms for shower, toilet and closet for the clothes. The fridge is stocked every other day with soft drinks beer etc, and you have separate dispensers with 4 different types of liquors. I think tequila, vodka, whiskey and gin. We don't really drink so this was really not a big plus for us. One unique thing about this property is that you can experience some wildlife here since it is in a jungle...There are lots of cool birds, small wild pigs, and lots of Mexican racoons can be spotted. They are totally harmless and I think they are there because guests are feeding them. My kids and most of the guests just totally loved it, but I think this could get out of hand when you see a pack of 20 racoons around the dining area looking for food. If you would like to get out of the resort you can get a taxi for 70 pesos to the shopping center where you can even catch a ferry to Cozumel. Definitely try to see Chitzen Itza and the cenotes.

We have just returned from 2 weeks there and cannot fault one single thing. Don't want to repeat what everyone else has already said but the staff, resort, rooms, service, people and tropical paradise surroundings are simply brilliant. A couple of people have mentioned the entertainment shows in the evening were just \"ok\" - totally disagree! The entertainment staff in this resort are working 70-90 hour weeks with only one day off and they put on some amazing shows, some superb professional dancing and each night there were different 'games' to involve the crowd which were always very funny... At the end of each night they get as many people up out of the crowd to do the \"Riu Tequila dance\" - very funny and entertaining. Special mention to Crazy James who quite badly hurt his hand while we were there (dislocated his finger too) and was still lifting the female dancers in the shows - a real professional... They deserve every accolade for their hard work. I have to comment on the people - everyone we came into contact with was chatty, friendly and very good at their jobs.. Reception, entertainment, waiting staff and housekeeping were all so good at what they did. We tipped heavily when it was warranted as many of these guys don't get paid a lot and yet continue to deliver amazing service (the UK could definitely learn a lesson or two from these people!). Our Maid was incredible (Meia).. Our room was spotlessly cleaned every day, drinks always topped up and her towel art animals each day were incredible (it was an art in itself as we watched her do it one day).. We tipped her every day and one day she left us a lovely single red rose.. Little things like that just give you a smile and make you feel valued as a customer :-) All in all I would say this is one of the best locations I have ever stayed in. Considering it was the cheapest monetarily we found it far superior to the other hotels locally and were delighted we chose the Riu Tequila. You will be too if you book it!

Nice powerfull shower and big cubicle, also liked the idea of seperate bathroom and toilet curtained off and the additional dressing room. Bars and drinks were of the usual excellent RIU standard, and optics and fridge in the room a major plus, if like us you like the occasional nightcap or night in after a long day in the sun.

Pools were very good and always found a nice spot, comfortable sunbeds, and waiter coming round the beds for drink orders was a nice touch too. Animation team excellent, left you alone if you wanted to just relax and kept you occupied if you wanted entertainment / excersise / education. Shows were some of the best we have seen. The Standard of the food was very good indeed, both in quality and choice. I had a really good steak in the steakhouse ( twice i might add), a very good asian buffet in the bamboo restaraunt, and very good food in the main restaraunt, most nights including a Barbeque as well.

It was good, BUT please note that the rooms are probably past their best days, the grout in-between the tiles everywhere are chipped and appear dirty, although it probably just needs regrouting. The room had a definate smell to it, almost damp and we left our patio door open with the ceiling fan going all night to get some fresh air in to the room. Due to the humidity sheets did feel damp and everything took ages to dry. The room does come equipped with a mini bar that gets restocked every second day. The actual hotel has 664 bedrooms which are spread out over quite a large area. Gardens are immaculate and look very pleasant. The pool area is nicely laid out with plenty of loungers. The pool bar serves all drinks you can think of including cocktails. Food was very good, a good selection. We booked the steak house twice and the steaks were very good, they definately use different scales than in the UK because a 8oz steak fills your plate! The Asian restaurant food was pretty good too, just remember to ask for the fried ice cream at the end! The beach is located a 10 minute walk away, there are plenty of sun loungers too and the water is very warm. The animals were great. The Coatimundi's can be a handful, but if you treat them with respect they behave, don't leave any food unattended, unless you of course want to feed them! Some general advice, the airport at Cancun is cheaper than the shops for cigarettes. If flying with Thomson, get yourself some drinks in the duty free area of whichever airport you leave from because drinks are quite expensive on the plane. We found the leg room very adequate despite other reviews. We also received free headphones and had access to plenty of movies free of charge. If you want to go to Playacar's 5th avenue for shopping, turn left out the hotel, stay on the right hand side and enjoy the 30-40 minute walk, it was worth it.

The rooms were fairly basic but had everything in there that you needed, hairdryer, iron and ironing board, fridge with soft drinks and optics. They top these up every two days.

Also you can use the pool bar and the beach restaurants at the Yucatan and we never struggled for a sunbed. Plenty of choice food wise. Pancakes, omeletes, fruit, cereal, continental breakfasts. Snacks, fresh pasta, salads, burgers etc for lunch and pretty much everything you can think of on the evening. The Steak restaurant is deffinatley worth a visit which is a set menu. Loads of drinks on the menu, cocktails were amazing! The bars shut about 12 at night but then the club and the sports bar open later with food in the sports bar to soak up all the alcohol!

We noticed that they have repainted; it's very clean compared to other places - the staff are always around cleaning up and attending to the foliage; very friendly folks! Prices have gone up for a taxi - used to be $5 US or 50 Pesos - now it's $7 or 70 pesos - pay in pesos - it's a little cheaper; have small change - sometimes they don't have it so you'll have to ask at the hotel. It appeared to me that the rooms have been updated as well - new beds - firm but comfortable. Of course the bathroom is still the same - my only wish would be that they put an extra electrical outlet in the vanity area - for hair straighteners, etc. However, they have flatscreen TV's now. The daily menu could use an upgrade but nothing to really complain about - I guess I've been spoiled - stayed at the Riu Palace in Dominican 2 years ago - excellent meals. The hotel has WiFi but I had a tablet and it was very slow for some reason. However there is an \"internet cafe\" at the Sports Bar - it's called Info@bar. This is my one caveat. They just rent space from the hotel as do other vendors. I paid for one hour of internet time - $8 US - with in and out privileges. As my hour was almost over I asked for an additional hour to be added on - paid a further $8;when my first hour was over I was automatically logged off; I explained to the new rep the next day that I paid for an additional hour but she had no record of it;told me to wait for the rep that I saw the day before - the problem was that he didn't arrive until 3 p.m. and we were leaving that day at 3:30 pm; he was there - I explained that my additional hour was not added on to my sign in ticket code - he said that he gave me a new ticket code for the additional hour. So here's the bottom line - I did not get a new ticket code and he did not have a record of the transaction - ???? After a \"few words\" he gave me a new ticket but by that time it was almost 3:30 and I wouldn't have had time to use it;they don't refund any money;the new ticket was only valid for one week so I couldn't even keep it for next year. I asked to speak to the manager - he was in Cancun and they would not give me his email address to voice my complaint. So I lost the $8 - I know it is not much but it's the principle. So all I can say is if you use their service, every time you buy more internet time, make sure you get a new timecode ticket! I'll know for next time - if we go back; this had nothing to do with the hotel - so I'm not blaming the Riu.

Had a great time - even our 16 year old daughter was happy - with sun, sand, food, drink and FREE INTERNET in the reception lobby ( don't think she would have coped without regular facebook contact!!).", "Date": "November 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Blackpool, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cIf Carlsberg did 30th's........:-)\u201d", "Author": "Cazza30_11", "ReviewID": "UR120383231", "Content": "For my 30th Birthday in December 2010 I wanted to be on a gorgeous beach, cocktail in hand with my nearest and dearest in the sunshine to numb the pain of hitting the big 3 0! I chose the Riu Tequilla as the flights matched exactly for thr dates and durations I wanted flying on the 01st December for 10nights (my 30th being the 07th). There are a few Riu properties in Playa del Carmen but I chose the Tequilla as it was well priced and had good reviews on here and various other sites we use in the travel industry. The hotel is not set right on the beach but just across the road with a shuttle buggy running there and back all day every day. However, after a very hearty breakfast we quite enjoyed the walk to the beach each day to feel like we were getting our share of exercise. The Riu Tequilla has the most gorgeous lobby and open reception area which is really quite stunning on arrival. The rooms are spread out in stunning and incredibly well kept gardens in a jungle feel format. Rooms are very spacious and airy and have two double beds, bathroom and minibar with optics! Everywhere is kept immaculate and spotlessly clean and all day there is an army of people cleaning away, tending to the gardens and busy basically making sure you are happy. Excellent choice of food in the buffet resturants although the speciality ones dont change their menus much. You wouldnt get bored though over two visits to each. Food very good! Half an hours walk along a breathtaking beach brings you to Playa del Carmen which is a lovely little resort and what I call 'real mexico' no high rise comercialised tower blocks to be seen like Cancun. Small little streets lined with boutiques and classy bars and enough nightlife to keep you going if you wanted it. On my 30th the hotel decorated my room with balloons,banners and towel art and my Mum had the most beautiful flowers delivered for me. That evening we had a fab meal in the steakhouse where again I was made a fuss of before heading into Playa del Carmen for a night of partying in Coco Bongos. Trust me this is well worth a visit and a trip to Mexico not complete without. My parents are nearing 60 and came along. They loved it as its not just a nightclub but a fantastic show too.Ask the hotel reps to escourt you there and they'll get you a table with a all inclusive waiter service drinks package. Lots of great excursions to do along this stunning coastline including swimming with the dolphins (which I did at Xel Ha on my 30th) and catermeran snorkling trips too. (Fat Cat) took us on this one from Puerto Aventuras. All in all the most wonderful wonderful time ever at the Riu Tequilla and Mexico is simply stunning. Hotel excellent, food, drink, staff, location just everything perfect. On my return my friends asked me to recommend a hotel for them for their wedding and they booked the Tequilla. They too came home with rave reviews and said how happy they were that I had recomended it to them. I really couldnt have chosen a better way to spend my 30th or a better place hence the title of this review. Just perfect in every single way and happy memories of an amazing holiday I will treasure forever!

In summary: Staff - fabulous throughout the complex. Animation team one of the hardest working I have ever encountered. Rooms - dark, dated but have everything required for a clean and comfortable stay. Ground floor rooms noisy with maids setting up trolleys from 7am. Food - Buffet has a good selection. Didn't get bored but wish there was bigger choice of vegetables. Mexican restaurant - food good but lacks atmosphere, Steak house - good food, good atmosphere. Haven't done the Asian but heard positive reports. Lunch buffet - adequate selection with variety of hot dishes each day and fresh salads. Sports bar food is to be kept as emergency rations. It has a poor choice for vegetarians. Pools - Sad to say its the Brits who reserve loungers and then disappear back to bed. Beach close enough and guaranteed beds. Bars - staff wonderful, drink quality variable but good choice and staff knock themselves out to give you what you want. Pool bar (Lupita) quiet in the evening as opposed to the entertainment area which gets very busy. Areas for improvement - would be nice to have child free bar, smoke free area in lobby, We spent a couple of nights in Cozumel and had a wonderful time away from the AI atmosphere. Some great bars and the island has a nice vibe if you can ignore the taxi drivers and sellers trying to get your attention.

Premium upgrade was a waste of time, Thomson downgraded the plane so got small seats. Second time this year. Return flight had broken seats! Thomson being very tight on credit. Taxi transfer was good, from touchdown to the hotel room, was 100 minutes. Spoke to other people who spent 160 minutes in the airport getting thru customs etc and then 60 minutes transfer. After a slow 11 hour flight we just want to get to the room, relax, eat and early night. Room The room was sensibly sized with 2 double beds, enough storage space to store all our clothes and to get two large suitcases out of the way in the wardrobe. Smashing walk-in shower and never ran out of hot water! I couldn\u2019t believe the room didn\u2019t have a coffee-maker/kettle, so I walked miles to get a cuppa each morning so my wife would talk to me. Yep \u2013 I have checked the brochure and coffee maker is not shown in the facilities, but I had just assumed all the basics would be there like walls, floor and a coffee-maker. Unfortunately the air-con worked really well, the room was set at 15degress when we arrived and in the rainy season when it is humid, and you drop the temperature, you get condensation. We turned the air-con off, but the room sometimes felt damp, and a camera case and some clothes we hadn\u2019t used became mouldy in the two weeks. The room was clean and Eddy our cleaner did a great job, but he did like turning all the room lights on all day! Could have used a few more towels in the room, especially ones that would go round me. Could have used a 240volt electric supply as well. ( Electric fans over the pool bar to keep you cool while you were sat on a bar stool in the water didn\u2019t seem to be particularly energy conscious either) Our first trip to a Riu hotel, so I liked the idea of the optics but not the default choice of bottles. Was much happier when they added a bottle of scotch. Restaurant/Food/Dress code Official dress code is pretty relaxed but men are requested to wear shirts at evening meals and that doesn\u2019t include vest tops.( Hairy armpits for the men a big no-no, didn't see many on the ladies either) The ladies generally made a real effort in the evenings with most wearing dresses and flashing lots of tanned flesh. A personal observation ladies, posh frocks and trainers aren\u2019t top of the fashion stakes for me. The gents seem not to care, with baggy shorts, football shirts and the reversed baseball cap being a frequent effort. I can understand a baseball player wearing a baseball cap; I can even understand them in the sunshine, but reversed at 10pm in an indoor restaurant seems a touch too far. Still, no hoodies! Dress code around the pool was very reserved with very few bon-bons on display! Food Our biggest disappointment was the lack of variety in the food and the cramped canteen-like feeling. We like a long, relaxed meal; rather than a fuel-stop and managed to eat outdoors on the balcony for most meals. I realise that this opinion differs from that of many other guests; we met some repeat visitors who thought the food excellent and we met one couple who came back this year and were so disappointed that they changed hotels for their second week. We didn\u2019t go hungry, there was always enough choice so you could find something pleasant. The quality and freshness were also good. Some sea-food would have been nice. The menu board had a section for the carvery, but it was always blanked-out! Breakfast was good. Cereals, eggs cold meats, fruit etc etc., Lunch at the pool restaurant ( Lupita) was unbelievingly boring with the same limited choices every day. Salad bar, rice, potato, chicken drumsticks, small steaks, small pork steaks, burgers, hot dogs and pasta. Sounds good, but really so repetitive that I even tried a cold brussel sprout with my salad for a bit of variety. ( Won\u2019t try that again). We also found the evening buffet boring- the best nights for us were the BBQ evenings when at least there was real meat instead of pasta, minute steaks and pork chops, burgers etc The oriental restaurant made a change, but was so uninspiring- not as good as our local \u201ceat all you can for a \u00a310\u201d. The first to leave were an oriental family! The steak house was good ( at least you could get some real meat); we went 4 times although the menu was identical on every trip. We didn\u2019t try the Mexican due to bad reports from other guests! Staff Friendly and helpful, but we felt the standard of English had fallen since our previous trip to Mexico. Good enough for the waiters and bar-staff but not for having a chat about how they live etc. Hotel Shop Ridiculous prices- walk 200 yards to the plaza, save 50% but still expensive. Wildlife. Aah! Aren\u2019t they cute? Well \u2013 within limits, Yes! The birds are expert at stealing sachets of sugar off the tables, but they seem to prefer sweetener to the sugar! The Coati look lovely but you can go off them when they climb on the tables and take food, they also like diving into your bags left round the pool, or climbing onto your patio. They are tame enough to eat from your hand. The teeth look sharp enough to eat your hand! In my view, there are far too many of them! Guess I shouldn\u2019t suggest a cull or relocating some back to the jungle., in case I upset someone. The sereque ( or Agouti) are much less numerous and tend to be much happier keeping away from humans; but then most rodents are! Cats- far too many of them. I won\u2019t suggest getting them neutered. Only saw one large lizard and not many geckoes. Got bitten a couple of times in the first couple of days - don\u2019t know if it was ants or mosquitoes. Hotel did use the mossie gun twice while we were there. Entertainment Didn\u2019t play darts, didn\u2019t play shuffleboard, didn\u2019t DO anything. Did see kids being entertained on stage while we were having a pre-dinner drink- How boring! Almost prefer watching Emmerdale back home( no \u2013 that\u2019s a joke) Back to adults only hotel next time! Never saw the evening entertainment. Overall Not our favourite resort, although lots of other folk really enjoyed it.

Food was fantastic. My husband is a very fussy eater, & there is something for everyone's taste. I thoroughly enjoyed the pasta station where you could chose what you wanted in it and then it was cooked for you while you waited. There is also a Steak house, Indian & Mexican resturant that you can book before 10.30 at the breakfast entrance for that evening if you fancy a change from the enormous buffet. Food sculptures were absolutely fantastic. Really top quality. The hotel was very clean & rooms were cleaned every day. Staff were so friendly,Bar staff were really on the ball, if you gave them a tips early in your vacation as soon as you'd finish your drink another one was on its way. What i thought was really great for an all inclusive, was that the spirits was imported, proper Gordons Gin, Smirnoff Vodka, Jim Bean Whiskey & Bacardi, not the usual local stuff. In your rooms there is a FREE mini bar that is re-stocked every two days, there is also an Optic in your room with local Rum, Vodka, Gin & of course Tequilla. There is a beautiful beach, soft white sand, palm trees and of course clear blue sea with lots of sun beds about 10 minutes walk away (well worth the walk) or you can wait for the extended golf buggy which carrys up to 7 people, I heard many people say that they'd been to the Riu Tequilla many times before, and i can see why, its definately a place that you could return to year after year (if you can stand the 10 and a half hour flight.). The weather was a bit hit and miss, but it was October, hurricane season. I just love the sun, but even after 4 days of heavy rain non stop I still loved it, There was entertainment every evening, & the entertainment team really did pull out all the stops, even the rainy days they were getting everyone involved with games etc. I shall definately be going back next year & hopeully it will be for 3 weeks not two.

We were delayed for 24 hours coming home due to \u2018Hurricane Rina\u2019 which was actually downgraded to a Tropical storm; the staff were great during this time. They went about the task of battening everything down with calm efficiency. The rooms are quite spacious and clean. The towel art is very clever, we ended up with six altogether including a rabbit, elephant and dinosaur! The fridge and optics are replenished every two days. Two drawbacks: due to the humidity the rooms are musty but this can be alleviated by turning off the air conditioning and opening the door (do leave the screen closed to keep out the bugs), secondly it would be nice if a kettle was provided. Of course you can take coffee back from the restaurant but it\u2019s likely to be cold by the time you get to your room. The food at lunchtime is better in the Lupita restaurant by the pool. The Beach restaurant is very limited, although if you walk around to the side that is in the Yukatan, it is slightly better. The Asian restaurant is very cold! Take a sweater if you decide to eat in there. In my opinion the food is no better than in the main restaurant but our friends enjoyed the Sushi. Apparently the deep fried ice cream is excellent, but it didn\u2019t appeal to me, so I gave it a miss. The Lupita doubles as the Steakhouse in the evening and we didn\u2019t have any problems getting a reservation. Other reviewers have said that they were fully booked really early but we had no problems at all, one day we did not book until 9:30am. Breakfast in the main restaurant had lots of choice, my favourite being the fruit smoothies and the omelette counter; pick your ingredients and the chef makes if for you. They do the same for pasta dishes in the evening. On Sunday morning Bucks Fizz is served as you enter and be aware that sugar is not kept on the tables on the outside veranda because the birds steal the packets! Do try the blue cheese, it\u2019s delicious. Ricardo, the barman in the pool bar, is great fun! All the staff are brilliant and it was lovely to be served with a smile and without an attitude! Their service is impeccable; our loo flush broke, we phoned reception and in less than five minutes maintenance were there and it was fixed. Similarly our friend\u2019s electricity went off and again, in less than five minutes after reporting the problem, it was fixed. We spent quite a lot of time on the beach. The sunbeds were plentiful but obviously those closest to the sea went first. Take some bread or a banana with you to take in the sea because the fish will take it from your hand. One morning we must have had about seventy fish swimming around us \u2013 fantastic! We got up for the sunrise and walked as far as we could along the beach (toward the right as you face the sea) and it was well worth it. There are deserted coves and there were areas cordoned off where the loggerhead turtle eggs had been relocated. If you only do one trip, a visit to Sian Ka\u2019an is highly recommended. It is absolutely worth the bone shaking ride on the monster truck. It is an 85 square kilometre ecotourism and education centre. We saw a loggerhead turtle, dolphins, fish, pelicans, vultures, frigates and osprey, all in their natural habitat. We had a fabulous guide, Terence Hills, a Canadian who has been lucky enough to make his home in Mexico. There\u2019s also the opportunity to snorkel over the reef and to swim in a beautiful lagoon. (Tequila provided!) We had a wonderful holiday at this hotel but we won\u2019t go back for two reasons: firstly the animals that roam the resort are a real pain; they steal anything that is left on the table, even if you have just put your drink down for a few moments! Their hearing is acute too. I was in our room, rustled a packet whilst trying to open it and they shot out of the shrubbery, jumped onto the wall and stuck their noses under the railings. Shutting the patio door quickly was the only thing that actually stopped them from coming any further. Take insect repellent too - there are lots of biters out there! Secondly, we like to be right on the beach and whilst the beach is readily accessible and an easy walk or buggy ride during the day, it\u2019s not so easy at night; particularly as we travel with a friend who cannot walk any great distances.

Had been to sister hotel, Riu Yucatan, at Easter and was so impressed with service, location, facilities that decided to revisit in October. Decided on Tequila as we thought food was better and we were not dissapointed. Our experience of All Inclusive catering is that it is generally good but you have to remember that it is produced on a large scale which has some impact in quality and consistency. We thought Riu Tequila food was a step above all our previous expereinces and that the management and staff made every effort to go the extra mile with quaity and extra touchs that made dining a delight. Of specific note were the pasta bar and blue cheese. Only downside was the morning coffee (I'm very picky about coffee and it didn't quite do it for me) and butter (but I'm not that keen on any non-European butter/marg We were particularly impressed with the Halloween evening were food items had been prepared or re-presented with a spooky halloween feel. The whole dining room had been decorated with a Halloween theme which was humerous and imaganitive albeit somewhat dark - I think Mexicans have a different approach to Halloween. During our stay we were hit by Hurricaine Rina which was Cat 1 and lasted about 24 hours. We were hugely impressed by the hotels orgainisation and communication during this period. The storm did some damage to trees etc.. and there were leaves/branches everywhere in the morning but by lunchtime the hotel was nigh on 100% back to full function as if nothing had happened.

Optics in the room as well as the free minibar - what more could you ask for. The general setting of the hotel is just idyllic, set in a rain forest. There are racoon type animals which wonder around the hotel grounds, they are the size of small dog and are so amusing. Again some people have said they were a pest but we found them adorable, they are so gentle and you couldn't resist feeding them. There are also a few quite large lizards who seem to pose to have their pictures taken. The entertainers work very hard and the costumes for some of the shows were fabulous. No need to get up at the crack of dawn for sunbeds as there were loads, lots of shade (which we needed), we found beds round the pool at 10.30am no problems but we did tend to go to the beach a lot.

Also the first time we have been all-inclusive and have to say that I think we easily got our money's worth. My husband and I travelled 23 Sept for 2 weeks, stayed in a standard room, easily enough space and facilities for 2 of us. Hotel is nicely spread out so you don't get the feeling of being hundreds of people around. We never actually spent a day at the pool, preferring to walk down to the beach where there were plenty of loungers in the shade of palm treees or out on the beach close to the water. We did use the swim-up bar on the way back from the beach late afternoon time just for a cocktail but preferred the beach. Very clean. Lots of variety drinks wise, premium brands as well as local versions, and a fantastic cocktail selection. If a drink wasn't on the menu it didn't matter you only had to ask, even to the point that I just sometimes pointed at something someone else was having because I liked the look of it! Restaurants were good, lots of variety in the buffet restaurant, and that would be my only complaint (not even really a complaint) but after 2 weeks the constantly getting up and down for each course got a bit wearing as people were constantly up and down from tables. It was nice to go to the Lupita steakhouse for a change to have dinner served. We went 3 times, and also to Bamboo the asian restaurant twice (buffet also) just for a change. Never had a problem getting booked for the later sitting at 8.45/9pm. We certainly didn't get up at 7am to go and book, but if we went for breakfast around 8.30am and there were still tables available then we booked. Lots of trips available in the area, through Thomsons or the guys on the beach, and I think from the plaza too. We only did 1 which was a catamaran trip to Isla Mujeres.

Pool area was great but not sure I'd want to fight for a sun bed when the hotel is busy. Beach lovely and clean and just a 2 minute walk to get a drink when needed.Bar service was excellent and the entertainment team worked very hard and put on some great shows. There was great choice in the main restuarant in the evenings but as usual with this sort of buffet style catering we'd had enough by the end - would say though that generally better than the buffet on a P&O cruise last year. A real disappointment were the 3 themed restaurants. I was expecting these to be a la carte - so was looking forward to a break from the buffet. However the Steak House is fixed starter and desert and a choice of 5 main courses which are served to the table - steaks good but veg etc nothing to be proud of. The Asian restaurant is buffet style and as there were a number of Asian themed evenings in the main restaurant a bit pointless and food not very good and not all dishes listed available anyway. Please avoid the Mexican restaurant - the only time I was ill all holiday!! Food again buffet style for starters with just the main course ordered at the table. If you are going to eat at one of these places - book for first sitting as on 2 occassions when we booked for second sitting we felt rushed out and the quality was less than that experienced during 1st sitting. Finally if you have teenagers with you - we did - there is absolutely no consideration for their needs in terms of entertainment - very disappointing as the excellent teen club was a real highlight of our cruise last year. I would go back to mexico but not at this time of year - felt information about the weather from First Choice was misleading and no warnings in any health information about the horrendous mosquitos. Possibly would return to this hotel but would need to investigate other providers who might cater more for teens.", "Date": "October 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Yarm, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cThe Usual Riu Refinements!\u201d", "Author": "PeterBean", "ReviewID": "UR119667735", "Content": "We stayed here for 14 nights in October 2011. The hotel grounds are very picturesque. The \u2018jungle feel\u2019 to the place is excellent and the grounds are very large. There are many facilities spread over the grounds and the large amount of space is used wisely. It doesn\u2019t feel overcrowded at all. Our room was just about the furthest away from the reception area, at what I would estimate was a 4 minute walk. A very pleasant walk before breakfast or after dinner on an evening. The grounds are very clean and well kept by gardeners. Plenty of wildlife to enjoy aswell. The rooms are spacious if a little dated. No problem for us as we like to be up and about. It served the purpose though although it wasn\u2019t what I would consider 5 star accommodation. Always very clean though and the room was made up to an excellent standard every day and thoroughly cleaned. Possibly the cleanest hotel room I have had whilst abroad. The food was as per the usual Riu standard; excellent. Plenty of choice at any time of the day. The themed restaurants were varied. We loved the steak house, the Asian restaurant was a nice change but the Mexican restaurant was very poor. It feels like the buffet food being plated up from next door and brought over. Difficult at times to book the restaurants. If you don\u2019t book at 7am, you won\u2019t get into the steak house which is a shame. The two seatings are at odd times aswell, and as it isn\u2019t staggered, it leads to queues and considerable waits for food. The drinks were very good. The bar staff were all very friendly and will make any cocktail you can think of. Generous measures and quick refills. The bars stay open until late and you are always greeted with a smile. The location is good. We enjoyed that walk (or circa \u00a32.75) in a taxi to the local town. A little seedy in places but we felt safe and had a good time both morning and evening. The beach was, as I\u2019m sure you can glean for these reviews, a short walk from the hotel. I would say around 10 minutes. There is the shuttle bus which runs every 5 minutes but we preferred the walk and once you have sat and waited, you could have walked down. A consideration for anybody with a walking issue though! The pool; didn\u2019t really spend any time there with the lovely beach just a stone\u2019s throw away. I will say one thing; it seemed to be very popular with the Brits and American \u2018all-dayers\u2019 who could be seen there morning, noon and night enjoying the swim-up bar. You are on holiday and want to relax but the rowdiness got old fast. Surprisingly, it isn\u2019t even then young ones; it\u2019s the families and older groups who have had a good drink by lunch time. No problems though, the beach is a lot quieter. The staff are generally very good. They are helpful and work hard to get the job done and provide a good service. The negatives I can think of are the \u2018tour\u2019 around the Thomson Platinum hotel over the road. Almost like a \u2018what you could have won\u2019 or \u2018how the other half live\u2019. I understand that it\u2019s a pitch to sell you the better (and more expensive) hotel next year but a guided tour is cringe worthy for both parties in my opinion. Also, the cleaners start at 8am every morning. Don\u2019t expect a lie-in here. They do a great job, but at the cost of waking everyone up early. Was a problem at times when we wanted to relax but worse things could have happened. All in all, typical Riu service. Good accommodation for reasonable money. Easily accessible though the big travel providers as a package, emphasized by the number of people that got dropped here from our flight from our UK airport (full coach load).

Had a fantastic time. Did have 4 days of heavy!!!! rain, but it is the rainy season!!! The Rooms. We had a ground floor room. Whilst I would say it was clean our housekeeper didn't really go overboard as some other guests have said. The Coati's (wild animals) decided to use our patio as a toilet one night. I actually cleaned it up but the marks were still on the patio 6 days later. I also stamped on a cockroach one day and the remnants were still there at the end of the holiday. So the floors were obviously not swept or mopped for 8 days!! Having said that the room was spacious. Clean bedding daily The liquor dispenser was lovely late afternoon when you had enough of sun and inbetween getting ready for the evening. The Bars. Brilliant! Never waited longer than 2 mins for a drink. Cruz and Ros at the pool bar were lovely and were on the ball re filling drinks before you had finished the last. And they were always smiling. The Food Again fantastic. We didn't go to the themed restaurants as not up early enough to book. But the food in the main buffet was great. They had everything there. Occasional theme night. Quality was excellent. To be honest I was a little sick of food towards the end of the holiday. Not because it wasn't good just I had truely had enough over the 2 weeks. No complaints. The Beach Beautiful. Although not directly on site (didn't bother us as we are pool people) It is only a 5 minute walk across the road via a walkway. It's a lovely walk after breakfast and you get to use all the sister hotels amenities so no need to return to the tequila until you are ready. There is a buggy if you are feeling lazy. Reps Good knowlegable and friendly. Trips Sian Kaan monster truck and speedboat in one trip. Saw wild dolphins and sea turtles but it is expensive for what you get. Captain Hook night.

But I will list my pros and cons for Tequila. Pros: My room was perfect, I asked for a ground floor room near the Lobby as I knew I'd be going between 2 resorts.Everyday they'd leave 1 of those towels in the shape of an animal which was a nice little touch after they cleaned, had a fully stocked fridge everyday, a personal touch I liked was the stocked liquor dispenser in the room ( 4 bottles ) The pool was a nice size and was clean , was easy getting servered at the swim up bar it wasn't to crowded and when I was there they had 2 people working it. Bars: I pretty much went to all the bars over my stay, I never had a hard time getting servered.I wished I remembered some of the names as I was always well taken care of.Now don't get me wrong I did tip a little bit but nothing crazy. Restaurants : I went to the buffet a couple times while I was there, never had any problems finding food I liked, the sports bar/ snack bar was good for hambugers and stuff at night ( can't remember everything ) over-all was good food I found. Staff: I found all the staff to be very friendly and helpful if you had a problem, I had forgot to tell them I had to cut my resort bracelet for the wedding and I had no issues getting a new 1 when I came back pretty late with no proof I was a guest other then a key. Cons: Although I knew there was no beach attached to the resort I think the little shuttle they had ended pretty early and if you missed it after a long day it was a long walk to change ( more so a problem for me being at the Playacar for meals with my friends ) My room was great over-all clean etc, but they started to do reno's in the building I was in about 2 days before I was set to leave, by the looks to it whenever someone checked out they started... which was annoying for the fact they started work early in the morning but it was only 2 days so not to bad.Would've liked a call or something to warn me. Other then those 2 problems I found it over-all to be a great place when I stayed there in April of 2009 Now to be fair I didn't spend all my time at this resort but that's the bonus to staying at the RIu's as you could go to I think was 4 of them total, which I did check them all out which was a nice little change.", "Date": "October 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cgreat time\u201d", "Author": "grm2445", "ReviewID": "UR119627522", "Content": "this hotel is really good, the buffet is fresh and has alot of choice, the restaurants are good the mexican the food is not bad but the steak house is best, the asian restaurant is good but can be hit and miss, the staff are exellent the rooms are large and clean. the bars serve some premuim brands and the bar staff are fast and friendly,over all value for money", "Date": "October 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Shropshire", "Title": "\u201cBrilliant Holiday\u201d", "Author": "Barbara H", "ReviewID": "UR119620674", "Content": "We recently returned (12 October) from Rui Tequila, Playa car and had a fantastic holiday with only one day of rain.

Our room faced the boundary fence of the hotel and was located at the far end of the complex, but we enjoyed the quietness, watching the wild animals and birds each day. The room was of a good standard and we were very happy with the cleaning staff, We were impressed with all the staff working at the hotel and the animation team, but found some of the bar staff not so friendly especially in the Sports bar. We booked our trips with the local travel agent found five minutes away at the local shops, the prices are half the Thompson prices, remember to barter with them too as they will come down on the prices quoted. Dollars are accepted outside the hotel, but you are often charged more in dollars then if paying with Mexican pesos, especially using taxis. We didn\u2019t use the pools and they were very crowded and full of people getting drunk all day, the beach was beautiful with plenty of shade and you can use the Yacutan and Playacar hotels for drinks/lunch/icecreams. The cheapest way to get to Tulum or Cancun is on the collectivo mini-van, catch a taxi to Playa del Carmen 75 pesos to the Collectivo Stand in town, check if he\u2019s going to Tulum and the cost, we paid 35 pesos each, You pay when you get off, they stop on the cross roads opposite the entrance to the car park/coach entrance, you need to cross the dual carriageway. The site entrance fee to the ruins is 51 pesos. There is a nice beach on the site which you can use. Returning the cellectivo stand is at the bottom of the road near the crossroads, the vans are clearly labelled colectivo.

Thankfully, not much had changed and the hotel was run to the same high standard as before. All the staff from reception and restaurants through to the cleaners were very friendly and always said 'Hola!' Our room was clean and tidy and easily big enough for what we needed. The only slight negative about the room was that they insist on using these plasticy matress protectors which sound like you are sleeping on a paper bag. That aside, they were comfortable enough to sleep on. Our room was backward facing which turned out fine as it seemed a bit quieter than facing the pool. The beach was lovely and seemed bigger than when we last went. Plenty of sun and shade for when it got a bit too hot. The food was good, plenty of choice although some nights didn't seem to have as much as others which was a bit disappointing but we always had enough to eat. Breakfast was good and everything was nice and fresh. When we were down at the beach, the beach club where lunch was available seemed to have very poor choice and we found oursleves having to come back up to the hotel to have lunch. During the holiday we were invited to a special meal to thank frequent visitors to RIU hotels for their loyalty. This was a nice touch and they provided a live Mariachi band and a completely different menu for the meal. We felt quite impressed that they recognise returning customers. There were plenty of animals around which are so friendly and quite amusing to watch. The pools are nice with plenty of space around to relax. Over the last few days we had a LOT of rain which can't be helped at this time of year and to be fair to the hotel staff, they put on entertainment indoors to try and keep people amused. We did pop into Playa Del Carmen for a look around and it is only a five minute taxi ride away. Be aware that despite the Thomson rep saying the shopkeepers don't hassle you, they do. Whilst we still felt safe there, it did start to get annoying after a very short time, especially when two of the shop workers asked if we wanted to buy drugs!!

There is a sports bar that is open 24 hours and has the 24 hour snack bar inside there. there are fridges with fruit plates and hot dogs hamburgers and sandwiches. We thought this was pretty cool. Every night before the adult show they did the kids mini disco where all the kids were invited on stage to play games and win prizes. The staff from the mini club usually did the games with them. My daughter loved it! for one show the kids practiced a few dances from grease and put a show on for the adults. very cute. The entertainment after kids club was very good. the drinks were all very yummy and they were very generous with the amount of alchol they put in. It did seem though at times that they didnt have enough staff to work the bars. One or 2 for a huge bar full of people. But they worked very hard to try and keep up and be quick. When the 2 girls were working the pool bar your drink was always refilled before you were done. They were awesome! The rooms were very nice. I loved how the bathroom are was so big! the only down side was the plastic they had under the sheets. very noisy and uncomfortable. I had also asked to not be on a bottom floor but was put there anyways. Also asked for a kings sized bed and it was 2 doubles put together. My daughter saw the parasailing and wanted to do that. so on our last day we went to the scuba stand on site by the pool and booked it. The guy at the stand was very nice booked our times. We went down to the beach at the time we were supose to go and they got us all ready to go. They said they were taking us to the boat by seadoo and gave us life jackets. The only life jacket they had for my daughter who weighs less than 50lbs a adult large. They also had us jump on the back of the seadoo without instructions, we've never been on one before and he just takes off full speed. My daughter was almost crying at this point. He zig zagged around for a while then found the boat and sped up along side it while the boat is going full speed and wanted us to get off. so hes hanging onto the boat and one of the guys on the boat had me pass him my daughter and he put her in the boat then he lifted me and put me in. My kid at this point was balling. She was so scared. Then they get another couple get on the seadoo while the boat is still going. Another woman in the boat looked at me horrifed and said she couldnt belive they did that and that she is not leaving the boat that way. I let the guys running the boat know that we will not be leaving the boat that way, and they did stop the boat to take us back. I was very dissapointed that somthing that cost us so much money and was supose to be fun was ruined by how insainley dangerous just getting to the boat was. SO all in all I would not reccomend the parasailing tour through the company on the hotel grounds. there are other companys that go around the beach and offer but not sure how diffrent they would be.", "Date": "October 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cBrilliant\u201d", "Author": "MissMariaC", "ReviewID": "UR119414369", "Content": "Booked Riu Tequila for the affordable price, great reviews.. so glad that I did, no disappointment! Mexico has always been a must-visit destination.. picture perfect sandy beach, scorching sun, 30+\u00b0.. PARADISO! The service the staff provide is absolutely brilliant. From receptionists, to the kitchen staff.. from the bartenders to the entertainment team.. everyone was very pleasant. Restaurant offers a variety to suit everyones taste. Im a vegetarian myself and always found something to my taste. If its octopus and quesadillas you want, or a plain burger and chips.. its all there. Room blocks are spaced out around the pool area with the pool bar and pool buffet in the middle. The whole area is surrounded by various tropical trees, giving a sort-of rainforest feel. Rooms are well maintained, no problems whatsoever. Was quite a surprise to see a minibar in the room.. not a heavy drinker myself, but was nice to have a tequila and coke after a shower. The entertainment during the day was pretty much repetitive, but every night the team did a great job with a different production. Although not to everyones taste, the team performed shows such as Mama Mia, Grease, Moulin Rouge, the Rocky Horror show.. a lot of cheese involved, but we still managed to enjoy ourselves. Highlight is the beach. White sand, transparent water, palm trees.. what else to ask for? To get to the beach its 800 meters, about 10 minute walk. No trouble, kept us fit after all the buffet has to offer. The beach is shared with all the other hotels in Playacar resort, but never felt crowded. You can walk along the shore to the end of the beach and you'll find absolute paradise. Mother nature at its best! There were areas fenced off to guard the eggs that the turtles have buried... wondered down a few times to see if I could spot any turtles, but unfortunately didn't. Overall, a brilliant stay. Minor disadvantage is that the hotel is not directly on the beach, but thats wasn't a problem at all!

Front desk staff at check in/out and throughout friendly and helpful. The bar staff were nearly all brilliant bar 1 young guy in the sports bar who made an issue of our group pushing 2 tables together and was rude and ignored us if we didn`t return the glasses back to the bar when ordering the next round of drinks. Miguel and Hector both run the bars well and were very helpful when i asked for chilli tequila(wow holy s**t it`s hot) which is normally just for tasters on mexican night. The maids and groundstaff kept the place spotless at all times even when it hammered down with rain/wind they continued cleaning. The entertainment staff require a huge wage rise as these guys were outstanding from sunrise till after showtime. The speciality restaurants we tried weren`t great.....steakhouse ribs were tough as leather and the starter was cold. The asian was tasteless and food less than luke warm. We spoke to others on holiday and the reports about both these speciality eateries were very mixed from brilliant to rubbish.Last year at the Riu Cancun i found the speciality restaurants to be good but in my opinion not so good at Riu Tequila. The buffet retaurant and the lunch lupita buffet was great and we both loved eating there. The pool bar was brilliant and the games we took part in good fun. The rooms were spotless and air con and ceiling fan worked well. We couldn`t sit on the balcony because it was looking onto a perimeter fence and got no sun at anytime of day. We did the all inclusive day trip to Xplor with Thomsons and had fun flying around on zip lines,driving amphibious vehicles and swimming and rafting in the caves. We also did a day trip to Cozumel independently which was good and we did the monday night bar crawl with Thomsons to 2 bars which was good and then onto coco bongos in playa del carmen which was so cramped in on the top floor with no waiter service i thought they were having a laugh and some of our party left as we couldn`t see the show and felt unsafe.

POOL.. poolwas great plenty of shade or sun depending on what u wanted ( which for me was shade on week 2 as i cooked on week 1 lol) . pool bar was cool friendly staff although drinks were a tad weak. you get fresh clean towels every day and they were warm and fluffy every morning. SERVICE.. the staff here are so helpful its incredible nothing is too much trouble , the place is constantly being cleaned and the cleaners work their butts off . the entertainment was pretty boring but i guess it would be ok for the older generation it was generally cabaret stuff which we arent into but some would like it ,its a matter of taste. reception staff were good our fridge broke down but problem was dealt with quickly . we did ask for an ashtray once which we never got but not a big problem. FOOD.. if you cant find something to eat here then u must have already died of starvation lol. the main restaraunt was packed with more food than ive ever seen in my life and catered for everyone. the steakhouse wassnt great , the steak itself was good but no choice of what you get with it but the baked alaska was great (good job as its what u got regardless) . the mexican which was the beach club by day was crap , the food wasnt bad but we needed to eat again at the main restaurant an hour later as the 3 courses filled neither me or my wife. my advice is if you book anyone of the 3 special restaurants (book early around 7-8 am) book the asain bamboo . it was amazing , it was a buffet choice and all the food was tasty and brill and u must have the fried icecream there, its gorgeous . BEACH.. the beach is at it looks in the pictures, utterly amazing, the beach was clean plenty of beds and the sea was, well, ive never seen a clearer bluer sea in my life , we swam in it loads and you could see the bottom even far out , u have to go and see the beach for yourself to truly appreciate it. a bonus was having the use of the yucatans pool which is right on the beach to dip in , and free all inc drinks in the beach club . its only a 5 min walk but if its too hot just get the buggy from the reception it takes 2 mins but please tip him he only gets tips for his living because he does not actually work for the hotel. REPS.. there are 2 english reps in the hotel and they are both great . they both helped us tremendously and we booked a couple of trips with them (ill get to them later) . if you do go here ive been asked if people who go here can bring some maltesers for the rep emma ,shes missing them lol, she will love you forit!! TRIPS.. one of the main reasons we came here was my wifes life long wish to swim with dolphins and we done the royal swim at the dolphin discovery centre . we both loved it so much my wife did another more extensive swim but this turned out to be at another place and for 130 quid she wasnt overly pleased . be aware if u want photos of the day they arent cheap but we got the full package because its my wifes dream and they were good quality . but while she did her second swim i went on my dream trip which i booked with emma the rep for \u00a375 . i went on the coba mayan village day . now this awesome deffo worth every penny . even the coach trip was great as they showed some great documentaries and sebastien the guide was very knowledgable . visited the mayan tribespeople and it was quite humbling to see how they lived , then a mile trek in the jungle which was special . then on to coba ruins . now this was awesome , too much to write about but BE fit coz if you can climb the 120 steps of the main ruin ,and get back down again u will have have lost a stone in sweat!!

Fabulous hotel set amongst lot of trees and greenery. Two big pools, lots of sunbeds in little bays, not just all in a straight line, and plenty of shade for those who need it, me included. Lots of little creatures to feed, Coatimundi, like little racoons. Food in the main buffet restaurant was excellent quality and tons of choice. One night the chef came round and asked if there was anything we wanted that we hadn't seen on offer. My husband asked for mashed potato with the evening meal, and it was there the next night (isn't he refined!) The speciality restaurants - the Steak House was good, but the Mexican was poor. The rooms were lovely, two large beds, nice bathroom and electronic safe which was free! Cleaning Service was brilliant and we had towel sculptures left every day. Entertainment team were very good round the pool, at the beach and in the evening. The costumes for the shows were gorgeous, most shows were good. Bar staff were very accommodating. The beach was over the road through the Riu Yucatan hotel, there is a golf buggy service (about every 10 mins). Lovely beach and blue sea, plenty of sunbeds and also lots of shade for those who want it. Trips through the reps were expensive. We booked up through the little kiosk, turn left out of the hotel and just a few minutes up the road, along with a few shops and at the back pay phones for calling back home (bought phone cards from the rep). If the mozzies like you then you will need to take some spray. We got some of the swap box near the rep's desk (this is where people leave their half used bottles of sun cream, shampoo and anything else they didn't want to take home - what a brill idea!)

They make it sound like they are working for your tour operator but THEY ARE NOT!!! They take your bags to your coach and then stand there waiting for money from you, they will take sterling and the amount of people that we watched having to give out money was unbelieveable. Anyway onto the hotel, arrived at reception no problems, we had 2 rooms booked and we were situated next to each other. (1301/1302) The rooms were on the lower floor of a block of 8 rooms. In the rooms you can hear everything, next door, up above, and even though they ask for you to be silent after 11pm(it doesnt happen) you can hear everyone coming in. Both rooms were much the same as everyone describes on here and I can see why people get frustrated if you were given a room that was a little dated - even though this wasn't the case for us you would be disappointed if it happened. They are painting rooms at the moment and the out buildings around the hotel were being done as we were there so they are trying to bring the hotel up to date. We found the buffet restaurant great for breakfast - you can't ask for a wider range (just watch out for people pushing in whilst your queueing for food!!!). We only used the A La Carte once and that was the Asian one and it was a little disappointing and it wasn't very busy though we did choose the earlier sitting (1845 & 2045) Food at night was great again only gripe a little repetitive, (pizza, Pasta, Carvery etc you name it and its there!! all themed too!!) Again beware of where your seated, sometimes they just put you anywhere not where you want to be but where they want you!!! Several areas were closed off in the morning. The pools were clean and we found the pool bar here on the first day to be very loud and full of young people. (18-25) and were talking very loud throwing drinks from the swim up bar into the pool we therefore decided to go across to the Riu Yucutan across the road which backs onto the beach, we saw as the week went on that most people with families or older couples also did this, infact we went there to watch there evening entertainment too!! The theatre at the yucutan was much more comfortable not as busy and certainly not as warm. Staff worked extremely hard and you only had to ask for something and it was done or a drink was poured. The entertainment in both hotels was great just that we preferred the setting at the Yucutan.

There are so many things to talk about this hotel (pretty much all good); the thing that stood out for me was the entertainment. The entertainment staff were absolutely brilliant, there were plenty of games to do during the day and at night the shows were always brilliant. Much better than the entertainment in Egypt, in Egypt about 20 people turned up to the show and in the Riu there must have been a good 200! The food is of a good standard but it does get repetitive and we both thought the Asian Restaurant was a bit iffy; the 1st time we went we didn't really enjoy it and the 2nd time the food was much better but I had quite a bad stomach ache afterwards (may just be coincidence). The Steakhouse was very nice, we must have gone there over 5 times and this is only restaurant I would recommend (other than the main restaurant). They did also have a Mexican but as that was located at another hotel and we didn't quite fancy the menu we didn't bother with that one. The location of the hotel is great, it's in a resort called Playacar which is a private estate as it were and is very secure; they have people on the gates who only let in certain taxis and coaches,etc. This makes the surroundings quite nice and quiet but you're never too far from the city or other attractions. The beach is about a 10 minute walk away or if you're feeling lazy you can get a shuttle buggy there. The staff were wonderful, always helpful friendly and had a good sense of humour. The housekeeping even put balloons and a happy birthday message in our for my wife's birthday and when we went to the steakhouse for her birthday they sang to her and gave her a big chocolate cake. Two members of the entertainment staff we really enjoyed interacting with were Miguel (aka Mike) and Elias, they were both great! Also when we were there, there was a guy called Orlando; if you can avoid him as there were quite a few complaints about him (we made one) as he was a nice guy at times but he was very cocky and a bit of a pranker that too things too far sometimes. The grounds of the hotel are lovely, it's like a little forest with some wonderful and interesting wildlife; especially the coatis which are from the racoon family and are always out and about. They can be annoying sometimes but they easily scared off. The swimming pool was lovely and was always a welcome relief on days where it was easily over 30. We did 3 trips while we were there: Chichen Itza: Definitely recommend it for those interested in culture and history. Does take quite some time to get there though Swimming with Dolphins: Did this for my wife's birthday, didn't think I'd enjoy it because that's not really my thing but we both loved it. Amazing experience Xplor: This is an adventure park with rafts, river swim, ziplines and driving through caves and forest. The ziplines and driving were fantastic! All in all the holiday was absolutely brilliant, the only downside was the food really but we still enjoyed what we ate but just it wasn't the same every day (which it pretty much was).

I can honestly say that the accomodation, food, service and cleanliness of this hotel was excellent. We spent two weeks from 19th Sept to 3rd October and the weather was absolutely fab. We had one morning of rain and the hotel catered for this by setting up casino tables, coffee making and animal towel demonstrations and organised playtime for any children that were there. Absolutely nothing was too much trouble for the staff we met up with some couples whilst we were there and on one night we booked into the asian speciality resturant for the evening meal and as it was one of the girls birthday they had arranged the tables and decorated them with balloons and banners it was great. We had no problems getting into any of the speciality resturants and they were all excellent. The steak house seemed to be the most popular and the places did seem to go quicker than the other two but provided you were up by 7am to book your place then there didnt seem to be a problem. We didnt spend much time by the pool area as we prefer the beach so I cant comment on this in particular, but the walk down to the beach was literally only 5 mins under a shaded walkway or if you were really lazy you could wait for the buggy to take you down but with all the food on offer sometimes this was the only exercise you had. The food in the buffet resturant was of extremely high standard and plenty of choice catering for all tastes. The cleanlness of the hotel, rooms and ground was exceptional. All the staff work extremely hard and are constantly smiling and saying hola to everyone they meet. We stayed in room 1612 which was towards the back of the hotel, and we heard no noise from any of the bars or disco which was open until 2am. I specifically requested a top floor room and was given one. Your room has optics and a mini fridge filled with beer and soft drinks which is topped up every two days and there is an ice machine in each block of rooms. The beach is fab, soft sand and turquoise blue sea plenty of sun beds and if you want you can use the other riu hotel which is the Yucatan for any drinks or food. During the night, the entertainment team put on different shows every night and they were highly entertaining. Alot of the clients from the Yucatan were coming to the Tequilla and saying that the Tequilla had a much better atmosphere. All I can say is that anyone who goes to this hotel will not be disappointed unless you have really bad weather I cannot fail to see what there is to complain about. We went on two trips one to Chitzen Itcha and we went on the catarmaran boat trip both of which were great. The Chitzen Itcha trip is a long day mind you and if it is very hot it can be draining. We also went on the night out to Coco Bongos which was highly enjoyable. All in all I can honestly say that we had nothing to complain about and would definately go back again.", "Date": "October 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Edmonton", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Value\u201d", "Author": "rc7219", "ReviewID": "UR119085538", "Content": "This place is amazing specially when you are traveling with kids.

Stayed 19th sept for two weeks travelling with my mum. Hotel: lovely grounds, wildlife consists of racoon type creatures, small solitary rotent/small dear type animals and birds also several butterflies, lizzards and a couple of bats too! Room was nice, slight fusty smell but i've experienced in each carribean holiday, also safe provided free of charge. Only one downside if you want tea/coffee then there is no kettle. Towels - you get a card and just exchange must must loose either or there is a charge! Pools: Beds a bit sparce if you didn't get there before 9.30, you snooze you loose basically. Pools nice, just a bit noisy if large families/groups about. Didn't experience any floating sun cream or scum in water but I only used pool for 3 days. Food: Main buffet could not fault, think you'd be hard pushed to complain or not find anything you like. I found the food in the lunch buffet at the pool restaurant superior to that of the beach club located at the Yucutan on the beach although i mainly ate at beach club due to the beach location. Only issue would be the three wines served taste like vinegar and you cannot get a liquer and mixer in the main dining room only soft drinks, water and wines are served unless you take in your own from the theatre bars. Asian restaurant - Very nice booked twice although take a light cardie as it was a little cool. Steak house - Ok, One of the steaks was a bit tough. There is a bar there though! Mexican served at Yucatian beach club - Ok, food tasty but they didn't explain what you had to do e.g. get your own starters etc There are not any ala carte restaurants at this hotel as such, although the Steak House is a set menu and choice of mains. Beach: Beach fab, not much too see snorkelling wies at the beach in front of the riu's. I used Scuba Caribe to Scuba Dive, Juan my guide was great! Area: Playacar is a nice, safe gated area. Few vendors on beach didn't really cause any hassle. Riu hotel chain has the monoply here. Both palaces look nice but cannot get inside the grounds, visited Yucutan and walked around, only saw lobby of Riu Playacar and Lupita. There are a few stalls and vendors selling trips out etc if you go left out the entrance, although Playa Del Carmen was fractionally cheaper due to competition. PDC is also nice, very safe. Trips: Coba was fab, saw a Mayan village too. Also FATCAT 1/2 day catermarang is good, saw turtles and many aother fish. Booking trips through your tour rep is very expensive, I recall FATCAT was about \u00a350 and the coba trip around \u00a380. Try use a vendor once you arrive, ask around for a reputable one once you arrive or try go to places yourself using busu etc in central PDC station. i would do this is I go again instaed of paying F/Choice prices like we did. I think my review is fair and I would return. I don't feel I was mislead from the research and did not expect 5* treatment, we have too remember there are now 6, 7 and 8* hotels in existence! I think thomson only rate as 4T's. If you want to ask anything please do, best holiday I've had!

We don't normally write reviews, but think it's important to be honest and help other travellers make informed choices. Overall we had a great holiday, so relaxing, just what we wanted. I wouldn't say this was a 5 star hotel, however it was excellent value for money and the staff were so friendly and helpful. We just wanted to pass on a few hints and tips as well as express some issues. AIRPORT - took us one and a half hours to clear immigration and customs, queue after queue and then another 1hr 15 mins to the hotel, so be beware! ROOM - Comfortable and clean, yet very dated. We slept so well on holiday and didn't have a problem with plastic sheets on the beds! Towel animals left on a regular basis from the maid which was a lovely surprise! The only down side to the room was the awful damp smell, we had to wash everything we we got home, even our travel bags/camera case etc as the smell had penetrated everything. Very unpleasant. When you first walk into the room the smell hits you, but after a few minutes you get used to it. I think it's down to the humid climate and airconditioning (twhich wasn't great by the way!). However, we'd read this on Trip Advisor before we went, so it wasn't a surpise. The only other thing we would comment on is noisy, inconsiderate guests that slam doors in the early hours when they come back to their rooms.....why can't hotels fit some sort of door stopper that allows doors to be closed quietly!! RESTAURANTS - The main buffet was fantastic! Something for everyone, from freshly cooked pizza/pasta/Mexican dishes, to speciality evenings several times a week. My only criticism would be the lack of fresh fish, i thought there would have been a better choice. Steak restaurant - I don't know what all the fuss is about! Yes the steak was fantastic, but the other courses were just OK, but very rushed. No sooner do you put your knife and fork down and the next course is served! We ate 5 courses in just over 1 hour...that's some going! Mexican restaurant - down on the beach front near the Yucatan hotel. Lovely meal, however as the restaurant is outside and there's no air conditioning, the humidity was unbearable and spoilt the evening. The ceiling fan where we sat was broken too, so that made it even worse! Asian restaurant - This was a great meal, fantastic for sushi lovers! Plently of choice for the main course and try the deep fried icecream, certainly a novelty! One word of warning for the restaurant....WEAR SOMETHING WARM! This was the only restaurant with A/C and it was so cold that people were sat in coats and I had to go back to the room for a cardigan! I have never eaten in such a cold room before, almost like sitting in a fridge, which in turn made the food go cold very quickly! Most guests seemed to queue to book for the speciality restaurants anywhere from 6.45am, this wasn't a problem for us becuase we were early risers anyway. Overall, I really don't think you can go wrong with the main buffet, something for everyone and you don't have to queue at 6.45am for a table - bonus!! POOLS - We only stayed by the pool for 1 hour and that was 1 hour too much! Very noisy and rowdy, people just drinking and being loud....but what do you expect from an all inclusive hotel though! Our only other concern was the cleanliness of the pool, as there didn't seem to be any toilets close by and guests seemed to sit and drink in the pool and not move! Do the maths yourself! BEACH - FANTASTIC! Beautiful white sand, crystal blue warm sea. Plenty of sunbeds at all times of the day and palm trees for shade. We thought the beach was a much better option than the pool and we used the facilities of the Yucatan which is right on the beach front. The luch buffet at the Yucatan is better in the main hotel rather than the beach front restaurant (more choice). We used the free kayaks and snorkels most days and there were always plenty to go round (you can use them for 1hr at a time which is more than enough). TRIPS - We usaually go with the Thomson organised trips, however, these were so expensive. So, turn left out of the hotel and walk 5 mins to the shopping Plaza, there you will find excurions at much cheaper prices. We went to Chichen Itza (\u00a376 for us both instead of \u00a3138 with Thomsons) and it was exactly the same day out. We were very well looked after, free drinks and snacks on the bus. Mind you, we needed them as it was a 13hr day! The only down side to visiting Chichen Itza is that it's such a long way and you actually only have approx two and a half hours there...but well worth it! Would we go back to the Riu Tequilla? No, but only because there as so many other beautiful places to experience. If you want great value for money, then you can't fault the Tequilla.

Nice property, activities for all ages. - Check-in: quick, receptionists professional and friendly - Room: stayed in building 11, room 1113 on the first floor. This room faces the jungle, many animals to see in early morning. In the evening the entertainment from next door property may be heard when on balcony, but no noise in the room when balcony door is closed. Mini-bar and fridge in room, hair dryer, iron and ironing board, umbrella, safe, plenty of towels and hangers. Two double beds pushed together, firm mattress, plastic mattress cover under the sheets makes lots of noise while turning, shower very slippery (place a towel on the shower floor), no bathtub, bathroom area separated from the bedroom by a curtain only) - Food: ok, nothing spectacular, but everyone should find something to eat, we only booked the Asian which was good, ask for fried ice-cream for dessert as that is the highlight of dining there. Do not worry if you don\u2019t get to eat at any of the specialty restaurants, as everything is available at the main buffet (we ate in Asian restaurant on Wednesday, on Friday there was an Asian themed night at the main buffet with the same choice of sushi and warm dishes) - Entertainment: fun, the Caribbean show was excellent, day activities fun as well, lots to choose from, ping-pong, horse-shoe, basketball, volleyball, water aerobics, cooking classes, bingo, kids club etc. The activities for current and next day are listed on a big whiteboard located in the lobby. - Beach: 5 min walk away from the hotel, you may also take a short golf cart shuttle for free, no need to come back to Tequila for lunch as you can eat at Yucatan, however, there is much more variety in the Tequila buffet - Grounds: very nice, lots of wild life (if you stay on the ground floor, try not to feed the animals from your balcony, they will climb on to your balcony and poop all over). All in all it was a good vacation. Would I stay at this property again? No, only because there is so many other options out there to explore. Would I recommend this hotel to a friend?

The staff are so helpful, the hotel is spotlessly clean, the food has the best variety I have ever experienced and we cant wait to go back. The rooms are spacious and are cleaned every day. Imelda was our maid and she is an expert at placing the towels on your bed and making them into different animals. It was our anniversary whilst we were there, and Imelda made our bed up with heart balloons and scattered red rose petals, with a pair of swans made out of towels. I took a travel kettle as I like lots of hot drinks in my room. The fridge is filled regularly with allsorts of cold drinks,but you have to go to the buffet restaurant if you need a hot drink, and it is a pretty good walk away. You are better off taking your own kettle. The steak restaurant was delicious! We had the waiters round our table singing to us, complete with guitar, complimentary champagne and we were made to feel very special that night.Clemente made me a rose out of tissues which was lovely. Also, on our 1st day there, I dislocated my shoulder. It was the 2nd time I did it, the 1st being in Bridlington on 1st September. It came out again so easily and I had to go to hospital to get it put back in. I did not dare move my arm for the whole of the holiday in case it came out again, as It was very expensive at the hospital. The next day, I had a letter in my room from the Hotel Management, along with a bottle of Tequila and a bowl of fruit. They couldnt do enough for me, bless them. The buffet restaurant has so much food to choose from, you really are spoilt for choice, along with an Asian restaurant which was top class food, there is a Mexican restaurant over at the Yucatan Hotel. Also, there are a few shop over at Yucatan which are not too expensive. There is a 'Plaza' near Tequila Hotel but I advise you not to buy anything from them, you can get the same things for less than half the price at '5th Avenue Mall'. This is 70 peso's in a taxi (\u00a33.50ish), and well worth the trip if you need to shop.You will save alot of money, plus there are alot more good shops there. We didnt go on any trips because of my arm being strapped up, but there is some fantastic trips from the Reps Andy and Emma at the Thomsons station. We have to go there again, as I want to visit Tulum, Cozumel, the parks and to swim with dolphins . The entertainment is not too bad, abit repetetive, but you can always go to the other RIU Hotels to see whatthey have on offer for a change. We watched all the important football matches in the Sports Bar, which is open all night, if you need it. Roni really looks after you in there. Beware of the animals that roam the complex all day and night. They are called 'Quatties' by the locals, they look like Limas. Take care of your bags at the pool, because they took one lady's bag from her sunbed and ran off into the woods with it. People feed them as they always seem to be roaming round looking for food. Even the tiny babies follow them, its so cute to watch. Despite my injury, we had a great holiday, met some lovely people, hello Maria and Sarah, Debby and Paul, Pauline and Steven, Audrey and Craig. It was lovely to meet you all. Definately take clothes that are loose, you will need them for the 2nd week.......

So if you like to feel like you are away in a foreign Mexican grand hacienda style place, this could be good for you...if you want sleek modern styles, this is not a good choice. Just wanted to add a few comments less commonly mentioned. Positives: I've had vacations in MX 5 times in this area at 4 or 5 star resorts and this was indeed very clean, rooms basic but spotless, food was consistently good, and food prep/cleanliness was outstanding (I did a main Kitchen tour and it was spotless, well designed, food prep handling and dish and utensil cleaning also outstanding. I used to Manage a small College kitchen and this was a dream kitchen and sanitized properly. I cannot comment on the other kitchens, but main dining you should have nothing to worry about. Beach was a little walk but stunning and great for swimming, kayaking and sailing everyday. Never a problem finding a chair at any time of day, although it was being enjoyed by many. Note that as it in an enclosed beachfront complex and we met likely 80% vacationers from Europe, and so there is some topless tanning, so just be aware if sensitive about your children. As for beach and dining, you can use one at Yucatan or Playcar Riu's....liked Yucatan a bit better as the beach dining there for noon was better/cleaner. Was ill for 12 hours with something I ate and only after eating at Playacar one lunch hour. Concern: Food handling was poor at that location (saw staff use fingers to wipe sides of bowls 2 times while I was getting food...a bit of a shock after seeing spotless food handling all other times at Riu Tequila and Yucatan locations). Also Playacar lunch both soda dispenser's went out and no sense of attention to quickly fix...just a nod to go to the bar outside the lunch area and ask them for a drink. Another positive for us was meeting people from all over and enjoying the cultural interaction. Only a few from Canada or USA that we met, but guessing 50% from the UK and 30% from rest of Europe (many from Holland, Belgium, Germany, some from Spain). We met some wonderful young couples from Belgium, UK, Holland and Spain. Very few families this week and most had younger children. If you have teens, they would likely prefer the other Riu locations closer to the beach. Also had a fun \"Disco\" night club that was good fun in the evening. Not big with usually 30-80 in at a time, but onsite and all included too. Big sports bar in the complex that was never very busy, really a big open room with some TV's, pool tables....not very cozy, but where you can pick up pre-packaged snacks 24 hours. Note: This was the big food disappointment at this resort, as apart from set meal hours, the food availability was very poor from this snack bar. Not So Positives/Concerns: Mentioned in a few reviews but shower in standard room IS a big danger. Marble floor that is just a bit awkward to get in and out of due to huge lip at entrance, so you have to lean in or out, causing you to tend to slip. They put a solid grab bar at the entrance as clearly they know this is a problem. My wife slipped and badly bruised her hip. We also put a hand towel on the shower floor after that which helped greatly. Also too many Coati (raccoon like creatures)...they are cute and seem pretty harmless, but they are fed by way too many. Come out of the snack bar after midnight, and they are waiting to acost you for some food, getting right under foot. Also overall staff was excellent including some wonderful resort activities staff, but odd one are simply perverts with nothing but suggestive talk, touching other female activities staff and being annoying at best. If in Canada they would be fired on the spot and charged with harassment. Tips: Get the room you want and ask for it if not happy. We were put in a room too close to the entrance with road/street noise, told nothing available but stated it would not do (I left Toronto to NOT hear road noise out my window) and minutes later a room was found...surprise! Two story complex, stayed in upper room and would not want to be in lower one. Did see resort activities staff jump over ground floor room balcony and enter to \"chat\" with room cleaning staff....I would not want that in my room, or have the Coati's on my porch begging for handouts! Rented a car in the lobby through Thrifty. They have Riu rental contract so felt more safe with them AND cheaper than Avis which is at the plaza 5 min down the street. You should be able to negotiate to 700 MX peso/per day with ALL insurances and Zero deductible....or about 55 USD. Went to Tulum and Akumal for the day, drove around Playa del Carmen and totally worth it. Gas is cheap in Mexico too, main highway is excellent, well marked, get a map and enjoy! (I love Coba!). Enjoyed a great evening meal in Akumal at La Buena Vida...see reviews on Akumal. Sitting under a palapa beach side, watching snorkelers in front of you...great food and service...it was steady, busy for good reason! Would I go to Riu Tequila again, likely but may opt for the Yucatan location simply as we are beach people and it is closer, and can use the Tequila location if we want.", "Date": "October 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel but not 5*\u201d", "Author": "Jenna Q", "ReviewID": "UR118785031", "Content": "The Riu Tequila was a lovely hotel but did not meet our expectations.

They all had towels on them for hours on end with no one returning to use them! We travelled as a couple and straight away our eyes lit up when we saw our hotel. The lobby was very spacious and clean with the most fantastic arrangement of flowers etc with a fountain to sit around. Our room was lovely, very clean and fully air conditioned and had everything we needed ie. hair dryer, iron/ironing board, mini bar, safe and optics with a selection of spirits. Maids were great, fresh towels always, and they would tidy up anything that was out of place too? Mini bar was stocked reguarly. The staff in the whole place were friendly, helpful, polite and always very busy, from the waiters, bar staff, maids, gardeners and maintenance people. The entertainment shows were a bit hit and miss with us personally but I think thats down to our taste? The team worked so hard and did everything from poolside activities, casino/games night to the actual show they put on in the evening. May have been nice to have a bar out of the way of the evening show for those that wanted a quiet chat/drink etc? Loved the hotel 'critters' and found them very amusing and you soon learnt when to and when not to feed them? We have never been anywhere where we felt so safe and secure and was not afraid to leave our stuff around with the fear of it disappearing. The beach was great and the sea was so warm too. The beach buggy is out of action for a couple of hours in the afternoon so if you don't want to take the short walk then catch it beforehand. We got the ferry to Cozumel and hired VW beetle convertable and drove round the island for the day which was great fun and so cheap to do! We had a day at Xcaret which we thought was on the expensive side but very enjoyable. We had a meal out in a steak house on 5th Avenue with friends we made and the food was fabulous! (Beware of all the extras ie. water, tequila aparatiffs etc which all add to the cost). You do get bugged by the locals trying to sell you their wares all of the time and to be honest it would put some people off. Just be polite, stand your ground and don't look them in the eye??

We stayed here for a week last week after touring round Mexico staying in smaller boutique hotels. Now we had a great holiday, but there were some things about this hotel which weren't great. The first thing that hit us was how busy it was, just a shock to the system we thought, but it really was just too busy. Walking down the main walkway could be compared to walking down a high street. But yes, we knew the size before we went so can\u2019t really complain. Rooms \u2013 Were big, bright and clean. Separate loo, mini bar, safe in the room were all plus points. It was kept clean by staff. However, the air conditioning was a bit rubbish and the room never seemed to be cool enough. Food \u2013 Fine. We tried all 3 restaurants, Mexican, Asian and Steakhouse. Mexican wasn\u2019t great but the food in the others was fantastic. Problem was, you had to queue from 7am to have a chance of booking a table. I was actually overtaken on my way there, it was just ridiculous. Arrived to a line of about 20 people at 7am\u2026.not how I want to spend my holiday. They really have to come up with a better system for this. Food in the main restaurant and at lunch was good. Yes there are birds etc flying through and this bothered some people, but can\u2019t really be avoided. The other little animals we loved, but try to give them fruit not pizza if feeding them! They are very gentle and hilarious to watch. Noise \u2013 Having said about the early bookings, we never slept past 6.30am as this hotel is just so so noisy. Cleaning and maintenance staff banging about from 6am. Now they work hard and I appreciate that, but the sound of a mop banging off our door is not the best start to the day. Next day it was chopping the trees outside our room. Next day it was mini bar staff. If you go\u2026take earplugs. The noise extends to the pools. It\u2019s not a relaxing holiday destination but if you like a lively holiday then you probably wouldn\u2019t mind. There are 2 pools. One where the activities take place and one with a swim up bar. We chose the activities one as there was some peace in between the games. The other one? Forget about it. Lots of groups who went to Mexico to get drunk set up at 10am and never left. Just found it a bit tacky. The beach however is lovely and is really just a short walk away. The buggy didn\u2019t work for half the time we were there but didn\u2019t bother us at all. For folks who need a helping hand however, the beach was probably off limits. The entertainment staff were great and never bugged you if you didn\u2019t want to join in and were great fun when you did. They work morning till night and put on some good shows. Again though, it was mobbed at night which was fine some nights, but others we just wanted to chill out with some cocktails and this hotel doesn\u2019t really facilitate this. So there were good and bad aspects. I personally wouldn\u2019t go back or recommend to friends, but this is just down to our preference of wanting to unwind and relax a bit on holiday as opposed to feeling like we\u2019re in a holiday camp for noisy Europeans!", "Date": "September 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "bournemouth", "Title": "\u201cVery good hotel\u201d", "Author": "hotansunny", "ReviewID": "UR118663137", "Content": "This hotel is very clean and the food is of a good standard, other reviews are accurate of this hotel The staff are very friendly.The sea was very rough for the first week but fine for the second.

To complain about the five-minute walk to the beach (look it up on the map) or the use of hard plastic glasses in the pool area (you want to walk barefoot on broken glass I guess) is just nonsense. We've just got back from a week here with Thomson for \u00a3844 each. It was tremendous value. And the Tequila looked like a nicer resort that the Yucatan on the beach. At least the pool area at the Tequila is better. Room The hotel was built just under 15 years ago and the beige decoration probably reflects that. But it's not tatty and there are booze optics in the room (gin, vodka, rum and tequila). The walls have a few scuff marks (but not 15 years worth) and the TV is an old style rather than a widescreen LCD but it all worked. You get two small double beds side by side, a safe and iron. Housekeeping makes scary animals out of towels to surprise you when you get back after a day at the pool. There's a complaint about humidity on here. Well, you're in Mexico and it's so humid outside that our beach clothes on the outside line didn't dry properly in 24 hours. Not really the hotel's fault. Food The main restaurant was excellent. I wonder what the people who called it \"bland\" actually ate. The main problem with a self-service buffet is that it can get samey over a week. This is not the fault of the restaurant but rather the tendency you have to try a bit of everything each night. The menu did change daily and there were extensive salads, vegetables, Mexican foods and other main meat and fish dishes. I did feel that there was a lack of seafood (calamari featured strongly) and the steak restaurant made a good change of location but was a bit limited in choice. But really, the choice and quality of the food surpassed my expectation. Drink It is tempting to say that the cocktails are watered down because for the first few days we drank a lot and didn't feel drunk. On the third day we asked for stronger drinks, got them, and it was a terrible mistake. I reckon they make the drinks with single measures deliberately to help you pace yourself with all-day unlimited drinking. The quality of the drinks varied depending on the bar. The Pina Coladas were good everywhere but the Mojitos in the main bar opposite the stage were undrinkable and flavourless. The main bar serves drinks in glass glasses. The pool bar in hard plastic ones during the day. One of the reviews here implies they serve drinks in flimsy disposable glasses. Not so. Animals The grounds are over-run at dusk by long-nose bears. These raccoon-style animals are not scared of humans and will swarm around you in packs if encouraged. You will also see timid R.O.U.S.s from a distance of about ten paces and a few underfed cats. There are signs telling you not to feed the animals. The English ignore them. We love friendly animals. Staff Without exception the staff here are great. The entertainment staff work hard running activities during the day and putting on shows until late at night. Most of the time they look like they are having a blast. Really impressive. Excursions Ok, not strictly part of the hotel but there are a few things to know. On your first day, you should go out of the hotel, turn left and walk about five minutes to a row of upmarket touristy shops and a Starbucks (there's also an ATM here if the hotel's is out of order). Here you will find two booths selling excursions with hotel pickups significantly cheaper than the ones you will buy directly off the reps in the resort. They are the same excursions to the same places. But cheaper. Five minutes away. Or do yourself a real favour and take the 30-minute walk into Playa del Carmen and the bus station (which is trivial to find on the main street). The buses are better than National Express coaches (they have wifi) and are a fraction of the cost compared to the tourist excursions. An example: the half-day trip to Tulum costs \u00a330 each in the resort. It cost us M$60 each way on the bus plus M$50 each way taxi from the bus station to the ruins plus M$50 entrance making a total of M$220, or \u00a311, each. That's about it.

The level of service, rooms and food quality is so much better than the European versions of All Inclusive due to the influence of the American guests. Why do we accept sub-standard in Europe? We had the usual queues and slow service at the airport with Thomsons both in the UK and Mexico. Plenty of room on the plane in standard class, as a long-haul flight, a waste of money to upgrade. Arrival in Mexico wasn't too bad and reasonably quick, just fill out the forms properly on the plane and the walk to the counter has boards to say the documents you need at each desk. Once cleared just ignore all the people hassling you saying Thomsons and walk past and out of the doors where you'll find the reps in full uniforms. Transfer was about an hour. Trips - We went with Thomsons to Chichen Itza, a long day but one worth doing. We also did the Underwater World which was fantastic. We went snorkling with the sea turtles, saw other marine life and the coral reef, then went snorkling in a Cenote, a proper well preserved one. It was a great half day, just take your towel, sandals and have your costume on. We also visited the bird sanctuary, just walk out of the hotel, past the starbucks and shops for about 20mins and its on the left at the end of the road where the roundabout for the town centre is. On a hot day get a taxi down but its ideal for families and we saw many birds and wildlife. Most people didn't even know the place was there. Also Xplore is just outside the Playacar village, I'm sure you'll get a cheap deal by visiting yourself, a taxi can't be much. You did feel very safe wandering around the Playacar village and in Puerto del Carmen. The hotel was spotless and like walking through the jungle with the birds and creatures to watch. The pool area was very busy from early morning however we prefer the beach where there were hundreds of free loungers and you can pop into the Riu Yucatan for drinks, snacks and lunch. Their hotel was equal to ours, however very busy during the day with Riu Tequila quests on top of their own. The Riu Playacar hotel was quite relaxing although a much smaller hotel and its facilities showed that. The food was all fresh, non of this microwaving and deep frying business and the cocktails were all made with fresh ingredients and made to order, properly in a blender, shaker etc. At the daytime bar ask Lorenzo for a Chocolate Martini, they really taste like chocolate! The booking restaurant proceedure was a pain and we found the Mexican and Chinese dissapointing compared to the main buffet. The Chinese food was nice for a change but it was another buffet, I expected them to be waiter served. The entertainment shows were ok, a lot of dancing to CDs and the lead up activities were poor. It would have been a lot better if the dancers had been singing. The Mayan show was fantastic, a must see.

My review would have been 5 stars...however we got to experience an extra 3 days at the Riu Palace Mexico due to an extended stay thanks to Irene which cancelled our flights. First of all - the staff is the best part of the Riu Tequila. They are so genuinely warm and welcoming that even my kids did there best to learn Spanish to interact with everyone. The entertainment staff created lots of fun for all the kids (big & small) with water polo, volleyball, soccer, ping pong...We organized our day around the sports schedule. We started each day at the absolutely glorious beach around 9 am and secured great spots at the Yucatan pool overlooking the beach. This was perfect as we had shade, overlooked the beach and the boys could grab whatever frozen drink they were on to that day - they each averaged at least a dozen a day...If you arrived around 11am spots were tight at the pool - but before - it was never a problem. We always joined in on the morning beach volleyball and games. We would normally have lunch at the Yucatan but got tired of their offerings. Lunch at the Tequila was much better (loved the fresh pasta there at lunch) - so second half of the stay we would gravitate back to the Tequila to have lunch and be ready for all the games which started at 2 pm. Amazing how time would fly and it would be 6 pm and time to prepare for drinks in the lobby and a quick check in on internet before dinner. I might add the walk to the beach was no big deal - happy to have a chance to walk off breakfast each day. We found the ambiance at the Tequila to be more open than the Yucatan and met many families from all over Europe in particular at the pool area and during the games. There was a whole gang of boys to keep my guys busy and the exchange between the kids was great. As a French American family - we found lots of French families but very few Americans which was fine by us. The boys just needed a reminder that football was indeed soccer:-) The rooms were fine as we took 2 for the five of us. I agree - they do not appear luxurious but are indeed very comfortable, large & spotless. I might add - we did not see a mosquito the entire stay & I had brought loads of spray which was never used. Concerning the food - being we have lived in France - we are really demanding (not picky). The quality of the food for the amount of people served just blew us away! It was really fantastic! I don't think you could find a better breakfast anywhere (except the Riu palace which offered mimosas & panninis every day). Lunch was definitely better at the Tequila than the Yucatan. Fell into a habit of guacamole for lunch followed by fresh pasta which was delicious. Dinner at the buffet was great - but we liked switching off with the a la carte restaurants. The steakhouse was very tasty & fun. The kids loved the Asian restaurant with the fried ice cream. Even though it was a buffet - it felt very different and was enjoyable. I think the Mexican was underrated. The tortilla soup is not to be missed! The fajitas were the weakest thing on the menu - but everything else was stellar. I must also add - 2 days after our arrival - we did a private tour to Chichen Itza, a cenote and Ek Balam. It was an incredible experience to visit these places and definitely gave us a new perspective on Mexico - its history and culture. I suggest taking this trip earlier rather than later in your stay as it is totally worthwhile. We totally had a fantastic time at the Riu Tequila. For families - I do not think this place can be beat in terms of value & fun!", "Date": "September 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Montreal, Canada", "Title": "\u201cLovely Resort\u201d", "Author": "juliasfish", "ReviewID": "UR118164275", "Content": "Stayed from Aug. 29 to Sept. 3, 2011 as a couple. It was our first All-Inclusive and chose Riu Tequila based on the Trip Advisor reviews and its price. Booked and travelled with US Airways Vacations - all very affordable. The staff and service were truly excellent. They are all very welcoming and helpful. The first day I accidentally left the safe open. When we went back, house service was already there. He had called security to report the issue and duly told me. Upon realizing it was my own fault and a quick glance to see if all our valuables were still there - passports, a large sum of money, two cellphones and a netbook - I told him to let them know it was fine. I appreciated his caution and honesty. Restaurant and bar staff were friendly and enthusiastic, especially the swim-up bar staff. Drinks were great - perhaps low on the alcohol, but you can always ask for another drink! We mostly ate at the Main Restaurant. It was a buffet, had a good selection and aside from a few misses, was pretty tasteful. We were only able to wake up early enough once - reservations have to be done before 9 am - to eat at a specialty restaurant and the Asian one was the only option left at the time. It wasn't bad, just a little too salty. Our room was spacious. We would have preferred a King or Queen bed instead of the two double beds pushed together, but we quickly forgot about it. My only complaint was that the sheets and blankets felt a little musty, but I think that was more due to the natural humidity of the area and not the hotel. The A.C. was wonderful. The mini-fridge was stocked with sodas, water and local beer. Oh, and there were liquor dispensers too! The beach was gorgeous - white sand and crystal blue water. It was very wavy though, probably not suitable for young children without parental supervision. There were plenty of lounge chairs available under the shade and under the sun. It was a short 5-7 min walk from the lobby, but can be 10-12 min from your room depending on your building's location. We also walked to the center of Playa del Carmen. It took us about 25-30 min. It was fun and lively with restaurants and touristic shops. All in all, the resort was great.

Thought it best to explain the reasons behind my ratings for each component of the review: Location: The hotel is a 'small' walk from the beach - about 10 mins from lobby, but 15 mins from our room. The walk is shaded so not a massive issue. There is still a Beach Bar that can be used for drinks and lunch, so you do not have to walk back. Beach had bright white sands, and crystal blue sea (can have big waves). It was a little overcrowded for our liking but this is expected due the number of large hotels on the beach front. Rooms: large, clean rooms, with an all inclusive mini-bar. Comfy beds. Only fault is that the drawers had a strong smell of damp and I didn't use these - not a massive issue though Service: entertainment staff fantastic. Show every night was absolutely brilliant. Constant entertainment around the pool at all times. Entertainment for all ages. Bar staff very friendly, with a constant smile on their faces. Reception staff could do with a little more of a energy..! Value: great value Beverage Selection: bar staff great - get you any cocktail you want, which is what we were drinking - Mango Daquiri was my tipple for the two weeks! Food: Fantastic!! I've stayed in a few AIs before, and this had by far the best buffet food. Had three restaurants and the only one that was average was the Asian one Trips: We went with Thomsons and I would Strongly Recommend the Mayan Hightlights - absolutely brilliant day out. Went to Chichin Itza, which was fantastic but went in the middle of the day and was just too hot. Would definitely recommend this hotel, as great value for money and the food and staff was excellent.

Now for the drinks.. accepted its all inclusive so you are sometimes going to get their own brand of alochol but we found that slowly as the evening wore on their drinks would get more watered down. We had especially a problem with the alcohol in the disco on the hotel, which in the end we discovered was not even the alchol but the pepsi. we found sometimes it would taste like the normal pepsi you expect but especially at the club and the free pepsi in the room mini bar would have this horrible aftertaste, which in end really put a downer on what i would say is a great hotel as we felt we had to go out of the resort to get any decent quality drinks. my second issue with the hotel is that i am a wheelchair user, and although while in the hotel they try and make it accessible certain little things like 2 steps to get up to the bar next to the entertainment areas were not accessible i saw this some problems in their other hotels which are near. Also entering the hotel from the driveway there would be a ramp to follow round and then it was just a tiny half ramp to get down, like they just gave up building it! if it was not for the assistance of my partner being able to bump me back down the curb i would have had great difficulty leaving the hotel. Lastly even though there was a bar for support to get into the tiny cubicle shower it was really difficult as slipperly and i bang and bruised my leg trying to get in and out safely and i can walk a bit so i wouldnt know who anyone permantly confined to a wheelchair would manage.", "Date": "September 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "poole", "Title": "\u201cAMAZING\u201d", "Author": "goowin", "ReviewID": "UR117917144", "Content": "Really the title says it all.

The hotel is fantastic, and the staff are extremely friendly and helpful. The bar staff work incredibly hard and the entertainment staff are out of this world, they get up early, do all the activities around the pool and kids club aswell as practice for the evening, then in the evening they do a kids show and then entertainment for adults, all of which is of brilliant quality, I have no idea how they get up the next day to do it all again! The room is extremely comfortable and has a minibar and fridge which is included in the all inclusive package (alot of other hotels charge extra). There is a main buffet restaurant, a oriental restaurant and a seafood restaurant down on the beach. I cannot comment on the seafood restaurant because the main buffet was so good we never got around to booking down there although we did eat in the oriental one night which was nice. Another good thing is that the other restaurants are included as part of the all inclusive aswell (most other hotels charge extra). The main buffet was out of this world, despite being a big hotel with many guests, the main buffet is huge and you hardly ever had to queue for food. The food was of very good quality and there was so much variety, they easily cater for everyones taste, even the most fussy eater would find plenty to enjoy. The waiting staff worked incredibly hard and were always providing you with fresh drinks and the main buffet is spotlessly clean, air conditioned and beautfully furnished. The pool is a good size and there is constant entertainment from the animation staff such as pool games and competitions and there is a swim up bar! The hotel has a sports bar which is open 24hours providing food an drink and a small nightclub onsight which is all part of the all inclusive. The beach is a 5-10 min walk down a walkway and is typical of mexico, white sand and crystal clear water, beautiful, and theres also a shuttle service provided by the hotel free of charge if you dont fancy the walk. We went on a couple of excursions, we went to Chichen Itza through first choice, and it was a very good day out, the guide spoke excellent english and his knowledge was also superb. We also visited Coba with first choice which was also very good, although we were unlucky to have one foreign couple with us for both trips that constantly spoke in their own language over the top of guide, very rude! We also went to Xcaret which was an amazing day out, bit of advise is that you can book it alot cheaper than holiday companies advertise from the little kiosk outside the shops just down the road from the hotel. This is a fantastic hotel and we would both return in a flash, only downside is the long flight, make sure you bring a good book or two because the flight is over 10 hours!

Upon arrival at the Riu Tequila we were met with very friendly staff and filled out the usual registration forms and got the key, Stayed in room 2307 which was clean and perfect, mini bar stocked with beer and soft drinks and optics were perfect and it was just the other side of the pool, cases arrived a few mins after us and as it was cloudy, on with the flip flops and time to look round, Started back at reception and passed a few racoon type creatures which left us alone as we did them (Ok i fed em a coulpe of times as they looked cute!) Ended up at the kiosk bar and again met by friendly staff and had a few drinks before venturing to the restaurant, table for two we were taken to a nice table and by the time we had chose our food because of the amount of selection ice water awaited and a glass of wine, perfect start to the hols. Thomson rep always on site to talk too, really nice people. During the week we went to the beautiful beach , didnt find the arch way first so felt stupid as its across the road, oh well i blame the sun in my eyes :) Beach is stunning, lovely water and water sports fo all ages, snorkelling was good and the swordfish i saw was brilliant! tried the beach bar again lovely drinks, snacks and at night became the mexican restaurant which we booked for and found is perfect setting by the beach and lovely food! Spent most days by the pool or the beach to be honest, the pool was lovely and cool in the morning and warmer due to heat in afternoon, didnt see any loud mouth chavs, anyone peeing in it etc as some reviews suggest, it was clean and friendly staff waiting to serve you and didnt see raccoons going in bags etc infact the odd one during the day asleep in the gardens! The bamboo where lunch is served with a wide selection of food to everyones taste becomes the Steak house at night and oh my god how fantastic it was, food, staff amazing, but you have to get up early to book for either the 7 or 9pm sitting! Met some amazing people from glasgow,dundee,(Jafacake) and the carl and linda who were celebrating the wedding anniversary, lovely people who made it harder to leave such an amazing place hope to see you all soon! Even seen four weddings taking place in the short time we were there and speaking to people they had fantastic time during their weddings! Tried to get the redonlinho behind the sports bar to do the Shuffle truffle(He didnt understand) He was only misery asse a few times, but we got him out of his shell by the end! Had all football for the fans of all teams which was a first i have seen, snacks here if peckish all fresh and nice, Nightclub opens until 2pm again up to date music and nice friendly staff The entertainment team were brilliant, including kids in everything, never bugging you by the pool to take part and i cant wait to go back with my kids soon as i have the money. One day returning to our room i saw an iguana which i got a few photo's of, brilliant!

Flew with thompson, great, pre booked seats no problems at all, plently of leg room too. Cancun Airport was a bit of a nightmare but once on coach transfer all smooth. I had emailed the hotel before we went and asked for high floor as we have travelled to the Dom Rep before and i know lower floors smell quite musty. No problems here we had two rooms next to each other and rooms were fine. Although I agree with other travellers about 2 beds pushed together, we had to share with our 15 year old daughter, so no privacy whatsoever!, Curtain in bathroom was strange too? as there was no door on bathroom it really would have been better if wardrobe wasnt in there too, if you left the wardrobe door open your clothes would get damp from steam from the shower. Fridge was very welcome addition though and drinks are refilled every two days. No problems with electrics in our room in fact it was good and much needed air con and fan worked well., we had no faulty equipment and the maid did a very good job every day. The hotel grounds are lovely and they are very well tended by staff, pool was nice but the swim up bar side was very warm and some people were very roudy at the bar!, bar staff great fun though, playing tricks on each other and the children around. Beach, was stunning, white sand, pale turquoise seas, and we ate lunch at the Yucatan almost daily, but we found the food at the Yucatan no where near as nice as Tequila!, less choice too. We managed to book Steak House 3 times and everytime it was great, very nice staff and good service. We booked the Asian once which was buffet but again very nice, didnt bother with Mexican as lots of Mexican food all the time anyway. Couldnt fault the food at the hotel, always loads of choice at every meal, something for everyone and so many choices of juice at breakfast even catcus juice! We did two trips, Tulum which was very hot and not very exciting but lovely swim on beach after, and Catamaran and Dolphin swim, booked with Thompson which was fantastic value for money, as a family with 3 teenagers it was \u00a387 each but really good, full day with lunch, drinks dolphin swim etc, only thing is dolphin swim photos really, very overpriced!! We walked to Playacar to 5th Avenue, about a 30 minute walk, nice walk but get a taxi back its much better after walking round shops and bars my feet were swollen from the heat. Entertainment shows were good, dancers work hard, and the mayan show was excellent, staff were friendly but not overly pushy.

I must admit, most of my holidays have been all inclusive, when working hard you want some chill time! I really enjoyed my holiday at the riu tequila, I never book without searching this site....sometimes its a good thing, sometimes not, reviews can be very mixed, but we went for it. Accomodation was clean and fine...king bed, ensuite, tv, mini bar, balcony, hairdryer, everything you need and room service daily - anything you need just ask the housekeepers, they're keen to oblige. Service was fantastic at reception, the bar and the restaurants, nothing is too much trouble, if you'd like something just approach them, theyre very helpful. Pool is average size wih two sections; 1either side of the pool restaurant. always clean, and the swim up bar is lovely and has shade should you want it. entertainment is carribean standard, generally we had a mix of caberet, magic act, gymnasts and an animal show. what I liked was the fact you can sit right next to it, or there is a gorgeous bar (where drinks come in real glasses!) 10 metres away where you can sit under the stars and watch the entertainment buts its not too loud so you can still play cards etc at the same time. The area is beautiful undenyably. The joy of mexico compared to some countries is that you can freely potter away from the hotel safely, about ten minutes walk is a shopping arcade with tourist shops, pharmacy, bank, jewellers and coffee shops. Play del carmen is a couple of miles, we were lazy and got a taxi for a few pounds. there you will find small chain shops such as Swatch, Diamonds International, Haagan Daz, a selection of bars and restaurants and the ferry port to cozumel. we popped to senor frogs for cocktails one night and the atmosphere was chilled and fun, nice music but not clubby. The beach is a five minute walk through the sheltered walkway, or you can get a ride with the golf buggy, its a nice walk to try and get some exercise to make me less quilty for all the great food! Food is a sensational choice. Main restaurant serves buffet for breakfast, lunch and dinner with an amazing array of choice, for brekkie you get your fry ups, cereals, pancakes, fruit, waffles. Lunch and dinner usually present with at least 3 different national cuisines at a time for instance you could get pizza and pasta, meat and veg, fajitas, The best variety i have ever seen, often 5 nationalities. The pool restaurant serves buffet lunch with salads, cooked meats and pizza, whilst at night it becomes the waiter service steak house. There is a chinese buffet restaurant too with all your favourites, and the restaurant at the beach (which is the same as our pool restaurant during the day and which you can also use) becomes a mexican at night so you can eat by the sea which is lovely. I believe you can book each speaciality restaurant once each week, so 3 speciality meals a week. Trips wise I can only comment on what we did. we booked the chichen Itza which is brilliant, but be prepared for a 3 hour drive and no shelter from the heat. you stop at a cenote on the way which is a natural pool where you can swim, very beautiful. note that you cannot climb the pyramid now, i was slightly dissapointed that much of it is being restored, i would have preferred to see natural ruins. also went swimming with turtles which was beautiful, a very natural experince, effectively you swim in their home and watch them do their thing, also you see other marine life. trip includes usually a trip to another cenote in the caves which is beautiful snorkelling around the stalagmites and stalagtites. went Jet skiing on resort, $60 for 30 mins but was exhilarating!! on site there is a sports bar which is open 24 hours where you can get snacks. they are basic! we are talking a fridge full of fruit, sandwiches and microwavable burgers, but if you peckish in the night, those are just fine! This is an honest review, sorry its long, but you have to give a fair trial when spending a lot of money on your yearly holiday, and i want you to feel what its like there.

At the airport, we were faced with lengthy queues to get through immigration and then another queue out into the main concourse. There didn't appear to be any Thomson reps until you got outside so it was easy to be accosted by locals trying to take your luggage in order to get a tip! What we found disappointing for a 5* resort was that there was only two beds in the room - both small doubles. We got to squeeze into one whilst our 11 year old daughter had a spacious bed to herself. You couldn't move the beds apart because of the headboard so lack of privacy and space wasn't great. And, no, I didn't complain at the resort because the Thomson rep didn't exactly exude helpfulness! THe plug socket in the bathroom continually came off the wall and the lamp on one of the bedsides continually flickered when switched off! There was no hooks to hang wet towels so I'm afraid we contributed to the massive washing pile the hotel must have on a daily basis. We have always stayed at RIU hotels and the room in this one was well below average compared to those elsewhere. However, outside the room, was fantastic! The hotel has two pools, one with a pool bar and one where the sports activities take place, we spent all our time at the sports pool because to be honest the other pool seemed to be occupied by loud mouth chavs who sat at the bar all day drinking and not leaving the pool until close of business - where were they going to the toilet?!! The entertainment staff were brilliant, very hardworking and funny. You could get involved if you wanted to but if you didnt fancy it, they didn't pester you either. CrazyJames was particularly funny doing the aerobics in the pool! In the evening it was the same staff and the shows and entertainment they put on were fab, we have been to other resorts where the entertainment let the place down but here they worked so hard and the variety was great. They also kept the kids entertained and seemed like they really enjoyed what they were doing. There is an extensive book swap facility which was good and also a plastic box by the Thomson desk with left over suncream and toiletries - good if you run out! The food and drink at the resort was plentiful and you never went hungry, the selection at mealtimes was amazing, if not a little strange to have the option of Chilli and brocolli at breakfast! The carved melons were very cleverly done too. All the waiter staff were friendly and helpful, although beware the scary 'maitre 'd' type guy at the entrance to the restaurant! The weather was great, if not a little humid but when it rained - it certainly rained - but never for long and after the intense heat, a little rain was welcome. The beach was a short walk away and was so beautiful; white sands, blue seas, a little wavey but not too much. The water was warm but be careful of the sun when in the water as its easy to forget you're burning when you're immersed in the lovely sea! If you're feeling tired after a day at the beach there is a cart to take you back to the hotel. There are only 7 spaces and beware other nationalities who do not know the meaning to the word \"queue\"!! The British Government could learn a thing or two from the Mexican Government when it comes to making money as well! You have to pay 700 Pesos (\u00a339) EACH to actually leave the country - this adds up to a hefty amount added onto an already expensive family holiday! There didn't appear to be one of the 'departure tax desks' at other flight desks - great way of stinging the tourists for more money! Beware the Raccoon type creatures mainly around the pool area. At first, they seem cute and endearing when they take your food but after a day or so you soon realise they are pests! We saw them going into peoples bags to retrieve food.

This has been by far the most amazing holiday I have ever had! The staff here were so incredibly friendly and they work SO SO hard! Whenever we passed anyone who worked at the hotel we always got a 'Hola' from them. Rooms were spotless and we were left different animals made out of the bath towels on most days. Within minutes of arriving in our room we recieved a phonecall from reception to ask if everything was ok with the room and did we need anything. Food was delicious, always something different to eat every day and they had themed buffet evening as well. We tried the Asian and Seak House a la cartes. Both were lovely but our favourite was the steak house. We didn't try the Mexican as we decided to go to a Mexican restaraunt in Playa del Carmen which was recommneded by our rep. It was called 'Fusion' and was only a 5 minute taxi ride away. Lovely restaraunt, gorgeous food and live music throughout the night. You could even sit out on the beach and have your meal if you wanted to. The shows at the Tequila were pretty good too. The entertainment staff work day and night but they never force you to take part in anything. The best thing was how they always made an effort to go and talk to people during lunch times or after the shows in the evening. The bar staff were even better! They worked so quickly and never stopped for a second yet they always seemed to keep everyone entertained by playing little practical jokes on each other! You were served quickly whether you tipped or not but we chose to tip (only 20 pesos here and there), after all, they work very long hours for very little money, plus we soon became friends with most of the bar staff. Our favourite barman was Fredy. After tipping him for a couple of nights we found that we never had to ask for another drink for the rest of the holiday. Before we had even finished our drink he'd made us another one ready and waiting! The two most popular shots they serve are called a 'Mexican Flag' and a 'Tequila Boom Boom'. I'd definitely recommend trying them but be careful not to have too many! We went on two trips whilst we were there; swimming with the dolphins and Xlpor, which is an activity park where you can go on zip wires, drive jeeps through the jungle, swim and go on rafts in a natural river through a cave. Both were excellent days and we really enjoyed them. There were always sunbeds around the pool. If you wanted beds in a prime position then you needed to get there by 8am but other than that there were always plenty of beds a little further back or on the artificial beach. It was literally only a 5 minute walk down to the beach which was a path covered in shade so it wasn't too hot. If you didn't want to walk then there was a little golf buggy that came round every 5 minutes or so but to be honest we preferred to walk seen as it was the only exercise we did all holiday! The beach...oh the beach, absolutely incredible! I've never seen water so blue and clear it was amazing! I went to the spa which was next to the pool and had a comination massage which was lots of different massages that lasted 1 hour 20 minutes - it was heaven! I could go on and on about how much we enjoyed our holiday and I almost cried when it was time to go home! I already know where I want to go on holiday next year and funnily enough, it's the Riu Tequila!

Check in was really swift, no problems. Bags arrived at the room 5 minutes after we did, which was great. Nice touch was the phone call from reception 15 mins later asking if everything was to our satisfaction - I asked for two more bath towels which were delivered to the room within 5 minutes - impressive. Standard rooms come with two double beds. After the first night went to see the first choice rep to ask if there was a possibility of a single bed as the two children would prefer not to sleep in the same bed. He told us \" no problem \". And, about ten minutes later a maid duly arrived at the room with a single bed for us. Again, really impressive service. Room was fine, very clean. Free minibar and optics was a nice touch, although to be honest never really took advantage of this. Room was made up every day to a very high standard - no complaints on this score. A/C was fine also. Grounds of this hotel are immaculate. Never saw any litter, cigarette butts, leaves etc on the pathways. Lighting on the pathways at night was subtle, but adequate. Pool / sunbeds - the two pools were good, again very clean. Sunbeds - well, wherever you go you will have the sunbed brigade. Because the hotel is quite leafy, most of the beds are in sunlight for either the morning or the afternoon - the prime ones are taken up early in the morning ( by 7am ). Most of the sunbeds regardless of the location are occupied by 10am. If you are that concerned about getting sun all day though, you can take a 5 minute walk or cart ride to the beach - more of that later. The ents staff are around the pool 10 till 1, then 3 till 5. You get the usual choice of activities - yoga, aqua aerobics, volleyball, basketball, table tennis, air rifle shooting etc plus salsa & merengue lessons, bingo amongst others. Although they encourage guests to participate, they are never pushy at all - we were never pressured into doing anything if we wished not to. Food - really good quality at all the restaurants. Breakfast was open 0700-1030 at the main buffet restaurant (Jalisco). Absolutely spoilt for choice at breakfast, lots of freshly cooked food to choose from. Lunch was served from about 1130 - 1630 at the pool restaurant ( Lupita) which doubled as the steakhouse in the evening. Huge choice here also - all the food that I could see was prepared and cooked on the day. Although self service, the waiters here were really good, going about their work without being obtrusive. There were cleaning staff on hand at all times making sure that the Lupita was spotless. The evening meal was served in the main Jalisco restaurant. Most nights there was a theme ( Italian, Caribbean, Mexican, Asian etc. ). There was a huge choice of different food on offer, the room and tables were pristine, the waiting staff were brilliant also. There was also a nightly speciality - for example barbecued lamb, huge seafood paella, beef wellington etc - really good. You could also book to use the speciality restaurants of an evening, namely the steakhouse, asian or mexican. Now this is the only gripe of our stay. To book any of these you had to queue from 7am outside the main restaurant - the steakhouse seemed most popular and was booked up pretty quickly. Some people frequented these restaurants almost nightly - which seemed a little unfair to me. On holiday, I would suggest that most patrons would not rise at 630am each day to go and queue to get into the restaurant that night - I did manage to get into the steak and asian restaurants once each during the stay, but resented having to get up so early and wait in the queue (which was sometimes snaking out the front of the hotel !). My suggestion to the hotel management would be to maybe limit the number of times that patrons can use the speciality restaurants, adopt a fairer booking system, or maybe issue tickets ( say one ticket per restaurant per week ) to guests so that they get a fair crack of the whip. That said, we used the steak and asian restaurants and found the food quality, ambience and service to be first class. Steaks were cooked exactly to order in La Lupita. The Asian (Bamboo) was different insofar it was buffet style. Great choice of food here, great quality, and the fried ice cream ? Marvellous! Did not get to use the mexican speciality restaurant for two reasons: - One, it was a ten minute walk away situated in the Riu Yucutan ( not a problem as such ) and two, there was high quality mexican food available in Jalisco every night - no real reason to visit that one ! Nightly entertainment - reasonable quality I think. There were dancing shows most nights and to be honest it got a little repetitive - saying that, the dancers/entertainers were very good, and worked very hard at what they did. A great touch from the ents staff was on some nights there were some activities within the lobby area of the hotel. They once set up a cashless \"free\" casino - each guest/room were given a number of tokens to play tables run by the ents team. The person winning most tokens getting a prize at the end of the night. This preceded the casino show. Before the mexican show, they set up a tequila bar within the lobby area. Really nice touches. Bars - brilliant. The pool bar during the day from 1000-1800 was brilliant. The bar staff here worked tirelessly and were always entertaining. A big gracias to the bar staff here - los hombres Ricardo, Juan, Avimael and Donas, and las mujeres Cruz, Belmes (sp ) and Rosy. Sorry if I have missed mentioning any of you. The main bar ( Kiosko ) of an evening was great. The team behind the bar were very accomplished and must mention their names - Gerardo, Felix, Arsenio, Ana, Verdasco, Freddy, Luis, Dalia - again sorry if I have missed any of you. The cocktails are brilliant and you must check out the Mexican Flag, the squashed frog, the top secret, the tequila boom boom amongst others - not so much for the drinks but more for the spectacle of it all - it's very entertaining. There is also a 24h sports bar (air conditioned) - you can get all your live english football games if you wish and you can get snacks at any time ( if you have the late night munchies for example ). There are also some video games, air hockey, pool etc. If you manage to venture out to the beach, it really is picture postcard territory. Down there you can use the facilities of the Riu Yucutan for drinks and food, and use their pool if you wish. It's a ten minute walk or get a lift on the golf buggy. Its beautiful down there. You can always get a sunbed and shade is provided by the palm trees. Beach is pristine white crushed coral sand ( doesn't burn your feet ! ) and the sea is very clean. Free wi-fi seems to be very popular down in the lobby area - a good facility for those who need to stay in touch or can't do without their iphone/ipad ! Trips - we booked ours at a kiosk just north of the hotel ( by Starbucks ) better prices than those offered by Thomson / First Choice. Exactly the same trips, just cheaper. In summary, I would go back to this particular hotel like a shot - apart from the booking of the show restaurants ( Please Riu, make this a little fairer ! ) I could not fault this place. A big big thank you to the staff, particularly at the pool bar and kiosko.", "Date": "August 31, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "sandhurst", "Title": "\u201cFantastic Hotel base for all ages\u201d", "Author": "whiteliz", "ReviewID": "UR117473485", "Content": "Been here many times and will return. This hotel has a lovely open plan layout, well kept grounds and is very family friendly. Rooms ........ didn't spend alot of time in there. nice big closet and safe, large bathroom dressing area. Separate toilet. Optics and the fridge is always stocked. Two doubles pushed together, weve shared it as a family of four and in later years asked for a camp bed. Now the boys are teenages they have their own room this time and myself, hubby and the two year old were just next door. Nice size balcony, enjoyed a few sit outs on it with a drink and a good book. Sports bar ........Open 24hr, air conditioned, nice! Served hot and cold drinks. Food fridges, from fresh fruit to pizza, DIY reheat in microwave, not for me but I am told its delicious. Great place for bringing the teens together in the evening and catching up with the footy in the day. Pool and activities ............ one with pool bar and jacuzzi other small for activities such as Waterpolo, Waterbasket. Volleyball/football on the sand area. All ages are welcomed to join in with the shooting, darts, boccia, shuffle board and the afternoon silly games are very amusing! Animacion team changes from year to year with a few long standing members with 10 years service and loyalty to the hotel. All work very hard, are friendly and want you to have a great tim. If you want to be left alone they are respectful of this. The beach ........... is only a short stroll (two songs on my ipod) I'm talking as a fit 37yr old mum sometimes carrying a heavy two year old and a bag! Had to chuckle at the fit young men jumping on the golf carts, couldn't be bothered to walk or maybe not so fit!!! but if you really can't be bothered or are unable too walk then the cart goes back and fourth non-stop during the day or the many benches lining the walk are a welcomed rest with plenty of shade. It was rarely full and the wait wasn't too long for the next one. The food .......... is fresh and very good, plenty to choose from. Love breakfast, always got my egg cooked fresh, easy over and my son enjoyed his omelete and choice of fillings. No bacon one day, ran out! pissed me off but I had a cereal and pastry breakfast that morning instead. We ventured out to Playa del carmen, 5 mins away, 70 peso's for a regular taxi and double for a 7 seater. Felt secure and safe. Senor frogs was entertaining and on other evenings we booked the speciality restaurants to break up ''the food boredom'' most people complain about at any All inclusive. Restaurants get busy around 8pm but we avoided these times, sometimes have an early tea or went later. Theres plenty of choice to have a different meal every day and it does vary from day to day with a specail dish or speciality night. The pasta bar is great, different types of pasta, sauces, bacon, ham, veg etc etc choose what you want and its cooked by the chef while you wait. Steak restaurant had a great meal one night and a lousy one the next! kids hated it so hoped of to th buffet without us. Asian restaurant was fantastc, loved it and the deep fried icescream drizzled in chocolate sauce reminded me of Thailand. Tipping, yes we did if the service wasvery good but we were very discrete and not as bold as some of our American friends. How much did we tip? anything from a couple of dollar tips and some very handsome tips to those that looked after us well. Evening entertainment ............ its not broadway production and I am bored of the shows now after four visits. The audience participationshows are always amusing however it was just in the back ground whilst we enjoyed a drink, chat or game of cards. If you really hate it you can grab a drink down at the Yucatan and sit down the beach or at the pool bar. Be as social or quiet as you want. Days out .......... lots to do this time we went to Xel-ha which was fantastic, included good food,drink, towels and equipment, I will definately go back there. Cenote Azul was recomended to us by a local and only cost 60 peso's to get in. So we jumped in a Taxi who was happy to wait for us and spent a good couple of hours there. It was beautiful so we went back a second time. This time the taxi left us there and the Cenote staff called us a taxi, the call cost $1 but it was only slightly cheaper than having the taxi wait, this meant we could stay longer. Weve done the dolphins in the past, can't get that wrong where ever you choose to go. The speed boat snorkeling trip from Cancun we did 6 years ago, the speed boat was good fun (great facial from the sea spray) but the snorkling around lots of boats and smelly fuel was crap, very commercial. Whale shark swimming trip was fantastic, 101% an experience not to be missed.

If I had to be honest, I preferred the Jamaican one as that was a hotel rather than a 'club hotel' which the Tequila was (the difference being the rooms are in separate buildings spread over the site). However, the usual good Rui experiences were there - very friendly staff, excellent food (the choice at the main buffet restaurant was incredible both for dinner but also at breakfast) and the drinks available in the room minibar which was filled every two days withour fail. There were three themed restaurants which needed to be booked very early on the day we wanted to eat (if not done by 7.30 am we missed it) and of these three, the steakhouse was the best (and most popular) followed by the Asian (which was a buffet but very good - you have to try thr fried ice cream!). The Mexican was ok but we had to walk to the Riu Yucatan which was about 10 mins. away. The pool area was ok although the water was warm and we spent more time at the beach which was great! Many sunbeds (in shade or sun), white sands and the water was clear blue and cooloing - it also helped that the beach was right next to the sister hotel, the Riu Yucatan and we could eat lunch there. We all got bitten by gnats although my wife suffered worse with two of the bites becoming infected and two of us had trouble with 'mexican tummy' - however, this is par for the course when you holiday in hot climates. The Chichen Itza trip was excellent with a good lunch on route and the chance to swim in a cenote (water cave) which is highly recommended. Also wnet to the XPlor park with more cenote swimming and rafting and an excellent zip wire ride - well worth the visit. We also went on a speedbaot trip where we had the chance to drive speedboats around the bay and go snorkelling. Weather was generally hot although it rained on 5 out of 10 days, although this was usually only for a few hours. Staff all very helpful - I left my watch in a locker in XPlor and reception were very helpful in liaising with the park and I got it back the following day. The entertainment was a little amateurish although the kids entertainment between 8.30 and 9.30 was great for the little ones. They made a good stab at performing Mamma Mia! although it was all mimed.

We were concerned about weather and the fact it's advertised being next to a jungle (mosquito's), we read every update of trip advisor for weeks prior to booking and need not have worried. It only rained a few times which only lasted 15 - 20 min and we never seen any mosquitos. Travel: Its a long flight not helped by the long queues and a lack of direction signs in the Cancun airport. Top tip: Be very careful with the immigration paperwork you have to complete on the plane and hand into the Mexican customs officers. Should you get this wrong you will be sent to back of queue to find another form. Once you get through the baggage check, the staff will be waiting outside and everything goes smoother from there in their hands. A bus ride of no more than an hour gets you to the hotel, where a welcome cool refreshing punch is handed to you and your luggage is taken to your room. Hotel: Great layout, several pools, bars everywhere, rooms immaculate and staff that are a credit to themselves, some were very witty, all hard working and cant do enough for you. Meals are fine, plenty of choice (dont know why people have complained about the food) if you dont like it, try something else from the massive selection on display each night. Excursions: This was our main disappointment, the cost was a big rip off compared to Europe holidays, so be careful, I suggest you ask fellow holiday makers that went on the trips and ask their advice to see if you can get value for money. Routine: We spent a lot of time during the day using beach facilities at Yucatan and Playa Car hotels (beach, snorkels, kayaks etc) and off course their bars and restraunts. Evening Entertainment: The hotel ents staff are energetic and produce the majority of shows each night. These range from cheesy to very good. We found the bar staff, very entertaining just with the antics they get up to at the bar.

We tipped when we thought the service had been particularly good. There were a few downsides the main one being the size of the pool as it wasn't very big compared to the number of rooms, plus, as the hotel is over the road from the beach extremely hot as it didn't get the sea breeze. We didn't bother using the pool at all as the beach was absolutely lovely, great sand plenty of room and lots of sunbeds. The 3 restaurants that you could book (if you want to get up early!) were quite nice but the menu was very limited and was buffet style for some of the courses. The steakhouse wasn't buffet style but there was no choice for starter or dessert only the main course. The main restaurant wasn't open for lunch so you were limited to the beach restaurant or the pool restaurant both serving the same food and with no waiter service even for drinks and these were served in plastic glasses.

Playa del Carmen was a good 30 minute walk away or a 5 minute taxi ride costing \u00a34 each way, there are plenty of shops and bars and the ferry port for the island Cozumel there is also a bus station where you can get a bus to Cancun, Tulum, and even Chichen Izta.

The staff is always ready to serve you and they are very friendly. The beach is only a 5 minutes walk away and the pool has a good size and has many activities during the day around it. Tips: 1. The best tip I can give you is that when you get to the Cancun airport make sure you talk to one of the travel guides inside the airport, they are on your left hand side once you exit the baggage area. They gave me a coupon for all the tours (7 tours total) for US$50 per person, the only trade is to assist to one 90 min presentation in a beatiful hotel. 2. Coba is better than the Chichenitza trip, is a lot shorter (Chichenitza can be a 12 hrs day) 3. In the Riu Tequile, make sure you get up early to make reservations for the two a la carte restaurants, the Asian one was pretty good. 4.

The hotel has 2 Sister hotels over the road Riu Yucaten and the Rui Playacar. Tequila is definitely the better hotel of the 3 in terms of up keep and food. As a guest at any of these 3 hotels you can use the other hotels facilities but you will get the same food and entertainment at each. I would only recommend Playacar or Yucaten if you know you'll never be off the beach. We went with Thomson and found them pretty rubbish. On the plane they flogged extra movies and games at a price and hence didn't put the normal tv channels on for 1hour after take off, poor quality headphones (I had 6 pairs swapped out but still never found any that worked for >5mins). Also on the plane there were no free soft drinks with any of the meals - not even a small foil covered cup of water. When we did arrive at the airport and got on our transfer bus to our 'all inclusive' hotel they tried to sell us beer and cold drinks. At the resort any issues we raised with Thomson they never did anything about (it would help here if they logged what each complaint was about rather than writing it on a scrap of paper). Also do not book any of the excursions to Tulum or Chicken Itza unless you can cope with a coach trip that picks up from endless hotels and bus stations. Be under no illusion this not a 5 star hotel. The hotel grounds and reception are very nice and very well kept. You never stop seeing staff around the grounds cleaning and gardening. All the staff were friendly and the bar and restaurant staff worked very hard. The reception desk staff are terrific - any issues go direct to them. On arrival we asked for an extra bed in our room for our daughter and this was done promptly. 1 night my daughter was sick in the night. Again the reception staff hunted out new bedding and a pillow for her in the early hours. They also phoned us 30min later to ask if we thought she needed a doctor. The bedrooms are very dated and very in need of a refurb. We could have coped with dated rooms if the air con was reliable which it never was. Also the mini fridge in the room didn't really chill drinks. We took our kids out of school for a few days and at this point the hotel was bearable. However, as the English school holidays kicked in there was a huge change in the volume if people in the hotel, pool and restaurants. Food was plentiful and nice (nice but not 5 star hotel quality). For the evening meal there is an extensive buffet restaurant or the option to book 1 of 3 themed restaurants (Steak House - excellent/v popular, Mexican - nice food, poor service, Chinese - ok). The hotel's kids club is pretty poor. It didn't feel we were leaving our kids with trained childcare experts - just some of the young entertainment staff who wanted to use the kids for their nightly show. On one day the kids were over 30mins late back by which time we were in a complete panic looking for them as there was no one in the kids club room and no note to say where they were. On another day they let the kids walk around the pool unsupervised encouraging them to talk to strangers to get answers to a quiz. I would not recommend leaving your kids with these people. Found we were going a bit nuts by the end of a 2 week holiday here i.e. same food repeated, same theme nights, same daily fight for sun beds by the pool. Inconsistent rules i.e. pool staff not consistent in removing towels from reserved sun beds around the pool AND queued at 6.50am to get a coveted steak house booking, was 1st in the queue but there were still no bookings as they had let someone do a block booking - wouldn't have minded if they were in front of me in the queue!

Lastly, I was traveling with young adults and we all went to the disco located on the complex and had a wonderful time as well. There were activities for all throughout the vacation.

However, Im sorry to say that it was immediatley obvious that the furniture etc in the dining rooms and communal area are heavily stained in particular the chairs in the main a la carte restaurant.. The overall condition is generally run down and needs urgent attention in my opinion. The staff the hotel were fabulos with the exception of the maitre'd in the buffet restaurant. We were a party of eight people and on the two occassions we wanted to dine as a group we were shown into the restaurant and no tables were set up to accommodate us. As a result we were embarrassed as we had to hang around while the table was set up and other diners were trying to have their evening meal without a crowd hanging about. When we noted some constructive critism on the \"comment form\" we could see that the maitre'd was not a happy chappy. On the final day we checked out at reception and had about an hour to kill so we had a final cocktail and was boarding the bus to the airport and a member of staff called me back to reception to say that they wanted me to pay $150 for damage to a ceiling fan that was apparently caused 5 days earlier. What a farce! I had been at reception ad spoke to them twice after checking out and at no time was this mentioned. I advised them this was not damaged by us so under no circumstances was I paying this. the upshot was the hotel mangaer then suggested I pay $50 to which the answer was another NO.

This is NOT a five star luxury hotel. If that is what you are looking for, then you will be disappointed. However, if you are looking for pleasant 3/4 star accommodation, which is excellent value for money, then the Tequila is for you. The rooms here are fairly basic and a little outdated but they are spacious and spotlessly clean (cleaned daily by the lovely maids). The beds we found to be firm but extremely comfortable. I don't normally sleep well away from home but I have to say I had the best night's sleep ever here. The staff here (they are definitely 5 star!) really make this place. All day long you will see them working tirelessly, always with a smile on their face and a friendly 'ola'. We had problems with the toilet in our room on our second day here (our room nearly flooded out), but a quick call down to reception and a maintenance man was despatched immediately to deal with the problem. Having never stayed All Inclusive before, I was a little concerned what the quality of food would be like. I needn't have worried, the food here is pretty good on the whole, with a large choice of things to eat (even a small vegetarian section). However, I would recommend using the Jalisco buffet restaurant for dinner in the evening. We found the food to be of a better quality here than in either the steakhouse or the Bamboo Asian restaurants. The evening entertainment is a bit mixed but we really enjoyed Mamma Mia which they put on and the traditional Mexican Mariachi band were great. We travelled to the Tequila with Thomson's at the end of November last year (2 weeks), and generally speaking found them to be pretty good. Our rep Andy was always on hand to answer any questions we had and luckily we had no flight delays in or out. My only complaint would be that the excursions were prohibitively expensive which meant that we only did three (Coba, Xcaret and Swimming with Dolphins). Would I recommend this hotel?

We arrived in a tropical downpour but had a warm greeting and a fruit punch on arrival in the very impressive open foyer. We were shown to our rooms, but had a door with a lock which wouldn't open so were moved to different rooms in block 35. The room was very spacious and very well equiped, no hint of any musty smells I have read reports of. There are curtains dividing the dressing/ washing area from the bedroom, but this didn't pose any problems. There is a door to the toilet and a seperate cutain to the shower cubicle. Can't understand the need for a drinks fitment with optics to the wall of the washing area and not sure why they have chosen various shades of brown for the soft furnishings, but no worries we were very happy in our room. It had a nice balcony on the ground floor overlooking lush green grass and tropical foliage. We had visits from the acouti's most evenings who love a piece of fruit if you have any, very sweet. The hotel was very attractive, low lying and nestling in verdant extensive grounds. Could be a problem if you are not fit and able to walk as everything is quite spread out. A bit of a walk up to meals at the main restaurant and 10 mins across the road to the beach. There is a beach shuttle which runs evey 10 mins or so, but at busy times we found it couldn't carry the amount of people waiting for it. Lots of people opted to walk, it is a nice stroll but if the shuttle had a few more seats it would be useful. The restaurant was very busy particularly in the evenings when I think people from the other Riu's came over for the main evening meal. Food was great, three of us are vegetarian and there was usually something nice to eat. Much more variety for the meat eaters though. The salad bar became a little repetitive after two weeks and the puddings often didn't taste quite as good as they looked, but the chef's, waiting and serving staff all worked extremely hard to make sure we were all happy. Met the assistant chef one night, when she realised I was vegetarian she said to ask her to make something if we couldn't find enought to eat, not really much chance of that, though very kind of her. The beach was absolutely picture perfect! Turqoise water, white sand, palm trees. Just too many people. In fact that was our only real gripe about the place, very overcrowded. Not sure how many people they can hold but it was swarming. We gave the pools a miss completely simply because of the amount of people crammed in around them. Very noisy, with a lively pool games/18-30's type atmosphere. Shame because they looked lovely when empty, perhaps the pool complex needs to be a bit larger? Plenty of bars around, we spent most days down on the beach and used the beach bar at the Yucatan. As with all the staff at the hotel, the bar staff worked extremely hard. Large selection of cocktails they mixed individually, although a lot of them tasted quite similar. Not sure which alcohol brands they used but with the amount they poured in each drink, they really should have tasted stronger than they did. I will leave you to draw your own conclusions! The place was kept very clean, there was always someone cleaning the ladies loo's no matter what time of day you popped in! Loved the towel art in the bedrooms. Outside there is a plaza with various crafty/souvenir shops 5 mins walk from the hotel, or Playa del Carmen a much larger shopping centre a 10 minute taxi ride away (cost 70 peso's.) We did a trip to Tulum, Xcaret the eco park and a snorkeling trip to Akamal which we enjoyed thoroughly, although it was extremely hot and the humidity energy sapping walking around Xcaret and Tulum. No idea how the elderly people I saw doing it were managing! Overall we loved Mexico and the Mexican people, much like the caribbean but with more happening and more culture. The hotel was lovely and the all inclusive package the most generous we have found anywhere with some water sports included aswell. Only problem, too busy for us, too many people and a bit noisy. Just a final word of warning, the departure tax when leaving Cancun airport is now \u00a338 per person! As a family of four we were mugged on the way out for \u00a3160! A child pays the same as an adult! So keep some back! Just one other thing, sort out your telephone advice line First Choice. had three questions to ask the girl I spoke to, she couldn't answer any one of them, kept me waiting on hold while she found out each time at 10p a minute! Told us we would have to have two taxi's for a family of four when I tried to order a private transfer from the airport. Also said I would not need to order vegetarian meals for the flight as we had upgraded to premium which we found out was also wrong.

But, for those who already been to a \"not bad\" all inclusive, then maybe pick a better resort. Overall, the resort is pretty good. What do I liked the best is people and service. I will give 5 star on the service, the whole time we stayed there were greeted with great enthusiasm! There is also a plaza playaCar shopping center, about 5 minutes (walk) away from resort, plenty of little shops there. I also love the small booths that they have in resort. They were there on Monday night and maybe also on Thursday night (not sure about Thursday, because we left on Tue.) You can find some special hand crafts, or maybe buy some souvenirs that you didn't have a chance to buy. There is a small distance from resort to beach, and we always took the free golf cart to beach because of the heat and humidity, but walked back by end of the day. The walk is quite nice with all surrounded trees and only took about 5 minutes or less. What I like the least is the room... which is maybe most important for everyone. But, I kind of ignored it because of all other good things that still made my trip a happy trip. The AC in the room is not cold enough even turned to the lowest temperature, you will need the fan on all the time to help the air circulation and cool down the room. Also, it was very humid in the room, bed sheets and pillows always felt a little damp. There was ONE very uncomfortable thing. I felt so uncomfortable sleeping on the bed, and thought maybe it was just me not used sleeping in a different bed. But I later found that they had this big rubber band wrapped around the mattress and under the bed sheets and a thick bed cover. Maybe it's just I'm very sensitive and surprised I could feel that even covered with thick cover and bed sheets. But, I just can feel that big rubber band every night on my back and couldn't sleep well. There are 3 restaurants you can pick, but will need to make reservations in the morning. We woke up around 7am in the morning to make reservation just in case. The buffet doesn't need any reservation. I think the buffet food is only ok, but you will find few variety dishes everyday.

PLEASE PLEASE, do NOT listen to the bad reviews. It's all false! I went with family/friends and we had 3 rooms. I loved there rooms (the bathroom was private and spacious and very much different then some hotels i've been too) My friend had a problem with her air conditioning, called the front desk, and they immediatly switched her room to the same floor. The staff is SO helpful and incredibly nice! The food tasted unreal every day! They have a buffet, and 3 \"resturants\" that you have to reserve with! We went to the Asian and Steak house resturant and I can't express how yummy the food was and how amazing our waiter was. We gave them tips every day for being so nice and helpful! We wanted to try the mexican resturant but the buffet was just to good that we ate there 3 for dinner 3 times. SOO much to chose from! The cool thing about going to Riu Tequila is that you have access to 3 other hotels next to you which means you can swim, eat, and roam around the other hotels! They had 2 main pools which were very nice but we were at the ocean everyday! The ocean was amazing, felt beautiful, and it was the bluest water I have seen since going to Hawaii. The Ocean is 5 minutes away walking distance but there is also someone who is always willing to take you if you get a little lazy! The only odd thing was that a lot of the girls at the Ocean were laying out/swimming topless but I guess it IS a vacation! In the night time they had the coolest shows I have ever seen. Anyone familar with \"Coco Bongo?\" Its a big show/bar downtown in Cancun. The people who perform at our hotel ALSO work at Coco Bongo so you don't even have to pay check out Coco Bongo when you have the ppl who work there dancing in front of you!

Very well run hotel excellent food and drinks. The staff can not do enough for you. The Entertainment staff were very good providing poolside entertainment in the day and fairly high standard shows at night. The bar staff were fantastic at both the swim up bar and the square bar near the theatre.I sat there for ages watcing them work so fast. The are itself seemed very clean and tidy. The beach was fantastic, it was starting to get busy when we were there but you had no problems getting a lounger on the beach. The pool was a bit more difficult but have a good walk round the edges might be in the shade when you get there but it soon changes. The hotel trys to operate a no saving loungers with towels rule which nobody abides by which is really annoying because we did. Ate once at the steakhouse very good and it was my daughters birthday and they sang a song and gave a cake. Food in general was good massive choice. the trips I thought were very expensive and everything had gone up when we got there,wish we had tried the trader in the small market. Did the pirate boat trip to Cancun very entertaing but I found it a bit tight on the boat and very hot also the bus journey is a bit of a killer. We thought the day trip to Explor was amazing well worth doing if you have older children my two girls 13 and 16 loved it 150ft high Zip wire above the jungle and swimming through caves fantastic.I have been to many theme parks but this is very real and I would say it is a 5 star park brilliantly organised and amazing food and drink. Would love to go back and do a bit more but we did a lot of chilling by the pool and on the beach and thoroughly enjoyed it. If you do go find Arsendro at the bar near the theatre (green waistcoat) and tell him Papa says hello,my girls wanted to take him home great guy. one fault we did have was we had two rooms next to each other the girls room was fine but ours did smell a bit fusty and sometimes a bit of a drain smell.We told reception and immediatley they cleaned the room and put in a dehumidifier which did seem to do the trick.Not perfect but we didnt want the hastle of moving rooms.

Me and my Fiance stayed for 2 weeks in April- the weather was perfect everyday.. The hotel was nice- We didn't spend much time around the pool as the beach was so amazing I had to go everday. We did try to get sunbeds around the pool once and couldn't as it was always very busy with families and lots of children.. This is not a complaint but I like to spend my days quietly relaxing and soaking up the sun so we liked the beach best.. The sea is clear and bright blue and the sand is pure white.. If you walk left along the beach you will come to Playa Del Carmen town- it is a long walk.. If you walk right along the beach it gets more and more secluded where you will see more wild life.. Definately worth the trek The Rooms are spacious and very clean- we had the nicest cleaner who always made nice towel animals for us and gave us a few extra beers as my partner didn't like the draft much.. You have optics in the room to mix a drink while getting ready which was a nice touch. Couldn't fault the hotel staff always working hard and friendly. The entertainment was ok-they do get the audience involved sometimes which can be very funny.. The nightclub however is awful- DJ was playing very dated music and always seemed to struggle to get to the next song- We went in once for a drink, left and never made it back. Sports bar was good for late night snacks - had games and pool tables in there etc.. The food was nice - my favorite was breakfast with fresh smoothies, fresh fruit, fry up to cure hangovers- Lunch and dinner was repetitive and I was a little disappointed considering all the reviews rave on about how nice the food is but I find Rius all the same in the food department- I have to say I had no sickness nor did my partner and everything seemed to be cooked properly and clean.. We found a bar/resturant in the main town called FUSION- you must go it is the best place I have ever been- it has little tables on the beach- the service and price is unreal. We swam with Dolphins and went on a Jungle treck- both recommended Best trips I have ever experienced although Thomson do rip you off on prices- I do wish we had found the mini market to the left of the hotel before as they sold the trips to Thomson and would have sold to us at a much cheaper price. We met a few people who done this and had no problems.. The bar crawl to Cancun- what a complete waste of money- The bars were not that great apart from hard rock cafe... Playa del Carmen is a great night out chilled out bars with shisha pipes and swings- or lively club/bars where you can dance the night away (Cancun is seriously over rated) .. Shopping is an effort- You have to seriously haggle because you will get ripped off and you can get things for half price or less if you put the effort in-.. Aviod the flee markets down the alleys they try to get you in and turn quite nasty if you dont buy anything.. Although it seems like I have complained this really was the best holiday ever I just try to write the review honestly- I am not that fussy about hotels aslong as they are clean, I like to have lots to do and being able to venture out lots and experience new thing which Mexico is perfect for ..

Pool area was lovely with lots of shaded areas. we did go to the beach a few times but there wasn't enough shade there as there are only palm trees so you had to move with the sun which was a bit of a pain. The breeze was lovely though & the sea was very nice. They also kept the beach clear of seaweed by digging a hole & burying it!

The food in the Tequila was brilliant, so much choice & very good quality. we didn't eat in the speciality restaurants as the main restaurant was so good. The pool restaurant at lunchtime was also very good with a brilliant selection of salads. The daytime activities were well organised with no hassle of joining in. Evening entertainment was OK. Started off with getting all of the children on stage to dance & play games, we didn't watch any of the proper shows though as they started quite late. It was also very very hot in the theatre area so I would suggest sitting in the outdoor area for a bit of a breeze. The sports bar was a nice area to cool down. There are fridges with food available 24 hours a day (sandwiches, fruit, pizza, burgers, hotdogs) which you heat in the microwave.

The food was always hot and well presented and catered for even the fussiest of eater and the service was very good. The 3 speciality restaurants were good as well, would well recommend trying the fried ice cream in the Asian restaurant. You need to be up early to book the speciality restaurants as they get booked early. Can only get booked on the day you want to use them and there are two sittings, 6.45/7 and 8.45/9. We found the later sittings always got booked first. The hotel grounds were also immaculate and well maintained. Both the Thomson and First Choice rep were very knowledgeable and helpful and were not just there to sell the excursions like some places. Would recommend Xel-ha and the jeep/sea safari even though it was a long day. Would well recommend the cocktails best I have tasted on all inclusive. The bar staff worked exceptionally hard in the heat at night when it was busy and were always so friendly. You never had to wait long to get served even when it was busy. The beach was amazing, only a short walk through the covered walkway or you can get the beach buggy from outside reception. Always plenty of sunbeds available and you got a nice breeze there. The pool was always very busy and you found the British were the worse for reserving sunbeds! Despite notices telling people not to do it, towels were put out early and not being occupied for some time later.

The hotel has been refurbished since my last visit in 2006. I had a pleasant first floor room overlooking the well kept and lush tropical gardens. The air-con ran quietly all night allowing sleep which is always a bonus. I particularly like this hotel as it is not too big and the atmosphere is friendly and informal (The sister hotel, Riu Yucatan did not have the same atmosphere, being much bigger). Staff, as always, made everyone welcome and nothing was too much trouble for them. The range of food was excellent as was the food quality. Lunchtimes in the poolside restaurant were less appealing this time due to people now being allowed in without wearing tops. i did not watch the evening shows but for those who like the usual themed mime sessions by the Animation staff, I believe they were OK. Always plenty of sun loungers available. Optional pool/poolside activities if you wish. Great white sandy beach a short walk away (or use free buggy). Crystal clear sea. Plenty of sun loungers. Use the Yucatan's facilities for drinks & snacks. I hired a bicycle to visit Playa Del Carmen during day to help burn a few calories off! Cycles located just inside hotel main gate. The cycle rental guys also do an excellent ATV tour through the jungle with a swim in a cenote (underground cave) during the tour which is 1/2 day long. Playa del Carmen worth a visit but is touristy. Once you start getting tanned you are left alone more. Cheaper trip prices can be negotiated outside the hotel. for example, I saved over 1/3rd of the cost on a trip to Coba by hiring my own taxi and buying entry tickets at the attraction itself. (I found Coba disappointing so was pleased not waste more cash than I did!) I found a really good bar with different live rock/blues bands in the evenings on 5th Avenue. I don't know what it was called but it was opposite Cafe Sasta (which does good coffee). I visited Senor Frog's in Playa Del Carmen which is very popular and widely advertised - if you go there prepare to spend a lot of money on trivial entertainment - always ask what it will cost first! One of the Reps said they no longer visit the bar on their Bar Crawl because of the expense. Back at the hotel, try a Miami Vice cocktail at the bar. Highly recommended! Watching the bar staff at work is entertainment in itself. How do they do it? They appear to have so much fun as they go about their busy, busy job. Overall, another successful trip to Mexico.

This hotel is the lesser of the Riu family in the Playacar complex but is the most relaxing as far as atmosphere and flora and fauna. The beach front resort's grounds dont even compare to the Tequila. Staff- perfect, the subdirector provided a special dinner for my wife and I and Salvatore at the front desk was the most helpful and took care of our every need. The Lupita's wait staff especially the concierge anf manager created an enviroment with steller service. Food- the buffet's are good but are somewhat repetitive. Bamboo is good, Lupita is stellar and the Mexican beach front dining is alright. Entertainment- The resort was always on point for things to do except for the shows. Also be very wary about the excursions and what you are geting. If the price is to low dont do it. The taxi service that is located on the resort is the biggest in the city, very safe and very reliable. Check out the Jungle and cenote atv tour located to the right of the big stallion statue if you are facing out from the lobby. Poncho was the guide and he gave the most amazing tour with more in depth info then we could get anywhere. He also told us what to do, who to go thru and what to pay.

Yes all inclusive does get repetitive but that's often because we all eat too much at each meal !! There is so much choice here you want to sample everything at once. We regularly walked down to the sea and swam there and the breeze made the hot weather more bearable, although have to say lunch at The Yukatan was no where near as good as at the Tequila - less choice and not as clean and there were always dirty dishes left lying around. Walking into Playa del Carmen was pleasant (although very hot so make sure you take water with you ) and the shopping precinct on 5th Avenue was again spotless and welcoming, especially in the evenings walking around the atmosphere was fun with local bands playing and street traders - not too much hassling. Trips. After seeing how much Thomsons were charging for their trips we asked around in town and managed to book a lovely trip to Chichen Itza for half the cost - 50USD instead of 109 ! It was from a reputable Tourist Info (Cenote Azul Tours & Travel) shop just opposite the road down to the Cozumel ferry and half the payment was made to the driver on the day so you didn't have to pay up front and worry they may not turn up. Also it was in a minibus so fewer people on the escorted tour, the restaurant and then the visit to the Cenote. The next trip we booked from the Dive shop at the hotel to the Dolphinaris - again half the cost and fewer people to share the dolphins with ! That was amazing and well worth the cost for the experience to swim with and stroke them. All in all, we couldn't find any faults with the Tequila - all the staff were friendly and happy and the animation team worked tirelessly every day.

Our room was spotless and we were given fresh towels every day and each day they were presented as a variety of different animals from elephants to bunnies...very impressive and a nice touch! Our cleaner was incredibly friendly, professional and polite...she even came to say goodbye and give us both a nice big hug!!! All of the staff conduct themselves with the upmost respect and professionalism and they always have a smile and acknowledge you whenever you pass!

There is a nice spacious bathroom area seperated from the sleeping area by a curtained archway...nice design! Two double size beds that are comfy and clean! The fridge is a good size and is well restocked every second day! If you are looking forward to having Sol or Corona in your all-inclusive you will be disappointed...you get XX which is rather boring but nice enough! This was the first time we had done the all-inclusive thing and we both agree that it's not for us. There are 4 'different' restaurants and there is plenty of food and you will think there is lots of choice but there isn't really! All of the food is pretty much made of the same things but just presented differently and we were very fed up with it after the first week...the second week was like ground hog day!!! As for the quality well it's very average but then again it's mass produced and it's an all-inclusive...definately not 5 star!!! Whatever you do, don't have any of the steak...dreadful, stringy, fatty, chewy and just tastes soooooo cheap! The food is the only realy bad thing about this resort and apart from the steak it's not even that bad just gets very repetitive! We just prefer going out for evening meals to different restaurants for the variety of food and atmosphere etc! The beach is only a 5 minute stroll down a beatiful covered walkway! As others have mentioned there is a golf buggy type thing that will take you down to the beach but we found it ridiculous that people were actually hanging about waiting for this given how close the beach actually is...I know you're on holiday but this is just complete laziness...there were actually people jumping on the buggy while the guy was trying to turn it round just to try and get a seat on it back to the hotel...pathetic!!! It's a really nice stroll to the beach and thanks to the lush, green fruit trees covering the wlakway it's all shaded! The beach is stunning and there are plenty of sunloungers available! Picturesque turquoise waters and soft white sand!!! And it's only a 5 MINUTE STROLL!!! Overall we had a lovely time here and it's a great place to stay as it is only a few minutes taxi ride away from Playa del Carmen at a cost of 70 pesos...about $7 or \u00a34 (I think)!!! This resort is not a 5 star but given the location, staff, setting and rooms I would say it is a 4 star, the food is the main let down here!!!

The transfers from the airport are good once you got through Cancun Airport. The reception staff are really good and speak great english. You also get a nice fruity drink whilst checking in.

Just beware dont feed them otherwise you will be surrounded by the coatis. They have cute little babies with them which kept us entertained for hours. the hotel staff from reception to hte room maids are fantastic. Nothing too much trouble. You get lovely towel art on your beds each day. The entertainment staff and brilliant, although if you don't want to join in they dont pressure you. The shows are good quality too. The disco is a bit of an eyeopener, guests from the other Riu's come at around 11pm to go and have some fun. Watch out for the cougers hysterical. The bar staff are really quick and people say the drinks are watered down, (just dont have ice). The First Choice reps are good take some marmite for Tessa anf Lads mags for Andy. The only thing i can critise is no kettle for your morning coffee, take a thermos mug and the sports bar will make them for you. Playa del Carmen, is ok We had a lovely meal at the Casa Del Aqua a bit pricey but for a special occasion was nice. Beware of the Sin Khan jungle trip.

They were too busy trying to sell film packages than sell drinks and the plane food was terrible - a sugared donut for a Childs breakfast!!! The hotel staff were great especially the childrens entertainment team. Even though my son was too young to join in the childrens club as he was 2, he still joined in on stage at night. People have moaned about the food, but I always found something to eat. There was always pizza, pasta, chips,salad as well as different themed nights. The steak house was great and we went about 3 times. Whilst this hotel isn't on the beach you can't moan at the walk to e beach. There is a golf buggy that can take you there but this stops over lunch time, but to be honest we felt that it was nice stroll and it was a shaded path. The rooms are a Mexican style and I couldn't fault the cleanliness. The only downside was that the bed was a double pushed together which meant our son would slip between the two. The sea was quite rough but we went in and had fun jumping the waves. We went to the Yucutan for lunch but thought that our own hotel was better.

Unfortunately, when we arrived at Cancun Airport, the rain was so heavy I didn't want to get off the plane, this weather stayed for the next couple of days - very heavy prolonged rain. Of our 10 days, we had 4/5 days of sunshine, the others were overcast or rainy - not just 10 minutes showers as we believed! Anyway, this was not the hotels fault.......they even provided great big umbrellas. The hotel is gorgeous, surroundings are so green with lots of coatimundi animals running everywhere, they are so cute and love bananas! There are also 2 iguanas we saw every day we were at the pool. The pool is great and if you like pool games, the entertainment team are wonderful, no pressure to join in at all, if you feel like lying in the sun that is fine. The entertainment at night was not really our taste but could be funny (probably not meant to be!). We went to the night club - good if you like a late night and also used the Sports Bar - computer is 40 pesos (about \u00a32) for 15 minutes. We did the Thomson bar crawl and trip to Coco Bongos - not to be missed, I have never seen anything like it! We booked a trip to see/swim dolpins before we left, we booked with DT Traveller, the trip was to Dolphin Discovery and was on $148 US dollars, about half the price of any others we seen advertised. The Thomson reps at the resort are very helpful. Also, please note, there is a 'swap box' at the Thomson desk, it has shampoo, conditioner, sun lotion etc - people put in at the end of their hols - great if you run out with a just a couple of days to go.

The hotel is very clean and the staff are really friendly and so much fun, you get a sense they really want you to enjoy your holiday. Not being on the beachside is not an issue as it is so easy to get to the beach and you have use of the sister hotels when you are there. The 24/7 all inclusive really is just that. You can literally eat and drink all day and all night if you want to. They also have branded spirits available on request and they are definitely not watered down as some reviews might suggest! Stay away from the wine though, its quite vile. The staff are excellent but if you want to get served quickly during busy spells at night it's worth tipping and they won't forget you. The sports bar and 'nightclub' are in this hotel so it gets busy at night with guests from sister hotels but not in an intrusive way. The minibar is filled up every 2nd day and if you prefer diet pepsi to sprite just write them a little note and they'll oblige. Now for the downsides and the reason its not 'amazing' and not quite what I'd expect from a 5star. The room is very dated. It did smell slightly damp and there was no light in the shower. The beds were really uncomfortable, I like a hard bed but this was extreme. The corridors were also really noisy. I understand the hotel can't control people shouting etc but mainly it was doors slamming really hard which surley could've been controlled by door closers? Also you don't get into all the RIu hotels as you might think, which I feel is a bit odd. We only wanted to walk through one of them from the beach and thats how we found out we were not allowed! The Asian restaurant really is bad and the steak restaurant is only ok. We stuck to the buffet after trying both of these. Obviously the buffet is going to get boring and repetitive over two weeks but thats the choice you make by going all inclusive surely. The food was a lot better than other all inclusives I've stayed in. I'd also advise anyone if booking trips through Thomas Cook etc don't bother with the dolphin training, it extortionate and you can swim with dolphins elsewhere. Xel-Ha is amazing and if you go for the whole day, its all inclusive once your in and you can pay extra to swim with dolphins or manitees, which you would definitely have time for. We also went to the Mayan Temples which was really interesting and definately worth a visit. I'd also advise people not to go over christmas and new year. The hotel do very little to celebrate the occassions and you pay almost double what you'd pay any other time of the year. In conclusion we had a brilliant time, we definitely made the best of it but I wouldn't recommend this hotel to friends unless they were getting a great deal and I think for the price we paid we could have been in a far superior resort in Mexico.", "Date": "July 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGreat location and entertainment\u201d", "Author": "Princesskathmc", "ReviewID": "UR114879007", "Content": "Typical Riu.

There were little kids everywhere and the hotel staff seemed to have tons of activities for the kids. Since we do not have kids, I wish I had picked an adults-only resort so that the pool area was a bit more quiet and relaxing. The food was just okay. A lot of things were gross (asian restaurant), but I was always able to find something to eat. The guacamole for lunch and dinner was fantastic. The drinks were pretty bad. I really wanted to drink pina coladas all week, but they were so runny and the ice was the wrong texture, it was just not a good pina colada. I found all the blended drinks to be this way, and I ended up drinking sprite and beer all week. This hotel is an easy 20 minute walk to town, which was great. It was very very clean. It fit our budget at this time and I'm happy we went. However, next time I would pay more money to stay in a place that's a bit more luxurious, has better food, and is not so large! Pros: Location, beach, staff, cleanliness Cons: Food, loud at pool, too many people, entertainment was sub-par, bad drinks Tips: Do not worry about the fact that this hotel is not right on the beach. It is an easy 5 minute walk. Bring big mugs for cold drinks on the beach. Bring water shoes if you plan to go to Xel Ha, which was awesome! If you go to Tulum, go in the morning when it's not so hot.

We chose this hotel based on recommendations from family about the riu chain. They had been to the Yucatan but we decided on the Tequila based on trip advisor reviews. Reception and all staff in general: All were brilliant and very helpful. Always happy and did their best to make sure everything was perfect. Especially the cleaners who were constantly working hard, I\u2019ve never been to such a clean hotel! Food: The food was quite good similar to other all inclusive hotels we have visited in the Caribbean. Not quite as good as there was less variety. The steak restaurant was nice but a bit too salty for me. The Asian and Mexican restaurants are pointless and a waste of time as they\u2019re self serve buffets and the main restaurant is themed as Asian one night of the week and Mexican another providing the exact same menu as in the booking restaurants. The pasta station in the main buffet is always a good option and Fernando who serves it is really nice. Also only the pool restaurant served lunch which meant it often got busy and there were fewer options than we have experienced on other holidays. We aren\u2019t saying the food was bad it was mainly pretty good but we think the Riu hotels need to make improvements to be comparable to its competitors. Drinks: The drinks were a big let down. All the spirits were watered down in all the riu hotels in the area. They were very weak unless you happened to be ordering when a new bottle was being opened. There were some nice non-alcoholic cocktails mainly banana mamas and pina colada. However, these few cocktails got boring by the end of our second week. The only drink that was nice and not watered down was the beer. Again the riu chain needs to improve on this. Pool: The pools were nice one either side of the lunch buffet. Not very deep but some nice features. Room: The rooms were excellent, cleaned daily. We had a room facing the fence of the hotel but this was nice as we had daily visits from the coatis. Beach: Absolutely stunning! Always plenty of sun beds some fish in the sea but if you are very interested in snorkeling I would recommend going on an excursion. Other rius: We used the facilities at both the riu yucatan and riu playacar; both were very similar to the tequila but with better locations directly on the beach. The riu yucatan was a bit to busy with too many loud brits\u2026 we go away to have a break from the uk not be constantly reminded of it. The playacar was our favourite of the three, it was quieter and had a better set up than the tequila although they don\u2019t have a 24hr sports bar. Thomson and First Choice: The reps Tessa, Gustavo and Andy were all really helpful and there when you needed them. Tessa would be grateful if you would take her a pot of marmite as she can\u2019t get it in mexico. The flight wasn\u2019t the best we have experienced there were problems with the entertainment systems on the way out and back meaning they turned it off and on several times when we had already started watching programmes. The planes are getting dated and need to be renovated. All in all we had a lovely time and you will enjoy it. For us we prefer islands that are not as commercialized such as Dominican Republic. But if you prefer somewhere with more going on and with a bit of nightlife this could be perfect for you.

The rooms were very clean and the staff were very friendly (despie what other reviews say !). Look out for veronica and Victor at the hotel bar if you tip them at the beginning of the night your glass will never get empty. The service throughout the complex was also excellent. On 2 occasions we had to report a problem in the room (blocked toilet and water leeking from vent in ceiling) and approx 90 seconds from making the call to reception there was a member of staff there and the problem resolved instantly. There is a large selection of food at the buffet restaurant but we found that after about 10 days it was very repetitive but there is plenty of choice and it doesn't differ from any other longhaul all inclusive holidays we have been previously on. The beach is beautiful and the sea is like going into a luke warm bath but please put plenty of high factor cream on as the breeze on the beech is very deceptive and my wife got burned within 2 days with factor 20 on ! We went out in the first week in June and they do average about 2 days of rain per week. We had torrential rain for 2 solid days the day after we arrived and there isn't a lot to do in the hotel when this happens apart fro hit the bar. During this time we used the Spa, they do a special deal fo couples for around 50 pound each for 80 minutes and it was fantastic.The first week was reasonably quiet but there was definite evidence of the hotel filling up with younger more lively people in the second week. The queue around the bar at night was also busier in the second week but the staff continued to work their socks off and you do get served in a few minutes. Try the mexican flag shot and mudslide cocktail they are gorgeous. Surprisingly the hotel does not have coronna or sol but this other lager that you can drink all evening but not feel the effects at all. The same lager is served in bottles in your room fridge apears to taste much better. There is a show every night on the big stage but I didn't rate it. There is also a sports bar with about 12 TV's in it but they serve drinks in plastic glasses that smell horrible so I stayed away from it. We spent a night in Playa del Carma and had a meal for a change (Highly recommend the BLUE LOBSTER steak and seafood house). I would certainly recommend this as it breaks an almost cemented routine revolving around restaurants and pool or beach and then bar/show. The prices on the main strip are around the same as here in the UK but the cocktails (4 pound) are much better and larger. The lager is bud, corona, or Sol for around 3 pound but you can ask locals where their preferred bars are and get them cheaper. We flew with Thompson and they were ok. The trips are very over priced through them, for example we priced up deep sea fishing with them for 4 hours with 4 people sharing a boat and they charged us around 60 pounds per person. There is a hut next to the pool (scuba caribe) that gave us a boat for 8 hours and we had sole control of the boat and we could ask the captain to go to snorkal at a local reef for the same price so be careful. If you want to take the other trips there are some local shops down the road from the hotel with a hut that sells the same trips at a cheaper price as well so its definitely wise to look around. If its any conselation we caught nothing on our fishing trip but went to a local coral reef and were there all on her own and saw turtles and a stingray ! . We did book a half day catamaran trip with the rep as it went daily and we booked at the last minute. It was an excellent trip and we also went to a reef to snorkel and seen turtles. We also went to a lagoon and put life jackets on and drank beer in crystal clear waters ! All in All this was a very good holiday. The staff were very friendly and always working hard at something. If you are planning to go in the next few weeks the hotel was definitely filling up with younger couples and it was much more loud and lively both at the pool and bars in the evening. Take plenty of high factor cream. At nighttime it was very humid and even whilst I was there 2 people fainted at the bar with exhaustion (though i felt it may have been the drink). Drink plenty of water on a regular basis. Watch the showers in the rooms there is a nasty step into them and children may slip (use the handrail). Also there is no coffee or tea making facilities in the room so a travel kettle is a worthwhile investment and will make other residents jelous.", "Date": "June 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seoul", "Title": "\u201cComparing this Hotel in PDC to Iberostar Cozumel\u201d", "Author": "phlip0830", "ReviewID": "UR113829095", "Content": "Just been in two all-inclusive, Spanish founded resorts near Cancun : The Iberostar Cozumel in Cozumel Island and Riu Tequila in Playa Del Carmen, the opposite side of Cozumel Island. They both are all-inclusive resorts. But they showed an extreme contrast. I will compare them in detail. (FYI, we paid almost same price for these hotels.) <Riu Tequila> Good: Show and Entertainment, Beach. Its entertainment team does good job. Even though casino is prohibited in this area, they opened \"no cash\" casino to entertain guests. They also had a decent show for every night. Beach is, I think, better than that of Cancun hotel area. More shades by trees are provided and very peaceful. Even though this resort, located opposite side of shore does not have beach itself, people can reach and use its sister Riu hotel beaches by 5 minutes walk or cart service. Bad : Garden, building, Food, Staffs, and Snorkeling. Its garden has no domestic animal and was not well cared compared to Iberostar Cozumel. Building are outdated and lacks style or elegance. (Room was more spacious, though) The most serious problem was food. Even though its Asian specialty restaurant was good, other buffet foods were below average and most items were repeated for several days. (See the detail in Iberostar part below) Staffs, compared to Iberostar, were lacking smile and kindness a little. No Snorkeling - you should pay and take boat to near Cozumel to enjoy watching fishes. It costs $40 for a person. <Iberostar Cozumel> Good : Garden, building, Food, staffs and Snorkeling. This resort's atmosphere was an wonder itself. Its garden was very beautiful and full of animals: Iguana, Flamingos, Peacocks, Parrots, and Turtles. The trip from the room to the dinner restaurant has always been a pleasure for my son. He found new animal in every trip. Building was also beautiful. Each building consists of 14 rooms, which gives you the sense of staying in the hut located in the middle of jungle, not in the large-scale lousy resorts. (Especially Cancun areas) Food was quite good, especially desserts are apparently excellent. We did not know their food was that good till we left there and moved to Riu. Riu need better chefs(especially the desert chef, which I think they do not have or fire immediately), more variety in items, and the better ingredients. Staffs were friendly and kind. Obviously well trained to keep smile in any situations. Snorkel was possible without riding a boat. The beach in front of the hotel was full of fishes. My family made another trip for Snorkeling and it was a mistake. There was nothing new in that paid snorkeling trip. Bad: Show and Entertainment, Beach. It is obviously a resort for calm rest. No great entertainment was provided during day and night. Kids club was almost nothing. The show theatre was under repair. Cozumel Island does not have good sand beach. Sands are accumulating on the other side, Cancun and PDC. Though it has a small sand area (I think it was artificial), when you enter the water, the bottom becomes feet soring reef. You should not expect the beautiful beach of Cancun or Playa del Carmen. --------- One last interesting contrast was the nationality of the guests. 90% of Guests in Iberostar Cozumel were American while 90% of them in Riu were Europeans and Latin Americans. Both have almost no Asian or (American) African, which can be seen easily in Cancun. The other contributor provided (very good) explanation on this contrast of guest composition: Cozumel does not have direct filght from Europe and the ferry schedule from Cancun/PDC to Cozumel is not favorable for them while Europeans does not like lousy atmosphere of Cancun. So, it can be said that Cancun is mostly filled with Americans who want cool and noisy party while PDC is for more modest Europeans and Cozumel is for \"exceptional\" Americans who want silence and rest (or serious divers)", "Date": "June 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lowell, Michigan", "Title": "\u201cHome away from home\u201d", "Author": "Braileys", "ReviewID": "UR113439819", "Content": "My husband and I have returned to the Tequila 6 times in the past 6 years.

The swim up bar is the largest and nicest I have ever seen! The service is exceptional and the cleanliness is a pleasant suprise. We always request a room over looking the golf course and enjoy watching the golfers while relaxing on the private balcony. We have also stayed at the Riu Yucatan and enjoy it also as it is directly on the ocean. But the feeling of the Tequila outweighs the fact that it is accross the road from the ocean and the constant shuttle service is only a few minutes ride to the beach. As a guest of the Riu resorts, you can explore several other such as the Lupita and the Playa Car and have full use of all the amenities.

Although the flight was very long, I was impressed with the legroom on the flight- and me and my husband are both tall. The transfer was easy to the hotel and check in was very quick. The hotel was very clean and constantly maintained. Our room was spotless and the minibar was always full of drinks. We also loved the variety of towel animals left on the bed- well worth the tip! The pools are large and we always managed to get a sunbed ok. The pool area was very busy everyday which gave it a good atmosphere- but also found it hard to relax some times. There was lots of shade in the pool area. The beach was AMAZING! A short walk, but we used the beach club for lunch and the yucatan pool and bar. Although the yucatan was on the beach- there seemed to be a lot more large young groups and it seemed quite lively there. The water was clear and the sand soft and white. The food was good in all the restaurants. We ate in the steak house, mexican and asian twice each during our stay and enjoyed them very much. The food in the buffet restaurant had a lot of variety- but (and this is the only fault i have with the hotel) the tables were two close together and made us feel a little uncomfortable. It was fine if you were more than 2 people as tables were pushed together but with couples you were eating close to others. Mexican night and italian night were very good though. The entertainment team were always around all day, but they werent pushy if you didnt want to get involved. The shows in the evening were great light entertainment while you worked your way through the cocktail menu at the bar. There was also free wifi in the lobby, Thomson reps seemed to be there all the time. We booked two trips with thompson- Xel-ha and Dolphin swim via catamaran. Xel-ha was a brilliant day which I highly recommend. You can snorkel all day and see loads of fish and stingrays etc in a natural aquarium. It was all inclusive and the food was great. We also did the isla mujejes tour which was a catamaran to the island and then dolphin swimming- one of the best days ive ever had and the team really looked after you all day. Overall we had a great holiday and would defiantly go back- there is something for every one here- young, old, families, couples and groups.", "Date": "June 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Newcastle", "Title": "\u201cBest all inclusive hotel we've experienced.\u201d", "Author": "newcastlepuggy", "ReviewID": "UR112969965", "Content": "This hotel is amazing, the staff are excellent and can't do enough to help. We tipped the staff but they didn't expect it unlike the Barcelo costa cancun where you were ignored unless you constantly tipped. This hotel has a friendly, relaxed vibe and I felt at home immediatley. The food quality and range is superb. There is a buffet restaurant which has a different theme every evening, a Chinese, A Mexican and steak house. You have to book a table for the latter three restaurants. The staff constantly top your drink up and clear your table. The rooms were kept exceptionally clean and our cleaner left us a different towel art sculpture every day. The bar staff are awesome. Especially paulina who serves you immediatley, coordinating several orders at once. The entertainment team are very good and ensured noone was bored day or night. Crazy James was our favourite. He made all nationalities laugh and smile with his infectious personality. We loved felix in the steakhouse, his unassuming manner was refreshing and he couldn't do enough to help. The beach is a 5-10 minute walk along a walkway or a golf buggy will transport those who prefer not to walk. Whilst on the beach a waiter brings trays of drinks over or you can use the nearby beach restaurant or pool bar. You can use the gym at the riu opposite which is a 5 minute walk maximum. The gym has everything you need to burn off some of those extra calories consumed. The gym does have a fan but as you can imagine it gets quite hot. We will definatley return to this gem of a hotel.

The rooms are bright and you will almost always be greeted by a friendly towel aminal! All of the main areas of the hotel are kept clean throughout the day and there is always someone on hand if you need anything, whether it be a member of the Riu team or the Resort Rep. The food within the hotel was excellant and varied. We ate in the main restaurant, the Asian and the Steakhouse and all are worth a visit. As in our previous visits, the staff are exceptional, always have a cheery face and nothing is too much trouble. We didn't do any trips this time via our Rep however we did take the local bus up to Cancun which was both good value and easy to do. We took a taxi to 5th Avenue (70 pesos) and then the local ADO bus from the Playa del Carmen Bus Station to Cancun Bus Station (80 pesos each return).

This is an amazing beautiful place and we wish we were still there. This is quite a lengthy review, but if you are like me and want to know every little detail because you are unsure then carry on reading!!! Flight: We left on time both ways, cabin crew very friendly and obliging. Comfy leather seats with more leg room than usual, seats are positioned 2,3,2. Food was much better than the normal plane food and was actually not bad! Have to buy your own drinks as these not included. 3 out of the 4 loos were blocked on way to Cancun, not good when you have young kids! Landed early both ways. Cancun Airport: Straight off plane into airport, follow signs for imigration, bags were already on carousel, queued for about 20 min to have our visa stamped and then through bag check area, press a button and a green or red light appears, green means ok carry on through, red means stop and they undo all your luggage! (We were lucky and got green)! Follow ramp towards coaches, ignore all porters who ask to carry your cases, Thompson Rep is waiting and shows you to your coach. We waited about 25 mins for everyone to board the coach and then we were off! Hotel: Hotel is in a very secure 2.5mile complex, you are not allowed in without wristbands and drivers have to hand in their drivers licence before they can proceed. I had a few reservations as we were driving from Cancun, but as soon as we arrived at the hotel I felt very relieved and comfortable with my surroundings! The driver unloads your cases and you have to check in at reception for key, wristbands and details, they give you some stickers with room number on which you need to put on your case, the porters then take all your luggage to your room, ours arrived within 5 mins of us finding our room. A lovely big open lobby with open air and indoor seats, free wi-fi and Thompson Reps in corner. Rooms: Quite large rooms with 2 double beds, they are quite hard but we asked for 2 mattress toppers which were made up while we went for our dinner and they were more than happy to oblige. 2 bedside cabinets with drawers, 2 big chest of drawers, clock, phone, table & chairs, air con! Patio doors with mosquitoe door leads to large balcony with patio furniture overlooking beautiul gardens. Bathroom was large, with sink, shower, toilet (with door), fridge, drinks optics and huge wardrobe with lots of hangers, electronic safe. Fridge is topped every two days with coke, 7 up, fanta and beer! Sheets were changed daily and the room was spotless, the maid service was great we couldnt find anything to complain about ( I had read other reviews who said it was awful), tv not a flat screen as some people have moaned about, (we didnt even switch it on in 3 weeks, I dont travel to Caribbean to watch tv)!! Pool: Two lovely large pools, one with swim up bar, the other which we went to had activities going on throughout the day - volley ball, pool volley ball, water polo, basket ball, shuffle board, horseshoe, darts, water areobics, stretching, spanish lessons, bingo - they dont pressure you in to doing the activites but let you know when they are on! Both pools have built in sun water chairs! Cleaners always around pool sweeping up, removing cups, clearing leaves from pool. Water bit chilly first thing in morning but soon got warm and we spent a lot of time cooling down! Very clean water, it did get a little cloudy at end of day sometimes, but thats expected with drinks and suncream/oils, definately not dirty as others have said. Beach: This is amazing and so beautiful. Miles of hot white sand, beautiful turquoise water some days very calm others a little choppy but still accessable, very warm and crystal clear. If you have little kids just watch as it does drop suddenly from ankle depth to knee then waist height but then is the same depth for quite a way! Lots of loungers and plenty of shade under palm trees if you need it, it had a lovely warm breeze by the waters edge which was quite a relief! We usually walked to the Playa-Car Hotel about 2 mins to the left of our hotel and onto beach there as it was not as busy and quieter and also food seemed nicer than at the Yuckatan, just a personal preference. Riu beach activity huts by both hotels, read a safety statement sign a form and have wristband stamped and you can use the water equipment, you can only use cats and wind surfs if you know how to use them. A BIG word of WARNING - please be careful on kayaks - we used them on several occasions and had a wonderful time - but the last time we used them there was a strong undercurrent and my eldest daughter & friend drifted 1km up the beach and had to be rescued by a jet ski, at the same time myself and my youngest daughter were pushed in towards shore and were tipped over by wave, the kayak hit my daughters head and split it open, she had to see Dr at Yuckatan who charged $120 to look at her and then we had to go to Hospiten where they put 7 stitches in and charged $1771, fortunately we were insured. Not to put anyone off, we had great fun in them but they are undpredictable! You can use pools at both PlayaCar and Yuckatan Hotels. Golf buggy runs every 10 mins to beach, although it is only about a 5 min walk down a lovely shaded walkway! If you walk 10 mins to right of Yuckatan past hotels its a very quiet beach but it does end up on a nudist beach so we turned around quick!! If you walk to the left of Yuckatan then you can walk in to Playa-Del-Carmen! Food: Plenty of lovely presented food, lots of choice for all. A different theme each night although there was always a pasta station, pitza station and kids station. Lots of fresh fruit, gateux. Breakfast, omlette station, cooked breakfast, continental breakfast, fruit juices, teas, coffees, fresh fruit, cereal, yoghurts. The waiters are all fantastic especially Cha Cha, Rangel and Edgar, nothing is too much trouble for them, it was my birthday and Cha Cha arranged a table for our family and friends and ordered steaks for us all, decorated a table, carved a bird from a melon, brought me a birthday cake and all sang Happy Birthday in Spanish!! The maids decorated my room with balloons, made a cake from towel art, left a card and little gift, they really made my birthday special! I went on the kitchen tour the day before we left and it was spotlessly clean. Steak house is nice, steaks are ok, not the best but made a change! Didnt use Asian or Mexican but people said they were ok. We didnt have to queue at all to reserve speciality restaurant, although I would think in busy times you would have to! Reception: They were very helpful and went out of there way to help you with any issues, whatever was asked was sorted straight away, very polite and friendly, nothing was to much trouble. Entertainment: They made our holiday, the kids loved them all they are so friendly and funny and work tirelessly all day and evening! The shows are brilliant and funny (some people have said they are ameraterish) - we are in a holiday complex not in West End or Vegas- and I thought they were fantastic much better then the usual holiday entertainment. Grease and Mamma Mia were our favouites! Bars: Never had to wait long for a drink and there are lots to choose from! My fav was Blue Oceon, Miami Vice and if you want non-alcoholic ask for Tropical Pick Me Up or Shirley Temple!! Shopping: There is a small plaza 100m from hotel, price not too bad although compare shops before you buy! Playa-Del-Carmen is about 30min walk or 10min in taxi (70 Peso) but you get hassled everytime you look at a shop which was a shame as it put us off. There are street vendors in the hotel every other night selling goods, whatever price they offer you take half off and you are near the price its worth!! We worked our pesos out like this - eg: 200 peso, half it = 100 peso and take the last zero off = \u00a310 give or take a few pence, this is working on 20peso to GBP, even though its about 17.5peso to GBP, but was easy way of working everthing out!! Towels: You get a towel card per person which you swap for a pool towel, when finished you give towel in and get card back. (No card, no towel) $20 dollar if its lost so dont lose it! Reps: Tess & Andy are fantastic, they will help if they can in anyway. Full of knowlege about trips. We did the Dolphin Sensation (Isla Mujures) \u00a380ish per person, got picked up at 7.10am taken to Cancun, boarded a catamaran about an hour to reef and an hours snorkelling, hours shopping on island, back on catamaran to dolpinarium, free food and drink all day,. 45 mins with dolphins then rest of afternoon around dolphinarium, back on catamaran hour back to Cancun then coach back to hotel, we arrived at hotel at 8.30pm, tired but had the best day of our lives!! I hope this review helps anybody who is going to Tequila, please get in touch if you need any further information and I will be happy to reply! I am really envious of anybody going, we cant wait to go back!

Never did the mexican as we did not like it last time. Entertainment was pretty good as well. The staff did a good job. Enjoyed our night at CocoBongo for sure! Grounds are really pretty. Very nice jungle setting, with animals everywhere. Lots of walking, but we enjoy that with all the eating and drinking going on. Swim up bar in the pool had lots of action all day. The place was 90% european at least this year. Not that that is bad or good. We enjoy getting to know people all around the world. Pretty much a working class group of visitors in my mind. Our kind of peeps, lol. WiFi works well in the lobby only. There really are no negatives at the Tequila. Its a nice 3 star budget resort in my mind. Did the Coba excursion with alltournative tours.

Upon our arrival we were allocated our room which was in block 19 which is situated towards the rear of the complex. This was fine for us as it was quiet and peaceful away from the pool and main entertainment areas. We had a downstairs room (1908) which was equiped with everything a couple would need for a two week stay (hairdyer, iron, ironing board, safe, optics full of booze!!! Etc etc...) After settling in we went out for a walk to get our bearings. The complex is a large one and has the following: large pool either side of the lunchtime restaurant/steakhouse restaurant. This also houses a swim up bar and a bar you can sit around until midnight. The main restaurant is situated in the main buildings off the lobby. The food is varied and excellent and i never struggled to find something i liked. You seat yourselves during breakfast and your are taken to a table by amember of staff in the evening. (but if you are not happy with the table they take you to just tell them and they will find one you do like). You also have the choice of eating inside or out. We found that inside it feels a bit cramped thus we ate outside where you had more room and a nicer feel but again it's your choice. The amin entertainment is staged off the lobby on a large stage with plenty of seating around. This is where most people head to of an evening after their meal. It has twp bars, plus a nightclub situated inside a buolding which looks like a church. This opens around half eleven/midnight and is good if you have had a few and fancy a late nig boogie. This is also a sports bar off the entertainment area which is the only 24 hour bar. This is air conditioned and full of pool tables, air hockey and tv's for the footy. Watched villa win and blues get relegated in their it was awesome!! The beach is about a 5/10minute walk away depending how fast you walk. There is also a larger golf cart buggie that is constantly picking up and dropping off should you wish to use it. If you come out of the hotel and cross the road there is a long pathway leading directly to the beach. Beach is really nice and long. We enjoyed taking walks along it towards playa del carmen. The sea was a little choppy when we were there but not enough to put us off going in. The great bonus (in our opinion) of staying at a Riu is that you can also use your wristbands for the all inclusive in the sister hotels on the resort. If you stay at the tequila you are allowed to use the playacar, yucatan and the lupita (the lupita is a bit further away than the others). This is great as the yucatan and playacar are situated on the beach. The staff at all the hotels are great and i cannot fault them. We did a few trips whilst we were there to Chichen Itza (\u00a374 pp) and Xel Ha (\u00a366 pp). Both on the pricy side but both enjoyable days. Chichen Itza is a long way (well for us brits it is - 3 hours on a coach) but when there is a wonder of the world on your doorstep i feel you have to go. We got chatting to another older couple who told us about akumal beach aka turtle beach. We decided to try it. There are trips here but again they are pricy. We got a taxi form the hotel (\u00a318) and did it ourselves. The beach here is amazing and if you like snorkelling you only have to swim out 50yards and you find the turtles! My partner is not a great swimmer so she got a lifejacket. These are great for this and gave her the confidence to swim out. It's not deep (8ft max). This was our favourite day and if you do antthing away from the resort i would definately reccommend this. In summary it was a great 2 weeks and great value for money. We are not big drinkers but we felt like we had our monies worrh after the first week!! Having spoilt ourselves somewhat last year visiting he maldives we were worried that anywhere else would be a let down but it wasn't. If you want peace and traquillity the riu's are not for you - go to the maldives!!! But if you want value for money, entertainment and a family holiday this is spot on.

It is immaculate, set in absolutley stunning surroundings, and the staff are some of the friendliest people I have ever met. My son loved walking past everyone and saying 'Hola'! Everyone said hello, and looked genuine in doing so too. They really could not do enough for you. Our hotel room backed on to the trees and gardens, but this was lovely as it was nice and quiet. We were entertained daily by the animals that lived around the hotel. So cute and they loved a bit of fruit or chocolate muffin! The rooms were cleaned daily. We took full use of the optics and drinks in the fridge, and also there was an ice machine in each block of rooms. When we arrived the first night we asked for a camp bed to be put in our room for our son, it was done straight away. There was always something to eat. We were there 2 weeks and we found the food absolutley fine. Dont get me wrong, it wasnt Michelin Star quality, but it was all tasty, well prepared and there lots of choice, even for my fussy son! We never encountered any problems booking into the restaurants. The pool area was nice and clean, but we spent most of our time down at the beach. The breeze was very welcome! Make sure you get a good factor suncream. I put Factor 50 on my son on the first day, Factor 30 on us and we all burnt - i rarely burn. In the shops they have over Factor 100! The beach is like something from a postcard. So so beautiful. There were always sunbeds and the waves in the sea are loads of fun. I had a massage on the beach and it was fantastic. They will offer you a free five minutes to entice you in - its worth it. The walkway down to the beach was nice and shaded by the trees so was quite pleasant, but if you felt lazy there was a golf buggy running up and down all day. We used the restaurant down at the Yucatan at lunch time and it was absolutley fine. The shows were good fun at night time. They really do make an effort. My son took part in the Lion King show and loved it! Playa Del Carmen in general is a lovely town. We made our own way by taxi into the town and booked our trips there. We swam with the dolphins Dolphinaris (lots of dolphin experiences about, but this one is a conservational area) and also went to XCaret which was a very long, but fantastic day out. We saw soooo many different animals and it was just beautiful there. The only thing it would say is to be careful to not get ripped off with the exchange rate. We did, but we would still go back tomorrow!

We thought the food was AMAZING I can't believe some people on here have actually said the food isn't that good - I really don't know what planet they're from!! The buffet at dinner was varied every night and we really enjoyed the steak house, mexican and asian restaurant. SO much to choose from. We really enjoyed it around the pool bar, they serve loads of cocktails it was difficult to tear my husband away! Was sometimes hard to get a sunbed by the pool if you leave it too late but most days was ok. We made quite a few friends on our stay it was a lovely atmosphere around the pool during the day. The beach is a short walk away or you can get the beach buggy...beach is beautiful. The staff seem to be working their butts off all day...They definetely deserve and appreciate any tips. We went to Coco Bongo's it was BRILLIANT best night out EVER. We didn't go with Thompson though, went anlong with the animation team after the show at night (50 dollars but all drinks included - WELL worth it!). If you go with Thompson you have to leave Coco's early so I wouldn't advise going with them). Only other thing we did was Xel-ha ecopark (through thompson) which was 99 dollars each. i think this was a bit of a rip-off to be honest but it was a nice day out. We payed extra here to swim with dolphins (Primax) but again this was very expensive and so are the photos afterwards. But it's something we haven't done before.

We were grateful of being able to use the facilities at the 2 Riu hotels on the beach but Tequila was the best and the free WiFi in the lobby was an unexpected bonus. Our only concern before leaving was whether the weather was going to be too hot and how we would cope with the long flight. The flight was extremely long and the jet lag did take a few days to wear off, but the seat was comfortable with plenty of leg room, there was plenty to entertain us on the plane and it was worth it once we had recovered. It was extremely warm and high factor sun lotion was needed, but because the resort (Playacar) is so well thought out, it wasn't unbearable. There was shade from palm trees everywhere we went within Playacar and the air conditioning kept the room at a bearable temperature too. We found it too hot to sunbathe around the pool area, however there is plenty of shade around the pool if you don't want to sun bathe. We chose to sunbathe at the beach instead where there was a bit of a warm breeze. We never had trouble finding a sun bed on the beach or around the pool on the few days we did stay around the pool and we generally didn't head down there until around 11am. The pool bar was very close to the beach, so popping there for a drink regularly was no hassle and kept us nice and refreshed all day. The sea amazing, it was so warm it was just like walking in to a bath and the all inclusive water sports were great fun. The rooms were well kept, clean and nicely decorated. Everywhere in the hotel was clean, comfortable and well decorated. The people and staff were extremely friendly and helpful. The pool area is lovely and the swim up bar was great. The food was lovely and there was plenty of variety in the restaurants, snack bar and drinks bar. The 3 speciality restaurants (Asian, Steak and Mexican) were fantastic and we never had trouble booking in, even when we left it until 9.30am to book. We chose to go on a couple of day trips, one of them was the Speed boat Jungle tour from Cancun, which was one of the highlights of the whole holiday, it was fantastic. After driving our own speedboat to a reef we snorkelled there for around 40 mins and saw some absolutely amazing sights, thousands of fish in every shape, size and colour you can imagine.

My wife and I had a GREAT time! The beaches are beautiful, the staff and service was excellent, and the food was much better than I expected. The room was not elaborate, but very clean and quite roomy, and it came with liquor dispensers and a stocked frig. We did have a problem with our refrigerator (no temp controls on it), and I called the front desk to have them look at it. It did take two calls (as the first time they said it was working properly), but the next time we came back to the room everything in it was ice cold. Problem solved. I will say the drinks at the pool are definitely watered-down, so if you like to drink, you may want to do it in your room before hitting the pool/beach. For us, we spent most of our time at the beach (15 minute walk from our room). The gulf water was crystal clear, perfect temperature, and the beach always had a nice breeze. There was always plenty of beach lounge chairs available and shade under palm trees when needed (like on Day 2). Weather was beautiful for our trip, no clouds, no rain, just perfect blue skies and mid-80 deg. weather. We did do a couple's message at the Yucatan (adjacent Riu hotel) spa, which was very nice. A little pricey, but was worth it, IMO. We did not use a private transfer, just the Riu shuttle service (thru HotelBeds). They met us at the airport, and after waiting 15 minutes for other people on their list to show up (they never did), they put us on another shuttle with other people and off we went. We were the second stop, so total time from arriving at the Cancun airport to arriving at hotel was about 2 hours. Not bad in my opinion (and we saved $100+ by not using a private transfer). When we arrived, we met with Ael who scheduled our return pickup appt, gave us info on the hotel and excursions, and was great to talk to. I will say getting back to the airport sucked only because we had to be ready 4 hours before our flight left, and that meant getting picked up at 3:40am! I don't think I will schedule another 7:40am return flight next time. I will say that I would definitely stay at the Tequila again! It was cheaper than staying right on the beach, I liked the restaurants and pool there better than at the Playacar and Yucatan, and the night shows were a lot of fun.

Rooms are HUGE esp for 2 ppl, they contain two double beds (pushed together to make a huge one) not always the most romantic as instead of sharing one we had a bed each lol. Bathroom area is divided by a curtain with optics, fridge with beer, soft drinks and mixers, the toilet has a door and the shower area just has a shower curtain, some reveiws complain there is no light in the shower (which there isn't) its not like it pitch black its just darker than the lighted part of the bathroom, tip open the curtain its not rocket science lol... Rooms are a bit dated but spotlessly cleaned every day, food is plentiful, and l am prob one of the worlds fussiest eaters and always found something decent to eat. The beach is gorgeous, didnt spend much time at the pool as it can get a little rowdy at times and the pool water can look a bit murky with all the ppl sat at the swim up bar spilling various drinks in it! The pool area is also boiling hot where at the beach you get a lovely breeze and if like me u love to sunbathe you can happily stay all day and not feel like you're being raosted, although its best to try and stick to suncreams with a decent factor to them as you really don't feel the burn till later :/ Taxi's into playa del carmen cost around \u00a33.50, and they have their own Walmart (Adsa) which if you need suncreams or shower stuff (or butter or nescafe like us brits) its loads cheaper as the shops outside the Playacar 2 mins away more than double the prices, so its worth a trip to asda at the start of your hols. Did a few trips booked with the Thomson reps they are a bit pricey, we did a dolphin swim/catamaran one which was awful, cost around \u00a386 each and you got a 40 min swim with a dolphin along with another 5 ppl, so u got around 6/7mins with it, the trip in total took 14 hours and was the longest day ever, please look around if u want to do a dolphin swim, and don't book this one, to be honest all they want u to do is buy pictures which are ridiculously priced, if you would like some gorgeous photos there is a girl who works in the hotel called Martina (she's Italian) she took some of me and my hubby and although they cost $300, what we got was amazing and the pics are stunning, we got a full story book, 92 pics on a disc and 40 actual photos as well. Coco Bongos has a brill reputation but its so busy its completely overfilled everynight with fri and sat being the worst, although i was told you can book a table which would be better. Drugs are rife in town and you will be offered cannabis, cocaine and e's, we just said no thanks and they don't push it or neither do u feel intimidated bu them. Xplor is a fabulous day out at around $99 each but its heavy going on the legs, so don't bother if u struggle waliking at all, overall l can't see why anyone cmplains about the place or the hotel.

Lots of yummy mexican dishes as well as western and plain food! Service is always very good. Same the the pool restaurant at lunch. Which turns into the Steak Al la carte in the evening.

I would like to say first that our economy flight with Thomson was very good and comfortable and it is really not worth upgrading in my opinion. Our inflight meal was one of the best I have ever had on an aeroplane. On arrival, Thomsons also did a very good job of getting us straight to our hotel without any delay and we were welcomed with a fruit cocktail and taken to our room. The room was slightly musky but otherwise perfectly satisfactory for our 11 night trip at easter. Two large beds, t.v., shower and changing area. Feeling tired and a little underwhelmed however, all that changed as soon as we got to the buffet restaurant a few hours later. In our opinion the food could not have been much better. There was a choice of just about everything you could imagine and this really suited our two fussy eaters. Soft drinks, beer and wine on taps. Cocktails flowing like running water! You couldn't really want for anything more. Breakfast was fantastic too, they cooked fresh donuts, pancakes, croissants,eggs, sausages...anything you desired. Lunch is by the pool and every day we had fresh fish and vegetables whilst the children indulged in the pizza and pasta to their hearts content. The swimming pool scene was great, a little busy and loud with the springbreakers at times but they were not offensive. We actually used the pool over the road at the Riu Playacar most days as it was quieter and let straight on to the beautiful beach. Paradise. Yes the sea is choppy but thats how we like it. The evening entertainment was really good, the dancers are brilliant. Some of the shows were a little cheesy but it suited us as the kids loved it. And if they are happy, then we are happy. i guess single guests would use the on site disco but we of course didn't. I cant fault the hotel at all. The staff are amazing. They work so hard and they are friendly and well presented. The Kids loved getting some shade in the sports hall and the chance to heat up their own hot dogs. The bar in the theatre serves the best drinks. The pina coladas are wicked. We loved the Asian restaurant too, a fantastic choice of chinese and japanese. Our weather was fabulous. Just one cloudy afternoon in 11 days. It was red hot. The only trip we did was to the Wet and Wild waterpark in Cancun. It is an hour by coach but was worth it for the kids. We actually went twice. Didn't get to see much of Cancun but people we met said it is amazing. I did feel that where we staying was a lot more suitable for us as a family and somewhat more refined. My husband and one son also did a snorkelling trip arranged through the guys on the beach and they had a good experience. All in all it was a brilliant holiday. Would we go again?

The hotel itself is superb, the service was fantastic, people all smiling and so helpful. When we arrived the room we had smelt a little damp so we asked to move and moved the next day to a fab room on 1st floor and could not be happier with it. They moved all our things and it was hassle free as the manager had promised. The food in the buffet was fantastic lots of choice and never got bored with it, first week was less quiet second week few queues but nothing too bad. Sitting outside on the patio area was much nicer if a little warmer! They had a BBQ out on the patio some nights which was stunnning. Mexican restaurant was lovely down by the beach nice to cool off with the winds and it was peaceful, mixed fajitas - yummy! Asian Bamboo was nice but freezing in there! Had some lush suishi. Lupita steak restaurant was also lovely rib eye was the best don't bother with the BBQ ribs as they were not the best. Never had to get up at 7am to book always got a table by booking by 9am. Drinks are all branded so none of this watered down rubbish. Havana Rum !! Magaritas, pina coladas were the best! Did tyr the La Pinata's Club on site one night quite interesting music but they played a mix! Mix of ages worth a giggle! It's open until 2am. The entertainment staff were funny especially Orlando! He loves himself but all good fun. James was mad loves dressing up in womens clothes. My Daughter who is 11 loved Orlando and Ivan bless her they were good looking chaps though! The beach is magificient warm sea sometimes quite choppy and a strong current but fine most of the time. Volley ball is worth a go on the beach. Plenty of activities if you like that kind of thing but no hassle if you don't, usually the same people doing it everyday so they know who to drag up! Buggy cart ran every 7 mins to beach and back but to be honest it's the height of laziness unless you have walking difficulties. My daughter loved it though! We did a trip to Tulum seen some Mayarn Ruins the guide was excellent, learnt a bit about Mexico, seen some fabulous coast line then stopped off for lunch on a quiet unspoilt beach, then went on to Akumel and swam with the turtles, sting ray and Barracudas! It was AMAZING! We also tried some Parasailing and jet ski's! Don't do parasialing if you get sea sick as it's quite choppy out there! Plus the jet ski ride to the boat was the scariest bit! LOL The flight from the UK was 10.40mins going and 8.50 returning! The shows in the evening on occasion were brilliant, mainly Grease, Mamma Mia, crazy show, all great costumes and professional dancing these people work very hard. Some more tacky nights like Karaoke, silly games on stage but it was all quite funny. I'm sure there was alot of clubbing in Playa Del Carmen going on and entertainers would organise nights out so if you are a couple lots to do. All quite safe. This holiday was everything we could have wanted and more people who complain well they'll never be pleased in my opinion, we could not find fault and will definately return in the future, if only it wasn't so far away!!

It was as if the people who own the Riu hotels had surveyed people to ask them the perfect ingredients for a holiday, and then created the Rius Tequila, Yucatan, and Playacar - they had everything you could want! all hotels had gorgeous pools, fantastic swim-up bars, beautiful grounds, lovely friendly staff, delicious food, and cocktails made for you 24 hours a day. We stayed at the Tequila, but also spent a day at the other Rius and also a day on the beach, which was only a short walk away. There is an atmosphere of fun in all the hotels, the staff work soooo hard but they also look they are having so much fun in their jobs, especially Cruz and Ricardo in the pool bar at the tequila!! we were apprehensive from reading other reviews about having difficulty getting sunbeds and dinner reservations, but I can honestly say that we never had a problem getting sun beds in any of the hotels or the beach, on any day of our holiday, and we definitely weren't getting up early. we went down about 10am and still never had an issue. we also never had a problem in the restaurants - try the mexican one on the beach - it had space every night - i think people might have been put off because it was actually located in the Yucatan hotel, but it really wasn't very far to walk and its right on the beach so you have gorgeous views of the sea whilst you're eating. I felt extremely safe walking around the playacar resort, and also in Playa del Carmen. The walk into Playa is further than you think in the heat - it took about 30 mins, so a taxi is a good idea, and only 70 pesos. if you like seafood, then definitely eat out in Playa del carmen, as the fresh seafood dishes were delicious (esp ceviche) - this was one area where the Riu Tequila didn't quite hit the mark - the food was mainly buffet style and no fresh fish or shell fish. Also try one of the beach bars in Playa after dark - Fusion is gorgeous - live music, you sit on deck chairs on the sand and its all lit by candle light. oh, and they have a good wine list!! we also did some trips - didnt fancy anything energetic like zip wires - it was just too hot! But we went to chitchen itza (no visit to the Yucatan Peninsula would be complete wihtout seeing this) and it was amazing. soooo hot there, but very atmospheric. we had a great guide too, very informative. the trip also stopped off at a cenote under ground pool which we swam in, despite how deep and cold it was - an exhilerating experience, if a little scary! Also try the snorkelling - it is supposedly included in the AI at the Riu hotels, but the sea isn't any good for snorkelling right out side the hotel, so we paid $35 each to be taken on a boat to a reef further down the coast - well worth it, we saw turtles!

While we had an amazing time, the food wasn't the best, and it was similar every night, and you have to wake up really early to make reservations for a resteraunt. We are in are 20's, so waking up at 7 wasn't always exactly an easy task. We did get to eat at the steak house one night and it was wonderful. The 24 hour food they say they have is not true, unless you count the gross sandwiches in the cooler of the sports bar they offer at night. Trust me they are really gross. The pool was wonderful. I especially liked how they had each side seperated one aimed at kids, with the activities and basketball hoop, and the other side was aimed for adults with the swim up bar. That worked out well because then there were few kids on my side when I was lounging in the pool with my drink. While I liked the pool at the Yucaton it was much more crowded, very noisy and windy. I enjoyed the pool at the Tequila the best. The beach was beautiful. While I was disapointed you don't have all those people selling you stuff like the last time I was in Mexico in Puerto Vallarta. I dealt with it, some people will probably preferre there is no beach sellers, I enjoy them. They do have people selling you stuff on your resort at night though on tables they set up around the bar area however. I was also very surprised how many topless people were at the beach. Being American I am not used to it, not complaining, but I was shocked. The walk to the beach was peaceful and only a few minutes. They have these crazy little critters and monkeys in the trees to make your walk enjoyable and amusing. The beach was a litle windy, and it was hit or miss whether the tide was strong and you were able to do water sports. So take advantage of the time when the waves are not rough. Last but not least the rooms. I thought the rooms were just fine, we stayed off the beaten path so we had more of a walk, however it was very quiet, which was nice. The bed was hard, but you will most likely get that anywhere. They cleaned our rooms every day and folded our towels into cute little animals which I thought was funny. They even organized my shoes one day when I had them thrown all over. However they do NOT screw with your stuff. I know alot of people are paranoid about hotel maids stealing there stuff, and as far as I have noticed they never stole anything. The bathroom was seperated with a curtain, which was fine because then you could still feel the fresh air in the morning when we had the patio open. The mini bar was never really re-stocked, we had to keep asking, and there is a bottle opener above the frige on the wall. We learned that the hard way after we chipped the wood on a dresser trying to open a bottle. All in all my expierence was wonderful, and I would reccomend this place to a friend. Would I go back? Yes, however I am not one to repeat my vacation so I always go somewhere different and expierence different things when I travel. However this expierence has me looking at differient Riu hotels in different cities for my next vacation.

I am noticing by reading past reviews that the British reviewers are happier with the hotel than the American reviewers. Not sure if we're just pickier, or just like to complain more. I found this hotel to be the most economical of its kind in the area, considering the deal we got of \"kids stay free.\" Not sure it would be totally worth it next year, if we had to pay for our teenager. Food: I think the food could be the best part of the resort. I have stayed at Bahia Principe Coba, like the past reviewer, and while that resort is probably nicer, I feel that not as much care went into food preparation, and variety. It was obvious that hot foods were kept hot, and cold were kept cold, and items were replenished in a timely manner. The specialty restaurant of Japanese is worth it if only to get out of the \"din\" of the larger main dining room, which can be irritating after a while. Room: Adequate. Beds, hard and have plastic sheeting to protest them, so moving around produces irritating sounds. We requested an extra cot, which was brought promptly. Shower: 5 out of a 10 for low water pressure, and a little dark. Nice that toilet has itsown little room, but it could use a fan for ventilation. If you want to compare it to Bahia Principe Coba, the Coba wins hands down, but it's a much pricier place. Pools: Swim-up bars are nice and long here, and my kids were treated with respect, and patience, even after ordering drink after drink. I know there's been a threat about kids at the swim-up bars, and whether it's appropriate for them to be there, but it was a highlight of their trip, to order a cool drink for themselves. I don't believe they were a nuisance to other guests. I personally like pools that meander around the resort, and these were a little too simple for my taste. My kids would say the pools at the Bahia Principe win hands down, but the swim-up bar is better at the Tequila. Excursions: We did the \"poor man's Xel-ha, which is Ya-Kul Lagoon. $30 cab ride each way, $9 adults, $6 kids. Snorkeling there is fine, and the water is nice and calm, and easy for beginners. Not an amazing number of fish, but enough that we were satisfied. Clarity varies.. most of it is pretty good near the rocks, where the fish are. We saved about $300 going there instead of Ya-Kul, cause we weren't interested in doing zip lines anyway.

We had high hopes given its status on Trip Advisor, however overall we were disappointed. Last year we stayed further south at the Gran Bahia Principe Coba (which after staying at the Tequila, I will now write glowing reviews of the Bahia). So this was our bar for comparison for the week. Throughout our week long stay I kept wondering how people have given this resort such high praise. I also have no idea how the Riu Yucatan is ranked so much lower than the Tequila. The food is exactly the same, but the pool is nicer and you have the beach right there. We also took a stroll through the neighboring Palace hotel. The pool was quite large and quite empty, and the grounds seemed much more well kept. Pros: The beach is nice. Plenty of chairs to be had each day. The number of chain smokers is quite astounding, and the fact that there are hundreds upon thousands of cigarettes mixed in with the white sand takes away from the natural beauty of the beach. The walk to the beach is also lovely, a covered path will get you there in about 5 minutes. We never took the cart and always walked. The service was also decent. We had a few plumbing issues that were fixed promptly. I know everyone at the resort works hard and that was mostly clear throughout our stay. Mimosas on Sunday were a nice touch, but you couldn't get champagne or mimosas any other day of the week. Finally, it's nice to be in a gated community. As 3 women, we felt safe traveling and strolling at night. We made it down to 5th ave a couple times, and the $7 cab fare got us out of the resort for some shopping and some decent food. Cons: Overall I would say the Riu Tequila was the con. We enjoyed the pool at the Yucatan much better. It seemed cleaner, larger, and somewhat less crowded. Although you have to get there early (before 7) to get a chair. (We were also there during school break, so I'm not sure if this is consistent.) It was nice to hop from the beach to the pool. Our room was small and musty. Everything felt damp, and my friend's pillow smelled like mold and sweat. We tried multiple times to get a new pillow, but it always ended up back on the bed. Our towels were always stained or fraying, which is pretty gross when you are using them to lay on or dry off on. I would say the resort itself is fairly clean. I thought the Tequila pool smelled like stale beer by mid-afternoon, and cups were left all around. Every morning the resort was clean, but it didn't last long. The food was eh. I know it's industrial food to serve many people at once, but there was nothing that wowed us. It was nice to have the opportunity to eat at the restaurants every night, but you have to make reservations between 7 & 9 each morning. The food at the restaurants was marginally better than the buffet, and we really didn't like the Mexican restaurant at all. Bottom line, we won't be going back.

The Playacar complex is made up of several hotels in a secured and safe environment. You may use the facilities of the Riu Yucatan and Riu Playacar. I believe that the the Riu Tequil, Although not on the beach was the best of the hotels. Our party was that of 2 adults 2 children(8 and 11 yrs) and 2 seniors. Cancun airport is a nightmare. We landed at 2 and were out by 4. Very smooth transfer. Greeted with a drink and shown to our rooms which were very accepatable. The Hotel is immensly clean and ther were no flies or wasps and no mosquitos. But then I did wear my special Avon spray!! The pools were gorgeous with a swim up bar and the entertainment team were fantastic for the kids. My daughter went in for the LittleMermaid show and it was great.Now unfortunately, there has been a down side. After about the 4th day we all had a touch of the dodgy bellies. The adults were affected and not the children thank goodness.. This affected most of the holiday for 2 of us and unfortunatley put my mother in law in hospital. Now she was diagnosed with gastroentroitus and dyhydration and the hospital care at the Playa Carmen(H10) Hospital was fantastic. They requested 4000 pesos for the ambulance and then everything was settled by insurance. The reception staff on return to the hotel gladly arranged her prescriptions without extra charge and the thomson staff were charming. No complaints there. So where did the upset tummies come from? I don't think it was the food as it was all so clean and they offererd on a weekly basis a tour of the kitchens. Another lady and another party were affected but I personally feel that a bug was brought in. It did spoil the holiday. The food- Now we all love our food and we feel that the food was a bit below par. This is the 4th AI that we have stayed in. There was no fresh fish and we thought being the caribbean that there would be lots of it. The fish was fried or cooked to death. My kids loved the food, but then that's what it was, glorified kids food. The fried eggs at breakfast were nice but the poached had a lemon taste, the beans were too sweet.Loads of choice for continental. We much preferred the food at the Iberostar at the Dom Rep. We went to the Steakhouse one night and this was excellant. However, we repeated the event the 2nd week and it wasn't quite so good. There arelittle Coatis roaming around which are dead sweet, They don't bother you at all unless you offer them food and then they will go mad!! The entertainment team put on excellant shows, We especially enjoyed Mama Mia and Grease. They provided a Mexican night and casino night which was fun. Playa del Carmen was fun but too much pressured selling. Batar by all means but they shut the door on you which was uncomfortable. During the day around the pool, the entertertainment team did a pool party with a paella which was delicious and there is a woman by the pool who does jewellery and giftswhich are better, in my o pinion of the others outside the hotel. When you have done other all inclusives, it does show you which is good and which is not. Please do not be put off by this review, we just love our food, but we love love fine food not junk. On conclusion, we had a very nice holiday, although spoit by illness, which I don't believe to be a fault of the hotel but an unfortunate virus. The suport we received was excellant. kids had the best holiday ever and met some good friends. If you are after good food, don't go here but for good fun do.

Some of the chefs were more helpful in this respect, when asked to cater for him. The queues for the buffet were very long at times, but overall the standard of food was superb and was worth waiting for. The steak restaurant was superb, but is very popular. We only managed to book it once, so go early to reserve this (reservations made outside the dining room at breakfast time). The standard family room was slightly small, and in particular the two beds (queen sized and not double) were a bit small for a family of four. The bathroom was open plan too. There was lots of local wildlife to see, including very tame anteater-like and guinea pig-like native mammals, who came up to our balcony for feeding (sorry, I forget their names). The contents of the minibar in each room is free. As with so many hotels, finding empty sunloungers in the morning was very difficult, although usually weren\u2019t all occupied until 9am. Towels in sunloungers would be removed by the hotel staff if it was very obvious no one was using them. The pool was very nice, including a popular swim-up bar. This got quite rowdy in the afternoon at times. The hotel is also quite popular with visitors from the US and Canada. The entertainment was of an extremely high standard. The animation staff were great fun and excellent shows were put on in the evening. This included productions such as Grease and Mama Mia. We felt quite safe venturing outside the hotel, although there was some pressure from shopkeepers in the main shopping area in Playa de Carmen to visit their stores.

The Room itself is big enough, very clean, has the all in mini bar, the TV, etc etc etc. But you haven't travelled all this way to sit in your room have you?? The Pool area with the bars and restaurant is the complex hub during the day, and is quite lively. The Riu animation team are very good, they make you feel involved with all the games, even if you aren't taking part. Lunch is taken at the Lupita restaurant by the pools, and the choice is varied with every taste catered for. Fast food or fine, the choice is yours. The bar staff by the pools work tirelessly for you, and even when busy you never are kept waiting too long. If you want, self service wine, beer, soft drinks and ice cream are all available. The Food in general was superb, the choice is massively varied. We have in our family four very fussy eaters, and not one of us ended any day hungry. It is a buffet style service with drinks being waitered to your table. Every night in the main restaurant there are fresh meats being cooked, pasta prepared to order, countless side dishes to choose from, almost too many as some nights you wished you could try everything! A massive salad selection, breads, and many desserts are available. The Ice Cream is a top choice. As I mentioned all of our family thought the food was great. I see some complaints and grumbles on here about the food, and really cannot see what they are on about, but some people can find fault in anything! There are A La Carte restaurants available, we tried the Steakhouse, but the kids were better fed with the greater choice from the main dining hall. Granted you do need to get up quick in the morning to book an early sitting, but we were happy with our 9pm slot. Breakfast is also in the main dining hall, again a huge choice is available. Wish I could have said no to more things on offer at breakfast time, definitely a good chance to over indulge!! The Tequila's location is not on the beach, but the walk is a pleasant one, taking only 5 mins, or you can wait for the shuttle , but you must go as it is so very well worth it. The beach is amazing. Our family as a rule are pool people, but in Mexico the beach rules. The sea is fabulous, with big crashing waves in the waist deep water, my kids both adored it. Watch out for the fish! Evening entertainment is top notch from the hard working Animation team, they really do know how to put on a fun show. They performed Grease, Mamma Mia and Moulin Rouge whilst we were there, and had other various themed nights. We took a taxi to Playa del Carmen and visited 5th avenue one evening, I would recommend going before dark if you have young children as it can get pretty busy and hectic. It was good and the hassle from local vendors wasn't to much to handle. We also hired a car for the day, \u00a360 fully insured. Visited Cancun and saw some sites. If you do hire a car, watch the roads carefully especially speed bumps and \"topes\". As a family we cannot praise the Riu Tequila highly enough, it was a top drawer holiday. I didn't mention things like the sports bar, the free wifi in the lobby, the shops down the street, the choice of cocktails, the monkeys. The staff are always helpful and cheerful, the only bad thing to say about the place is that some guests could take some advice on manners from these Riu employees. (Yes I mean you, arrogant Yank taking your food plates from the dining hall and abusing the staff on your way, its probably you who gives the resort a poor review!?!)

Brilliant hotel\u201d", "Author": "Birmingham73", "ReviewID": "UR104895754", "Content": "Just returned from a two week holiday and the Tequila hotel HAS to be summed up as FANTASTIC value for your money. We endorse ALL of the positive comments made about this hotel and can only laugh at the moans and groans made by others. The food was plentiful in both volumes and choice. Not cordon-bleu but certainly to a good standard. Only one type of beer included (2XX brand). Almost every cocktail could be made for you on the spot. Only downside is if you like champagne/cava based cocktail then you have to pay for it. However, on a few mornings, there were free bucks-fizz/mamosas poured out as you went for breakfast ! Rooms quite large with a bathroom/seperate toilet/wash-basin/wardrobes/fridge(full of beer, water, pop, tonics,7UP etc/safe/4 spirit optics all contained in another area curtained off from the bedroom area. 'Differant' is what we summed it up as. On a practical front :- We took a small travel kettle (remembered to switch it to 110 volts) as there's no facilities in your room to make tea/coffee (shame). BTW, every one of our 220 V electrical chargers/transformers/adaptors worked fine on 110v as we bought two GB-USA plug convertors (\u00a3stretcher shop, \u00a31 for 2).Took a few Josh-sticks to help disquise the slight musty 'aroma' in the room (which you tend to find in most rooms within tropical areas due to air conditioning and humidity etc). Took two 500ml Thermos cups which are great to keep your drinks cool for that little bit longer (and for the greedier types, saves you having to go to the bar(s) less often as the drinks served in hotel plastic beakers are about 1/4 pint ! Saw a few people with 'Mozzie' bites but we were lucky. Fortunately, an 'old soldier' told us a few years ago about taking Vitamin B, garlic capsules (odourless) and an anti-histamin tablet every day whilst away. (Start the Vitamins and garlic about a week before you go away if possible). Works for us every time even when it's the proper 'Mozzie' season. Another tip, take a small role of RED electricl insulation tape or a small role of sticking plaster because the hotel wrist band they give you has a fairly large 'use once' security press-stud that doesn't half catch on everything, including your sunburnt bits ! Wrap some tape carefully around the stud to 'smooth' or 'round' it off a little. Beach is fantastic and also worth wandering into the RIU hotels named Yucatan and Playacar (which you can use and you're identified by the red wrist band). Yucatan OK as a drinks stop as it is nearest hotel to where you'd probably settle for the day.Bar pool at Yucatan looked suspiciously yellowish in colour ! Worth the 5 minute walk along ther beach into the RIU Playacar for lunch (Far, far better than the Yucatan) trust us. So, the Tequila is NOT a 5* hotel (by worldwide comparisons) but if you want tried and tested 5* plus, you're going to have to pay more than double the Tequila's rates to get something which is not going to be TWICE as good ! Unless you are a princess who would REALLY know there is a pea under your matress, you are going to have to go out of your way to find any MAJOR fault with this place. Enjoy.

As value for money goes I think it would be hard to beat, we went in a party of 10 to celebrate a special anniversary so all inclusive was perfect for us. Just think of the difficulties of getting a table to eat at night together with the cost of the meals and endless amounts of drinks and you realise what good value it is. All the staff are very friendly, the rooms are all fairly basic but roomy and spotlessly clean. The food is very good, they have 4 restaurants 3 need bookings, and the food is varied and good in them all. The bar service is incredible. you can try every cocktail under the sun at the pool bar or you can enjoy your Whisky or Brandy to your hearts content with or after your meal. The standard of entertainment was very good although a little repetitive, mostly musicals, having said that the children in our group thought it was great, and they all fell in love with \u2018CRAZY JAMES\u2019, but all the cast were so enthusiastic and were very friendly and professional . We travelled on a Thomson package and took advantage of their Premier Seating, which although not first class standard is nevertheless good value with preference check in, and inclusive meals and drinks, TV & Video and better legroom. We took advantage of some of the Tour options that were on offer (swim with the Dolphins and the F1 Explorer boat trip), and by the way Thomson were considerably cheaper than the kiosk in the Hotel grounds. The boat trip was excellent but the swim with the Dolphins was disappointing very little time in the water with the Dolphins and exorbitant prices for photographs think of \u00a325 for one digital photo on a disc which you have to print off yourself when you get home. We did the Chichen Itza last time which was very good. Don\u2019t get to excited about the prospect of shopping it\u2019s typical tourist facilities, they do have individual stalls that come into the hotel on their theme nights which are as good as you will get in Playa Del Carman\u2019s 5th Avenue.

The staff,service,food,grounds,entertainment all top notch! While the rooms are not fancy,they are very comfortable and cleaned extremely well by the maids. Also loved all the wildlife on the resort grounds, the Mexican \"Racoons\" and others made it extra special. The pools are great and the beach although a short walk away, is just amazing. It is actually really nice to do some walking and enjoy the scenery. The pottery shop by the Lupita restaurant is wonderful, we were able to create beautiful memories by painting our own souveniers to take home. Front desk staff is wonderful and multilingual. A special thank you goes to Pablo at front desk for his willingness to help and going the extra mile when a problem arose (not related to the resort). Never Ever book anything with the tour companies on 5th avenue/Playa del Carmen, only book your yours at the resort lobby with the professional tour companies. We made a mistake of booking an Xcaret Plus/Dolphin Swim with a company called Mayan Trail and were promised a nice discount. We paid a 20$ deposit and were told that the rest can be paid when we are picked up from our resort...the catch was to be willing to go with DIEGO, the sales person from this SCAM tour company, to Allegro Playacar for a timeshare spiel which was to take 90 minutes..we knew we would not purchase anything but went anyway thinking we got a discount on Xcaret tickets and ended up spending all day with these people. At Allegro, a guy names CHRIS, another crook, took us to the Occidental Grand Xcaret for a tour and breakfast and showed us the Royal Club suites which they are trying to sell. Occidental/Allegro hotel chain is behind this timeshare scam and they work in the co-operation with these so called tour companies to suck people in for their presentations. Then we were taken back to the Allegro and had to endure a peer pressure presentation of this timeshare scam and when we did not wish to buy into it, Chris' demeanor sure changed, his was pissed off and vanished without saying a word..typical crook, commission hungry rip-off artist, just like this Diego character representing Mayan Trail Tours. A lady there gave us some reservation ticket for the Dolphins at Xcaret park and $55 USD cash claiming that they made a reservation but could not pay for it...blaaah blaah. The next day we were to be picked up from the RIU Tequila at 8:30 but the phone rang in our room at 7am to inform us that there had been an accident and if we could go another day..advised it was not possible and us and our two little children were ready and excited to go. We were told that they would call us back in 5 minutes but they never did. Went to the front desk and they had never heard of this tour company and called the number on the \"receipt\" and phone was hung up in our ear. Called again and we were told that we will be picked up at 10:25am.....well they never showed. We ended up taking a taxi 15USD x 2 for roundtrip and paying for the Xcaret Plus + Dolphin Swim at the gate in full...less the $55 USD that was given to us...so in the end we were on the plus side by 5$ with this scam after taxi rides ($30)and lost $20 deposit. The Xcaret Park was beautiful and the Dolphinus Park staff was amazing, our little daughter was made to feel soooo special, it was amazing! Returning back to the Riu Tequila after all this, felt like coming home, it felt so safe and comfortable. We have stayed at Occidental hotels before but never again. We will stick to the RIU,Bahia Principe and alike from now on..as they a truly fantastic! It angers us that the Occidental chain has stooped so low as to orchestrate such a scam and to screw families with little children, how dare they!!! Oh, by the way. We were told by Diedo not to tell the Allegro presentation staff that I work in travel industry...as he would not get his commission..as we most likely would not qualify as people being screwed over..too much inside knowledge. It was appalling to see a rep for Occidental Grand whom I have met in Edmonton at a trade show, sitting there at Occidental Grand breakfast table trying to suck them into this timeshare scam. I know I will not recommend any Occidental chain hotels and will try and sway people from booking them even if I lost my job over it. I know this has happened to many people out there and though I knew better...but :( Live and learn!!

ROOMS Clean, not exactly modern, but just what you would expect in Mexico - plenty of room - seperate dressing and washing area in the room. Cleaners are fantastic - rooms made up - things tidied away for you everday. Minibar/ optics refreshed on demand - plenty of bottled water. POOL - You get pool towels so dont need to take your own. 3 pools - 1 small kids pool - and play area great for the little ones. 2 other big pools - 1st with swim up bar and jacuzzi, 2nd with submerged sunbeds, pool games etc. ENTERTAINMENT - I have never had such good entertainment on a holiday - the entertainment team are soooo funny, friendly etc, even if at home you dont like taking part in activities you really will want to on this holiday. The shows on a nightime are excellent - everything from Grease to Mama Mia, Las Vegas to Ideal Couple - even themed things in the lobby like casino night, singers etc. 5* DEFINATELY! FOOD - Dont go if your on a diet cause you could eat forever so much choice!!! Breakfast - Plenty of choice - even for fussy eaters. Lunch- in the pool restaurant - again absolutley fine, fresh fruit, salad, chips, pizza, pasta etc. - also they do the odd day were they do a BBQ outside with freshly cooked burgers etc. Dinner- Loads to choose from served 6.30-10.30pm - themed nights. You can alos use the facilities of the neighbouring hotels of the RIU PLAYACAR, RIU YUCATAN etc. REALLY GOOD HOLIDAY IF YOU LIKE TO RELAX, BUT WITH THE OPTION TO DO ACTIVITIES GO OUT ETC.

Did not want to leave. Have never been to a hotel where the staff are so friendly without seemingly waiting for tips all the time. The entertainment staff work really hard day and night to provide something for everyone if they want it but they don't constantly pester you if you don't. Crazy James is as the name suggests!!!! It didn't matter that this hotel didn't have a beachfront. This is easy to get to either by walking 5 minutes (a very pleasant shady walk) or taking the hotel shuttle service which runs all the time. There is a massive beach with plenty of sunbeds and shade if you want it. The beauty of it is is that you can use the Riu Yacatan's facilities so, if you fancy a dip in the pool rather than the sea, you can go straight off your sunbed into their pool. You also get to eat there and drink there (still all inclusive). I would rather stay in the Tequila rather than the Yucatan as the Yucatan appeared to be a bit noisier. If you want or need anything you only have to ask and the staff will try their best to accommodate your request. People do seem to think that the staff are mind-readers. The only two small problems with the hotel are it is very difficult to get a 7pm sitting in any of the three places to eat. You have to go to the main reception in person between 7am and 10am to get either a 7pm or 9pm sitting. However, leave it until 7.30am and there are not normally any 7pm sittings to be had. Who wants to get up at that time just to book a table to eat? They need to think of a new system. The other slight issue is that the rooms smell a little damp and musty as do the drawers where you store your clothes. Oh, and by the way, some people are extremely sad and get up at the crack of dawn to reserve sunbeds (even though you are told not to and there are signs up telling you not to).

At breakfast we tended to get our own tea because it was normally cold and they seem to want to give us hot milk!! The dining room lacked personal attention, certainly at dinner time, whether this was lack of staff I am not sure, but they were very friendly and helpful when we got their attention. This is not a 5 star hotel as stated in the brochure, if you expect to see people in t-shirts, shorts and flip flops for dinner. In fact most of the rules that were displayed were not enforced by staff, i.e. no inflatables or balls in the main pool; men suppose to wear long sleeves. Cannot fault our room service at all. Dealt with any issues we had within 5 mins. Our bedding and towels were changed every day. For the number of rooms would have thought there would have been more swimming pools or more space in the sun round the pools. We have just had a lovely hot dinner at home and a decent glass of red wine. We will not be going back to the Tequilla, we were disappointed in this Riu hotel and had hoped it was on a par with the Riu we stayed in in Dominican Republic.", "Date": "April 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Montreal, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGood vacations with baby....but parents are sick...\u201d", "Author": "isaolivia", "ReviewID": "UR102483107", "Content": "We were in Riu Tequila from March 22th to March 29th, with our 22 month's daughter. We enjoyed the resort, the rooms were really clean and luxuous. We had two queen beds, so baby had her own bed. The pools are great, there is a playground for childs. You have access to others Riu Yucatan near the beach, so you can lunch there. The only things, is that you cannot change your towel near to beach. So you keep your towel all day long even if it's wet, or you have to come back to Tequila to change it. The beach is a little walk or you can take the shuttle. But the shuttle was not in function every day. However, it was not a problem even with a stroller. But if you expect to be close of the beach, if you are physical limited you may be not appreciate that. You can go to Playa Del Carmen by walk, it's around 40 minutes by walk. The staff from the hotel were exceptional, very kind. We went to Barcelo Maya Beach two years before, and the quality of foof was better at Barcelo. The food and buffet are good, but it's not a new theme every night, and the quality didn't impress us. Also, the travel guide told us we can drink water at the restaurants, and that the water is purified on the site. So, we drank water served at restaurants... I got so so so sick... vomit 15 times, diarhea...and it's not because of alcohol. We almost call the doctor (it cost 100$US if you need him to come at the resort). My husband who never get sick usually, also got sick as we are back home. Baby is not sick yet.. It's not sure it's because of the resort, but you should pay attention at water... Also, there is a ''stupid'' cat on the resort...Cute, but stupid. He decided to pee(?) (uriner) on the stroller and on my purse as we were eating on the terrace.... Except for that, we would recommend this resort to friends. There are also monkeys on the way to RIU Yucatan, it's impressing ! If you have a stroller, don't forget to ask for a room to the first floor...because there is no elevator.. Very easy with a baby in buffet and restaurants.

He was not about to allow me to use the hotel's phone since it would be \"expensive\" to phone the USA. I made it clear that his refusal was unacceptable. After checking with his \"manager\" he allowed my use of the front desk phone. The cab came and we were transported to the Riu Playacar in a 1 1/2 minute journey. It was a very dissappointing beginning to our week. While at the Playacar we met a family of five, also from the USA, who were given the same basic run around at the Tequila.

Positives: - great staff! They responded to any issues we had promptly and were a pleasure to deal with. We also went to the Riu Playa Car and Yucatan and agreed that we had the nicest hotel, lobby and best staff. - beautiful beach! The five-minute walk was refreshing, the sand was gorgeous and the drinks at the bar were yummy. - the buffet. I was very impressed with the selection and quality of the food. There really was something for everyone. Negatives: - signing up for the a la carte restaurants. This was by far my biggest complaint. I am on vacation - I really don't want to wake up at 6:30am to go stand in a long line so I can get a reservation for a restaurant. And trust me, you need to wake up that early. We were down there by 7am two days and the early reservations for the Japanese and steak restaurants were already full. I wish the Riu would remedy this situation as it's exactly the opposite of what a relaxing vacation is supposed to feel like. - the beds. The \"king\" is two beds pushed together AND made up separately. I knew it was two beds going into the trip but I didn't realize that if you tried to sleep close to your partner you'd have to rip off the sheets and then if you ended up in the middle the beds would slowly slide apart! They really should replace the beds with true kings. Also our sheets were never changed in the week we were there. I'm not a clean freak by any means but I think when you're paying that much, new linens at least one time in seven days is not too much to ask for. One day I took all the bedding of the bed and put it on the floor and they just put it right back on the bed!!!

The hotel clearly states it isn't on the beach so make sure you know this before going and get disappointed. This is really not an issue though, it literally a 5 min walk or 2 mins on the golf buggy (although this only seats 7 so we rarely got it) The walk is actually really pleasant under a canopy walkway with benches all the way and boards with all the Riu hotels around the world which is nice to look at as you walk. We were here during USA/Canadian Spring break which we didn't know before booking, so the hotel was full capacity most of the time, so some things seemed busy, but by no means crowded or annoying, just busy, i wouldn't have guessed it was full. There was just one day when we got up very late and all the beds on the beach were taken, every last one. However there is always beds by the pool, granted not in the sun, but there's about 50 extra (green beach style ones, not the blue pool ones) kept under the trees behind the sports area (ping pong and basketball area) Granted there is an issue of staying in the sun by the pool, a few less trees would solve this, but then again its a very green natural looking hotel. There are some spots on the back row (not right by pool) that people avoid thinking you'd get less sun, but actually there's more room to maneuver and you can stay in the sun from 9-5 and we pretty much were able to get one of these beds arriving after breakfast at 9/9.30 ish when lots of beds had been reserved for hours already by then lol. It is good when the staff remove towels and leave a note asking not to reserve beds, although this only happened the once while we were there. The sand on the beach is amazingly cool to walk on, and it is quite windy so feels cool. The bars are very good, the staff so friendly and they work so hard and as fast as they can. There is a drinks menu on all the bars, which I love, I often want a bit of inspiration when on holiday and not wanting to just drink my usual, and not many all inclusives i've been to have had a menu, it had most of the spririts listed, plus lots of cocktails. There's plenty of international options, Baileys, bacardi, jim bean, smirnoff, martini and lots more. There's also serve yourself wine, beer, soft drinks/fruit juices and tea coffee making facilites and a box of ice to help yourself which i like so you don't always have to bother the barstaff. The buffet restaurants are brilliant, no complaints from us, I was immensly impressed with the salad bars, I'm normally craving salad after all inclusives, but there was lots of choice and always fresh looking. The evening buffet has themes which change daily, international, mexican, asian, gala etc. The steak house restaurant was very nice, gorgeous soup! the bambu restaurant wasn't brilliant in my view, just because the buffet often served really nice asian food and the bambu is buffet style aswel, so i dont really get the point, apparently its the same with the mexican which we didn't try for this reason. It would be nice to have these 2 restaurants being a la carte and have proper table service, thats the point of having extra options apart from the buffet i think, to make the meal a more special event and last longer. You did have to book before 8.30 for an early sitting but there was always the late sittings available. The rooms were just fine, there is only a curtain into the bathroom type area but its quite nice, and the shower is so powerful I never had it on full. Always warm aswel. Rooms cleaned everyday. The optics were Jose cuervo tequila, then local brands of vodka rum and borbon i think. Always had plenty of water and soft drinks, i asked for diet pepsi and whenever it was filled up we got pepsi and diet pepsi as requested. I think i've rambled on enough about the hotel, it exceeded my expectations even though I specifically chose it due to the amazing reviews. Everyone from the other hotels comes to the tequila in the day and for the evening shows, even from the Palace which is 5*. If you are considering the tequila or palace, we actually had one night in the Palace due to delay, so the comparisons:- the rooms are bigger with a sofa in the tv area. the tv is also flat screen sony. the optics are all international brand, smirnoff, bacardi. There is a bath with shower over, Coffee machine in room also. the buffet has a few more choices, but mainly the same. It is however set out a bit better so you are less likely to end up with a plate full of randomness. there is a chocolate fountain aswel lol. the lobby bar however wasn't able to make us a hot chocolate (which we got everyday at the pool bar in Tequila, served with kahlua yummy) On our departure very early, the lobby bar only thing open for drinks, however the coffee was served just luke warm?? the staff not a patch on the tequila staff, Go to the tequila, you wont regret it.", "Date": "March 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "newcastle", "Title": "\u201ctop hotel just a little busy\u201d", "Author": "NewcastleStu", "ReviewID": "UR102033340", "Content": "just back from two great weeks in Mexico, having arrived at the airport it seemed a little busy( spring break in Canada/USA) after the passport stamped and visa taken, collect bags to find a customs system red or green light to see if your bag will be searched, me green wife red Bag empited all over the place. avoid bag handlers when leaving the airport as they will expect money for nothing for doing very litte as your coach will be around the corner, transfer time was a hour with a very happy chap selling beer and water for the trip (no change given),as in other review once you arrive at the hotel the check in very first class envelope,room key and wrist band ( bags left ) and off to the room. we were in room 1805 ground floor with terrace no sun at all, close to the quiet pool and steak house. two big beds TV (fox sports for english football) fridge with pop and beer, four spirits above to try. good shower with toilet at the side large wardrobe with free safe in the bottom. room cleared all the time and spotless( never seen a hotel cleaned so much) mess made by others under the effects of drink. the first week the hotel was very busy a little of kids and old colledge types 18/21, this was reflected in the problems within the dinner hall on a evening a lot of ques for food, the place just could not handle the numbers of people who all wanted to eat at the same time. again for steak house and bambo pre book at 7am most times full for first sitting, we did try both and both very good Bambo seemed to change its Menu but both times very good. food was of a good standard and good selection, yes their was faults at times it was just too busy.pool areas again were very busy towels were removed from unused beds that had been left or reserved, certain people had beds in the sun and shade for which took great pleasure in taking. the bars again very busy buts lots of good staff on hand, who seemed to be abused the young kids of the usa five slammers etc brigade (show some respect instead of throwin them a dollar to be served and noticed). meet some great people from windsor in Canada and some lovely folk from england that made the holiday thank you all (ron and family). the beach was a walk along between two hotels or a ride on the golf buggy (need to get your towels at the pool) only shades at the beach are the trees the sea was a little rough all windy so watch you do not burn.

This resort was exactly what we were looking for. We enjoyed the laid back atmosphere, great beaches and good food. Room: The rooms were large enough, we found them quite, and had everything you needed. They don't have bathtubs which was fine for us. There were 2 double beds in every room, and you couldn't get a king, but that was fine. I found the room to be clean, comfortable and exactly what I was expecting. Pool: The pool at this resort was large and beautiful. There were two sides, one side that they played games in and the other with the pool bar. There were loungers in the pool. We enjoyed this area. It was pretty quite most of the time. We found the pool of the Riu Yucatan a bit more active. It was nice to have the option to use each resort. Food: We found the food was really good. The buffet was large with lots of options. We found both Breakfast and dinner really good. We didn't have too many problems getting reservations at the A la Cartes, other then the Steakhouse, which we were able to get into 2 times but only for 9pm which is late. The food was great there though. We ate at the Asian, which I didn't enjoy very much, but we all enjoyed the Mexican. Dinner at the buffet had lots of options and they had theme nights to make it all a bit different. My only small complaint was lunch. The lunch menu was very limited, and while you could eat at the other resorts, it was the same menu. What they had was good, but not much choice. I was surprised that the main buffet wasn't open at lunch. The 24 hour sports bar, had snacks but they weren't very good other then the fruit. Entertainment: We didn't do any of the day time activities but they were well posted if you wanted to take part. The night time entertainment was a bit hit and miss. Some shows were really good, some weren't. Very similar to other resorts I have been to in that reguard. I have always found, if you want high quality nightly entertainment, go on a cruise. Service/Lobby: I really liked the large comfy lobby with WIFI included. We did spend a bit of time here. The Service from the staff was excellent. Beach: A very short walk to the beach, or a shuttle was available. We mostly walked as it was nice to be able to walk outdoors in March, unlike at home in Atlantic Canada!

The guys in front had been allowed to book for multiple rooms guests and I was told that the 50/60 seats had all been taken! I complained to the manager and eventually got the sitting we wanted. Many others complained including a dozen Canadians who had the same problem the night before. It's a shame that the management at the hotel seem unreceptive to the complaints they've recieved about this when the introduction of some sensible controls would address this problem e.g. one booking per room (in person), limit the visits per week to avoid \"hogging\" of the specialist restaurants by holiday insomniacs!

We booked this hotel through Tomson on a recommendation from a friend and we didn't regret it. Upon getting off the plane in Cancun, it took a while to get our bags and get through passport control etc but once we were out the airport the holiday really started! It was a short walk to the coach which awaited to take us to the Riu Tequila. We were checked off a list and took our seats on the air conditioned coach. The journey from Cancun To Playa del Carmen took just over an hour but it seemed to fly by with all the sights to take in as we went. There was a local rep who spoke on the microphone for ten minutes or so to let us know about the area and a few places not to miss. This was very useful and worth listening to. On arrival at the hotel we were greeted with an ice cold fruit drink which was very welcome in the heat! Tomson have a good set up at the hotel to speed up check in. You simply get given an envelope which has your room key, map of the resort, towel cards and stickers for your cases. Put the stickers on your cases and the porters know where to take them. Wrist bands are put on you by staff of the hotel and your ready to rock. We were pointed in the direction of our room and off we went. The resort has a lovely array of plants which really gives it a feel like you're in the forest. Once we got to the room, I cracked open a bottle of 'XX' beer from the fridge and relaxed. The fridge is topped up every other day and you usually get 4 x beers, 2 x pepsi, 2 x fanta and bottles of water. Soon after we arrived, the porters brought our cases but hung around the doorway asking questions about where we were from. They basically wanted a tip so I gave them 40 pesos each and off they went. Our first morning we went to breakfast at the buffet restaurant and there's plenty of choice. There's freshly cut fruit, flavoured yogs, cereals, toast and of course the cooked breakfast. The omellettes were a particular favourite of mine, very tasty! For the Americans, there was burgers, pancakes and doughnuts available. Amazing how many kids were eating theses fatty, sugary delights for breakfast. Each to their own I suppose. Lunch can be eaten at the steak house by the pool or at the Mexican restaurant by the beach. You also have use of the restaurant next to the Mexican which I thought was a bit better. The food for lunch is much the same with burgers, hot dogs, pizza, chips and other hot choices but there is a really good salad bar so not all the food is bad for you! : ) If you fancy it there's an ice cream machine to finish off lunch. Dinner can be eaten at the buffet restaurant, main doors off the foyer or at any of the three restaurants belonging to the hotel. There's a steak house, Mexican and Asian. We tried them all and enjoyed them all to be honest. The steak is a little different to what we get in England but still was tender. I prefered the chicken. The Asian was nice with a good choice from the hot and cold buffet. The deep fried ice cream is amazing! The Mexican offered a small salad choice but you get plenty of hot choices through the courses. I had the mixed fajitas which were very tasty. You must book to eat at any of these three restaurants which you do when you go for breakfast. Be warned though, if you dont get to breakfast when it opens (0700) then you may end up eating as late as 2100 or even find the restaurants fully booked. I had to get in the que at 0630 (30 mins before opening) to get a reasonable time slot. This isn't the hotels fault though just us bloody tourists! On to the pool... There is two pools which are divided by the steak restaurant. One side of the pool is for games such as water polo and the other side is where the swim up bar is. I had many a drink at this bar. The staff were very friendly and liked to have a laugh. No need to tip here unless you want to. The beach...The beach is spot on. A 5 minute walk up a covered walk way or take the golf buggy that leaves regularly. Lovely white sand that doesn't get hot in the sun and lovely blue water. The sea wasn't warm but you get used to it almost straight away and it's lovely. There's use of another hotels bar if you want to get drinks and take them down to the beach. There's plenty of sun beds but sometimes they can all be in use but we never really struggled to get one. There's a couple of locals who walk around showing you what water sports are available. These guys are legitamate and by all means sign yourself up. Room service...The cleaners are very good. Clean rooms every day and the bed was always made. They make animal characters out of towels which is a nice touch. No complaints at all! Towel rental...Take your towel cards to the towel shack by the steak restaurant and exchange for towels. When you bring them back you get the cards back ready for the next day. Trips...We booked two trips through Tomson. One was a trip to Chichen Itza which took 2 1/2 hours each way. The pyramid is worth seeing as are the other ruins around the site. Lots of interesting things to see if your into that sort of thing. On the way back to the hotel we stopped at a cenote (fresh water cave) which was amazing. Fresh water, 50m deep with greenery and vines all around. Check it out on the internet. Also stopped off at a buffet restaurant which was nice but the staff were constantly showing us where to leave tips even though you get your own food. All they did was bring drinks. Tip as much as you want. The other trip was snorkelling with turtles. This is worth doing. We were lucky enough to see two turtles feeding on the sea bed (only 3-4m deep) which is rare and only a few places to see them in the wild around the world. This is a half day trip and recommended. Overall, this 10 day holiday was amazing and would deffinately go back. I dont want to write loads and loads as people get bored reading after a while.

We travelled with Sunquest and many realities were 'left out' upon booking this trip. First thing is that there is NO CONCEIRGE at this hotel. While normally this wouldn't be a huge problem on any trip I've been on, in this case it meant huge inconveniences! The RIU gives you access to 3 restuarants outside their normal 'cafeteria style' restaurants in the hotel. To book a dinner reservation at these other restaurants you have to line-up in the morning (we were told the line starts at 6:30 am!) Are you kidding?? I came on vacation to avoid getting up extra early in the morning! The real kicker is that you have do this for THREE mornings if you want to to get into each of the three restaurants for dinner. I understand that all-inclusive means that there is a 'herd mentality' at these resorts, but I would have been happy to pay more to avoid these huge inconveniences. It is such a relief that Sunquest offers a in-hotel representative to address all your concerns. The only problem is that Hector, our represenative, did absolutely nothing! He said he would 'look into' everything, but it was obvious that once Sunquest gets your money they put a person like Hector in the hotel to give a false impression they are taking care of you. On a positive note, the weather, beaches and hotel staff were good. My recommendation is to put your money elsewhere in future trips and don't go through the hassle that Sunquest and the RIU hotel puts you through. Unless you would like to wake up early to enjoy their 'fine' restaurants, this hotel will definitely disappoint. Bon Voyage!

Thankfully we didn\u2019t rush into booking a hotel as we were spoilt for choice so when we found out about the Tequila we compared it to the other hotels we were considering and for the price and trip advisor comments it definitely came out on top! The Riu Tequila lived up to what we thought. We had such a great holiday, probably our best one yet! As always there were good things as well as a couple of not so good things. Unless you have an endless budget I think this has to be expected in any holiday choice you make. The biggest piece of advice is to figure out what type of holiday you want before choosing a hotel. We knew we wanted a nice pool, close to beach, low rise accommodation , activities and a decent all inclusive package. The Tequila ticked every box. The hotel grounds were very well maintained with lots of tropical trees and shrubs. The pool was surrounded by plenty of trees so you got shade if you wanted it. The pool although a little crowded was lovely with a swim up bar one side and regular water activities happening on the other. The main lunch buffet area was in the middle so you could literally roll off your sun lounger and be there! The beach was a comfortable walk away with plenty of choice of sunloungers. The entertainment staff was fantastic in every way! They were friendly, happy and had a good balance of inviting you to take part in activities and knowing when you wanted to be left alone. They also did evening shows which were of a good standard. My only negative comment of the Tequila would be 2 out of the 3 speciality restaurants were poor! The Asian and Mexican were disappointing in quality of food and service. The steak house was good although the menu was very limited and the only choice you could make was for main meal. My expectation of a restaurant is to be able to choose from a menu! This didn\u2019t spoil the holiday in any way as there was plenty on offer at the main buffet. Playa Car is a well secured resort so it felt very safe to walk around out of the hotel in the day or evening.

The walk from the resort to the beach was not bad at all. Don't waste your time with dining at the Mexican a la carte restaurant on the beach\u2014the food's horrible! Asian restaurant was good; had sashimi, sushi, and FRIED ICE CREAM. But it was a buffet so don't expect a sit down menu. Didn't get a chance to try the steak house (wasn't ever early enough to make reservations). You're much better of getting exactly what you want at the buffet. Breakfast buffet was the BEST! POACHED EGGS\u2014actually, eggs ANY WAY YOU WANT THEM (hard boiled, soft boiled, over easy, over medium, scrambled, omelets, you get the drift). Because the resort is so BIG, they've got the buffet service down to a science. Lots of variety, you can get whatever you want. When the dining halls are CLOSED, however, you're stuck with leftover burgers/pizza/hotdogs in the sports bar. At 4am though, it does the trick. ALCOHOL: NOOOOOOOO. I thought this was going to be a long boozefest but it's pretty much impossible to get a good buzz going with their watered down liquor. You have to drink twice as many drinks\u2014better off buying a fifth in town. The wine is gross. If I had known better, I would've brought 5-6 bottles of champagne because you have to pay extra if you want bubbly from the resort. DON'T PAY THE \"NEW\" RATE OF $10 to get into town! It should be $6-7. The pool at Riu Yucatan is MUCH MORE LIVELY. Easier to find a spot at Tequila's pool, but it's super quiet and there's not much going on. Best spot is on the beach. Yes, many people reserve chairs but if you walk around and search, you can scrounge up chairs for your group (we had 4). Oh, and lots of topless older women. Just a warning. Overall, I really enjoyed the quality of service (you do NOT have to tip\u2014stayed at \"nicer\" resort and almost everyone tipped there. Not so much at this one), the quality of buffet food, and beautiful beach.

It was beautiful, exciting, wonderful, and oh so hot. Leaving the snow of Canada behind, we had a great week of sun, lots of drinks, great service and met some wonderful people who work there for a living. We went from march 6-13. food and drinks: -the breakfast buffet was amazing, so many selections and very delicious. Lots of carbs, chocolate muffins are to die for (we brought some home). -Lunch buffet near the pool was smaller, but still very good. There were very pretty watermelon sculptures. The wine smelled gross and warm.The entertainment team would join tables with extra seats. - The supper buffet was crazy!! so delicious, they opened the doors at 6:30pm and the waitors would personally bring you to your table. (Fidel was our favourite waitor). Every night they would have different themes. After supper we were so full we couldn't finish a plate of desert on our own, so we would get one plate for all of us (4 of us) of evey desert and share it. -Try the Banana Mama and the Miami Vice. WITH LIQUOR! (dont forget to drink alot of water because you will get dehydrated and you might be sick.) Beach: WOW! the waves were so much fun! They were very stong and would knock you down even if the water was just knee high. Not as much entertainment at the beach (no music). in 1 week we saw 2 couples get married. congrats! For the people with small kids, this is a tops optional beach, therefor there are some women without tops, but not many. Pool: the entertainment at the pool was amazing, they had volley ball, soccer, ping pong, and a basket ball court. and activities included aqua aerobics, darts, rifle shooting, water polo and much more. the music they play at the pool is pop. So if you dont like pop, bring your ipod. Other: -when leaving the resort on your left, there is a small version of 5th avenue. It takes about 3 minutes to walk there. we went after supper because it would cool down. It was very hot during the day. -The gym is in the Riu Yucatan, (right of the resort) -Go check out the Riu Palace (across the street) you can only go between 9am to 5pm and you need a pass you can get at the front desk. -The rooms have a curtain to separate the bathroom and the room, although you do have a door for the toilet. -The airconditioners only work when the patio door is closed. - It's 30 pesos for a game of pool -The entertainment team went to Coco Bongo some nights. for 50$ you had a ride to the Coco Bongo, have V.I.P tickets and open bar. you only needed 7$ extra for a taxi ride back to Riu Tequila -5th avenue is amazing. there are small alleys bewteen some shops, check those out. - 2 nights a week the resort has a small market so you can buy little things like jewelry, shirts, blankets, and masks. You can't baragin as much with them than at 5th ave because they have to pay the hotel. -the beds were a bit hard, but after a long day of doing nothing, you were tired. - the trolly from the beach to the resort did not run between 1pm and 3pm. - thursdays at 5pm, in the lobby, they had blackjack tables and a roulette table In conclusion, it was a great week and i want to thank joshua for taking off his shirt at volley ball. oh and mom and dad too.", "Date": "March 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cAMAAAAAZZZZING!!!\u201d", "Author": "JackieC1985", "ReviewID": "UR100169522", "Content": "Im constantly on this website reading ppl's comments before I decide where I want to go, and never have I ever felt the need to express myself until now.

The activity crew (Elias, Ivan, Joshua, Carla, Crazy James, Daniel..sorry if I missed any) were AMAAAAAAAZZZZZING such hard workers and def made our trip!! They were constantly on the go with games and activities, were GREAT with the kids and keeping them entertained and always full of high energy! Especially knowing that they work 11+hrs a day for 6 days straight with only one day off! I cannot express enough thanks to them for making this girls trip a memorable one! I'm very outgoing and not shy to talk to ppl I don't know, and came across a lot of other ppl by the pool that were from the other Riu's in the area, they told me that they preferred to come to our pool because of the Activity crew, they honestly were that amazing!

One of my friends is a huge germ-a-phobe and she had no complaints at all (which is a big thing)! The pool and grounds were very well kept, no garbage lying around, you would always see someone walking around picking up the empty cups etc!

We booked the Tequila from Feb-25 to Mar-6/11. Our children are 10 and 12 years old. This was our 4th visit to this resort because we have enjoyed staying there in the past. This was the first time we booked 10 days (the kids would have more time to get into all the activities that are offered at this resort).We we're so excited when we were dropped off at the front. We went to the front desk only to be informed that they didn't have a room for us and we were being \"upgraded to the Riu Playacar\".( I had confirmed our reservations the week before) Being our fourth stay we were quite familiar with their other Riu resorts. (You can use the Riu Playacar and the Riu Yucatan. You can't use their Palace Hotels).Yes the Playacar is closer to the beach but believe me it's not an upgrade it's a downgrade from the Tequila. If you've never been there before you should know that the properties are 2 or 3 stories high and they are very deep. So you will not have an \"ocean view\" and depending where your room is located you're walk to the beach could be as far as it is from the Tequila. When we were told they didn't have a room for us we asked for an explanation. the worst part was that as we stood there shocked, confused and upset, others were checking in no problem and they had rooms for everyone but us. We booked our rooms seperate from our filghts/ not a package, so we don't know if that was a reason....if they bumped us they wouldn't have to deal with a Tour Rep. The \"manager\" told us \"sales\" makes the decision. I called \"sales\" from the front desk and they tell me they didn't make that decision. The \"sales\" office I spoke to is located in Cancun. They were absolulety no help. Even after we explained to them that this was our 4th time using the Riu they just didn't care/customer service? there wasn't any. Rewards for loyalty? doesn't exist. The \"manager\" just stood there with an \"I dunno\" look and continued to try to convince us that the Playacar was better. By the way communication wasn't an issue, I speak Spanish. We told them that an \"upgrade\" would be one of the \"Palace resorts\" but he refused to send us there. He told us to call our travel agent. We booked our hotel through SellOff vacations, they use \"Bedsonline\" for their hotel bookings. Good luck if you ever have to deal with them. The call center is in India/you're constanly put on hold for long periods and they offered to put us in a Holiday Inn express!!! SellOff vacations completely washes their hand of any responsibility and I'm still waiting to talk to the manager from SellOff, She won't return my calls. We eventually gave up when I saw our 10 year old sitting on the bench outside crying, it just wasn't worth it. We were moved to the Riu Playacar. We asked for a room close to the beach. the first room we were given was tiny, we refused it. The second one was a bit bigger. Only 3 dresser drawers(tequila has 6). Everytime you turn on the tap or shower the bathroom area would smell of sewer. Our first day was a write off, we went to the dinning room and i just wanted to cry....it's nothing like the Tequilas. At least the food was good. (thank God) The next day we were at the front desk trying to make calls to find someone who might help us, that's when we found out each resort has a \"director\". We spoke to the Director of the Playacar, he made one phone call and told us we could go back to the Tequila on Monday. we arrived on a Friday morning. we moved into the Tequila Monday after 3:00. So that would have been 4 days into our vacation. He was very nice and also offered us the dinning room at the Tequila if we wanted to have dinner there instead. We were given a \"voucher\" for our next visit, but we still don't know if it's actually valid. so we'll wait and see. Our vacation was spoiled. By the time we got comfortable and into the swing of things it was time to go home. In response to an ealier review that complains of the noise by the pool...there are 2 sides to the pool area. One side is where all the activities take place and the music is playing. The other side is much quieter.

There was absolutely no escape from this noise. It was necessary to be up by 7.30 if you wanted a sunbed. The hotel was inundated at weekends with rowdy young single Americans and Mexicans and so the pool area became absolutely unbearable. The beach is an easy 7-8 min stroll away. It is big and beautiful but if you're not there by 9.30, you won't get a sunbed! The rooms are perfectly adequate and the food in the main buffet was fine, although beware if you are veggie, they put meat in EVERYTHING, even refried beans! The so called \"a la carte\" restaurants are actually buffet style and were GRIM, plus you had to be up by 7am to make a reservation!

This time around our travel agent Thomson is saying that due to new legislation the \"US Dollars are no longer accepted as a form of payment in the shops, bars & resturants\". Is this correct?

The staff there work VERY hard to make sure you have a comfortable and enjoyable stay and for us, they succeeded. The food was good, lots to choose from and something for everyone, from salads and fruit to beef and pork. I couldn't believe how hard the chefs worked to make the massive amounts of food everyday! Don't expect it to be exactly like home, it isn't. This is Mexico -- have an open mind and try new things. If you're very a very picky eater you might have a problem. The water is purified at the resort, so no worries about Mexican bacteria. The rooms were very clean and I felt the staff went above and beyond their call of duty to take care of every detail. The beds were comfortable, although a little on the firm side. I read one review where someone put a folded blanket under the sheets to make the bed a little softer. I didn't feel that was necessary, but you could try it if you think the bed is too hard. I have some back issues but slept very well every night I was there. The front desk staff were all very friendly and helpful. We requested a cot when we arrived and it was delivered before we even got to the room, all set up and made with bed linens. We requested an extra blanket one day and it was delivered as quickly as possible. Again, everyone went above and beyond. All of the drinks we tried were very good. We found that they were a little stronger at night than during the day. Not a bad idea actually -- I can't say I blame the staff for that! The beach is a short walk away, which we didn't mind at all. The Riu Yucatan hotel is on the beach and as a guest of the Riu Tequila you are entitled to the use of the Yucatan's facilities. We went to the beach most mornings and spent the afternoons at the Yucatan pool. The view of the beach from the pool was phenomenal. Finding chairs can be a bit of a challenge, however. It seems the people save chairs EARLY in the morning so they're guaranteed a place to sit. We did usually manage to find chairs and if not, we sat in the pool. Not a big deal to us. If you're looking for things to do you can schedule excursions in the hotel lobby. We visited the ruins in Tulum and went snorkeling in the reef and in two cenotes (fresh water caverns). You can also take a taxi to 5th Ave (costs $5 U.S. for the taxi) where there is lots of shopping... MUCH cheaper than at the hotel or the shops on the hotel complex. You can also take the ferry from 5th Ave. to Cozumel if you want to see the island. I highly recommend this hotel.

Overall impression: Fantastic, value for money. Extremely clean, friendly and good food! We arrived at the hotel on 15th February for 2 weeks. Room: Good size for a basic level. Very clean. Free safe box Minibar stacked up well daily with soft drinks and lager. Drinks optics with free Tequila, Gin, Rum & Vodka above mini bar. (If you like to drink lots of alcohol then this will be heaven for you!) Bathroom has a shower but no bath. Food On site the Tequila has an international buffet, an Asian buffet and a Steak House Restaurant. The below review is based on our individual opinions as always. We are not 'fussy eaters' Asian: We only went once: our opinion not for us. Clean and hot food but you can only really get good asian food in Asia! Steak House: This is the only restaurant service provided. Hot and very tasty food. We visited this twice. International: Excellent! Choices were plentiful. Food tasty and varied. Breakfast were fantastic. Hotel: This is a 5 star hotel for a very reasonable price. The staff were fantastic and friendly. The hotel is constantly being cleaned. Big complex with the luxury of having other Riu hotels within walking distance that you can also have food and drinks at. The Tequila is NOT situated on the beach but the beach is only a few minutes to walk and it gives you the opportunity of burning some of those excess calories after breakfast. Entertainment is good and not too amateurish! Cocktails both with and without alcohol are gorgeous. My favorite was a banana milkshake! Excursions: We booked to go on a tour with a local company that we found through Trip Advisor called Edventure Tours. Absolutely the best excursion you can do!! We paid $50 extra to have the private tour and went to Tullum ruins, swam with the sea turtles, visited the local known cenotes which are on a Mayan reserve! Last but not least swam in a local lagoon that is similar to Xel Ha! If you do decide to use this company, ask for Luis! He is absolutely fantastic. Xel Ha: Paid to visit this stunning natural aquarium. Also a MUST! Food excellent. Don't swim with the Dolphins or Manatees! Although the park is fantastic and they are preserving well, the DOLPHINS ARE GIVEN ANTI DEPRESSANTS TO KEEP THEM FROM BECOMING SO SAD THAT THEY DIE DUE TO BEING IN CAPTIVITY! Please don't help fund this by paying for the luxury of petting them!! The Manatees are also kept in a pool that is tiny for these huge gentle giants. We will definately be going back to this hotel!

We arrived fairly late in the day and were pleased with the excellent front desk and bellman's assistance in getting us to our room, a rather simple but spotless room facing away from the pool. The room was very quiet and was very clean. I especially liked the stocked mini-fridge with soft drinks and beer. The pool area was clean and very comfortable. We were able to find chaises almost every morning without all of the games of placing towels and then going to breakfast, but we saw plenty of people do it. The beach, a 10 minute walk from the lobby, or accessed via shuttle cart, was spectacular with white sand and the bluest water. We were always able to find lounge chairs in the shade of palms at any time of the day. The most outstanding part of this hotel is its staff. In the seven days we were there, every single staff member we met was helpful and friendly. Without exceptions. The other guests were generally considerate, although we saw one (American) couple angrily berate a bellman when they were unhappy that their room did not have the pool view they wanted. Approx. 80% of the guests were European, which gave the hotel a distinctly international feel. The biggest disappointment was the food; while there was plenty of it, the was little variety day to day and never a carving station for beef, ham, poultry or fish -- unlike similar resorts we have stayed at. We went into Playa del Carmen several nights for dinner and were glad that we did. One night we ate at the steak house at the resort - it was just ok but nothing special.

Following a 6 hour delay we arrived late at night, we were extremeley tired as had been up for 25 hours by the time we arrived at Cancun, got on coach at airport to find out something wrong with the coach, ' oh no' we thought not another delay, but no, 5 mins later another coach arrived and we were on our way, we were then dreading the check in as most of the coach were checking in at the Tequilla. What a shock when we arrived a table set up with envelopes with your name on and your room no. a sticky label to put on to your cases and porters ready to take your cases to your room. Iced Fruit punches were bought out to us and within 10 mins we were in our room. Opened the door to our room to find the table set for 2 with salmon /ham and cheese salads, bread rolls and a fridge full of cold drfinks, Wow the holiday had begun. The room was beautiful just smelt a bit musty but with the humidity what can you expect. We are both vegetarians and our usual diet on holiday is cheese and salad for 2 weeks , not here I hardly touched the salad bar for the whole 2 weeks as enough different variety of foods everyday to create a meal. You can create your own omelette at breakfast by choosing the ingredients that you want and passing them to the chef to cook for you, never waitied more than 5 minutes for this to be done, again for lunch and dinner you coulld create your own pasta meal by the same process. All staff at this hotel were most helpful, polite, talkative,funny and kind. the staff are very poorly paid and all tips are gratefully accepted. The Thomson Satff on site are not in the least pushy with the trips, but they have an excellent idea of recruiting local mexican reps as well as english reps, which meant if you wished to travel independantly they were able to help with all the right information as they know the area well. We hardly ever saw the shows at night as so exhausted by our daytime activities we were always late to dinner and only caught the last 10 mins of the shows, however everyone said how very good they were. We went to the disco 3 times and that was good fun, and the pool tables in the sports bar which was open 24 hours were always great for us. We also had 3 phone calls to our room during our stay from reception asking if we were happy did we need anything any additional drinks for the fridge. etc, Nice touch. There was also and Iron and ironing board in the wardrobe along with an umbrella which was required on more than 1 occaion in the evening. The thing I loved most about this hotel was the wildlife on our first morning we had visistors to our balcony, we had a room that backed on to the jungle and had acoaties come to our balcony everyday up to 30 at a time. There were Iguanas in the grounds and all sorts of beautiful birds, blue jays, red headed woodpeckers, Yellow birds. There were also cats,gekkos and some other animals that looked like squirrells without tails. The weather was a lot hotter that any review site I found, we passed a thermometer one day when we were out and that said 29 degrees and on our last day on the coach going back to the airport the temperature was showing as 35 degrees. The layout of this hotel reminded me of Disneys Typhoon Lagoon where everything was hidden so virtully no room could see the pool, this hotel had a very magical feel about it. Playacar resort is very safe it as least a couple of miles long and has security at all entrances and has a small shopping precinct and a golf cousre. The beach was wonderful and the sea could vary from very rough and wavy to much calmer depending on the wind. All non motorised were included in the price of the holiday, including life jackets, snorkels, goggles, Kayaks and Hobbie Cats. We went on 3 organised trips Xcaret, Xel Ha and the Jungle trip which is to take a speed boat by yourself out through the mangroves on the lagoon at Cancun and on to a reef to snorkel, we had a 5 foot Barracuda in the water with us. We also travelled independantly to Akumal Bay to swim with the turtles and that was such a thrill. We took a taxi from the hotel for 300 pesos each way and the driver came back for us 4 hours later. Approx 18 pesos to the pound at present. We felt safe the whole time we were in Mexico and never felt threatened. The USD is wideley accepted in this part of mexico amd all trips are priced in it.. This part of Mexco feels like a Giant playground mainly for adults, I think of it as the adult version of Disney world in florida.

Great Food, great layout, fantastic staff and the Entertainment team never stop from Morning to night. West end style productions the best in house entertainment team bar none. Beach is reached by a short walk if your fit or stretch golf cart if your not. wide soft cool sand and sunbeds even at a lazy 11 am, even at the The pools as well. You can use two other Riu's if you fancy a change. And two in cancun if you fancy a day out. There's a reef and less crowded stretch of beach to the Right of the Yucatan if your willing to walk a bit. The Disco tends to open between 11:15 and 11:30 not the advertised 11Pm. But when it was opened it rocked. There are 3 Specialist restaurants. But to be honest the main restaurant had more than enough Choice. The wine is variable so you may get something ok or something to strip paint with. I stuck to the Tinto which was ususly fine. Playacar has changed in the six years since we last stayed here. 5th street has expanded and some of the new buildings lack charector. On the upside Carlos and Charlie's was great, as was Senior Frogs and Bongos is a blast. Although we can't help feeling that Bongos will put a lot of the smaller clubs out of business. Information on the internet regarding clubs is out of date, I had four places we looked for ,which had been closed down two years or more. Gone are such as the Mambo club on 6th and we failed to find Wine and She's on calle Corazone. Beware the scammers who'le spot your RIU arm band and tell you they're a waiter there but its his day off and would you like to look at his new jewelry business? You can hop a ferry to Cozumel independantly. Bus's run to all the major sites for a fraction of the cost of a tour operators but check the return times. Tulum can be done independantly just get off at the stop before the town. Xcaret is great as is their spectacular evening show. Bur Coba and Chichenitza are a bit of a mission.

Then 2 hours bus ride stopping at too many other hotels before we finally arrived at the Tequila at about 3am. Absolutely ridiculous - the Riu hotels in PlayaCar should get there own transportation. And the Mexican government needs to wake up and realize that lousy service makes people pick other counties for vacations.. This was our 2nd trip - my wife and I went last year. This year our two adult (20's) sons came with us, and we met another couple there. The hotel is as good as it was last year - lots of variety in food. Service fantastic. Grounds immaculate. The walk to the beach would be tough for people with little kids but should be no problem for most adults - it's less than 1KM. Entertainment staff are enthusiastic and actually look like they enjoy their jobs (several were there last year). Evening shows - mixed. Some very lame, others quite entertaining.They only stock the mini fridge every other day - and never left enough beer, and no juices - just pop and lots of bottled water. Our room was clean, but near the main highway so noisy with traffic starting at 6:30am. Otherwise acceptable - not really five stars but clean, well maintained and enough space. Return trip was just as painful as the outbound one - 2 hour bus ride, over an hour waiting to check in (Sunquest - get Thomas Cook to hire more checkin agents). We barely had time to go through the duty free and had no time to buy food - by the time we got to the gate (running) - the plane was already boarding. Arrival back in Toronto was great - bags waiting for us and no lineups at Canada Customs. Their employee welcomed us back home and was friendly and helpful. So to summarize - hotel and food great.

The only downside to the rooms was the curtain sepearating the bathroom,no light in the shower and personally i would have preferred coffee making facilities to optics .

All were good although we didn find you had to be up early to book these !!! The grounds of the hotel are superbly maintained and all staff are friendly and work extremely hard throughout the complex. We did eat out on two occassions and i would highly recommend Kool fish on 5th Avenue near 38th ( coconut shrimp to die for !!!) .

I was a little disappointed with the A La Carte Restaurants (ate at the Steak house one night and could barely eat the steak) but the Buffet made up for it! Every night the buffet has a different theme so the food is constantly changing. Breakfast is well worth getting up early for! They make the best omelets :) The beach is not right on the resort but it's only a 10 minute walk away and your walking through a safe path. When going to the beach for the day you can use the bars, restaurants and bathrooms at the Yucatan so you don't have to walk back to Tequila. The sand on the beach is incredibly soft and some how manages not to get too hot! The beach was absolutely amazing and they have staff going around collecting empty cups and garbage at all times so it stays clean. The entertainment staff put on a fantastic show every night! They will also take you out to the bars at night and provide transportation to the bars for you. Coco Bongo is a definite must see! The grounds are kept very clean and you feel as if your walking in a jungle.. I wouldn't suggest feeding any of the animals as you will get swarmed by them but they seemed safe and friendly! You can walk to Playa Del Carmen in about 30 minutes or take a $5 USD taxi. We took the ferry over to Cozumel and went snorkeling on the Coral Reefs.. lots of exciting stuff to see! There were only a few downsides.. the 24hr snacks are cold sandwiches and fruit (I was happy to at least have something but it would of be nice to have a small kitchen open at night) The wine does taste awful as other reviews pointed out.. I didn't think this would bother me but at dinner they come around to serve you wine. (The white is better than the red!) Finally.. the resort is filled with families and couples. We were two single mid twenties girls and luckily met a group from Spain to party with. If you aren't going as a family, couple or large group you might find the hotel nightlife a little boring.

One thing that i would say that was the only disappointment (but not major) was that the sun would be gone from the pool by 3.30pm, this may be because the time of the year with the sun going down earlier, but it just meant that we would actually get up and do something (drinking at the pool bar mostly :-) Absolutely fantastic holiday we will be going back next year!

Would I recommend it to my friends? Certainly. Our room 2128 was on the ground floor at the back of the resort, with a view from the side over the golf course and fronting on trees. It was perfectly adequate, but a bit tired looking, although absolutely clean. The beds were quite comfy and we were grateful for the extra blankets. It was unseasonably chilly with cloud from the 21st to about the 25th January. Next time I go to Mexico I\u2019ll go for the last two weeks of February to be sure of good weather. A word of warning about the coatis (ring tailed lemurs). In spite of warnings all over the place to not feed the animals, I gave in to temptation and fed one from my ground floor balcony. It was very cute and took my offering very gently, within half a minute I had three coatis snuffling for treats and then 40 appeared making a beeline for me. As they swarmed over the balcony wall I beat a hasty and rather guilty retreat. Other wildlife is agoutis, iguanas and cheeky jackdaw type birds that will lift your breakfast from your plate given half a chance. The hotel is only a 7 minute stroll to the beach. Those with disabilities or just bone idle can take the buggy. There are plenty of loungers on the beach and around the pool. They're not always in the right place but they're easy to move. Playa del Carmen is about 45 minutes walk along the beach and about 35 minutes along the road. Quite pleasant to do a there and back once a day. Otherwise take a taxi at \u00a32.00 each way. There is a bird sanctuary half way to town but the entrance fee was 300pesos, about \u00a316.50 each, so we gave it a miss. We enjoyed the Thomson\u2019s trip to the Chichen Itza temple complex. BUT it took 3 hours in total to get to the first stop which was the famous sink hole. For the first hour we picked up passengers and then drove 100 miles or so. We had an informative video to watch, tea, coffee and soft drinks were provided as well as breakfast pastries. Drinks and pastries were provided on the way back. We had 45 minutes at the cenote, a sink hole. 160 feet deep and quite cold, but well worth the effort. Floatation jacket and towels are provided. Lunch is at a restaurant about 10 minutes away. Quite ok quality, salad and cooked pork or chicken+ puddings. Hot tortillas are served at the table. Drinks are charged separately. We had about 2 1/2 hours at the temples. Our guide Alfonso apparently trained as an archaeologist and works as a government tour guide. He seemed to know his stuff. He'll take you to a couple of stalls and chat about the Mayan calendar but there is no pressure to buy. We went back and bought, but probably wouldn't have done with hindsight. I think the handcrafted work is actually mass produced. The return journey was another 3 hours and as a once in a lifetime trip it was worth it. I found the Thomson reps, including Andrew, to be polite, well turned out and helpful. The woman rep suggested we buy tickets to Excaret and make our own way by taxi. Taxi fares are government regulated and cost 145pesos there and 140pesos back for two people. We bought the Excaret Plus option. Well worth it. Unless you spend a long time at the beach, most of it can be seen in a day. There are jungle paths which wind around each other so the park seems bigger than it is, I felt bad about the wild animals- they really didn't have enough room. But they all seemed well fed and didn't appear stressed, so who knows? The aquarium is great and the river swim is a must do. We went to Cancun on the bus. It took 1 Hour and cost 42 pesos each, each way. Unfortunately we got off at \u201cdowntown\" which isn't a tourist area. It was raining and not too warm so we took a taxi to Plaza las Americas which is a standard shopping mall and then had to take a taxi back to the bus station. Cancun's a good place to go apparently so do your research first! I like Mexico because the people are genuinely friendly and helpful; hygiene standards are higher than in many parts of the UK and tourist areas appear safe. There is no harassment of tourists, which after Egypt and India and the Caribbean is a relief.

Everything was fine about the hotel except for the room, which was excessively damp and probably caused or at least contributed to a chest infection that I developed. The damp is not as I have read in other reviews due to improper use of the air con as I have spent a large part of my working life living in air conditioned accommodation in the tropics and have never come across a room as damp as this. The damp is probably due to the design of the rooms - the bedroom is separated from a dressing area by a curtain and the shower is off the dressing area, again separated by only a curtain. Any moist air that accumulates in the dressing area as a result of taking a shower, or even running a basin of hot water really has nowhere to go...there is no extractor fan in the dressing area, only the intake for the Air Con which if turned on just serves to shift the problem to the main bedroom. Keeping the outside door open aids in airing the room, but my room was on the ground floor adjacent to the main path, which normally wouldn't bother me, but does mean that for the sake of privacy the doors/curtains have to remain closed. The result of this was that bedding and clothes always felt like they had just been taken out of a steam room, also some tablets that I had left in a pocket of the jacket I wore to travel in (and didn't wear during the holiday) had turned to mush when I put the jacket on to go home. Apart from the damp I had no other real problems with the hotel, all the staff were very friendly and cheerful, the variety and quality of the food was a better than I had expected for the price I paid for the holiday, The room was kept immaculately clean. Service at the bars was relatively quick, even at the busiest of times which is not always the case on AI holidays. It was nice to see the pool staff removing towels from sunloungers that had been \"reserved\". It was also good to see a mixture of nationalities and ages, without one group predominating. I would recommend this a a good cheap and cheerful holiday, apart from the room....if you do decide to stay I would see if you can get either an upstairs room, or one that is well back from the main pathway.", "Date": "February 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brighton, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel!\u201d", "Author": "ecamp100", "ReviewID": "UR96361377", "Content": "Hi, Just arrived back yesterday from 11 nights at the Riu Tequila wife my wife and had a top hoiday at what we would both describe as a really good hotel. It is a big hotel that caters for a lot of guests so if its a quiet hotel you're wanting then best to look elsewhere. The staff work amazingly hard and the whole place is super clean. Rooms are nice and and although there are old style TV's and the shower is a touch dark, as some previous reviews mentioned, surely if thats the worst people can find wrong tells you something? Various bars that all serve lovely cocktails. They serve local spirits but if you're fussy for a brand ie Smirnoff vodka then they will supply it. Food wise the hotel really is excellent. Breakfast and dinner have tons of choice and are really good quality. Luch has slightly less choice but is still really nice, not just ''burger and chips'' as another recent review moaned. We also ate twice in both the steak house and asian buffet which were both excellent. The location of the hotel is good and as I'm sure your aware its a few minutes walk from the beach seems to bother some people. If it does then book another hotel. Why people moan about something thats well advertised in the hotel description is a mystery! Just a word of warning: The beach is beautiful but is very busy so bear in mind you'll be sharing it with a lot of other holidaymakers! Same with the pool area. One small thing that did annoy both of us was alot lot of the sunlongers were reserved with towels by 7.30 am yet some sat empty until a lot later in the morning. Signs up everywhere asking peole not to do it but wasn't enforced. Not a big gripe. Playa Del Carmen is a fairly nice resort with a quite a few nice bars and restuarants. It also has a huge number of tourist tat shops if you like that kind of thing! I hope this description helps people to make up their mind about booking a holiday at the Tequila. What annoys me is the people that complain passionately about fairly trivial things. Its not the best hotel in Mexico but neither is it the most expensive so my advice to people who didn't like their stay is next time pay alot more money and stay in a posher hotel.

This is our fifth different all-inclusive resort that we have stayed at and the Tequila was equal to or better than all the others in almost every area. The location of the resort (although it is off the beach about a five minute walk) is in a very nice area and is close enough to walk to 5th Avenue (about 30 minute walk). We made this walk with our two children (12 and 7) and really enjoyed this as there are small ruins along the way to explore. Having access to two other RIU's was also nice and we used the facilities at the Yucatan alot during the day as this is located on the beach. The food was good although the majority of meals are buffet unless you book one of the ala cartes in the morning. We found the buffets had alot of variety and they changed the menu every night with a different theme. We did find the boooking of the ala cartes to be a bit of a hassle but one that we were able to easily live with. The rooms were nice, well cleaned, and they continually restocked the mini-bar on a daily basis. The entertainement at night was pretty much equal to what we have experienced with other all-inclusives nothing too great but a nice way to end the day. The only real complaint that we have is the Sports bar could be utilized a little better. Most of the time there was very few people using the sports bar and this is probably because it lacks atmosphere and they charge 30 pesos for a game of pool. We would definitely return to the resort in the future and feel that the beach was by far the best beach that we have been at. We have stayed in Cancun, Akumal, and Punta Cana and this beach and swimming area was the nicest that we have seen.", "Date": "February 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cAlmost Perfect\u201d", "Author": "Gary_Francois", "ReviewID": "UR95605933", "Content": "This was a great place!

Pros: Clean Good service Food was pretty good Awesome beach with plenty of chairs and shade from Palm Trees Cons: No wait staff to bring you drinks on the beach or at the pool (Get them yourselves) Only one golf cart that holds 6 people to bring you to the beach and it closes from 1 to 3. Suggestions -Bring an insulated container for your drinks. That way you only need to fill it up a few times during the day. -Bring a lot of sunscreen -Bring some nicer clothes for the evening. Guys bring nice shorts and a clean tee or polo, Women were dressed really nice! -Take bread at lunch from the restaurant and feed the fish in the ocean, lot's of fun!!

As a matter of fact, I am still there as of this writing. Before it was at Negril, Jamaica. I also stayed at several Cancun/Riveira Maya all inclusives, therefore I have something to compare to.I believe that some of the fantastic reviews are based on no experience though. I would not give RIU Tequila five or even four stars because it just does not make it for US standards and so is my rating. My first disappointment \u2013 the resort is NOT ON THE BEACH, not even close to one. You have to cross a busy road and then walk along a stretch of a sister resort RIU Yucat\u00e1n to get there (or ride a cart). Somehow I was expecting staying at a beach side resort and there was nothing in the description at the Orbitz site that would have warned me about that. I should have paid more attention to the reviews at TripAdvisor.com that reveal the dark secret. . I took the 4.5 rating without a grain of salt. Too bad. So walking we were. Some would find it as a benefit - get rid of some extra calories, but when you have a child and your knee hurts, even a limited cart service does not always compensate. BEACH \u2013 once you get to the beach, you should love it unless you have non-traditional expectations. It is wide, has no rocks or sharp shells and the sand is white and fine. If you like a good shade, you need to get your vacationing butt out of the bed early to leave a towel where you want to lay down for the day to \u201creserve\u201d it or you may be sorry. You must get your towels at Tequila and carry them with you. If you like seclusion at the beach, then forget it \u2013 you will be competing for space with residents of several sister resorts that have no own beach and come to one stripe that is not very wide. On the other hand, for those who likes to be in a crowd and activities, like beach volleyball, it may be a plus. Their water sports equipment is old and worn out. You can arrange a snorkeling trip, but they have no pier to load a boat and I was watching with horror how people with snorkeling gear were fighting the waves to get to the boat that was bouncing up and down showing its bottom. Snorkeling at the hotel\u2019s beach \u2013 no luck, the sea floor is sand only. ROOMS are clean, spacious, have balconies that often face another building at an angle or trees. Forget about an ocean view. My room has a separate toilet, stand-in shower and a small room that has a closet, a sink, a fixture with four bottles with hard liquor and a refrigerator that has 4 beers, several cans with club soda, carbonated water and several bottles of Pepsi brand soda. Those are refilled once in two days. TV is an old style tube and has about 25+ analog channels, including several in Spanish. Room has a balcony with a couple of plastic chairs. Internet is available only in the lobby, WIFI only. TERRITORY is well maintained and has tree-shaded alleys. You may occasionally see various exotic animals around \u2013 they are no harm and cute. FOOD \u2013 below expectations when compared to other comparatively priced all-inclusives that we have been to in Riviera Maya/Cancun and Jamaica. Frankly, if you like dining at a Golden Corral for the entire duration of your trip, then you should be fine. Day by day we have been offered pretty much the same variety. If you look for something a bit more upscale or tasty, look for another place to stay. Restaurants \u201cfor reservations only\" are not much different from buffets in quality of food or wine or service. Having that same cheap wine from the same \u201cbarrel\u201d and not from a bottle was the sign of not meeting the five stars or even four stars ranking to me. My 6 ounces (!!!) of medium rare rib eye at Lupita restaurant was thin sliced, all grey inside and dry and burnt on the outside. I think that ribs and chicken at that place were more enjoyable. My wife asked for cognac and was told they have none, she got brandy that did not smell like a moonshine, therefore acceptable. I asked for Irish Cream and was told they have none, but was offered a Baileys :-). That Baileys had the darker component separated from the cream at the bottom of the glass. Go figure what you are puttiing inside of you... STAFF \u2013 people here work hard for their money. So I did not mind leaving tips when they were going for an extra mile. My daughter had a birthday while we have stayed at RIU. Once the restaurant manager Leo have learned about the occasion, he arranged a reservation at the busiest restaurant at the prime time and our room was decorated with balloons, animals made of towels and a small gift accompanied by a standard letter from the management. Noticeable is the art of curving watermelons at the restaurant. Very few staff members speak good English, even those who face customers. GUESTS \u2013 a large number of them, I would say 70% or more are not from North America. Latin America, Eastern and Western Europe have noticeable presence. About 50% are couples over 45. That still was not a problem when we needed to find people to play beach volleyball or water polo. There were only a few topless sunbathers and most of them are loosing a battle to gravity.

Loads of activities throughout the day to keep you busy at the hotle and at the beach which was my favourite place to be just beautiful. My time spent there went way to quickly. The food was very nice and could always find something to eat being abit of a fussy eater. We ate in the main restaurant most nights where there was always planty on offer the fresh fish being my favourite. We also ate in he steak house one night for one of our partties birthdays so we got an advance booking (if you want to at in one of the three restaurants you have to book in the morning and mot people are up and booking by 7 so be up early if you want to eat there) they made the night very special and the food was also very good. one bad thing about the main restuarants is that allot of people do not know how to queue and jsut pushed in but you son know how the culprits are so dont let them so annoying!!! The entertinment staff were very good and put on some really good shows with crazy james being my favourite, if you are going you will find out why he is truly crazy. The wether was nice for our stay had a few cloudy days but was still hot so was nice to have a break from the heat every now and again. Allot of the shops in the town take dollars and everything is priced in dollars but they will all also take pesos. In the hotel they have some stalls every other night that sell the same things as the shops but at twice the price, also on the beach you may have one or two visitors that are actually cheaper than both so you could get a few bargains and if you say no they dont hassle you.

I'm a 30 year old male who traveled with two other friends and the three of us had an AMAZING time. We don't have one bad thing to say. The food, service, entertainment and attractions were truly five star. The staff was so friendly and after you meet them the first day, you continue to see them day after day which makes saying goodbye difficult. We mainly dined in the buffet as there was so much selection, but we did make reservations at the steak house two nights. Soooo good and the timely service was perfect. They took seven and nine o'clock reservations but you want to make sure you get up first thing in the morning (7am) to head to the main restaurant to make the reservation. Fills up very quickly. We didn't use the pool once, although it was beautiful...the beach was where we wanted to be. The water was turquoise and the limestone sand was never too hot on the feet. Unlike the pool, you don't need to head to the beach super early, there are plenty of chairs to choose from if you make it there before noon. We did two excursions (The Snorkeling Adventure and Coba). Both were great, but keep in mind the times aren't always accurate. Our Coba trip was suppose to have us return to the resort around 5pm, but we didn't make it back until 7. There are plenty of stops at other resorts to pick up and drop off other people taking the excursion. It wasn't that much of an issue, but it's something you may not be told. Also, if you snorkel...don't forget your towel (I did). I was pretty cold when I got back on the boat from the first part of the snorkel that I wasn't ready to go into the water again before the second part of the excursion. There were many families at the resort but the ages ranged so much that we didn't feel out of place. Although there were plenty of children, we never were annoyed. If you go...you MUST check out Coco Bongo. We were really amazed by this club and didn't get back to the resort until 5AM (our choice). We paid $60.00 through the resort workers which included transportation there, line bypass, and open bar. We also had a VIP area on the floor. You will not be disappointed.

I expected our dinners with reservations to be a nice experience where you order off a menu and the presentation as well as the taste are spectacular.

Additionally, I felt they had some very nice entertainment at the Occidental...they had a Mexican Fiesta one night outside and brought in an authentic Mariachi Band. What a performance!! The other down side of staying at the Tequilla is that you have almost a 1/2 mile walk to get to the beach (it seemed like a mile) I would much rather be on the beach side.

Arrived at the hotel and I thought I had landed in paradise. Rooms were spacious and always clean and re-stocked everyday. Beach was a short walk away (bus optional) but after eating all of the lovely food- a walk to the beach was a good idea. Only small areas of the pool were in the sunlight for most of the day but this was not a problem when there was a huge beach in the sun. Use of the beach snack and drinks bar and pool at the Yucatan was a great idea as we did not return to the Tequila until the sun went down. Entertainment was top class- the majority of performers have been to dance/drama schools and this really showed in the performances. As a few people have mentioned, the wine was undrinkable unless you have no taste buds! But when there was a choose over over 100 other drinks, you can't grumble. Food was excellent- variety, option to eat in themed restaurants as well as having themed nights and specials in the main buffet restaurant. Excursions- Swan with dolphins, did the Fatcat Catamaran trip and Jungle Tour. The first two were great and definately worth the money. The day we went on the Jungle tour it involves 1 hour speedboat and 1 hour snorkelling, due to the port being closed in Cancun the snorkelling part was cancelled but we were only informed of this after a 2 hour journey to Cancun (pick ups on the way). The company had called the hotel but offered us 2 hour speedboat instead. Speaking to the Thomson rep on our return all he was bothered about was ensuring he didn't receive the message and did not care that we had paid Thomson's for a trip that was not provided. Our return was delayed by 12 hours due to bad weather in the UK. My grumble is not at the hotel but with the Thomson staff. They finish work at 7pm- at this point our flight had been delayed twice that day and we were told that the plane had left Birmingham. We were due to be collected at 9pm, waiting for the coach at 9pm in reception and the poor receptionist had to be the bearer of the bad news, we would now be collected at 2am (8 hours after check out from the rooms). My main issue is with the Thomson staff, not that the flight was delayed as weather cannot be controlled but customer service can. The Thomson rep's all day had said the flight was delayed leaving birmingham but when we arrived at Cancun airport the flight had never left Birmingham and it was coming from Manchester! Dropped off at Cancun airport by a rep who had come back into work to ensure we were all ok, and informed us that in departures there was food and refreshments- another lie as EVERYTHING is closed until 6/7am. We were unable to get even a glass of water. By this point everyone had been awake almost 24 hours and had been constantly lied to all day. We eventually boarded the plane at 7am hungry/tired and thirsty and very glad to be on the way home. NOTE: you cannot spend Mexican peso's on the aeroplane and unless you are in premium seats- drinks are not included on the long haul flight. I would definately return to Mexico and even to this hotel as 2 weeks all inclusive did not start to get boring!

Don't forget to carry a banana around, you never know who you'll meet on your way to the beach.

The buffet restaurant is amazing there is something for every food taste, you won't be disappointed. I personally think one of the best features of Riu Tequila is that as an all inclusive guest you can use other Riu hotels in the Playacar complex as well as in the Tequila. There is a gym & Spa in the Riu Yucatan (just over the road). The beach is beautiful and the sea is clear what more could you want, there's even a free golf buggy to take you up and down to the beach every day if you so wish!!!

This was our third visit to this resort. it was every bit as good as it was the first time we stayed here 10 years ago. Where do you begin, people who complain about this resort are people who aren't happy unless they are complaining about something. Everything from the lobby staff, resturant staff, cooks, grounds, and entertainment team were great! Alway with a smile and always saying hola. The food was top notch and could always find something good to eat. Ate at the steakhouse once and it was great. The breakfest and lucnch resturants were also really good and you could and always find lots to eat. The dinner buffet had theme nights and there were some dishes that were repeated, but there were alot of different dishes too. On our second last day, received a letter under our door from the head chef inviting us to a special dinner at the steakhouse resturant to thank us for the loyalty to the company and asked us to reply by the next morning which we did. The special dinner prepared for us consisted of steak, seafood and special dessert They had a band and welcome drinks for us also.That is how you treat your repeat customers, as your best referrals are from repeat customers. The beach was excellent as always. The bars were good especially Rosie at the pool bar, always smiling and treating everyone well whether they tipped or not. Room was always spotless and a nice towel animal was left every other day. Mini fridge restocked every other day. Noticed one day early in the morning staff went around removing towels from loungers that were reserved before people went for breakfest, they left a little note to try and stop this. I personally thought this was great. Lots of wildlife around the resort, some would eat out of your hands. Everything was clean at the resort from resturants to tables by the pools, to the lobby and the bars. All in all I would recommend this resort to everyone. It is good for families, and couples. You cannot go wrong with this resort. On a side note we took the kitchen tour one day and the cleanliness of the kitchens were unbelievable, everything was spotless in all area's. There also we were treated to cooled champagne and tasty treats. If all goes well we will be returning to this resort next year for a fourth visit and will not hesitate one bit to book it again.

The breakfast buffet had everything you could possibly desire, but I especially liked the cooked to order omelets and pancakes. Our server, Hilario, was excellent. The dinner and lunch buffer were good as well. Our room was very nice and our housekeeper, Nelly, was very efficient. The animals she arranged from towels were adorable. We were provided with large bottles (3-4) bottles of water every 2 days along with soft drinks and the in-room bar. The room was exceptionally clean. The pool areas were spacious and were constantly being cleaned. The beach was a short walk (5 min) or you could catch the shuttle if you preferred.

This was our 5th visit so were well aware of what to expect. The last time we stayed here was 8 years ago and to be honest very little had changed. This is by far one of the best value for money hotels l have ever stayed in. It really does tick all the boxes for food, drink, entertainment, location, cleanness, hard working staff, climate, l could go on and on but l think you get the idea. The beach which is in walking distance just a short walk over the road from the hotel is still one of the best beaches l have been on. The clear blue waters are just stunning with white sand and plenty of sun beds to go round. This is a hotel where you can dress down in the day but dress up by night. In fact the hotel encourage you to dress up for dinner and it is nice to see people making an effort. Our stay was over Christmas so there were plenty of gala dinners which were fantastic. On the downside our rooms were damp, the bed was wet at night and our clothes were also wet and damp from being in the room. They did offer to change our rooms to be fair but we declined as we had unpacked and did no want all the upheaval. One guest we spoke to had changed rooms 3 times. I must add this is not a problem with all the rooms only a small amount so best to check rooms fully on arrival and check for damp. My room smelt of stale smoke. As a non smoker this was very unpleasant indeed. The hotel need to make some changes where they could make an effort to rent rooms out for smokers and ones for non smokers. Another change the hotel should consider making is to take out the old fashioned optics and put in tea/coffee making facilities . This would make a huge difference to guests who like nothing more then their morning coffee or tea. The walk to the restaurant can be quite far where tea/coffee is available but by the time you have got back to the room its cold. Although the riu has gone through some refurbishment it still has some work to do when it comes to the rooms. They have old fashioned television that would be obsolete in this country, old fashioned d\u00e9cor and dowdy curtains and bed covers. The bed was uncomfortable with a poor mattress and bed linen. No internet access in rooms only in lobby area. These rooms need to be brought up to standard...a little goes a long way and by making these changes bring them up to standard of other hotels in the area. The rooms however were cleaned daily, the tv old as it was....did work and if anything was wrong with the room someone was there almost immediately. The animation staff worked so hard and are a credit to the hotel. The nightly shows they put on are just as good as any London production. The down side to this is the shows don't start until 10pm so for two hours while waiting they entertain the children and hand out prizes for the days events which can be long winded to be honest. What is missing is a cocktail bar away from the main concert where you could chill out while waiting for the main show...this would be exceptionally welcome for those people who have not got children. A visit to the main town is highly recommended just 50pesos to get there and it just goes on and on forever with shops, restaurants, beach and night-life.

We usually go to Playa every year and have stayed at other all inclusives but the last few years we rented a place. I have to say I was looking forward to being in one place that had everything. Overall the stay was very good. The Good - the lobby is awesome. It's very spacious and bright and well decorated. The free wifi is a huge bonus. I as many others, enjoyed spending a good half hour a day sipping banana mama;s and checking email on my iphone. - the pool is great - the restaurant by the pool has great food - the grounds are beautiful, tropical lush paradise - food ( sub category now...) the food was overall very good. Obviously after 10 days you want something else. But for the first good 7 days we enjoyed the buffet. We never made it to the a la carte. I usually go to Mexico on a mission to get the most authentic Mexican food I can and gorge on it! I loved that every buffet had guacamole and it was amazing! We ate the Mexican food daily and loved it. We also enjoyed the fries, burgers , crepes etc...... Only dissapointment on the food end of things were the desserts and wine. The desserts were often just medicore, one night they had a good chocolate cake and carrot cake but other nights not so much. The wine as others have stated is awful. But all other drinks are great. The Bad - I can't believe the 24 hr \"snack bar\" has no real food. The snacks are in a fridge and are microwavable burgers, hot dogs and fruit plates and sandwhich. Really dissapointed this resort had no real food for those that come back late at night and want a snack. I was also dissapointed that the main restaurant Jalisco closed at 10:30 am. I mean we didn't go out all the time but some nights we did and sometimes you want to sleep in a little and not be rushed at breakfast. - the rooms - first, I can't believe there was tons of liqour etc....in our room but no coffee maker!! I'm a huge fan of my AM coffee and often need a few before I can think of eating. I was not impressed to have to go to the main restaurant for my coffee. - the room itself is an OK size and although a bit dated , I wasn't expecting much for the price we paid. I will say that the biggest concern and what almost ruined my trip was the mold that I found. I got really chesty and had trouble breathing one day and I know I'm very allergic to mold, so I went on a hunt. Sure enough, I found mold in the bathroom shower- all over the cieling. The black fuzzy toxic kind. I mean I was breathing this in for a few days. I got really sick as a result. I went to front desk and they sent someone to \"clean it\". Basically they scrubbed it off and that was that. With mold though, it's ususally under what you see. I got worse . A day later with a fever and breathing problems I asked to be moved. The front desk staff were pretty useless. They didn't seem to really get why this was such a big deal. I also don't get why they don't have a proper fan and all that wood in a highly humid bathroom! They did change us to a newer updated room, that was much much better. Far less humidity and smell and no mold. I was still sick but at least slept well knowing there was no mold! The new room had one small problem though, the AC was barely working.....very weak! And although the nights before had been cooler ....this night was hot! So we just sucked it up adn slept with teh balcony door open! At that point it was the lessor of the two evils. Apart from my room debacle, the hotel itself is great. Awesome staff in restaurants and bars, great food, location is perfect. Beach is amazing and it's not a far walk at all...in fact after eating so much it's a nice welcome to walk!!!! I think that helps a lot .

Overall the resort and our experience was very good. It took a total of 3 hours from the time we landed to get to the resort. This was because the lines at customs were very long but it moved smoothly and that the van ride took over an hour to get there. Avoid the people inside the airport outside the customs area - they are trying to sell you something. All the pickup transportation is located outside. We got our room right away. We were located in building 1900 which was away from everything and was very quiet but it was a long walk to and from the main building. We basically spent our days at the Rui Yucatan resort which is across the street (8 - 10 minute walk or there is a shuttle) because we wanted to be near or at the beach so we could play beach volleyball. We were able to get beach chairs each day overlooking the beach and water. The beach is located down a flight of stairs. You have to get there around 8 am to save those premier spots. We also participated in their silly games, and sat at the pool bar drinking. At the end of the day we would head back to the Riu Tequila to shower & change for dinner. The water at both the pool and ocean was cool but it didn\u2019t take long to get used to the water. The bartenders were really attentive with no waiting for a drink order even when they were really busy. We would be asked several times for a drink order while we waited for our drinks from other bartenders. At the poolbar at the Riu Yucatan, the bartender, Filimon, was great - he would give us another drink before we finished our last one. The \"playmakers\" were fun. The nightly shows were amateurish but not bad. You had to make reservations at 7 am SHARP for the specialty restaurants since people lined up that early to secure their reservations - not a problem for us. The Asian, Mexican and Steakhouse restaurants were all very good. We went to the buffet a couple of nights and it was excellent as well. But please note that we are all \"meat & potato\" eaters so we are happy as long as it is decent tasting. The Breakfast & lunch buffets were very average and typical for all inclusives - basically the same every day. One side note is that we missed one day getting a reservation and just showed up at the Asian restaurant and still got in since someone cancelled/didn\u2019t show up (suggested by the front desk).

It was not one of the best holidays I have ever had( purely due to being ill). Nothing to do with the Hotel just bad luck and being run down after Gatwick Airport chaos. My entire trip seemed to be cursed from the start with bad luck. This 2 week holiday was very special as I have not had a 2 week holiday with my husband for over 12 years due to his work. So it was a big deal for us both. The problems started with the snow and our flight being delayed for over 34 hours. We booked our holiday with First Choice and when our flight was delayed we got no help and the person behind the help desk was rude and just walked off just leaving hundreds of confused passengers standing there, not knowing what was going on or what to do and where to go. We will be writing to First Choice to claim our Hotel money back which we had no help in booking at all and telling them how bad people were treated at the Airport. So after getting to Riu Tequila 2 days late we were determined to enjoy the rest of our trip and were pleased with what we saw. The transfer was quick(just over one hour) and we were shown to our room straight away and had our luggage bought to our room . Rooms The rooms were much larger than I imagined and the beds were massive and not too hard or soft, just right. We had a quiet room near the pool, but facing the Golf Course and Jungle and the noise was minimal. The balcony overlooked trees and palms and was very private. ( room 2815). The room also had a TV with a few good channels on and a fridge and optics in the bathroom. The wardrobes were also in the bathroom area. There was also an iron and ironing board and hairdryer and a large walk in shower and seperate loo. The rooms were cleaned very well indeed every day and the fridge restocked every second day with beer, water, soft drinks etc. If you did not want your room cleaned that day, just hang your Do Not Disturb sign up outside which I did 2-3 times due to being ill. The rooms were cleaned so well I tipped every other day. I am glad the room was comfy as I spent half my holiday in it being ill. The Pool The pool area was in 2 halves and one was the action half and the other was the relaxing half. The restaurant where we eat lunch was in the middle and it became The Steakhouse at night. The bar here was good and buffet lunches were tasty and there was always loads of food on offer. I found the pool too cold to swim in but was happy just laying on a sunbed sipping Pina Coladas. It was hard finding beds in the sun though as people were getting up early and putting towels on them. It was like musical chairs trying to lay in the sun as the day went on and many areas of the pool became shaded. The pool area has beautiful gardens and trees and umbrellas for shade. Spent quite a bit of time around the pool. Lobby and Breakfast, Evening Buffet The Lobby was very large and had loads of comfy sofas and seating. The lobby was a nice place to chill out and relax and I enjoyed checking my emails via my Iphone while having a cool refreshing drink. They even had electric plugs for your phones, laptops while you surfed away. The lobby had loo's and a small shop selling snacks and a few gifts and toiletries. I had to buy some Imodium from here as I had a bad tummy last 2 days of my holiday. The little shop was very handy. First Choice Reps were also based in the lobby and were helpful and friendly . The bar next to the stage was very good and made the strongest drinks in the Hotel( we found the next best drinks were at the pool and the weakest and not so nice drinks down at the beach). We did not watch the nightly entertainment but used the bar during the day and only once at night. From the lobby you can walk to a nice Plaza along tree lined street in 3 minutes which has a Chemist and Starbucks and a few other shops etc. The breakfasts in the lobby restaurant were very good. There were cooking stations and so much food to choose from. Think my favourite meal was breakfast times. Evening buffet meals were also good and the choice was massive, but I just got bored with it night after night after night. We booked the Steak House one night( pool area) and that was a great change and I was so full after I could not walk. It was very nice and well worth getting up at 7am for( you have to get up early and book it on the same day at the breakfast restaurant). My husband went back himself on his last night to the Steak House as I was too ill to go. Do book it as it is a nice change from buffet food. We did not bother with the other Speciality restaurant's as people said The Steak House was the best one. Beach The beach was a short walk down a pretty tree lined path just over the road from the hotel. We walked it each time as we got to see interesting animals and such. But you can catch a buggy back and forth if you do not want to walk it. The actual beach is beautiful with golden sand and stunning blue, green coloured sea. There are loads of sunbeds and we never had a problem at all getting them on the beach. You are using the facilities of another Riu Hotel down on the beach and I found the quality of things not quite as nice as the Riu Tequila. The drinks were not as nice at the Beach Bar, they seemed much more watered down. The food also did not seem quite as tasty. But we enjoyed the beach and it is worth going to. We found it clouded over each day just after lunch and also got very windy. One day it was quite cold down there. Time of year I guess. Gardens and Staff The Riu Tequila had beautiful gardens and they were well maintained all the time. I enjoyed walking around the gardens after eating in the evening. They were all beautifully lit up at night. The staff were always cleaning and doing things and the entire hotel was spotless. They were all friendly and spoke often and looked happy. I have never seen a hotel run so well. Everything was in order and the hotel was pristine. The entertainment staff were also very hard working and friendly and fun and did not pressure you into anything. The staff were amazing and would bend over backwards to help you. They were wonderful. My glass never stayed dry when drinking . One night I ran out of bottled water and rang reception and they bought me 2 bottles within 10 minutes. Now that is good service for you. Highlights of my trip The things that I really enjoyed on my holiday were the following. The Pina Colada's and Banana Mama's were so tasty. You have to try them. The pool bar done them nice and creamy. I enjoyed seeing the cute animals with long noses and tails around the hotel. They enjoyed my nachos too. I enjoyed how nice the staff were and how they made you feel right at home. I enjoyed the Gala nights( Christmas Eve and New Year's Eve). They were amazing. They dressed the lobby up so beautiful and had champagne and amazing buffet meals with so much choice and ice sculptures etc. It was amazing. I enjoyed walking to Playa Del Carmen for the day along the pretty tree lined street. It took about 30 minutes and was an easy walk too. Playa had plenty of shops and places to eat and the beach was really nice . Bought a few gifts here and it was totally safe and never felt threatened once. I bought a bottle of wine too on the way back to the hotel to drink in the room. It was heaven. I also enjoyed the Fat Kat boat trip which lasted around 4 hours. Music and plenty of drink and swimming while you sail along, perfect. I enjoyed chilling out on my balcony with a Pina Colada. I also felt good tipping the cleaner and luggage man and bar staff now and then as they were working so very hard and deserved it. I loved coming back to my room and finding another towel art animal. We also got a rose off our cleaner. Nice touches that make it that extra bit special. Negative things about the holiday Losing 2 days due to the weather. People getting up at 6.30-7am banging doors and waking me up to book Speciality Restaurants and to put towels on beds. The corridors were really noisy and sound seemed to carry. The wine was really awful. After several days I was craving a nice glass of wine as the hotel wine was really acidic, like vinegar. The only nice wine was the Gala champagne. I was quite ill for a few days and had to spend several days in the hotel room. Nothing to do with the hotel though at all. One day I had an awful hangover( Tequila, lol) and it was 100% my own fault. But I then caught an awful cold and felt awful for about 3 days. After feeling better for about 2 days, I then got bad diarrhoea for another 2 days and was stuck in my room. I do not think it was caused by food from the hotel as no one else mentioned having it etc. I think I may of just been low from my cold and it was just one of those things. My husband eat the same as me and was totally fine. I lost 7lbs in total in weight because during my holiday I was ill with the cold and then upset tummy and did not hardly eat or drink some days. Out of 14 days( 2 lost at Gatwick) 2 lost with tummy bug and 3 lost with bad cold) I was only well about 5 days in Mexico. So it was abit of a nightmare for me. But I am glad the Hotel was so nice and the gardens and rooms were too as I spent most of my time in them. Overview My holiday was partly spoilt by me being ill for about half the trip, but the Hotel and staff and area was really nice and I enjoyed it when I was well. Me being ill was just bad luck and nothing to do with the hotel. The hotel was amazing. It was much better than I ever imagined. Only neg things was the wine and people banging doors so early. I hope to return to this hotel again as I felt at home here and even when I was ill, it was a good place to be ill in as everyone was so helpful and friendly. I highly recommend this hotel as the service and staff and grounds are wonderful. I also found everyone in the area friendly and nonthreatening and pleasant to talk to. So go ahead and book it, you will love it. If you do like good wine, you can just buy your own from a shop in Playa, no problem.", "Date": "January 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Reading, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cBrilliant!\u201d", "Author": "craftylady031", "ReviewID": "UR91629335", "Content": "Just returned from spending Christmas at the Tequila.

Playacar is the resort - just a 15 minute confortable walk from the busy, upmarket town of Playa del Carmen, offerring an abundance of restaurants, trendy boutiques, craft stalls and value for money souvenir 'supermarkets'. The beach is a 5 minute walk from the Hotel, or a golf buggy ride away if you don't like walking, but well worth the short trek. The beach has soft white sand, loads of sun loungers, courtesy of the Rui Yucatan Hotel (in which you are allowed to use all their facilities) and there are a range of water sports available - some included in the holiday, others which are a little pricey, that are not on the all inclusive list. Sea is clear, warm and NO jelly fish, unlike Cuba! The Hotel is immaculately attended to. You'd be amazed at what they find to clean there - the attention to every detail is impressive. The rooms are very comfotable - with two double beds (nice firm matresses), good sized bathroom - no bath, only shower, which was large and always had hot water. Mini bar was re-stocked every other day and the housekeepers always did a great job of cleaning the rooms each day. Food was amazing. We've been to a few all inclusive resorts around the world and I must say Riu Tequila had the best buffet restaurant we've ever been to. There was always something different to eat each night, we didn't even bother with the al a carte restaurants as there was so much choice here. Waiters, chefs and bar staff were all extremely attentive and very friendly - especially Hilario who was our favourite breakfast waiter. Wifi in the Lobby area was fine, just a little slow when there were lots of people logging on all at the same time - but that would happen anywhere. We found that if you sit there with a rum cocktail surfing the net and checking emails, then you don't mind it taking a little longer than it would at home! The entertainment staff were very enthusiastic and very hard working. If you have kids, they will be in good hands. The evening entertainment was a bit 'kareoke' for me. Sometimes there were some professional dancers, but most of the time it was the ents staff doing a kind of 'gang show' which was somewhat tacky, but then we didn't mind too much as we could go to the shows at the Riu Yucatan and the Riu Playacar if we didn't like what was on at our Hotel! The trips are all very expensive - but this seems to be standard in the area. My advice is to go just outside the Hotel and walk a few minutes to the Plaza Playacar - a little area with shops and a couple of tourist 'booths' Some of the trips there were half the price that our Thomson Rep was asking, and they were exactly the same trip. We didn't fancy travelling for 3 hours to Chichen Itza for $99 when we know that we could get there on our own steam - there is a very decent bus depot in Playa del Carmen so you can get there for a fraction of the cost. Coba is well worth visiting as it's the only Mayan pyramid you can still walk up. I say walk up - climb up is more the word. It's a bit scarey but the view at the top is well worth it. Tulum again is very pretty, but I'd suggest you get a bus there for just 58 pesos, take your swimming gear with you and make a day of it as there is a beach right there! We didn't know whether to go to Xcaret or Xel Ha - two quite different 'eco parks'. In the end we went to both and both were well worth it - although again very expensive. The food in both parks is not a patch on the food at the hotel, but there were lots to see at Xcaret (and the show at the end was spectacular) and Xel Ha is great if you are into snorkelling and other water activities. All in all we had a wonderful two weeks in the Rui Teqila. I would definitely go back there, although I do tend to try out new places, BUT I will certainly look out for other other Riu Hotels around the world as I am impressed with their standards. This hotel was extremely good value for money. Cheaper than the hotels that were on the beach, but it really was no bother to walk to the beach when we wanted. Oh - and the Spa in the Riu Yucatan is great and good value too.

First-time experience with an all-inclusive hotel. Somewhat disappointed with hotel, but loved Playa del Carmen. Food- Hotel has 3 on-site restaurants: Main, Asian, and a Steakhouse. They also have access to a Mexican restaurant at the Riu Yucatan across the street. Last 3 require reservations for dinner. By 9 am each day ,the time we headed down for breakfast in the main restaurant, all 3 restaurants were booked solid for the1st seating at 6:45pm. The next seating at 9 pm usually had space available, but was much too late for us. We were told that the Americans and Canadians are early risers and start making their reservations in person at 7am. So, because we weren't willing to get up at the crack of dawn we were only able to try the Asian restaurant (Excellent !). All other dinners were eaten in the main restaurant. The food there was good and plentiful, but never seemed to vary. ADVICE - get up early to make your reservations if you want to eat someplace other than the main restaurant. This was our biggest disappointment with the hotel. Lunch is only served in the Steakhouse restaurant which is located by the pool area. The waiters were always friendly, helpful, and attentive. Liquor - Tasty and plentiful, but the mixed drinks seemed watered down. We watched them pour a healthy shot of rum in our drinks, but could barely taste it. Walking- The hotel is pretty spread out and a lot of walking is necessary. For example, it was about a 300 yd. walk from our room to the main reception area. If you've got arthritic knees like we do, you may wish to bring along some pain medication, or stay at a hotel with a different layout. Room- Nice, quiet, but unremarkable. \"king\" bed was really 2 double beds made-up separately and pushed together. Great housekeeping and grounds keeping staff. Beach- Big and beautiful. Golf cart-style trolley will take you from hotel entrance to beach, about 500 yds. Pool- Lovely. Made up of 2 unconnected halves. So, folks in the lower pool are unable to reach swim-up bar without having to get out of the water and walk over to upper pool. Lots of lounge chairs. Internet- Spotty service available only in the lobby area. Disappointing. Transportation- ADO runs regular bus service to PdC from Cancun's airport for $11.00 (usd) ea. way. They're located to the right of the terminal exit. Great buses. Will drop you off at central bus terminal in PdC. From there it was a $5 taxi ride to hotel. Money exchange- Nice, but not necessary. Everyone accepts usd, sometimes at 12 pesos/dollar. Scotia Bank, across from bus terminal, gave me 11.85 exchange rate. Hotel was offering only 11.15! Shopping- If you hate the crowds and aggressive salesmen in Cancun, you'll love PdC. Minimal sales pressure, little price negotiation possible, and prices are what we'd come to expect in Mexico - cheap! Brought more gifts back than we planned because the prices were so low. We would stay in Playa del Carmen again without hesitation. Next time we'll skip the all-inclusive resort so we can start discovering all the great bars and restaurants PdC has to offer.", "Date": "December 31, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kingston-upon-Hull, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cFantastic 14days over Christmas, will return without doubt\u201d", "Author": "axeandy", "ReviewID": "UR91021897", "Content": "Satrted our vacation from the UK on 14th December 2010 leaving from Birmingham.

This adds a further 1hr 30mins to your journey thats if no delays. We will cerainly fly from Gatwick next time. We ar a family of 3 , our son of 8 years loved the tequila and the very friendly staff. On arrival we were greated with a very fast check in which is excellent when you have travelled for 10hrs plus on a flight. Rooms are OK nothing special, clean tidy with twin beds, TV , SAFE, MINI BAR AND OPTICS FREE! Shower and Aircon. The facilities at the hotel are fantastic , food is perfect weather you eat at the buffet style restraunt or the steak house / mexican /asian Pool is very clean with jaccuzzi bath (not heated) As we were there over the xmas period i must praise the very hard work all the staff went to in order to make xmas a fantastic one. Nothing is too much trouble for any member of staff at this place. If they havent got it thell get it. Evening entertainment id varied , from the kids disco, games and prize giving to shows such as mama mia and moulong rouge. Bar staff are funny and very helpfull. Theres a 24hr sprts bar and a discoteque on site also. Short walk to beach or the hotels free golf cart will take you accross the road down to the beach which is very clean indeed. We took a family trip to swim with dolphines and water park called wet and wild which is well worth it. Normal price $160 dollars each but we got a deal at $109 each booked through the hut next to the towel hut within the hotel. you get arond 1hr 20mins with the dolphines in the water which is amazing and then you have the rest of the day in the water park which caters for all ages....all drinks and food is free. Met some great people on this vacation, Mark,Helenl and kids, Gareth and Rachel, Jerome , Rachel and kids. and our mates from Canada Dave, Nancy and Monique... thanks for the great laughs guys really ejoyed your company.

We read the reviews and were aware of a few negative points and were so pleased that they weren't accurate. Rooms - they are spacious and comfortable. The mini-bar is the best part and is re-stocked every two days. We lefts a note and a dollar or two on a couple of occasions and got exactly what we requested. There is bottled water in big supply for each room, with Coke, Pepsi, beers, 7up or Sprite and various other beverages. TV shows satellite tv from several countries so you can always find something half decent to watch. Balcony was fine and clean, as were the rooms themselves. Food - wow! So much choice we were finding stuff on the last day that we hadn't tried. Asian and Steak restaurants were lovely and worth trying out. The main Jalisco restaurant is for breakfast and evening meal. It is huge! More than enough choice and it changes each day anyway, with different themes. We did notice that several people (again, not naming the nationality) being so desperate to eat that they ignored the obvious queuing system which was frustrating, but it is best to let them pile up the food on their plates are just move on. Beach - how on earth can anyone criticise the beach?!?! We noticed certain nationalities moaned about the walk to the beach, which was a huge surprise to us. It is around 5 to 7 minutes walk if you walk at a normal, steady pace, plus there is a golf cart to give you a lift if you need it. How can anybody moan about the distance from hotel to the beach?? If you can't walk this short distance once or twice a day then their laziness should just be ignored. The beach itself is heavenly. Clear blue sea and more than enough sunbeds for everyone. We read someone moan about the distance from the waves to the beds/shade!! Some people are never happy and just love to moan about something. The sand is cool, doesn't burn your feet, and the hotel bar is nearby so you can get food or drink anytime. Hotel - in general is immaculate and lovely. The staff are amazing and so friendly. The bar staff even better and so lively. It is almost impossible to find a fault. Overall I would urge everyone to ignore the bad reviews because if you look closely the faults are either down to their laziness or their rediculously picky expectations (such as people moaning about no room service - surely they can get up off the bed/bum for 2 minutes and stroll to the restaurant like every other normal person!). Also, if you read any brochure or website you will realise the resort isn't beach-side. However, this is actually better because the beach-side RIU that is over the road has hundreds of people passing by all day, using their facilities etc, whereas the Tequila is a lot more peaceful and you get less traffic from people passing by.", "Date": "December 29, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGood value resort but I am not happy with the beach\u201d", "Author": "ToRiuBambu", "ReviewID": "UR90747555", "Content": "Just came back from Riu Tequila. This was first time when my family bought flight, transportation and hotel separately. Usually we buy packages to fly out of Toronto, but this time we bought flight tickets out of Detroit. We saved this about 45% and we were very happy with our choice. Spirit airlines charge for everything, but it was good flight, everything on time and most importantly - cheap. We did transportation from airport and back with USA Transfers and it was all good. We requested quiet room and we did get room 190x that was at the very end of the resort. So there was not much \"pass through\" traffic through our building, so it was definitely quieter than other buildings. Keep in mind that rooms have thin walls and you can hear other people. But I always slept with my earplugs :-). Entertainment - it was probably one of the best nightly entertainments - good quality shows. I especially enjoyed Mexico night dances. Food - was OK, as expected but was not great. We ate breakfast and dinner at our hotel and lunch at Riu Yucatan as we always went to the beach. At Riu Yucatan restaurant by the beach had very poor selection of food - I was able to eat there just pizza, salada and fruits. But at Riu Yucatan main restaurant food was better. Service was OK, few nights at dinner we had very bad service, but to be honest we don't care much about these things. Biggest disappointment - beach. Yes, after reading all these reviews I was expecting good beach. But RIU BEACH HAS 2 BIG PROBLEMS: - There is about 30feet (10meters) area at the beach from where water starts where you cannot place you beach chairs! That was THE BIGGEST DISAPPOINTMENT to us. We want to stay on the edge of the ocean and hear waves - staying 30feet away it is not good enough! - Shade on the beach is far away from water. You have to sit at least 60feet (20m) away from water to find some shade. If you want to be in the shade all the time, you have to go further. If hotel would fix these 2 above problems, this resort would become our favorite destination. We noticed that other resort on the right was letting place chairs right up to the water edge and they provided umbrellas! I believe resort was Iberostar \"something\", so we will try to book our vacation next time there. Hotel is not at the beach, but it took us 6min 30sec to walk from our hotel lobby to the beach area, or shuttle took 2min 30sec. If you don't care about beach issues I reported above, then this is very good hotel and represents very good value.

The Good and Bad about this hotel.\u201d", "Author": "cullencanada", "ReviewID": "UR90657591", "Content": "Just to give a background we are Canadian and in our mid/late 20's. We checked in on December 18th and was a little early so the front desk gave us our bracelets and towel cards to enjoy the food,alcohol and ammenities. They are very nice at the front desk. The highlights of our trip from the resort were the staff especially the bar and restaurant staff. At night please check out the main bar next to reception as it gets pretty good. Look for Arsenio and order some Tequila slammers. He really enjoys his job and he even saw us leaving and wished us a Merry Christmas. Also look out for Felix at the steakhouse, best waiter I have ever had. In general everything was great, people were very friendly and the food was really good. My girlfriend is very picky and she loved it. The maid service was excellent. Very clean rooms. I tipped 30 pesos every day for them, they do a great job. I will just get to the bad and what can be improved because let's be honest, that is what people are looking for. 1. The beds are rock hard. My gf hurt her neck sleeping on the matresses. Pillows were comfortable. 2. TV's are old and outdated but I didn't care because I came for the beach. But it would have been nice to watch a bit early in the morning but my tv was busted a bit. 3. The alcohol bottles they give you aren't the best. They give you 4 liquor bottles with 3 being very cheap versions and the 4th was a watered down bottle of Jose Cuervo. I guess they want to save a bit of money by watering it down. I called to change one of the bottles to Whiskey and they told me it was gonna be $40 extra. Thought I was at an all-inclusive resort? 4. No room service, only at the Riu Palace I was told. 5. The resort is across the street from the beach so it's a 10 minute walk to the beach. Really the only thing I didn't like because it was kind of far. They have a golf cart that will drive u over from 730am-1pm and then 3pm-6pm. I guess the guy has his lunch between that time because it's kind of odd hours to not have this service. Anyhow, this is the worst part of the hotel because it's a far walk from our room. 6. Entertainment is brutal. I actually saw people in shock from how bad it was. Not going to go in big detail because we were pre drinking before we went out so it wasn't a huge deal to us. But the one guy who is in the show is everywhere, even on the beach doing volleyball, soccer,horseshoes,yoga,etc.. very good. They need a better entertainment director, period. 7. The pool isn't near the beach, so we used the Riu Yucatan the entire time. Not a big deal because you can use any Riu except the Palace. 8. We did the Snorkeling tour which is $35 per person, great time. One problem.. When they pick u up your the 2nd group of people on the boat next to the crowd from the Riu Palace and when they drop you off they go to part of the beach from the Riu Palace and make you walk back to the office near Yucatan with all your gear. 9. Lot of kids which I understand being a resort. Should have went all adult. Well sorry for all the negatives but we had a great time because we always try to make the best out of everything. Would I go to this hotel again? Probably not. However, it's only because there were a lot of kids running around yelling and going crazy during the day. Far from the beach and would have liked something right on the beach. I would consider the Riu Palace which I wanted from the get go but was full on 2 of the days I wanted to book. Seems as though the Riu caters to this place and they get every perk there is. I honestly would probably look elsewhere and try something new. Playa del Carmen is beautiful and the beach is amazing.

Good hOliday overall. Top 5 good things: 1. Instead of being bored of one resort you get to mix it up a bit by using other RIu resorts in area 2. Good food and drinks. Variety\u00a0 makes it interesting.\u00a0 3. More resort like than hotel than other RIUs across street. Plus since across street from beach it is quieter. Best of both worlds.\u00a0 4. Clean rooms. Comfy beds. No complaints.\u00a0 5. No pushy sales or staff or begging for tips.\u00a0 Worst 5 things: 1. Lots of smokers and no non smoking rooms or areas on the resort. (usually europeans) With young kids it was frustrating having to go from table to table or find clean air in lObby or poolside. Mgt please make smoke free area on beach, pool and lobby.\u00a0 3. Not alot, but Some loud and\u00a0 obnoxious guests (usually\u00a0 Americans) 4. Crowded beach! Lots of people from 10 resorts sharing 1km beach. We are used to more sparse beach so this was more than we arabicas to.\u00a0 5. Tour reps selling expensive packages. \u00a0Some were tourist traps. Some tour reps sold the same package cheaper so shop around.\u00a0 Tips: 1. Guests can use other RIU resorts except palaces. BUT we can use palace jacuzzi and sauna.\u00a0 2. For quiet beach area walk south 3 hotels to empty beach area.\u00a0 3. Tequila poolside volleyball court has cement bottom and little sand and no warning signs. Don't dive for volleyball or you will break a rib! 4. There is non smoking seating in front for the nightly shows. If you have kids ask if show is suitable for kids. Warning: Some shows girls wear next to nothing and male dancers humping them. Our family left asap.\u00a0 5. Tequila is best resort for families since across street and only way out is front gate with guard.

The hotel has everything to offer and has plenty going on during the day and night with a lively atmosphere. The rooms and complex were all spotless and had plenty of facilities throughout. Although other hotels facilities are available we did not feel the need to use them as we had everything at the Tequila and wtih a good entertainment team and nightclub found many other people visiting the hotel every night. The Staff are absolutely fantastic, very friendly and will do anything for you making you feel very at home. The Tequila entertainment staff or \"animation team\" are excellent who do a very good job everyday and night again making you feel very welcome.

We booked with Thomsons, and everything was fine; no delays and a smooth transfer from the airport to the hotel. Once on the coach to the hotel we were each given a bottle of free water. Upon arrival at the hotel we were given a cocktail while we queued for our wristbands to be put on and were then given an envelope with room key, pool towel cards and hotel information. The head of reception then pointed us all in the direction of our room. The room was what we expected and we were lucky to be away from the main reception/bar area which was nice because we did not hear any noise and had nice greenery around our block. The reception area and bars completely open and the reception area has free wifi. This is very handy and this area was particularly busy in the mornings. If you have an Iphone or similar device, make sure you download and then add some credit to Skype so you can call home for next to nothing. We could not fault anything about the hotel, staff, or food. All staff here work very hard 24/7. We had a slight problem in our room, during the first couple of days of our stay however this was sorted immediately, and upon return to our room a bottle of cava was awaiting us with a note from the management. Staying at the Tequila, you can use all the other RIU hotels facilities in the resort (apart from the Palace's). There were plenty of sports and activities going on at all the hotels. During the day we spent most of the time at the Playacar hotel as unfortunately at the Tequila pool only one side of the pool gets the sun all day and the other is in the shade come lunchtime. Playacar seemed to have it all day. We then had lunch and drinks at the Playacar hotel. The beach is lovely also, nice clean sand (the staff sweep the seaweed up) and plenty of sunbeds whatever time you went. If you are going to the beach you can either walk or get a golf buggy from the hotel. Seeing as the walk is only about 5 minutes down a shaded pathway, the buggy seemed a little unnecessary. Meals at the Tequila were very nice and it was only towards the end of the two weeks we started to notice the meals being repeated. Main restaurant for breakfast and dinner, was enjoyable, with a Full American breakfast buffet (with a fresh omelet, pancake, egg), continental, fruit section etc in the mornings and on the spot cooking stations and a variety of food in the evenings (freshly cooked pasta, \u201cMexican\u201d corner and International). We ate at all 3 of the \u00e0 la carte restaurants, these being Mexican cuisine (\u00e0 la carte; buffet starters and dessert), Asian cuisine (all buffet) and Grill and steakhouse (\u00e0 la carte). I think the steakhouse was our favorite; however, everyone sits down to eat at the same time (two sittings), and you are pretty much served all at the same time - all starters sitting under the hot plate until everyone is ready - hence they can get cold while you are waiting. Snacks are available 24 hours a day - either at the restaurants or in the Sports Bar. There is a fridge in the Sport bar that has hot dogs, hamburgers, pizza, sandwiches, fruit in and microwaves beside the fridge for you to heat it up in. Unlimited local and imported beverages served 24 hours a day - just make sure you say the named brand when ordering your drinks (Smirnoff Vodka, Havana / Bacardi Rum, Gordons Gin etc.) We regularly went to the main Playa del Carmen town (5th Avenue) and this can be reached by walking along the beach, road or taxi. If walking it takes about 20-25minutes and a taxi, 5 minutes, only costing 50 pesos (\u00a32.50). Here there are lots of bars, shops and Walmart (aka Asda - yes, they even sell George clothing!). The Tequila Barrel is a great sports bar with a wide range of Mexican beers, tequila and excellent buffalo wigs. We only did one trip during our stay to Xcaret, and we booked this direct through the internet as we saved 10%. Cheaper than Thomson; and whoever you book it with transport is not included however, a taxi only costs 140 pesos. At Xcaret, an ecological fresh water park, we also swam with the dolphins, which we can highly recommend. Upon departure from Mexico you have to pay departure tax of 640 pesos. The equivalent can be paid in dollars or pounds I'd recommend this hotel and area to friends, family and would return.", "Date": "December 16, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oswaldtwistle", "Title": "\u201cFantastic will return.\u201d", "Author": "jimbaron50", "ReviewID": "UR89998947", "Content": "My wife and i have just returned from the most fantastic holiday we have ever had, and we have had some.

Pro's: The management of this hotel were probably some of the most visible I have ever seen at any hotel, even working the door on the restaurant or on reception at times. They were always friendly and we always felt they were trying hard. Ruby in the Pool bar, and Patricia in the main lobby bar were superb, always friendly, and Ruby especially always provided much entertainment!! The pool areas of this hotel are some of the nicest we have seen in our travels. Landscaped very well, and we only struggled to find sunbeds on one day in our whole two weeks, Most mornings you could wander down right up until mid morning and find a good spot in the sun. The Rooms and public areas of this hotel are lovely. We stayed in the Riu Yucatan last year for two weeks and it we very obvious that this has been refurbished more recently from the style used (just walk down to the Riu Playacar which has yet to be refurbished and you will se what I mean!). Even So Riu do have a particular style they like which involves dark woods and old spanish colonial styles, if this is not your tastes then you wont like this hotel and id suggest you go elsewhere, though you'd have to be pretty easily swayed to find it unpleasant! The reception area has free wifi! The food was always hot, tasty and was always a very good quality. I am very fussy when it comes to meat,but always found something and tried a lot of new things which was a first for me. We also had a vegatarian in our group who ate very well compared to the Yucatan last year. Special credit goes to Sabrina the Assistant manager who came and assisted one of our party who had a query about the pasta, and wanted to know if it was egg pasta or wheat pasta they used due to an allergy to eggs. She quizzed the chefs until she got the answer we needed (Mostly Wheat pasta's), and was professsional and friendly and really impressed. The only weaknesss to the food we found was that the rotation they used was very limited and you found that any one night could be repeated upto 3/4 times in a two week period which meant you did get bored. One big thing I liked about this hotel was the fact the pool bar actually had a no smoking section to it, so you could have your lunch by the pool without a big side order of smoke, though if you goto the beach and have your lunch there, take it to your sunbed as theres no such area in the beach restaurants, and no such manners shown by the smokers to the non smokers trying to eat a meal. Cons: The area as nice as it is, is badly designed. One side gets the sun all day and the other is in the shade all day. If you are a true sunworshipper goto the beach you'll find it easier to stay in the sun. The type of guest this hotel seems to attract quite frankly was what I can only describe as Chav. They liked to sit around all day drinking all day and then paid very little respect to the people trying to sleep on a night, laughing, shouting and joking while walking past your room on a night at most times of the night. We noticed the english more doing this, but I think this was more down to the fact that the English outnumber everyone else at this hotel, as other nationalitys did not seem better. Had to use earplugs to sleep every night which I did not appreciate over the course of two weeks. This is to be honest the only big con I can give to this hotel. That maybe only one big con to the hotel, but I can say It is a big enough thing, that will ensure we never make a repeat visit to this hotel. We probably would not even recomend it to friends as we do not think they would like it for the same reason. It was a shame cause it was a beautiful hotel, well run with nice food and excellent service. The decoration of the room for one of our parties 30th Birthday was very much appreciated and well done (again signed off by Sabrina) and we always felt that this hotel wanted us to enjoy our stay. Unfortunately we are not the sort of people who like to sit by a pool alll day drinking and getting drunk. We were all light sleepers who hated being woken by the inconsiderate guests on our floor and walking past our rooms who seemed to be out to enjoy their holiday with the attitude of screw what anyone else wants for their stay. If your a heavy sleeper, and not as observant of the people around you as us, you will hopefully appreciate this hotel and have a fantastic stay. We wont return though as we appreciate the niceties like nice manners and people who consider people trying to do things like sleep during the night, which is a shame as it had all the key recipes of a fantastic holiday and was let down by that one big thing. Riu you did everything right by us, thank you. I am aware that this review looks a little snotty, but I would say if you are someone that thinks that nice manners and being considerate of other guest is a basic must of your holiday you may want to consider one of the palace hotels or even the yucatan.

Here are a few of our views: The people at the hotel are great, they are friendly and always there if you need help. I can't praise these ladies and gentlemen enough. Alberto one of the guys on reception is a star- he is friendly and very helpfull with any questions about trips, buses, local area etc. The facilities are also very good, the two pools are clean and maintained during the day, lovely pool bar (the more you tip the waiters, the stronger the drinks) . The rooms are large and very clean, two three quarter beds pushed together- lots of space to spread out if its hot but not ideal for couples. Electronic safe, balcony and loads of storage, their is a tv, but only a few english speaking channels. The mini bar is great, stocked daily with your choice of drinks, the optics are a novelty, but non branded local strong alcohol. The only bad point is that we felt the air con was not great ( but it was really hot). The hotel is situated in the most fantastic grounds well worth a walk around, especially the wild life lizards, racoon type animlas etc. From us the main low point was the food, it wasn't bad by any means and if your used to fully inclusive you will probally love it. For us (our first time at an all inclusive) We couldn't get use to the speed of a self service meal, (a three course meal in 15 mins ! must be a record !) We also didn't like the repetition of eating the same place every night usually favouring to explore and try a few places in the evenings, but that defeats the object of all inclusive. Breakfast is the best meal of the day, with a great choice! We tried the steakhouse but it has a set menu, the buffet is the best idea a vast choice although be sometimes quantity over quality is not a good thing ! We travelled with Thompsons, great flights and a quick transfer. We booked two trips: Chichen Itza- A great day out we had a guide called Willie a fantastic mayan guide, he knew everything and was entertaining. All in all a great day out, but be prepared it's a long day, 3 hours on the bus, but worth it. We also visited Xei Ha- An ecological fresh water water park it cost \u00a365 each with animal encounters extra. The only reason we went was to swim with the Manatees, we arrived at the park and tried to book a time and got informed they were already fully booked! We didn't realise you can book online, so despite being first in the park everything could be fully booked already, very disappointing as this was the only real reason we were going ! However the snorkeling is fantasic natural spring with loads of great sights and enormous fish. 5th avenue (Taxi 500 Pesos. only about \u00a32.50)- what a great night out, loads of bars busy, shops selling cheap souvenirs and everything you could want ! The Tequila Barrel is a great sports bar. We only visted one restaurant call 'Sur' for my birthday, what a restaurant the guys working there are the best ! I had lobster which melted in your mouth. Fairly expensive but great for a special night out.There are lots of shops with guys outside but we all have too make a living ! Just say no thank you and thats the end of the story, they will leave you alone. Just a quick overall view: A great holiday the hotel and people are just out of this world.

Hotel itself is nice. Location is really good and it really doesn't matter that its not beach front, as the shuttle is really frequent. Buffet food is ok, although a bit repetitive after a while and as with all buffets, you soon get fed up of walking round plate in hand for most of the meal time. The steakhouse restaurant with waiter service was good. Was a bit dissapointed to find that the Asian restaurant was another buffet, although on a smaller scale. The beach is fabulous..a couple of rougher days with some big waves but in all it was totally gorgeous. Playacar itself is a little purpose built complex of a handful if hotels and condos (4 Riu's and a couple of others) It is very safe to walk around, as is 5th avenue. Best trip we did was XCARET. It does seem expensive, but it's well worth it. There is so much to do, that we bought the 2 day ticket and easily filled in 2 whole days...lots there for a toddler, animals, aquarium, dolphins, turtles...loads loads more. We didn't book this through a tour, just got a taxi ourself (rates are set prices so there's no haggling to be done). Bedrooms in the Tequila need a bit of updating. Bedding and decor looks a bit tired. The bathroom is seperated by a curtain from the main living area. The bed is two doubles pushed together and in our case, one higher than the other!

Absolutely amazing. The pool bar was where the majority of the english hung out, the bar staff were second to none, Arsenal, Rossi (Rosy), Cruz, Ana and the others were fab, full of fun.

The only bad thing was the mexican restaraunt attached to the Riu Yucatan (Not a part of the Riu Tequila at all) otherwise known as the beach bar, we ordered a beef fajita and a chicken fajita, but they brought us a prawn and a chicken, after explaining the mistake off the waiter went and brought back our order, so far so good, as I tucked into my meal, the beef one, it tasted funny so I asked my hubby to taste it, he picked out a piece of beef and underneath was a king prawn and about five scattered on the plate, now I have a slight allergy to prawns so I found this quite upsetting, we complained to the waiter who offered to change it but by then I had eaten some of the beef laden with fish juice so I didn't feel comfy finishing the meal.

The beds seemed a tad damp, maybe a combination of air con and humidity. The drinks in the room fridge were replenished as and when, we found the in room optics unneccessary, we were only 100 yards from the pool bar!! The bar drinks were fine, apart from the now infamous wine! the beer is drinkable, it's Dos Equis, not Corona as I thought, the Cerveza Negra (Dark Beer) is not bad. All the staff are cheerful and welcoming. The animacion team were fantastic, working hard to get people involved in various games during the day, although not too hard or pushy. My youngest used the kids club (Riu Land) every day and was involved in various productions, 'Grease', 'The Lion King' which he loved. Again, ALL the staff here were fantastic, in direct contrast to the Thomson rep, Suzy, who was a complete waste of space, unsympathetic, unhelpful and downright rude, I think she needs to reassess her choice of career.

I may think again before travelling with Thomson and upgrading to Premium. Fast checkin service, with your bags brought to your room.

Unsure if that was due to the Boots 50% DEET spray or the fact that it was one of the coldest Oct/Nov the locals had seen in years. Only got to around 25c and was cloudy - mainly due to Hurrican Tomas. Food was good and varied, the bar in your room is OK, but not the real deal with the bottled vodka ect. The service in the bars and resturants was excellent. Your glass didnt get empty before a fresh tipple appeared. The pool was both clean and well appointed. The Coatimundis are very naughty and will get into your bags and glass wear if they can. They roam in packs and can be quite cute until you have food and then they swarm all over you lol. The beach is fine sands and is very clean, just a few minutes walk or ride in the golf cart. Well worth a visit but little things make it miss the five star element. No tea/coffee facilities in the room, noisy hallways, loud/drunk american young people, smoking aloud in most areas of the hotel, not dressing for dinner and the hit and miss entertainment all take the edge off a 5 star.

In the morning all became clear. We requested a room with a balcony, bath & shower. Instead we were given a room with a shower and we were on the ground floor with a terrace which meant you couldn't really sit out of an evening without every looking in at you. Also we are nearing 60 and our room was right opposite the childrens playground! We went to reception + they changed our room for us no question. Unfortunatley the room we were given was so dark & gloomy. Dark wood furniture, yellow walls, brown bed covers & orange & brown curtains. Horrible! You also had a brown & orange curtain seperating the bedroom from the shower room. Still no bath, they said all rooms are the same. These really need updating. The food wasn't that good, same old buffet food each night, then reheated the next day. Steak house was awful too, make sure you have a toothpick with you, the meat is really tough! The Asian restaurant wasn't any better. Needless to say I was ill in bad one day with stomach cramps. The staff were really friendly & helpful. The entertainment crew tried so hard, one night was especially good I hadn't laughed so much for ages. They really are a credit to the hotel. I think that is why people return to this hotel. We didn't stay around the pool area, we opted to go to the beach each day. You can either walk (5mins) or take the little beach buggy. The beach was clean the water was nice & warm. You could have your lunch there at the Beach club, the food was exactly the same tho. We left the hotel & arrived at the airport only to be turned away after 8 hrs, our flight had been cancelled. Thomsons put us up in the Riu Cancun which believe it or not was worse than the Tequila. Thomsons need to get their act together and sort these hotels out.

The good first, it was built 12 years ago and from the moment we stepped off the coach the staff clicked into action, no long queues at reception as every group had an envelop waiting for them on the table along with the duty manager giving brief instructions on how to check in and we were in our room within 10mins with cases following in another 10. The room was a good size, clean with everything that you could need including minibar and 4 spirt optics (very novel!!) which was re-stocked every day. The food was a good standard and i would challenge anyone to not find something that they liked, the waiters were very attentive and as soon as your plate or glass was empty it was either taken away or re-filled. The entertainment staff work tirelessly to ensure that everyone can take part if they want too and nothing is too much trouble, the beach is 10mins walk or if you really want to be lazy the golf cart transports you in 3mins!! We went with Thompson and although had read reviews about the trips booked anyway to go to Coba Mayan village & Fatcat Catamaran, wished we had taken the advise of other travellers, Coba was a 10hr day mostly on & off the coach when really it could have been done in 3hrs (either take a taxi or go down to the Plaza - 3mins walk and book through them), Fatcat was disapointing as they failed to pick us up, Suzy the rep was great, refunded the cost without hassle. Now the not so good, the hotel is 12 years old and is now starting to look a bit worse for wear and could do with some freshening up. The outside chairs were plastic which you can get down at B&Q for \u00a35, not 5*!! As non smokers the reception area at times was like a blue smog with no desigated smoking area just a free for all which was very offputting. The dress code in the restaurants was very relaxed with footbal shirts allowed in the dining room and no shirts or shoes allowed in the pool restaurant , again not really 5* but the most disappointing aspect was the speciality Asian & Steakhouse. You can book very easliy however the experience was disappointing with the Asian (no different than eating in a chinese buffet at home only the food at home with the food much better!!), the steakhouse is better (go for the rib eye) but still mass prepared and not cooked to order.

We liked the flexibility of being able to use the other Riu hotel facilities and much prefered the pool area of Riu Yucatan to the Tequila mainly due to the bad language and behaviour of some of the guests staying at Tequila. Please guys, have fun but do you really need to use foul language close to young kids and be so aggressive in the pool with the games? Also, while moaning ( and this is again not at the hotel but the guests), we found that certain kids were left to their own devices most evenings and parents tended to use the entertainment staff as baby-sitters. This might be ok if your kids are well behaved, but unacceptable if not! We had to fantastic trips, one to Xel-hal the other to Chichen Itza both excellant but costly.

Mexico is a great place and I enjoyed the whole holiday immensley. Despite my initial reservations at staying in a 'gated community' I really was pleasantly surprised by the Playacar area. It wasn't really comfortable walking distance to 5th Ave shopping area in that sort of heat, but the cab's are quick and cheap and safe to transport you to and fro. The Hotel itself is beautiful, you really do feel like you're in your own little tropical paradise, the sound of the birds and the other strange little four-legged friends was wonderful and the well maintained exotic gardens were a real surprise. I'd seen pictures but it doesn't do real justice. I'm glad we chose this hotel set just a few minutes back from the beach, it was a nice little tree-lined stroll away or the golfbuggy was regular enough if you were too lazy to walk. What can I say about the beach? STUNNING! I hate sand and generally avoid beaches when I go away but I was convinced to try it and my GOD am I glad I did, beautiful soft sand and the warmest crystal clear turquoise water, I'm hooked! We spent every spare moment there when we weren't off on trips. I wouldn't sit by the pool at all after that water! The trips we went on were superb, Chichen Itza was a must do for me and it didn't disappoint, our guide Rex was a fountain of knowledge and his passion for the place was infectious, the sellers were a little annoying but you get used to ignoring them after a while and they aren't offended in any way. We did the dolphin trainer for life at dolphin discovery and again it was a brilliant experience, these excursions were pricey but absolutely worth every penny and more, I had the most amazing day and would recommend it to anyone and everyone! The Mexican people all seem genuinely happy and were all so nice, the hotel staff in particular from bellboys to waiters, barstaff and reception were all polite at all times and everyone has the time-of-day for you, nothing is too much and they all want to help. Some hotels seem a little false but these people have a great manner about them and made our stay very pleasant. The all-inclusive package with Thomson was the best I've ever had as it literally seemed to include everything all day long, some can be a little restricted but not here. If you are thinking of booking this hotel then my recommendation would be YES YES YES!", "Date": "October 10, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "newcastle", "Title": "\u201cHoneymoon a bit of a disappointment!\u201d", "Author": "chem_teacher10", "ReviewID": "UR82654499", "Content": "We travelled to the Riu Tequila for our honeymoon. We were kind of disappointed with it as a honeymoon but the place itself is lovely. Having gone to Thompsons and spoken to one of the travel agents we were recommended to book here for our honeymoon. We had originally wanted to book the Riu Palace (the big 5* hotel just down the road) but were put off by the girl in the shop who had just returned from the tequila. In hinesight we wish we had gone with our gut instinct. The flight out to mexico was awful. A real faff on. We were aware that we would have to travel via manchester but we were reassured that the stop off would only be about half an hour. This in fact was (especially a romantic honeymoon). This was later explained to us because the flight was late out of Newcastle we then had to circle at Manchester which made us miss our slot and then to top matters off there was a tug plane that was stuck in front of us on the runway in Manchester. The plane itself was very tatty and not particularly clean. The service on bored was OK at max. The crew were not really interested and we were only served drinks once on a 12 hour flight. My husband who is not a particularly great flier was very frustrated by this. We decided not to pay the extra money for the premier upgrade. Which we were pleased as when we disembarked we walked through first class and the seats were virtually identical.The only difference being is that you got access to a 'stop' and 'rewind' button for your tv. This itself would have been very useful as the stupid thing wa son a loop. Thompson - How on earth are people able to guess when films start? WE ARE NOT MIND READERS! When we eventually arrived in Mexico the disembarkment was swift and well organised. The bus transfer was fab and the driver very friendly and informative. The buses were clearly marked and this was extremely well managed. When we eventually arrived at the hotel we were very impressed with the initial check in - We were given an envelope with keys and paper work in and then sent off to our room. This wasnt so clear as we were sent off by our selves to find our block. The grounds of the hotel are beautiful with lushous and green vegetation all around you. The blocks were pretty and bright and well spread out in order to minimise noise. When we eventually found our room it was clean and spacious but it did smell very damp. I suppose we got used to it but not really the best smell to arrive to. The room itself was well appointed. The storage space and general decoration was ok. Again not really 5* but nothing to really whinge about. The balcony was pleasant and ours looked into the woods. This was really good for feeding the little animals that roamed the grounds. The bathroom was clean and functional. The shower really does need some kind of lighting in it as its not the best having to shower with the curtain open. The 'bar' was ridiculous. The optics being literally full of PAINT STRIPPER! be warned do not drink this stuff. We tried it and dropped some on the varnished wood and by the next day the varnish had come off. Just imagine what it is doing to your insides! The full fridge was fantastic however and made up for the fact there was no room service available. We took drinks to the beach and was fab on trips in order to save a bit of cash! The hotel itself was lovely - RIU staff brilliant - nothing to much of a hassle to help you with. The bar tenders were fabulous. Mkaing you anything you wanted. Shame I cant really say the same about the Thompson staff who generally didnt really seem bothered with us. Not very helpful and I hate to say on some occasions rude! The trips were what made this holiday. Xel Ha, Coba, Tulum and Deplhinium were AMAZING! best spent money on the whole of the two weeks. Jesus the tour guide at Coba deserves a big thank you and he was fabulous. We spent two weeks here and tried all 3 speciality restaurants. The best being the steakhouse. Neither the asian or mexican were very good. We did however find a lovely local restaurant in Playa del Carmen. We ventured out a few times at night as the enetertainment was not really our cup of tea. Bit much we felt! The reception is NOT air conditioned and mosquitos are rife. We plastered ourselves constantly in deet but still managed to get bitten to shreds. Not the fault of Riu or Thompson we know but it is wort mentioning. Flight back even worse than one over. The flight attendants even slagging off another passenger beside us refering to her as the 'fat blonde woman at the front' Not really a good advert for Thompson! The food on this flight was not good compared to the way out and they had no lager or diet coke left on board. RIDICULOUS really - supposedly they sold out on way over. Overall we had a good time, the resort was beautiful with FAB Riu staff but Thompson on the whole let themselves down. However I would say this is NOT a honeymoon venue.

Firstly the location of the Hotel is not good requiring a taxi journey in and out of playa del carmen (unless you are young and fit). The beach is quite good but little shade as the trees have only been replanted this year. The grounds of the hotel are quite nice as you are more or less living in the jungle but this makes most rooms dark even during the day. Rooms are dull and plain, certainly not luxury and the optics are cheap local spirits and beer. There is no tea or coffee in rooms (5 star)? There is no waiter service anywhere in the hotel for drinks except buffet restaurant (5 star)? And if you think you are drinking Smirnoff in the bars think again, bottles are refilled with cheap crap. Food is plain and repetitive and mostly look warm. want to go to eat in T shirt and flip flops, no problem COME ON DOWN! day or night. The restaurants which you can book are early and late sittings, went to the Asian once, cold food, rice like a golf ball, steakhouse a lot better but starter is one onion ring, one deep fried mushroom, one baby rib, one deep fried broccoli, hello is this 5 star. Red, rose' and red wine like petrol but good fun watching new arrivals drinking it for the first time. Sports bar it definately is, basketball with the burgers or pole vault with the hot dogs lol. The resort has an excellent swimming pool and the staff work very hard to make your stay good. If you like Brits abroad, football shirts,towels on sunbeds from 7am, tequila boom booms and pile your plate high with burgers pizza and hotdogs for starters then I would thoroughly recommend this hotel.

We normally go to Florida every year, so are used to a certain level of service on holiday, however, our budget was lower this year so we looked elsewhere from Florida for our holiday, which lead us to Mexico! I was very apprehensive about this, but all I can say is, there was absolutley no need for my worries! When we arrived at the hotel, check-in was the best I have ever experienced! We were given a cute little cocktail, and an envelope containing all our papers and room keys, and told to return the forms that needed to be filled out to reception that evening. The rooms were amazing, having never been all inclusive before, we were so surprised with all that was included for us. The room was s spacious and I really thought it looked very 'Mexican', which I just loved! The air-con was very cold, but the weather was so warm we had to keep the ceiling fan on constantly too! Our maid, her name was Nancy,was just great!! She kept the room spotlessly clean, she was so cute, always buzzing around out little room block. She made us so many cute towel animals too, I think little touches like that made the hotel so good! Didn't spend much time by the pool, i as nice, but we preferred the beach, which was so beautiful! There was always a choice of places to sit, and the sea was so blue! There was a nice lunch buffet/drinks place just on the beach, so we didnt have to trapise back to the hotel to get a drink, which was fantastic! The food in the hotel wasnt the best i've ever eaten, but i am so fussy, my fiance loved it and never felt hungry as there was always something for him! We loved the ice cream and the breakfasts were so yummy!!! There were so many activities to do in the resort itself, water parks, day trips! Our faves were swimming with the Whale Sharks and Manatees!

Hotel - Fab, large and very clean rooms, comfy beds, brill air conditioning and optics and mini bar which you can use at no extra charge and will be refilled everyday!! Food - Delicious and well varied. Loved the buffet, steakhouse and mexican. Not so keen on the chinese (starters not bad, but main meal a bit bland). Drink - Amazing cocktails, huge selection of well known branded spirits. Only downside was the wine! Not great! But not the end of the world as plenty of other drinks to choose from. Staff - Possibly the most friendly and happy people we have ever met!! They seem to get pleasure from working!! They constantly run around after the guests and totally love doing it!! Beach - Only a short distance away and if you dont fancy the walk, you can get a lift on the hotel golf buggy. My partner was just recovering from a broken ankle and didnt mind the walk or the buggy! So dont be put off. Once at the beach, you wont be dissappointed. The most beautiful and clean beaches you'll ever see. Pools - Lovely and clean, large and great having a swim up bar. We are more beachy people though. Things to do - To much, there is a lot of history and cultural things to do, but also fun active excursions. So much we struggled to fit everything in ( a good excuse to go back). Playacar is a small place which is nice, if you want more you can pay \u00a32.50 for a taxi to Playa Del Carmen or \u00a325 for a taxi to Cancun. Lots of options for daytime or nighttime activities. Overall a great great holiday. Whether you want a quiet or busy holiday you can be confident with the Hotel Tequila. If you want to push the boat out and go for slightly higher standard, I would recommend the Riu Palace Playcar, which is over the road. I would say good enough for a luxury wedding.

Overall this would appear to be similiar to a Butlins ( however we have not done a Butlins!!! - but is how we imagine this is ). One good point - the bar staff work very hard and we were impressed by these guys. In the evening the bar/theatre area turned into what appeared to be a 'Working Mens Club' - some guests just have no idea how to behave - hence 2* The pool area was good however many beds were in the background - not enough space to sit really near the pool. Also there we many arguments over the Golf caddy going to the beach as this only hold 7 people and a few tried to jump the queue - really its just a quick to walk. Also wild life very visible but not a problem except for the snakes and these did become a problem - however the staff dealt with them efficiently. Overall this is RIU at possibly it's worst that we have visisted and feel that this hotel should be downgraded to a min 3* Anyway - would not return and will give the RIu's a miss for a while as the standards have clearly slipped.", "Date": "September 17, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "bournemouth", "Title": "\u201cWonderful!\u201d", "Author": "iloveholidays44", "ReviewID": "UR79212678", "Content": "We have been to the Riu Tequila several times - the last time in 2009. We have just booked it again for Jan 2011 and really missed going this year!! We are well travelled and would consider this one of the most rewarding hotels and areas we have stayed in. We have stayed in \"all singing and all dancing 5 star\" hotels but they have never managed to have the ambience, warm and friendly service or overall feel of the tequila. The food choice is excellent and you can have lunch at one of the sister hotels down at the beach. The gardens around the blocks of rooms give a lovely tropical surrounding and the shy little animas that I think are agoutis in the grounds are really sweet. A bit naughtier but very funny are the coatimundi that you can sometimes see on the jungle side of the hotel particularly early morning and dusk. You can find quiet places just to read and chill out of join in the fun with the lively animation team (they are very good at recognising when you're just wanting to chill out) There are two pools and one tends to be a bit noisier with organised water games etc but the other is ideal for relaxing. The pools are kept clean every day and if you fancy a dip in the sea there's a little golf buggy that takes you down to the beach (doesn't run in siesta hours 1pm-3pm I think) but it's a lovely short walk if you need to get a bit of excercise after breakfast! A big plus is the staff. They are lovely and I have found it very sad that people can occasionally be very rudely demanding when they are such nice people who will do anything for you and go out of their way to make sure you are having a great time. A few years ago we had a fortieth birthday there and from only asking if it was possible to have a cake we found the room with bubbly, fruit and a gift with card and the staff all joined in with the singing! - it was really good service. The area is great for some amazing visits and drives out. We won't mention them as some are still very unspoilt and they are there for you to discover! Overall I would not hesitate to recommend this holiday and if you travel with Thomson you get pretty good leg room too!

Entertainment at night was very good the day team would entertain at night and considering the hours they put in during the day was to a very high standard . Bus to beach even if you started to walk down or back from beach the little bus would stop to let you on Swap box in reps area was a great idea when you leave or go down to a lower factor just put sun cream in box for others to use if they need (this saved us weight and half full bottles in suitcases ) This is a holiday resort I would recommend to anyone and I will return there again.

We had a good time but feel it could have been better. ROOMS. The room were clean, the air conditioning cold and quiet so you can leave it on at night and shower was hot and powerful. The bathroom is separated by a curtain but it is large and has the optics and fridge in, its also where the large wardrobe are so you can put your cases out of the way. There is a safe in the wardrobe and its easy to use. The fridge is refilled ever 2 days if you want diet coke just ask or leave a note its no bother, there is an ice machine in the corridor. Also an iron and ironing board and clock in the room if needed. We would not say the double bed's were doubles as stated in the brochure, they were more like \u00be beds and far to small for a family of 4. It is a nightmare getting a good nights sleep if you have children who move around when they sleep. We did not know until the last day that we could have had a single bed put in the room which would have helped but would have made the room much smaller. When we booked the hotel we asked about a larger room or suite but were told they did not have any, in fact they do have suites, they are larger and have 2 bathroom with a bath and shower so it would of been a lot better for us with three male getting ready, (they are worse than women.) I was told by a family they had been given a free upgraded which had made their holiday much better. It seems that you haven't got to be shy, just ask for a free upgrade. I wish we had known as I would have asked on the first day of our holiday, I would have been happy to pay extra if I was not offered a free upgrade. Please don't be shy just ask! THE SPORT BAR This is a youth club for teenagers and children. It seemed to be the place where adults send their children while they watch the shows. On more than one occasion we saw older teenagers getting alcoholic drinks for the younger teenagers and then going in the toilet to drink them which made for a very rowdy environment. Our children liked to play pool (30 peso, about \u00a32 pound) with the friend's they had met, but we would not let them go on their own. There are fridges in the sports bar, with hamburgers and hot dogs you can heat up, also sandwiches and fruit THE MAIN BUFFET RESTAURANT This was a a little repetitive but all the food was well cooked and had sign's to say what each dish was. Every night they had a different main meal consisting of beef, pork, fish, Chinese, seafood and a barbecue. It could get busy and we found it very noisy but you can sit out side which was nice on a hot night and quieter. If you like wine with your meal then sorry you will be disappointed it has to be the worst we had ever tasted. We are not fussy and will drink most wine but we could not drink this one. (Please riu change your wine!) The waiters were excellent they don't bother you unless you ask for something and are always happy to get you a drink if required. They are also really good with the children. The ice and melon sculptors are amazing LUPITA RESTAURANT Is beside the pool and serve food all day starting at 10.30 with continental breakfast, and then buffet all day till about 6.00 it then changes into the steak house it has a bar and at at night it is lovely and quiet and over looking the pool if you have children ask the staff to make them a children's slammer. STEAK RESTAURANT It took us 3 days to book this restaurant. We were going down at 8am but you have to be there early 7-7.30am to book a table for that same night. When we made a reservation, a family tried just after us to book only to be told it was full, but that night there were lots of tables set but empty . The meal was nice but when we booked a 2nd visit we did not have a good meal. It was cold, the steak tough and the ribs were just fat on a bone. ASIAN RESTAURANT was O.K. but had the same food as the buffet restaurant. The boys did love the hot ice cream. POOL The pool was excellent, well kept and clean. The children loved the cocktail at the pool bar, but did notice that you had to wait longer to get served the second week not a problem just be patient. The only downside was if you wanted a sunbed beside the pool you have to be up between 7-8am. People reserve beds with towels very early and although the staff do go round and leave notes asking them not to, no-one takes any notice. The staff don't carry out what they say and remove them. There are plenty of beds around though so you can get one after this time but not always near the pool. The daytime entertainment staff were excellent and there is always something to join in with, but if you just want to relax then they don't bother you. They are great with the children and they loved playing all the games with them. It was nice to give the children that little independence as we felt they were safe to go and play the games on their own. Reception On most night they have something on in the reception, on Monday they have a small fair with candy floss and games. There is a entertainment board that tells you what is on day and night, what would help if they had what was on in the Yucatan, and the palacar, as well. There are people selling most nights please be careful, how much you pay, we made the mistake and paid far to much. If you go out of the hotel and turn left there are shops 5 minutes walk down the road you can get the same at half the price. 5th Ave is o.k you do get hassled a little, ( A taxi cost 5 dollars about \u00a33.50 ) we got a taxi there, and then walked back along the beach its lovely, take some water and sun tan lotion it very hot. It is a little difficult to know which hotel is which, because none of then have names on but just ask some one. You will recognise the rui staff. DOLLARS OR MEXICAN PESOS. We took dollars, but wish we had took pesos, some of the shops and bar have the prices in dollars and some in pesos some in both, if you pay in Dollars you get you change in Pesos and you never know if you are getting the right change or the right exchange rate. only thing I can advice is to take half and half, or wait till you get to Mexico and decide then. There are banks in 5th AVE and a bank machines 5 minutes walk, and you can get a better exchange rate if you don't pay commission. Mosquitoes always wait for me to get off the plane, but this time only 3 bite (a world record for me,) don't know if it was the vitamin B1, I always take 4 week before I go on holiday, or the deet spay constantly used, but something worked they have mosquitoes nets on the patio door but them damn things still get in. I took fly and mosquitoes killer room spray, and just sprayed the room as we left and had no problem. Take some drinks to the airport from the hotel they do let you though customs with unopened bottles. Water is 5 Dollars at the airport . Would we go back ? Sorry I have to say no, only because of the lack of sleep on the very small beds, the room not being big enough for 4, and the terrible sports bar. If you are going with children they will have a great time. I would be happy to answer any questions if I can.

Had a nightmare at first with Thomson as they kept getting the booking wrong and only received our flight tickets the day before leaving. When they finally arrived after chasing for weeks turned out my partners family had all been put down with the incorrect surnames. As this was the day before we couldn't get them ammended until we arrived at the airport! Once arrived at the Tequila I can safely say we had stepped into heaven! The whole holiday was amazing with brill food, drink, accomodation etc. We did unpack in a regular room but once they were aware that we were the bride and groom we were upgraded immediately. They could not do enough for you and all requests were met with regards to the wedding. It was the most amazing day that I had always dreamt of with no problems apart from my flowers being delivered to my room instead of my parents as instructed. This was sorted quickly with no worries. The garden for the wedding was gorgeous but absolutely boiling as there was no breeze and no cover. Once the ceremony was over we had a few photos with our guests and then the two of us taken to the beach in the buggy. Ate in the steakhouse which was absolutely gorgeous and we were put on one side of the restaurant which was ours for the duration. Although there were other guests in the restaurants it was still private and no worries about anyone else being there. I would tell anyone to get married in the Riu Tequila as they are fantastic as it is dealt with by the hotel/Riu and not Thomsons. If you wish to sort a special meal or ocassion out whilst there I would definately approach the hotel rather than Thomson as we booked an anniversary meal through thomson in the Asian restaraunt with banners etc to be placed up in the room and petals etc on the bed. These requests were not done and worse we were not booked in the restaraunt!! Luckily the hotel sorted the Thomson error and made last minute arrangements for us!!!

The staff can not be more friendly or helpful! Food was great, loads of choice, always hot and tasty. Ate in the steak house twice and the steak was so tender.

Sevice in the restaurants and the bars was always very good. The cocktails in the bars were great, they always had plenty of staff working so you never had to wait to be served. Wine is not very good, although the red was the best and drinkable!!! Never had any problems finding a lounger either by the pool or on the beach, some people do put their towels out to save them but there are plenty around. Our room was cleaned beautifully every day and often found various towel art animals on our bed when we returned. The entertainments team were fantastic, daily activities around the pool and great shows in the evening. The Grease show was the highlight, very professional. My husband and 18 year old daughter went to XPLOR and had the best day, booked with Thomsons, thoroughly enjoyed themselves. The whole family swam with the dophins which was another fantastic experience. We booked at the tourist box at Walmart near 5th Avenue cost $105 rather than $160 that thomsons were charging. We were advised to take Mexican Peso with us but found everything is priced in dollas so then had to be converted back to pesos, I would therefore recommend you take dollas if you want to book trips.

Everything on this holiday was perfect. The Riu chain have got it right. The cleanliness was second to none, never saw one place that needed any attention. Our rooms were cleaned by Gilberto who was excellent, doing the towel art daily much to our sons pleasure. Our favourite bar staff was Rossy who looked after excellent in the pool bar in the evenings. Their all inclusive is excellent, no restrictions on drinks and cocktails galore. No pictures of the cocktails just description so do as we did - try them all!! Food excellent, Asian and Steakhouse very good and on Tequila grounds. Mexican in the adjoining Yucatan. We ate at the Yucatan 2 lunchtimes whilst at the beach but in our opinion not as good as the Tequila and my boys nicknamed in the 'Yukatan'. Mexican speciality there not worth a second visit. Beach is excellent and always loads and loads of sunbeds. Staff at the Scuba and watersports centre on beach not too helpful, take it or leave it attitude. Sunbeds by Pool area hit and miss, but people flit between beach and pool so can always find one somewhere by pool. Big effort by staff to move resevered towels off if not attended, good idea in my opinion. Riu entertainment team very fit and energetic. Shows quite good to watch although all are mimed. Shows finish at 10.30 but then can go on to adults disco if you wish. Our first week the humidty was overwhelming, we were like limp lettuces, but week 2 the afternoon showers came which cleared humidity. We were told that mosquitoes were big problem, but I who am normally bit to death only had 3 bites. Used spray every night and plug in in room and think that worked. Gardeners also sprayed frequently. Went on trip to swim with dolphins through Thomson on the 'Brit trip' which was combined with a catamaran cruise and trip to island and was cheaper than main package pushed by your operators. Good experience and felt and natural as it could be. Photos and DVD a real rip-off but what other choice do you have? Playa del carmen visited one evening in a taxi. Lovely resort with lots of shops, bars and restaurants. Street entertainers down the McDonalds end - no real need to do the rest as that area the best. Lots of the trips appear to be to various 'theme parks' goods days out but very expensive when you have 5 to pay for and my 3 boys were happy at the hotel so why bother. Riu Palace not able to visit as they pay extra for exclusivity but looks very nice. Riu Playacar looked nice too, went in the day and night for a mooch, but could not fault Tequila so stayed put.

Additionally you may stop to pick up beverages along the way. This can be a lot of fun if you have good people on the trip and you like to see the other resorts. The next option is non-stop transfers. In my opinion this upgrade is usually not worth the cost because you still wait for the vehicle to fill up, you just get dropped off first and picked up last. The other option is Private, non stop. Someone is waiting for you as you leave the airport and away you go. Less than 1 hour Location \u2013 Not on the beach but still very good. You cross the street and walk 1/3 mile or so under a covered walkway to get to a beautiful beach. There is also a trolley sort of thing if you\u2019re willing to wait for it. While at the beach you can use the RIU Yucatan or RIU Playacar for loungers, pool, restroom, food and drinks. 30 minute walk into town or 50 peso cab ride. Also, we paid 400 pesos ($30) for taxi one way to Akumal for snorkeling, 320 pesos ($24) for the trip back. Taxis can usually hold up to 4 people. Grounds \u2013 large and very well maintained. Recently updated. Lots of cute critters running around. We\u2019ve experienced very few bugs. The walk from your room to the dining areas, pools, etc. can be quite a hike. Check In \u2013 Went quick. Some fruity drink was served as we waited to register. We were early so they suggested we go have something to eat and check back for our room. We left our luggage, went into some very nice changing rooms to put on our swimsuits and away we went. Came back an hour or so later and were escorted to our room. Towel art on the bed and luggage stacked neatly. Pools \u2013 large and clean. Yes, the towel game is played. Yes, certain folks wake up and sit at the swim-up bar until it closes. Lots of different languages being spoken. Topless allowed on beach but not at the pools. Animation team keeps things hopping all day long. Rooms \u2013 Recently updated. Very nice with towel art on the bed quite frequently. Very clean and no musty smell like a room nearer the beach. Shower only. Lots of marble so it can be slippery and noisy. Nice balcony with pretty view of grounds. Beds are very firm, but this has been the case in just about every resort we have stayed at in Mexico. We never have a problem sleeping in them. This is a large resort so make sure you let them know in advance if there are traveling companions you wish to be close to. Food \u2013 Good for an AI. Lots of variety and theme nights, but it is still mass produced food. Breakfast is good with cook to order stations. Lunch is different depending on where you eat. Burgers (different patties at different locations \u2013 some tasted like meatloaf), hotdogs (yuck), pizza, chicken nuggets, salads, desserts are all over. But there is much better food available if you look for it. The RIU Yucatan usually has something going on down by the beach \u2013 BBQ, Paella, etc. Dinner at the buffet is okay and we always found something to eat. The specialty restaurants can be good or okay depending on the night. More and more the specialty restaurants are becoming less special as they will have buffets for everything except the main course. The Steakhouse was at the RIU Yucatan so it was a bit of a hike, though it was nice to be down by the beach. 24 hour snacks in the sports bar are pretty lame. Round chips out of a bag and orange glop for cheese, microwavable burgers and dogs, some fruit or a salad in clear plastic containers. Liquor \u2013 Beer was being switched from Corona to Dos Equis. We like both. In the room there was a four bottle liquor dispenser with white rum, gin, vodka and tequila. All of it was pretty bad except for the Cuervo Gold Tequila. The in room fridge has sodas, water, tonic, and a few beers. Smallish plastic glasses for drinks at the pool. They do have decent booze if you ask for it. Jim Beam, Beefeaters, Havana Club, Schmirnof, Johnny Walker, Pernod, etc. The pool bars have a more limited selection than main bars. Red, white and sparkling wine are available but they aren\u2019t anything to write home about. Yet, It was fun to have Mimosas for breakfast one day. If you want more liquor in your drink, or a specific brand all you have to do is ask. The bartenders work very hard and are great. Tip them occasionally. I can never understand how people can say their drinks are weak when there are so many folks who need to be helped to their rooms before noon. Shows/Disco \u2013 The show are pretty typical for an AI. They vary by night and can be acts brought in or audience participation shows put on by the Animation Team. You will miss most of the show if you have a late night seating at the specialty restaurants. They can be a lot of fun and usually end by 10 or 11 at which time the Disco opens. Most AI discos draw a pretty small crowd. This wasn\u2019t the case here. It starts to get busy the later it gets. I think this is because some of the other RIUs don\u2019t have a disco and direct their guests to the Tequila. I really like that because I have been to other AI discos and there were about 10 people including the bartenders. Staff \u2013 The reason we keep coming back to PDC and the RIUs.

We are both in our early 50\u2019s with a young outlook. Mexico is a 10 hr flight from Birmingham (UK) with a 6hr time difference. With this in mind consider premium seating. The Hotel is approx 1hr 20 mins coach transfer from Cancun airport. The resort is typically Riu. By that I mean very clean, excellent service, very good food and accommodation to match. The rooms are in two storey blocks (total 16 rooms per block) spread amongst well-manicured lawns and gardens that encircle the resorts central pool and secondary restaurant. The pool is subject to continual cleaning and the water tested twice a day. In the grounds be prepared to see some of the local wildlife walking around, Agouti\u2019s, Coati\u2019s and the inevitable Iguana lizards. The Tequila is set amongst a group of other Riu hotels that you can also visit and use some of their facilities. The Tequila does not have a beachfront position but either a short walk or buggy transfer will get you to the beach in minutes. One of the other Riu hotels fronts the beach so you can use the facilities \u2013 eating, drinking etc. This and other hotels are positioned on a private road some 5 minute taxi ride or 35 minute walk from Playa Del Carmen, a town worth visiting. Although the exercise of walking is helpful to burn off the excesses of food & drink my advice is get the taxi, certainly for the return journey \u2013 it gets to hot to walk. However the walk does take you past some very nice properties, a little shopping centre and a group of preserved Mayan ruins. The rooms are spacious, well equipped, small terrace / balcony, shower, loo, hairdryer, iron and board etc, fridge re-stocked every other day with beers and soft drinks and a bank of optics\u2026hic.. TV with reasonable channels, and of course the most essential air-con and ceiling fan \u2013 you will rarely turn either off! In the approach corridors there are also ice cube making machines. Since your room are in a block of 16 be prepared to accept some noise from either guests returning late / early or children. Room cleaning, making the bed etc was excellent and many days we had towel art, petals on the bed and beer on ice etc. On our first day we also had a fruit platter and a bottle of sparkling wine. The Tequila has a number of bars and for the evening there is reasonable entertainment. The main restaurant is near to reception; here you can have breakfast and evening dinner. The usual carved fruits and ice carvings appear. All well presented, excellent choice of self-service foods with very good service. If you prefer a change of dinner environment you can book a table in the Asian restaurant (Chinese food, Sushi, duck, sweet & sour etc) which is self-service or book a table in the poolside restaurant for a five-course steak /chicken or fish main meal with waiter service. Both worth visiting. The house wine, red or white, is something that perhaps Riu should change but of course they are catering for all tastes, for 20 dollars it\u2019s worth buying a bottle of sparking wine (what they refer to as Champagne) for meals at the poolside restaurant. The walk to the beach takes about 5-6 minutes via a tree lined paved avenue. Beautiful coral sand (it doesn\u2019t get hot), usual palm tree\u2019s for shade and enough loungers to stretch out on. Bars etc within easy walking distance. The sea is warm but can be \u2018choppy\u2019. Coral debris, stones and shells can hinder getting in and out of the sea \u2013 but that\u2019s something to live with. Once in it helps to keep you cool and if the waters are calm enough then remember to take with you a bread roll from the restaurant?\u2026 you can feed the fish by hand. Nothing larger than tea plate size but it passes the time (they may also nip at your toes and legs \u2013 but nothing to worry about) Weather \u2013 most days I suspect the temp was hovering around 90-100 (damn hot if you are from the UK) with the occasional 10 minute thunderstorm / downpour at any time of the day or night.

Food was always available and at a very high standard considering the amount of people they cater for. Rooms were comfortable and spacious and just what u expect. Trips, after takin advise from previous trip advisor comments i decided to books trips from the booking shops around the corner and what a joke. Despite being promised it would be the same tour we heard about in our welcome meeting this was not the case. The price was cheaper than with our thomson reps, but in savin money we just wasted money. We decided to go to Coba and we knew it would take a few hours but 4 hrs on the coach picking up and over 10 hotels it seemed like we would never get there. there were no drinks available and the toilet smelt after just 1hr into the journey. The guide was ok but he was talking in german, spanish, italian and english. The lunch was disapointing and we didnt eat any of it. so after bein rushed around coba hearded round with 50 others trying to keep an ear open for the odd bit off history in our language we just went and did our own thing. the thought then of the same journey home was not ideal and not the way i want to spend my holiday. It was really clear how they made the price more cheaper cause it was a disaster. If u buy cheap you buy twice, when its either a pair of shoes, t-shirt, holiday or even excursion. Overall though i didnt let it spoil my holiday and when your in the rui tequila wh=ith the animation team, weather, food and great service i will be back again next year.

Be warned though that there are timeshare sales people in the airport who will say anything to get you to listen to them. They led us to believe that they were with Thomson. They are Not! Just walk straight through the airport where the Thomson reps will be waiting outside. Riu Tequila is in a gated community. So it is perfectly safe to wonder out day and night. 5th Avenue is in walking distance or $5 in a taxi. 5th Ave is full of shops (designer and souveneir), bars, restaurants etc. The hotel is spotlessly clean. We really couldn't fault it. The rooms are spacious. TV, Safety dep box and optics in the room. The food is delicious and cater for everyone. We enjoyed everything from Roast Turkey with cranberry gravy (better than back home!) to Sushi aswell as all the Mexican dishes of course. There are three restaurants, Asian, Steak and Buffet. No trouble booking in. We booked at breakfast for the same day evening meal. The staff work tirelessly in the restaurants, entertainment team and behind the bars (must taste the cocktails). There is a swim up bar in one pool and sports / activities in the other. There was a musical / dance show everynight that we were there. The children from the kids club could get involved and star in the shows. The dancers are worthy of any west end stage. They really were amazing! Don't be put off by the fact that this is not a beach hotel. It is a stones throw away from the hotel. Just a short stroll down a tree lined avenue to the beach or there is a golf buggy style train which will take you down. We walked everytime. The golf course is just next door aswell as a small shopping precinct with Santander bank, Starbucks, phone etc.. There is a chemist and hairdresser across the road. Everything is catered for. This is a smart casual hotel and we would recommend this to anyone. The Thomson brochure and website do not show this hotel to its full potential.

The whole complex itself is large, with rooms situated like a small village, mostly centered around the pool area. The rooms are spacious - we had a twin bed room, and these single beds were huge: they could have passed for small double beds! This was lovely. The decor is a little old, but it fits nicely with the Mexican feel. The bathroom is separated by a curtain from the bedroom, and the toilet has it's own door within this. The shower is wonderful and there is a large mirror and sink area too. Towels can be changed daily by the maids, all you have to do is leave them on the floor. There is a variety of TV channels too, mostly in spanish, but there are plenty of american too. There is one main buffet restaurant, which has various themed nights with a large variety of food to cater for everyones needs. There are also 3 other restaurants - an asian, a steak house, and a mexican. The asian is also buffet, but has a large choice of oriental food. However, the main restaurant itself hosts an oriental night, and we found most of the speciality restaurants food being served in the main restaurant. The steak house is a set menu, with some choice. I recommend this - it's gorgeous. And the pudding prepared right in front of you is awesome. We didn't eat at the Mexican which is situated down on the beach - we were told that there were a lot of mosquitoes down there, and that it wasn't worth the itching. The pool area is good, not as large as others i've visited, but still there is enough room for everyone. The swim-up pool bar is on one side, and the bar tenders are great fun. They enjoy squirting freezing water at the kids when the pool is more empty, and i even saw the guests pull one bartender into the pool - the are so laid back, it's a fantastic atmosphere. There are various bars within the hotel complex - a 24-hour sports bar, a pool bar and 2 lobby bars. These are all amazing, and the bar tenders will whip up anything you wish for - literally, and they don't hold back on the alcohol! The sports bar serves 24-hour food and drink which is useful for those with jet-lag on the first few days. It also has gaming machines, pool tables and air hockey. The pool bar/restaurant where most people eat lunch only has one rule - you cannot be wet when entering, and you must wear shoes - health and safety reasons and all! One of the best things about this hotel are the Entertainment staff, in one word - FANTASTIC. But in more words, they're always raring to go, and asking people if they want to join in. Not only do they pull-off the most amazing shows every night, but during the day the host a range of activities that are great to have a go at such as: rifle shooting, boules, shuffleboard, water polo, water volleyball (tequila style), volleyball, dance lessons, ping pong, horseshoes, football, rugby, aerobics, watergym, basketball, water basketball, and MORE. It's non-stop. I joined in with the water sports and sand volleyball, which plays late into the evening with everyone excited to go and unable to leave the tense matches being played. Not only are the entertainment staff amazing, but so are the other staff. You are always greeted with the utmost courtesy and they are always willing to help. The evening entertainment consists of a kids disco, a prize giving, and then a show put on by the staff - GREAT FUN. There is also a nightclub called 'La pinata' which is great, and you can meet people from other riu hotels who love to come here, because it's the only riu with a club - this is open until 2am. The beach is a little bit of a walk from the hotel, but is lovely. The water is the most amazing colour ever. Also, down on the beach there are photographers who ask if you want a photoshoot. These photos are later shown at a kiosk in your hotel lobby where you are able to buy them. They are amazing photos, edited and all, and i recommend this to anyone. We have some gorgeous photos and memories now. The hotel is a short taxi ride, or a longish walk from 5th avenue, and the party side of playacar. I recommend this too for people who are more into a nightlife on holiday. There is also a selection of shops here, and also at the shopping centre a 5 minute walk from the hotel. Here, there is also a starbucks for those craving a good coffee! Checkout is around 12, and is speedy which is again nice. Thank you Riu Tequila. :) I'll miss you.

Everyone who works in the hotel really do go out of their way to make your stay as special as possible, a small tip goes a long way for the workers and they are so so appreciative and will make sure you always happy and having a good time so they definatley deserve it! the beach is a 5 minute walk or a 2 minute buggy ride down a walkway. there is plenty to do at the Tequila and there is always activities going on, i would recommend the hotel for a family with teenagers rather than small children as most of the games are aimed at teenagers like water polo, tug of war, yoga and so much more! although there is a kids club for the younger children. There is a sports bar with internet, pool and other arcade games which will also keep them amused. during the day there is always things going on and at night there is a mini disco, then a show and at half past 11 the club opens and closes about 3 ish but if you want to stay up later the sports bar is open 24 hours! a 5 minute walk down the road is small tourist shops to get souveniers and a starbucks. To get to fifth avenue its about a half an hour walk or a ten minute taxi ride for only 5 dollars. There is loads of good shops with cheap designer clothes and stalls and is right on the beach. You can also use the Riu Playacar and the Riu Yucatan which are quite smiliar but the Tequila is deffinatley the livliest of the three. We went into Cancun to go to Coco Bongo which we also done two years ago when we stated in Cancun, i would recomend this club it is such an amazing night and is worth the money! its similar to a las vegas show and a night club in one! We booked two other trips through the hotel, the first was 'Xplor' which is about an hour coach journey but is a really good day. You go on zip slides through waterfalls, then you go on a small raft through the caves, then you get to drive little doon buggys through the forest and over bridges and last you do a river swim through the caves, its a fantastic day if you are quite active. The other trip we done was 'Captain Hooks Dinner Cruise' which is also in Cancun, everyone gets alocated 1 of 3 boats and each goes seperate ways you get a lobster and steak meal, play games and dance then all boats meet and put on a fighting show, its a good night if you are willing to get involved as they want everyone to take part! i loved our stay at Riu Tequila and would not hesitate in returning!", "Date": "August 21, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "nottingham", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful hotel, friendly staff and great food.\u201d", "Author": "sneemacker", "ReviewID": "UR75940090", "Content": "The hotel and pool complex is lovely. The staff are very friendly and helpful and the food was great. If you like all inclusive holidays you will love it!! Rather than write a review of the hotel I thought i'd include some useful tips that i wish we had know before going. Hotel tips - There is some great snorkelling to be had off the beach (which is a short walk or buggy ride away). Facing the sea, turn right and walk until you have passed all the sun loungers from the various hotels. About 100 meters on you will see a dark line in the sea where there is an artificial reef. Borrow a life jacket from the Yucatan sports centre if you are not a good swimmer (and snorkel gear if you don't have your own) and swim out to the 2 orange buoys that mark the area. The number and variety of fish here is amazing - better than on snorkel trips that we did to the Planacar reef where the coral was dead and the fish not so colourful. - The only air conditioned areas of the hotel are your room, the sports bar and the Bamboo restuarant. Every where else relys on fans to make it bearable as it is VERY hot in august. Mosquitos are also a bit of problem so bring lots of repellant. - A lot of women dressed up for the evening meal which i hadn't expected so bring something other than shorts & t shirt!! - Lots of activities to do in hotel. We were told that the min age for trying the scuba diving was 10 years but when we did it they didn't ask the age of our children (we have a 9 year old). The kids were also able to try shooting the air rifle at the targets and were welcome to join in lots of the general activities e.g water polo which was great fun (but got very competitive!) . There is a good kids club which runs from 10.30 -12 & 3 - 4.30pm. - Ther are lots of books to borrow behind the Thompson desk so you don't need to bring a whole library! General Tips -Dollars or Pesos? If you want to book trips through the hotel reps (see below) or are going to swim with Dolphins bring lots of dollars. They will take credit cards but will convert it to pesos first at a disadvantageous exchange rate 1 dollar = 13.5 pesos. Our trip for the dolphins was $198 which was @ \u00a3130 but would have been \u00a3143 in pesos. Everywhere else quotes dollars and pesos and it is cheaper in pesos. e.g. taxi to Playa del carmen $5 or 50 pesos. ATMs (there is one 5 mins from hotel entrance) will give pesos. There are some which give dollars but we were told that they exchange it to pesos then dollars so you get hit by 2 exchange rates then there is the charge for using an ATM so not a cheap option. Bring dollars for any large commercial trips e.g swimming with dolphins otherwise for the rest of any spending money pesos is cheaper. -Departure tax - $55 or 640 pesos or \u00a338. You can pay in any of these currencies. -Trips - Dolphins, Xcaret and Xel Ha seemed to be a similar price whether booked in the hotel or through a tour booth every other trip we saw was MUCH cheaper booked through the booths (there are 2 booths at the shopping area 5 mins from the hotel) E.G. Chichen itza - Hotel adult price $99 Booth $45 SAME TRIP. You pay $10 or pesos equivalent ( their exchange rate is $1 = 12.5 pesos) as deposit and the balance to the driver of the trip. You get a written receipt with all the details you need on e.g pick up time, balance to be paid etc and a contact number if problems (which no one we know did). Check out the booths before you book anything and haggle them on the price! Our Chichen Itza trip is shown as $55 but we got them down to $45 each and a reduction for the kids. A good trip to do. We also did Tulum using local buses (from the ADO station in Playa del Carmen). @ 45mins on bus (like a national express coach) which drops off at the Tulum bus station which is a 5 min walk from the Tulum ruins. 58 pesos adult bus fare and 51 pesos to get into ruins (children under 12 are free) Bring swim gear as you can access a beach from the ruins. -Suncream - @ \u00a315 a bottle in mexico so bring plenty! -WIFI - You can get wifi access if you bring a phone/computer but have to pay to use the internet on the computers in the sports bar $3 for 15 mins.", "Date": "August 19, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sheffield", "Title": "\u201cDon't believe all negative reviews\u201d", "Author": "SCohen48", "ReviewID": "UR75820523", "Content": "Lovely hotel.

I should preface this review with the fact that I am not an overly picky individual so to be not impressed with the hotel says something. The Bad: 1) Food was not definitely not a five star: I have previously stayed at the Grand Palladium and the food their was amazing especially compared to the Tequila. The food lacked flavour. It was repetitive. Their also was not labels on everything so there were times I had no idea what I was eating. It just did not compare to food I had at other resorts or on cruises an I AM NOT a picky person. They had no cream for coffee which I thought was weird but a small complaint. 2) Restaurants: There was only four restaurants you could eat at in which only two had air conditioning. Also, there are no washrooms in any of the restaurants. They are not too far off but in the Asian restaurant I had to walk to the lobby to use the washroom. Also, not a typical restaurant environment. More buffet style. 3) Rooms: First five star I have been to without a tub. Small room compared to most 5 star hotel and it was always damp. It was very uncomfortable especially at night. Obviously not the Tequila's fault but other resorts are on the beach and you get a nice breeze where on the Tequila you don't. 4) Not being on the beach is a problem in terms of humidity and heat. I have been on other resorts that were on the sea and you get a cool breeze and relief from the heat. In the tequila you do not get that nice breeze so the heat was unbearable. Also, the ONLY air conditioned place on the resort is the sports bar and your room. Aside from two restaurants that are closed during the day. 5) Few staff restaurant staff speak good English which was frustrating when ordering or asking for food. 6) The gym was PATHETIC!!! They should be embarrassed at how bad the gym is and really for a five star it is ridiculous. Not that you got a resort to go to the gym but it is nice to go a couple of days and work off the calories you are consuming. The Grand Pallidium in the Mayan had a fifteen thousand times better gym and spa. The Good: 1) Close to Playa Del Carmen which is a nice town. 2) The staff were friendly and I can;t fault them.

The flight from/to East Midlands was fine. Kids got a little bit crotchety but to be expected when they'd been sat on the plane for ten hours. Arrival at Cancun airport was appalling. Absolutely no organisation at all. Everyone scrambling to get through passport/baggage control. Red/Green light system. You press the button, if it flashes red you get your cases searched. It took us about an hour and a half from getting off the plane to actually getting on our coach to be transferred to our hotel. A total joke and the last thing you need after a long flight. Transfer time to hotel was about 1 hour 20 minutes, longer than I had been led to believe. Arrival at the hotel however was lovely, greeted with a fruit cocktail and very friendly staff. Porters take your luggage to your room for you, thank goodness, because I wouldn't have fancied dragging it all the way to our room. If you don't tip anybody else during your stay you should at least tip the porters. We did. I travelled with my husband and two young daughters. Our room was spacious but we were a little disappointed with the sleeping arrangements. Two large double beds pushed together for the four of us to share. With the heat it was just unbearable. We eventually asked for a small put up bed for our youngest daughter and it was brought to our room straight away. Ask at the outset of your holiday rather than suffer like we did! I have to compliment the staff of this hotel. They work tirelessly to keep the hotel and grounds spotlessly clean and everybody from maintenance man to barman greets you with a \"hola\". Our maid kept our room beautifully clean and left us some lovely towel sculptures! (Various animals, elephants, owls, bears. The girls loved them). We found the quality and choice of food to be excellent. We ate in the main buffet restaurant but also had three delicious meals in the steak restaurant (the girls loved the chicken here) and we ate at the Asian restaurant twice. We also used the Beach Club restaurant which served Mexican food. The beach was to die for. Stunning. On the days we used the beach we rinsed off and ate/drank at the Yucatan before heading back to the Tequila. The sunbed situation at the Tequila was a bit of a bind but I never went down there at 7.30 and I always found sunbeds by the time I did get there (9ish/10ish). Unfortunately our eldest daughter suffered a nasty ear infection and we were stung for medication and a hospital bill. The mosquitos are a problem. Lots of people were bitten really quite badly. You're better off buying your repellant when you get there. Ours isn't anywere near strong enough to cope with them. I didn't think much to the evening entertainment, I had hoped there would be a little bit more in terms of entertainment for the children. It finishes at 10.30pm which I thought was rather early and I've never known us have so many early nights whilst on holiday! I would recommend this hotel for couples.

We had a really nice and relaxing stay. We knew ahead of time that the resort was not on the beach but that we had beach access with the sister resort across the street. It's a 10 minute walk there or you can ride the golf cart that leaves every 10 mn or so. Actually, we spent each day on the beach or at the pool there - many of the louge chairs near the pool have a gorgeous view of the turquoise sea and Cozumel in the distance. Most are sheltered by palapas or umbrellas. There are also many palm trees there - very pretty. We took our large insulated mugs with us so we didn't have to make so many trips to the bars - they helped keep our drinks frozen longer too. The lobby of this hotel is really beautiful in it's old Mexican styling - something that appeals to us more than some of the super contemporary lobbies you sometimes see. It was nice that there is free wifi in the lobby too - I used my iphone to check on my email, news at home, etc. Also for anyone interested in keeping in touch with those back home. We have AT&T and used their Mx long distance package that runs about $5 for a month (we cancelled it when we returned home). That kept that rates low if I ever needed to call out, but I made sure that immediate family members had the phone number to the hotel so they could connect to our rooms, in which case there was no cost involved. We did have a problem with our room request and the front desk. We asked weeks before arriving to have our room near the main areas of the hotel because of a recent leg injury. We exchanged correspondence about this several times, but when we got to the hotel and reminded them, we were shocked to find that our room was actually at the furthest spot on their property! The did allow us to use a wheelchair until they could move our room. Also the air conditioner did not work well at all. It took a couple of days but they finally moved us - a pain because we had to pack up all of our things only to unpack and re-organize all over again. The room itself was adequate, the bed ok, fridge was always stocked, and the bar was always re-filled with liquor. We did have a problem with the phone in our room and they never were able to get it to work. There's a lot of wild life on the hotel property so don't be alarmed by the monkey-like animals, iguanas, etc. They're all over the place and everyone seems to take them in stride. We weren't all that crazy about any of the specialty restaurants in any of the Riu sister resorts or in ours either. We ate in most of them. We really enjoyed the buffet restaurant most and loved dining outside whenever we ate there. They grill out a couple times a week and the food was really good. My husband has a special low fat diet he has to follow and it wasn't hard at all for him to fiind a variety of things to eat at the buffet. We also enjoyed the fact that wine was available throughout dinner at the buffet. I've read many reviews from people who say the buffet got too tiresome after a few days, but that's usually the case with resort buffets. They did change it up some, but it seemed like they stuck with some of the main menu items much of the time. The entertainment at the hotel was ok. We've never been to an all inclusive where the entertainment rivaled Las Vegas or even better cruise line entertainment, but there were a couple of nights where we really enjoyed ourselves and the entertainment team works hard to give you a good time. We used Apple Vacations and flew on USA3000 from Cleveland which we just love. It's a non-stop flight and got us to Cancun by 9:40 AM. Our departure was less thrilling, however, because we had to leave the hotel via airport shuttle at 4 AM. It took about 40 minutes to get to the Riu in PDC from the Cancun airport, but that's with all of the stops at other hotels first. We did go into PDC one night to get a few souveniers but didn't really stay for anything more than a little shopping. For anyone who doesn't have the time to shop while at the resort, get to the airport in Cancun a litlle earlier - they have tons of shopping there too. We did take advantage of the massage on the beach which was really wonderful. We didn't do any excursions since we've been to Cancun and the Riviera Maya many times. We just wanted to relax and enjoy the beach, and this place really allowed us to do that.", "Date": "August 13, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Arlington, Virginia", "Title": "\u201cEverything was good, but not great. Good value.\u201d", "Author": "uncjillian", "ReviewID": "UR74968247", "Content": "My husband and I went to the Riu Tequila for our honeymoon in late July of this year. We had a wonderful time and found it very relaxing. I would say everything was good, nothing was terrible, and nothing was amazing. Location/Facilities The Riu Tequila is not beach side. No part of this property is on the same side of the street as the beach. This is not necessarily a bad thing, but it it somehting to be aware of. There is a shuttle that will take you down there during the day, or its about a 5 minute walk. The walk is nice and easy. You can also use the other Riu ClubHotel facilities (Riu Playacar and Riu Yucatan); we would go down to the beach and then use the Riu Yucatan's pool and bar while we were down there. The beach here is so beautiful. The water is beautiful blueish green and the sand is lovely. There were always plenty of chairs on the beach- we never had trouble getting one. There was a little bit of seaweed upon entering the water, but it was no big deal. We really loved the beach here; there was a refreshing breeze blowing pretty much constantly. There were several pools between the facilities and while we never fought over chairs, we did notice that they were definitely claimed during the morning and not given up throughout the day; this was definitely a common sight to see. We used the Riu Yucatan's pool (right on the beach) and would just leave our towels down by the ocean when we did this. Chairs by the ocean were always plentiful. Our room was fine. The location was excellent, by the back of the resort and in a very quiet area; we loved this. The air conditioning worked well and we didn't have any problems with moisture in the air. We had a room with a \"king size\" bed, but it was just 2 double beds pushed together. No big deal, but just thought people should know. The room did develop a weird smell after we had been there for a few days; we never figured out what it was or where it was coming from, but this was definitely odd. Overall, the room was comfortable and it was adequate. We went into Playa del Carmen once and found it to be very touristy (like many beach towns in the US, I would say). It was alright, but I didn't really feel the need to go back again. Lots of the same stuff every 10 feet and people trying to get you to buy buy buy. We also went on a 1/2 day trip to Tulum. The ruins and the beach there were beautiful, although it was a pretty small sight and the beach was too seaweed-y for swimming (in my opinion). It was a nice trip, but I wish we had gone to Chichen Itza or somewhere with a cenote for swimming. Food The food was very plentiful and was alright. I mean, they are cooking tons of food for tons of people everyday; it reminded me of some of the better college cafeteria food I have had. The breakfast food was delicious and plentiful; there were tons of options on the buffet. Lunch was alright- pretty repetitive; I definitely would have gotten sick of it if we had stayed much longer. We mostly stuck with hot dogs, hamburgers, french fries, fruit, and chips/salsa/guacamole. There is only one restaurant on the premises open for lunch; you can go to the other Rius for lunch, which we did, but we found that they offered pretty much the same foods. There were 4 options for dinner: the buffet, asian, mexican, and steakhouse. The last 3 you had to make reservations for and we ate at each resetaurant once (including the buffet). We got up each morning and made reservations; it was really no big deal to go make one. We did not like the mexican food very much (ironic, as we were in Mexico). The asian place had surprisingly good Sushi, actually, and the fried ice cream there was yummy; some of their entree options were only so/so but the sushi really was delicious. The steakhouse was also pretty good; the soup option was delicious and the steaks were alright. Not the best I've ever had, not the worst I've ever had. The deserts were mediocre- they all seemed to be some form of flan, but the cheesecake was alright. Service We found the service overall to be very good. We were a little overwhelmed upon check-in; our room wasn't quite ready, so they told us to check back in about an hour later. The initial interaction seemed brusque and the front desk staff at the time seemed more interested in flirting with some of the other guests than helping us. However, I will say that when we returned to check in, another Riu employee was very nice and helpful. Overall, the staff at the front desk, restaurants, and housekeeping were friendly and helpful. The bar staff were especially friendly and always quick to make you a drink. I can't speak that much to the entertainment- we didn't participate in many of the entertainment options offered, so I don't want to generalize. It didn't seem to interesting to us, but they obviously tried very hard, the very little that we saw. I didn't think it was very clear what the entertainment was or what the options were for activities during the day; we had never been to an all-inclusive before and would have liked more info on our options. Value/Overall Satisfaction Overall, we were very happy with our trip. We got a great deal though www.hotels.com and felt like we got great value for what we paid. We wanted to go somewhere and relax and have a good time and that's exactly what we did. Like I said, nothing was great and nothing was horrible, but we had a good time.

You have probably read some reviews giving the hotel a hotel a bit of a going over. Please ignore. Our trip to this wonderful part of Mexico was truly a memorable experience. Straight away on entering the hotel to collect our room keys you could see what a fabulous place it is. Met with a fruit cocktail by the management it was plain to see that they had your interests at heart. Our room backed onto the golf course which was nice because it had a private feel to it. Optics in the room aswell as beer and soft drinks in the fridge got my wife and I off to a good start. Air conditioning is good but have the fan on to give it that extra blow of coldness. If you tip the maid early on your room will get done quickly and you should get a towel animal left on the bed! The pool is split into two with the games and other activities held in the buffet side and the relaxing pool on the other side with the swim up pool bar. John W and Julio run that bar like clockwork and never let you down. I will say about the towels on sunbeds can be an issue if you do not get up early (07.30) but do not worry as most of the people want beds right next to the pool but there are lots more available under the parasols. If you have a bit of bottle pull off the towels on beds that have been left there for some time, take them back to the towel kiosk and get some more towel cards, then when the people turn up tell them that the pool attendant took them! All meals were top dollar. Starting with the buffet breakfast, absolutely fab. More food than you can shake a stick at. Do try the omelettes, made in front of you, so much to choose from. Buffet meals by the pool for lunch are good just to keep you going especially the salads. The evening meals are very good too. The buffet serves all sorts of hot and cold to suit all tastes. My favourite was the steak house. We ate there twice with the latter being extra special with champagne and about the best ribeye you will taste and all being served to your table.. the Asian restaurant was good too being buffet style, do book and try. Now for the evenings. The central bar which looks to the front of the stage is definately a highlight.. Donas (the geyser) and Gerrado who serve are top boys. Hand them a few dollars when available and you will not go thirsty. Look out for BIG NOELLA, dont upset her, she can be a bit of a character. The shows that the Animacion team put on are very good as all are choreographed by themselves and put in so much practise to make each one unique. Crazy James works his socks off to entertain. If you can sit right at the back by the bar as this seems to be the coolest area with some nice breeze. If you are still hot go into the Sports bar to cool off and get a banana mumba off Freddie as he wacks in the the alcohol! Do try the beach. Get the buggy down as this saves the feet but still a nice walk anyway ( 5 to 10 mins). You can eat down at the beachside restaurants for lunch and get all your drinks there too. A little tip is to buy one of the sealed lid mugs. You can use these to fill up and get lots more and you do not have to have the plastic glasses they supply. Loads of sunbeds that will never run out and the sea is just beautiful with the powder white sand. Do go to Coco Bongos on 5th avenue but maybe not on the Thompson tour as this was a bit of a disaster. See the animacion team and they will sort it for you with a private balcony. It is by far the best ever nightclub you will experience, shame they do not have them in England. Try Senor Frogs aswell as it is totally mad, Carlos and Charlies good too. If shopping down 5th avenue watch out for the street sellers, pain in the a***. If you only do one tour do try the Fat Cat boat and do it with Thompsons from the hotel. Ab fabulous, snorkelling brill.

The grounds are beautiful and have a tropical feel, the pools are lovely but as previously mentioned sunbeds are gone by 7.30 and it is quite shady with lots of reed umbrellas and trees. We went to the beach almost every day and this is much nicer - beautiful white sands, clear turquoise water, plenty of sunbeds. The sea was just the right temperature and there were some waves rolling in to keep it a bit more interesting. There is a bit of a shelf with grit and shells in it a couple of feet from the shoreline - this was fine going in but a bit inelegant when you are trying to get back up onto the beach! Didn't use the shuttle to the beach - walk was lovely and only 5 mins. The room was spacious and very clean and well kept - it is very dark and bit musty and has the most hideous curtains at the window and dividing the bathroom area but overall it was good. Plenty of drawers/wardrobe space and lots of hangers. The safe was a good size and I could fit my SLR camera and lens in no problem. I read a previous tip about the fact there were only two electrical sockets in the room and not one near the mirror so took a cheap four socket extension lead (2 metre) which was really handy and meant I could straighten my hair in front of the mirror. Hairdryer in the bathroom was good - don't bother bringing one from England - the volts are too low and it is really feeble. Mini bar was filled often with soft drinks/water/fizzy water etc. Optics were vile! Do take 50% Deet mossie spray and douse yourself in the evenings - if you really load it on it does work. Food was really good as per previous reviews - lots of choice. Drinks good too. Only criticism would be that drinks from the pool bar/self serve pumps aren't available until 10.00/10.30ish and if you breakfast early you sometimes want a drink before then and don't want hike to the Sports bar. Evening entertainment was quite good some nights but don't expect too much! Very hot and humid when we went and the only air-conditioned areas are your room and the sports bar - sometimes at lunchtime it would have been good to have some respite from the heat. All ice/salads use filtered water so no problem with stomach upsets. Tipping - we did tip sometimes but didn't feel under pressure to do so. This is a lovely hotel and all the staff work really hard to make your stay enjoyable - ignore any 'Butlins' comments -this worried me before I went and was completley unfounded, there are some activities around the pool in the day - if this isn't your thing - go to the beach - it's fabulous!", "Date": "August 11, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Reading", "Title": "\u201cExcellent...\u201d", "Author": "HOLIDAY2002", "ReviewID": "UR74788999", "Content": "Thoroughly enjoyed this Hotel. It's very clean. The Staff can't do enough for you. Everyone smiles and greets you with 'Hola'. Forget the pool and the slog of putting your towel on the beds by 0730, go to the beach...! You have all the facilities there at The Beach Bar and there are plenty of beds. It takes 6 minutes to walk from reception to a breath taking white sand and crystal clear sea... Or take the golf buggy, 2 minutes. Stand waist deep in crystal clear water and feed the fish with a bread roll or two. Very relaxing. The only bad point was the large group of Brits who had to display their Football towel like a flag and found it amusing to have belching competitions after their morning beer... say no more. The Dolphins are a must. The Royal Swim is $150 (\u00a390...Great value). But be warned... then there are the pictures... There didn't seem to be any price lists. We were initially quoted $500 (\u00a3300) for them on CD. Finally got 2 CD's for \u00a370. One video and one pictures. The entertainment is Very Good of an evening. We met with people from USA, Canada and UK from other RIU hotels who came across each evening as the atmosphere was much better than their own hotel. If you see 'Donas' or 'Veronica' behind the bar say 'Hola' and occasional tips will ensure your glass never goes empty. Taxi to 5th Avenue is 50 Peso, (\u00a32.80) each way. Gets you out for the evening and there's lots to see. We found the Peso was better value than the Dollar. (Depends on your exchange rate). Walk to the other end of the street and there you'll find lovely restaurants too. Although the hotel food is very good, you need to get out...! One thing we hadn't picked up on prior to going was the 'Exit Tax'. You need to pay \u00a338 or $55 or 640 Peso on departure, each...!

The hotel iteself is very nice, the grounds are beautifully maintained, the rooms are adequate and spotlessly clean and the pool area is lovely with plenty of shade available. The staff work tirelessly to make sure everything stays looking beautiful and are all so friendly and heplful. The entertainment staff in particular seem to be constantly on the go to provide all sorts of activities during the day. To get sunbeds around the pool is a bit of a chore. You need to be down with your towels by 7.30 to get decent beds with an umbrella and by 8.30 all the beds have been taken, its us Brits not the Germans! If this is not your idea of fun head to the beach which is beautiful and there are always loads of beds to choose from. The hotel is not on the beach, (seems to have been a surprise to other reviewers but you would surely know on booking with the minimum of research) but is no more than a pleasant 10 minute walk or 2 minute ride on the very frequent golf buggy. The food is of a good standard in the main restaurant with an adequate level of choice, although it is the same fare offered everyday so by the end of two weeks you do get a bit jaded with both the choice and the canteen like atmosphere. We ate at the steak house restaurant a couple of nights which was ok, nothing special, just made a nice change to eat somewhere different. The restaurants do need to be booked by about 9.00 each morning as they fill up quickly. There can be quite long queues for food both to get in to be seated in the evenings and also at the food counters to be served, this is particularly so at lunchtime. The entertainment during the day is plentiful, there is always something to do if you feel inclined, but you are never made to feel like you have to join in if you would rather not. We had teenagers in our family party and they really enjoyed taking part and meeting up witth new friends. The evening entertainment, however, is a real let down. It consists mainly of very amateur shows put on by the hotel staff and usually involves them dancing and miming to different songs. The theatre area is very hot and is usually packed with a fight for seats. The shows end at around 10.30 each evening and after that there is nothing to do at all unless you want to hang out with the teenagers in the Sports Bar or disco. Forget it if you are over 25! Why the Riu Yukatan or Riu Playacar which are on the beach don't have a nice bar overlooking the sea with a bit of music I don't know. I have never been on a holiday before where I was back in the room at 11.00 each evening, a real let down. There are lots and lots of mosquitoes, be aware, not the hotel's fault just part and parcel of holidaying in this climate. Do take extra strength repellant and make sure you apply it regularly. We did and did still get some bites but some people were absolutely covered in bites. One tip we were given which seemed to help was to soak a cotton wool pad with the Tequila from the optic in the room and rub it on to ankles, back of knees, neck wrists etc. Apparently mossies hate the stuff! Whilst we were there my son did come down with a very bad ear infection which he was referred to the local hospital with. He was on strong antibiotics and anti-inflammatories and was unable to go in water for several days which did spoil part of his holidays. I had not realised this was a common problem but having read the other recent reviews it does seem as if there is a problem with the cleanliness of the pool water and this does seem to be down to people being allowed to take food into the water. By the end of the day the water in the pool with the swim-up bar is quite murky because of this. This is definately something to be aware of and needs dealing with by the hotel management. Overall we had a good holiday, but it was not a great holiday. My teenage daughter enjoyed it the most out of the four of us and it does seem to be geared mostly to this age group. My son's time was spoilt by his ear infection and we were bored by the lack of any decent evening entertainment. Would we go back to Playa del Carmen, probably. Would we go back to the Riu Tequila, probably not.", "Date": "August 9, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Nottingham, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cWOW- what a holiday!\u201d", "Author": "Anderson18", "ReviewID": "UR74401253", "Content": "This hotel was quite simply fantastic! It catered fully for my wife and two daughters (16 and 22). We have never experienced such friendly staff and such a professional Animacion team- the shows they put on in the evenings were of West End, London standard. The hotel was very clean, the bedrooms spacious with good facilities (including your own bar!) and comfortable beds. There was always plenty of sunbeds, and both the food and drink were of good quality and wide in variety. The girls were pleased to find that unlike most hotels we have been to, people actually went to the disco! The beach was simply beautiful with far more sunbeds than people. Whilst we were on holiday, my wife and I celebrated our wedding anniversary and my daughter received her university degree result. The hotel could not do enough to help us celebrate- we had champaign, cakes, fruit, the rooms were decorated in beautiful flowers and balloons, and we were invited to have special meals in the steak restaurant, where we had our own menu and decorated table- not forgetting of course, the waitors' singing! We went on several trips through Thomsons- the dolphin training day, the Ruins of Coba and the Thomson bar crawl to Co Co Bongos. Firstly, the full day with dolphins, manatees, sting rays and sea lions was fab! The girls loved every minute of it and would recommend it for people of all ages. The Ruins of Coba were equally fantastic, although if you struggle with heights or have a low fitness level, you may struggle with climbing the pyramid. The Thomson's bar crawl was a disappointment- the second bar was very busy with only 2 bar staff on, and the drinks were rubbish- undrinkable! Many customers complained about this to Thomson's whilst in the resort but nothing was done about it. Luckily, Co Co Bongo's was absolutely brilliant- a very good show indeed and well worth the money. At the Rui Tequila, you can do as much or as little as you please.

There really was nothing wrong with the Riu Tequila and the staff are wonderful - the entertainment staff especially work so, so hard but it was just too busy for us. The hotel must have been full and it was just too busy for us. Negatives would be that unless we was down the pool area by 7.30am we could not get a sunbed which is a nightmare with young children, the queues sometimes for food were a joke. Think 10 people in front of you to get some pizza for lunch and some people were a bit pushy. That is why we switched and had the hotel been even a third less busy and therefore less chaotic then we would have happily stayed there. On the positives then are that it is spotlessly clean and the everyone from the pool guys to the cleaners to the entertainment staff greet you whenever you walk past them with a 'Hola' - so very friendly. The swimming pools are great (the larger swim up one can get a but grubby by the end of the day but that is down to people drinking in it and eating nachos etc but it is all cleaned in the morning) - have to mention that quite a few people young and old seemed to come down with ear infections around the Tequila pool (including one of my children) seemed quite common unfortunately. The grounds are lush and great with lots of interesting animals running round to amuse us and the kids, the rooms are fine but the alcohol in it looks more like something you would run a car on than something to drink (the optics in the rooms in the Palace were MUCH better) rooms are very clean and the maids work very hard, food was lovely but be warned a lot of people seemed to be suffering a lot with the 'runs'. I don't feel it was a reflection on the cleanliness or cooking techniques, just different food perhaps and the water they wash the fruit and veg in may have contributed - who knows but be warned as it seemed to be a common feature here. No sickness though and it didn't stop me eating and drinking but just bring some tummy tablets with you as unless you have a stomach of iron you will probably need it!

The entertainment was fine but after the evening show the place clears, there is nothing to keep you there if you are over 30, the disco was full of teenagers and everything else stopped, the hotel should extend the show or realise that not all us over 30's go to bed at 11. Over at the Yucatan they seemed to have realised this. The Bar Crawl with Thompsons....don't do it if it is that you want to do the trip purely to go to Coco Bongo my advice do the one on 5th Avenue not in Cancun, the bar crawl to Cancun takes about 11/2 hours to get there and although we were meant to be in the Thompson VIP in area in CB we were moved from our table by the management and people who had slipped them a few pounds when I colplained to the rep she said they had no control over who the management let in. at \u00a3100 plus for 2 you only get to see around 2 hours of the show....no where near long enough.

Looking for a 4-5 star? Not this hotel.\u201d", "Author": "Darkcloudandflypaper", "ReviewID": "UR73659179", "Content": "Not too sure how some organizations utilize the 5 star rating system. I have stayed at 5 star hotels. This is not. Nice, but more a 3.5 star at best. Not a bad value for what we paid at $800. I would never pay over 1000 for this place. First of all, very clean, and the service I found to be quite good. The food was repetitive and not too bad. Very average buffet flavour. The restaurants are a 3.5 star style. Average to poor. The \"Asian\" was all buffet and had frozen sushi! Terrible. The Mexican was better, but the same stuff they serve at the daily buffet. The Steak house is like going to order a steak at Dennys or Smittys. The rooms were nice and relatively modern built in 1998. We had no hot water for 1 week. We told the staff, but they never resolved the issue. The king size bed that was indicated in the reservation was 2 doubles pushed together. Yes, they split apart easily. The worst part, there is NO BEACH here! It's across the road at the other end of the other 3 RIU resorts, so not the end of the world. However, from the other end of the resort to exit is 8 minutes. Then another 8 minutes to get to the beach through a tunnel beside the Riu Palace. Which by the way, you are not allowed in. Like I said not the end of the world, but when you are in the crowded lobby of the Tequila at night and want to go to the beach, you really don't feel like walking 15 minutes through the dark tunnel pathway to the beach. Also, when you are tired later in the day, and think you can just waltz to the beach, you suddenly don't feel like walking the 15 minutes to get there. There is a shuttle going every 10 minutes, but in our case there are so many people utilizing it, we only got on once. Faster walking. Especially since the drivers would vanish every now and then and the hotel would have to call them to find out where they were. Doesn't sound like much, but it is an issue as was clearly expressed by other residents. The shuttle stops around 4pm. Sunquest was our operator at the hotel. Unfortunately you have to call them to arrange anything since they are only there to do the welcoming. The problem is, to book a excursion you have to call them. To book one excursion, it cost us 10 dollars U.S. in phone charges to do so. All the other tour companies where there all the time. Sunquest said we have to book through them since they are the only ones who offer a refund for bad weather. Of course, that was not the case with the other companies. Everything else was not bad. The pool is very crowded since the beach is so far away. All the chairs are gone by 10 am. The RIU Palace is much nicer and maybe worth the extra cost. Make sure your hotel is on the beach!", "Date": "August 3, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cardiff, South Wales", "Title": "\u201cA Gem of a Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Nervoussheep", "ReviewID": "UR73267094", "Content": "This is a fabulous hotel - the staff are lovely and the amenities are great. Unless you are the fussiest of eaters (in which case why choose an AI holiday??) there is something for everyone - an abundance of lovely food. The only fault we felt was that the wine served with the meals was poor. The Riu Tequila deliverd the best lunch of the hotels we tried (Yucutan, Playacar and Tequila) and it was great to have alternatives in the evening (Steak House & Bamboo) - we didn't do the Mexican in the evening as the hotel has regular Mexican evenings (with a staggering array of Tequilas to taste), and the Beach Bar is on the beach, so beware mosquitos. The beach has to be seen to be believed - white sand and azure blue sea - don't spend the whole holiday by the pool - you are in the Carribean - enjoy it! We returned to our rooms early one day, and were pleasantly surprised that cleaning ladies moved all the furniture to thoroughly clean the rooms every day - look out for the towel arrangements. The bar staff, paricularly at the pool bar (and indeed all the staff) work extremely hard to ensure that we had a lovely time, and the Thompson staff were very helpful. We felt that some of the trips were over-priced and there is a shopping mall within 250 yards of hotel where there are other tour arrangers who are willing to haggle and offer better deals. If you eat or drink outside the hotel, watch out for huge variations in prices. Weather - well, Thompsons are not responsible for this, but do consider that July is in the rainy season and there can be showers of rain, the likes of which we do not experience in the UK - however, it is warm rain, and if you are in the pool you are already wet!! In two weeks we had one day that was a complete write-off, another that was quite wet, and several others where it rained at some point during the day, but was otherwise quite hot. If you do nothing else, make sure you include a snorkel experience on the reef (we did Fat Cat, Xcaret and Jungle Tour) - you will see the second biggest reef in the world, and see a huge variety of colourful fishes. I was new to snorkling, and found it easy and a revelation. Make sure you have mosquito repellant - the hotel is on the edge of the Yucutan jungle, and they are eager to prey on the unprepared!!

We found the choice of food the first night impressive and varied this stayed the same for the 2 weeks of our stay although some dishes were repeated and all freshly cooked. The waiting staff were friendly and polite and efficient, The entertainment was varied and the staff put on a good show every night. Bar staff were friendly and good fun especially Rosie at the pool bar. The walk to the beach was pleasent down a path accross the road. Reccomend the beach at around sunset some fantastic skys. Being able to use other hotels bars is useful as you can get drinks and sit on sunloungers and look at the stars. Playa de carmen is about a 20 minute walk or a short taxi ride costing 50 pesos or 5 dollars there was allways a taxi outside the hotel lobby. Most of the shops will take pesos, dollars and euros. Trips can be arranged through the reps in the hotel. We did several during our stay and can recommend swiming with dolphins and coco bongos on the bar crawl was fun.

We travelled from Manchester with Thomson. It was our first long-haul flight and the first time we had stayed at an \u2018all-inclusive\u2019 resort. The flight, transfer to the Riu and check in were fine and without incident We read some of the reviews on this site before we went. Some people seem to have extremely high standards, and have \u2013 unfairly in our view - underrated the accommodation and other aspects. The rest of this review is in three sections, covering the resort, accommodation and things to do; food and drink; and excursions Resort Accommodation and things to do The accommodation is in a number of two \u2013 storey blocks laid out across the complex. The bedrooms are large and well \u2013 equipped. All have a balcony with table and chairs. The beds are comfortable. The power shower is excellent. There is a mini \u2013 bar containing beer (Don Equis XX); soda; 7-up; fanta; lemonade and water. The mini-bar is topped up every two days. There are also 4 optics containing gin, vodka, tequila and rum! For those who prefer staying in their room and watching TV, you can get BBC world news and one or two other English speaking news channels. Some movies are in English with Spanish sub-titles. There\u2019s a hair drier; ironing board and iron in the room. All rooms are air-conditioned and also have a large ceiling fan. Rooms were cleaned every day. There is a small shop in the foyer that sells a range of souvenirs, toys, clothes, beach shoes and sun screen, and also some newspapers, magazines and guide books. If you go outside the hotel and turn left, there are several shops about 200m along the road on your left, including a bank with ATM; a pharmacy, souvenir shops, and vendors attempting to sell you day trips. More of this later! There is plenty to do on site and locally \u2013 daily activities including volley-ball; darts; water polo and shooting. There\u2019s a tennis court and a marked area suitable for 5-a-side-football. Internet access is available in the Sports Bar There is entertainment every night, beginning with an \u2018interactive\u2019 slot where guests are invited to go on stage, and a professional show. We enjoyed the entertainment, and the area was packed for an \u2018Abba tribute\u2019 show. Although the music is not live and the words are mimed, the dancing is excellent. There is live music some nights, including a mariachi band and Latin blues/traditional music. The beach is about 10 minutes\u2019 casual walk through a covered walkway that runs between two other Riu Hotels \u2013 the Palace and the Yucatan. At the end of the walkway there\u2019s the Yucatan beach bar, and Tequila guests can use this for lunch and also to get drinks (tea; coffee, beer; soft drinks etc) which means you can spend the day on the beach! If you don\u2019t fancy the walk, there\u2019s a regular shuttle tractor. Food and drink We thought that the food was absolutely superb with an excellent choice for both omnivores and vegetarians! For breakfast you can begin with freshly squeezed fruit drinks (melon; cactus; pineapple etc). There\u2019s freshly chopped fruit; cereal; yoghurt; and creamy \u2018oat \u2013 pudding\u2019 (porridge). For cooked-breakfast, you can have eggs (poached, fried, hard or soft boiled; French toast \u2013 or eggie bread). The chefs will also prepare an omelette using ingredients of your choice. There\u2019s also sausage; baked beans, and bacon. In addition, you can have various bread rolls, toast, waffles, croissants; fresh fruit; cold meats and cheese; various Mexican dishes; salads; doughnuts; and so on \u2013 far too much to list all!! All can be washed down with as much tea, coffee, water or fruit juices as you can manage! There is a similar vast choice for lunch and dinner. It\u2019s true that some dishes may appear several times during your holiday. Which is good if there\u2019s something specific that you like \u2013 and also good because it might persuade you to try something different! In addition to the main buffet areas for meals, there are three \u2018specialist restaurants\u2019: Chinese; Mexican and a \u2018Grill\u2019 These have to be booked in the morning at breakfast time, and we tried the Chinese which is buffet style, and the Grill, which is waiter-served. Both were OK, though we were a little disappointed with the Chinese selection, as many of the items on the menu also appeared at the lunch and dinner buffets In all dining areas, tea, coffee, a range of soft drinks (coke; 7 up; Fanta etc); water; beer and wine is \u2018on tap\u2019 and you can help yourself to as much as you want, when you like! There are four main bars \u2013 one by the swimming pools; two close to the hotel entrance, and the 24hr Sports bar. All are good, though we preferred the 2 near the entrance as they were close to the stage. The bar staff work very hard to provide a range of cocktails and other drinks, using \u2018brand\u2019 sprits such as Smirnoff; Ron Bacardi; Gordon\u2019s Gin etc. Quantities are very generous! The 24hr Sports bar is also close to the stage. There is less choice at this bar, but you can have tea and coffee and there is a range of sandwiches and burgers etc. In addition, there is a pool table and various game machines. Internet access is also available, and there are around 10 TV screens showing different sports. Excursions We went on three \u2018excursions\u2019: Playa del Carmen; Chichen Itza; Tulum/Coba; Xcaret Playa del Carmen isn\u2019t really an excursion, as it\u2019s a half hour walk or 10 minutes by taxi at a cost of 60 pesos. The main destination for tourists is 5th avenue. But beware! We got a lot of hassle from vendors, including those who try to sell you day-trips. We stopped to listen (mainly to be polite) but some vendors got a bit nasty when we didn\u2019t sign up for a tour. Some vendors can be intimidating as there may be four of them in the shop front, all beckoning to sell their wares! Best thing to do is to go early evening in a group of four or more and to completely ignore them! There\u2019s a \u2018Walmart\u2019 in Playa del Carmen but it\u2019s nothing special \u2013 a bit like ASDA in the UK with prices much the same The night life and bars etc are supposed to be good in Playa, but we didn\u2019t partake so can\u2019t comment! Chichen Itza. Thomson well try and sell you this for $99 (US). The local vendor in the shopping area near the Riu Tequila charges around $65 (or less). You pay your money and take your choice! The vendor near the Riu Tequila is a salesperson who belongs to a chain of sellers, some based in Playa del Carmen. They share around six (or more) minibuses and pick up from the locality. They all meet up in a lay-by along the highway. This means that your journey can be longer. People who went with Thomson seemed to have longer at Chichen Itza and their guide had more time to show them around. Our trip (like |Thomson\u2019s) included a visit to a cenote near Chichen Itza. This is a spectacular fresh water pool, part of a complex of underwater streams. Lifejackets are available and there are changing facilities, a shop and restaurant. We only had an hour there so felt we didn\u2019t have time to go for a swim Note: You can spend more time at Chichen Itza and at the cenote (and indeed elsewhere!) if you are happy to drive and escape from the Riu for a night! There\u2019s a motel close to the entrance of this cenote and only a few minutes from Chichen Itza. B&B accommodation at the Hotel Dolores Alba is only \u00a330 per room so it\u2019s worth staying to have more time at the cenote and at Chichen Itza. There are also some famous caves nearby that are worth a visit. It\u2019s also the opportunity to try some traditional Mexican food! www.deloresalba.com There are plenty of car hire places in Playa del Carmen Xcaret- Is about 15 mins by taxi from the Riu. What can we say! This is superb! It\u2019s a bit pricey, but the Xcaret \u2013plus ticket is worth every penny and includes two drinks each, a buffet lunch and entrance to the park\u2019s main attractions. It also includes a locker and towel should you wish to go swimming. It\u2019s great for a family day out - or even if there\u2019s only two of you - to keep you entertained from dawn to dusk! There\u2019s plenty of wildlife - monkeys, alligators, manatee, dolphins, turtles, stingrays, a bat cave, butterfly garden, puma, and lots of different birds (etc etc) . There\u2019s a beach, a Mayan village, and there are several exhibitions and displays such as a rodeo and a traditional Mayan dance/rite that concludes with the Mayans spinning upside \u2013 down from a huge pole There\u2019s an extra charge for swimming with dolphins, scuba and some snorkelling activities. You will need to take bio-degradable sun-block with you as the usual stuff contains ingredients that damage the coral The highlight of the day (also includes in the admission price) is stage show in a huge auditorium (ball court) which traces the history of the Mexican people and their culture through music and dance. It lasts for two hours and features games of Mayan \u2018football\u2019 and \u2018hockey\u2019 The music is live and the costumes are excellent. A great day out (we should have booked for two days as we didn\u2019t get to experience everything in one day!) Tulum and Coba Again we went with a local vendor rather than Thomson, and again we would have liked to have spent more time at the sites, particularly at Tulum. This was a single day trip to Tulum and then to Coba The Mayan ruins at Tulum are not as spectacular as Chichen Itza but are worth a visit because of their cliff \u2013 top location above an excellent sandy beach. Coba in contrast is surrounded by jungle, and you can either walk or be taken to the ruins by rickshaw - style bicycle. You can climb to the top of the pyramid though it\u2019s quite steep, but worth it for the views.

The food was good for an all inclusive and above the standard we expected and the best AI we have had, especially the speciality resturants. The beach was nice and its good that you can use the nearby hotels facilities. All drinks were brand rather than local produce. Our rooms were always cleaned and fridge restocked. It was a great place and great hoiday (must go on trips). The only 2 downsides are that from some rooms you can hear noise if people are walking back late and being loud, although this was a rarity. The only other thing was that you have to grab a sunbed early if you want to be by the pool (the same as most holidays) but if you couldnt get one, we just went to the beach. So all in all, if these are the only down points then its not bad at all. We have been to the maldives and its a toss up between which we liked the most.

The welcome, the rooms and all the facilities are first class and could not be faulted. A number of honourable mentions to the staff, Juan, Julio, John and Avimael at the Pool Bar (your work levels and skills at producing a constant and vast array of cocktails was outstanding \u2013 especially when the pool was a burst of red and yellow when the Spaniards invaded after their World Cup win\u2026.well done and Yo Soy Espanol).

From 10am in the pool for basketball, volleyball, boules, aerobics and all the other activities to well past 10.30pm in the Theatre after another well thought out presentation/show, they work non-stop to ensure that we all have a good holiday. Crazy James, Jamie, Pablo, Richie (I hope they sort out the truth from the lies), Christina, Jazmina and all the others I would employ any of you in the UK, you are a credit to the Tequila.

Food in the buffet was very good - you could eat soemthing different every day for a month if you were lucky enough to be staying that long! The al a carte restaurant were also great. We went to the steak house and Mexican. Biggest and most tender steak I have ever had. We took pesos, although all of the prices were in US$. I would recommend taking pesos though, as with the exchange rates, I found you paid more for everything if you paid in US$. Hotel entertainment wasn't our cup of tea, but the entertainment team work very hard. We found entertainment at the Yucatan to be better - they had differing Mexican bands on every night at 11pm and that was just what I was looking for. The Yucatan was a 2 minute walk to the right of the Tequila adn the Playcar was 2 minutes to the left (PLayacar hotel very small though). A taxi to Playa del Carmen only took 6 minutes and was not expensive 50 pesos (under \u00a33) - plenty of bars and live music venues there, as well as massive shops.

We didnt hear much from thomsons before we went so we werent holding out much hope for everything going to plan but once we got there we met with the wedding team who were fantastic and everything was perfect. (if you want to know more about weddings at this resort you can see my pics on facebook my name is Elaine Jones) ok so now about the holiday itself, the staff work SO SO SO hard everyone from the pool cleaning guy (who actually got in the pool and scrubbed it with a brush) to the cooks, waiters and cleaners all of which are constantly smiling and saying \"hola\".. Each and everyone of them work hard to make the hotel so fantastic that you just dont want to leave. We had 12 amazing sunny days and a couple down pours but its the time of year isnt it?! If you just want to sit by the pool and have a drink then sit on the side of the pool where the pool bar is and you glass will be filled before you've even finished drinking.. on the other side of the pool they do things like water aerobics and water basketball, dancing, spannish lessons and lots more, the entertainers work from 10am rite through till they finish on a night time at 11pm they are so lovely.. one bit of advice, take some dollar bills to tip with, they are ever so grateful for $1 and will get you straight to the front of the que at the bar.. We reccomend using the safe in your room (you pick your own personal code) we used it and everything was safe and well.. our maid kept leaving us little towel animals and one day left us a real rose in a can which was a nice little touch :) they restock your minibar and \"optics\" every other day which is great.. oooh so much more to say but not enough space.. We didnt do any trips as it was our wedding but when we go next i think we may do a few different ones although if you dont want to thats fine because there is always something at the hotel to do. FOOD is to die for, deserts are my weakness OMG oreo cheesecake is a must with some nut icecream mmm yum...!!!!!! we got told by thomsons to take paceso which is the currency over there but most things in shops in is dollars so take them instead.. 5TH AVENUE for shopping is a must, $5 taxi ride for 5min journey but agree this with taxi before u get in!!!! oh so much more to say, enjoy the shows they are great, the entertainment staff make sure everyone joins in and has a ball.. if you have any questions feel free to message us and we'l be happy to help.. must try the tequila \"boom boom\" !!!!!!", "Date": "June 28, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wrexham, North wales", "Title": "\u201cWhy complain you in Mexico ??\u201d", "Author": "sunnydays65", "ReviewID": "UR68560355", "Content": "Just returned from Riu Tequila and was a little worried being an expensive butlins as one review read but a holiday is what you make it and and we all have different tastes, So I am going to give hints and tips and if you want to ask anything just email all I can say I glad we chose this Riu Tequila as the others in the area were not a patch on the serivce in the Tequila. Flew with Thomspon paid extra for leg room worth every penny did consider premium as a treat but glad we didn't as really only extra you get is all Inc drinks and bit larger TV, pay the extra \u00a35 to upgrade your TV as this makes a massive difference you can pause, rewind and have extra facilitie, without the upgrade once film starts you have to watch. Transfer is well on an hour you are offered drinks on the bus but these are not part of your all Inc 3 dollars but nice and refreshing. Checkin is very quick and organised met buy hotel staff envelope with everything you require sticky labels you put on case and porter brings up I had no money for his tip he was totally fine with this. rooms exactly as pictures people have provided on this site fridge stocked up to be honest we hardly used it maybe when we went back to room had a vodka while getting ready but was always plenty they didnt have diet but popped to reception one day then was always filled with diet pepsi just ask and they will try and help whenever they can. We did three trips Xel-ha not too far on bus pick up at 8am back at 6pm all Inc restaurants and bars are plenty her with exceptional food, cost 99 dollars ea. If you want picture 13 dollars. Next trip was morning trip pick up at 10am then onto speed boats then snorkelling very hot cover your legs as we learnt from this previous visit burns your knees really bad use your towel while in boat saves alot of sore legs next day cost 80 dollars scary but fun amazing for the snorkelling free picture which makes a change. Even though trip based in Cancun trip back was a bit long winded as we took other people back that where no where near our holiday so bit tired after can be good couple hours to get back so maybe Thompson might look into it. Third trip CoCo Bongo's ok if you go with Thompson this costs about 80 dollars each you go around a few bars in Cancun then onto Coco bongos and leave at 1.30am then a long trip back home on coach. We where advised to go the one in Playa del Carmen as supposed to be just as good. We decided to do this and what a night it is it is a must if you speak to Josh one of the many entertainment guys around the area mind you we didn't get involved with any of the day time activities they where there like everywhere. Joshua organises everything and costs 50 dollars all Inc big saving and exactly the same treatment as you would with thompson have reserved table own waiter taxi there only difference you have to get your own taxi back as they let you leave whenever show starts 11.30pm till about 2.30am but then you can stay and party after all your choice taxi costs 5 dollars back. We did venture out and look at other prices but to be honest Thomson was pretty much average with the others bar few dollars. Do have the list of prices for a number of trips so if you want to bugdet just drop me a line. Food drinks bar service whatever you wanted really cocktails plenty of different tequilas you will get used to the bar staff slamming tequilas. As people have said bookings are taken up pretty early when you go to breakfast and the man is on the door by the podium then there is still availability we had the steak house three times and the chinese once all are set menus steak house waited on others self service. Some people made the effort in dressing for dinner others ddin't but you didn't feel silly with your nice dress on i didn't anyway lol. Two pool areas one with the pool bar so as you can imagine does get rather loud there and the other side is the not so loud side, there where not alot of americans there when we where there if so we never heard them, you read comments about them being loud etc but no one worse than us brits some of them put us brits to shame no wonder we get a bad name abroad. Last but not least the beds you dont have a cat in hells chance of getting the perfect bed unless you get up at stupid oclock time sorry I am on holiday i not doing that but it is that hot there the moment you have to be mad to sit out in it all day I love the sun but was too much for even me so by 12ish people starting leaving beds anyway we always found a bed if you wander around. The buggy to the beach is excellent frist week we walked you now trying to be good 2nd week we waited for buggy beach busy but plenty of beds i took umberella in suitcase was perfect for beach.

I liked the resort in that it was very \"jungly\" feeling, lots of trees and foliage. Liked the lemurs running all around the resort. A very low-key atmosphere which I love. Food: Buffet was very good, lots to choose from at breakfast as well as dinner. Only wine is offered at dinner so if you want cocktails with dinner you need to stop at the bar beforehand. Asian restaurant \"Bamboo\" was just average. Same with the steakhouse \"Lupita\" I found the steaks tough but all the appetizers, soup and salad was good. We didn't eat at the Mexican restaurant but heard it was good. Food in the sports bar was terrible. There is no other food available after dinner ends at 10:30 so this is the only option but it's packaged sandwiches, burgers, hot dogs and pizza that are not good at all. Drinks: You get what you pay for. The drinks were okay, but not as good as I had hoped. All are made with second-rate alcohol, and mixed with juice drinks, not real fresh juice. So most of the fruity tropial drinks all tasted pretty much the same. The margaritas were terribly sweet until we told one bartender who would actually listen how to make it properly (with no sweetener added, and extra squeezed limes) The alcohol in the rooms sat untouched because the only mixers they leave in the fridge are soda and tonic water and I think some orange juice - again not real juice. But I managed to have my share of drinks! The mango daquiris were good as well as the Tropical Pick Me Up with rum added. Never had the beer but it was DosXX on tap. The bartenders were always very friendly, fast and efficient We did tip a dollar or two most times we ordered though it's said not to, and it was very much appreciated. Entertainment: Shows were really quite good, the staff tried very hard to make the evenings fum. One night there were carnival like games to play thet were fun,another night was gambling in the front lobby. My only complaint on this is that there is not much to do for teenagers after dinner - it would have been nice for them to open up the disco for teens until 11 or 12 then have it for adults after.

Cleanliness: There are always cleaners around the resort making it spotless for all the guests there. You honestly could not fault them. Everything from the rooms to the restaurant were immaculate. Location: People who complain about it being a 5 mintue walk to the beach need their heads examining!! If you are seriously too lazy to walk then they provide you with a golf buggy type vehicle which runs all day, every 5 minutes and takes you right to the sand!! There are also lots of little shops about 2 minutes away, including a starbucks. The resort centre, playa del carmen, is 5 mintue taxi ride and will cost you $5 to get to.

The beds were comfortable enough and the shower was always the right temperature. The only problem we found with the rooms, and I know it sounds petty, is that there was no light in the shower! Although there was some light coming from the rest of the bathroom it was still quite dark in there making it quite difficult sometimes!! Service: With a smile and always very prompt.

Sadly, because of the restaurant, the Tequila did not live up to this standard. The Tequila allows you to go to dinner wearing what you wore to breakfast (flip-flops, beach shorts, T shirt and baseball cap), on only one occasioin did we see someone refused entry. We also found the meat to be tough and so usually went back to get chicken or fish. The quantity of desserts was fewer than we have usually experience, although what was there was good. Only once a week was there any kind of show cooking. Breakfasts saw fewer choices than our previous experiences and so became a bit repetative after the first week. However the waiters were good. Turning to the Steak House where we went tiwce, booking was no problem and on the first occasion it was good but on the second we waited over 1hr 10 m for our main meal, the waiters running around like headless chickens on this occasion. We also found the drinks watered down more than normal. That's the bad point out of the way, now for the rest of our experience: As said many times the check-in was of the normal RIU standard, quick and efficient. Our rooms were very clean and well air conditioned. However we did have a problem with mosquitos and bugs which we recognise IS NOT the hotels fault. Despite a fly screen on the patio doot they found their way in. However we went to a mega supermarket in Playa and got plug in Mosquito repellant unit and a Roach trap for half the price of the local supermarket down the road. The hotel also fumigated 3 times whilst we were there. If you take a plug in unit check it works for 110v as 240v ones are inadequate. You may also want to take a plug extension lead (\u00a31 shop) if you have several electrical items as there were only 2 electrical sockets in the room. The room was kept very clean and the maid made towel animals every day (we did regularly tip her). The Thomsons welcome meeting was the normal trip sales pitch with little info on local facilities etc although the reps were always on hand to answer questions. During the meeting the hotel manager stressed the importance of not feeding the animals, however this was not enforced by the rep - quite the opposite! The hotel grounds were maintained well as was the pool area(s). You could get a sun lounger here up to about ten o'clock after which time they were all taken, many by invisible guests. Again despite notices forbidding this the hotel did not enforce their policy. Evening entertainment was of the normal animacion tean quality, some good, some not so good. This was supplemented by outside entertainment on accasions. However, as guests from the Playacar and Yucatan came to watch this entertainment you could not have a quiet seat in the lounge after 9:00. The beach was good but be carefull as you enter the sea. You have to step on crushed shell and coral and there is also a step down where the waves break. Once past this the sea bed rises again and although choppy was always warm and great for a swim. If you take a bread roll you can feed the fish. There are a number of massage outlets on the beach but we visited on recommended on TA in Playa which was half the price. There are lots of places to book trips and if you can wait until the day before to book then you will get a really good price. We also booked to Coba beforehand with a company recommended on TA which was a great day out. Remember Coba is the only pyramid you can now climb. We recommend taking Pesos and Dollars as most things are cheaper in Pesos (Airport taxis, taxis, shopping) but for trips they want Dollars. Make yourself a currency converter then you can decide what to pay in. Hope you find this useful and if you want to ask any questions then do.

(which is more than can be said for Thomsons) Special praise for Julio at the pool bar and Eder at the kids club, my little girl has never had so much freedom on holiday, I signed a form to say I agreed to let her walk back on her own if she left early and I observed Eder with the kids one day and he never let them out of his sight. Can't fault any of the staff, they really do work long and hard! This hotel stands out for staff service and cleanliness, if I had to gripe it would be air con in rooms was not cold enough and non existent around the rest of the hotel, also the sunbed situation was a joke, getting up at 7am to get a sun bed is ridiculous, and despite notices being put on reserved beds it made no difference. The pool area is also very shaded from the jungle surroundings so you have to keep moving your bed if you are a sun worshipper like me. Mexico is a destination I have wanted to vsit and it didn't disappoint, the beaches are beautiful, the people friendly and there is plenty to do. We booked all our excursions at solotinos on fifth avenue without any problems and they were much cheaper than Thomsons. Chichen Itza and swimming with dolphins at dolphinaris is a must!", "Date": "June 18, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cUpmarket Butlins\u201d", "Author": "hotfemail1", "ReviewID": "UR67902904", "Content": "I went with high expectations as this hotel had been recommended and I thought it was a four star resort.

If you want a hotel like a holiday camp this is thie place for you but if you want somewhere more select this isn't the place. The beach was lovely but a 10 minute walk or 5 minute shuttle ride and the sea was very choppy so not easy to swim in. The two pools in our hotel were very hot so not a pleasure to swim in.

The hotel was very clean and the staff were extremely friendly and hard working. The food was very good and there was always alot of choice but I thought perhaps it could have been a little better. We ate in the steak restaurant and the Asian which were not as good as the main buffet restaurant but the fried ice cream in the Asian was delicious so worth a visit just for that! The beach was fantastic, only a 2 min walk from the hotel. We done 7 trips which we enjoyed and recommend, the best were Trainer for Life, Jungle Tour and Captain Hook - really cheesey but you end up having a fab time! I would recommend you just take mostly American Dollars. We took mainly Pesos and ended up paying alot more for the trips and other things so definitely take enough dollars to pay for your trips atleast! I must say I would highly recommend the hotel for families. All the kids seemed to be loving it! I think people who have gave this hotel a really bad review and complained alot are either stupid or very tight as you can't expect perfect luxury for the price you pay for the Tequila!

The Riu Tequila is simply beautiful! We were a family of 2 adults and 2 children of 11yrs and 7yrs, it was our first time to Mexico, we have been all inclusive in lots of 4* hotels in Turkey, Egypt etc, but none of these came anywhere near as good as the Tequila. The hotel is immaculate, i am a fussy traveller, and like my hotels to be very clean, and wow, this one certainly is! Even the pool side toilets constantly had a maid in there cleaning. The grounds are beautiful, garderners even had a huge hairdryer type machine blowing the leaves of the paths! Below is my summary: ROOMS: immaculate, very, very clean. Maids do a fantastic job, and leave different towel animals most days. A/C wasn't very cold at times, but once the ceiling fan was on, it was cold enough! Minibar stocked up every 2 days with huge bottles of water, coke, 7up etc. Beds were bigger enough to sleep us 4. FOOD: We thought the food was fantastic, plenty of choice. Breakfast was brilliant, omlete made with what ever ingredients you choose. Loads of different choice, i loved the pancakes with maple syrup :) Lunch time did get quiet repetitive, but always hot fresh food, or salads and fresh bread. The self service ice-cream machine is wicked, kids loved going up and making their own cornets, mr whippy style! Self service popcorn, nachos and all the fizzy drinks/beer/juice etc. Dinner time was fab, different themed nights,lots of gorgeous ice-cream flavours with choice of sauces and sprinkles. The chefs and waiters line up outside the resturant at opening time, and then clap as you walk in!!! A waiter then escorts you to a table, we had the same waiter for the whole 2 weeks, we tipped small and regularly, and he soon knew what drinks we liked, and had them coming through the evening. My kids were so fond of him, they made him a \"farewell\" card when we were coming home. POOLS: We tried the swim up bar pool on our first day, but found the water a bit grimy, think it was due to the amount of alcohol getting spilt! The cleaner did go round with a net fishing out leaves etc, but we prefered the other pool, which was perfect. The built in sun loungers were fantastic, as it was just too hot to sit in the sun (and i am a total sun worshipper) BEACH: Wow, Wow, Wow, it is like something dreams are made of, simply paradise. Plenty of sunloungers, no trouble getting a bed anytime of day. The walk is quick and lovely, but we were lazy and hopped onto the big golf cart for the ride, it really is no issue, and much prefer our hotel to the Yuctan on the beach. Their pool side toilets were never cleaned and had a funny smell, the atomsphere of the hotel was nothing like the Tequila, and didn't even want to eat down there. We used it to get drinks whilst on the beach, but that was it. LOCATION: Brilliant, only a $5 cab ride to 5th Ave with loads of shops. Aslo in easy reach of most trips. The hotel is set in lush tropical gardens, and it was heaven waking up to the sound of the exotic birds. Loads of raccoon type animals come out in the afternoon, one time we had about 40 of them round us whilst feeding them, the kids loved it. STAFF: omg, they work so,so hard. The entertainment team were brilliant, they work all day then all night, always with a smile on their faces. They became friends to us, and we had such a laugh with them. They do salsa lessons, yoga, spanish lessons, water polo, volleyball, table tennis, and water arobics round the pool. Once a wk they also have a tropical pool party with a live band, ice carving, melon carving, towel arranging, sangria dished out and chefs making yummy fajitas, it was brilliant. The shows of a evening were really good, yeah they mime to the music most of the time, but hey this isn't Vegas! the costumes and dancing were absolutely amazing. We were there for the England World Cup game against USA and the chefs done us all a lovley BBQ outside the sportsbar, the staff had decked out the sports bar with england banners and flags, the atomosphere was superb, they really go the extra mile for you. Our kids loved crazy james, and Sergio, both of them cried their eyes out when it was time to come home. GENERAL TIPS: Take US dollars, we took mexico $ but everything is priced in us$, so was a bit of a pain. Loads of people were bitten to pieces by mosquitos, but none of us got bitten once! I was fully prepared, i took plug in's for the room, a can of Raid, and most importantly Boot's own brand of 50% deet repellent, wicked stuff! We also booked our swimming with Dolphins through Dolpins Discovery on-line in England before we went, they were very helpful and also gave us 15% discount, for my husband and 2 kids to do the swim adventure program cost \u00a3175, which is a brilliant price, it was lifetime experience for them, the highlight of the holiday. We also got a cab to a wildlife park near Cancun called Crococun, it was a fab day out, kids held snakes, parotts, and fed wild monkeys! You get your own private tour guide who was great, highly recommend this trip if you have kids. I would go back in heartbeat, if you have booked this hotel, you will have the best holiday ever, and i am very, very jealous! i am already looking to book again next yr, and this will be the first time we have returned to the same hotel, it really was that good :) any questions, please email me :)", "Date": "June 15, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Warrington, England", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful hotel and location, friendly, welcoming staff\u201d", "Author": "Sammyd159", "ReviewID": "UR67506772", "Content": "I have just returned today from one week at the Tequila where I stayed with my boyfriend and my 2 girls 4 and 7. I hope this is a balanced review as I read a lot of the reviews on here before I booked. The Tequila is beautiful, okay, it might not blow you away but unsless you are paying \"blow you away\" money then what can one expect!? The great thing I felt was the staff seemed to really love their work and want you to have a good stay, this really makes a difference. Rooms - Sorry but they are a bit small, there are two queen size beds not two doubles (thomson Holidays ought to be shot for their brochure description) it was fine for us as my girls are small and I am quite small, but a larger family would struggle in one room. Always cleaned though every day and the girls loved the towel creations! Food - The food was really good most of the time, the Steak House wins our vote for the best place to eat due to table service and quality of food as well as ambiance - even with two kids! The Asian restaurant serves good sushi but the other stuff is no better than I could make myself and they had an asian night in the main restaurant one night which served the same food. The Carribbean night though was brill, huge baked sea bass on the carvery. The only down side to the main restaurant was that when it got busy towards the end of our stay, the queues were really long and it was a bit like a school canteen, sit outside for peace and quiet is my tip. Entertainment - Every evening there is half an hour for the kids where they get up on the stage and they love this. The cabaret stuff is pretty good, I have to hand it to the staff. they work really hard and I think it's of a good standard, much better than I have seen on other resorts even if it is cheesy, it's good fun. I can't comment on the disco though as I had to take the kids home to bed before then :-( Kids Club - this is my only gripe I'm afraid. I don't know what went wrong our week, but the kids club is meant to run for 1 1/2 hours in the morning and again in the afternoon, Often the staff were late and then dropped the kids back early and just left the kids to find their own parents round the pool (I really don't like this especially after poor Madeline McCann, security is paramount for peace of mind for me) I also really wanted to know that I had some time to do my own thing and actually due to the unpredicatability of the kids club I could only stay on my sun lounger. I have a couple of otehr issues as well but will spare you the details Beach - Soooo Beautiful and the walk is fine, it's a lovely walk or you can catch the golf buggy there and back. All in all we had a lovely holiday, the staff are brill, when the England game was on Saturday lunch time, the staff put on a BBQ outside the sports bar for all the hungry supporters who weren't going to go to the other restaurant to eat! I thought this was a winner of an idea. I'm not sure I would go back to the Tequila, but purely because I want to go to so many other places and because the Kids Club did not meet my expectations. If you want comfort, cleanliness in lush green surroundings with a bit of a laugh and a friendly welcome then the Tequila will tick those boxes. 8/10", "Date": "June 14, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Powell River, Canada", "Title": "\u201cFabulous, well appointed and lovely accomodation and surrounding\u201d", "Author": "sunseeker2907", "ReviewID": "UR66915715", "Content": "Love this hotel, the staff are beyond friendly.

Check in was really easy. There was a table with envelopes on it with everybody's names on which contained our keys and towel cards. We were shown to our room by one of the staff and our cases were brought to us straight away. I had only been in the room a matter of minutes when reception rang to ask if the room was ok and was there anything that we needed. The hotel itself is really beautiful spotlessly clean and set in gorgeous jungle surroundings. The garden staff work extremely hard to keep things neat and tidy. I was a bit disappointed that I did not see any monkeys but I also did not see any spiders, snakes or scorpions either!! I did however see lots and lots of raccoons and other cute things that I can only describe as massive hamsters!! However they do not bother you but will feed from you if you offer it to them. The pools again are extremely clean and there was always someone on hand cleaning up. We always found a sunbed even though the hotel was very busy. The water is not cold either and I heard a few people mention that it was a bit too hot!! The entertainment staff are extremely nice and funny (especially Crazy James)!! I have never known staff work so hard. They start their day at 10am by the pool and do not finish until 10.30pm after the main show and even after they stick around to chat to people. I did find some of the entertainment a bif naff but they did try their best. The food was really tasty. I have been to many all inclusive restaurants and this has to be one of the best by far. The only thing I would comment on is that things get a bit repetitive at lunch time (burgers, pizzas etc.) but the meals of an evening were always something different. We did go to the Steakhouse which you have to book early in the morning and this was really nice and well worth a visit. Our room was kept spotlessly clean by our lovely cleaner (who was a man)!! Most days he would leave us an animal made out of towels which was a lovely surprise!! The beach is about a 5 minute walk away but there is a bus that runs all day but the walk is pleasant enough. The beach itself was absolutely stunning. There are watersports available and hundreds of sunbeds. You can also get your drinks for free at the Riu Yucatan. We also used their pool a lot which is smaller than the Tequila's. If you go to Mexico you MUST go to Coco Bongos nightclub. We went with Thomson to the one in Cancun but you have to leave at 1.30. We found out there was one 5 minutes away from the resort costing about \u00a33 in a taxi so we went there. It was absolutely fantastic. Take the time to go to Fifth Avenue in Playa del Carmen again about \u00a33 in a taxi. Its a massive shopping area with bars and entertainers - well worth a look.

We had a few tense times when we thought we wouldn't be able to go because of the volcanic ash but after a gruelling 12 hour journey we finally made it. When we'd landed we hadn't expected to have to wait over 11/2 hours at immigration which was horrendous but once we were on the coach things began to look up with beer and soft drinks served by the Thompson rep. Check in at the hotel was the easiest I've ever experienced, after drinking a nice non alcoholic cocktail we were given an envelope with our key and cards for beach towels and were shown to our rooms, our bags were delivered shortly after that. Rooms were very clean and contained two beds. These are described as 'doubles' in the Thomson brochure but are actually queen sized beds. This was a bit of a problem as my husband and I took one bed and our grandson the other, the following day we complained to the rep that the bed was too small and she had a single folding bed delivered to the room.....I feel this should have been done before our arrival but they were very accomodating. The rooms were extremely clean and the maids were lovely and hardworking, the only fault I could find was that they left the doors open when working in the room (this may be company policy to prevent theft) which let in a number of mosquitos. They have a mosquito screen on the patio doors which was great but we did have to kill loads of mosquitos evry day in the room. Make sure you take plenty of mosquito spray with you as loads of people werer badly bitten. Mini bar in the room was great plenty of spirits,beer and soft drinks which they topped up every 2 days but if you ran out you only needed to ring reception and they would send more. We loved the location, it's just a 500m walk to the beach and we could use the facilities of the Riu yucatan and Riu playacar which were located on the beach although we preferred our hotel to those two as it was less crowded and noisy. The food was quite good although we found the meat a bit tough most of the time and it became very repetitive but that isn't unusual in hotels. We didn't do the themed restaurants as our grandson doesn't eat a great variety of food so perhaps they were better than the main restaurant (the jalisco). There are two pools which were never too crowded and we managed to get sunbeds at any time of the day. The pool bar is great and the staff are brilliant the only problem was leaving it....every time you turned your back the drinks were refilled. The staff in the hotel are fabulous, the most pleasant I have ever met and we never felt threatened in the resort, everyone was very helpful. We were so active during the day that we didn't really sample the entertainment so I can't comment on that though lots of people said they enjoyed it. The animals around the hotel were so cute although some people with rooms backing on to the jungle thought there were rather too many coatimundis for their liking. We did several trips, first we went to Chichen Itza which took about 31/2 hours in the coach, we called in at a cenote on the way which was very beautiful but there wasn't too much time to enjoy it. Chichen Itza is amazing but be warned it is extremely hot, you definitely need a hat and some people took umbrellas (provided in your room) which was very wise for shade. The downside of Chichen Itza was the number of people selling souvenirs. Every shady spot had lines of tables set up with souvenirs on and stallholders pestering you to buy. Xcaret was lovely to visit with our grandson but it's really just a zoo and quite expensive at $99 each. We enjoyed our day there but wouldn't go again. It'll be great with young children but I wasn't too keen on the zoo set up. I don't like to see animals in captivity. Xel Ha was our favourite trip, We went once with Thompsons ($99 each all inclusive which includes all food, drinks and snorkel equipment) and then we went again on our own by taxi it cost slightly more that way ($79 all inclusive plus taxi fare of about $85 round trip). You have to enjoy snorkelling to like this trip as it's a lagoon full of fish. There are dolphins and manatees etc which you can swim with for an extra charge but we don't agree with them being kept in captivity for profit so didn't do it We snorkelled with a guide in Akumal bay and saw turtles and barrcuda, it's a beautiful bay but the best snorkelling is some way out on the reef and by the time I got there I was quite sea sick although my husband and grandson loved it. The food here was the best we had all week it was absolutely delicious! We visited Tulum by taxi it costs around $80 for the round trip and I thought it was more beautiful than Chichen itza in a glorious seaside setting and there weren't any souvenir stalls. The entrance fee is 51 pesos ($5) and adults over 60 and children under 13 are free.

The food at the hotel was really good, even if your fussy there is always something to eat and there is loads of choice. The waiter service haha haha at the hotel is non existent unless you go to the bar by the sports bar and get served by Cruz or Nancy who are amazing, they never forget your drink and never let your drink run dry. Take lots of mozzie repelant with you as by the pool and in reception you get eaten alive, I had 14 bites on one leg in a single afternoon by the pool, after that we went to the beach every day, much better option. You can go to the sports bar if your peckish and grab a snack but believe me you would have to be starving to eat the food as it was rank!!!! We choose this hotel because it was within walking distance to Playa Del Carmen and we walked there a few nights and had a really good time at the bars, I did get a bit annoyed at times by some of the younger people in the town asking if we wanted to get 'high' , at 40 years of age I was amazed and flabberghasted that I looked like I need something to get me 'high'. I would never stay at this hotel again as I prefer something a little bigger to walk round and have more choice as to where I eat and drink, but I think if you've got small children and you don't want to get out and about it's probably a good choice.", "Date": "May 23, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Plymouth, England", "Title": "\u201cTequila Sunrise\u201d", "Author": "Fozlove", "ReviewID": "UR65051181", "Content": "I have just returned from a fantastic 2 week stay at the Riu Tequila in Playacar. What a great hotel from the minute we arrived we were met with a welcome cocktail and our room keys, checkin was the easiest i have ever experienced. The hotel is immaculate and the staff cannot do enough for you, they are always smiling. The bar staff are the best i have seen at an all inclusive hotel, they have a laugh and a joke with you and your glass is never empty, the hardest part is leaving the bar! The rooms are all within the tree's so dont expect the best of views but they are comfortable and the Riu optics and freshly stocked beer fridge means you can have a nice relaxing drink on your balcony. The pool is excellent you are kept entertained on one side by the ever hardworking entertainment team and on the other side by Julio and the other swim up bar boys (stay away from the flying ice cubes and the cold water jets that come your way. Food was very good, fantastic choice at the buffet, if you cant find something you like then i doubt you will ever be satisfied anywhere you go! we ate in all the speciality restaurants and didnt have to get up too early to book, aroung 8.30 we were still able to get a seat. The steakhouse is the best, i was a bit disappointed with the mexican food, the view is stunning though. This is a lovely safe resort, it is well worth going out in the evening to playa del carmen, try the roof top bars for stunning views and ice cold corona's. The thomson reps were very helpfull and always friendly say hello to the 2 Ricki's and Wendy, get your restaurant and bar recomendations from them. The trips are ok but overpriced which has been mentioned before, thomson markup for you! but you have to go to Coco Bongo's in cancun and for a truley awsome experience the dolphin trainer for life, what a day well worth the money.

If you are planning a visit, take fly spray for the mosquito's with you as you can purchase it from the shops there but it is \u00a35.00 a can and it didnt seem as good as the sprays we have in england. secondly and most important we booked two trips with thomson, one was the fat cat lobster trip which we really enjoyed but everyone on the boat felt a little mislead as we were expecting a lobster salad and burgers (as per the Thomsons information) however you had the option of one burger in a bun or one bun with mayonnaise salad and tiny bits of lobster in it. Not particularly good and I was even left hungry and I am not a big eater. There was however plenty of beer, rum punch and pop and no limit to how much you had. When you get off the boat you can purchase a photo of yourself which was taken on the boat, however these cost $15 each or approx \u00a310.00 My main gripe which I feel everyone should know is the swimming with dolphins trip. This is truly a once in a lifetime experience and whilst it is expensive - we did the\"trainer for life\" program at $199 or \u00a3150.00 each (sold to us by Thomsons) and you get to swim with rays, dolphins, sea lions and manatees. We were told by the rep that this price included photos, dvd, tee shirt and a certificate, however after your day swimming you are shown the footage of your swims and then are escorted to the shop where you are told that photos are $20.00 each and the dvds are $50.00 each and as they have put the 5 or 6 minute footage of you with the dolphins on one dvd and you with the manatees and sea lion on another (again 5 or 6 minutes long) you are expected to pay $100 for the two dvd's. You are given a t-shirt each and a certificate but only one photo per couple even though you have paid a price per person. We were told that if a group of 10 people book even they would get only one photo as there are ten people on it!!!! but if you are on your own you would get a photo with just you on it. Unashamedly, taking the xxxx, RIP OFF. I feel so sorry for people with children who have done this swim as you really want the photos and the dvd's of your children having such a good time, but it is a blatant rip off and I am surprised and disappointed that the Thomson reps mis sell this. Having spoken to the rep when we got back to the hotel, he wasn't particularly interested as he had had his commison from the sale and would only say that charging so much for the photos and dvd was how the dolphin company made their money. My tip would be if any of you are planning to do this swim, then take someone with you to take your own photo's, even purchase one of those cheap underwater throw away camera's and take them yourself otherwise you will be extremely disappointed and worse still have a much lighter wallet when you have finished.", "Date": "May 19, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hemel Hempstead", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Tequila\u201d", "Author": "Tangmere_8", "ReviewID": "UR64726967", "Content": "We went with another couple and all loved the Riu Tequila and would recommend it. The staff are all very friendly and will even teach a bit of Spanish. Cannot understand the Butlins in the sun comments but there were people there that wanted McDonalds so bear in mind they may have written reviews. Rooms Cleaned daily and are spotless. There is a safe, iron/ironing board, TV and mini bar (even optics) which are all free. The mini bar is replenished every time something goes i.e a beer. All rooms have a ceiling fan and air conditioning. Pool There are two both are very clean and one has a swim up bar serving anything from beer to cocktails. The staff are always smiling or laughing, Julio is funny in particular. Never had trouble getting a sun bed as you are not allowed to reserve them, a note is put on if you do and they may even remove towels. Restaurants Main - is buffet style and the only problem you will have is what do you want to eat as there is so much variety. You cannot wear vest type tops but shorts are allowed as long as they are smart and not pool side. Drinks are served by a waiter. The Mexican section is really good. Steak house - this is on the all inclusive, we had an excellent rib eye there and as it was my wife's birthday we had champagne which was very drinkable and only \u00a312 a bottle. All other drinks are included. This is also a lunch time buffet restaurant too which is also full of variety. Asian - never went there but others said it was good. Mexican - is situated at another hotel and I must say was dissapointing, the main restaurant was better for Mexican food. There were not many other diners there which was telling. Not really worth the 10 minute walk. Bars There are three bars - Kiosk which is near the lounge and is open air, again serving anything from beer to cocktails. Here you will find Veronica whom is very encouraging on the cocktail front, she is very friendly and gave us all a laugh, Victor is funny too. Sports Bar - inside and air conditioned. Not sure if they do cocktails probably spirits and beers. It also has burgers and hot dogs you can microwave and some sandwiches. Third bar is next to the stage and is open air... never went there but I think it served similar to the kiosk. Entertainment There is a different show on every night and all look very professional... I don't know how they do it. There is a kiddies show on earlier which is also good and gets them to participate. During the day by the pool the team also offer activities like shooting, boules, dancing water polo to name a few but they don't hassle you. Trips We went on two with Thomson - Chichen Itza by air is excellent, you can go by coach which takes 3 hours. We went from a local flying club 5 mins drive from the hotel, in a Cessna. It took 30 mins to get there and we had our own guide Julian who brought the place to life he was excellent. You arrive before the crowds and eat before them too. A trip here is a must. Coco Bongos - another good trip, you go to three bars first. The first bar was a bit ropey and it would be better scrapped in favour of more time in coco bongos. The other two are good the last one being Carlos and Charlies. The Coco Bogo show is brilliant, definately recommend this trip. These are just two there are so many others and so much to do. Out and About Go to 5th Avenue 500 pesos \u00a33 by cab and approx 5 mins. There are a range of shops, Bars and Restaurants. We did go to Carlos and Charlies here although good very expensive 2 pints of beer and 2 cocktails was \u00a326... nearly choked on me pint. Local shops and cash points are 5 mins walk from the hotel, just turn left. Diving (not part of the hotel) We used Scuba Caribe which was on the beach, not good news if you have your own gear. We dragged two 22k dive bags across over 100mtrs of beach. If you go on a trip you are collected from the hotel which means collecting your gear... we did this three times and no one offers to help. However the Cenotes are an excellent dive as was a local wreck and Cozumel. Cozumel is a 30 min ferry trip so take a travel tab as we all felt queezy but are used to dive boats. We loved our holiday and all the staff at Riu Tequila do their best to make your stay a good one.

This is our first vacation in Mexico. We stayed at RIU TEQUILA. Everything exceed our expectation and we had a wonderful and memorable trip. The RIU TEQUILLA, YUCATAN, PLAYACAR are among the same resort complex. If you book RIU TEQUILLA you can use other hotel's facility. They all use the same bracelet. In my opinion The TEQUILLA is the best, YUCATAN second, PLAYACAR is the smallest. Environment: The RIU Tequila is like a huge garden. There is some walking required inside the hotel. The pool area is very beautiful surrounded by plants and trees and divided in two sides by a central steak restaurant Lupita. Water bar in the pool with underwater stool really make your day relax. Beach is across the road and there is a dedicated path to the ocean about 12 minutes walk from room. You can hop on a shuttle cart if you want. Staff: They always smiles and greet you with 'HOLA'. Most staff speak fluent English like managers, bartenders, coaches, and waiters. The gardener, bellboys, room maid, janitors, they don\u2019t understand English well. They all work really hard and devoted to make your vacation enjoyable. Tip is not required but always appreciated. 1 dollar at a time is good enough if you are well served by someone. there is a small card after the maid clean your room, you can put your tip inside that card. Food: The main buffet is excellent. They have a lot of variety. Men must wear a shirt with sleeve in dinner, swimming trunk is not allowed. Sandals and slippers are ok though. Ladies can be more casual. There is no limit on A la Carte restaurants you can go every night as long as you make your reservation 7am-8am that morning. They are more formal than buffet dinner and are really strict about you being on time. These A la Carte restaurant usually has two time slots, 6:45 or 8:45. Asian is the best, Steak house second, Mexican is so-so. When all guests arrived, they close the door. Lupita is most formal. They don\u2019t want you to leave seat and will bring everything you need. You can have breakfast and Lunch in RIU Yucatan or Playacar. Room: Really clean and tidy. They make the bedding everyday and change your towel every two days. But if you throw you towel at floor they will change it daily. A different towel animal everyday. They keep your 4 huge bottles of purified water. you can drink all the beverage in the small fridge. a small bar that has some of Vodka, tequila, rum, you can drink as much as you can. They will refill in 2 days. Ice machine outside the room. Air conditioning is really cold. Activity: Each night there is a different show on the stage. The best one is the Michael Jackson show. The actor mimics Michael really well. Most of the shows are good. The small square is always packed when show starts. A small bar by the square. people have drinks during the show. If you arrive late first night you can go to the 24 hour sport bar to have some snack and fresh fruit. day there are a lot of hotel activity you can participate. They are all like a small class. each class is taught by a staff coach. Air gun shooting, ping pong, dancing, water polo, Scuba diving, beach volleball and more. If you are the best in that class, they will present you a certificate during the night show. Wildlife: there are a lot of Coatis (like a long tail sharp face raccoon.) inside the hotel garden. They generally come out at night. There are lizards, small snakes, colorful birds, kind of genie pigs, hotel cats. Staffs not encourage feeding these animals but if they spot you they won\u2019t blame you. Some crazy birds will grab food leftover in lunch bars and are very annoying. Transportation: Taxi is always available at the hotel parking lot. To 5th ave is 50 pesos about 4 minutes. or 5 dollars. My opinion peso is a little cheaper than using US$. To Xcaret or Xplor is 12 dollars takes about 13 minutes one way. You can take a ferry to the Cozumel Island in 5th ave for 22 dollars round trip. Taxi drivers are very reasonable they don\u2019t overcharge you. You don\u2019t need to tip taxi. If you going out for a tour not including lunch, you can always grab some snacks in the sport bar and take them with you.", "Date": "May 16, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Nottingham", "Title": "\u201cLovely relaxed holiday, fantastic beach and friendly service\u201d", "Author": "scanny77", "ReviewID": "UR64119175", "Content": "My husband and I stayed for a week at the Riu Tequila and had a lovely time.

Guests of the Tequila have the use of the facilities at the Yuctan and the Playacar hotels so there is no need to worry about taking drinks/food etc. I would have no problems in returning to the Tequila and highlight my views; Check-in; if travelling with Thomsons the keys and All Inclusive wristband are ready for immeadiate collection and you complete the reqistration form and take it back to the reception later that day/next morning, this process is welcoming if you have had what appears to be the 'traditional' long customs process at Cancun airport... just be wary though it can take the bell-boy a while to get the bags to the rooms so you may wish to drag them there yourself Service at Bar was very quick even at busy times. Drinks; the choice was excellent ( includes branded named spirits) though the lager was dissappointing and not help by plastic beakers. Food; this was very good quality and a good choice, we stayed for 10 nights and did not find it over repetative. The 'ala Carte' Restaurants require booking in the morning - 1st come first served - but were nothing special and to be honest if you cant book them the food was generally available as a buffet choice during the course of the stay. Pool; We found this a bit murky and not over appealling; the one at the Playacar we felt was much better and brighter. Tipping; we felt absoluty no pressure to tip and the staff were not looking for it; if you have been to Eygpt you will notice the difference; if you do want to tip you can. Rooms; we found these very good. A massive positiive is that the air-con and ceiling fan stayed on all day so you could come back to a cool room. Rooms were cleaned to a good standard daily. A choice of Spirits in the room are provided plus a fridge which was stocked with beer, 7-up and other similar drinks. Driking water was also provided. The Evening (stage) enteraintment was good though it finished promptly at 22.30 which in my opion is a little early; the hotel has a disco from 23:00 to 0200. Reception area; this was pleasant and a good meeting point however as it is open (ie not air-conditioned) it does get hot . Mossies; generally not too bad, though they can be a problem at the poolside restaurant , so take repellant and spray your arms/legs before the evening trips (will come in useful as well if you visit Chichen Itza and a Cenote. Not hotel specific but useful info; Shopping - the hotel shop is small and limited, a couple of minutes walk away is a small parade of shops or take a 30min walk ( 5 US dollar taxi) to 5th Avenue - bigger choice. Trips: Thomsons trip (and other reps in hotel) to Chichen/Cenote is circa 100 US dollars, similar in a 14 seater aircon minibus from the nearby shops is 55US dollars (we went on this -no problems).

The hotel - was always clean and tidy - we stayed in a suite and our room was wonderful. Standard rooms do not have baths only showers and our daughter doesn't like to shower so if you have young children then the suites are a better choice. The staff - the hotel staff are great; they were always cleaning the rooms; the steps outside the rooms; the paths; the poolside; the place was spotless. They made a big fuss of our daughter and did everything they could to make it easier for us. The entertainment staff - worked so hard managing the activities during the day; they are not pushy if you don't want to join in. They put on wonderful 'cheesy' shows in the evening. Our daughter loved the mini disco and games and also the Mexican party night. The food - we always found something we liked to eat. Obviously, you are not going to get your traditional english food but that is not what I look for when I visit another country. Breakfast had everything you could want from freshly cooked pancakes, omelettes, every type of egg you could think of, sausage and bacon (not your traditional english) breads, cereals, muffins, fruit, yoghurt; sausage; bacon, hams and cheeses etc Lunch - pizzas, hotdogs and burgers mainly - there was always pasta and the salads are very good became repetitive very quickly Dinner - you could choose from 3 restaurants. The main restaurant was buffet style and there was always plenty of choice and the food was always fresh. Our daughter did not struggle to find something she liked to eat. The other 2 are specialty and had to be booked. The Asian restaurant was very good especially the sushi we visited 4 times. The Lupita is a steak restaurant and this was equally good although the pudding was not to our taste. This restaurant has a set menu but you could request something different for your children if you wanted or special side orders for yourself. Overall for an all inclusive hotel I thought the food was great. Pool - great pool, good cocktails. The beach - fantastic beach and sea is lovely. Trips - we only did the dolphin trip and the captain hook trip this time - the dolphin trip was great and the captain hook trip would have been brilliant if we didn't have our daughter (it was basically a booze cruise). We were told however, that it would be suitable for all ages but in hindsight we should have guessed so bear that in mind if you have young children as space is limited on these boats and when all the adults get dancing it was a scary place for our daughter. We always book with the locals it is cheaper that way and you get the same. Improvements - the buffet could get crowded and there were queues for food sometimes so not always a stress free experience when you get rude people pushing in but that is not the hotels fault. You could only have wine, beer or soft drinks in the restaurants. The wine's not great. The spanish students didn't really bother us - they sometimes took over the pool bar and was noisy at times but the pool and it surrounding area was plenty big enough to keep away if you didn't want to join their party. They were on holiday too and they did no harm. Overall - great value for what you get - cleanliness, good food, great pool and beach, plenty to do (lots of trips), brilliant kids club, great entertainment. Another good thing about this hotel is that you can try out the Riu Yucatan and Riu Playacar both within a few minutes walk. Both of these hotels are on the beach.", "Date": "May 12, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Altrincham, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Place\u201d", "Author": "villaslats", "ReviewID": "UR63934086", "Content": "Yes the Tequilla may not be a 5 star hotel but Thomson do rate it as a 4 star in their brochure which is about right.

The staff are so friendly as are the Mayan people who are from this region. For an all inclusive resort the food is great, with lots of choices includin Italian, Chinese, Mexican in the main buffet area. Only problem was there was too much choice. Catering for approx 1000 people or more is alot harder than cooking in a local restaurant at home. How anyone can say a bad word about this place to me is unbelievable and believe me I am as picky as the next person. The Thomsons reps were fab even though tired with all the mither of the ash cloud causing disruption but they still always had a smile on their faces. Wendy was great at recommending a local restaurant which was beautiful. We had a problem with the air con and within 10 mins someone was there to sort it out. ALL I CAN SAY IS A BIG THANK YOU TO ALL THE STAFF AND REPS FOR A GREAT HOLIDAY AND WISH YOU ALL THE BEST FOR THE FUTURE.

This is a beautiful hotel and the grounds were very well kept. The staff work very hard and are constantly cleaning. We booked through RIU.com and upon arrival at the airport, we were greeted by name. It took 45 minutes from airport. Check in was smooth and English was preferred over our broken Spanish. The buffet dinner and breakfast was great, alot of selection. We ate at the Steakhouse and it was so-so. The steaks are more rib eyes and flank steaks, so no filets here. Lunch buffet was very average with hot dogs and burgers each day, but not bad. We did eat at RIU Playa car for lunch and it was exactly the same. The birds were sneaking in and eating right from the buffet plates. Gross. We took an 1/2 day excurion through Blue Caribe and snorkelled with turtles in Akumal Bay. We also saw eel rays and a Baracuda. The reef was also very nice. We then went to Hidden Waters Cenote (same trip) and this was wonderful. The water was great and crystal clear. Highly reccomend this. We also visited Tulum. While very nice, it takes a while to get there and back, but also worth it. We ate in downtown Playa Del carmen one night and this was fun. The cab rides were exactly $5. Overall this is a great resort, you get a mini bar in your room and we never had an issue with having enough drinks. The walk to the beach is not bad, but beware, the shuttle does not run between 1 and 3, which is when it's the hottest. Never had a problem with chairs either. A few negatives: 1. The animals on the resort are nice, but they have cats. Some of them got into the steakhouse and were annoying. People fed them and then they meowed for a while. 2. They say you can use any RIU resort, but RIU palace would not let us get drinks at the beach bar or eat lunch there. Kind of a tease. 3. Mosquitos were around the hotel and surrounding area, not much you can do about that. 4. Didn't see too many people tipping. I guess since they say it's included, most people didn't bother. We were sure to tip frequently and got faster service.

Maybe a little more refined but would have to research that to say for definite! The Tequila was excellent but at night I would have prefered a bit more of a relaxing atmosphere, maybe I'm getting old (hell I'm only 35 :( ). The bar areas at night at the Tequila got very loud and busy with only a small bar serving everyone. They did an excellent job and always remembered what you were drinking, especially Patricia and Gerado at the Kiosk bar. I would happily pay a bit more for at seat waiter service since usually after a hard day on excursions etc all I need is to rest my feet and let someone bring me my drinks! God that sounds snobby doesn't it! Anyhow I'll give this some research when I return next time. The last point I would make is that it is usually cheaper to buy things in Mexican Pesos with cash, I took American dollars but brought most of them back. If you're offered anything in American $ and then ask to pay with credit card they only convert it to Mexican Pesos anyway so watch that because they all use different exchange rates, when I was there it varied from 12-14 peso to 1 $. All in all I thoroughly enjoyed my holiday and as usual don't go if you don't expect things to be different eg weather/climate/food/wildlife, we travelled over 5000miles to get there so things are going to be different, if you want home comforts then simply stay at home eh? :):):):) I didn't want to smply repeat everything already said so please do email me with any questions and I will answer them to the best of my experience, for your reference we did the following trips: Tulum - Mayan Ruins 8/10...much closer that Chitzen Itza Xel Ha - ecological park inc snorkling/diving etc + conservation zoo and night show 10/10 Xcaret Plus - ecological park inc snorkling/diving and AI food and drink 8/10 Mayan Encounter inc Zip Line - Cenote swim/canoe/abseiling/zip line/mayan village 9/10 These were all booked before I went and not with Thomson who provided my holiday.

Since this was only my first visit to Playa del Carmen and second visit to Mexico, I didn't have a whole lot to compare it to. Our stay was from April 25 to May 3 (9 nights). CHECK-IN We checked in at around 6pm and it was very quick. We were welcomed with two glasses of juice and had our bags brought to the room. The bellboy stood there expecting a tip which was a bit awkward but we didn't care too much. ROOM The room we had was about a 4 minute walk to the lobby. We didn't mind too much. The beds were two double (?) beds pushed together. The first night, I felt itchy on one of the beds so I ended up sleeping on the other. I'm not picky in terms of comfort so I had no complains about the mattresses. All in all, the cleaning staff did a great job cleaning our room. We always got towel animals whether we left a tip or not. We usually tipped a couple dollars every day except for maybe 2 days. The only thing was there were tiny bugs running around the sink all the time. When I left my bathing suit to dry on the counter one night, the next morning I shook it in the sink and 5 bugs fell out. I doubt there's anything that can be done though so I didn't care too much. The mini fridge was restocked once every 2 days. There are workers who come around to stock them so they don't actually get stocked when your room is cleaned. FOOD/DRINKS I'm not a picky eater. I can normally eat anything. But I found the selection, though plentiful, to be not fitting for my tastes. I ended up eating pasta/pizza every day. The fresh fruit was alright. Both my boyfriend and I didn't have pleasant trips to the bathroom each day. I don't usually mind. I'm a sucker for late night cravings and unfortunately the only place to get food was the Sports Bar which was a bit far from our room and only had the day's leftover pizza and hotdogs with microwaves to heat them up. I would say the food was just OK. The drinks were pretty good. I stuck with Blue Ocean most of the trip. POOL We never went in the pool. It looked like by 7:30-8 the good seats were all 'reserved' with beach towels. There are signs up all around that prohibit reserving seats but I doubt they made a difference. We only spent maybe 5 hours the entire trip by the pool since we were at the beach more often. There were always entertainment staff trying to get you to do activities. I did beach volleyball one day which was fun. ENTERTAINMENT I went in not expecting much and the performances were fine. I'm actually quite amazed that the entertainment staff go from working all day around the pool to run activities, to running night games (Vegas Night, Mexican Games Night), to doing 30-45 minute night shows. We made friends with Joshua, who we met when he was the dealer for Texas Holdem on Vegas Night. I would give the workers a 5/5 as they were always cheerful, friendly and wanted everyone to have fun. BEACH The beach was a 5 minute walk down a walkway from Riu Tequila. The first day we went to the beach, we walked (laziness didn't set in yet). The beach is gorgeous. The next few times we went to the beach we took the golf cart like vehicle down. It was so convenience because we had to wait no longer than 5 minutes for it to come and most of the time it came instantaneously. We had no problems getting the same spot (in front of the lifeguard close to the water). There were women tanning topless everyday. I guess I didn't mind but I would have enjoyed being able to look around without having to see topless women every time I looked. There was one day when we went to the beach near the end of our trip and the wind was so strong that the sand that was blowing actually hurt. We didn't stay. PLAYA DEL CARMEN We went downtown 3 times ($5 cab ride one way or 20 minute walk if you know where you're going!). The first time we went in and an English speaking tour company worker started talking to us. He was extremely nice (Oscar Rafael, near the main walkway down to the pier where the small fountain is?) and spoke to us about the different activities to do. We were weary especially since we knew about tour companies ripping off tourists and all the horror stories to go with it. They offer a price about $20-30 less than the tour companies at the hotel. We actually ended up booking Xcaret with them for $101 each. They actually tried to charge us more thinking we wouldn't notice but we told them that was the price that was offered. Xcaret admission is $99 but we got hotel transportation with it so we saved maybe $20. All in all, I would NOT recommend getting tours from any company downtown - they want money and don't care if they can trick you. They're also not accountable if anything happens. Since Xcaret is really just a large outdoor park/zoo/beach, we weren't too worried purchasing this from them. If you're looking to do something else though, purchase it at the hotel!!!! OVERALL The weather was very random. When we arrived in the evening, there were thunderstorms. It was mostly a mix of cloud and sun. The day we went to Xcaret, it rained for 2 hours. We didn't mind because it almost is better than being in the scorching heat. Personally, I don't like the inconsistent whether which is why I enjoy Puerto Vallarta more than Playa del Carmen. Also, bring bug repellent! I brought some but one night we had a reservation at Lupita (steakhouse requiring reservations at night) and didn't know it was going to be outdoor. We got destroyed by mosquitos and it was really disappointing. I even left half way during the entree to get the bug spray. My boyfriend got 15 bites on one foot. Other than that, we don't have any recommendations for activities because our 2nd activity (catamaran to Isla Mujeres) got cancelled twice so we only went to Xcaret. Wifi was free in the lobby and we used it to check NHL playoff scores! One last thing, the staff was excellent. They were always cleaning and you would hardly ever return to a table without your finished plate removed for you.

Went there with another couple for our friend's birthday and from the time we boarded the shuttle at around 11PM our party had begun. Check in was quick and easy & a late night snack waiting for us at the room. Room was VERY clean and spacious. The liquor dispenser and stocked mini bar was an added bonus,however did not drink in our rooms because service was so good at the bars we perferred sitting in the loby or at the bar with a cold one... Breakfast was outstanding, lots to pick from every morning. Lunch was good, ate off the resort 3 days, missed lunch all together another day due to intoxication but the other days found a great variety to chose from. Dinner was always good. Getting up early to make reservations was not a problem for our party of 4 because we are all early risers. While the boys went to book reservations the gals got freshened up to take on the day. Done the steak house one night and was a little disappointed. Food was fine but I have a major fear of cats and there they were wandering around the steak house waiting for someone to drop a scrap of food. I spent the whole meal looking over my shoulder or should I say under my feet. Just as we had finished our meal my watch had come on hooked and dropped off my arm and fell to the floor, the GD cat must have thought it was food and came chasing after me... Needless to say we did not return to the steak house. No Big Deal.. The asian resturant was awesome as well as the buffet dining room. Found we were never hungry after eating dinner so did not go to the sports bar for late night snacks but apparently there was lots to be gotten. Lots of wildlife to see and before I went to the Tequila I read some of the reviews on here and looked at pics. I have to admit I was a little freaked out. Once I got there and realized that they really don't bother you, I was okay. I actually got used to them and by the end of our trip I was snapping pics of them myself The pools were great and the swim up bar was a hoot. Julio and Maria are da best especially to the birthday girl..LOL.. Only one word to describe the beach...AMAZING... White sand, turquise water and cold drinks, what more could you ask for. Walkway to the beach was so relaxing and they say it is 10 or so minutes. Definitely didn't seem like that. Parasailing was out of this world and we took advantage of the free water activities also. There was no trouble getting kayaks or boogie boards at any time. We done Xplore one of the days we were there and a lil tip is to buy the package for $99 US and go on your own. Take your own taxi to and from for about $15 US each way and then you can come and go as you please. The ziplining is great but tires you out so you can just jump in a taxi and head back to your hotel when you are ready as opposed to having to wait for a group to finish. They offer you an all inclusive day package and it was well worth the money. Fifth Avenue was fun, felt very safe there and done lots of shopping. Remember to check any silver for a govt. stamp before buying. We got ripped off on a chain. Oh well No Big Deal... Mexican blankets are everywhere. If you plan to buy any tequila, be sure to buy before Sunday. Can't buy alcohol after 2pm on a Sunday. Senior Frogs was a blast.. Nightly entertainment at the resort was only ok. The staff works very hard at what they do but I was expecting a little more. No Big Deal...

They have Grease shows, Michael Jackson are to name just a few. Well worth watching. If you want a taxi into Playa Del Carmen it is just $5, there are loads of shops there and it isan't far away.

I must say we were very pleased. The hotel is very clean and the staff(for the most part) are excellent. Some outstanding bartenders and waiters as well. We asked for and received a quiet room in Block 22. A bit of a walk to the dining room and lobby but no hardship. The halls are noisy tile and you do hear some noise that echoes into your room but you can not hear next door or the floor above. The shower always had hot water and great pressure and we were missing a towel one time and when the front desk was called we had the towel and extras within 5 minutes. We loved watching all the animals from our balcony. The coatimundis are so cute. I called the other little creatures giant guinea pigs but finally found out they are Zereques. The free in room safe was great as well as the mini bar frig and regular sized bottles of rum-tequila- vodka and gin. Our room was always cleaned no later than 100pm and that was the latest time. There is also a clock and sateliite TV although we just turned it on to see what channels there were( we didnt have time for TV!) The food was excellent. I had read quite a few complaints in other posts about lunch..So here is what was available on any given day: salads-from the salad bar with fruit as well hamburgers hotdogs french fries chicken but sometimes fish or steak or pork a stew of some kind-sometimes chicken sometimes beef vegetables pizza soup and desserts. breads and cold meats and cheeses to make your own sandwiches. So what do these people eat for lunch at home??? We found lots of variety at the buffet in the evening. We did go to the Steak a la carte and while my rib eye was fine my husband's sirloin was very tough and not good.

When they have finished with the \"regrowth\" of the some of the rows of palms on the beach there will be a lot more shade. We had no issues finding a chair or shade any day however The beach is beautiful BTW. It probably was a different matter at the pool however. We did a pool day one day and I saw quite a few \"saved\" chairs but we were early there so had no problem. The front desk personnel were fabulous. Any question we asked was answered. Almost every night there were local vendors with all kinds of souvenir type things to buy. You could also walk a few minutes to the left out of the entrance to a mini mall. there was a drug store here as well as other stores. Here are the few things we did have issues with: There are mosquitoes-I got bitten until I carried my Off with me at all times. This only happened the last 4 days when the humidity rose dramatically. Unfortunately some people didnt have any repellent and there was a dramatic decrease in the number of diners on the terrace.My husband did not get one bite. They did \"insect fog\" while we were there but only twice that I saw. It could have been done more because of all the recent rain they have had. I was nearly impaled by a falling palm frond. And they are heavier than you think.The palms at the beach do need some regular maintenance. A huge \"branch\" fell within inches of me.

Yes, mosquitos are a problem but not a hotel issue - the entire region is teeming with an abundance of wildlife so it becomes understandable why they do not spray to reduce the mosquito population. The hotel is not on the beach but has access through the Riu Yucatan across the street to a beautiful stretch of unending beach. The positives regarding the hotel: Great staff service especially if you tip them - they are very appreciative especially for those most vulnerable economically such as the maids. Entertainment team tries very hard to please and are very warm to everyone. We never got sick as the food is served hot and with some care although sometimes a bit boring - they could use more seafood and variety since, afterall, it is a coastal setting. Entertainment shows were consistent with offerings of other Riu or other all inclusives. The MIchael Jackson show highlights the week but was not as good as other MJ shows we have attended but perhaps that is just personal taste. Wonderful sports bar and disco. They don't just play Mexican music which was much appreciated. The negatives regarding the hotel: Check-in was difficult and of course we were tired from travelling as we requested a room change due to no A/C and a lizard in the room - so were also hot, a little freaked and irritated with the front desk. To compound the issue the main restaurants closed early even though we had arrived at 9:30 and refused our entry. All was smoothed over on the room issue once I offered my Riu club card number and a new room was finally provided to our satisfaction. Claudia and Milthon deserve compliments for their assistance. One of the couples at the hotel advised us they had been robbed of a camera and money left in their room. We would advise you to keep all valuables in the lockable safe provided in the room. The hotel has champagne but you have to pay $20 a bottle to get it and it is a hassle. One of the entertainers, \"Crazy James\", was kind enough to provide us with a cold bottle compliments of Riu which was much appreciated and we thank Riu and him for that gesture. Siteseeing and outings: They were all great - we especially enjoyed the ATV tour and snorkelling in the caves which you can book right outside the hotel to the left just at the gates. Chichen Itza was interesting, long and very touristy - you will be overrun by vendors trying to sell you stuff so beware. If we had to pick a Mayan ruin to go again to we would consider Tulum. The Playa del Carmen 5th avenue is very interesting for shops and restaurants. Beaches, watersports, snorkelling, scuba diving, etc are all fantastic in the region so you will not be disappointed. Special hello and good-bye to some of the friends we met at the hotel: Craig, Ri and little Ross, Ron and Daphne, Julie and special thanks to entertainers \"Crazy James\" and Aidan and many of the bar staff/restaurant staff (too many to name) for making our stay fun.

I'll let you know about the bits I recollect and apologise for lapses in memory. This was our first experience of an all inclusive holiday and boy would we recommend it. Basically, the equation is simple - the more you drink, the more you save. The room was fine, but my wife was a bit dissappointed with the balcony. She likes to stretch herself out in the evenings or for an afternoon siesta but found the space slighty cramped. Having optics in your room definately helped with getting the kids to bed, but left them with headaches in the morning. You can't win them all? The room was cleaned every day and the cleaners services were welcomed. The pool was lovely, although a bit warm at times. Not sure why? I wasn't a big drinker until this holiday but I found a few mid morning beers set me up for the day. The alcohol then continued, through lunch, afternoon and evenings. Unfortunately at some point between afternoon and evening my memory becomes vauge. Tequila is available in all drinks and I would definately recommend drinking this instead of the water. The Canadians were very loud although my daughters found them very attentive. My youngest daughter enjoyed a few sundowners back in the room with them. When I say them, I don't mean every Canadian as we were only there for 10 days. Met some lovely people and thank one family in particular for there enthusiasm in introducing me to the joys of cocktails, no matter what time of day it was. Guys, you kill me (or tried to - not sure which?) Although it's more fun without the kids, I'd recommend taking them so that at least they'll get you back to the room in one piece every night. They were tipped so it's not as if I was using cheap child labour. Definately going back again.

The service is out of this world at this resort & in Mexico in general. ( this was my 11 visit to this country!) The hotel staff is beyond friendly & helpful. Food is good and safe to eat at all venues. Yes, a bit of a drag to get up to sign up for a la carte, but it is a beautiful time of day! Take advantage of dawn on the beach...grab a coffee and stroll the beautiful beach or even just stroll down the street. (very safe to leave the resort...no one gets in to Playacar with identification...let alone the resort itself ) During our stay this time Spainards were celebrating graduation and pretty much took over the pool a day a few days. We also found them loud & overbearing & disruptive. But hey, they are young......weren't we all??! Annoyed yes, but did not complain to hotel. Not the hotels fault....but am confident they would have moved us from our high traffic room. Just a note: hallways carry an echo.....be it conversation or closing the door to the room...hey it's a structure thing...:) We again, had a fab time and found great value for our Canadian dollar!

The ride to the hotel was fine, check in was fine, when we got there our room was on the ground level and i asked if there were any second level available, and in about ten min they had changed us to a second floor room. No one asked to help us with our bags so it was kind of a long trek to our room and up the stair with no bell man. I saw them though. The room was clean and nice, the frige stocked but was not restocked one time while we were there. My husband would just ask for a few bottles of beer when we headed back to the room. The beach was nice and we usually used the Yucatan pool. All of the pools were very cold and i hardly saw anyone in them. I was dissappointed that there were no hot tubs, just whirlpools connected to the main pool. I was not impressed with the entertainment staff rubbing the shoulders of some girls sitting next to us at the Yucatan pool. Not very professional. And i HATED the people who put there towel out on chiars at 6 am to get a spot. This should be a warning there is not enough chairs for the size of hotel it is. There was never a problem getting a chair on the beach around 9-10 am. There was a great selection of food, but after a few days it did get old. Much is geared toward the european traveler. We loved the cook to order omlettes in the morning but get up early if you dont want to wait in a long line. We tried the mexican resturant one night and that was probably the biggest dissapoinment, there was really nothing mexican about it. The service was VERY slow, and the food not very good, i had garlic shrimp over rice. The bars were ok, i liked the blended drinks, my husband liked the mohitos. They were not strong at all, and the \"top shelf\" rum was bacardi. I called to the front desk to see if i could get bacardi for the room and they said it would be $40, why when you have already paid to be at an all inclusive would it be that much more for liquor that you can get at all the bars. The next day the people with the bottles of drinks were sitting around and i aked them if i would get a bottle of bacardi for the room, they said yes, i tipped them $5 and imagine that, a bottle of bacardi. But remember the room was never restockd so i was constantly going to get diet at the bar. And i did call twice to have it restocked. I wish i would have brought big size mugs for drinks. Those baby size glassed were awful. I know so people say that americans are rude, but i feel like i am a pretty easy going american that is friendly to everyone. I am not saying everyone was rude, but the majority of encounters with the people from other countries were not good. I found people to be very unfriendly and for example you ask them \"what they were drinking\" they just looked at you like what the hell are you talking to me for. There was a couple sitting next to us one night at dinner and they were from N. Carolina, and when they heard us talking they were so excited to meet some fellow Americans, and they had the same general opinion we did about other guests. The staff were all very friendly. Hola everytime they passed by. So overall a nice clean hotel, with good value. I had higher expectations from all the great reviews i read.

The receptionist was helpfull and appologized for the behavior of the young guests. He brought us up to our room, which was quite a walk. When we entered in the room we were pleasantly surprised by the stocked mini bar and full alcohol bar. They have large bottles hanging upside down, just like in a normal bar. The ice machine was a block away, so we needed to walk every day 60 meters to get there. The hotel itself is well maintained and the staff is overall very friendly. The thing for us was the \"All Inclusive\" feeling. This means that there are 3 \"specialities\" restaurants on the premises and 1 \"normal\" restaurant. To reserve a specialities restaurant you need to wake up at around 07.00 to reserve a table for that specific night. You make these reservations at the \"normal\" restaurant, which serves breakfast in the morning and other food at night and is located at the reception area. This means you need to wake up at around 07.00 to make sure you have a table at one of the specialities restaurant. If you don't wake up this early on your holiday you can be sure that by 09.00/09.30 all tables at the specialities restaurants are already gone. If you didn't made a reservation at one of the specialities restaurants, you always can eat at the \"normal\" restaurant without making a reservation. It works the same like on a cruise ship, they have an early and a late dinner shift at all specialities restaurants. For lunch you need to go to the pool or sea area. At the pool area the restaurant serves more or less everyday the same food, the same counts for the sea based restaurant. After a couple of days we really got enough of eating everyday the same kind of food, there fore we went quite often into town and we rented a car to discover other places, beaches and restaurants. The guest are mainly Americans, Brits and Germans and there is a high tattoo level among the guest, if you know what I mean ... Everyday the hotel's entertainment staff organize several \"games\" and activities for their guests. I don't want to judge this, but we are not into this kind of entertainment. At night you can drink at 2 bars, one at the pool side and one near the reception area. At the bar near the reception area there is also a stage were the entertainment staff organize every night a different show. If you need an internet connection, you need to bring or your own laptop and use the free WiFi connection at the reception area or you can go to the sports bar and pay to use a terminal. The sports bar is open 24 hours a day and offers sandwiches, hanburgers and hotdogs. To be honnest, this was our first and last \"All Inclusive\" hotel stay. Maybe there are much better and more luxury hotels offering this kind of services, but we rather go to a smaller place with a better crowd and visit everyday another restaurant in town or elsewhere. All in all this is absolutely not a bad place, but certainly not a 5 star hotel, more a 3 or 3 1/2 star hotel.", "Date": "April 25, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Worcestershire", "Title": "\u201cOutstanding Holiday & Wedding\u201d", "Author": "Louise_S_Baker", "ReviewID": "UR62399371", "Content": "We have just returned from 20 nights at the Riu Tequila (6more than planned with thanks to the Volcano). We were a large group (44 for one week, and 34 for the rest of the holiday) for our wedding. We have given a general overview below. OVERALL This is a fabulous hotel. We found nothing to complain about, all of our party from 7years old though to past 60 were catered for extremely well. We emailed the hotel before our arrival with our room selection, and they carried it out to the letter! Food, staff, location are great, don\u2019t worry about not being on the beach, is only a five minute walk down a shaded walkway, and you can use the Yucatan for drinks and lunch while you are down there. There are quite a few negative reviews from people who only spent a day or so here because of the Volcano disruption. I can only assume that their negative comments are more out of frustration, because they certainly do not sound like the hotel we stayed at for almost 3 weeks! HOTEL Immaculate at all times, the staff never stop cleaning. Well designed so that no rooms overlook the pool area. STAFF Very attentive and extremely hard working, we found that nothing was too much trouble, and without fail every member of staff you had eye contact with said hello and smiled genuinely. ROOMS Rooms have 2 x 4 foot beds. The rooms are very spacious with loads of storage space. There is a pretty good hair dryer, and ironing board and Iron in every room. There is also a safety deposit box. There is a shower, not a bath, which we heard a few people complaining about, although it certainly wasn\u2019t a problem for us. The minibar is well stocked. They don\u2019t provide diet drinks, but if you leave a note and a few dollars, they will make sure you have some. POOL There are 2 pools, either side of the pool restaurant. One side has the swim up bar and fewer children, the other is where they play games and do the aquafit. With the exception of the Spanish students (as mentioned in other reviews) we found the split worked quite well. The Spanish students were not there during the first week of our break which was Easter week, so it is work checking Spanish holiday times. BARS The bar staff are extremely fast and the cocktails are good. They do have premium spirits at all of the bars, but you have to ask for them by name, ie Gordons and Tonic, or smirnoff and coke. Providing you ask they have no problem with serving these though, unlike some other hotels we have experienced. FOOD We ate mainly in the buffet Restaurant. The quality of the food is extremely high. The staff are very good there too. It is worth checking all of the cook stations, and I am surprised that anyone can\u2019t find something they like! There is often a pasta station which means you can pick your ingredients, pasta type and sauce, this proved very popular with the teenagers in our group (I rather liked it too). The omelettes at breakfast are fabulous. We ate in the Steakhouse 3 times (once for our wedding meal). This is by far the best speciality restaurant, the Asian is worth a visit, but we only used this once in 3 weeks. ENTERTAINMENT Well, I guess it is fairly typical of large hotels. As long as you take it for what it is, the entertainment is not bad. We did also visit the Yucatan one evening, and the entertainment there is very similar. EXTRAS There is free WIFI in reception, one of the teenagers in our group had bought his laptop, and they certainly made use of this! Otherwise, there is internet access in the Sports Bar, the cost is US $3 for 15mins, but the best deal is US $8 for an hour, and you can log on and off as many times as you like over a one week period until your hour is used. They also have printing facilities which is 5 pesos per page. It rained for a couple of days while we were there, and the staff bought out the board games, and entertained the younger children by the stage. We thought they did a good job of trying to accommodate people in the poor weather. OUT AND ABOUT We booked all of the trips before we flew out, and got a much better deal. We booked based on reputation and price. We hired a catamaran for a day with Paradise Catamarans; they were fantastic. The owner (Alex) and the crew remembered that we had a wedding and 3 birthdays while we were there and went out of their way to help us celebrate. They were very good value and the catering was excellent. (www.paradisecatamarans.com) We booked trips to Xel-Ha (including swimming with dolphins), Tulum and Chichen Itza through the Solatino travel agency on 5th Avenue in Playa Del Carmen. The owners there are Mike Kummer and his wife Paola and we could not fault their prices or their professionalism. They were always prepared to go the extra mile for us and I cannot reccomend them highly enough. www.solatino.com WEDDING PACKAGE Although the wedding here are clearly big business, and a bit of a production line, we felt like we were the only wedding that they had to think about. I cannot fault the attention to detail, down to the hotel manager collecting the bride and bridesmaids and escorting us to the wedding location. Because of the size of our group we had to have the top package (caprice) at \u00a31800 (US $2555). We had to pay in pesos so worth checking the exchange rate. We got married on the beach, and the entire day was outstanding. The flowers were beautiful, the layout on the beach was ideal (slightly in the shade), and the layout for the meal at the Steakhouse was as good as anything you would ever get in the UK. Some people have said the hairdressers struggle to understand what you want, but I couldn\u2019t disagree more. They had lots of photos to give you ideas, I picked 3 and asked for a mixture, and that is exactly what I got. I also had a pedicure, which was perfect, so do not worry, they will make you feel special and do an excellent job! We ordered the smallest photo package (best way to negotiate a deal in our opinion), and ended up doing a deal for all of the photos at a fraction of the published price. We were very pleased with the quality, even though some of it felt cheesy when they were taking them. Feel free to ask for particular pictures, they are very accommodating.

Butlins with sunshine is absolutely correct for this Hotel (although Butlins would have better quality night time entertainment). We were also moved here from the Iberostar Tucan for the last two days of our 4 day volcano delay. Check in was a bit chaotic but there were a load of us turning up at short notice so probably not the Hotel's fault. The fabric of the buildings were in good order and the reception very attractive. The accomodation blocks were \"functional\" rather than pretty and the interior similar to that of a generic modern Motel. As we walked to our room we passed a group of entertainers, one of whom (a man) was wearing a skirt and frilly crop top which was supporting his water filled comedy breasts - indicative of the sophistication of the resort as we would find out. We dumped our bags and went to the pool for the afternoon. There are two small pools either side of a central restaurant. Music was pumped out of a PA system which was only drowned out by the next round of entertainment - something that combined swimming with chugging large amounts of beer? We decided to give this a miss after about 20 minutes or so and headed for the beach club. Now here you start to realise there are some structural issues with the RIU resort. There are two beach front \"value\" hotels and two beach front \"Palace\" hotels. There are also two hotels (Tequila being one) that have no beach front and share with the value hotels. This means that you have four hotels worth of guests sharing two fairly small areas and it is tough to see the sand between the beds. We decided to try the beach side pool area of the RIU Yucatan which is by the beach club. Here again there are two very small side by side pools with some quite nice beds around them. The outlook back over the beach is attractive. The pools here (as with the ones at the Tequila) suffer due to the number of people trying to use them. They have a constant film of oil on the top from all the sunscreen and the water was decidedly murky compared to the IB Tucan. This wasn't even fixed after the overnight chemical treatments. We decided to have a look at the pool that had a swim up bar and were very concerned to find that there was a thick yellow scum driven in to one corner by the bridge. Being generous I will assume that this may have been a mix of wind driven pollen and spilled drinks, but it looked for all the world that someone had thrown up in the pool. We sat by the second of the two pools (the one without the yellow scum) until gone 6 the first afternoon to avoid having to go back to the Tequila. We had a couple of sundowners and the barman was excellent managing the order of people arriving at all three sides of his bar without error. It is a petty however that the beer was warm and revolting. The rum came out of a Havana Club bottle and tasted fine. Whilst here we were treated to afternoon bingo which is called over the PA system so that non players get to listen as well (how nice to have some extra noise to help you relax). The Bingo caller seemed to be having the best time, laughing every time he got to say the number six in German, and if he called sixty six he virtually disintegrated in to hysterics. We returned to the Tequila to change for dinner and were treated to an early evening serenade from the swim up bar in the central pool area near our room. This consisted on a large number of people screaming the first two lines of \"Flower of Scotland\" at max volume followed by a smaller number of people mumbling some of the third line, everyone humming the fourth line and then deciding to repeat from the start - over and over and over........you get the idea. This cacophany was further aided by the fact that there were several other populations of swimmers/drinkers signing different songs as a contrasting harmony. The fact that the rooms have a set of optics in the bathroom that are equipped with 4 litres of various spirits for you to guzzle is probably indicative of how they expect people to spend their holidays here. I smiled when I noticed the sign saying that the booze would only be replenished every 2 days - do people really get through four litres of spirit between two people every 2 days? Does this not kill them? At dinner, and in the interest of balance, the food was fine. It was probably comparable in terms of quality to the IB Tucan although maybe not as much choice? The wine however was extraordinary. You don't expect high quality house wines in the caribbean but the vintage served in the Tequila was unbelievably bad. Firstly the red wine was served chilled (out of an ice bucket). Now I expect someone will explain that this is some local Mexican custom but the only chilled red wine I have ever come across before is Beaujolais Nouveau and this is chilled to cover up the fact that this generally tastes so awful. Well no amount of chilling was going to diguise the fact that the red wine at the Tequila was literally rancid. It was so close to vinegar that I must assume that it had actually gone off and the chill was trying to hide this? The other thing we noted is that the restaurant tables are about half the size of those in the Tucan and this enables you to be that much closer to the dense mass of humanity you share the space with! Now if all hotels were the same then the world would be boring and there is probably nothing that fundamentally wrong with this resort but it does provide a very different sort of holiday to the one we booked. We managed to book a fishing trip on our second day here direct with Captain Rick's and spent most of the day (including dinner at Gringo Dave's) at Puertop Aventuras to avoid having to be at the Tequila but we also know that some people who were transferred here liked it. So if you want to flex your tattooed bingo wings, whip out your dobber (the professional term for a bingo pen I believe) and evaporate in a haze of cheap tequila whilst standing cheek by jowl with the masses then this hotel is porabably for you.

There is a great choice and each night has a different theme such as Asian, Mexican and International. One of the higlights for us was the fantastic entertainment team - particularly James. There is always something to involve yourself in during the day - yoga, volleyball and pool games. Personally, we chose to be at the pool without the swim-up bar as that is where the pool-side entertainment took place, but the swim-up bar is excellent too, with immediate service and a great selection of weird and wonderful cocktails! The nightly entertainment show was superb, we never saw the same show twice in two weeks - highlights are the Crazy Show and Michael Jackson. The staff are outstanding dancers and performers - we were very impressed! ALL staff who worked at the hotel were polite, attentive and never stop working and aiming to make your holiday a great one - they always have a smile on their face.

The swim up bar was our favorite, and walking for a mile or more on the beautiful beach was a must-do. Be prepared for pleasant walks to the main dining room, pool and beach. If you don't mind a little walking, this place will suit you well. Excellent food, tons of selection and everything fresh and washed with purified water. Skip the \"reservation\" dinner and just enjoy the dining room. Our hotel room was well stocked with bottled water, soda, beer and liquor. Rooms were immaculate, bed was comfy, great shower. Balcony overlooked gorgeous palm trees and secluded area, with interesting wildlife and dynamite sunsets. Be sure to request a room overlooking the \"back\" side and not facing the pool or other rooms for more solitude. HONEST STAFF! We left our ROOM SAFE OPEN one day, containing our passports, all our money, cell phones, identification, wallets, expensive camera! Realized and returned to the made up room, found the maid had called security and locked up the safe with all our valuables in tact.

It was a little less crowded than years past because of the H1N1 virus scare. The hotel employees are always very gracious and eager to please. As soon as you arrive at the hotel to check-in, they have a cocktail waiting for you ;) The rooms are very clean and the hotel was recently updated last year so the linens, etc. were new and in good condition. The only complaint we had was that the room was not very cool. We were not sure if this was because the hotel had been shut down 6 weeks prior to our stay due to the virus scare or because there was actually something wrong with the a/c. However, in the hotel's favor, they were very responsive and tried to remedy the situation. Other than that, we had no complaints whatsoever. The grounds are beautiful, we saw monkeys (not including our travel mates -- hehe), iguanas and other native wildlife. The food is great and they have a wide variety for whatever your tastes might be. In addition, they have a Mexican food restaurant, Chinese restaurant and a steak house in addition to the buffet but you must make a reservation for these restaurants. They also have a disco that is open until the wee hours of the morning that is a lot of fun and a good way to meet people. There is a sports bar that is open 24 hours and you can go there for a late night snack /drinks after the disco if you please. The best thing about staying at one of the Riu's in Playa is that you get to visit all the Riu's with the exception of the 2 Riu Palace's and enjoy all their amenities (pool, lunch buffet and of course, drinks -- non-alcoholic as well as alcoholic). We enjoy visiting the Riu Playacar because it is on the beach (and oh what a beach it is)! The Riu properties also offer shows at night such as Grease. The Riu staff are pretty notorious for getting crowd participation and interaction whether it be at the nightly shows or activities at the pool. Make sure that you bring a travel mug with you so that your drinks stay colder and you are not running back to the bar so often. There is a ferry that runs from Playa to Cozumel and if I remember correctly, it was around $22 per person round trip and about 45 minutes each way. It was a fun excursion. I hope that our review gives you some insight on making a vacation decision. ~ Your friends in Texas", "Date": "April 13, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Creighton Saskatchewan Canada", "Title": "\u201cRiu Tequila - Spectacular!\u201d", "Author": "moiraadavis", "ReviewID": "UR61043375", "Content": "This review is long and detailed . . . hope it is of some help to anyone considering a stay at the Riu Tequila! My friend and I stayed at the Riu Tequila from March 9th to 23rd via Sunquest out of Winnipeg on Sky Service. We had experienced a horrible trip to Punta Cana last March, and were more than a little wary about what to expect at the Riu Tequila and Playa Del Carmen. From start to finish, the Trip and Hotel were first rate! Our flight arrived early, and we were taken in a minibus with 2 other couples who were going to the Riu Resorts (so much better than being the last hotel off the Big Bus in Punta Cana!). We arrived at the Riu Tequila first, and even after completing the check in process, we were still early for the 3 p.m. check-in (2:45 p.m.), but luckily our room was ready. NOTE - Remember to ask for a 2nd room Key when you check in! It costs nothing (all you have to do is sign for it), and it makes a HUGE difference in the comings and goings of the Guests. Most complaints we heard from other Guests had to do with people going back to their rooms late at night, and banging on the door to be let in. A 2nd Key would AVOID that problem for EVERYONE - so please if you're planning on \"partying\", make sure you have a key to get in if your roomie has already gone back to your room to crash!! Common courtesy to fellow guests goes a long way here. We stayed in Bldg 25 - Room 2513. It is on the 2nd floor, located at the end of the building, facing the Golf Course. We had the benefit of having 2 open sides on our Balcony, which was very nice to watch the sunsets. Room 2513 was spacious and airy, with its high sloped ceilings. Our computerized safe held all of our valuables (including laptop) with room to spare. We tipped our Maid $2.00 US/day, plus small gifts (colouring pencils, lipgloss, maple candies, etc.). Our room was immaculate, and we loved all of our towel art (Swans, Hippo, Owl, etc.). We were very lucky to have such a quiet block, others were not as fortunate, both at the Tequila and Yucatan. There were lots of complaints of slamming doors, screaming, fighting, laughing in the hallways in the wee hours. In the 2nd week a bus load of local Teens rolled in and created quite a ruckus. One couple complained about a lack of response from the Main Desk and Security at 1:00 a.m., and they were promptly moved and upgraded to a suite for the remainder of their stay. We ate all of our breakfasts and suppers at the Jalisco restaurant off of the Main Lobby. We had the same Waiter for the 2 weeks (Nabor \u2013 awesome!), and ate all of our meals out on the Patio. Again, we tipped $2.00 US/meal, and received fabulous service. We enjoyed the different Theme Nights (International, Mexican, Italian, etc.) at the Supper Buffet, and had no problem finding something fresh and tasty to eat. Even in the 2nd week, there was enough variety that we didn\u2019t find much repetition, and were not bored by the choices. Midway through the 2nd week, we spoke with one of the Chefs (Genesis) who came around asking how we like the food. I mentioned that I thought there would have been more shrimp available, and the next night there were 2 huge copper cooking vessels filled with fresh Teriyaki Shrimp! We spoke with many who got up early to book the a la Cartes \u2013 and from what we gathered, it was pretty much hit and miss. One couple did the Steakhouse 3x in one week \u2013 their first trip was so-so, the second was awful, third time was magnificent. Due to the lack of consistency in meals and service, we chose to skip these restaurants altogether. We enjoyed the many nights of entertainment that was provided during supper service in the Main Lobby \u2013 Mayan Dancers, Mariachi Band, Crooner Singers, where we could sip a cocktail before entering the Jalisco. Our Bartender at the Maguey Bar off the Lobby was Felipe, who introduced me to Caiparinas and mixes a mean Paralyzer! I tipped him $1 every 2nd round, and he remembered my drink order each time, without any prompting. We watched most of the evening shows and the only repetition we saw in 2 weeks was Karaoke Night. I appreciated all the hard work the Dancers did in entertaining the diverse crowd. We saw Grease, Mamma Mia, Michael Jackson Tribute, The Crazy Show, Miss Riu, Las Vegas, Moulin Rouge, etc. Some have panned these in their reviews, but the shows are free, done on a limited budget, and frankly, if you wanted Vegas, you should have gone there and paid the big bucks for one of their shows instead! No one is forced to sit through either the kids pre-show at 8:30 p.m. or the main show at 9:30 p.m., it\u2019s an alternative to watching the cable television on your room. These young adults bust their chops at night, and then have to do all the day time entertainment (shuffleboard, salsa lessons, rifle range, bingo, etc.). It\u2019s a credit to their integrity to do this day in and day out, with a smile on their face, as they interact with many rude and boorish guests. Our first week it was Spring Break in Ontario, and there were tons of kids at the resort. It was surprising to see how parents let their kids run around unsupervised regardless of their age both in the resort and at the beach. It\u2019s not Disney World, and I thought more parents would have had watchful eyes and ears, showing more concern for their kids personal safety, especially given the strong undertow in the Ocean a couple of days in our first week. Lots of kids were left alone for extended periods of time. Some of the tween boys were truly obnoxious, and of course with no parents around, ran amuck. Again, the Animation Crew is to be commended for dealing with these ill-behaved children. We spent 2 days by the Pool, which was okay, but listening to the same one hit wonders from the 80\u2019s and techno rock, got really old really fast. We preferred the beach which is huge and beautiful. We never had an issue in finding a lounger, and just dragged them to where we wanted to sit. The ocean was lovely, warm, and we saw lots of white and silver Angel Fish being fed close to shore. In our second week, 3 additional rows of Palm Trees were planted, extending the shade area of the Riu Resorts. Several nights during our 2 week stay, Vendors set up in the Lobby and along the Walkway, selling and displaying their wares (woven bracelets, jewellery, spray paintings, clothing, wooden carvings, etc.). During our second week, the Resort filled up with German and French people, with a smattering of Brits, but still mainly Canadians. The number of school age kids diminished and were replaced with babies and toddlers. We did the 2 hour snorkelling through the Resort for $35 U.S. \u2013 well worth it! We swam with Sea Turtles, and hundreds of brightly coloured tropical fish. We also did Xplor for $99 US each and were entertained and fed from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. We bought our 30+ photos taken at Xplor on a Zip Drive for $49 US. The cab ride there was 120 pesos each way. We went to Wal-Mart in the first couple of days, and it had really cheap booze compared to what was available at the Playacar Village Shopping Mall across from the Rui Playacar. Wal-Mart also had the cheapest vanilla, and a decent selection of small souvenirs (shot glasses, t-shirts, etc.). Fifth Avenue shopping wasn\u2019t great, lots of poor quality clothing, and vendors calling out to you to go into their shops. Some were willing to deal, but many were not. Our best shopping was in the Riu Tequila Gift Shop (Mayan T-Shirts and Necklaces, Coffee, Hot Sauces), on the Beach (Silver Bracelets and Necklaces for $10 each), and in the Cancun Airport. In the 2 weeks we were there, I only saw one other person put a tip on the table, and that was a young family from Ottawa. We started handing our tips directly to Nabor, when one night a gentleman at an adjacent table \u201coffered\u201d to take our tip for himself and his son. I didn\u2019t see anyone tip the bartenders, and no one was \u201cshaking their hand\u201d when they picked up their drinks, so I\u2019m glad I did. There were many instances of drunken behavior at the resorts during our 2 week stay. At the Yucatan, there was a group of men from the US that we heard lots of complaints about \u2013 loud, noisy, rude, throwing up, etc. Often, near the bars, you could smell vomit, so it appeared that some Guests could not hold their liquor. One person said it was fermenting juice on the wood that adorns the bars, but I think some people used the trees and planters for puke buckets. It was pretty potent at the Maguey Bar on several evenings, where younger Guests were congregating and doing slamming shots Again, I have to say that we were extremely fortunate not to experience noisy guests in our block. Even the Golf Course was quiet, we only heard people talking on it twice in the 2 weeks we were there. I found the Riu Tequila Staff friendly and helpful. We had a couple of issues with our room (t.v. died, air conditioned zapped out), and once we called the Lobby, the problems were addressed within 10 minutes, fixed, and a follow up phone call made to our room, ensuring we were satisfied with the results. I believe all the Resorts experienced some form of noisy guests, given all the different people we spoke with. We heard complaints of noise at the Tequila, the Playacar, and the Yucatan. Looks like it\u2019s the luck of the draw, as to whether or not you had a quiet room. Someone was always cleaning, working, keeping the Resort pristine. Loved the wildlife, and the jungle like setting, which did loads to contain the noise levels from the Pool area.

Hotel, room and grounds were spotlessly clean. There was a choice of four restaurants - the main buffet one, and three that seated a limited number which you booked on a first come basis at the start of the day - Asian, Mexican (based at the neighbouring Yukatan hotel by the beach) and Steak. Buffet lunch was at the Steak restaurant that was between the two pools. Food at the evening buffet restaurant great - good choice; at lunch time less choice. I would rate very good + but not exceptional - but excellent for the price. Staff very friendly, and daytime entertainment team organised fun activities such as pool volleyball .. which you could join in if you wanted. Rooms consist of two small double beds - too small if you normally sleep in a kingsize and if your kids thrash about at night! However we asked for a single bed to be added and that helped. Bar staff attentive and the children loved the non-alcoholic cocktails. Sun-beds ... is there any solution that works? There were signs saying don't resevre, and management did walk round putting sheets of paper under towels of perpetrators saying you can't reserve. On one occassion I did see a follow up walk round carefully folding towels and posessions thus freeing up the beds - but it didn't seem 100% enforced and most people ignored it. We certainly saw reserved beds that weren't used until 3pm. Having said that at 8:30am there were many beds free, perhaps just not the ones you want. Overall less of a problem than other hotels we have been in and management were helping. Beach is a 5-10min walk across the road and through the Yukatan hotel, or wait and get the golf buggy. Beach is beautiful and there are plenty of sunloungers. Overall we all had a fantastic time. Can't comment on evening entertainment after 9pm - our kids always so tired they were begging to go to bed by then, so we took advantage of an early night.

My husband and I had stayed at a Sandals Resort last year and loved it. We were overall disappointed with the Riu Tequila (and Riu's in general since we could go to other Riu locations in the area). We loved the bar staff. They were super attentive and our drinks were strong and delicious. Our room was clean and overall pretty comfortable, however it was very noisy. We could hear every noise that people made in the hall, which made for poor sleeping in the morning. I had to sleep with ear plugs in and my husband slept with pillows over his ears. The pool area was nice but way too crowded. We spent most of our time at the Riu Yucatan across the way. It was much nicer because it was off the beach (beautiful view of the ocean) and the pool area wasn't as crowded because people could go seat out on the beach. We could always find a seat on the beach but we could rarely find a seat at the pool area (in either the Riu Tequila or Yucatan) since everyone reserved them in the morning and never went back to their seats (although this was against the rules but never enforced). The food was horrible! I am not a food snob but it was boring and repetitive and not very tasty. It was all buffet style. They had two restaurants you could make reservations at (which were also just buffet style) but if you didn't get up between 7 and 8AM you couldn't sign up for the restaurants and there was no other way to get in, even if they weren't full. We kept being told to talk to the manager at the restaurant but they just told us they were full for the night. We managed to make a reservation at Bamboo one night (the sushi was good) and there were so many open seats but they still turned people away because they didn't have a reservation. It was ridiculous. The Riu staff was not friendly or helpful. They did the minimum and nothing beyond that. The customer is \"never\" right seemed to be the motto at the Riu Tequila. The Riu did not cater to 30 year-olds without kids. It wasn't really couple or family oriented and actually tended to cater to teenagers. There wasn't really anything to do in the evening. At 9am they would have a show (none of which were very interesting) and then after 10pm you go to the sports bar or disco, which were both filled with 18 year-olds getting smashed (who knows where the parents were). I felt old just being in either of those bars (and I'm 30). We will never return to a Riu.

Right from the 'speedy check-in' (most well-organised we have experienced) to the Welcome meeting with Wendy (Thomson rep) which was actually helpful and informative to the great food, cocktails, pool and beach areas-there is a wow factor here. You would be hard-pushed to complain about anything. Beds were extremely comfortable, pillows good- and if you have a problem- they want to help/change/add to make it right for you. We never tired of the food and found it difficult to tear ourselves away from the main restaurant to the speciality ones. we did go to the Asian restaurant and it was very good. The reception area is like a community meeting place- great for people watching-also for wi-fi (which is free and even has plugs by each settee for charging/working from mains). There is something for everyone- it was 'Spring-breakers' time (as we're from Scotland, this was new to us) and there were loads of young people but there's so much for them to do it didn't interfere or dominate -in fact no one group did. The hotel was very busy during our stay- but again- it can stand it- the staff work so hard. The place is immaculate- I counted 14 cleaners in the reception area one morning. You just don't hear the ritual 'moaning' that you get so much on holidays- folk find it hard to complain...I'm sure they still manage to do it but it is the absolute minority. We used the buggy to go to the beach but it was very lazy of us as it is a few minutes walk through a covered walkway. You have so much choice of where to eat during the day- and it IS 24 hours- the Sports Bar (not my thing but I can see how good it is if you're into that) has a fridge packed with fresh fruit, packs of sandwiches, hot dogs etc etc and a microwave...and a bar open 24 hours. I could go on...but happy to answer queries. A fantastic place.

The beach. Its terrific. Nice soft sand, very few rocks, plenty of seats, a steady breeze, turquoise waters, nice rolling waves, etc. 2. Pools. There are multiple pools and they are all very nice is poor bars, in the pool lounge chairs, etc. 3. Drinks. You don't have to walk far to find something to drink and that includes drinks supplied in your room too. 4. Food. You can get something to eat 24 hours a day. There's enough of a selection that everyone can find something they like and they change it up a little everyday. 5. Clean. Everything is clean and well kept. 6. Friendly. The staff are very friendly. 7. Close to downtown. The 5th ave area is a $5 (US) cab ride away and its a great place to visit at least once. There is also a small area of shops about a block down the road. It includes a Starbucks, convenience stores, jewelry stores, souvenir shops, etc. 8. Variety. If you stay at one Riu, you can use the facilities at the others. 9. Activities. From Volleyball to shows at night to dances, etc. there is always something to do. 10. Price. Its a great deal for the price at the Riu, especially the Riu Tequila. 10 Worst Things: 1. Distance from the airport. Its a solid hour from the airport. Its painfully long when you are tired from flying, customs, immigration, etc. or on the reverse side trying to get back to catch a flight. 2. Nothing tastes like home. From Catsup to the drinks to the water to the food, nothing tastes like it does at home. Its all a little unusual. Its fine, but just not what you are used to. 3. Gotta get up early. If you want the best seats at the pool or beach or if you want the prime time at the restaurants you have to get up early, like before 8:00am. 4. Stocking up. You get four beers in your room and a bunch of sodas and mixers. They restock that once every two days. Its easy to go through four beers and it stinks waiting for more. There's never a bar far away, but its nice to have it in the room sometimes. On the positive side, each room gets four full bottles of liquor. 5. Noise. You don't hear anything room to room, but when people close the doors to their rooms, they tend to slam and it echos throughout the hallways. It can wake you up late and early. Its also tough to grab a nap at the pool or beach as there is always some loud noise from the people to the birds. 6. Towels. At check in, you get a plastic card. You hand that in and get a beach towel. If you lose or forget the towel, you have to pay $22 (US) for a new card. I never lost one, but it was stressful... 7. Strength of drinks. If you don't specify that you want a \"double\" or \"triple\" when you ask for a drink, its weak. 8. Water. You get bottles of water in your room and there is a sign on the mirror indicating that you shouldn't drink water from the faucet. Its easy to forget that. Two bottles of water is hardly enough when you consider they only restock it once every two days. 9. Cigarettes/smoke. While smokers will love it, non-smokers won't. People can smoke almost anywhere. At the pool, at the beach, everywhere but the restaurants. You even find cigarette butts in the sand. 10. Tour company reps. Each tour company has a rep that is on site daily. They try hard to force you to listen to their sales pitch about a number of pricey excursions. If you're not interested, its hard to get them to stop bothering you. They will try to set appointments with you, they will call you, etc. If you want to book your transfer home, they will almost make it seem like they won't do that until you sit down with them. Just say no... All in all, the 10 best things far outweighed the 10 worst. I actually had a hard time coming up with 10 bad things. As a bonus item, the weather predicted rain half of the week, but it never rained. It was warm and sunny. Never a drop despite a forecast that showed a 60% chance of rain daily. Oh yeah, we did the zip lines at Xplor too. $100 (US) well spent. Great time. All in all, I recommend the Riu Tequila and would gladly return.

This is our second trip to the Tequila (we did 2 weeks in August 2009) and loved it just as much. I am a seasoned traveler and the Tequila offers it all: location, cleanliness, food quality, staff and great beach! Location: we traveled here again (the first time I have ever gone to the same resort twice) because of the location. In the evening you can walk in either direction out of the hotel and feel safe and secure. If you walk right out of the hotel you pass the golf course and private homes. If you walk left you can visit a small plaza (2 minutes away) or Playa Del Carmen (20 minutes away). We went for a walk every night after dinner and this is a big plus as we don't really enjoy the evening shows. Beach: We LOVE the beach, and although you are not beach front, you are a short walk away. We actually really enjoy the walk and the many critters you see along the way. You walk on a private path that is shaded with trees. If you catch the golf cart you can grab a ride. The beach was just restored and I can't believe the difference! You can walk all the way into Playa Del Carmen, passing the other hotels and homes along the way. There are TONS of lounge chairs. This is a very important feature when we travel as it is not relaxing waking up at dawn to run down and throw a towel on a chair. No matter what time you get to the beach there will always be chairs waiting for you. Rooms: are clean, clean, clean! There is a free safe deposit box in the room, iron, ironing board and hair dryer. There is also a mini bar and fridge that are restocked every other day (bottled water, pop and dos XX beer). The A/C worked great and we really enjoyed sitting out on the balcony, cold beer from the fridge in hand, watching the golf course and the wildlife go by. Food: Very Good. I am a picky eater and most nights I could fill a plate of food and not have visited all of the stations yet. Lunch could be better, but I also don't really have any suggestions how they can make it better. Lunch is busy and the kitchens are small...so they really do the best they can. There are always snacks out (ice cream, pop corn, nachos, fruit, etc) so no fear of going hungry. The sports bar is open 24 hours and have sandwiches, cold pizza, fruit salad, etc. in coolers that you can help yourself to. Buffet: Awesome! Tons of variety and different stations so you don\u2019t feel like you are standing in a line for too long. Most people don\u2019t realize that the left side of the dinner buffet is the same as the right and will stand in the often longer line on the right. A La Cartes: I have eaten at all of them many times and they are great! One thing the Riu Tequila could do is not have so much of the meal buffet style and let us order our apps and deserts. Bars: There are plenty of \"you serve\" or \"they serve\" bars throughout the property. Definitly have a mojito at the pool bar, a tequila popper at the reception bar, and some sort of bartender surprise at whatever bar you call \"home\" Tours: This is our third time to Mexico in the last year so we thought it was about time to visit Chichen Itza (approx 3 hour van ride 1 way). We booked through the guys set up at the kiosks outside of the small plaza next to the Riu Tequila. We paid $50/person and our trip included a cramped van, 20 minute stop at an old church, 3 hours at the ruins, lunch and 35 minutes at a cenote. You get what you pay for. The ruins were fabulous and the cenote amazing! However, the cramped van, lunch we both got sick off of and bilingual (mostly Spanish) tour was not great! I would highly recommend seeing Chichen Itza, maybe just not with this company. Although, in all fairness, they were reasonably priced and we did get all that was promised. If you want more space, totally English (or whatever your preferred language is) tour guide and a \u201csafer\u201d lunch, pay the extra. Overall: you can not go wrong with the Riu Tequila. This was our second visit in under a year and we are already looking ahead to our return this summer \uf04a", "Date": "March 30, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ottawa", "Title": "\u201cGreat vacation, beautiful resort.\u201d", "Author": "MarioVH", "ReviewID": "UR59877578", "Content": "My fianc\u00e9e and I were at the Tequila from the 19th-26th of March. The flight from Ottawa through Sunquest/Skyservice was efficient and uneventful with the bus transfer to the hotel extremely easy. Once we got there we were greeted by some of the hotel staff and received a welcome beverage while we waited for our rooms. It gave us the opportunity to explore the grounds a bit and get a drink from the bar before we were settled into our rooms. The check in was worth the wait when we got to our room. The AC worked great and the rooms are spacious with two double beds pushed together for a big King sized bed and a nice touch is the complimentary bar in the bathroom area with 4 different types of liqueur at your disposal. We had a nice screen door to the patio area and all in all didn't have any complaints with the room. The grounds are extremely well maintained. The people that work at the resort are constantly cleaning and picking up after the customers. The staff is very attentive and never let you go too long without getting you another drink once your glass has been emptied. The staff does appreciate the occasional tip here or there and we made a point to reward them because of the excellent service we received. Common courtesy goes a long way and a dollar here or there for great service seems like the right thing to do. The walk to the beach should you choose to do so is only about 5 minutes away from the hotel. A shuttle service runs constantly for people who would rather not walk but for us it was good exercise and a way to work off the food from breakfast, lunch and dinner. The beach grounds are very beautiful with no shortage of chairs. You can grab one under the palms for some shade or in the wide open if you are working on your tan. The food was great with good variety. The great thing about the hotel chain is that you have access to two other complexes for breakfast and lunch. It was nice to be able to check out the Riu Playacar and Yucutan for a change of pace. The specialty restaurants at the Tequila were very good. I would rate the Asian and Steak House as the best with ironically enough the Mexican being my least favourite. The buffet option at dinner is also very good with different theme nights like Caribbean or Italian. Even the most discriminate of tastes would find something to eat from the over abundant selection of foods. The night time entertainment was good. The Michael Jackson show was very cool and they have other themed type shows that serve as a change of pace during the week including some audience participation. The kids are even looked after with some early entertainment for them before the adult stuff starts. A night club called the Pi\u00f1ata is also at the resort which caters to a bit of a younger crowd for some late night dancing and a 24 hour sports bar for catching games on TV and internet access. A small shopping complex is only 5 minutes away by foot so for those wanting to pick up a souvenir or two it serves as a nice stopping point before the end of the trip. Sunquest also offered us a bunch of different excursion options for those inclined to get off the resort and do some different activities. All in all it was a great trip at a first class resort a definite recommendation from me to anyone thinking of making a trip down to Mexico.", "Date": "March 29, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ontario", "Title": "\u201cFantastic Resort, perfect for family vacation\u201d", "Author": "OntarioSamfish", "ReviewID": "UR59816760", "Content": "Wow, wow, wow! I cannot comprehend how anyone could have a bad time at this resort. Riu Tequila is listed as a 5 star resort which if people are unfamiliar with Mexican standards could be misleading. This is no Royal York. However, it is fantastic as far as Mexican all-inclusives go. Clean doesn't begin to describe it, staff are phenominal, amenities are great. Our vacation had a rocky start, had to leave the house at 3:15 am to catch a 6;15 flight, as you can imagine our 17 month old toddler did NOT react well to this. Between the wait at the airport, flight, wait getting through the Cancun airport (speed it up folks!) she was a mess. Add to that the fact that we arrived at the resort at about noon and couldn't check in to our room until 3:30 (Flight Centre will get an earful about this, a warning or pre-arrangement would have been nice) Everything after this point made up for it, though, and i'd go back in a heartbeat. The food was fantastic! I love food, and my expectations were exceeded by far. Buffets that feed mass amounts of people usually compromise on quality, but i didn't eat anything I didn't like. Lots of choices for the little one, too. I was sick while i was there (throat infection that came on just before trip) Doctor on sight had me fixed up in no time. Kiddie area entirely suitable for our daughter. She loved it. the crib made available to us was a little rickety, in hindsight I probably would have brought our pack n play, but she got used to it. If you're taking a child, try to find one of those long sleeve swimsuits for them. the sun is very strong, this cuts down on the battle of the sunblock. The only complaint I have has nothing to do with the resort. Some of the other guests were incredibly annoying with their whining. While we met some lovely people, there were others that seemed to relish complaining. While 90% of the guests had a smile or chat for our daughter, a few people gave us the side-eye I assume for bringing a toddler who had her toddler-esque moments. If you don't like kids, or can't understand why they don't behave 100% of the time, i have an easy solution: GO TO A RESORT WITHOUT KIDS!!!", "Date": "March 29, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "lancashire", "Title": "\u201cFantastic, the best!!\u201d", "Author": "missussippi", "ReviewID": "UR59760017", "Content": "From the minute we arrived it was first class service all the way.

The Riu refused to book us an additional night as our fight was extended by one night. . The Riu also refused to refund us for any of the nights we were unable to stay. I didn't expect a full refund but one night would have been a courtesy that most reputable hotels would have provided. I was suprised at the reception staffs lack of assistance and concern for our situation, in fact they told us that they don't give refunds to Expedia customers. It was as if we were substandard customers. We were also shocked to find that many of the other hotel guests had delayed arrivals as well, and that they had no difficulties recieving refunds and additional nights at the hotel. We are currently trying to deal with Expedia to resolve our issues with no success at present. The Riu was a lovely hotel with friendly staff. The beach is beautiful and the pools are clean and plentiful. The entertainment staff works very hard and provides lively shows nightly. The rooms are kept very clean and the maid staff is very attentive to requests.

Playa Del Carmen has certainly changed from the small fishing village atmosphere to more commercialized, but on the resort you feel like no one else is around you. The Beach has been redone and it is absolutely amazing. Alot of errosion had taken place after the hurricane but right now it is wide ,white, and full of shells and beautiful. The average age group would be in their late 20's to 50's. There is alot of walking and if you have any problems with mobility I would not recommend this resort. The beach is a 8-10 min walk along a beautiful path but for anyone with mobility or heart problems they would find it to much.

We travelled here with our 2 kids aged 8 and 10 and they loved it. Our 8 yr old loved the kids club and the 10 yr old came and went as some things he wanted to do and others not. Nemo who runs the kids club was high energy the did olympic games, amongst other things and the kids usually got prizes at the show at night as well as went on stage to dance with the kids club. Every night there was something to do at the resort with the shows-there was a Michael Jackson show and even though he was not my favoirte we really enjoyed it. The also had a Mexican game night where you could play mayan games and win RIU dollars then you would go to the RIU bank and cash in your $ for prizes on stage. I would recommend this night for all, it was fun for all ages. The food was very good, yes it is a buffet, but there is something for all. They even had vegetarian which I have not seen before. The asian restaurant was very good, the sushi very good. The steak house was okay, try the steak and shrimp it was the best. Did not eat at the Mexican one so cannot comment. Staff very helpful, we kept our room cool with the fan on so there would not be any noise so we asked for extra blankets and it was not problem. As others have commented this is the cleanest resort you will ever go to. We enjoyed the 6 minute walk to the beach, would be no different if you were at a huge resort and you were at the back-we never had any issues getting chairs at the beach there were plenty any time of day. And the beach was beautiful. lots of sand and lots to do.Getting chairs by the pool, you do need to get out there early. we usually went out by 8-9 am and had not issues. we went to Xcaret and really enjoyed it. We have on previous trips went to Xelha, Tulum, Chitzen Itza, snorkeling in puerto morelos and coba. I would recommend Xcaret to anyone but keep in mind there is a lot of walking. get the Xcaret plus as eating there is very pricey. also only get your admission and take a cab-it was 140 pesos each way then you can go and leave when you want. There is also a walmart in playa del carmen in case you need one. oh and last but not least if you do not care for the coffeee on the resort there is a starbucks a 2 minute walk away in the plaza on the street in front of the resort. Also in the plaza there are many shops a mini mart and a pharmacy. Go to the RIU tequila you will not be disappointed.

In all aspects, mediocrity was the norm. Many reviewers write the same thing over and over. I'm going to try to skip what you've already been told 200 times and try to concentrate on other things that I consider noteworthy. ROOMS: Rooms were excellent. We were very pleased with them. However, if you have trouble walking, have a foot problem, or have breathing problems, this may not be the place for you. It's a sprawling property so plenty of walking is involved, not even to mention the hike (about 1/2 mile) to the beach across the street. Our rooms (1903) were at the end of the property. The next day we requested something closer to everything. The front desk was very accommodating. They said they were full today but will make the change for us tomorrow. They gave us room 2505, which wasn't considerably closer to everything but enough for us to make the change considering the number of times you go to your room each day. FOOD: BUFFET: The frist day was good. The second repitious. The food was just \"okay.\" Yes, tons of choices, but many of them so similar. I thought the lunch and barbecue at the pool bar were better than the dinners. I thought the breakfast buffet was better than the dinner buffet. I do strongly recommend you try the specialty restaurants. It's no worse than the buffet and it breaks it up for you. Even more so, if you can, try dinner in and around the 5th Avenue area. Many great a fun places to explore. RESERVATION RESTAURANTS: We didn't book the Mexican restaurant primarily because it was at the Tequila and we had done enough walking at our own complex. Making reservations for the following 2 were very easy and you didn't have to be up at 6 am to make them. Both days we made the reservations after 8 am and had no problem. BAMBOO: (Asian, behind the main buffet area) Another buffet. What can I tell you? Our friends who are familiar with sushi were not impressed with theirs. They tried it but never had seconds. They said it was \"not that great.\" Other buffet items very typical. Nothing outstanding or noteworthy. LUPITA: (steak restaurant at pool area.) We ordered the rib eye because everyone else said how thin the sirloin was cut. The ri b eye wasn't much better. It was just okay. They called the dessert \"Baked Alaska.\" It certainly wasn't. It was a plain ice cream cake. POOL BAR: Probably the best area of the resort because of the bartenders. They were always fun and wonderful. Bartenders worth a mention: Julio (watch out for him! lol You'll see what I mean once you go there.), Noelia, Rossi, Marbis, Dalia, Feliciano. SPORTS BAR: Located behind the front desk, after the area where they do the shows, is where you can get coffee before breakfast is served. Went there the first morning at 6:30 to bring coffee back to the room. It's not self-service. You need to ask someone for it behind the bar. I had a thermos and 2 travel coffee mugs that I asked to be filled because of the distance it was from our room. The server did it, but looked at me like I was requesting too much. I left a tip as I do for everything I ask for. There was a table with pastries where you could helf yourself. You needed a magnifying glass to see the meat in the sandwiches that were available to you in the cooler. Did we have a good time? Yes. Was it a good value? Yes. Would I stay there again? No. Primarily because I like to be on the beach. But, like I said, it was a good value but it was overwhelmingly mediocre. Feel free to write me if you have any questions.

Went as a group of 28 friends and family, had a fantastic holiday and a perfect wedding. Was nervous at first dragging so many people so far across the world to come to our wedding, but soon after we arrived we realised that we had made a great choice in choosing this hotel!!! Everyone loved it. Check in was swift and easy, we were greeted with a cocktail and given our room key. We were then shown our way to our room and our luggage arrived shortly after. The staff are very friendly and are always working very very hard to keep the whole place clean and tidy. The entertainment staff work so hard also to keep you entertained but just the right level, they don't bug you to join in if you have said no. Bar staff are great and work hard to make sure your glass is always full. Tipping the staff from time to time is a good idea too, although they do their job very well and don\u2019t need tipping to encourage them to do their job but deserve tipping as they do such a god job. The 2 large swimming pools were great. There was the sports pool and the swim up bar pool. Both very clean, the pool guy was always scooping any fallen leaves out almost before they had even touched the water. The beach is a pleasant 5 min walk away and while you are there you can use both the Yacatan & Playacar's bars, buffets and pools (I think the Tequila has the edge on these 2 hotels). The beach is AMAZING! The sea is perfect, turquoise and just like the photos in the brochure. The food was great! Plenty of choice in the buffet if you wanted to be healthy or not so healthy. I think breakfast was my favourite meal of the day. If I could give any advice it would be to take Pesos. The American Dollar is accepted everywhere but you will get your change in pesos and that really didn\u2019t seem to work out very well in your favour. In my experience paying in pesos is the way to go. During our second week at the hotel it was spring break, for a quiet life I would advise to AVOID this time. The hotel got very busy and was full of young American and Canadians who were loud and mostly drunk. Our wedding was amazing. We chose to have the ceremony in the hotels grounds as this was much more private than weddings that we had seen taking place on the beach. Everything went perfectly to plan and I can\u2019t fault the wedding co-ordinator. If you want to know more just get in touch. We defiantly plan to go back to this hotel in the future!

Never did we wait for a drink or anything. WOW Ground: It was like a tropical garden. Very nice and well kept. There are nice wil life arround hotel. Even monkey near the beach club. Pool: Very nice and clean. I thought it was a bit cold. You also have access to 2 different Riu hotel for drink, pool, show.... Beach: The beach is fantastic. If you want less crowded , not that it is bad because there are a lot of places. you can walk on the beach for about 1 km south and there are very few people there. The sand everywhere on the beach is nice. The beach is clean. Water was not cold. No rock on the main beach. The beach was redone in January 2010. You have to walk for 5 min. to get to beach through a nice patch with colums and flower and trees, it is wonderfull. There is also a shuttle every 5/10 min. that goes back and forth to the beach. Room: clean, clean, clean Shows: Some very good other not as good. This is a matter of taste. One thing is the dancer / entertainnner are excellent and extremely talented. If you have kids, they entertain the kids for the 1st 30 to 45 min before the show. I found that long but if my kid would have been there, I would have been happy that they were entertainned. The food is good. After 2 week, I was due for change. A la carte: The steak a la carte, well, they use the lunch pool pavillon and because there are 2 sittings, they almost force feed you. They were rushing you. so much, it was not pleasent. We left before dessert. A la carte: Bamboo restaurent is oriental. Lot of sushi, it was okay and a good change. A la carte: Mexicain, they use the beach pavillon. I feel it is the same as lunch but with more diversity. Main restaurent: Lot of choice. Different stations. Could have more diversity.

The weather was cooler than expected, but no rain and no snow and warmer than London, Ontario! Flight: Smooth flight both ways. Note: we were approached by people at a counter in the Cancun airport that we thought we were supposed to talk to, but it turned out to be people trying to sell tours. It took about an hour to get to the hotel from the airport. Hotel first impression: Beautiful! Service: We were met in the lobby with a drink. Our keys, wrist band, towel cards and hotel information were waiting for us. Our luggage was quickly taken to our room. The hotel employees were very friendly. They called part way through the week to ensure that we were happy. Rooms: Large and clean with a well stocked fridge and bar! We were in a room at the back of the resort in an area referred to as the \u201cjungle\u201d. Our room smelled damp and the linens felt damp. It bothered my wife, so we moved to a room near the front of the resort and it was great! Food: Excellent! The buffet had many, many choices for breakfast and dinner. It had a different theme (e.g. Italian, Asian, BBQ) every night with food choices that went along with the theme. We also ate at the steak house and the Asian restaurant and they were great too. Lunches were at the pool and the beach. The selection was much more limited at lunch, but the food was still good. Entertainment: They had nightly shows that were better than ones we had seen at other resorts. They also had many scheduled activities for adults and children, such as exercise, yoga, dancing, volleyball, darts and Spanish lessons. Beach: Spectacular! White sand, blue water, lots of choices for chairs in the shade or sun and close to restaurant, bars and washrooms. It is about a 5 to 10 minute walk to the beach or you can get a ride. We liked the walk. Pools: 2 adult pools and a children\u2019s pool that were really nice. They had lots of chairs too. Shopping: We went shopping at the plaza next to the resort, which has lots of souvenir shops. It also has a Starbucks. We spent most of a day on 5th Ave in Playa Del Carmen, which has many shops, restaurants and bars We walked there, which took about a \u00bd hour and we walked back, which cost $5. The Sunquest agent told us about a silver factory called Lapis, so we went. It was much more expensive than we expected and they put a lot of pressure on you to buy something, but we didn\u2019t. Tours: We booked the Ek\u2019 Balam tour through Sunquest. We left at 7:25 a.m. and got back at 6:30 p.m. On the tour, we visited the town of Valladolid, went swimming in a cenote, had an excellent meal at an authentic Mayan restaurant and visited the ruins at Ek\u2019 Balam. If you plan to climb the steps at the ruins, I recommend wearing walking shoes, not flip flops as I did see one person trip. The only complaint about the tour was that the washrooms at the ruins were less than ideal. Overall, the tour was great and we learned a lot about the Mayan culture.

Pros: Food is amazing! There was a great selection at the buffet and all the restaurants. The desserts were great and the breakfast buffet was great every morning. The rooms were a little dated but they were kept clean and everything worked great. They were also huge..there was a ton of room to make yourself feel at home. The grounds are beautiful. We saw a ton of wild life and lavish plants and flowers. There were always workers cleaning and keeping it looking like paradise. The activities were great. We played basketball, darts, volley ball, shuffle board...etc. It was a lot of fun and even though we were HORRIBLE at these activities we had a ton of fun. The people are great and very helpful. My FAVORITE part of the resort location would have to be the mall nearby. We walked to the stores every morning (less than a 2 min walk) and looked at the local shops and talked to some locals. The nightly entertainment was the best I have ever been to. It was fun and they kept the audience involved. We loved the casino night. They taught me how to play BlackJack! The bars are great. Try the Blue Ocean! Cons: They don't serve cocktails during dinner. It didn't bug us because we would just grab a couple drinks from the bar before dinner. Also we got kind of sick of the lunch buffet. It was the only place to eat during lunch and it seemed somewhat similar every day. Lastly the two double beds pushed together got annoying.

This was our first experience at an all-inclusive and after reading plenty of reviews, I felt very prepared for what was in store. We arrived at 7pm and the hotel atmosphere was amazing. The lobby is open-air, there was music playing, it just felt like paradise immediately. They greeted us with guava juice and gave us all the basic information we needed, and showed us to our room. The rooms are great, perfect size, good air conditioning, nice view of the trees. They also have a safe in the room, which fits a 15\" laptop and plenty of other items, we never had an issue with security. The first morning we left a note and a tip for the maid asking in Spanish for more water and beer, to our surprise, they knocked on our door later that day and brought four more huge bottles of water and 6 more beers, and even asked us if we wanted more! The staff is really there to make your stay a good one, I never had one issue. One thing no one mentioned in past reviews was all the Riu Resorts in Mexico have a water purification system, which was a huge deal for us. Any ice or water you had at the bars or restaurants was perfectly safe, we drank it all week and never felt even slightly sick. The drinks served are slightly weak but one trick we learned was to either ask very nicely for a double and tip the bartender, or go back to the room and add a little more alcohol. Our room was very close to everything, so we would usually do that so we had a drink we could sip for quite some time. Another note is the restaurants only serve wine and beer, but you are completely allowed to bring in a cocktail from the bar. I would usually have a cosmo with finlandia cranberry(much better than well vodka) with dinner, which felt a little fancier :) Also try the Mexican Coffee, they catch it on fire! As far as the restaurants go, I think the buffet was best for all meals. Since we are early risers, we were able to make reservations at all three restaurants. The Asian restaurant was not good at all, and was actually a buffet. We think the reason they require reservations is to limit the amount of fish they must buy for sushi, since it is probably much more expensive than other buffet items. The Mexican restaurant down near the beach was ok, but again nothing spectacular. The steak house at the pool was our favorite out of the sit-down restaurants, we had the rib eye and the surf and turf skewers, which were both pretty tasty. They do a little dessert presentation of baked alaska at the end of dinner, which was fun to watch. The buffet was great for breakfast and dinner, there was always something yummy to try. The breakfast was probably my favorite, with eggs in every style, yogurt, cereal, fruit and fresh juice(try the banana milk, its good!). The dinner buffet was good, but definitely slightly generic most days. I really hoped for more authentic mexican food, but I suppose they are trying to please the masses. The desserts were great, including coconut ice cream and I always finished with a espresso from the machine, nice perk! When the weather was nice, there was always something to do! There are tennis courts in the front of the resort, which you can borrow rackets for at the check-in desk. They also have plenty of activities by the pool, which you can borrow the equipment from the entertainment group throughout the day. They are constantly having a tournament of some sort, which prizes were giving in the evenings to the winners. The shows were pretty dorky, we skipped them on most evenings. Since neither of us are the type to just lie around at the beach or pool all day, we were definitely ready to go home after our wonderful week. We planned two excursions through Thompson, Xplor and Tulum Extreme, both very recommended! This helped break up the week with more physical activity and getting away from the resort for a bit. If you like zip-lining and adventure, Xplor is a must! Well, sorry for the long-winded review but I hope this helped for those looking to visit Riu Tequila. My last comment is just always tip! The folks at the resort are working day and night to make sure your experience is flawless, please show your appreciation! We came with a huge bundle of 1s and made sure to use every last one while there. We tipped larger for a la carte dinners and fancier drinks, but tipped for everything including bar, buffet, daily maid service and our tour guides for excursions.

Antisocial behavior will leave you grumpy no matter where you go. I met plenty of them and all I could say is they were the nicest lot I've ever met. Friendly, polite and interesting. Don't be afraid to socialize with people, everyone's super friendly (hey, they're on vacation, right?). The staff was great, very cheerful and fun to be around. Food was really good for a resort, no complaints here. Though nothing extravagant. Night entertainment was also pretty good, though I preferred it after it ended because that's when anyone worth hanging out with stuck around. The people at the bar were really relaxed and you could tell everyone was enjoying themselves. The people BEHIND the bar were great, fast orders and big smiles. Try a Mexican Flag, its a crazy drink that you simply must have before leaving. The disco was alright, definitely not a contender with night clubs but hey, whatever. It's inclusive, right? Gym was at a nearby resort, 2 minute walk. Nothing special but good enough. Cuban cigars for sale, the vendors selling souvenirs at night have weed if your'e interested -- though I wouldn't recommend it. Hands in pockets = signal. Nine year old enjoyed it, especially the entertainment specials after dinner. Teenager loved it. Tips: Haggle with taxis, its easy and they're cheap as is--name your price before getting in. Don't buy any kind of tour/excursion in the hotel, go to 5th avenue, talk to the information booth that you see as soon as you get out of the cab. Much cheaper. Though don't go with anyone shady/unofficial. If they can't afford advertising, then yeah, they'll be cheaper (much cheaper--we went scuba diving at two locations, with full rentals for two adults for $160 american, but we didn't get any official lessons), just go at your own risk with these kinds of people and beware of lying.

The positives-It is a large resort, set in lush gardens. So clean and cared for. Most staff were very friendly. Good size pools and lots of sunbeds. Main restaurant loads of choice everynight but a bit like a canteen! Wild animals were adorable and i fed them everyday!!! They are used to being fed, and by the end of the holiday were on our balcony waiting!!!!! Don't usually have anything to do with the reps on holiday but needed to on this occasion and found them VERY helpful. Ricky and Wendy (but especially Ricky) were fabulous and not pushy!!!! (Ricky misses chicken and mushroom pot noodle and HP brown sauce if anyone can take any out!!). Formual 1 boat excursion and snorkelling was great fun, and swimming with the turtles in their natural environment not to be missed!!! Beach fantastic but sea really rough, but good fun trying to stay on two feet!!!! The negatives- weather quite cloudy most days, (but still really warm). Resort was full of lots of loud, brash canadians who spoilt the peace! There are 3 restaurants, two of which, steak and asian, you have to book for. Each morning at breakfast we would ask if we could make a reservation but everyday were told \"the steak restaurant was fully booked, there are many canadians staying here madam and they like steak. if you want to book you must be here before 7am\"! Astonishing! So, no limit on how many times you could eat there, and if you stood any chance of booking a table you needed to be there before 7am where the queue was already a mile long!!! I'm on holiday!!!!!! The asian restuarant was lovely and peaceful and calm, with excellent service!! Optics in the room, was a great idea but didn't do them justice!!!!

Excellent choice of restaurants on Avenida Quinta (5th Avenue) in Playa del Carmen - try Madre Tierra (on corner of 5th and 14th North) for a simply amazing steak.

Travelled with my Girlfriend and Mum and Dad, We stayed 10 nights and Mum and Dad did 14 nights. Arrived after a poor 10hr flight and 1hr coach journey and was welcomed with a nice cocktail. but the funny thing is, before I even finished it we were given the Key and told we were all checked in and followed the 2 men who pushed our bags to our Room. Room was fine! Heard people moaning about size and Dingyness but found it Comfortable with lovely shower and not being very light helped you sleep better! It was fantastic pouring a drink from the optics and sitting on the balcony! The Staff are the most hardworking I've come accross, constantly cleaning and attending the grounds and never failing to smile and say \"Hola\". We were very worried about the beach as It was shut for reconstruction before we came but was told on Arrival that it was brand new and found it to be fantastic with the Yucatun Restaurants and pool bar right by so you can have a nice lunch and cold beer and stroll back to your sun bed- DONT EAT ON BEACH OR YOU'LL BE ATTACKED BY SEAGULLS!!! There is plenty of sunbeds but the annoying thing was the old towell trick, my Mum and Dad used to get their beds under the Coconut tree's but a family of 8 used to put their towells on the beds next to them and not show up til 10.30-11:00 every morning so one day I put a coconut on one of the beds and when the bloke showed up he thought it had fallen from the tree so he moved with a look of horror on his face! The Restaurants are Fine, read in reviews that the buffet is the same most days/nights but I found that there is so much choice that you could have a different meal every night for 14nights if you wished- found the food and drink Great, didnt have 1 upset stomach at all! The only Complaint I could have is that to book the Steakhouse for the 7pm sitting you have to get up at 5.45-6am and queue up as it seemed that the same people were doing this every day and Maybe if you had kids you may find it difficult to do this this early. Didnt go by the pool much as I dont like being poolside but it looked nice. The weather was a bit chilly in the mornings and evenings but nice in the day and we got a cracking tan. got told the weather was a bit volatile because of the Bad snow accross America- Mum and Dad said their last few days turned very hot but as a tip take a cardigan just incase it does get a bit breezy so you can pop back to your room to put on of an evening. There was a few refreshing rain showers but there is an Umbrella in the room which is a nice touch. And dont worry about the short walk to the beach as there is loads of wildlife to see and I became obsessed by the Racoon things! One night we had a few in the Disco and I dropped my hot dog walking back to the room, before I knew it I was surrounded by about 30 of them- no joke!! all jumping up at my legs but they were no harm! The Bars are good, Entertainment Sometimes Good (When the audience participated we never knew what the hell was going on) The highlight is the kids show. If you get tired of the main Bar walk down to poolside Yucatun bar. The Town is a pleasant 20min walk and the restaurants/Bars wouldnt look out of place on the beach front of St Tropez- Sadly neither do the prices!! \u00a330 for 4 drinks in one bar!

There was really no such thing as sleeping in, which was supposed to be part of our vacation! Check in and check out was fast and easy. Exchanging money was easy, and the rooms were very clean and comfortable. My husband thought the bed was too hard, and I thought it strange that they placed two twin beds together to make one big bed....Good pillows, extra blankets, soft sheets...Best shower I've ever experienced in a hotel. Not sure if other rooms have bathtubs, ours didn't. Safe in the room is easy to use and secure. The drinks are weak, order doubles. You can smoke pretty much anywhere outdoors, so if you're a smoker it's nice for you. Didn't swim in the pool, it was too cold. Not to mention, people go to the pool at 7am, leave all their stuff sitting at a chair and table, and leave for 5 hours, so you think the seat is taken. I think it's rude, as we barely got to sit in a seat at the pool. (and the hotel asks you NOT to do this!) The beach was not as crowded as I thought after reading some of the other reviews. We kayaked, but that's it.....And take a bottle of water with you, as there are not many members of staff offering drinks at the beach. We sat for 4 hours and not once did the \"server\" ask if we wanted something. The dinner staff was about as helpful. It was rare that we got a drink before we were done eating! And at breakfast you can get your own drink. At dinner they say the waiter will bring it, but we waited forever!! (unless you want wine. they that around with them!) The buffet for breakfast is probably the best, the dinner buffet is lacking. Pizza and salad and bread are about all we ate consistently, as the other food was just not that great! Had fish on Ash Wed. and it was good, tasted like Lake Erie Perch to me! Desserts are pretty good, cheesecake at almost every meal! The little pool buffet is alright...if you're starving. The burgers are like American hospital burgers, so if you're in to that, you'll be fine! They had popcorn and nachos, but were out every single time we wanted some. The fruit was ripe and tasty as well. We didn't experience the \"reservation\" places, and we never got sick from the food either. But by day 3, we went in to town to eat because we were bored with the selections already. And the 24 hour sports bar offers cold sandwiches and fruit. Not anything wonderful. If you want to access the internet, but NOT take your laptop, you can purchase internet minutes at the sports bar. We paid $8 American for an hour of internet svc on their computer. Just enough to check in from time to time. They also have books in the lobby available on an honors system, which is nice if you read a lot. The Michael Jackson show was fun, and the other entertainment was pretty good. They had a karaoke night, but it was irritating because the same group of kids kept going up and singing over and over and over again...I didn't want to hear teenagers sing for my night time entertainment. We paid for a poolside massage...DO IT!!! I think it was $62 a person for a 50 minute swedish massage. It was one of the best things we did at the resort. We also took a taxi to 5th Ave. I'd highly recommend that. The desk will get you a cab, then just pay the driver $5 when he drops you off, they're happy with that. If you walk down the block to Plaza de Playa, you get ripped off. They don't bargain as much as they do on 5th Ave. Overall, good time. We did some outside excursions too that were fun.

I was very surprised by all of the negative reviews after my stay! Our rooms were great, we had 2 rooms on the lower level backing onto the golf course. It was really nice to sit out on the small patio in the morning or afternoon. Although you wouldn't want to leave the doors open all evening as you could hear the golfers in the morning. The rooms were Very clean, and the room cleaning was great! The entertainment...Too Long. You have to be out there to get a table early, as it does fill up early.

Bring cards or some type of game to help pass some time, and it's not such a long wait!!

And there's tons of shops and restaurants, or you can take the ferry over to Cozumel. We only spent one day at the pool, and the rest at the beach, but it was nice for the day. On the beach you can borrow boogie boards for an hour, or rent seadoo's ($60 for 2 people), or any other water activities.

It is probably the cleanest hotel that we have stayed in for along time, and there was always a member of staff cleaning something every minute of the day. The food is decent, given that it's buffett style, and the choices are changed most evenings. There are some other restaurants, namely Asian, Steak and Mexican. We only tried the Asian, and if truth be told it was very dissapointing (except for the Sushi), we spoke to people who had been to the steak restaurant, and didn't hear good reviews of this one either, so we decided to skip it. The pool is really very good, but was very cold, and the sunbeds get taken up quite quickly, so you need to get down there before 08:30 to claim your spot! The beach is good, now that they have finished \"rebuilding\" it (a Hurricane last year removed a lot of the beach). The beach is a five minute walk away, bit if you can't or won't walk there is a gold buggy type vehicle that takes you to and from the beach, this is runs every 5 or 10 minutes, so never long to wait. You can use the facilities of the Yucatan, Lupita and Playacar. We tried the Yucatan and the Playacar but didn't find them anywear near as good as the Tequila - so this made us quite happy. In fact, people would come over to the Tequila, from the other hotels, in the evening as the atmosphere seemed a little better. It's also worth going to \"Fifth Avenue\" in Playa del Carmen as well, you can walk it, but it will take around 20-25 minutes, a taxi is only $5 (or 50 peso) so you may as well get a taxi. There are loads of shops, bars and restaurants, and we ate out 3 times, twice at a place called \"La Parrilla\" which was food as good as I have ever had anywhere (Lobster ans Steak) If you are going to do trips, we did a couple that I can recommend, one was called \"Fat Cat\" which was a day out on a Catamarran, great fun and you got to snorkel over a great reef as well. I highly recommend the \"Fat Cat\". The other trip we did was to go to Chichen Itza, which was also excellent, but a long day - if you do book this, don't do it at the hotel, as they will charge USD $99, we found out (after we had booked) that if you walk out of the Tequila, and turn left to the little parade of shops they have there, you can book for around USD $50 - it's exactly the same trip, on the same coach etc. So save yourself some cash and book direct with the agents, not via your rep.

We stayed in this hotel for 2 weeks and we had a great time. We have stayed in Mexico before and knowing the area around the Riviera we decided to stay somewhere closer to Playa del Carmen and so we chose Playacar and the Riu Tequila was the perfect place. The hotel was very clean and the rooms were cleaned everyday with replenished towels also. The rooms have 2 double beds pushed together and although there really isnt much space in the rooms due to the large beds this was not a problem as we were out everyday. They even have optics in your room with brandy, rum, tequila and vodka if you fancied having your own party! There are 2 pools seperated by a snack bar, one side of which is the swim up bar. We had lots of fun and friendly banter with the barstaff who had super soakers filled with ice water and on one occasion they all ganged up a particular waiter and threw him in the pool, it was hilarious. We couldn't fault the staff, they were very welcoming and friendly throughout the hotel. There are 3 a la carte restaurants which you could eat in every evening providing you booked a reservation at the main buffet restaurant in the morning. There was an Asian, Mexican and Steak House. The Steak house was our favourite. Although the main buffet restaurant was really good, they have a large variety of choices and had themed nights on different evenings. We especially enjoyed the breakfast. The evening entertainment was fantastic. The entertainment team are really good performers and dancers and they work hard to put one hell of a show on. Each evening has a themed show and our favourite was the Michael Jackson show which was brilliant! Be sure to get there quite early as this area gets filled up pretty quick. The main show starts at 9.30pm and there is a kids and teens show beforehand. Oh and it can get a little chilly later on (if you haven't got a sunburn). The hotel is situated away from the beach which was a short 5 minutes walk away or you could jump on the buggy from the hotel lobby. The beach was fantastic, soft white sand, nice waters, plenty of water sports etc and we had no problems finding a sunlounger every time we went. The Yucatan snack bar was next to the beach and so we ate lunch in there and refreshments etc. Well situated within a 15 - 20 minute walk into Playa Del Carmen or a $5 / 50 pesos short taxi ride. We enjoyed going into Playa Del Carmen on a couple of days and a few evenings. From there we hopped onto the Ferry across to Cozumel which was around $12 and well worth the visit to this quaint island. We also ate out in Playa Del Carmen a couple of times and you can shop till you drop, make sure your ready to haggle at the non high street shops, its alot of fun. We visited Xscaret which was definitely worth the visit, especially for the spa treatments we had at Xspa which was underneath a cave in a cenote! It was amazing. We got a taxi there and back and paid at the entrance and I think this worked out cheaper and we could please ourselves with when we went or came back. Which is a must for us when we travel, we like to venture out and try things ourselves rather than being tied down to a schedule. I hope you find this review useful. I could be here forever writing more information, if you need anything else, get in touch.

Since the RIU chain does not accomadate 3 kids to one room I had to pay extra and book my older child into another room which costs large but we really wanted to TEQUILA so we paid the extra. I requested 2 ADJOINING ROOMS which we all know means two rooms with a door in the ROOM to get to the other room. NOT THE CASE HERE! They gave us two rooms next to each other with no adjoining door. Keep in mind I have 3 year old twins and this arangement does not work out well for me, Just imagine putting the kids in one room .. them needing something on the middle of the night and needing to bang on the walls or open there hotel room door to get to our door in the middle of the night. The hotel director SABRINA guaranteed us the \" adjoining room\" plus late 5pm checkout and we braught along the email that confirmed that. To make a long story short she put us up in a junior suite instead and told us she would not charge us the late checkout fee of #50 us if we signed a form saying we would not complain to anyone about this situation when we got home. My wife signed it and we began our vacation. Take note they were not doing us any favour giving us a suite .. I payed $1400 extra for another room for 1 person my 11 year old just because they dont take 3 kids to a one room. Our week vacation afterwards went great ... we loved the pool even though it was quite cold. The new beach was fabulous! The food was really good .. little repetive after a few days especially the LUPITA at lunch time. We tried the 3 alacartes and found the ASIAN was far the best of the 3! Animation staff bartenders and waiters were great. Then we went to check out they wanted to charge me $50 late check out even though SABRINA hotel director which was conveniently not to be reached promised us no late check out charge. My wife said we should have made her sign what she said instead of trusting her. Anyhow I refused to pay for it after arguing with them. What a way to end a nice vacation. Left us feeling very dissapointed with the hotels management. Here I am just spent $5000 and there crying over $50 they even promised us they would waive. We love the RIU TEQUILA but I'm thinking next year trying the RIU YUCATAN for a change and convenience, Better get on the reviews for that resort .. hope there just as good.

I was wowed by the place from the moment I arrived. Their method of checking us in was quick and efficient...unlike the last resort I visited in Cuba that made us wait in a long line up. I took the free introductory SCUBA lesson from Alex in the pool. I hadn't SCUBA dived in a couple of years and he suggested I do that before I went for a dive on the reef. He was excellent at explaining my options of the various dives available to me. I had checked out prices in town for dives along with the travel agent at Walmart. The agency in Walmart were pushing for my wife and I to visit a Mexican owned resort in town the following day and my dive would be half priced. I asked if this was some sort of time share he was trying to sell me and he got a bit offended. I didn't much for his attitude change at this point and he got a bit rude when I said we will think about. I had read a few other peoples comments saying it was cheaper to book your adventures through Walmart but I went with the resort for a matter of convenience and friendlier people. There was a short walk to the beach and they had a shuttle bus which ran back and forth for most of the day. The beach was under construction for last couple of days of our visit but they had a bus to shuttle us to another beach or we could use the beach at the resort up the street. The waves had been fairly extreme for a couple of days and the beach was taking a pounding and they were trying to improve it.

Here's one more. The hotel is clean, well worth the five stars. Buffet breakfast and dinners are superb with enough variety that you never have to eat the same thing - at least on a one week stay. Lunch buffet is also good. Beach is a short walk across the street between two other Riu properties. Drinks plentiful with friendly service. Nighttime entertainment restricted to a one hour formal show, preceded by a genuine effort to get the audience involved - sometimes hugely funny, others just lame. Rooms are in several small two storey buildings situated throughout beautifully maintained grounds - much nicer then a high rise. They have free wifi internet in a small area near the lobby - but it was down for two of the 7 days we were there. Even when working - it's very slow and unreliable. Lots of excursions can be arranged from the hotel - but beware - 45 minute rides can easily take two hours or more if you are going on a tour bus - they stop at a dozen or more hotels on the way to and from the attraction. Better to take a cab and cost is about the same - at least for Xel-ha, Tulum. Also be prepared for the 45 minute ride from the airport to take two hours or more - if you arrive after 10pm hungry, there is not much choice until breakfast the next morning.

Almost\u201d", "Author": "ChrisG98", "ReviewID": "UR55679728", "Content": "Being our second visit to the Riu Tequila we thought we knew what to expect! And we did with regard to the food being fantastic again- the service- wonderful (In fact a few of the server/bartenders will 'maybe' be the reason for our return again next year as there are some we just love! ) We personally do not care for the 'mega resorts' so the Tequila is wonderful in that it is tucked away in a gated community with many amenities -not to forget to mention Playa Del Carmen being a walk away.. You don't feel stuck. The downside of our vacation was that our travel time 1/24 thru to 1/31/2010 we had no NO BEACH access as we remembered due to the (necessary & we understand this) Restoration project underway SO sitting under the palm trees at the Yucatan Riu beach on the Caribbean did not happen for us- we saved $ & dreamed all year about this very important part of our vacation. We couldn't even sit for long to watch this undertaking on the beach as the diesel fumes from the heavy equipment spoiled the breezes. Disappointed to say the least that there was no notification of this prior to our arrival. Thus- the plan of resolution for travelers from the Tequila management was either a crowded pool - where you hope to get a lounger but only if you find one at 7 a.m. The options were the Riu Lupita Beach where shuttle service was provided or the public beach in town. Now mind you with several resorts under construction there were hundreds + of people in these other areas- CROWDED & not fun. Quite honestly this was a big 'Yuck\" for us. We are not complainers by nature- but it has left a bad taste in our mouths with the lack of acknowledgment beforehand. This was a planned project! So needless to say the spectacular review that I thought I would be writing has some negatives regarding customer service handling. As this is sounding like I should be writing the complaint department- I do want to give fair credit to the hotel for keeping up the standards with regard to the lovely grounds- the very clean rooms & another top priority for us the wonderful selection of food- I read the Tripadvisor reviews all the time before and after our trip & question how people can get bored with the food & buffet offerings - I scratch my head- There is lovely selection & superb! We have our favorite restaurants & in order they are the 'Mexican Cuisine (at the Yucatan) - the Steakhouse & last but not least the Bamboo. Sometimes I think people forget that this is not the Palace- and for the promotions that the Tequila offers for a weeks' stay you just cannot beat the prices for an affordable all-inclusive. We did not attend all of the shows- but the few that we did we enjoyed. These are talented performers! - a nice feature. As to whether we will go back- that is in question due to our personal circumstance. Know that the beach is now restored and expanded! So lucky for all of you visiting!

didnt wait too long for our cases then straight through the other side to board the coach, beware of anyone trying to assist you en route to your coach.. the journey to the tequila was an hour and 40 minutes, a lot of this was due to the heavy rainfall making the journey slower. arriving at the tequila was such a sight for sore eyes after all that travelling, the lobby is insredible, stunning, massive! a cool drink was waiting for us, along with our keys, so well organised! the cases arrive in our room shortly after we get there. the rooms are big, disappointed the balcony is too small to really enjoy sitting on but this is only a minor disappointment, there is an over stocked minibar in the bathroom replenished every 2 days also 4 optics. ice machines various other apartment blocks around- 1 next to ours. the food is absoluteley amazing-anyone who moans about it must be really fussy.. there is every salad you can imagine, bread, 2 different soups, italian, mexican, pizza, fish(tho only 1 type) various potatoes and vegetables the list goes on it was all hot and tasty too! the desserts are not to be missed, many fruits, cakes, ice cream etc...must try the coconut ice cream!! our first morning we were greeted with rain, which lasted for the following day too. breakfast was amazing too, salads, cheeses,every egg every which way you can imagine, cereals, yogurt, freshly squeezed juices-including cactus juice! we booked for the asian restaurant for the evening meal,(we didnt have any trouble getting inwhen we booked at 10am for that evening) that is gorgeous too..beautiful sushi, chinese dishes, i had tuna medallion-hubby had sweet n sour pork.and the deep fried ice cream on a bed of belgium chocolate is a massive must!! another great thing about the tequila is the wi-fi in the lobby, it enabled me to keep in touch with my daughter via email and facebook. over the road to the left of the hotel is the riu playacar, smaller than ours but with a beach..must stay for lunch-they do a massive paella nearly every day, we sat and ate it on the beach! the sea is lovely blue and clear the sand is powdery and the water sports on offer are impressive. we got up on the sunday morning to find out we are on hurricane alert-this soon passed then the weather was fine for the duration. the sports bar on the tequila site is open 24/7 with food in a fridge to heat yourself. tried the steak restaurant, incredible! 5 courses..caesar salad then ckn wings onion rings, courgettes,side sauce. then 2 tone soup. then land and sea kebab, (hubby) i had the chicken with american mustard sauce,,then baked alaska. followed by tequila! the staff on this resort are so hard working especially the bar staff-the mango daiqiris became an obsession-sooo nice. must try the yucatan for the chocolate martini-lovely! the walk to playa del carmen is a must though its a good half hour and can be very hot-take water with you..we wandered round the back streets and bought a pork taco with all the trimmings for 40p! its very colourful. settled in a bar called zenzi on the beach expected it to be very expensive coz we lounged on their double bed on the beach while drinking chocolate martinis, 4 beers, 1 chocolate martini, 1 water was \u00a310 not bad-the photos i took were amazing. lunchtime at the tequila(we never did coz always full from breakfast) there is salad, soup,desserts,nachos with cheese sauce, burgers, chips etc all freshly cooked we were lucky we had room 1801 which was a little further back from reception, we were amazed by the funny little animals which were fox like and very tame they were around day and night and very funny! also saw iguanas monkeys and a funny pig like animal. to sum up our holiday i would definateley say its excellent value for money, food,staff,hotel are all incredible, the entertainment wasnt our cup of tea (i must say the team do work very hard tho) and i feel this is the only thing that lets thehotel down-all the shows are mimed and its difficult to get a seat but we would sit in the lobby with our mango daiquiris and people watch! we would be back there tomorrow if possible! 1 more useful tip, take your laundry into town it cost us \u00a31 to have ours washed and dried in 5 hours.. when we go back we will definateley stay at the tequila again and would try a couple of trips(coco bongos, cozumel, turtle beach) lastly please remember to take extra cash to tip good service, the wages are very low in mexico and they really work very hard and always with a smile, we would occasionally give 5 dollars for exceptional service and the odd dollar here and there otherwise. we hope you have a good a time as us!", "Date": "February 8, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manchester", "Title": "\u201cAbsolutely Fantastic 10/10\u201d", "Author": "Meerkat68", "ReviewID": "UR55396977", "Content": "Got back from the Riu Tequila on the 24th Jan after spending 2 fantastic weeks there. Having travelled all over the Carribean and having stayed in other so called 5* Hotels I have to say that the Tequila is the best of the lot. From arrival to departure we were looked after by the Hotel staff magnificantly, nothing was too much for them. Arrival at the hotel was the most efficient I have ever experienced, coach pulls up and all your cases are unloaded into the lobby area, you are given a nice refreshing drink and a cold face towel to wipe down with, you then go to a desk and pick up an envelope with your name on it, inside there are labels with your room number on, you stick these labels on your luggage and you're done, guys take groups of you through the complex and direct you to your room, in less than 10 minutes of arriving we were checked in, arm banded up and in our room with our luggage!!!. Brilliant!!. The Restauraunts: Main Buffet, served Breakfast and Dinner, 10/10, could not fault it in any way, and my expectations are pretty high when it comes to food. Breakfast offered you everything you could wish for about 12 kinds of cereal, toast, eggs done about 10 ways, bacon, hash browns and every other type of hot foods to make up an \"English Breakfast\", cold meats, cheeses, salads,yoghurts there was tea, coffee, fresh orange juice, the waiters were very attentive and efficient, clearing away and brining you fresh coffee if required. Lunch: This was served in the Pool Restauraunt, again plenty of cold meats and cheeses and salads together with, steaks, fish, burgers, hot dogs, chips [fries], pizza, pasta [usually 3 or 4 types] and there was usually something showy on like Paella or a B.B.Q. And desserts to die for, about a dozen types as well as plenty of fruit. Dinner: As above but there was ALWAYS some show cooking on, and there was always plenty of Mexican to pick from, Fajitas/burritos/nachos/chilli/re-fried beans, the pasta was made fresh for each individual guest [bit of a queue but well worth it], there was always a guy carving up full chickens or beef or pork or he had a huge paella on the go with the biggest prawns I have ever seen, the desserts were even more plentiful than at lunch, waiters were unbelieveable, after about 3 days of sitting in the same area we didn't even have to ask for a drink, the waiter saw us sitting down and by the time we were back with our starters he had already filled our glasses!!!, we sat at or around table 199 [between the salad bar and the main hot food section] the waiter was amazing. The lobby area is very nice and offers free internet [wi-fi], which is handy for those of you with lap tops and the latest phones!!!!, the main entertainment area is just to the side of the lobby area and the hotel staff put on some great evening entertainment, the kids are looked after early on with their own show, then it's time for the adults to be entertained, there is something on EVERY night. The bar in the lobby/entertainment area is a busy one but the staff are great and get to you quite quickly, there is another bar over to the side of the entertainment area which is a little quieter, this bar is next to the 24hr sports bar, in here [it's indoors] you can watch the football [soccer for the Canadians and yanks!!] as well as all sports from around the world, they also have snacks in here if you are having a late night burgers/hotdogs/pizza/sandwiches/fruit. There are 2 pools split by the Lunchtime Restauraunt [this is an ala carte steak restauraunt at night] and are very nice, the weather wasn't the greatest for the first week of our stay as it was cloudy all the time, but we still spent time by the pool our second week was red hot and the sunbeds in the sun were at a premium!!!!, people were still putting towels down and reservign beds before breakfast!!!!!, the pools are kept immaculate as is the rest of the complex, the staff work very hard and it shows as the whole place is spotless. You can also use the facilities at the Riu Lupita, PlayaCar & Yucatan you can drink in these 3 day and night and can have lunch in them also, the Yucatan and playa Car are on the beach but we preferred to walk back to the Tequila [or get the buggy!!!] for lunch as it was so much better. You can also get a pass to go into the 2 Riu Palace hotels, one is just over the road and the other one is about a 5 minute walk away, we only found \"pass to go into the Palace hotels\", not sure if you can eat and drink in them or not, but ask the rep, the reps never told us we could do this, this annoyed me a bit as i'd of liked to of had a look round them, you can also use one of the Wyndham hotels just down the road [again the reps never told us this] best to ask the reps about this!!!!. We went up to Cancun for the day \u00a32 each was on an air conditioned coach, and then about 30p each into the \"Zona Hoteleria\" where you tell the driver of the bus which hotel to drop you at and he will, again you can eat and drink [eat at lunch only] in either the Riu Cancun or the Riu Caribe, we spent most of the day and had lunch at the Riu Cancun, we then walked to the Riu Caribe [took about 45 mins], both hotels are very nice but the Riu Cancun was the better of the two. We went on 2 trips, firstly we went to Tulum, this was booked with the Reps [Thomson] cost $69 and was a halfday trip, the guide was very informative and the trip was well worthwhile, Tulum was a very nice place and the locals are very proud of it, and rightly so, it has been there for centuries. Second trip we went on was to Coba, to an ancient Mayan Temple/Pyramid, this is the only one that you can actually climb up, and boy is it worth climbing, this was the \"WOW\" moment of the entire holiday. On the way to Coba we went to visit a Mayan Family who lived in a traditional Mayan Village [they had a spider monkey as a pet!!], and we went to a Cenote [underground waterhole where you could swim if you wanted]. When you get to Coba you are given the option of walking to the Temple, hiring a bike or getting in a bike Taxi, take the Bike Taxi it is hilarious, you get driven to the temple through the jungle [it's about 2 miles away] and it costs 95 Pesos [less than \u00a35] the guy waits and brings you back as well!!!, it was the funniest thing on the holiday and we were laughing all the way there and back, we had a thunderstorm on the way back and this made the journey even funnier!!. Coba is a must do trip, climbing the Temple was amazing if a little scary, coming back down was a challenge and I never let go of the rope once!!!!!. We booked this trip through a guy called \"Roberto\" in the local shopping centre [turn left out of the hotel and it's about 300mtrs away], he has a small stall selling all sorts of trips, the trip cost us $99 each, it was $129 each with Thomson so well worth the 3 min walk!!!.The trip was excellent, the guide was brilliant, he had us laughing all day. I would recommend using these guys for all your trips as they use the same buses as the Thomson trips, Thomsons trips go from the shopping centre as well!!!, so you are just paying Thomson the extra for the convienience of booking in the hotel, walk the 300mtrs and give your money to a local Mayan business, it makes sense eh!!. I know this review is a bit long winded but i like to let people know about all sorts of things, like waliking into Playa Del Carmen, this will take you about 20-30 minutes but it's a great way of walking off dinner and the 5th avenue shopping area and the port are buzzing at night, it is also totally safe, we never felt in danger at any time, if you prefer there are always taxis in the hotel car park and in playa del carmen to bring you back it is 50 pesos each way, about \u00a32.50. There are loads of bars and restauraunts in Playa Del Carmen and they are very, very reasonable, we had lunch there one day, Cheesey Nachos [big bowl full], Chicken Fajitas and Chicken Burritos and a bottle of Sol Lager and a Tonic water and it came to about \u00a38. Finally, the Hotel Wildlife!!!!!!, the hotel say don't feed them, but how can you not!!, you have some things that look like giant guinea pigs and some other creatures that come off the golf course at the bcak of the hotel, these look like Small Racoons only a lot cuter!!!, they sit on their back legs and hold out their front paws to you, all the kids rush to the sports bar and get the bowls of chopped fruit when they see them, they usually appear at about 4ish near to the lobby bar, and there are loads of the things. Hope this review helps, we found the Hotel un-faultable [if that's a word!!!], and would recommend it to anyone, we would go back there in an instance, 10/10, well done Riu, your staff and hotel are to be commended.", "Date": "February 7, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "wisconsin", "Title": "\u201cAnother good Riu experience\u201d", "Author": "nana1441", "ReviewID": "UR55340334", "Content": "We have stayed at other Riu's and visited many sister properties.

To use the beach is a bit of a hike but like everyone else says the walkway they have truly is nice. The beach was closed for most of our vacation but is open now and way bigger!

Overall, an excellent vacation! Hotel: Very clean, lots of tropical plants, great path to walk to and from the room, beautiful grounds, cute little animals, great staff very helpful...We found it was more beautiful than the Yucatan and the Playacar. Small walk to the beach (about 5 minutes), but doesn't matter at all. Room : Very clean, excellent room service, always hot water... Food : We found the buffet was excellent....not bored after 10 days! Lots of choices and always mexican food. The lunch restaurants near the beach didn't have as much choice and are more ''fast food'' style, even though it is possible to eat well if you really want. Really good ice cream! A la Carte restaurants are not that good because the Steak House is not in a real restaurant, it's the pool restaurant. And the asiatic is in a cute place, but it is a buffet. Beach: Nice beach. We got used really quickly to the sand bags and it's not a problem. Always plenty of chairs to sit...It's quite windy, but it helps to tolerate the hot sun. Things we did and liked : Chichen Itza : 3 hours drive, but really impressive and the swim in a cenote is really nice! Tulum : only 45 min. from the hotel and really beautiful, near the beach...If you want to see at least one ruin site, go to Tulum. Isla Mujeres : cute little island where you can rent a golf cart (40$US) and go around the island which stayed typic. Cozumel : We rented a scooter (25$US). Much bigger island and a lot of snorkelling and diving to do. Playa Del Carmen : 25 minutes walk. 5th avenue is nice with a lot of stores... Tips: To go to Tulum, you can take the Collectivo which is the local bus and it only costs 30 pesos one way... You won't be desapointed. It's not a five stars if five stars mean a \"chic\" hotel...We would rate it a strong 4 stars.", "Date": "February 4, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "boston", "Title": "\u201cbeware of CATS!\u201d", "Author": "slc0208", "ReviewID": "UR55209096", "Content": "Let me start by saying I have been to 6 rui properties and have never had a bad vacation--some better than others but never bad! One down fall of the resort is that there are numerous cats around the grounds.....at times they \"cry out\", chase either, travel in packs of 6-8 and fight. I am not a big fan of cats.....bad experiences in the past....but I still think it was a bit much. One of my friends, who owns a cat, also at times found the cats distrubing and overbearing. All and all it was not a killer for me just found it funny that the cats where not mentioned in the reviews that I read prior to booking. There are other animals all over the resort also which at first are a little strange but you do get used to them---large squirrel like w/ racoon tails and small bunny like w/o a tail. They don't bother you at all just don't feed them off your balconey. This sounds like I'm freaked by animals.....I'm not just think a heads up is good!! Overall this riu was very much like the others I've been to. Food is good---as long as you are not super picky you can always find something. Drinks are plentiful......give the bartenders a couple of bucks every couple rounds and they don't forget you. The tequila is a cross the street from the beach......10min short walk down a pathway and you can use the facilities that the Yucatan ie:bars, pools, restrooms, lunch buffet. The beach is pretty big and chairs didn't seem to be a problem, however it wasn't that hot the week we where there. The nightime at tequila was good---as mentioned I have been to several other riu properties and the shows seem to be generally the same. Never made it to the disco but friends say it was \"ok.\" I you are looking to party all night.....you probably already have scoped out the night life in town which is plentiful so you won't be hanging in the disco tequila. Coco Bongo a must.....my friend and I went unwillingly (men wanted a night on the town). We had a blast!!! $50 well spent......includes drinks and entertainment. Overall loved Playa del carmen and would return to the Riu tequila if the price was right. Going on a extended family trip in 6/10, considered Riu tequila but some are first timers ...beach front is in everyones carribean/mexican imagination I think!!! Feel free to email any questions.....

We chose the Tequila, because it appeared to have a lush lanscape of trees and flowers. We were not disappointed. It was awesome!! Our room was very clean, with housekeeping service daily. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The pools were great, a relaxing place to read a book, or just get a tan. Be sure to get there early though, if you want a prime lounge chair in the sun. There is a show every night. Some are cheesy, but others are very entertaining. They are designed toward adults though, just an FYI. There is a kids club, and they perform a show everynight before the main attraction. Very cute! The beach is a short walk (about 5 minutes) across the street. We didn't mind this at all. There is a beautiful paved and covered walkway to get there. A nice relaxing stroll. The beach is beautiful. They were regrading it during most of our stay, which was very disappointing, and something no one could control. It is even nicer now. The other Resorts that are also open to Tequila guests are nice, The Yucatan more then The Playacar. There is a shopping plaza just up the street that is very nice and has quite afew shops. You can also easily walk, (about 1 1/2 miles), or take a taxi into the town of Playa del Carmen. There are alot of shops there, a public beach, and the Ferry service to Cozumel. ( one-way tickets are $11 dollars). The food at the resort is good, but not outstanding. The breakfast buffet is good, and the dinner bufet is pretty good too, with a different theme every night. Lunches are very boring, and the food is the same everyday. The Ala Carte Restraunts are very good. They do require reservations that you can make in the morning outside the buffet restraunt before breakfast. Be sure to sign up in the morning, cause they are usually full by 9:00-9:30am. We read alot of reviews before we settled on the Tequila. After doing that and then seeing it first hand this is our impression. If you go to a 4-5 star resort, it will be very good, but not 6 star. If you expect 6 star food, service, and accomodations, go to a 6 star resort, don't complain about the 4-5 star resort because it doesn't meet your expectations.

When we arrived, we had a cocktail in reception, and left our luggage, and the porters brought it to the room. The room was spotless! Minibar and Optics were full (although we never used much of them through the holiday. We liked going down to the bar) The grounds are immaculate, and there is always someone cleaning and gardening through the day to keep everything looking neat and tidy. It is about a 5 minute walk to the beach through a covered walkway. We never used the little buggie service as we prefered to walk off breakfast. The red flag was up for our whole holiday, but that wasnt a bad thing. People still went into the sea and were having fun. The food was amazing! We didnt try the mexican restaurant. We were told that the mexican night they have every monday in the main buffet restaurant was better than the Mexican restaurant. We were satisfied with the food in the main restaurant so didnt bother booking for the Mexican. We did go to the Bamboo restaurant which was amazing, and the steakhouse was lovely. We usually went to eat at around 9pm in these restaurants. We found 7pm a bit of a rush because after a long day sunbathing and doing absolutely nothing, we felt the need for an afternoon snooze at about 5-6pm for an hour. We never got bored of the food in the main restaurant. It was delicious! The entertainment staff are out of this world. The shows they put on in the night were unbelievable! They are all fantastic dancers! Im not normally someone who enjoys hotel entertainment, but these guys and girls work so hard, and put on a brilliant show. Especially the Michael Jackson show!!! Thomson reps were brilliant. The caribbean party the staff hold on the volleyball court is a must! There you can see them carving watermelons, ice sculptures, have a bit of a dance and some sangria! The pool is lovely. Bit cold in the mornings, but lovely to cool off after sitting in the heat for so long! We went to the disco in the hotel a few times. This was really good, especially if the animation staff are in there having a boogie with you! This hotel is fantastic, and we would recommend it to anyone. We are definately going to go back.

We had fun dancing at the disco but keep an eye on your drinks to make sure no one puts anything in them. You don't have to worry about any other bar with your drinks. The staff were very polite, good service and entertaining. They had good shows in the evening. The pool was nice and clean. Plenty of lounge chairs and a huge pool bar (big plus). Didn't matter that were weren't on the beach because it was under construction from the Playacar to the Yucatan. They gave free bus rides to Mamitas beach. Very close to 5 Ave only $5 cab ride lots of cool shops there, bit pricey with somethings but definitely worth checking out.

The staff work incredibly hard and could not do enough for you. Booking in was easy, the entire form filling was left until the following day. We arrived early evening due to bad weather in the UK but 10 minutes later we were in the restaurant enjoying our evening meal. The waiters serve you drinks and clear away your finished plates while you choose from the buffet. Daily fresh fruit, wide variety of hot and cold dishes to suit most palates. Theme nights also add variety to the menu. Speciality Restaurants include the Steak House and Bamboo. The Bamboo was my favourite, sushi and Chinese, though again it was buffet. The Steak House does Sirloin, Rib Eye, Pork chops and chicken and this was waiter service. After the evening meal there\u2019s always a show on in the Theatre, Mama Mia, Moulin Rouge, Michael Jackson Tribute to name but a few. The Animation Team work very hard, they start at 10 in the morning trying to get you to join in with various activities. At lunch time (buffet again in an outdoor restaurant), they come and sit with the diners. The shows are very good and entertaining, no waiter service for drinks, though they did clear away the empties. The rooms are cleaned every day and kept spotless. Optics in the rooms contains whisky, vodka, gin and tequila. The fridge holds 4 bottles of beer, coke, orange, sprite and water. Everything is replenished every 2 days. I can heartily recommend the Chichen Itza trip, try to get the tour guide Victor \u2013 his passion for the Mayans and knowledge of the site is excellent, he also gets you to the locations first which is a must for the Ik Kil Cenote. The Cons A 5* hotel though it is not. Don't go expecting 5* gourmet food, restaurants, swimming pools etc because you'd be disappointed. In peak season expect to fight for the sunbeds and queue for the buffet food. If you get bored with similar types of food, the menu may not be varied enough. There is no choice of wine except red, white or ros\u00e9. The shows get very busy because people from the surrounding Riu hotels also come to watch. Our room block was quiet, but others complained about very noisy people with banging doors all night. Three cats wander into the open air lunch buffet area. Birds fly into the open air lunch buffet area and pinch food off plates. At the moment the beach is out of bounds because the Mexican government is doing restoration work. You travel 5,500 miles to go swimming in the Caribbean and get stopped the last 20 feet by a 3 foot pipe!! Thomson gave no warning about this before or at the Welcome Meeting. The hotel have laid on a free bus to a local beach, but you have to pay for the sunbeds, are not allowed to eat any other foods except that purchased on that beach and obviously have to buy drinks. Not really All Inclusive. One Canadian tour operator was handing out $200 compensation vouchers. Conclusion Would I go again?

If you are going with a large group you might want to check in with the front desk and see if it\u2019s possible to rent a van with a driver for the day.

What a wonderful experience even if the weather was colder than we had hoped on 3 out of the 6 days we were there, which is no fault of the resort at all. Upon arrival at the Riu Tequila, we were greeted by an awesome staff that really did want to make sure you were taken care of. I don't think we ever passed a staff person without at least a smile, but most of the time it was a very friendly HOLA! There really wasn't much to complain about the resort at all, but I will only point out the \"negatives\" if you can consider them. - The heating/cooling system in the room was uncontrollable. We found controlling the temperature at night was most easily done by opening the patio door, which was screened. (Keep in mind that the temps were real moderate this time of year) - No coffee maker or room service was available. - The bathroom had no vents, so retained humidity from showering within the entire room. - The soaps and shampoos do not lather, so bring your own. - Food at the buffet got a little repetitious. That was probably our fault for not venturing to the sit-down restaurants (which required reservations) or the other resorts we had access to. - Drinks are served in small glasses. Bring your own insulated mug. Especially handy at the beach. (not really a negative, just a suggestion for future visitors) - No Internet access in the rooms & only about 6 English speaking channels on the television. ------------------------------------------------------------------- About the entire trip experience.... I have a whole new respect for the Mexican people and their culture. The trip down to Riviera Maya from Cancun was about a 45-60 minute bus ride, so keep that in mind. The trip does allow you to take in the country which was incredibly beautiful. I was actually very surprised of the cleanliness. As my first trip outside of America, I was surprised to see the police carrying around machine guns and wearing bandoleers across both shoulders. Crime is not a concern though after speaking to a couple of the locals. KEEP THIS IN MIND: If you go anywhere or do anything, you are going to experience people that are trying to earn a tip in one way shape or form. They make very little in their jobs and count on your tips. Going to an All-Inclusive, we still tipped plenty. Keep in mind that these people survive off of this and they will work incredibly hard to get that tip. Lastly, at all costs avoid the booths scattered around the shops. They are there trying to sell you time shares. You'll probably be alerted to this at your check in. They are incredibly pushy. Book your trips at your resort for the sake of convenience.

I have to say that the staff at this hotel are the best staff that I have met anywhere in the world. They always have a smile and friendly hello to everyone even if some do not say it back! The cleaning staff that clean the rooms are great, they leave towel art for you which is lovely. The rooms are spacious and really clean, the only grumble that I have is that the shower could do with a light in it. The food does get a bit boring after two weeks but there is always something to eat. I wouldn't say that this hotel does food 24 hours as after 10.30pm the only food that you can get is in the sports bar which is hotdogs etc are in a fridge and you heat it up in a microwave! The beach is nice, not the most pretiest beach that I have seen but good none the less. If you go on any trips I would suggest the Fat Cat Catermeran snorkle trip. The guys on the boat are great fun. Also Xel-Ha is a great day especially the Dolphins, if you get a chance to swim with them you must do it. The most awsome experience. The only bad thing ( not that big a bad thing but annoying) is when ever you go into any shops especially 5th Avenue they try to get you to come into their shop and then they haggle you for a price. It got very tiresome after a while and then just couldn't be bothered to shop anymore. Also if you are travelling from England don't bother buying Mosquito spray ( jungle formula) the mossies lick it off then bite you! wait till you arrive and then but one called OFF it is what the locals use. I still go bit but not as much as when I used the one from England. The Thomson staff at the hotel are great especially Mayeli she is lovely.

We have stayed at many all inclusive hotels over the past 20 years. We prefer Iberostar and Riu for their quality of service. We like Playa del Carmen and have stayed at the Riu Playacar, Riu Palace and the Iberostar Pariso. This was a budget trip for us as have not been on vacation since 2006 due to finances. We had visited the Riu Tequila in 2006 while we stayed at the Palace so we knew what to expect. I had requested a 2nd floor room via email but we were given a 1st floor room upon arrival. When mentioned to the desk attendant they asked us to wait an hour or 2 and a 2nd floor room would be available and it was. Now the Tequila is not the Palace and we knew this going in. We were the 900 building with a back room that faced some palm trees. The room was lovely and clean with a lovely little deck facing the back of the building. The breakfast and dinner buffets were as good as any all inclusive though not as fancy as the palace. Again, we knew this going in so no surprise. We did find the lunch buffet to be less than adequate though. We usually ate in the Riu Yucatan for lunch as we prefer the beach to the pool. Perhaps it was because we ate around 1:30 to 2:00 but we found that as they were winding down certain dishes were not replaced. Only one dessert one day, no steak another day, the same with salsa and guacamole. Always something to slightly annoy us. It certainly didn't ruin our trip though. We managed to find something and leave satisfied. At the Tequila we had dinner at the steak house and the Asian place. I preferred the Asian for the variety. At the steak house we both had the rib eye which we found tasty but the mashed potatoes were instant ( we think) and loaded with salt. The service was always very very good. Drinks- the rose wine was passable, the mojitos and mango diaquires tasty but weak. My husband said the beer ( dos equis) must be low alcohol. He preferred the bottled beer in the room. We brought along a small cooler for the beach and asked the cleaning staff for mucho dos equis left on a note with a few $$ each day. They usually replace the drinks every 2 days but she was good enough to give 4 bottles each day. Our favorite bar tenders were Carlos and Eduardo at the Yucatan pool bar. They managed to remember us and present us with our favorite drinks when we sat down. We did not go there every day and we did not spend more than an hour each time and they still remembered us. I'm not sure but we think that the drinks became stronger in the evenings. We also like to tip so maybe the drinks were stronger because of that. I think all inclusives are always a bit lacking in food and drink quality anyway but we still manage to find something delicious to rave about. The Tequila is not on the beach, but the 4 minute walk was pleasant and I imagined I was walking off some of that cheesecake from the night before, ha! I still managed to gain 5 lbs in one week. The beach still had the sand bags but it wasn't nearly as bad as the Iberostar Tucan and Sandos Playacar. They are south of the Riu Yucatan, the beach was really terrible at Sandos. There is construction going on south of Sandos so it is roped off. North of the Yucatan the beaches were adequate. We went into playa on the one of the overcast days but otherwise no excursions. The weather is iffy this time of year. We had 5 good days and 2 overcast. I needed a sweater on a few of the evenings.

Right from immediate contact with the staff of the resort we were impressed by the efficiency and hard work that we witnessed. The food is excellent and if you cannot find something that you like to eat, I would suggest that you would only be happy cooking for yourself (probably best to stay at home). The beach is a 10 minute walk down a lovely walkway or through either of the other two Riu's that you are allowed to use for lunch and drinks etc. We enjoyed the walk but there was also a golf cart kind of vehicle to take you. The beach and ocean were lovely but do not expect a quiet beach, there are many sun loungers. A lot of people used their own laptops in the hotel lobby so I assume the wifi worked well. The rooms, restaurants, washrooms, in fact everywhere was immaculate. The only comment we had was that we had booked two early morning alarm calls and the first did not come and the second was 20 mins late so I would suggest setting your phone/watch or the alarm clock in the room. It is a lively resort and I am guessing that January is not high season so am assuming it becomes more so during the summer, so I would say that if you want a quiet romantic resort, this may not be the best choice for you but it was full of both young and old couples, extended families, singles, children and everyone seemed to be having a good time. There were several people in wheelchairs and I asked one lady how she found the accessibility and she thought they catered to her very well. We took a scuba intro through Club Caribe Dive Centre and was very impressed at the professionalism, knowledge and patience (I was a big girlie) of the instructor. The ocean dive was fantastic.

We took our family of 3 kids aged 8, 4 and 2 for some winter sun and I booked a package for 2 weeks through Thompsons. I really did not know what to expect but I had an idea that the resort would be tacky and full of tatooed yobs and brash americans . Well I must say that I was completely wrong- the hotel is really very nicely decorated and the staff were unbelievably friendly and helpful. We were slightly cramped in a single room with 2 large double beds but the hotel were happy the put in another single bed and a cot. I would have preferred a suite with two separate rooms but I don't think that this type of accomodation is available so bear that in mind when you book. If you are looking for a 5 star resort with gourmet dining then this is not the place for you- I would classify this as a basic 4 star resort with average but acceptable dining. There is a main dining room where you have your breakfast which I must say I could not fault- freshly squeezed juices, fresh fruit, cereals, cold meat any egg you could wish for, mounds of bacon, sausages, cakes, doughnuts, porridge, mexican varieties etc. Lunches were held at the pool resuarant and were the usual hot dogs, hamburgers, pizza a variety of salads, fried fish and a choice of 2-3 meat dishes which changed day by day- all round edible but not fantastic. I won't go into the dinner choices but there was a huge variety to suit all tastes but generally very average with the occasional nice dish- I noticed that you could judge who had just arrived at the resort based on the height of food on their plates, which diminishes day by day until you are so sick of buffet eating you are forced to go into playa del carmen for some local fare which was delicious. I can recommend La Bamba in Jarocha (Harocha) cnr 30th and 34th- a great restaurant filled with locals- food is safe to eat- we had lobster and prawns and survived, prawns cost around \u00a38 for 15 shrimp and humungous lobster around \u00a320. Beware of the green dip on the table- real habanero power. The pool area is great- divided into 2 separate pools on either side of the restaurant- swim up bar, a great play area with any sport you can think of and the staff arrange activities all day. On the alcohol front you will not want for anything- almost every type of spirit- always available, beer on tap but only local wines- so the fundi's will be dissapointed - rooms come fitted with 4 bottels- rum, tequila, vodka which are filled every 2 days- I don't think we even touched it. We were quite dissapointed with the kids club which consisted of one guy looking after 20+ kids. The policy is that only 4 year olds and over are admitted so if you are looking to have some 'you' time I suggest a baby sitter or another hotel. The hotel is not located right on the beach but is a very short 5min walk between 2 other hotels and well worth it- lovely white sand and the water is clear and warm. It is a busy beach so if you are looking for seclusion I would not recommend it. The hotel is well located for an amazing array of things to do from snorkelling to skydiving, I suggest booking your tours at the Wal Mart in Playa del Carmen- upto 50% cheaper than the hotel. I can recommend Xcaret for kids and the dolphin experience- best thing my kids have done, and the quad bike tour (through walmart tour stand) was incredible fun and great value for money. Overall we thought this was a lovely resort, the staff were amazing but I'm not sure if we would go back as there is so much choice in the area I think I would like to try something new possibly with no buffet.

They had an amazing time joining in all the activities, they met so many new friends from across the world, they were in awe of the entertianment team who worked tirelessly to ensure everyone had a good time, for a family holiday this place is first class. The best thing about the Tequila was that ALL staff members wore a smile on their faces, it all added to the feel good factor. It took us approximately 50 minutes transfer time from the airport, be careful when you colect your luggage there, some guys try to take your luggage from you and take it to your coach, they expect hefty tips, so ensure you have change if you want them to take your luggage for you. On arrival at the hotel, we were greeted with a non alcoholic refreshing cocktail, our luggage was collected from the coach and we next saw it when it was delivered to our room. Check in was really swift, and we loved our rooms. The fridge and mini bar were well stocked and kept so throughout our stay (topped up every 2nd day), the rooms were spotless, spacious and there were ample selection of tv channels to watch if you wanted to relax in your room in the afternoon or evening. The maid service was brilliant, lovely animals made from towels left on the bed daily. The food was great, although repetitive by the second week, we managed to always find a choice to eat and there was always an abundance of food. The xmas eve dinner wa out of this world, the effort that was made was outstanding with huge ice sculptures and decorations. The menu was exquisite, although I would have preferred for there to have been 3 sittings for dinner as opposed to 2, it may have made it a little easier when queining for food, but overall it was a special evening. The entertainement team were superb, the daily activities they ran, suited all ages, their pleasant manners and love of their jobs was clear to see, their work rate was second to none. The evening shows were amazing, we thoroughly enjoyed each of them, with Moulin Rouge, Grease and Thriller being our favourites but the Crazy show was a great laugh too. The beach was beautiful despite the sand whales there, it was always easy to obtain a sun lounger and the sea was welcoming and clear. We used the beach in preference to the pool at the Tequila as it was quite busy there and most of the area was shaded for most of the day, it was also a little hectic by the pool at times and yes there were a few folks who were there at the crack of dawn laying their towels on the sun loungers which was disappointing to see. The whole complex was fantastic, super clean, the number of staff working here is beyond belief, there was always someone tidying the gardens, paths, cleaning, etc etc, everyone from the maids to the bar staff were friendly and helpful. We tried the steak house and Asian restaurants and were pleased with them both, my partner preferring the steak house for the waiter service. We visited the Yucatan several times during our stay, but much preferred the 'buzzing atmosphere' that the Tequila offered. We went on a ferry across to Cozumel island, the weather was not so good on that day and we thought we would do some shopping, however we got the 12pm ferry there and the 1pm ferry back, the harrassing from the shopworkers to enter their stores was too much for us, we were so relaxed back at the Tequila that we made our way back there without making a single purchase. We were also advised not to make any purchases until after 2pm when those from the cruise ships which dock most days, had returned to their ships, as the prices were reduced once they had left!!! I would probably go back to Cozumel but hire a car and take a trip to see the Island rather than shop there. There was no need to spend any money at the Tequila, all of our needs were met, in fact most of our holiday budget was given in tips to various staff members from waiters and maids to entertaiment team members, they deserved every peso they got. Currency, I would advice you to take sterling or pesos, we went into Playa Del Carmen 5th Avenenue for a meal, we paid in pesos, but were given the option to pay in us dollars, we saved over \u00a310, by paying in Pesos, this was the case in most purchases we found. There is a place on 5th Ave which has currency exchange and offered a better rate than what we got in the UK, or at the hotel and without a commission fee, it may be worth checking. The only grumble I would have about this holiday is some of the guests lacking in manners, not being able to form a queue in the buffet restaurants and not using please or thank you when ordering at the bar, good manners cost nothing. The aiport tax was $55us dollars, \u00a338 or 640 mexican pesos, quite a cost at the end of ones holiday, so please ensure you are aware of this before you go.

The evening shows were also well produced and well worth staying up for. You can access the beach either by the golf cart or by crossing the road and walking down the side of the Yucatan & the Palace, it really doesn't take that long. On the beach there are lots of sunbeds, water activities, and you can use the facilities of the Yucatan to ensure the family are well watered, fed and toilets are within easy reach. Not the largest of beaches but it was clean, white sand, palm trees and turquise water. Unfortunately the red flag was out for most of our holidays but we still enjoyed jumping the waves, making sandcastles and our son had a fantastic scuba experience. Definately the best hotel we have been to so far, both kids 10 & 4 had a great time, the hotel has a great atmosphere, the people are friendly, there is plenty to do, very safe and great hotel layout, other than the excursions which are expensive it was very good value for money, nothing else to lay out for accept more sun cream, sombreros and unfortunately the departure tax on the way home.

We were surprised how many of the guests were European. A lot for England, and many from other parts of Western Europe. Some Americans too, but seemed to be more at Riu Yucatan and Riu Playacar. We liked how international it was, although it seemed like almost everyone staying there was white which felt a bit weird to us. The staff was friendly and helpful. The only thing that didn't seem very well run was the children's club. We didn't use it but saw it in progress several times. Seemed like one overwhelmed young Mexican staff memeber and lots of wild British kids of various ages. We thought the food was good in general and there was lots of choice, but there wasn't a good way to wash your hands before eating (bathroom was far from much of seating in the main dining room - and everyone, hundreds of people, share the same serving utensils. I tried to bring anti-bacterial wipes and gel to the meals, but often forgot it. In NYC people are pretty careful about germs - subways, lobby doors, etc and wash hands often, so thinking of all the germs bugged me - but didn't really seem to bother anyone else as far as I could tell. I'm not drinking at all, pregnant, but they have a big virgin drink list and those drinks were delicious and my 2 yr old could have a bunch of them - all natural made with fruit and milk. We didn't like our first room, on the first floor near the stage - noisy and mosquitoes - so we switched to one further on the 2nd floor and liked it better. The rooms were basic but in good condition and kept clean. One bummer, no bathtub. My 2 year old didn't like having to be in the shower. We expected the rooms to be a little bigger, but they were fine (we were in the standard one, a double). They don't provide conditioner so bring that. The grounds are lovely and the pool is big and nice, but it is not heated. We had cool weather so we couldn't use the pool. I would have liked something we could swim or even sit in that was heated. Even the kiddie pool, which isn't great, was pretty cold most of the time. We walked to the beach, never took the golf cart thing. Not a big walk and easy with a stroller, but we just didn't have good weather so we didn't go to the beach much. You can walk to town, Playa del Carmen in about 20 min or so. It is extremely touristy, so it won't be like getting to the real Mexico - you are pretty much in touristland the whole time you are in the playacar area. The town sells tons of touristy stuff from all over Mexico. It is a good half day trip if you need something to do in cold weather. There are a bunch of other fun trips you can do in the area, our 2 yr old was too young to enjoy most of them. We went to Tulum. It was ok. If you take the HotelBeds shuttle to the resort expect it might take 2 hrs rather than 1. Lots of stops at other hotels.

The pools were lovely and clean, the room was just right although a bath might have been nice, and the food was good -we visited the Mexican (not so good) and the Steak House speciality restaurants (dealt with me being a vegetarian very well). The staff are lovely and we really enjoyed the Michael Jackson show and the Horror Show.

We were there for a week in mid-December. We weren't sure what to expect based on other reviews, mostly raving and some complaining, but I must say that it was well worth the money and we had a very enjoyable time. First of all, the staff were amazing and went out of their way to greet us and make sure that we were comfortable. Claudia, a front desk employee, greeted us with cocktails as we got out of the shuttle and explained the entire Riu complex and their facilities very well (where we had access (Yucatan, Playacar, Lupita) and where we didn't (Palace)). This was awesome to know because it would've been a hassle to walk all the way to Tequila for lunch. Claudia spoke and understood English very well, which was great for us and whenever we had questions, she helped us out tremendously. She also went out of her way to help us be in touch with our tour company when there was a bit of confusion surrounding the date. She took care of that for us and we were very very appreciative. All of the employees around the resort, the bartenders, waiters/watiresses, restaurant greeters (Oscar), chefs, etc were very friendly. The manager, Joseph, also went out of his way to greet us during dinner one night and asked how everything was, and of course we let him know that everything was excellent. There was only one small mix-up surrounding what had happened to our beach towels when we left for our excursion one day and since there was a bit of a language barrier with one of the front desk employees, I got frustrated and was not happy that I may have to fork out money for these \"missing towels\". However, it turned out that the cleaning staff had put them out on our balcony which we didn't know. So, it was fine once it got cleared up and just a minor thing in the course of our week there, although at the time it was troublesome. The resort itself was very pretty and had an open, airy feeling. There were beautiful gardens and greenery. There were also cute raccoon-like animals hanging around that were harmless and entertaining to see. The pools were nice and not overly crowded, although we didn't hang out there, but went to the beach everyday. We took a dip a couple of evenings to hang out and look at the stars as we floated around the water. That was fun kind of fun since we were in silly moods from drinking all day. = ) The walk to the beach was easy and also enjoyable underneath a canopied walkway. It wasn't a problem at all to walk there. We somehow just always missed the buggy going back and forth, but with all we had to eat there, the walk was probably good. The beach was also very pretty, although a bit more crowded for my taste, but it was huge and there was plenty of room. We hung out two days outside of the Riu Playacar and it seemed a bit more private, although there wasn't much shade there. The Turquesa restaurant was right there on the beach and the lunch buffet was awesome. Every buffet had the fruit, salads, guac, salsa, mexican food, italian style food, and then pizzas, burgers, hot dogs etc. for the kids, I suppose. We stayed outside the Yucatan beach teh last two days since we had easier access to the shade underneath all of the palm trees. The view was awesome from the beach club restaurant and we discovered a nice spot at the Yucatan pool overlooking the beach, but still getting some shade which was nice. ( We got a bit burnt and were a little cautious towards the end.) We really enjoyed the buffet meals. My sister is vegetarian and she did fine as well. Breakfast and dinner are what we experienced there and it was really awesome. Everything was very fresh. Fruits (watermelon, pineapple, grapefruit, papaya) and salads, guacamole, freshly chopped salsa and sauces. Omelette buffet every morning. Freshly squeezed juice every morning (pineapple, papaya, melon, nola cactus, banana w/milk, beetroot, etc). So awesome. Dinner had different choices most of the evenings, again with mexican, italian and american style foods. The chefs were busy at cooking the entire time and everything was made fresh on the spot. The drinks were definitely on the very sweet side and not very strong, but that's okay. We were just happy to have access and we fixed this by simply asking for shots that we poured in to fix it. The margaritas were okay. Definitely added a shot of tequila when needed. Drinks varied by bartender. The mojitos were really really good. Not quite as sweet as the other fruity drinks and with an extra half shot of rum, it was perfect. The daiquiris were also very good. They have some special Riu shot that they do that was quite festive and had an interesting flavor. The shows were fun to watch too. We enjoyed the Horror show. Great performances and music. We had fun hanging around in the evening and enjoying a cocktail or two after a long day in the sun. The \"disco\" was interesting. Not my cup of tea, but we checked it out for a bit before going to bed. We met and saw some interesting people and definitely were in the minority being American. Lots of Europeans (Spain, France, Sweden, England, Italy), Canadians, and others. So many people were speaking other languages and it was very interesting and fun to be around that. All in all, we had a very comfortable, relaxing and enjoyable vacation. It was definitely touristy and there tons of people everywhere. But it was nice to be in an all-inclusive resort where meals and drinks were taken care of. Normally, we prefer a more \"rootsy\" experience and not so touristy, but for sake of comfort and relaxation, and since the price was right, it definitely served it's purpose beyond anything we had expected. As long as you're not a huge foodie and expect perfect gourmet meals, we had many satisfying meals. We did venture out to Playa one day to shop and eat and that was fun. We ate a meal there and it was great. It was a bit of a struggle to shop there and bargaining gets very draining after a full day. Whatever shopping we had left over, we did at the Playacar district which was about a five minute walk to the left. Very easy. A bit more expensive, but less pressure and great selection. All in all, we had a great time with no worries about where and when we would eat next. Our rooms were very comfortable with a great shower, ample vanity space, and nice minibar. We definitely left feeling relaxed and pampered and probably 5 lbs heavier, but I definitely recommend it. I would come back with a group of friends when it's time to have a relaxing vacation because everything was so carefree, and hassle free and beautiful. Just so easy to hang out, eat well, drink, and be merry.", "Date": "December 21, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ontario", "Title": "\u201cSecond visit to the Tequila - Absolutely wonderful\u201d", "Author": "riucanadagirl", "ReviewID": "UR51489763", "Content": "Second visit to the Tequila (first in 2002). Stayed 11 nights. What can I say. From the time you check in until you check out, the service is impeccable. Staff go out of their way to ensure you have the best vacation experience possible. I want to mention a couple staff members that in our opinion were simply outstanding: First an evening server at the main buffet restaurant (Hilario). We sat in his section 4 times for dinner and after the first evening he knew our standard drink order. He always seemed so cheerful and had the greatest smile. The kids (and us) thought he was simply great and really went the extra mile. My husband was getting his second plate of food one evening. Hilario during this time took away his half finished coffee and by the time he sat back down had gotten him fresh coffee. That is just one example of the extra mile this man went to ensure a great dining experience for us. Second, Claudia at the front desk. During our vacation I lost a pair of glasses. This woman went out of her way to assist me in trying to locate them. Sadly I was not able to find them but she did everything she could do to try and help me with this situation. Rooms - Rooms have been completely renovated last year and when you walk into the room it looks brand new. Two double beds pushed together, TV with tons of satellite channels, very large balcony, ample shower, ample space overall for two adults and two older kids. Absolutely spotless. Brand new flooring, countertop, tile, furniture, paint. Realized that there are two sizes of standard rooms. We were first assigned to a \"smaller\" standard room in building 21 (know this from having stayed there in the past and had a much larger standard room them). Went to the front desk and eas told that resort was at 100% occupancy (which I knew was not true). I was told to come back later in the day to check. Went back a little later and was told that we could be moved immediately to a different building (the building that we had stayed at on our first visit). This building definately had the \"larger\" standard rooms. Since building 21 houses the junior suites, I wonder if the standard rooms in only this building are smaller then all the others due to the extra space that the junior suites require? I wonder why they originally would have assigned us ( 2 adults, 2 older kids) to a building that offered the smaller rooms. O well, it all worked out eventually for us. General impression of the hotel - Lobby area and all common areas (walkways, bars, restaurants, washrooms ) are spotless. Actually the common areas look like a brand new resort. There are staff cleaning all the time. Food - Although there for 11 nights, we only ate at the main buffet (breakfast, dinner) and the buffet at the pool (lunch). Food offers vary each day and we were never disappointed. Food was always presented very nicely and always hot and tasted very fresh. Not once in 11 nights we were diappointed with what was served at the buffet. On the spot cooking stations were great as well as the 6 or 7 kinds of fresh fruit juice (mornings) were a great bonus for us. Entertainment staff: Great group of people that work VERY long hours to ensure everyone is having a great time. Their performances in the evening shows were excellent as well. Pools: I am not complaining at all but I will admit that since the huge renovation last year, the entire resort (except the pools) looks brand new. The pools on the other hand look the way they did 7 years ago. They have definately been repainted but in all honesty I tend to stay at resorts that offer much more (ex. lazy rivers, MUCH larger free form pool areas) so the pools were great at the Tequila but did show their age and just in my opinion were not quite up to the standard of the rest of the resort. Other travellers: Seemed to be mostly British people who were there for 2 weeks. Quite a few extended (grandparents, parents, kids) families which was really nice to see. Very few Americans and Canadians. Also quite a few Spanish speaking tourists. Everyone we had conversations with seem to be really enjoying themselves. Not once did we talk to anyone who had anything negative to say about the resort. One thing I did notice was that the evening dress was MUCH more casual then our visit 7 years ago. We brought some resort dressy clothes (for the evenings) but thankfully didn't feel the need to wear them every night. We did \"dress up\" a few evenings but not to the extent that we felt we had to 7 years ago. The last couple nights we were there a lot more families arrived (for Christmas) but prior to this we didn't see a lot of children. Other tid bits: Can't comment on the kids club since our kids did not attend. It is great how you have access to other RIU resorts (pools, food, entertainment) which was great since we were able to spend a lot of time at the Yucatan which gave us access to both pools and beach. Walking towards town quite a distance (past al lthe hotels) you are able to view two different Mayan Ruin areas. I actually thought that these ruins would be very minor but to our surprise the ruins comprised of several buildings and were impressive (no entrance fee). We also walked all around Playacar in the evenings with our children and not once did we feel unsafe whatsoever. Well lit, great sidewalks as well. I can't imagine going to this resort and not having a really great time.

However, they refused to call Expedia or even let me call them from the front desk and made me walk 10 minutes to the closest payphone at a shopping plaza.

After a hour and a half transfer to the hotel we were greeted with a warm reception, we were then given our room keys, because we had a wedding booked there we were told that we would have a room upgrade but we got given a standard room, being tired after the flight we just stopped in that room for the night, the next morning we went to see the Thomson rep Wendy who was very helpful and upgraded us to a junior suite, which was a fantastic spacious room. After 2 days at the hotel we had not received any information from the wedding co-ordinators about organising our wedding so we asked Wendy again, she said we should of received a pack with the date and time for the meeting but yet again this had been forgot, we were also told that we had to fill a form in from this pack on the day of our arrival to give witness names for the wedding, and they were going to charge us $5 for each witness as we had not done this on day of arrival, we were not impressed that we had to pay this when it was the wedding co-ordinators that had made a mistake! In the end Wendy gave us the $20 to pay for this. On the day of the wedding we got to the alter and there was no sign of the photographer, the wedding co-ordinator rang her and she thought the wedding was at 4pm and not 3pm! So hence no proffesional photos of the cermony! (good job our family took some!) ...but they did offer us 24 photos free for the mistake, after complaining again to Wendy and Josef, the customer service manager (who was very helpful) We opted for the wedding in the gardens as we had seen a wedding on the beach and you get everyone in their swimwear gathering around so they are in your photos! The beach is NOT private at all, the gardens are private we did not have any nosey hotel guests there at all.

In early December the crowd was a mix of a few families and lots of couples, our American accents were definitely in the minority as most of the guests seem to come from Europe. I'll mention the couple of things that might steer people away from this resort, 1st it's not on the beach so there are no beach view rooms and you have to walk about 5 minutes or take a golf cart across the street to the beach. I imagine you can still walk on the beach at night but you'd have to walk through the resort and not along the path. 2nd, it's one of the resorts furthest away from PDC, on foot it took us about a 1/2 hour, about 15 minutes more than the Reef Playacar which is the closest AI in Playacar. But for us it's a perfect place, we like to walk so we enjoy the walk into town. And we enjoyed walking along the beach after the resorts end, you can walk about 40 minutes each way. We enjoy the food at the buffet so much that we didn't even sign up for the specialty restaurants, I was trying to eat a bit healthier on this trip and there was plenty of fruit and healthier choices. I always head to the Mexican section of the buffet and fill up there but there are plenty of other choices. The coconut ice cream was a must at every dinner and I ate lots and lots of guacamole which was always there for lunch and dinner. The room was clean and comfortable with an in room safe, TV, small fridge, four bottles of liquor tap style, lots of bottled water and soft drinks. The shower always had hot water, the toiletries are a bit limited although I could have gotten by without bringing my own. We didn't use the pool at our resort, instead we spent most of our time across the street at the other Riu on the beach, we used their beach chairs and pool. Lots of shade on the beach, the beach is very nice thanks to the giant sandbags in the ocean.

We had a fantastic holiday and had great fun, however we are here to rate the resort NOT how much fun we had. The first disappointment we had at this resort was that it is NOT on the beach. I knew this going in and would never choose to do this again. It has nothing to do with being lazy or anything like that; my spouse and I are huge hikers so the little trot to the beach was no big deal. What I did miss was walking on the beach after dinner, or lying in a beach chair listening to the surf crash in as you gaze up at the stars. The gate to beach is locked at night and after a tiring day shopping or out doing excursions we found we just didn't want to bother with the walk down if we were short on time or energy. The second disappointment was the food; I found the main buffet ok. Lunch at the pool buffet I found it very below the usual standard that I have experienced in similar resorts and the variety of food was not comparable to the others that I stayed. The biggest disappointment of all was the two specialty restaurants. The steak house was like a cheap Ponderosa type steak house. The steak was small and thin, the pork ribs all fat, then to top it off served with instant mashed potatoes?? The Bamboo Asian - Why is it a specialty restaurant when it really is a Chinese buffet? The food was average at best. We stayed at the Grand Palladium in the Mayan 2 years ago and their specialty restaurants where awesome. The Asian food was chopped and cooked right in front of us and the chef was highly entertaining chopping & tossing veggies 3 feet into the air. In the end no comparison, Good thing Playa was close, we went into town twice for dinner so we could have a special meal and we had one of the best steak dinners ever.

Hairdryer,iron and ironing board.The grounds and pools are fantastic,always plenty of comfy sunbeds and brollies.The service from everyone was great and they work very hard.The wildlife was also good for me being an animal lover and there were much to my joy very few bugs.We did get bitten by mozzies a few times but more so on our day at xel-Ha than at the hotel but take mozzie spray all the same.The nightclub was also ok for a few drunken hours after the regular bars close however the sports bar is open 24hrs.The only downside for me and it really wasn't that bad was the food.There was so much choice and we never went hungry but there are only so many buffets i want regardless of how good or bad it is! There was def something to eat for everyone and breakfasts were v good but i think i am overly fussy even in the uk.We did book the Asian speciality restaurant one night and were v dissapointed,to be honest the normal buffet restaurant was better.The only other thing that i would have preferred was although the evening entertainment was 10 for effort i am not really into watching shows every night but it didn't make much difference we just drank at the bar and if we did fancy a change we went into playa for the night.We will def be going back to this hotel and the area was very clean and safe.One day i left our safe open with all of our worldy goods in inc jewellery,i pod,mobiles,passports and equivalent to about \u00a3400 in cash,after hearing horror stories in other hotel reviews(not the Tequila) i expected the worst.When i went back to safe i couldn,t open it and panicked,then i saw a note from security saying our safe had been found open and blocked so report to reception,my heart was pounding as i did this only to find a complete log of all of our possessions thankfully.Security later came and unblocked the safe and cross checked all the items with us.I got a telling off but was very impressed with their honesty esp considering what they earn.This really is all inc and the only money you will need is for tips and trips oh and exit tax.I also would normally book beachfront hotels but it was not a hassle at all to walk 5 mins or so or get the buggy and well worth it as the beach and water were georgous.I could go on and on but just book it you'll have a great time.Feel free to ask me any questions.", "Date": "November 30, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto", "Title": "\u201cGreat place to stay - excellent value for money!\u201d", "Author": "odys47", "ReviewID": "UR50374778", "Content": "We booked our 2 week holiday at the Riu Tequila based on the Trip Advisor reviews.

Three, we hope, helpful comments for the hotel are as follows: 1) the Mexican restaurant was a disappointment. It is located near the beach and has a wonderful setting for an evening dinner. We only ate there once, however; compared to 4 times at the Bamboo (Japanese) and 2 times at the Lupita (steak). Firstly, the food was at best very average and, in fact, there was better Mexican/Spnish food to be had regulary at the main dining room (the Jalisco); and secondly, the restaurant appears to sit on top of an electrical generator which provides unpleasant diesel fumes for the diners as they eat. 2) there are a lot of people that smoke, mostly British. Sometimes up to 40% of those present wrer smoking. The Bamboo restaurant appeared to be non-smoking and the Lupita had a non-smoking area. But attending the evening entertainment shows was a problem. It seemed that you could not escape people smoking and we ended up going back to our room and not attending any of the shows. At least there should be a non-smoking area, even if there are no non-smoking evening shows. 3) we found the wine provided by the hotel very average and not particularly good. The margarits were also poor and rather weak. Since we do not drink a lot we would have liked better quality, rather than unlimited volumes.

This was our third time at this resort and it was better than ever. The renovations that were done last fall are an awesome improvement. New paint, bedding/curtains, addition to outdoor dining patio, flooring and probably a lot that we didn't notice. Oh, the one other thing we liked was that the washroom in the pool restaurant was moved into a separate building in the pool area so you don't have to walk through the restaurant anymore. We had an issue with a loud weekend wedding party and when we mentioned it at the front desk they moved us to a quieter building without hesitation. This was perfect for all...the party could continue and we were happy in a quieter spot. The RIU staff were more than accommodating to us. The food was great each day at the buffet with lots of variety and healthy choices available. This is what keeps bringing us back more than anything. We like to eat healthy and enjoy fresh salads, barbequed meat but still have the freedom to try other dishes that might not be quite as light in calories. At the Tequila you can choose how you eat and we love that option. There was always plenty of bottled water in our room each day and the fridge was always stocked with soft drinks and beer. We enjoy the short stroll to the Yuketan's beach area and usually spent most of the day enjoying their services. Lunch there was great and the beach is bigger and better than ever. There is a shuttle for those who prefer not to walk to the beach area and it runs back and forth all day long. The Tequila is only a 30 minute walk or a $5 cab ride into Playa del Carmen and there is no shortage of things to do once in town. We walk everywhere and have never felt uncomfortable with the people or our surroundings. The night life on 5th Ave is very entertaining and safe. The shopping is amazing and the vendors will entertain you with their unique plees to get you into their shops.

As a travel agent I chose our hotel on the good feedback I had previously recieved on this particular hotel. I was a little hesitant at first seen as it is not directly on the beach, but I must say this was not an issue for us at all. We rather enjoyed the short walk or buggy ride to the beach, it really isn't far at all, less than 5 mins walk. Usually I am a total Beach person and never lay around the pool, however the pools are so inviting at the Riu Tequila and the activities all day keep you well entertained, aswell as the swim up bar!! The barman Hulio was fantastic making my friend and I surprise cocktails each day...LOVED IT!!! The entertainments / Animacion Team were excellent, the boys especially... Crazy James & Tony were our favourites, also so friendly and remembered our names from day 1. The girls did not speak very good english so were a little quiet but on stage each night in their shows WOW...I was pleasantly surprised at such professional shows, they are all amazing dancers. I was a little dissapointed that they were miming and there were no live singers but nether the less we still enjoyed the shows. The food was good... I especially enjoyed the lunch buffets, I love seafood and just lived on fresh fish and salads all week long... I also enjoyed the main buffet in the evening so much to choose from, I didnt like to miss out on anything. The a la carte restuarants were not as great as I had imagined, especially the Asian \"Bamboo\", you could hardley call it a la carte when really its just an asian buffet. I found it really lacked something special. My husband enjoyed the Steak House more than anything !! The grounds to the hotel were very well kept and very green and lushcious!! There was lots of wild life which I really enjoyed, I loved the monkey / racoon type creatures, they could be a bit of a pain at meal times lingering around outside the resturants but staff were on top of it when they could be!! The rooms were very clean and the maid left us lovely towell animals each day which was a lot of fun!! The best feature in the room was of course the liquor dispensers which was the main reason we chose a Riu hotel, but I have to say we didnt get as much use out of it as we expected to as usually when we were in the room (which wasn't much) we were trying to soba up for the next event of the day...lol:) All in all a fantastic vacation, I would highly recomend to any age group there is something for everyone.

Check in Upon arriving at the hotel, we were greeted with a cocktail, an envelope and lots of smiles from the staff. Possibly the best check in I have come across! The envelope contained our key, pool towel cards and hotel information. No queuing, just an envelope. We were shown to our room and within ten minutes our bags followed. Absolutely superb service! Rooms Spacious, comfortable, nicely decorated and furnished and probably most importantly clean. The beds were large (2 doubles put together) and very comfortable. The maids were meticulous and believe me I have a very keen eye when it comes to cleanliness. They also left a different cute towel animal every day. Food After the 1st meal, I was not hungry again for the rest of the holiday. The buffet had a huge range of choice every night including Mexican, Italian, carvery, show cooking and a wide selection of other European foods. Alternatively, the Steak House offered superb meals and the Asian restaurant was also very nice. We did not go to the Mexican restaurant so I cannot comment. The breakfast buffet was almost as large as the evening meal buffet so you could set yourself up for the day easily here. If this wasn\u2019t enough the pool restaurant offered a selection of lunchtime \u2018snacks\u2019 that included burgers, pizza, salad, fish, mini steaks, pasta to name a few as well as having nachos, popcorn and an ice cream machine. As far as drinks go, don\u2019t expect Corona, but the lager is nice. The cocktails are also nice and they do have named spirits such as Smirnoff and Jim Beam. You must try the Miami Vice, it\u2019s lovely! Staff The hotel staff are absolutely superb, especially the PR manager Joseph. He seemed to remember every single guests name and was always willing to have a chat with you, no matter what language you speak. Joseph even arranged a special \u20181st anniversary\u2019 meal for my husband and I. He also arranged for a welcome fruit basket to be left in our room twice throughout our stay. All the bar staff remember what you have to drink (God knows how!), so your glass is never empty. The hotel is always full of life and wherever you look staff are there cleaning, serving etc, but they always have time to smile and say \u2018Ola\u2019. Entertainment Generally I don\u2019t normally like holiday hotel entertainment; however the guys here worked their backsides off day and night to ensure that guests were entertained. We even got chatting to a couple who were staying at the Riu Palace down the road who said they preferred the entertainment at our hotel! During the day there were so many activities you could get involved in (if you wanted to), or you could just relax by the pool and nobody would bother you. Each night the team put on a show which lasted an hour and to be honest I\u2019ve actually paid to see worse shows. After the entertainment ends the nightclub,opens from 11pm until 2am, and it was much better than I imagined it was going to be. There were all ages in there from late teens to 50 + so it created a really nice atomosphere unlike some of the clubs back home. Pool Large, clean, free form pool with swim up bar. Need I say more? Dollars or pesos? Pesos, this is Mexico, not America. You can use either, but personally I preferred to pesos (you get your change in Pesos in any case) and the exchange rate was better at our time of visiting. Weather Does it matter as you can\u2019t do anything about this anyway? It rained quite a bit (about 5 out of 11), but due to everything else on this holiday being so good, this didn\u2019t affect us having a good time one bit. We visited Mexico at the end of October and generally it is supposed to be a good time of year weather - wise, but unfortunately, we caught the back end of a hurricane. However, I suppose we were lucky when you think what could have been... Overall Despite the weather, my husband and I both maintain this is the best holiday we have ever been on (we honeymooned in Las Vegas and Florida last year!), so we are already looking to book to go back next year. I would definitely recommended the Clubhotel Riu Tequila to anyone planning to visit Mexico.

I finally decided to write one because like many others, before booking a trip I always check Trip Advisor to get a sense of other people's experiences. This was our third stay at the Tequila. We decided to go back because the first time we went to Mexico we had a wonderful time here and celebrated our 10th anniversary during that stay. This year we celebrated our 20th anniversary and decided we'd like to return the Tequila to celebrate it there. We were also excited to see what renovations had been done last fall. We were not disappointed. All the furniture in the rooms is new. The safes have been replaced with electronic ones and a Sports Bar was added. About two weeks prior to our departure I emailed to request a room in one of the first three buildings closest to the lobby and mentioned that this would be our third visit and that we were celebrating our anniversary. Upon arrival we were given a room in one of the buildings in the location I had requested and shortly after checking in, a plate of fruit with a congratulatory note from management was delivered to our room. The staff, from reception to groundskeepers, were just as friendly as we had experienced on our previous two stays. The staff does a wonderful job of keeping the rooms and resort clean and the maid provided us with cute towel figures. There's a mini fridge in the room that is restocked every other day and a mini bar. Whenever I left a note requesting particular items for the fridge, it was always met. While the food may not be considered gourmet, it is certainly very good, with plenty of choices. The lunch menu is more limited but with enough choices. The pool is big with a swim-up bar and jacuzzi. It's a little bit of walk to the beach but depending on our moods, instead of walking the pretty path, we sometimes took the golf cart which runs about every 15 minutes. As with other beaches in the area, the Yucatan and Playacar beaches have a few sandbags to prevent further erosion by Mother Nature but they are fewer than on alot of the other beaches and their beaches are in better shape than some of the others. There are nightly shows but we only saw the Halloween show which was very good and the Maya show which was interesting. We did not take any tours or excursions as we have been to Mexico before and our intent was relaxation. We love the Playacar area and Playa del Carmen and keep coming back every chance we can. I would certainly recommend this resort to our friends and family. I feel I should also mention that if anyone needs to make arrangements for airport transfers, I highly recommend USA Transfers. Our connecting flight from Miami to Cancun was delayed 2 1/2 hours. I called to let them know. No problem.

I bought a diet pepsi from the shop, drank half and put it in the mini bar and the next day the maid took out all the pepsi and refilled it with diet pepsi. That was brilliant I couldn't believe it. there is also a liquer cabinet in the room with 2 different tequila's , vodka and rum I think. The grounds was lovely and neat. The gardeners shook the coconut trees to get the loose ones off and cracked them open and gave them people walking past. There was 2 iguanas that lived in the shrubs next to the pool and some strange looking monkey things that walked around all day and tried to pinch food, they looked like racoons but was part of the monkey family. Very cute and people fed them even though you wasn't ment to. The swimming pool was gorgeous and I spent most of my time in the pool bar.The staff squirt you with cold water when your not looking. They have a good laugh with everyone. All the kids there enjoyed it. The entertainment staff loved the kids. They never stopped all day. Even at night when the parents were watching the shows the kids entertainment staff would be sat with them at their tables. The Michael Jackson tribute night was fantastic. The food was gorgeous. It was similar everyday but there was so much to choose from you could eat something different everyday. There is also a Japanese/chinese restaurant which I didnt try but was told it was very nice, a steak house (nicest steak ive ever had) and a mexican restaurant that was nice. It was my wedding anniversary while I was there and in our room we had a 3 tier cake, elephant, and swans all made out of towels, a mayan pyramid ornament and a plate of fruit and they booked us in the steak restaurant again and we had a steak and seafood platter that wasnt on the menu. Playa del carmen was 5 mins away by car and only cost 5 US dollors, about \u00a32.50. I would advise you to take mexican peso's instead of US dollors because you get more for your money and if you pay with dollors sometimes you get half peso's and half dollors for your change which gets confusing.

It was our first trip to Mexico and all inclusive in general and we were thoroughly impressed. The staff was very friendly, always saying \"Hola\" when you were walking around the resort. The entertainment staff was very active and great with getting visitors involved. The rooms were clean and nice but the beds were a little on the hard side but I found this same thing in Dominican. The food was incredible!!! We had access to the Yucatan and Playacar which were the 2 resorts across the street which were equally amazing and we spent most of our days there because they were on the beach. The staff at those resorts were even more active and had us all up learning how to salsa and play games. There were not many young children at these resorts and would be a great place to go as a couple or with family. These resorts didn't have many teenagers as well so I wouldn't necessarily recommend them as \"party\" resorts. This hotel is pretty close to downtown playa del carmen which has some great shopping which is totally worth taking a visit to--only a cheap taxi ride to get there! We did a jungle like trip the one day where we got to snorkel, go in caves, have a home made mexican meal, etc. which was fantastic. This resort is right across form the other 2 resorts, the tequila is not on the beach but is literally a short walk to.

Hotel, the grounds, rooms and general areas are of a really high standard. Rooms have recently been re modelled and everything is very clean and well kept .The furniture is dark wood but very nice.The beds are 2 four feet ones pushed together. There are four spirits in optics in the rooms, which are replaced every two days. These were, Vodka, Rum, Tequila and Gin. Also the bottled beer is re stocked every second day and there is a variety of soft drinks in the fridge along with bottled water Our room was cleaned everyday and towels were also changed daily. Beds changed every other day, towel art is usually left too. There is even an umberella in the room to use if it does happen to rain, how thoughtful is that? The food in all of the eateries are of good standarrd. We ate in the Steakhouse three times and in the Asian once. We did manage to book a table whenever we wanted one, no problems. (some people have previously said they had problems booking these). One thing I would say is people feeding the animals which hang around the garden areas: can be bit of a pest, and they try and invade the Lupita restaurant as a result. There are notices to not feed animals but , of course people dont listen. The animation team are briliiant, (look out for crazy James) the waiters, bar staff, gardeners, cleaners are all very helpful and cannot do enough for you. The hotel is not far from Playa Del Carmen only a few pounds in a taxi gets you there. We also went to Cozumel island twice (its very easy to get the ferry over) we hired a jeep for the day. It was a bit of a wreck but that said, most looked like that. We also went to Xcaret for the day, again close to the hotel. We did the 1.5 mile underground river swim, and also the optional ($50) Snuba dive which was brilliant, just the same as Scuba but the tanks are on the surface whilst you dive via airline and mouthpiece. It was worth every penny and you are down on the reeef for about 20 to 25 minutes. We had a wonderful holiday and we did a bit of relaxing and enjoyed every minute. I have to say I thought we might get bored, but we weren't. This was not the case at all. There were a lot of arranged activities throughout the day and evening. The stage shows were also of a good standard. We would without hesitation recommend going to this hotel, it's not directly on the beach but you can catch the golf type buggy from the front of the hotel, and it only takes a couple of minutes to get there. If you walked it would only take five minutes. Lastly, the money debate, Pesos or Dollars? We would recommend Pesos, usually everything is dual marked but sometimes if you paid in USD, you got Pesos change and with a wee swing in their favour as far as exchange rate goes. Departure tax payable at the airport was either, 515 Pesos, $43 or 28Euros. This must be paid in cash and despite our travel agent advice, a combination of the currencies is fine.

We are used to having people push us away from our bags so they can get them. A little miffed, but we moved on. The room was nice. TV's are still old. bathroom and shower were nice.

The steak and sushi places were fine....not great, but fine. The mexican restaurant is actually over at the Riu Yucatan. Not really worth the walk in our opinion. The beach was tremendous. The \"whales\" are kind of an eyesore, but serve a purpose. We loved the sand and the volleyball everyday. Got our drinks at the Yucatan for the most part. We are beach lovers, and the beaches are excellent in that area. Reminds us of pre wilma beaches in Cancun. Loved the entertainment staff. pools were good. 80% euro's there. We fit right in though. Beaches probably 50% topless. Loved the jungle feel to the Tequila, and the walk to the beach was not bad at all. In fact, we liked all the walking we did, as it worked off some of the food and drink. The gym to work out is also at the Yucatan. We did one day. Its alright. Not a lot of equipment, but enough to get a good workout or run in. All in all, we would go back to the Tequila. We actually are going back in december.

Third time in Mexico but first at the Tequila. Arrived at the hotel and everything we need was waiting for us our room keys, towel cards and info aswell as a much needed cool drink! After a quick tour of where the eating areas were we were pointed in the direction of our room. Rooms are very spacious with 2 double beds, dresser, large wardrobe with safe, bathroom, shower area and balcony. The air con worked well but we always left the fan on too to make sure the room was extra cool. The maids did a god job of cleaning the room each day and leaving us lovely towel art, we got a few giggles!! The hotel itself is very well kept, grounds are in great condition you always see someone attending to something. The pool areas are clean and you could always get a lounger we our specific loungers we liked to use everyday and always got them even if we were up later. Food is good, the steak restaurant was our favourite, the Mexican wasn\u2019t really Mexican food but was still good, the bamboo restaurant the sushi was good but we weren\u2019t so keen on the mains. You use the same buffet for breakfast and dinner and a different one for lunch always lots of selection. The waiter staff were all so friendly and provided great service. Drinks were good the cocktails are amazing you have to try the banana mama, again bar staff were brilliant in the evenings we didn\u2019t even have to order our drinks they would be waiting for us as we approached the bar!! The entertainment team were top class and do a fab job, special mention to Super Tony, Crazy James, Eder, Aden, Nemo, Rene, Emilio, Pablo, Carolina, Sergio and Alfredo get to know them they will make your holiday a blast. They provide the activities all day you can choose from shooting, bowls, horseshoes, aerobics, darts, volleyball, water polo, water basketball, step aerobics, bingo, etc. They then also do the evening shows too which are good the best ones are mama mia and grease. The external shows are not so good as the staff shows but alright. Be warned before the main show each night they do an audience participation show so be prepared to be dragged up on stage to make a fool of yourself! Before this they do a kids disco at 8.30 each night you have to watch it its so cute but you will end up humming the songs to yourself and doing the dances. We went into playa del carmen most nights with some of the entertainment team, coco bongos is a good night, senior frogs you get the best cocktails, coco maya the best music, dubai is alright to. We went on 2 trips the speedboat and snorkelling with turtles and the catamaran, both booked through fat cat and both were really good trips and we would recommend you do them through fat cat. The beach is gorgeous its only a short walk from the hotel and its a nice walk, if you want you can also take a buggie to the beach but it is only a 5 min walk. The beach in playa del carmen is lovely too and its only a 25 min walk or $5 in a taxi, from the beach you can see the island of cozumel.

While not the islands it was still on the Caribbean which suited us fine. I didn't really know what to expect given the price, but boy were we pleasantly surprised. The grounds and resort itself are extremely well kept. You can see workers at all times of day grooming the grounds and cleaning the resort. The room, well, it was 4 star caliber - all newly remodeled and just as comfortable as can be with alcohol restocked every other day. Get second floor if you can for the high ceilings and balcony. I won't go into grand detail since it's stated on most of the reviews, but the all-inclusive deal is well worth the money. The food, while not amazing, is more than fine and you can generally find fresh fish, fruits and ice-creams. The Mexican food is very good, we ate that most nights. The sushi is just okay but we're from New York and have access to good sushi. The staff is very attentive in the restaurants and they deserve a tip!!! No one tips here - must be the euro thing. Grab Johnny Walker's and beers and you don't have to worry about the limited alcohol mixed drinks. Sports Bar food is terrible - cold burgers and nachos - avoid unless desperate. You've heard it in other reviews - nice short walk to the beach. We enjoyed the walk as it helped exercise some of the food off and never really took the shuttle. The beach is average in front of the resort with the sand whales everywhere and very crowded - good for people watching and topless ladies, lots of hoohah's here, if you're into that. My advice - walk down the beach to the right and there will be no one around. No sand whales and just a lovely stretch of beach which is excellent for swimming. It's your own little private paradise. Do the Whale Shark dive if you're there in the right season!!! It was simply amazing to be swimming with these huge animals. The dives off the beach are just okay, nothing special and we didn't do Cazumel so I can't speak to that. We skipped Tulum and instead went to Coba - which is awesome. Take the local bus to get there, though. Tours will charge you over a hundred and you can take the local bus for $14 each round trip and get the exact same experience. Hire a dude to bike you - very knowledgable and the walk to the main temple is looooog. Massages were very good, though a little weird since they are right off the pool. Dive shop is very knowledgeable. Other than that, the place is great. Not really a romantic getaway kind of place. They have karaoke and kids entertainment every night. There are lots of kids, but you can avoid them. If you like big all-inclusive resorts, you will love this place. You can eat right off the beach at the sister resort.

However sadly, we were very disappointed. I am also shocked at how over-hyped and completely over-rated this hotel comes across on this site! There are way too many over the top excessive reviews on this site, I think perhaps people get confused between a good holiday in Mexico and a bad hotel! Having stayed in Platinum hotels before, we knew what to expect and this hotel simply didn't have it and left us slightly bemused! considering a non-platinum hotel but with platinum prices. The things that make the hotel great are its grounds which are imaculately kept and maintained and the abundance of wildlife that can be seen, even from your bedroom window/balcony, I believe the racoon/meerkat type animals with the long tails were acoutis. The beach, weather and the trips we took were the only things we enjoyed, unfortunately. The beach itself was lovely, typical Caribbean beach, palm trees and blue water, the sandbags made no difference and the sea was safe to swim in. We recommend the Captain Hook boat dinner cruise, best night of our holiday, also made us see how shabby and amatureish the hotel entertainment was (more on that later!). This is definetly not 5 star, and it shouldn't feature in the Platinum brochure as we have been to other hotels from the brochure which don't even compare to this hotel! More like 3 star and upwards perhaps. The rooms were ok for sleeping in, but aside from that the bathroom was dark and dingey, and needed more lighting and the toilet area was far too small (I'm not fat, but I can imagine some larger guests may have difficulties here). The mini bar whilst always fully stocked, didn't contain any food/snacks as we have found as standard in other all inclusive hotels elsewhere. We also noticed the absence of any stationary in the rooms which also comes as standard in other hotels, yet this is a '5 star' hotel? Questionable. Not that it matters much, but the TV had at a push, just 2 or 3 English speaking channels, again, quite surprising for a 5 star hotel, and an international hotel chain. A satellite dish can't cost that much? It would have been nice to have some English music channels to get ready for dinner to, or even US music channels - not far away! The worst part of the holiday was the food and drink, especially as it is all inclusive, oh no, sorry it says 24 hour all inclusive. Just be warned, that 24 hour all inclusive may sound glossy and attractive, in reality, if you arrived at say 2/3am from the airport, the 24 hour food/drink is simply hot dogs, burgers and crisps and cartons of fruit. Very poor in my experience, especially for a 5 star hotel. If that wasnt enough, you cook your own food in the microwaves provided?! Add to this that the Sports Bar area where this is served is swarming with loud teenagers....sigh. Breakfast and lunch were very limited, same choices every day, which was disappointing for an all inclusive hotel especially the price we paid, poor value for money. Dinner was also very limited, I fail to see where the rave, hyped up reviews come from saying the food was excellent - it was nothing of the sort. OK it may have looked nice and been ok to eat, but nothing special and we've had much better elsewhere! On the same theme, the service in the restaurants was poor, some nights they wouldn't even bother serving you at all! On busy nights they seemed very flustered and panicked. Staff overall were again, nothing to shout about in the slightest! Most staff would offer a greeting around the grounds, but the waiting staff in the restaurant were never overly excited or happy and never went out of the way to do anything. Similarly the entertainment staff lacked any serious charisma and personality, never encouraged or engaged anyone around the pool very well. Entertainment in general is what you can expect, Butlins style miming, but what surprised me was the entertainment 'team' didn't even bother to produce their own shows!? What they do all day and get paid for is beyond me, the shows were poor, samey and focused on crude games and singing and dancing. Hardly original or funny, just tired jokes and cliches. Overall, please don't believe the hype hyped up reviews on this site, this is not a 5* star hotel and never will be until serious changes are implemented. If you've stayed in a Thomson Platinum hotel you'll know the real standard of 5* star all inclusive hotels and will know what to expect, just don't expect that here, because you'll be bitterly disappointed.

Was only there for 1 week, and went with my best friend for her 30th Birthday. This was a bit of a last minute booking and the price we paid was good, we did take spending money with us as we were not sure what standard to expect for the price we had paid. However, the ony money we spent was on excursions. The staff in the hotel go out of their way for you - ChaCha in the restaurants is fantastic and organised 2 parties for my friend (including 2 cakes, fresh flowers etc etc all for free) every day in our room our towels had been folded in to something cute, such as an elephant, child or swan - even a huge 4 tier birthday cake complete with flowers (tissues) and roses... The weather was lovely, the staff work very hard considering the heat. They run everywhere and nothing is a problem for them. The hotel was at this time of year (September) predominantly European, lots of Spanish and Mexican in groups, but overall it was peaceful if you wanted peace, and noisy if you wanted noise. We tended to be up early every day and sleep around the pool before heading for the late sittings in the restauarant and staying up till 3 or 4ish - there was always plenty of people milling around at this time. The restaurants were lovely, however, you do have to be up at the crack of dawn to get first choice of the restaurants. The beach club has a lovely setting but the food is quite poor - not very mexican at all (steak and chicken). Anyone who likes asian food will love the Bamboo - the sushi is amazing!! There is a lot of choice in the buffet restaurant, ranging from Fajitas (different every day, pork, shrimp, squid etc) various fresh pizzas, bbq'd ribs, roast chickens etc etc - something for everyone. There was also a fish dish every day, the salad bars are huge and the fresh fruit and homemade ice-cream are delish.... Whilst there we went on a dolphin swim. Due to current tourism levels we got a good deal from Discovery Cove (booked via the Thomson rep) $199 for the premium package which inluded a royal swim with the dolphins, swimm with the manatees and the sea lions. Definitely worth doing as a once in a lifetime experience - this is one of the only places that offers the manatee and sea lion programme. Be prepared that you do get stung for the photos and videos once you have done it (we paid $230 for photos and videos). As we booked the dolphin trip we got an offer of a $50 voucher each off another trip which we used for the Jungle ATV tour which was AMAZING!!! a definite experience which we ended up only paying $25 for. 2 hours on a quad bike each up through to the thick of the jungle where we parked up anf trekked my foot for 5 minutes until we came to some natural caves and cenotes which we could dive in to. Such an experience - if I ever go to Mexico again I would do this trip in the blink of an eye!!! We did sample the spa however, we walked across the road to the Riu Yucatan as we could get an offer (buy one pedi get one for free - $42 for both of us) - very relaxing but not the best pedicure in the world... nice tho! hotel is in a very safe and private location, in a gated community with another 3 Riu hotels (Playacar, Princess and Yucatan) all within a few mins walk of each other. There is a small set of shops just along the road (3 minutes walk) which includes a pharmacy and a starbucks...

The hotel is ideally situated in a very safe environment there is a small shopping area about 5 minutes walk from the hotel, and for serious shopping there's 5th Avenue which is a 5 dollar cab ride away, the hotel had every amenity that you could possibly need or want, what I liked best was, before leaving for my holiday I had read reviews and the comments made by other people and most have said that the staff are friendly, helpful and always smiling and they were right the staff could'nt do enough for you, the rooms were very clean, large and airy 2 very comfortable double beds, bedding was changed every 2 days clean towels every day, the room had excellent air conditioning with a large balcony , the main restaurant was large the staff there again gave an excellent service before you had sat down for breakfast the staff were there with your pots of tea and coffee at evening meals you were seated by a member of staff, who I must say made a big fuss of any child you had in your party, again before you had drained the last drop of your drink another was placed in front of you, we tried he Steak House which gets booked up very quickly again the staff gave an excellent service, we loved the swimming pools especially the one with the swim up bar, by the our 2nd day the bar staff knew what our favorite drinks were and quickly had them made up for you, the hotel's entertainment staff done an extremely good job making sure that nobody ever felt left out, the evening shows were very good especially \"The Michael Jackson Tribute Show\" this is one show you should not miss, the one thing that I did not like was we were told by our holiday reps not to use outside agents for any trips we wanted to go on but after seeing the reps price's, we had chosen 3 trips that we wanted to go on the reps were charging 805 dollars for these 3 trips we decided to cancel, after converting the price into sterling nearly (\u00a3600) we went to one of the agents in the local shopping center who gave us an excellent service which cost us lest than half the price with the holiday reps, we were also given his personal mobile number just in case there was a problem (we never had to use it as mini buses turned up on time) the one trip that stands out was the Catamaran trip on the \"Blue Tiger\" I have a fear of deep water and one of the catamaran staff a man called Angel personally took me snorkeling it was an amazing experience he was very patient and helpful, we all had a wonderful trip with an lovely meal and when we returned to dry land our cars were there to whisk us back to our hotels. All in all a fantastic holidays was had by us we will definitely be booking to go back next year, loved the hotel and loved the Mexican people. A perfect place to relax and recuperate. A big thank you to all the staff who made us so welcome especially Lucia our room maid and Joseph head of security who patiently explained the best places to visit and shop.", "Date": "September 24, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "glasgow", "Title": "\u201cDon't go!\u201d", "Author": "gary777", "ReviewID": "UR43078731", "Content": "First impressions of the riu tequila staff made you welcome.

Complained after bird was seen taken fruit from the fruit bowl, bowl was then removed by staff only to be put back out 5 minutes later.Continually saw the birds doing this. In the main resturant at night was very very busy and you had to queue for food.Table cloths and cutlery were not clean and the choice of wines were disgusting. At the bars they gave you silly plastic glasses which had a smell of stale beer and were never cleaned properly. Lots of americans had brought their own cups and glasses with them.

We noted how cheerful and friendly all the staff were, quite literally every single member of staff that you pass walking though the hotel and its grounds will acknowledge you! The rooms are quite nice and farily large, with views over the landscaped gardens and trees, with all the wildlife they contain. Most people seemed, quite like us, amused by the Iguanas, Coatis and Agoutis as well as the colourful birds. The pools are fine, pretty much as you would expect, and although the pool bar can get busy, we never had a problem getting served. in fact the staff work so hard at all the bars to keep you in drinks, they were so friendly with the guests, it would be difficult to single individuals out for praise. Having the 24 hour sports bar was a nice to have, they have a few snack in there like burgers, hotdogs, Pizza or Nachos to heat up if you get the munchies after having a very drinks! The night club only opens 11pm - 2am but we didnt use it as the time difference was taking its toll! The main restaurant has a wide variety of food for breakfast and Dinner. Breakfast has cereal, fresh squeezed juice of different types, porrage, full english, mexican breakfast, continental, french toast, donuts, pancakes, croissants and loads more. Dinner varies by day, but there is always a Mexican station, Show cooking area, main meal station as well as salad bar etc and desserts. Huge amount of choice, you would need to be very very picky to not have a good choice. The quality was very good especially considering the size of the hotel. The real jewel in the crown of meal times are the speciality restaurants. We only tried the asian and Steak restaurants but both were excellent and the service in both was very good too. I had read that you needed to be up real early to have a hope of booking these, but there were often tables left after 9am! If you are travelling from the UK your body clock will be getting you up for5 or 6 am for the first couple of days anyway! So you will have plenty of time! You can use the facilities of a couple of other hotels nearby too, including the beachbar at the Riu Yucatan which is handy. We found it quite nice to visit different bars on a night and it gives you a wider choice of entertainment. The beach is 5 mins walk - or you can get the \"lazy\" golf cart, after all you are on holiday, and its HOT! The beach is wonderful, and we found it a struggle to leave the warm carribean sea at all! There are some quite big Angel fish which will happily eat bread from your hand as well as various other colourful tropical fish - so dont forget your snorkel! They are expensive to buy here. Playacar is a gated resort and is therefore very safe to walk around, you can get a taxi to playa del carmen for \u00a32.50 to shop, although there are a few shops in playacar itself. The hotel was pretty good but made great by the wonderful staff, my only little niggle was the vendors which have stalls in the hotel as you walk for Dinner every other day and the photo company - ok when you want to buy something but some want you to buy everthing! A firm but polite no thanks does tend to do the trick but it can get a bit tedious. A very small niggle which is nit picking really and should serve to show how good everthing else is! A tip would be before you book the trips through the tour operator your travelled with, walk down the road to the shops and speak with the guys at the excursion kiosk, some are almost half price! Also, take Pesos rather than dollars, stuff works out cheaper! Also at least once during your stay get up early and go and watch the beautiful Carribean sunrise. You might catch a glimse of the monkeys that live in the tress on the beach too if you are lucky. If you have booked here you are in for a great time!

Our mood lifted when we arrived at the tequila. We were greeted with a fruity cocktail and showed to our rooms, which were super, large, clean with comfy beds. Iwas a bit concerned about the mosquitoes that maybe lurking in the rooms, but had no problems there. only got bitten once and didn't use sprays or room pug ins! The hotel is fab, from food to drinks....they are all top brands and you can get easily very merry here. Try the mojitoes they are amazing! The pools are lovely,yes they are warm, but i would prefer this to a really cold pool anyday! The beach is absoloutly stunning,it was enough for me just to sit and take in the view of the tuly most beautiful sea i've ever seen! The sand bags don't deter from the beauty at all, infact our daughters loved jumping off them, and it provides safe lagoons to bathe in. Lunch could be taken at the tequila, yucatan or playa car. I would recommend going to the playa car as it was smarter, quieter than the yucatan and there was more choice for lunch, although they insit on shoes and to be covered up! Entertainment was ok we didn't watch it all but some of the shows were great with super dancing whilst others were dire with the cast all miming to the songs! Tried the disco which was lovely and cool and some great music. Only did one trip through a chap called Jesus which was recommended to us through another guest. you can find him turning left out of hotel about 200 yards down the road.....so much cheaper than thomson! Did the tour to Coba which was great climbing to the top but a bit scary coming back down!

There seem to be a million all inclusive hotel options in the Playa Del Carmen area, and after reading the reviews, we decided to go with the Tequila. We were not disappointed! I traveled with my sister on our yearly girls trip, and I've tried to cover all of our observations below. Rooms: They were a very nice size, and it was nice to have the toilet in a separate room from the sink area. It made getting ready much faster! The shower was very clean, although it would have been nice if there was a light in the shower stall, as it seemed kind of dark. The person who came to clean our room did a fantastic job each and every day. We left him a US$2 tip towards the middle of the trip, and the next day we had a towel animal made for us! Let me just point out that the tip did not make him clean better - the room was spotless every day even before the tip. The beds were quite comfortable. My only complaint was that as soon as you open the door to the room, at least a few mosquitos came in with you! It doesn't matter how fast you try and get in and close the door, they seem to make it in. We began using our flip flops as bug killers just because we didn't want to go to sleep knowing there was a mosquito in the room and wake up with bites everywhere. Another note is that when they are cleaning your room, they leave the door wide open, and this is also how they get in. I know it's a tropical environment and it's be be expected, so it wasn't too big of a deal. Pools: The pool area was quite nice and very clean. The water was a touch on the warm side, but I imagine it's got to be difficult to keep the water cool when it's so hot outside! The swim up bar was very nice and quite large. We also used the swim up bar at the Yucatan across the street and they have a section of the pool that is just for the bar with tables and stools in the water. This is a great place for drinking and people watching! No matter which pool you use, there are plenty of shaded areas in case you don't want to constantly be in the sun. Beach: What else can I say - the beach is one of the most beautiful I have ever seen. It's absolutely gorgeous, from the water to the sand to the backdrop of Coumel in the distance. We spent a good part of our trip by the beach - after all, you can always go swimming in a pool, but how ofter do you get to witness the gorgeous site of clear blue ocean? It only takes 10 minutes to walk to the beach from the lobby of the Tequila, but I witnessed firsthand that the golf cart that gives you a ride to the beach comes every 5-10 minutes, just in case you don't want to walk. And, if you are walking and the golf cart goes by and has room, he will ask you if you want a ride the rest of the way! Again, I cannot stress enough how beautiful the ocean water was. Restaurants: The only a la carte restaurant we tried was the Bamboo Asian restaurant. As other posters have mentioned, the fried ice cream for desert was outstanding, and definitely worth ordering. The rest of the food there was good, but I wouldn't go so far as to call it great. It was buffet style, and I think it would be a little more classy if the wait staff took your order. As for the buffets, breakfast was fabulous. They have anything you could possibly want for breakfast, and it was my favorite meal of the day. I was kind of disappointed in the lunch, as there seemed to be the same offerings every day of hamburgers, hot dogs, salad, and some sort of pasta. I kept waiting for them to have something different for lunch than the day before, but it never happened! The dinner buffet had some really great food, and there was plenty to choose from no matter how picky you are with your food. The one disappointment was that there was a lack of shellfish. If you go to the restaurants on 5th Ave, they have a ton of shrimp options, but I believe the only place I saw shrimp offered was at the Bamboo restaurant. A small complaint, but overall, the dinner was very good. Entertainment: We paid attention over the course of our 5 days at the hotel, and it seemed that the entertainment staff was working around the clock! The same person who coordinated the water aerobics in the pool at 9am was in the nightly show at 10pm! Even though they work extremely long hours, they are all so upbeat and fun! I highly recommend that you participate in the water aerobics in the activity pool one morning, just so you can find out how to do the \"baby position\" - it's a great laugh! Bars: All of the bartenders were extremely efficient. It's amazing to me that there were only 2 bartenders working the entire swim up bar - there was a constant flow of people there and they never stopped pouring drinks! We brought our 34 ounce Bubba Kegs with us in our suitcases, just so we wouldn't have to use the small glasses that are usually given at all inclusives. I highly recommend this - Our mugs kept our drinks cold for over 2 hours on the hot beach in the sun. This is still amazing to us and great so that you don't have to keep getting up and going to the bar for a refill. During the day, there were a ton of bees by the bars, due to all of the fruity drinks that are being served. They didn't seem to be stinging, they were just more annoying than anything else. And the most important thing to point out about the bars - they were very generous with the alcohol! As other reviewers have pointed out, do try a \"Tequila Boom Boom.\" It's a nice little twist to having a tequila shot! Outside Hotel: One day we took a cab to 5th Avenue in Playa del Carmen to do some shopping. Please note that a cab ride back and forth into town is US$5, no matter where you catch a cab along 5th Ave. It's definitely worth it, especially if you have shopping bags! You can walk to town in about 1/2 hour, and you do pass some nice vacation homes on the way, but if you want to save your energy, then I would recommend a cab. 5th Ave is quite a long strip of shopping and bars! We had appetizers at a few of the restaurants along the way and all were good. Be sure to go to the place where you can sit on a swing as you sit by the bar and watch the goings on along 5th Ave! I highly recommed you spend an afternoon or evening in town - it's quite built up and seemed very safe, with many fun things to see and do! Overall, I would recommend the Tequila for anyone looking for a fun vacation with lots of activity. The location of the hotel is top notch, with a beautiful beach and close to the heart of Playa del Carmen. The hotel staff from the people at the front desk to the wait staff, to the entertainment staff were all outstanding. The location is oustanding. What else can I say?

Some of the animation team had been there for 6yrs, this just goes to show that they take their job seriously.

The beach is fantastic, only a short walk or golf cart ride away. We did Dolphin Discovery which was great although the photos are pricey. My husband and 16yr old swam with Whale sharks which we booked through a tour guide just outside the hotel which was alot cheaper, they had a fantastic once in a lifetime encounter with the Whale sharks. We really cant wait to return, no its not a 5 star boutique hotel with cordon bleu food, but its fantastic, friendly, clean and the staff work so hard to ensure your holiday is fab.

Ive read that other people have said the staff are very friendly and they cant do enough for you!? Well yes, they are friendly when you approach them or they start talking to you but really you just get on with your holiday and sort problems out yourself, they don\u2019t go out of their way to do anything unless you ask!! on the trips/excursions we booked as a family they were AMAZING! i enjoyed all of them so much and it was good to get away from the hotel and beach a bit. recommend all the ones we went on; chichen itza, captain hook, fat cat catamaran, xcaret and swimming with dolphins, all good experiences, we loved captain hook and swimming with dolphins. they try and get you involved with all the games etc on captain hook, i got picked and it was good fun. chichen itza was good if you like finding out about the culture although it was a long journey and very hot but still worth it. met some really nice people on all the trips. i dont want to sound hard to please, because im not, or to put people off considering staying here but it has to be said after all the comments which have been put on here about it being 'amazing'. afterall it is my opinion if not the truth. and if you had stayed at other hotels true to 5*, you would probably think the same about this hotel. it makes alot of difference if its on the beach or not, so with this in mind how is it still 4/5* standard? we had such an amazing time in mexico but the hotel was just disappointing. the hotel has average standards but if you had experienced other hotels like me you have an idea of what to expect in others you visit and it really wasnt as i would have thought. yes, all hotels are different and you're not staying at a top class one, but are you for real to think its great and to come back again?! some people have stayed here three times? are you seriously talking about the same hotel? like another person has said, i dread to think what a 2* thomson hotel is!!", "Date": "September 3, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Milton Keynes, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cTop Hotel & Resort\u201d", "Author": "BUTTERS84", "ReviewID": "UR39647181", "Content": "This Hotel is great, plenty to do and see, a bit of a walk to the beach but a free shuttle is run by the hotel.

Loads of sunbeds, free bar and food less than 10 seconds off the sand, free snorkels, pedelos and kayaks. The much talked about sandbags that look like whales are great fun for the kids to dive off, ours spent hours on them. Animals on the beach were monkeys and iguanas as well as a whole range of birds. NIGHTTIME ENTERTAINMENT OK now this was the only bit we have a less than perfect score on! The shows were OK, some were very good.

So if you didn't want to see the show (and 14 in a row was a bit much) you had a choice of leaving the complex or going to the indoor sports bar which attracted all the young kids so not too relaxing! Opening the pool bar at night would have given another choice. BUGS Don't believe the hype! No worse than any warm country. I got bitten a couple of times but the kids not once between the 4 of them. TRIPS We did a couple of trips with FAT CAT booked via the rep. A half day on a catamaran and another on a RIB. Brilliant! Swam with sea turtles, tons of fish, great lagoons and blasting along the sea. Would do both again given the chance. SO..... In summary, a brilliant holiday made better by excellent staff. We would go back to a Riu hotel again no question.", "Date": "September 3, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wyoming", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful Place, Beautiful People, Wonderful Time\u201d", "Author": "LillyJo", "ReviewID": "UR39632137", "Content": "This hotel is beautiful and the staff are so helpful, giving, and humble.

I enjoyed the food, it was amazing. Theres so much food! You will not go hungry or thirsty there. I liked everything! I tried to tip as much as possible and it made them happy and I was glad to do it even though I didn't have to because they gave so much. They deserved it. Fun! This was the perfect place to wind my summer up. I hope we get to go again soon! The room was beautiful and spacious clean and comfortable and secure.

The hotel is beautiful, very clean with hard-working, friendly staff. The food is amazing, with a choice of Asian, Mexican and Steakhouse a la carte restaurants. However we stuck with the main buffet restaurant as there was so much choice, we never got bored! Dont miss barbecue night, the food is lovely! There are 2 pools; one mainly for the entertainment team to play volleyball, etc with the guests and a quieter pool with swim-up bar. Both were a good size and never over crowded. There are ample sunbeds at both the beach and pool with lots of shade available. Rooms are clean spacious with the added extra of all inclusive optics in the bathroom! The maids also make great towel animals! There is a different show every evening, which were not once repeated in our 2 week stay; the Michael Jackson show is a must-see. The entertainment team are good fun and there are loads of daytime activities to choose from, but you are not pestered to take part if its not your thing. The staff as a whole are very friendly and most speak excellent English, although we tried our best to speak Spanish when possible. If you want to get away from the resort, you can walk 20mins (or a few mins taxi) to 5th Avenue- a very long stretch of bars, restaurants and shops. Mexico is quite expensive for buying souvenirs so if there are no prices, dont be afraid to barter! There is a wide variety of trips available, however again these are expensive through the tour operator. They were each roughly around US$95. We did three trips during our two-week stay. The first was Chichen Itza; a long day but well worth it to see a wonder of the world. It was a 3 hour journey each way but the coach journey included all-inclusive drinks and snacks. We stopped at a cenote where you can take a dip and cool off. We had an excellent guide around Chichen Itza who was very knowledgeable. This was also the best place for cheap souvenirs! The second trip was the Fat Cat Catamaran snorkelling tour. Although im not keen on boats or snorkelling, this was my favourite trip! Again all drinks and packed lunch were included. We stopped at a reef to snorkel before lunch, then after lunch you can float in a bay in your lifejacket drinking cans of beer! Great fun and again we were very well looked after. Finally we went to Captain Hooks dinner show, where you sail around a bay in a pirate galleon, enjoying a dinner show which involves sword fighting, pirates swinging between the galleons and all sorts of fun and games. Again its all-inclusive food and drinks with great facilities and service. So although the trips were expensive, they always felt like they were worth the money. Finally, I forgot to mention the beach which is a few minutes walk (or golf buggy ride) from the hotel. The sand is white and powdery, it is very clean and the sea is crystal clear with lots of watersports for those who want to be active. Also dont forget to feed the fish, there are massive angel fish which jump out of the water for a snack! An unforgettable holiday. I never go back to the same place twice, but Im already planning a return visit!", "Date": "August 30, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "northampton", "Title": "\u201cgood one\u201d", "Author": "galaxy17", "ReviewID": "UR39122927", "Content": "My family and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Tequila. The Pools were excellent, becuase of only one depth in one of the pools we did not have to worry about the children to much. [I wish other hotels would do the same] Food was of good standard. Breakfast was good, with eggs been done every way you wanted them, and if you could not see what you wanted all you had to do was ask the chef at that work station to cook eggs how you wanted.{not difficult] plenty of choice with fresh meats fruits cheeses and a smoothie bar? Pool lunch bar was open from about 10.30am till early evening, the choice of food wasn't great, but something to suit all tastes but with tea/coffee availible all day with fresh deserts being supplied all day as well as fresh fruit. Personally found this better than having to que for a scone? Evening meals were varried as long as you were willing to try something new but still the traditional favourites out every night with plenty of meats and fish selections something for every ones taste. If you preferred something else all you had to do was to request it. Sports bar pretty much disigned for fast food eaters ie. teenagers but still it was nice and cool in there which was a wellcome relief when waiting for our transfer to the airport. The rooms were kept clean with the mini bar replemished every other day. The entertainment was good although not great, but was excellent for us to have a relaxing drink and watch something light with the children joining in on some shows. The entertainment team were excellent and did not bother you to much if you did not want to join in, did not feel any pressure from them at all [Well done]. The staff were always friendly with a special thanks to Frank at reception and Ventura in the restruant. If there was any difficulties with the rooms or anything else all you had to do was report it to reception and someone would be along to fix it with in minutes. The arguement of what sort of star hotel this is, is a nonsence, the grounds of the hotel are beautiful and relaxing, the staff are happy and helpfull, the food of a good standard, the rooms kept clean?

This has been one of our best holidays ever not just where it is but you can not fault this hotel in anyway. The staff at this hotel were so friendly and helpful nothing is too much trouble, bar staff had your drinks waiting for you after you had been to the bar once which my husband loved! the food is so good, be prepared to put on weight as you have to go up for more its that nice, food catered for everyone including children including ice cream, popcorn,and nachos available all day long, loved the swim up bar and its really big so you can just sit there for ages without the worry of others getting to the bar. Evening entainment is good and the hotel puts on different theme nights each evening and there is no pressure on you to join any games through the day. The walk to the beach is about 5 mins down a walkway which is a nice little stroll but if you want you can catch the shuttle, when you are on the beach don't worry about the sandbags once you have seen them you tend to take no notice of them, just don't climb on them, plenty of sunbed on the beach as well (you don't need to pay for them) its nice to walk on sand that doesn't get hot! no more burnt toes. The walk to 5th ave is about 20-30 mins but worth the walk loads of shbut you need to just be able to say no when people are trying to sell you things, but just remember its their job, its a really safe walk down one road from the hotel. well to anyone going and staying at this hotel I promise you that you will have a lovely time and will want to go again, we have booked up to go back next year with our children this time and we only got back 1 day ago.", "Date": "August 25, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kent", "Title": "\u201cPerfect for all age groups.\u201d", "Author": "riutequila", "ReviewID": "UR38633954", "Content": "We went there to get married and had an amazing time.

I travelled with my aunt, uncle and cousin for two weeks at the end of June and wasn't sure what to expect when I got there! Unfortunately it was raining when we got there, so to see it in its full light was not possible... The rooms: well the rooms are lovely, spacious and very clean. Two double beds joined together, so it made the bed huge, with me and my cousin sleeping at either side of the bed, we probably could have fitted another 3 people in-between us. There was plenty of storage space for clothes and shoes (two girls, we certainly needed it with all our clothes). Bathroom was great, really big mirror by the sink (also needed for 2 girls), mini fridge with soft drinks and beer in there at no extra cost. And the bonus in the room is you get optics (vodka, rum, tequila and gin). The only thing I didn\u2019t like about the bathroom was that the shower was quite dark, so we got around this by just closing the curtain to the bathroom while one of us was in the shower. The rooms were cleaned everyday and you could get clean towels everyday if you wanted to. If you tipped the cleaner as well, he would make animal towels for you... which we tried to keep, but I think he worked out what we were doing! The Hotel surroundings and pool: this was like something you have to see to appreciate how nice it is. The walk from reception to the room is really nice, pathways with trees and plants the whole way along. We often walked along at night from the reception to our room after we had been out at night, and could feel very safe walking, the only thing that scared me was the coati mundi\u2019s chasing me trying to get my food!... I tried not to wake people up screaming! Then there is the pool, two very spacious pools set amongst the trees with plenty of free sun beds. In the middle of the two pools was the Lupita restaurant, which served lunch during the day, and a restaurant at night. Here you could go help yourself to fresh hot food from 12-6 and drinks from any time of the day until 6, they even have a beer pump and wine that you can help yourself to. On one side of the pool it\u2019s more relaxing with the swim up bar, and sun beds in the pool. Then on the other side there was more activities going on throughout the day. Food: Whether you are a fussy eater or like experimenting with what you eat, you will not be disappointed, there is something for everyone! There is the main restaurant in the main building with a buffet. My fear before I went was that there wasn\u2019t going to be a lot that I liked. But there was so much choice, from your English, Italian, Mexican, and quite often they had a BBQ outside with steaks, chicken and ribs. There is also a huge selection of fresh fruit and salad for anyone who wants to be really healthy on holiday! The waiters in the restaurant couldn\u2019t be any more helpful if they tried. They will show you to a table and get your drinks for you. The main restaurant also is where you go for breakfast in the morning; they serve everything from cereal to full English breakfast. Help yourself to as much as you like; they also make omelettes for you with what you want in them. There are then the a la carte restaurants that you can go to in the evenings, three of them in total. There is the Steakhouse (Lupita) by the pool that does great steaks and ribs; there are two sittings for this restaurant each evening, so you can go earlier or later if you wanted. Then there is the Asian restaurant, which was amazing. This is another buffet restaurant, but the food was lovely! We visited here twice, and wish we could have gone on more occasions. There is also the Mexican restaurant down on the beach; we didn\u2019t visit this one so there is not a lot I can say about this one. The steakhouse and the Mexican restaurant are also used during the day for lunch. And if you feel a bit peckish at any point in the day, you can venture to the Sports bar and get a slice of pizza, hotdog or a sandwich. Entertainment: Well I don\u2019t know where to start with this, the entertainment team made my holiday! They are so friendly and want to make sure that everyone is happy! There is always something going on that is organised by them, during the day and in the evening. There were plenty of day time activities going on in and around the pool; anything from aqua aerobics to water polo and darts to salsa dancing, there is something for everyone, including bingo for those who don\u2019t want anything to strenuous! But the aqua aerobics is very much recommended by me, as it is a lot of fun, and not too hard! Then in the evening there was always something going on as well. There are shows that are put every night and they are very entertaining. The dancers on the animacion team are extremely talented and you will be amazed! The most entertaining show that we saw while we were there was the \u2018Crazy Show\u2019, I have never laughed so much at an entertainment show, it was so much fun. Some of the shows they also got the audience to take part, so if you want to avoid it, stay near the back! They were all so friendly, look out for Crazy James and Eder! I loved those two, so much fun! \uf04a Bars: if it was drinks you wanted, then it was drinks you got. The bar staff were so friendly and once they got to know your face they would recognise you and help you out straight away. There was a huge choice of cocktails that you could try, beer, wine and shots; so there was plenty there to keep you from getting bored. There are several bars around the hotel. During the day you have the pool bar which you can get to from the pool, or from inside the Lupita restaurant. Then near the hotel lobby there is the Terrace bar that is serving drinks throughout the day to late at night. The Sports Bar is open 24 hours a day, so you can go get a drink whenever you like. There\u2019s also the Lobby bar that you can go to at night when the shows are on. Staff at all of the bars are very friendly. Venturing out of the hotel: if you feel like you want to get out of the hotel day or night, there is plenty to do in the area near or a little bit further away. Just a 5 minute walk or a 2 minute mini cart ride from the hotel is the beach. This beach is fabulous, white sands, turquoise water, you couldn\u2019t ask for anything better, it is pure paradise. Once you are down the beach, you can just laze in the sun or do one of the activities that are available from the beach; from mini catamarans to jet skiing and you can even go on a little snorkelling boat trip to go see turtles. 10 minutes up the road is Playa Del Carmen with plenty going on. There is 5th Avenue, which has lots of shops for everyone, including the well known shops that you get back home and in the USA. There are plenty of places to eat if you feel like venturing out of the hotel for lunch or dinner one day. There are also lots of bars that you can go to for a great night out! One not to miss is Coco Bongo, it\u2019s not just a bar or a club, and it\u2019s a show with something for everyone! The show runs Monday to Saturday, and is well worth at least one visit for everyone! I went four times, and loved it every time I went. You pay to get in, and once you are in that is all your drinks included! The shows are amazing too, and you will not know what to expect until you have seen it, there are so many surprises for those visiting for the first time. There are also many other bars to visit in the town that makes up the great nightlife of Playa Del Carmen. Then if you want to travel a little bit further, for US$50 you can get a taxi up to Cancun for a night out there, with a great nightlife, including another Coco Bongo\u2019s! Well worth a trip, and if you can, do it with the Thomson organised Bar Crawl, over 400 English holiday makers \u2018crawling\u2019 four of the best bars in Cancun! Well worth the money we paid! So in conclusion, best holiday I have ever been on and cannot wait to return next summer, but for three weeks instead of two! Best place I have ever been to, and I fell in love the moment I got there with Mexico! Couldn\u2019t recommend it anymore if I tried! So if you have booked it or are thinking of booking it, do not hesitate!", "Date": "August 23, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manchester, UK", "Title": "\u201cGreat value, pay no attention to bad reviews!\u201d", "Author": "starrfluffythighs", "ReviewID": "UR38373192", "Content": "I've always been quite dubious about all inclusive holidays, however the Riu chain deliver quite well! The pool area is lovely, but the loungers seem to get 'booked up' quite early. Honestly though with a beach so beautiful only a short ride away its worth is to go to the beach! And it really only is a 5-10 minute walk there. Location of the hotel is alright, expect just over an hours transfer time from Cancun airport and it'll cost about 50 pesos to get to the 5th Avenue area....if you fancy a change from the hotel then I would definitely recommend a trip down there, the beach bars are great. Blue Parrot isn't that impressive but definitely check out Fusion, they have a reggae band playing and drinks offers every night, the atmosphere is fantastic. Hotel food - definitely try to get a restaurant every night, otherwise you'll get bored of the buffet food really fast, but you need to be there early, around 8 am to book them. For lunch I would avoid the beach restaurant as the choice isn't that great, best to eat by the pool restaurant Lupita, the choice is a bit better and you can get all types of drinks Drinks are always flowing! But if you want branded drinks like Smirnoff, Finlandia etc make sure you ask for them. The Sports Bar is more like a youth club, and the snacks they offer aren't the best! The rooms are kept immaculate, but to ensure this make sure you tip the housekeeping adequately. Hotel grounds are kept very very clean. In all this hotel and area is great for families and those who want a lazy beach holiday. Its fantastic value and you feel really welcome the staff do an amazing job. I wouldn't recommend this hotel for honeymooners as its just not that extra bit special and with the big groups of people it can get a bit rowdy.

I can't fault anything about The Tequila, the grounds, the rooms, the food and especially the people make this an unbelievable experience. The flight is a long one but on the whole it was ok. Watch out for the porters at Cancun aiport, they will rush to carry your cases, so have a few dollars to hand. We were welcomed with a cooling drink, given envelopes with towel cards and our room key and our cases followed shortly after. The rooms are comfortable, spacious and are cleaned daily to a very high standard. The mini bar is a bonus, which is topped up every two days. There are two pools divided by a restaurant which doubles as the Steakhouse in the evenings. The food is fab, something for everyone ,even for the most fussiest eaters. The main restaurant is where you have breakfast and the evening buffet meal. They have themed nights (Mexican, Carribean etc) during your holiday and I can highly recommend the Paella. The staff are so friendly and extremely hard working. Special mention to Mendez, but ALL the staff go out of their way to make your holiday wonderful. Yes, you do have to get up earlier to book for the speciality restaurants, but I was able to get a booking in the Asian restaurant after 9am. I didnt manage the Mexican though and this is located in the Yucatan. It wasn't difficult getting served at the bar, even whilst the entertainment was on, the staff don't leave you waiting for long , goodness knows how they remember everyone's order, but they do! There is lots going on all day long, and the entertainment staff are very friendly and will come around the pool asking if you would like to join in, but there is no pressure if all you want to do is chill. The sports bar has pc's if you want to use the internet ($8 for one hour which doesn't have to be used in one go) There is free wi-fi access in the reception area if you have your own lap top etc. I am not usually one for hotel evening entertainment but I thoroughly enjoyed the varied productions. Some were 'outside' entertainers but mostly provided by the animation team, who are like good friends by the end of your holiday. There is a small shop within the hotel selling the basics, but just turn left out the hotel and there is a shopping plaza with the usual souvenir shops, jewellers, farmacy and a starbucks. If you fancy a walk( it was very hot when we did it) it takes about 20mins to get into Playa del Carmen, where there's an abundance of shops, bars and restaurants. If you get chance go to Walmart, as you will get souvenirs, spirits etc much cheaper. (if paying by credit card remember to take your passport) The beach is fantastic, it can get very hot, so try and get a sunbed under the trees for a bit of shade. It's great that you can use the facilities of the Yucatan, we ate lunch there when we used the beach. You can also use the various water sports free(apart from anything motorised ) Be prepared to wait though for equipment. Probably the only negative I can come up with was that the excursions were very expensive. We went on three trips and although pricey, can highly recommend the Dolphin Discovery , we got $40 cashback pp with this so was able to use this on another trip,so we went on the Captain Hook trip, which I can highly recommend. Great night, plenty to drink (all included) and the food was fab, even had lobster for the first time.We also went to Xel-ha, a lovely place but unless you really love snorkelling, then a bit pricey. My daughter loves swimming but as soon as she was in the lagoon and spotted a massive sting ray and a huge Baracuda( with teeth showing!) she didn't want to go back in.Saying that it was a lovely place, too big to get round in one day and make sure you take extra money, deposit for the snorkels etc $20 pp, eco friendly sun lotion was about $15 on the coach, not sure how much in the park, and also you get asked an awful lot to have your photo taken with Parrots etc and at various places in the water, so have extra for these. There is also opportunity to swim with Dolphins here, and to 'walk' on the bottom of the sea and 'snuba' but again all extra, perhaps take a credit card with you! All in all, this was a fantastic holiday from start to finish, (apart from the mosquitos! ) and I would go back like a shot, and will certainly be returning in the future. A wonderful place with wonderful people, you will not be disappointed!

This is why I chose Riu because of the reviews and comments on Tripadvisor. We stayed on Aug.3-9 2009 Here's a breakdown of our experience: EXCELLENT STAFF! Everyone were sooo friendly and nice. Upon arrival, we were quickly greeted with smiles and four glasses of juice. Later that day, we wanted to switch rooms (our location was at the very back) and with no hesitation the front desk told us to re-pack and that our luggages will be sent to our new room. The staff at the buffet were so nice to our kids (ages 6 and 2)! Everytime they saw our kids they would always make them feel so special. Hola to Oscar and Fernando! POOL: IT'S OK Two pools were big! Weather was hot so I was expecting a nice cool dip in the pool but was greeted with warm water instead. Not complaining since I went to Mexico for the beach and not the pool. Pool groundswere not so nice. There were so many smokers around the pool area that cigarette butts were ALL OVER THE PLACE!! It is nasty!! Also, since there's a bar pool, I was turned off by the empty glasses around the pool area. Some resort guests just don't know how to appreciate the beautiful resort, other guests, and the staff that constantly tries to keep Riu clean. GROUNDS: The grounds were well maintained! Thanks to the staff at Riu, the resort looked really really nice and pristine. The lush jungle area is unbeliveable, made us wish we live in a tropical place. Besides the pool grounds, the rest of Riu were clean. BEACH: AWESOME!!! We never walked down the beach but the wait for the golf cart ride to get there is not 15 min. at all with what others had said. It's really less than that and who cares about the wait, just enjoy the surroundings! I have really nothing bad to say about it because me and my family just had so much fun just bumming around. Water was cool, the sand was vey soft and plenty of activities in the area. Plenty of chairs for everyone too! ROOM: Nice and clean! I love the fact there's always refreshments in our fridge. Room is big enough for four and the two beds are huge! I don't know why people complain about their bed being hard, we had no problem at all! ENTERTAINMENT: Good, since we never really stayed up very late to watch everything. I like the fact that they get the kids involved. We were there for the Michael Jackson tribute and it was really really good! I had a good close up shot of the impersonator, and they look very much alike! Did an awesome job with the MJ tribute! FOOD: We ate at the buffet the whole time we stayed there and it was good. Though same food were served everyday (very few changes), who cares? There were so many food to choose from, you won't get bored at all...not unless you're the picky type! Food at the Sports Bar is a little suspect. BAR: Nice choices of liquor. I especially liked the Bandita papaya (i think that's what it's called). Bartenders were really nice too. Overall my family and I love the stay at Riu. The staff really made our experience at Riu very comforting and enjoyable. I would definitely recommend this resort to everyone! To all future guests who likes to smoke and drink a lot, please dispose your cigarette butts and drinks properly! To all the staff at Riu!

If you do not expect the world then you should be pleasantly suprised. Upon arrival we were upgraded to a junior suite. A nice touch but not worth paying for the better room as rooms are fine. As people have mentioned the beach is a pleasant walk but worth it and the trolley will even stop and pick you up halfway if you wish. Pool is ok but can get like a warm bath at times, however the staff behind the pool bar are great. If you do want branded spirits make sure you ask by name for them as although on display they do use local if not requested. The drinks provided in the room are topped up whether you have used previous provision or not. We ended up with stuff no longer fitting in the fridge but new still left.. Food is the weakest part of hotel as although more than adequate it gets a little boring and it can be a pain booking into the restaurants and the guy is quite annoying when he tells you quite rudely not to be late but hey i'm sure he is just doing his job. Mosquitos really come out following a downpour whether u r wearing mozzie repellant or not but not as bad when sunny so just be careful after rain as they come out for a feed. Entertainment is hit and miss but the team work hard and are very polite. For the gym freaks you can use the yucatan which has the usual aerobic machines and both free weights and machine. Not bad for a holiday gym. Great for training around 4:30pm before heading back to pool for an hour at the swim up bar. Would I stay again? probably not but thats because I like to try different places, however I would certainly recommend it to anyone.

Better than what I prepare at home 95% of the time. We ate 3 evenings at the Bamboo Restauarant (you have to make a reservation) and thought it was excellent. It is also air-conditioned. The only air-conditioned areas are the sports bar, The Bamboo, and your room. You learn to live with it by going to the beach and getting in the pool. Don't worry about how your body looks, just do it and you will love it. We have travelled pretty exstensively and consider their pool area as excellent. The animation team is wonderful, the shows okay, and you are usually greeted by a musical group as you go into the dining room each night. The rooms all have a good view and the grounds are immaculate. Sometimes the maid did not make up our room when we wanted, but we got her trained by the end of our stay. We tip the maid daily.

The Riu is further from the beach than other hotels in the complex but it's a short walk or shuttle to the beachfront pool that the Riu Yucatan had and you can use all of their ammenities. My only complaint was that you had to make reservations for the fancy restaurants at 7:30 in the morning and by the time you waited in line (after you woke yourself up at the butt crack of dawn to get down there) everything was already full. I realize the restaurants fill up quickly but there has to be a better way to do that. I would definetly suggest the 50 peso trip to the Playa to check out all the stuff over there. You can get a ferry to Cozumel for 14 american dollars. Pay attention while you're there though. You can barter for alot of things, never take the first suggestion.

We got a great price on the holiday having booked it 3 weeks before departure. There had been many cancelations due to swine flu hence the good price. We arrived at Cancun airport and went outside to find the bus which was quite easy to find. We did have a man who claimed to be from Thomas Cook take our bags off us and take them to the bus for us but wouldn't leave till we gave him a tip. This is fair enough if we had wanted the service but he literally took the bags off us and as we had just arrived - we had no small notes so he ended up with a large tip! We were warned about this by the tour guide on the way back to the airport for the return leg so were careful not to let anyone take the bags then (and they did try). The resort itself is beautiful and large with a variety of animals some of which I had never seen before. We paid for a room upgrade as I had read some dissapointemtn with the rooms on trip advisor and we got a really huge room with living area and a proper wooden door to the bathroom. The air con was good and hotel cleaners excellent. The balcony felt very private and had a concrete wall separating it from the next balcone so you could not peer in. Having spoken to other guests, some had a huge problem with mozzies and insects in the room but I have to say, I only ever found one mosquito in the room all week. As the resort is so big and spacious, it can be quite tiring walking from your room to the recpetion only to find you have forgotton something and have to go back however this is not a critisism as it added to the feeling of privacy as everything was spaced out. May not be so suitable for those who have trouble walking some distance though. The staff were fantastic and seemed to really enjoy working there. They all had a smile and a 'Hola' for you as you walked past which was nice. IN fact the only grumpy member of staff I met was the chap who took the bookings for the evening meal who said in a rather curt tone everytime someone booked a time \"BE ON TIME\". I agree with other writers here that it is a pain booking the evening meals as you have to get up really early to get what you want and having been there all week, we couldn't ever get a table at the mexican restaurant which was a shame. However the evening buffet which you don't need to book is exceptional. There really is something for everyone and the quality is really really good. The management are also excellent too, very efficient. We booked a couple of trips through our Thomas Cook rep however when we hired a moped (15 US dollars for an hour or $30 for the day) and went to the local wallmart, we found a government travel agent selling the same tours at a much cheaper price. It wouldnt be so bad if it were a few dollars but some of the trips, Thomas Cook are taking $50 to $70 per PERSON over what wallmart are charging! I guess if you are looking for a bargain then it is best to book here otherwise, for ease of booking then go with the tour agent. I am always a bit nervous about the street vendors selling trips but the one in wallmart certainly looked reputable and if I went back I woudl book through them. The weather was great and while it rained a few times, it cleared up really quickly (and the thunder and lighting is spectacular to watch anyway!). We don't have children but looked to have really good child facilities including nightly entertainment and a kids pool. Mozzies seemed quite bad but as I had been bitten lots in Cuba last year, I made sure I was covered head to toe everytime I stepped outside the room in 50% deet repellant. It must have worked as I have come home with only one bite on my shoulder. Yes, it stinks but it seems to do the job. What may also have helped was the gin and tonic I was drinking...apparently, it is a mozzie repellant and makes your skin taste bad...thats the excuse I'll use next holiday anyway! The only downside - and this is not the fault of the hotel, was that we found there were quite a few drunken groups who had perhaps never been on an all inclusive holiday before and took the free drink to extremes ending up absolutely slaughtered by about 9pm. It was discovered that some of these people normally went to Spain but as the Euro is so bad and the swine flu making mexico luxury holidays so cheap - they ended up there. Fair enough, but to get so drunk and become a nuisance of yourself isn't nice for the other guests who can pace themselves properly with drinkto last the night in a really hot country. One warning if you are buying jewellery (5th avenue) - we bought a necklace and the guy negotiated in pound sterling which was good for us. We got a necklace down from \u00a3200 to \u00a380 however when the shopkeeper rang it through it came through at 2,800 pesos and we didn't realise till we got home that this was actually about \u00a3140!!! So, this was our fault for being trusting brits assuming that shopkeepers will be honest!

Flew with Thomson from Manchester, and upgraded to premium, which I can say, is really not worth it. Have done it before, a few years back and that was great, but this time the TVs were not working properly throughout the journey, food wasn\u2019t nice, and suitcases took about 45 minutes to collect. Definitely gone downhill! So we arrived at the hotel, welcomed by the staff, and got given our envelope with room key and towel cards in. Our suitcases got taken off us, and we got shown to our rooms. The rooms are spacious, very clean, lovely bathroom and the bed is comfy as well. The pools are gorgeous and very big. The left side of the pool, with the swim up bar, is more relaxing and quieter, whereas the right side is where the main activities take place (aerobics, water basketball etc.), it\u2019s more fun and good English music is played. The pools are kept very clean, and even the shower poles get cleaned regularly. The food is gorgeous, and even me being a very fussy eater, could find something to eat every time, without it being the same every day. You have to make reservations for the Asian, Mexican and the steak house, but I would definitely recommend the Asian, it is gorgeous. The steak house was nice, and only my parents tried the Mexican but said it wasn\u2019t very nice. Definitely the nicest food I\u2019ve had at an all inclusive. The beach across the road is gorgeous, I only went there a few times as I prefer the pool, but it was always very easy to find sunbeds there and nice and cool. It is only a 2 minute walk from the hotel, down a shaded area, or you can catch the shuttle bus, although this stops between 1 and 3. The entertainment crew at the hotel are the best! If they weren\u2019t there, the holiday wouldn\u2019t have been half as good as it was! They work so hard, all day around the pool doing activities with everyone, which are always really fun, then practice for the show that evening, and then they do the show most nights which are really good. Sometimes they have people from outside the hotel to do a show, which I personally didn\u2019t enjoy as much, but was still able to sit through them to watch. Even after the entertainment crew have done a show at night, some of them take people out from the hotel into Playa Del Carmen, which I did a fair few times and loved it! We went to a club called Coco Bongo, which is a must do! There are no words to describe how good it is there. If I remember correctly, it was $35 for girls on a Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, then $50 on a Thursday, Friday and Saturday, and always $50 for men. But this is all drinks included, and a separate area in the club, with seats. It is well worth it. We also went to a club called Dubai which is also very good and that was $10 or $35, depending on the night, to get in with all drinks included. It is very easy and safe to get a taxi back to the hotel at the end of the night, there are loads waiting outside the clubs. We did a few excursions out of the hotel, which we booked with our Thomson reps, which were excellent. We went swimming with dolphins, with Dolphin Discovery, at Isla Mujeres, which was amazing! I can\u2019t remember the exact price but it was around $200. We got picked up from the hotel at 7.00am, and had a 1 hour trip to Cancun, we then boarded a catamaran for an approx 20 minute ride to Isla Mujeres. We got offered drinks and bread on the way for free. We did the Royal Swim which includes, handshake with the dolphins, a kiss, dorsal tow (pulled along by the dolphins) and foot push, which is where the dolphins lift you up into the air by their noses on the bottom of your feet, it is amazing. We then enjoyed snorkelling with sting rays, then with sharks, although with the sharks you are behind a glass wall. After that we got a free taxi to garrafon, where we had lunch, and snorkelled in the Great Maya Reef. There is also a zip line there which is 100 feet above the sea, very easy to use and great fun. This whole day was well worth the money, everything was included in the $200 (approx) that we paid. I also went on the Thomson Cancun bar crawl. This is so much fun and very cheap considering what you get. It was around $80, and this is transport to and from Cancun, all drinks included, and entry to all the bars/clubs. First bar you go to is called Ultra Bar & Terrace, which is a nice start to the night. The next stop is Daddy Rocks which is really fun, they have a band playing, and they had a man impersonator of Britney. After that is Carlos & Charlie\u2019s, where you get given a half yard class full of a cocktail as you walk in. There are men covered in glitter in there which you tip them for a photo. The last stop is the amazing Coco Bongo, this is bigger than the one in Playa Del Carmen, but near enough the same experience. The coach journey on the way back feels like a lifetime when you just want to be back in your bed, but it is worth it. I had the best time of my life on this holiday and I am definitely returning. Looking to go back next year for 3 weeks, can\u2019t wait! The only downside to this holiday was one of our cases didn\u2019t arrive back to Manchester from Mexico, and still hasn\u2019t over 3 weeks later, and they\u2019ve now stopped looking. The suitcase had all of our photos and DVD from the dolphins, all other photos from other trips, souvenirs, and of course everything else. Luckily it was my mums and not mine. We are not bothered about the clothes or anything, as they can be replaced, but the photos cannot. So be careful when checking in at Cancun airport. We were checked in with another flight, going to Gatwick, at the same desks, which is unusual. Thomson haven\u2019t seemed bothered about the case going missing, and haven\u2019t helped at all.

My son's friend, who was traveling with us, tripped while walking through an area of crowded tables. He had not been drinking. He just tripped. He tried to keep from falling by holding onto a table which tipped with him.. The table broke. A manager grabbed his arm and took him to the front desk area. Apparently, a discussion ensued about what was to be done. Although we were in our room, we were never called. The boy is 16 years old. He was badly frightened by the incident. The next day, late afternoon, a very large man came to our room and handed us a piece of paper. The man was scowling. This is not an exaggeration. I felt like I was being given a summons. The paper said to see Joseph in Public Relations. I went to see Joseph and was told that we would be charged for the table. In the U.S., the guest and the guest's safety would be the first concern. We were treated as if this boy had intentionally broken the table. I stated that it was an accident,and that he had tripped. Joseph agreed and said we were still responsible for the table. The charge is not the issue. It's $25.00. It's the fact that they physically accosted this young man and did not notify his parents. It's also the fact that he innocently tripped among crowded tables and both he and we were made to feel like we had committed some sort of misdemeanor. To recapture $25.00, the hotel has lost any good will they would have had and all of our future business. As this is our second stay at a RIU, I can only assume that future revenue is in the thousands. A seemingly minor incident at the beginning of our vacation should have been a harbinger of things to come. When we received our room key, we didn't check it to see if the ring that holds the key (they are the old-fashioned keys on a ring - not the computerized key cards) was in good condition - nor would anyone else have. We were busy checking in and getting to our room. A day or two later, we realized the key was gone from the ring. The ring, which was very flimsy, had easily pulled apart. I went to the front desk, told them we had lost the key and showed them the key ring - a very fine circle of wire that was easily pulled apart. They told me they would have to charge me $20 for another key. I said, \" but the ring on your key holder is not strong.\" Their reply, \"how do we know you didn't break it,\" That is nearly verbatim. I almost wanted to say, \"You know, you see right through me. I spent an hour trying to destroy this key chain and, viola!, I managed to lose the key just as I had planned.\" They then decided to \"do me a favor\" and only charged me $10.00 for a new key. There are so many great staff at this resort. The waiters, the housekeepers, the groundskeepers. All were wonderful. I wish I could say the same for the management. I have been in the hotel industry for more than 30 years in all capacities and I would never treat a guest the way that they treated my son's friend or myself. By the way, I'm not a mother who always thinks her child is right. Had my son or his friend been in the wrong, I would have hauled them up to the front desk myself and demanded that they apologize and make restitution. Howev er, in this case, even the management stated that it was an accident and yet still made me and my family feel like we had done something very wrong. If you plan to stay here, and more importantly, if you plan to bring your children here, stay very close to them and by all means, don't slip, don't fall or have any other type of accident in close proximity to anything breakable or you will be buying it.

We had one day of rain, but for the rest of the holiday the weather was great. It is also very humid at night, take lots of very lightweight clothes. Anyway back to the hotel, the staff were so friendly and can't do enough for you, the place is gorgeous, grounds are fabulous too. The entertainment in the evenings is good compared to most hotel shows. The animation team are very good, and work very hard. Most days we spent down on the gorgeous beach, it is really beautiful, and you get more breeze down there. The pool is nice, but it was just too hot for me around the pool. The Yucatan hotel runs right down to the beach, so you can aways get a drink from the beach bar, and also the beach restaurant does lunch, pizza, hotdogs, burgers,salads, anything you could want. All the food was excellent from breakfast to the evening meal. I put on half a stone in 10 days! Even though I loved the Tequila, i preffered the location of the Yucatan, because it is right next to the beach, but it really is only a few minutes from the Tequila, and the night life at the Tequila is better. We went into Playa del carmen which was great and really lively but we were too lazy and hot to go again. I would recommend the F1 trip which was good fun, even though it rained the day we went, we still enjoyed it, not for wimps though, the boat is very fast and bumpy, but the crew were great and we swam with turtles. We also did the pirate trip which was great too. I didn't want to come home and would go back tomorrow.

The air con in the room was easy to use and more to the point was cold!!. The beds were made every day and rooms were cleaned daily with change of towels daily. The mini bar and optics were re-stocked every 2 days but if you ran out of something the staff were only too pleased to bring you more.

We ate at the stakehouse one night, the food was good but the food was served to you on the plate and you could not help youself to anything. You are booking for the table service rather than anything else. The various bars were all comfortable and well run. The sports bar attracted the younger ones - namely Americans on their spring break, which proved to be too much for all the Brits by the end of their holidays. My advice would be check when spring breaks are.. the kids were left to run wild and drink as much as they possible could .. maybe the legal age limit in America is 21 for a reason!!! The adults weren't much better and the majority were just rude. Americans think it is beneath them to queue. We had several altercations where they just barged their way through everyone else in the dinner queue and worst of all when using the beach buggy!!. Having said that the hotel itself was brilliant and weather hot, I would definitely go again but would be more careful as to when We have heard that this hotel is to become more geared towards European and the other \"sister hotels\" for Americans.

I wanted a place that could please us all without breaking the bank. The room was standard sized and had two full sized beds pushed together under the same headboard. We got a cot for my sister and it was surprisingly comfortable. My only complaint was that the air never quite felt cold. The room was cooler than outside but not the 63 degrees that I set it at. I asked others staying in the same building and all felt the same way. There is a minifridge with beer, soda, and water under the bathroom sink but we rarely used it cause would only spend time in the room to sleep. There is also a shot dispenser on the wall. The safe is thin and slim but easily fit my laptop (10\"x13\"), wallet, and my wifes purse. There is free wifi in the lobby, but I didn't find out until my last day. Oh well, I guess its for the best cause I got to enjoy real life instead of cyberspace. The beach is easily accessible through the covered walkway. Golf carts pic you up if you don't feel like walking. There are tons of beach loungers on the beach that are never full. If you're hungry or need a drink you can easily get something from the adjacent hotel RIu Yucatan. The only thing you wont find at the Yucatan is a place to sit. There are towels on every single pool lounger placed early in the morning and the owners may or may not show up. That problem wasn't at the Tequila pools but there weren't as many people staying there. You will see topless women and thongs here so if you aren't used to it don't stay in Yucatan peninsula because it's common in all pools and beaches. It wasn't a problem to us cause we're open minded to others' customs. My son or sister didn't care at all. So prudes stay away. The breakfasts and lunches were fine as they are buffet style. I got up early enough each day to make reservations and we tried all of the alacart dinners. The \"Lupita\" steakhouse was nice because we were served from start to finish. They serve way too much and I felt bad cause we're not big eaters so we wasted a lot of food. The \"Bamboo\" Asian restaurant was buffet style and was decent. My sister loved the fried ice cream so much she made us go another night because she had never had that before. The Mexican restaurant was nice because you use the Yucatan \"Beach club\" that faces the beach. I loved the ocean sounds at dinner. There is also an on site disco called \"La Pinata.\" My sister went to every night and really enjoyed it. The dj's play the same mix each night but its fun to see people get drunk and start dancing. The disco is small but is nice if you don't want to party all night. It is open from 11pm to 2am. The entertainment staff is top notch. they work extremely hard to please you. They were never pushy to get me to do activities if I didn't want to even though in previous days I did all the activities. They sit down with you randomly at lunch and they are full of interesting stories and information. They work from 10am to 11pm six days a week so please if you don't want to do any activities at least give them a smile with your \"no thank you.\" I visited the Riu Yucatan and Riu Playacar and I can easily say that the Riu Tequila is the best of the three. The Tequila has the liveliest atmosphere and looks newer and cleaner. I can't comment on the two Riu Palace properties because you don't get access to them unless you stay there. Don't be hesitant to stay at the Tequila because it isn't beachfront. Some of the mega properties that claim to be beachfront such as the Grand Mayan Riviera Maya can take you up to half an hour to get to the pool or beach because it is so big. For the price and the level of enjoyment I received I'm planning on going back next year for my cousin's wedding who is booking the Grand Mayan for the family...except for me...he he he!", "Date": "July 4, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Welshys", "Title": "\u201cAbsolutley Fab!\u201d", "Author": "Welshys", "ReviewID": "UR33878229", "Content": "After reading through almost every review on here, I was an expert on both the good and bad things to expect from the Tequila. Yet, after 24 hours of being there I can honestly say I don't understand the problems people found. Check in was quick and easy, with the bags arriving about 20mins after at the room. The whole area seemed permanantly spotless, and many days i put the do not disturb sign out to stop the keen cleaners. Even if we told them to leave our room for the day we'd have a phone call to ask when it would next be conveniant for them to come. The walk to the beach was very easy, we caught the shuttle if it was there, but if not would be happy to walk. The staff were exceptional, very hard-working and very informative and helpful. We went on a night out with the entertainment staff and had an amazing night where we were looked after very well! the hotel workers never seemed to stop with their service and entertainment. the only bad point was that once you were friendly with the staff they would try and get you involved in the shows every night! Good fun! The variety and quantity of food was exceptional! My partner is very picky on food but even he came back a bit heavier! The playacar Plaza sold all the typical holiday junk and had a general shop selling all sorts. this was around a 4minute walk and easily accessible. If you couldnt find what you wanted there, its only a 5 minute taxi to fifth avenue and the beach there. Very conveniant! the only fault i found with the whole holiday was being eaten alive! my partner didnt seem to have that problem but i must be edible! we bought the sprays and plug-ins before hand but nothing was as good as \"OFF\", sold locally to the Tequila. Of course though we paid for such a good holiday with a 24 hour delay with thompson where we spent the night at the Riu Caribe in Cancun, and only then did we realise the value of the Riu Tequila, as its standards were so much higher!

This time we had a trip to Tulum which was really good, and we also booked the Columbus Dinner Cruise through Thomsons, but we were very disappointed with this, the best part about it was sailing around Cancun lagoon...the food was shocking! - it was supposed to be a romantic evening with a steak and lobster dinner, but we couldnt even cut through our steak, and it all looked very unappetising, so I would definitely stay away from that trip....we wished we had gone on the pirate evening instead. We upgraded to premium class and on the flight out the service was excellent. Each time the stewardesses came round with a drink, they gave everyone 2 drinks, the food was nice too.

There were always plenty of fresh fruit and salads etc, so you're covered even if you just feel like something light. The steakhouse was very nice, Asian restaurant was nothing special and we never got round to using the Mexican one so can't comment. Service at the bars was good with or without a tip, and there is a long and varied cocktail list to choose from. We didn't really watch the shows in the evening because it's not really our thing, but I gather they usually went down pretty well with the audience. During the day there are activities on all the time and the staff regularly come round the pool to invite people to participate, but if you don't feel like it they don't try to pressure you into it, they're happy just to chat to you for a few minutes then move on. As other reviews have said there's not much happening nearby outside of the hotel in the evenings, so if you want a change of scenery a 25min walk or 5min taxi ride to Playa del Carmen is the best bet.

Things about this hotel we didn't like - All you can drink CHEAP Booze!!! we wouldn't drink their best liquors at home why would we do it on vacation. drinks were too sweet or too sour just CHEAP. The hotel has NO room service even when they say they do. The food was average nothing special even at the restaurants with reservation needed. Which by the way have to be made at 7am (try doing that with a hang over from all the cheap booze). Bugs were our constant companion especially in the rooms. Where we averaged 10-15 mosquito murders a night. There was no wait service anywhere at the resort. We got up and walked to the bar for every drink including by the pool. The pool bar shuts down by 6pm and they don't allow you to walk to the closest bar because they also close it. There are more things that we disliked but if you are a real traveler this should be enough. In the end I would not recommend this hotel to a friend or stranger. In fact I would not recommend Playa Del Carmen which has turned from a beautiful beach town to a commercialized, over sold and annoying place to spend your vacation.

Clean, great amenities however our last day tainted our opinion of the Riu chain. We paid $50 US for a late check out so that we could swim all day and get ready for our return flight home in our own room. Well worth the $50. However after being at the pool for only an hour my 14 year old son headed back to the room to charge his ipod for our trip home. When he arrived at the room the door was closed over with the safety latch and he was unable to get in. He came back and got my husband. Returning to the room they found the back sliding door open, the safety latch across the main door and our safe wide open. Our money, our ipod's and our jewlery (purchased down there) were all stolen. Perhaps an employee knew we would not be in our room (late check out, at the pool) and they knew someone that could open the safe and had a key? The managers insisted that one of our family members must have taken our things and it was just a simple mix up. It just seemed a little too coincidental that it was our last day which meant we couldn't create too much trouble for the hotel since we only had hours left. The hotel would not give us a copy of the report either. Why? We met another couple down there that had the same thing happen to them the week previous. Excellent vacation if you don't count the $700 worth of stolen items we now have to replace.

And we have been to a few good ones in our time. From the moment we stepped off the transfer coach, we had our cases taken out of our hands and replaced with a welcome cocktail. The rooms are spacious and there was air conditioning and a fan so you could choose which you used. We found the fan quieter and cooler. There is an inclusive mini bar in the room which is restocked every 2 days. This included 4 optics, plus beers, soft drinks and water. The animation team were some of the best we have seen. They were always friendly and keen to get you involved with the activities, but without pestering you. They always had time for you. The food quality and choice in the restaurant was outstanding. Something for everything and constantly refreshing the food if not cooking it right in front of you. The shows were, well ok. I've seen better but I've also seen a lot worse. The Michael Jackson night is worth a watch. I also like the fact that the entertainment team were there to greet you every evening on the way into the restaurant wearing their costumes for that evening. They were always happy to pose for photos with the kids. The internet cafe was good too as you can buy time by the hour, but use it up as you wish. You are given a code and you can go on for as long as you want and the minutes count down. When you log off, they stop and you could log on again the next day and use the rest of the minutes. The hotel is a pleasant 10 minute stroll from the beach, down a private path next to another RIU hotel. There is a shuttle buggy which runs up and down the path but we just walked most of the time, although the shuttle buggy runs constantly, except between 1pm and 3pm. You can get drinks and food from the Yucatan when down at the beach but this was much busier so most beach days, we just went back to the Tequila.

Rooms: My only complaint about the room is that sheets were not changed daily and in such a warm climate I think they should be or at least every other day. They were changed once in the week while we were there, so about every three days if you allow the maid service each day. Had we asked, I'm sure they could have been changed more often. Our A/C worked, but was not as cold as some of our friends\u2019 rooms. Other than that, the room was kept very clean and the mini bar well stocked! The hotel grounds were immaculate and beautiful as well! Beach: Most beautiful ocean water I\u2019ve ever seen at a resort, even with the sand bags! The walk to the beach is not bad at all, literally took us five minutes and we walked there every time, never took the trolley. Tons of loungers \u2013 never had a problem getting a group of them together at any time of the day. Even though you\u2019ll be offered a drink here and there by hotel staff walking the beach with trays full of different beverages, I suggest brining a mug with you. A few vendors walk the beach so bring some money if you want your hair braided, you want to go parasailing, etc. Pool: Very clean and spacious! Loved the swim up bar and the service there! During the day there were a lot of activities happening in or around the pool. Again, never had a problem getting a group of loungers together at any time of the day. I do have to note that I had the WORST bathroom experience of my life at the Yucatan poolside restrooms. Each stall had overflowing waste baskets and most toilets were clogged AND overflowing with paper and poop because not a lot of people realize Mexico doesn't have a sewer system like ours, your not suppose to flush paper products. It doesn't say this in every bathroom, but if you're a knowledgeable traveler you just know not to. Restaurants: The dinner buffet was good and had different options every night. The Steakhouse was really good, but it didn\u2019t have the steakhouse quality I\u2019d expect back home in the States. At first I thought the portions were skimpy, but in the end I left very full both nights we ate there! The Asian buffet restaurant was great, ranged from typical Chinese food to sushi, try the fried ice cream for dessert. This was one of my favorite meals, but most in my group weren\u2019t as pleased. The Mexican restaurant was my least favorite, although the shrimp entr\u00e9e was amazing, the premeal buffet just didn't satisfy at all. I do not recommend lunch at the Yucatan beach side buffet, not a lot of options and the food always tasted old or looked recycled. The lunch buffet at the Tequila was good but repetitive and served its purpose! I added A1 sauce to my burgers and potatoes to give it more flavor as the week went on! Service: All in all, the service was great whether it was bartenders or the front desk staff helping you. It did not take long to get served at any of the bars and they were great regardless whether you tipped or not, but they seemed to recognize you and remember your drink each trip if you tipped every once in awhile and why wouldn\u2019t you?! The Sports Bar gets busy after the entertainment ends and the disco closes. They offer sandwiches, burgers, pizza and nachos, but they disappear quickly. We often grabbed some and brought it back to our room fridge until we were ready to eat to help guarantee we\u2019d have a midnight snack \u2013 all that drinking gets you hungry! Exchange rates at the hotel were decent, not as good as the bank, but still better than most places in town. Disco: Not too bad, decent sized, vacationers from the Yucatan come over because they don't have one, so there are usually lots of people. The DJs played some of the same music and didn\u2019t always honor requests, but it was still fun and is only open a few hrs each night. Location: Very conveniently located, it is next to a mini mall, a 5 minute walk or less away, but more expensive than in town. The town of Playa del Carmen is only a 5 minute taxi ride for $5 or a 20-25 minute walk, very peaceful and it\u2019s nice to see all the hotels and condos. We walked there and back the first day, just bring sunscreen and something to drink! Things get cheaper in town the further you go, so if you\u2019re patient you will save a few bucks and try bartering at places where there is no fixed price. We visited town at all times during the day and night and never felt unsafe, whether it was just 2 of us or the whole group of 20. Excursions: We did the bar hop tour, Coco Bongo is a must see if you like bars and clubs, it will blow your mind! You also visit Carlos and Charlies and Senior Frogs. Went scuba diving off Cozumel. The water was crystal clear and even more beautiful than in PDC, but the ferry ride was a little bumpy - first time I expereinced motion sickness of any kind and I love boat and plane rides. Also did the ATV, zipline and cenote tour. Swimming in the cenote was the best part, it was so cool and refreshing after 10 miles of ATVs and 3 ziplines in the hot sun! All in all, we had a fabulous stay and the Riu brand resurrected themselves from one of the worst all-inclusive resorts to one of the best, in our opinion. Must have had a rare experience last year in PV because had I not seen the Riu name all over the place this year, I would have thought it to be a completely different resort. I would definitely return, but we try to stay some place new each year, but no matter where we go, we now have a really good chance at staying at a Riu again! I would recommend this resort for families or groups of young adults. If you're looking for a romantic getaway, try the Palace. My biggest complaint all week was the behavior of other guests.

The rooms are nice and clean the bar in the room was good always topped up plenty of water and beer fresh towels when you need them only thing to watch is the mosys I used to spray room at night no problems then.Pool is great nice and clean got a bit noisey late in afternoon with our spanish frends but amusing most of the time. the beach is great plenty of sun chairs not alot of shade though you will have heard about the whales in the water but you get used to that great fun on a windy day with waves coming over top of them.The sports facilitys are good hoby cats are brilliant.I do recomend the snorkel trip and take a camera excellent value. overall this holiday was outstanding value the people are brilliant we wil definatly be returning hopefully next year", "Date": "May 6, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver", "Title": "\u201cGreat value!

Since the resort isn't right on the beach, you don't get a lot of people from the other resorts coming to the Tequila until late in the evening, when they come for the disco (we were usually so wiped out from laying in the sun that we went to bed early!). We noticed that the Yucatan's pool area and buffets were substantially busier than the Tequila's. The beach is a short, leisurely walk or a shuttle ride away - people were usually good about letting the people who were waiting first for the shuttle go ahead (though we saw the Spainish girls budge the line twice). The food was good - I am a really picky eater and I was able to find something I enjoyed at every meal. We booked the Asian restaurant and the Steakhouse - the steak was surprisingly good and we really enjoyed our experience there. The Asian restaurant is buffet, and it was just okay...we heard that the Mexican restaurant is really good, but didn't get a chance to book it. Oh, at the buffet dinner, try the coconut ice cream for dessert - it is amazing! Our room was on the second floor, and I can see why people had recommended getting a room that wasn't ground level - there are a lot of little bugs and mosquitos in Playacar! You have to remember - it is the tropics and the tropics have bugs! Bring bug spray, because we did get a few mosquito bites from sitting outside to watch the shows in the evening. We only found 2 mosquitos in our room and the odd ant. There was some interesting wildlife around the resort, but nothing scary! Iquanas, giant rodent looking things (they were cool looking!), under-fed cats (which are a good sign, because they will eat any mice that are around - we never saw any)! Our room was cleaned everyday by Patricia, who is about 4 feet tall, but the sweetest thing! She would organize our tolietries and even my books that were beside the bed. Our last full day there was her day off and we could tell because the same amount of care just wasn't there...but our room was still clean (just not as organized)! We had no issues with theft or things not working in the room - we heard some people complaining to the front desk that their air conditioning had stopped working, but they sent a worker there right away and it was fixed within the hour. The front desk staff are very helpful if you need to ask them anything (like how to work the phone!) :) We didn't book any excursions - we spent all our time laying on the beach! We went into Playa for a few hours to walk around and buy some authentic Mexican tequila! We went to Senor Frogs for a margarita, then came back to the resort. Definitely go into Playa - it's a $5 taxi ride each way and totally worth it for the experience! If you like Kalhua, you can buy a 1 litre bottle for $10 USD! Our last full day, we booked a jet ski, which was $60 USD for 1/2 hour (ish). If you are out there too long, they will let you know (they've got guys on jet skis out in the water monitoring). We talked to Ian at Scuba Caribe, which are the guys that walk around on the beach in front of Riu Yucatan and try to sell you on watersports. Ian was so friendly that we actually did decide to book :) Things to pack when going to Mexico! - a hat (best thing I ever brought) - lots of sunscreen, because it can get expensive when you run out! - aloe vera for when you burn (because you probably will, even with sunscreen)! - US cash (get some pesos if you plan on doing some major shopping in Playa, otherwise, don't worry about it) - a disposable underwater camera so you can take pictures if you do watersports or just swim in the ocean - a backpack to carry your stuff to the beach - Bubba kegs or large coffee mugs to fill up at the bar before heading to the beach to save yourself a few trips! We are already planning our next trip to Mexico and it's a shame that the whole \"swine flu\" thing has put a damper on travel to Mexico, because we had such an amazing time!

Riu Tequila now closed for at least 3 weeks and all remaining guests there were transferred over to the Yucatan - glad we left before that, just arrived home today. However, we loved the hotel - the staff were amazing, always smiling and helpful. They treated to you just the same whether you tipped or not - which made you appreciate them even more. The entertainment team were excellent - although they should have been exhausted - they just never seemed to stop and they were all so so friendly, especially Lario and Carolina. The main restaurant was very good and we could always find something we liked but yest it got a bit samey after a week or so but on the whole the food was good. We tried all the restaurants and enjoyed them all although we found having mashed potato dished up with steak at the steak house not to our liking. When we mentioned this at the end of our meal they asked us to come back the following evening (without having to book) and said they would cook us a special meal. Which they did beautifully - we had steak chips and mushrooms and salad and enjoyed every mouthful - they treated us very well indeed. The Asian restaurant was nice too especially if you liked Sushi. We also liked the Mexican but if you eat there wear bite spray as the mossies are pure evil down there. Once the Tequila re-opens I would definately recommend it and I am sure in the coming months you will get some really cheap deals out there - enjoy.

For the people going there waiting for a good time and a lot of fun, you are going to the right place! The hotel is really nice, the rooms are great, nothing special but big enough and confortable, even tough it is not on the beach, this is a great spot.

Do not forget that this hotel is way cheaper that most of the hotels in this area and you will definitly not be desapointed, unless you are the type of person who don't want to pay and want everything in exchange, like most of the people who are writing in this website. My week was amazing, the hotel is great, staff is really nice, beach is great but if you like the perfect beaches, do not expect that, there is some sands bags, this his still beautiful, but if you want a really nice beach and be in Playa, you need to go to the north part of Playa, so Royal Playa del Carmen, Shangrila or Grand coco Bay ar much better.

The pool and most common areas were overtaken by the loud, chain-smoking, drunken and rowdy students. They defaced signs with black markers, banged on doors, threw drink garnishes in the pool and were generally no fun to be around if you were not part of their group.

A great mix of winding tropical hotel/pool grounds and beach (albeit the walk or ride to it) with lots of coconut trees. On the beach you could choose to be in the sun or shade just by moving your chair around a little bit. Lots of trees on the beach which many other resorts lack. The resort, location, facilities, service, staff, everything was great. It did not have the stuffiness of a 5-star resort (good or bad) so I would say it was more of a 4 star. Guests from many different countries, which was fun. If I had to complain about anything it would be the beach towel policy is too restrictive (swap a card for a towel, only 1 per day, get your card back when you return the towel) however, I do realize there needs to be a way to control it. The only other fault I could find was wondering how they could control the birds coming into the buffet area. I am an animal lover and pet owner, but when my husband saw a bird actually standing in and eating out of a chopped fruit salad bowl on the buffet (beachfront restaurant) - that was a bit too much. We had just given our 3 year old a plate with that fruit salad on it. How can you control it without losing the atmosphere? I don't know. Usually the staff was very good and kept everything picked up so the birds didn't have a chance. But the birds are opportunists. I wouldn't want to lose that open atmosphere. That being said - we loved the place - the kids loved the pool and that they could get \"kiddie cocktails\" at the swim-up bar and just kick around the entire pool area. I loved laying in a chair on the beach under the swaying coconut trees. The clothes drying racks on the balconies were a great idea, as was the A/C which automatically shut off when the sliding door on the balcony was open.

Lowered my expectations after reading the reviews but no need for that this place is excellent. The only negative was having to make reservations so early in the morning for all the a la carte resturants. Visted all three with no problems and enjoyed everyone one of them. Mexi one was my favorite. At the beach club at dinner by the beach, food was really good. The staff were always cleaning something tipped our maid everyday and had the cute towel animals couldn't wait to see what was waiting for us. Never stayed up for the disco didn't open till 11:00pm and was over tired from all the walking. The kids from Spain were there and yes they were really loud sang outside in the early hours of the morning. Not the resorts fault not sure what they could have done to stop it. The fact that they were rude as well as some of the other guests is not the resorts problem it is the people staying there , it is sad how those who work there cater to your every need and seldom did I see anyone tip for excellent service but wanted to complain about the little things. Did not like booking the trip to Coba with the Obitz rep wasn't the tour we wanted and the price went up the next day. But ended up having the best time will never forget that day. There is food 24/7 even though we didn't eat from the snack cooler no need to since we ate breakfast,dinner and lunch everyday. I thought the food was better than average for a buffet. plenty to choose from, clean and very tasty not bland at all. Resort is beautiful, the workers are always cleaning and doing what they can to please the guests. Sportsbar would find what you were looking for even got to watch the CAVS playoff game with no problems. Only watched one show and that was the Mayian show. It was pretty good. Chairs near the pool were hard to find and I don't agree with people saving chairs as it is not fair to the people that are at the pool to use it (not just holding a chair so when they decide to come down they can) this goes with how rude people can be, this place goes out of its way to make it a vacation for everyone too bad the guests have to ruin it. Once again can't fault the resort for this. On our last day I was tempted to go around and fold up everyones towel and move them but didn't. I could go on and on about how woderful this place was but I wont. If thinking about staying there go see for yourself. However, I can be a pain in the butt sometimes and I had no complaints can't wait to go back. Just shows some people are never satisfied or their expectations are way to high.

My wife and I, along with another couple and their 12 year old daughter stayed at the Tequila for 6 days and we just got back. It was all of our first times at the resort. Here are our thoughts (including commentary on the previously mentioned Spaniards...) TRAVEL: We flew direct into Cancun from Charlotte, NC, got in early around 11 am and breezed through customs- almost no waiting time at all even though we came in on the Saturday before Easter. We booked a private transfer through USA Transfers- I read about them on this site. You should definitely check them out. We booked our trip through bookit.com and they try to build the round-trip transfers into the cost of your trip. Last year we used the bookit provided transfer and found out the hard way that they pick up several groups at a time and stop at the different resorts on their way to yours- if you're lucky you are the first or second resort, if not- you wait... USA Transfers was half the price, provides a private van for your party only, and they are quick to respond to emails as well. They were easy to find right outside the doors of the airport and had a sign with our names on it- we were in the van and on our way within 5 minutes. We saved about 200 dollars as a group using them. Very professional, prompt, no problems at all. ARRIVAL: We got to the Tequila around 12:15. At check in we asked to have rooms next to or near each other (we did request this with our original booking) and we asked for 2nd floor rooms. No problem! One of our rooms was already set, and the other one was being cleaned. We got our keys, and put all of our stuff in the one room. Upstairs rooms, right next to each other in building 20. We grabbed a bite to eat in the lunch buffet and were in the pool sipping on boat drinks by 1:30. ROOMS: The 2nd floor rooms are definitely the way to go. Bugs were not a big problem, but if you're on the ground floor you are definitely more likely to attract critters if you leave things on the porch. We saw a snake, some bugs, and some \"catlemurcoons\" around the resort. Rooms were good enough, two double beds pushed together, a good sized bathroom, separate toilet, good shower, etc. There is a liquor dispensor in your bathroom with Tequila (Cuervo gold), and some generic rum, vodka, and gin. They stock your fridge with beer (Dos Equis) soda, and water. Rooms were generally not cleaned until a bit late in the day, maybe 2 or 3:00 but it really didn't matter to us too much. We left between 3 and 5 bucks per day for our maid, asked for more beer and water, and had no problem with getting what we asked for. There is a safe in your room big enough to put your laptop in. We had no issues whatsover with the security of items in our room. The TV had plenty of English stations, but we didn't watch too much of it. RESORT: The Tequila is built among some mature trees and is landscaped nicely. The pool is in the center of the resort, it has two sides to it, one side has the swim-up bar, and the other side seemed to be more for the water aerobics, basketball, and things like that- we stayed on the side with the bar. In between the two sides of the pool is the lunch buffet. The temperature of the water was fine, and very warm by the end of the day in the sun. The weather for us was perfect all week- upper 80's and sunny everyday! The pool bartenders were great, had fun, and worked extremely hard- especially with the arrival of the Spaniards! They serve dos equis beer on tap, and will make any liquor drink you ask for, frozen or not. At night there are shows in the outdoor theater area adjacent to the lobby. The dancers try hard and look good, but it is what it is... The sports bar was great. We are bigtime soccer fans, and when we were at the resort there were many Brits there. It was pretty cool watching the Champions League games with people from Liverpool, Manchester, London, etc. The had mostly soccer on in the sports bar, but also some MLB games and some of the Canucks had hockey on as well. I think if it's on TV, they will try to find it for you. The sports bar is where the resort had about 8 computers for you to use if you wanted to get on the internet. I think it was 8 dollars for an hour of internet use. There is a disco that opens at 11:00- we had a hard time staying up to dance at that time, but we did check it out one night- young crowd for sure. The other Riu resorts did not have much going on at night, and most people seemed to come to the Tequila for the night entertainment. The resort is across the street from the beach, as many have mentioned it is an easy walk and there is a golf-cart shuttle if you are so inclined. OTHER THINGS: The restaurants that you have to get up in the morning to book are not worth it. We did the Japanese and it was just another buffet- we were hoping for the hibachi cooking table thing. We didn't try again. The buffets are more than adequate. If you can't find something to eat, you have problems. The fish was always my favorite along with the guacamole and pico. Fresh and tasty! They had it all. There is a starbucks just outside the resort. You can get a cup of good coffee for 2 bucks instead of the swill (my opinion) they served at the resort. They have wifi in there as well and give you a code to use it with your receipt. Play del Carmen is a 5 dollar cab ride away- nice town, we didn't explore too much- lots of relatively pushy salespeople, the usual Mexican tourist town I thought, but pretty by the beaches. The resort is very safe- it is in Playacar, which is a gated, affluent, community down the road from Playa del Carmen. Overall, the crowd at the Riu had an international flavor- some Americans, more Canadians, lots of Brits and then... the Spaniards arrived. There was a LARGE group of young people who had just graduated from college- about 200 scattered among the 3 or 4 resorts. They were obnoxious on day 1, I think they were all just incredibly happy to be there. They were doing cannonballs into the pool next to the bar, splashing water all over the place, dumping drinks on each other, having a giant fruit fight in the pool with the fruit from all of the drinks. I think the bartenders would have chopped them up into little pieces if they could have... they got extremely hammered, as 22 year old college kids will do, but after that, they seemed to pretty much settle down. We did play the \"towel game\" getting up early to put towels out in prime chairs by the pool. On the 4th day, we arrived after breakfast to find our stuff folded up on a chair with a note from the resort reminding to not reserve chairs- everyone got the same note that day. It is understandable, but if you don't reserve chairs by 7:30 you aren't getting one near the pool. We loved it, had fun, and would go back in a heartbeat.

They don't change your sheets or blankets . I even checked it by leaving a ketchup stain on my blanket one day before the cleaning service came and after they cleaned the room it was still the same blanket with the same stain for two days. On the third day of my stay there was a large roach in my room , nice for a \"five star\" resort huh? My second complaint is the 24/7 all inclusive buffet and food... this is a lie there was no 24/7 food. I woke up at 11 for example missing breakfast i had to wait untill 12:30 to eat something because all the buffets where closed. They have a 24hr snack bar which serves cold nasty sandwiches and cold hamburgers who wants to eat that when you pay close to $1500 per person on vacation. Third of all you are only allowed one beach towel per day no matter what if your towel gets dirty they dont carel they tell you only one towel per day. Furthermore the first 3 day I had to wait an hour just to get a towel. If you want to make a reservation for one of their restuarants you have to wake up t 6:30 am just to make a reservation. Who wants to wake up at 6:30am when they are on vacation. The only good thing I can say about Riu Tequila is that the resort itself is beautiful , the beach is also breath taking .

Fruit (cut up) in the sports bar for take out great to keep in room for snacks. Shuttle to beach, the walk is fine and beautiful, however, if you play as hard as I do you may find yourself using the shuttle more to save your energy for the ocean and/or sports activities. Shuttle does not run from 1-3 p.m. Resort, after seeing the Yucatan was overly crowded at breakfast (poor design too narrow of walk ways) and the Playacar's pool did not compare I would book the Tequila again. Drinks, always cold, specify name brands if you prefer them, they will make anything you ask for with a smile. Wines to me were awful. Wildlife, (not their real names) saw lots of squirrel rats and iguana's? along with birds at Tequila however, the humpback no tails were at the Yucatan and along the beach path. The monkeys were on the walk way that runs outside of the main lobby (at the Yucatan) to the pool next to the towel hut. A baby came down to play with us, we just talked to him for a while and he came down. Internet, $3or $4 for 15 minutes, however, if you get a riu club card from their site online, it is half price, it is in the sports bar. Shows, were O.K., we enjoy it more when it is audience participation such as the best couple. We did catch most of the Michael Jackson one at the Yucatan, it was O.K. the preshow was better as they had men from the audience trying to imitate him. Sports bar enjoyed the quiet of it in the morning and Celis (Actually Veronica) was very helpful with questions about the area, of course it had drinks, coffee, cappicino and hot chocolate etc. Yucatan, seemed more happening during the day with dances and activities. Playacar, had a better lunch it was worth the walk, be sure you have shirt, shoes and skirt or wrap, I don't think they let you in with bikini bottoms but swim shorts were O.K. Beach, was decent but we did walk to the right for about 1/2 mile to enjoy the sand bag free view, some rocks and a beautiful leaning palm to take pictures on. Ocean, only two yellow flag days, the first day was so rough I was not sure I wanted to be there. I did not verify it but some people claim there had been several drownings due to the sand bags, they may look fun but stay off the ones out deep especially. Activities, wish I had joined in on some earlier, it's more fun when you know the people and staff a little better, also wish I had checked out the kids club earlier, the one day I did with my 11 year old it was very fun and she made friends. Sunscreen, was much cheaper at the stores on the driveway leading to the Yucatan then right in the resort. $12 for a large bottle.

We filled the room with MSU fans and they brought several bartenders in to accomodate us all. The walk to the beach was not bad, esp. since there is a shuttle that can take you there and back if you don't want to walk. If you take the route on the other side of the Riu Yucataan, you can see all the monkeys and little baby monkeys swinging in the trees! The rooms were fine once the air conditioning and fan were on...otherwise, with the climate, it can get quite damp. We were further in the back of the complex, so we saw a lot of wild life and it was nice and quite. Next time, I'd like to stay closer to to the pool and restaurants.

This was our 8th all-inclusive, and we have stayed at a few Iberostar's, a couple of Sunscape's, Majestic Colonial DR, and Grand Palladium Kentanah. This was our longest stay and we loved the Riu Tequila. We stayed in a Jr.Suite which we loved and would recommend, it was quite spacious, the main room was about 35'x16', had 2 double beds for me and my wife and we had 2 single beds brought in for the 2 kids. The room comes with the TV seating area. I cant imagine having 2 people in a double bed and I am not that large, but do like to spread out. We left a $4 tip each day and the rooms were kept very clean by the staff, daily towel animals. The A/C did not cool that well, I did call for them to check it out but they said it was fine. With that and the ceiling fan it was not so bad. It was very hot and humid for most of our trip. The resort grounds are well landscaped and very clean. The resort size is not as large as some of the other resorts we have stayed at but that was actually a good thing. You didnt have to walk a 1/2 mile to get to dinner or a show. It was also good for our kids that are 12 & 9. We felt safer that they were able to venture up to the sports bar for some games and food and not worry that they would get lost like they have at the IB LaParaiso DelMar and the Kentannah, the resort size is similar to the IB Haciendo Dominicus in LaRomana. We had heard prior to the trip that the Riu's staff was stuffy and not very friendly, which is not what we had found there at all. It was actually quite the opposite, they probably had the friendliest staff that we have encountered. At the bar look for Veronica and ask for a Choco-Loco, we made the drink up and its delicous, it is a chocolate milk shake with or without alcohol, You will have to ask her because the others will not know what it is. She was at the swim up bar, but they switch around weekly. The shows here were much better than the shows that we had seen at all the other resorts and the 2 other resorts that you can share grounds with show up for the nightly shows. We had breakfast and dinner at the buffet restaurant which was huge and always had a large variety to choose from. We thought the food was great. We ate lunch at the pool buffet which had burgers, hot dogs, chicken and pasta, also salads, fruits and more. Our vacation was mostly spent under the tiki umbrellas at the pool and swim-up bar, we brought the munchies to our umbrella and gave the animals around a little. The pool was the warmest out of all the resorts we had stayed at, and it was good depth so that we didnt need to worry about the kids, but deep enough that it wasnt up to your belly. I was a little dissappointed that the SportsBar games were expensive, the pool table costs $3 a game, the air hockey $2 and there were a few video games. Internet was also $8 an hour. These were all located at the Sports bar which we found out was actually owned by an outside company so you cant really blame Riu for that. The kids did enjoy the ping pong by the pool, and the air rifle shooting daily. We did enjoy the place very much.", "Date": "April 14, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Staffordshire", "Title": "\u201cFirst class holiday\u201d", "Author": "MedsecStaffordshire", "ReviewID": "UR28027620", "Content": "Just returned this morning from this lovely hotel. After reading all the other reviews and taking some of them with a pinch of salt, here is my review. The transfer from the airport was smooth as smooth can be, we arrived in the hotel grounds and the valets were waiting to take our cases. A large table was laid out in the foyer with envelopes containing your room key. Each envelope had your name on it. You were handed this and a small map and then proceded to find the room. The valet came later with your luggage. When we booked at the travel agents, we did specify that we would prefer a higher floor but it turned out that we were given a ground floor room. At first my husband was a bit annoyed as we do really prefer being higher up however, on entering our room, we found it to be just perfect. We overlooked the golf course (room 2604) and it was extremely peaceful. We had palm trees outside our terrace and the smell from the newly mown grass at the golf course was wonderful! The room itself was a tad dark but that made not a jot of difference to us as the size and facilities in the room more than made up for this. The beds are two doubles, with one huge headboard. All the furniture was dark wood (perhaps this contributed to the darkness) and there was plenty of drawer space. At the side of the beds we had a small bedside cabinet with two drawers in each. There were two chairs and a small glass topped table. We had a large dressing table with 5 drawers and the television sat on top of this. At the side of this was the case stand. We had three lamps on the wall and one standard lamp at the side of the window. The window itself had a fly screen so it was possible to sit with the window open in the morning with the fly screen shut. However, as is standard in most air conditioned rooms, the windows do need to be closed to enable the air conditioning to work, and work it did! The room was so lovely and cool. We also had a ceiling fan which gave off some coolness if the air conditioning proved to be a bit too chilly!. There was an alcove in the room which was curtained off and held back by tie backs. In this alcove was the dressing room, loo, shower and sink. The wardrobes were here too and contrary to an earlier report, we did not find it caused any problem with dampness. There was a hairdryer, iron and ironing board. There were the optics containing tequila, brandy, rum and vodka. The fridge was stocked up every other day and consisted of 4 beers, two cokes, two orangeades, two sprite and then cans containing tonic and soda water. More than adequate for two of us. The only thing missing (to my mind anyway) were tea and coffee making facilities. I know it was a 24-hour AI but sometimes the coffee machine by the pool was not working and so a late coffee on the way back to your room was not possible. I would recommend anyone going to take their own kettle. Milk can be stored in the fridge if you fill up a cup in the morning when you go for your breakfast. This is purely a personal thing but it may help some other like minded people. The grounds are just lovely!. It is like walking through small palm tree lined streets It was peaceful and never rowdy. Occasionally late arrivals would be a bit loud, but to be honest, that did not bother us as they were probably just as excited to arrive as we were!. The swimming area did get a bit packed but later in the day there were some sun beds available. However, if you are a pool person, perhaps it is a good idea to get up early and \"bag\" your beds - not to my taste but I prefer the beach everytime. The swim up bar was good too. The pool on this side did not seem to be deep and to my knowledge was the same depth all around. The day we walked around the pool, the other pool seemed to be geared up to water sports. There always seemed to be somthing going on, whether it be basketball in the pool or keep fit on the sandy area. It was always well used either way. The entertainment was good too although we did tend not to stay in for the shows. On the occasions we did, the theatre area was always packed, so it must have been worth watching. The dancers were very good I must say. In the foyer itself were lots of comfortable sofas and chairs. The were set around an \"atrium\" with a fountain in the middle. Inside the atrium were sofas all around the fountain. There was a small wrought iron fence around thes area and on the outside were tables, with sofas and chairs. It was very very pleasing! There was a small shop selling various items but to my mind this was a tad expensive. To one side of the foyer were the travel companies selling trips. We were with Thomsons and used our rep to book trips, but there were other reps selling trips too, one being Apple Vacations and this was staffed by a young English lad called Ian. He was lovely to speak to and was quite knowledgable. Of course you don't have to use any reps to book your trips as there are other ways of doing this. However, I know that the reps don't always earn much (my son being a holiday rep for 9 years) and do depend on selling trips to get the commission, so again it is a personal choice, bit I do tend to book at least one if not two trips with the rep. The food I thought was extremely good. Ok so it may have been a bit repetitive but there was so much choice for it not to be a problem (to us anyway). Lets face it, who has that much choice in their own home over a two week period! There is lots to eat and the staff were lovely. The resort itself is small (playacar shops being a 5-10 minute walk away depending on how mobile you are. We did take a walk to Playa Del Carmen and it was a good 30 minute walk - not recommended in the heat as there is not much shade, but a change from lying on the beach. 5th Avenue itself we thought to be quite pricey. It is obviously geared up for tourists and most of the shops sell the same touristy stuff (sombreros, sarongs, etc). We went to Cozumel on the ferry for a couple of hours and I found this to be a bit cheaper with more \"normal\" shops that had prices displayed for you to see, no hassling to try and get you to see their shop from the inside. I know this is the norm but to be honest it gets on my nerves as all I sometimes want to do is to window shop. I could go on and on about this place as there are too many things to mention, suffice it to say that this is one lovely hotel and has been one of the very best holidays I have had. No complaints whatsoever. Can't be fairer than than! I am quite envious of anyone going in the next few days/weeks.

We were actually surprised about how comfortable the beds were, given all the complaints from previous reviews. The sleeping area was decorated nice and very clean. My only complaint was the toilet/shower. The toilet didn't flush properly, there was a sewer smell most of the time. When we showered, the whole area flooded so we would use our bath towels to soak it up. There were also alot of mosquitos, so bring repellent! Restocking the mini fridge seemed to be a problem, since it was not restocked often we would have to call to get soda and beer, and it would be warm when it arrived. Housekeeping was great always early, love the towel animals!

We were never around to see much of the shows, although our son got to participate in a mini production of Grease at the Yucatan, which was so much fun! He had a blast. The kids club was good, the staff were so nice. The beach was nice, always a place to sit, water was beautiful. Wish there was drink service. Sandbags were odd, but there for a reason. They do create weird currents so be careful! My son and husband were out waist deep and they got sucked under by a whirlpool. The walk to the beach is pleasant, not far at all. There is food and beer at the Yucatan beach club. I noticed a really bad garbage smell by the beer tap, so bad that we stopped getting beer there. Also the bathrooms smelled really really bad up there. But over all we had a great time at the beach, absolutely beautiful! We only went to the pool once, there was no place to sit and sometimes the pool looked murky. Definately not my favorite all inclusive so far, but also not a disappointment.

I'll get the bad part over first: the front desk. They are totally useless! We had an issue with a lost passport and they were of no help at all. We kept getting different information depending on who you talked to. One gal said we had to make a police report, another said we had to go to the consulate, and no one bothered to find out what the actual procedure was. I mentioned that maybe it was left in a bathroom at the Cancun airport, and the front desk clerk gave me the phone number of the airport! I called on my cell ($1.00 a minute!!) and got a spanish recording. She never offered to make the call for me. Thank goodness for our transport co. (Cancun Valet). I called to see if we left it in the van; he said it wasn't there, but to call back in 10 minutes. I called back and he had all the info. we needed to get a new passport. He was so nice; I don't know what we would have done without him. It was a fairly easy process and I think the front desk should have answers to questions like that. The corporate office will be hearing from me. Back to the good stuff: the hotel is very, very nice and I can't say enough about the rest of the staff. Very friendly and helpful. I do have to agree with the other reviews that the food does get a little boring. It was very good and plenty of it, however. I could have lived off the guacalmole and fresh fruit.

Instead, I'll try to compare with our last AI experience at the Iberostar Del Mar (which we enjoyed as well.) Here's the kicker: we saved about $2k USD on this trip vs. our last one to Iberostar (2 years ago.) Was the experience that much cheaper as well? Let's take a look... We were amazed at the food quality. My wife thinks it was better than IB, and I think I agree for the buffets. Everything was just a bit fresher - all fresh ingredients, never felt recycled. We didn't bother with the specialty restaurants as the buffet had enough variety to please us all. (Well, the kids ate pizza and fries every day - so much for variety. Hey, it's their vacation too, so we mostly let it slide.) The IB specialty restaurants were more varied and quite good, so this one's a wash. I loved the beach - the walk is no worse than we had at the Iberostar - it just happens to be not within the resort! The IB was so huge that it took 10 minutes to get to the beach from our room anyway; the Tequila is \"quaint\" in comparison, and the resulting walk out of the resort, across the street, and down the resort-like path is no issue for us. The beach itself I feel had way better seating - lots of chairs both in the sun and under trees. (I LOVE sitting under palm trees... isn't that what it's all about?) Advantage: Tequila! I agree with last reviewer - good friendly service and smiles from everyone. This is factor #1 for us, as it makes it easy to relax and enjoy good vibes on vacation. I remember IB being this way too... maybe it's just Mexico? Love 'em both. The room was just fine. Layout is decent, but our 2nd floor unit had horrible air conditioning. It barely got the room below 78F, and it wasn't even that hot out! Talking to another couple, this wasn't necessarily the norm as their unit got quite cool at night. I told the front desk, who was very nice (and smiley) in saying they'd take care of it, but it never really got better. We should have switched rooms, but I was too lazy to repack the suitcases, so we toughed it out. A cool breeze was ever-present later in the week, so we cracked open the slider and enjoyed al-fresca aire acondicionado. A helpful tip: don't store your used beach towels in the room overnight - the humidity coupled with the weak AC makes it funky in the room. Turn them in for your card, or put them on the balcony. IB gets the nod here. The grounds were very clean and tropical, but not quite as \"grand\" as we have experienced at Iberostar. I think IB focuses a bit more on aesthetics, with more water and ground features. We just had nice pathways with a few fake relics to complement the tropical scene. IB Quetzal across the street, however, had an incredible wooden deck pathway over a rock waterfall that made it seem like a tropical island. Very cool - I'd like to try that place out. IB wins. Whether it's worth the extra $$... well, depends on your values. The IB pools are also much larger (grander) in general. Again, this place was quaint, and suited our needs for a relaxing vacation with our 2 young'uns (10 and 12.) Even though I'm sure they were mostly sold-out for spring break, we never had trouble getting chairs suitable for us (some sun and some shade), even if we arrived at the pool at a late hour (10:30.) I never did feel crowded at the pool or beach. At meals, it only felt crowded to us once or twice (Monday night Mexican dinner had huge lines - don't go at 7:30!) I definitely recommend this place for what it is: a great value for a family vacation. If you're flexible, and don't place huge stock in tiny details, you can make yourself a great experience here. If tiny details bother you... you'll be on here writing about this and that. Save your time - and pony up the $$ (probably double) somewhere else. As for me - I don't know what I'll do next time! I like elegance, but I also like money. I'll probably end up trying yet another place in a few years. But if I get another great deal on the Tequila, I won't hesitate to come back.

I have to take into account that this was a very busy time and the hotel was full or close to it many days during our stay. This is our 2nd AI stay, having always stayed in condos when previously visiting the area. We choose AI for the convienence of keeping our 7 year old happy (I don't want to do any work on vacation). Last year we stayed at the Catalonia Tulum. The difference in the service we received at Tequila is like night and day. To a person, everyone is helpful and kind. You ask, the answer is yes. It may not happen right away, but it will be done. Rui could give lessons in good service. In itself, this was probably the greatest determining factor of our satisfaction. I had read the reviews and was prepared for the hike to the beach and the sand whales. To be honest, it did deter me from visiting the beach more often. Yes it is only 7 minutes or so, but it just isn't very convienent. I also thought the Yucatan was more crowded and hectic. The playacar was just, well, tacky...I cannot fault the Tequila for this, as I was aware of the situation and choose it anyways. I did agree with lots of posters though, the Tequila is by far the nicest of the two. We even had people from the palace hanging at our pool. The pool area and bar are very nice and it was great to hang out there all day. There was some lounger saving in the morning, but it wasn't a problem most days. I get up early and did the same. I did find the pool resturant pretty weak, though. The selection was limited and some of the food was simply not very good. I love breakfast, so it wasn't a big deal. Speaking of which, the food. The first two nights I remarked to my husband, how is it possible that people could not like the food here? There is a lot of variety and it was good. BUT, by the end of the week, I was eating salad for dinner. For some unknown reason, the selection and quality was very different during the week than compared to the weekend. I was surprised to find it rather monotonous also. The service was always good and if you sat outside, it was quite pleasant. For some reason they also have the lights on full brightness for dinner and between the light and the noise, it feels like a cafeteria with tableclothes. We found the outside seating to be very pleasant and the waitstaff great. We only tried one resturant, the steakhouse. The cesar salad was one of the best I have ever had, the rest unmemorable at best. I did see lines occassionnally in the morning for reservations, but they were the exception and I did not have to wait at all to get ours. The rooms are basic, but fine. I didn't expect more. Our housekeeper was wonderful. My son loves the towel art and she outdid herself each day surprising him. I was really pleased she took the time to do so and tipped her accordingly.

Check-in - Best we've experienced. No queueing. Just collect key in envelope, place stickers with room number on bags and that's it. Luggage delivered to our room a little later. Room - clean room and nice size. 2 small doubles pushed together. Good shower and separate WC. Room well furnished, TV, 2 chairs and table, fridge and mini-bar, balcony. Hotel - Rooms in small 2 storey blocks in tropical gardens. Swimming pool and restaurant in central position. Plenty of sunbeds round pool and swim-up bar a nice feature. Beach accessed through dedicated walk-way and there is a shuttle service running all day. Food - Main buffet restaurant had pleasant outside eating area. Plenty of variety, quality varied but usually something to be enjoyed every meal. Lunches taken at pool restaurant. Speciality restaurants - steakhouse, forgettable starter but nice rib-eye. Mexican located near beach via walk-way. Excellent starters but mains disappointing. Asian - wide choice of sushi and food better standard than average Chinese in UK. Bars - 2 near entertainment area were OK. Drinks quality varied. Often had to ask for more spirit so as to taste it. Bar near swimming pool quiet but little atmosphere in the evening. Outdoor drinking area needed near pool. Beach - Could use beach next to Riu Yucatan or Playacar. Plenty of sunbeds and shade under palm trees. Large sandbags in sea to prevent erosion, however these are maturing in appearance and look little different to rocks. Facilities of other hotels - Could eat lunch at Riu Yucatan and Playacar and use pools, bars and entertainment all day. Pleasant pools but all could get noisy at times. Drink quality generally better at Yucatan but lunch time food far less choice and poorer quality, however, we understand the main buffet restaurant was a better option. Playacar lunches by far the best of the 3 hotels. Trips - We did Chichen Itza, Tulum and Coba. All interesting and plenty more to do should we return, eg Xcaret and Xel-Ha. Prices vary so shop around. Conclusion - Tequila a pleasant place to stay with few real negatives. When we were there in March all 3 hotels were overrun by Spring breakers from Canada and US. Can get very noisy and crowded at times. It became very difficult to book speciality restaurants particularly when people were queueing at 6 am and booking for 19 people. Many people complained and the hotel put a stop to this. Would we go back? Too many other places to see. If we return to Mexico we might try a smaller hotel.", "Date": "April 5, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, Canada", "Title": "\u201cBest week ever!\u201d", "Author": "malibukiki", "ReviewID": "UR27316613", "Content": "We stayed at the Riu Tequila from March 20th to March 27th. Booked through Sunquest and overall things went quite smoothly. This was our first trip to somewhere tropical so we weren't sure what to expect but heard great things about this resort. Once we arrived in Cancun, it was quite easy to find our shuttle to the resort - just keep walking past anyone that doesn't have a Sunquest shirt on - my boyfriend ended up talking to a timeshare representative for over 10 min (too polite to walk away!). Once we arrived at the Riu Tequila (45-1 hr drive) check in was seamless, everything was ready for us. If you are arriving late in the evening try to catch the dinner buffet before it closes (10 pm) otherwise you're heating up burgers at the sports bar. Didn't find any difficulty finding our building as they have well-lit signs everywhere along the path. The hallways were also well lit - the locks are a little tricky at first but once you get the hang of them they're fine. Rooms Our room was actually better than I thought it would be! It was spotless with the fan & AC already on so there was no musty smell. There are lots of drawers with is great as well as a very spacious closet. The only thing that I wasn't expecting was that the floors could get a little damp (they are tile and it can be very humid during the day). So I would just wear my flip flops and not leave anything on the floor - not a big deal. Unfortunately we only got one towel art during our stay but our maid was great and even organized our shoes! We stayed in building 10. Food/Restaurants Overall I thought the food was excellent. We went with another couple and never had a problem finding things we liked. If anything we went up for seconds quite frequently. There is a large variety of different types of food as well as some authentic mexican dishes. It's one of the biggest adjustments coming back home - not having already cooked meals at the scheduled times! Never had any problems with the food not being warm/cold. I guess the only negative thing was that more often than not we forgot to grab utensils! Bars Definately the pool bar was the favourite amongst our group. The bartenders were great, very fun and will have your drinks ready for you when you go up. In the evening we mainly used the bar in the courtyard as the sports bar was crowded with kids on spring break. The sports bar is open all night so you'll never be left thirsty! We avoided the disco as it was during spring break period and the unfortunate side of being able to use the other resorts is that all the kids came to the Tequila after 11 to go to the disco. Nonetheless it did provide some entertainment once the shows were over. Entertainment The entertainment staff work tirelessly to ensure that everyone is having a great vacation. The nightly shows definately were entertaining and we made sure not to miss them. At the end of the week we started to wonder if they got days off since we saw them everywhere. You will find you can't get their signature song out of your head by the time the week is done. Pool/Beach Wonderful pool that is always being cleaned. The only downside is that it is separated by the lunch buffet and there is only one side with a swim up bar. So we spent our time on that side even though the other side seemed a bit nicer and was definately less crowded. The only time that we had problems getting a lounger was our last day as there were people that just arrived so it was unsually busy at the pool. It was a little chilly as you first get in but then is beautiful. The beach is not far at all - never had to take the beach cart because it was a nice walk. 10 minutes top. If you want a nice treat try walking through the Yucatan resort - they have monkeys in their trees. Was an unexpected surprise! The beach is beautiful, even with the sandbags. There are tons of loungers for the Riu guests. If you walk to the left from the Beach club it gets less crowded as most people tend to hang around the Yucatan. Never really had any problems with people trying to sell us anything etc. If you want some great scenic pictures if you walk further down the beach (to the right past the Yucatan) there are no sandbags after all the resorts. Excursions/Trips We only did one trip through our hotel - the Coba Mayan Adventure with Alltournative. While we had a good time, we wouldn't do a tour in the future. We only got one hour at Coba and then the rest of the time was spent driving around to a zip line & cenote. Next time we will just go to Coba on our own to go at our own pace and not having to follow a scheduled timeline. We also didn't really feel the cost reflected what you got. With that being said, we did purchase tickets to Xel-Ha through our Sunquest rep - great because it was an open ticket so we could go on whatever day we chose. We took a taxi there and back because with the four of us it worked out to be cheaper instead of paying the extra $45 to use the tour bus. This way we were able to leave when we wanted to as well. Xel-Ha was a great day - plenty of stuff to do for everyone. Great for beginner snorkelers - there are lots of fish and you don't need a guide or anything like that. We also did an unadvertised trip to the Jungle Place monkey sactuary. It was something I found about on tripadvisor and I'm so glad that I was able to make an appointment. It was an amazing experience that made the trip. Definately look it up on here and make sure you book early! Shopping/PDC We walked into town and then either walked back or took a taxi. The walk was lovely and it's very safe. There's even an aviary on the way into town that you can see parrots & flamingoes. We didn't explore too much - just did 5th avenue and walked on the beach. Had lunch at Senor Frogs which overlooks the ocean & the ferry pier. Definately make exploring PDC a must do! It's very safe, we even went out to the Blue Parrot and walked 5th avenue at 3 am! There's also a small shopping complex right beside the Tequila which comes in handy for last minute souvenirs and anything that you might have forgotten (they have a drugstore/bank etc). Every other night there were some vendors on the resort however they are usually priced higher than elsewhere. Definately barter! Money Definately do a little research before hand to make sure you are getting a good exchange rate. Since I have a Scotiabank account I was able to withdraw money at their ATM's for no charge. This way we were able to use pesos which more often than not worked out to be a better deal. That being said make sure you know what the conversion is and if you are taking a taxi get the price quoted in pesos instead of US so you know exactly how much it will be. The hotel will break large bills for you if need be. Overall it was a great vacation and I would definately recommend this hotel. Our only downside was that we went in March when there were a lot of kids on spring break. Don't worry about the travel advisory for Mexico - you are very far away from the border problems. Just have common sense like you would in any other major city in north america. Never once did I think I was in danger! If you are interested in golfing there is a great golf course on the same street as the resort. Your tour rep can call and get you a tee time almost any day that you want. They started late (1 pm or so) to save some money with the green fee and were still able to play all 18 holes. They take pictures for you and you get a nice compilation at the end which I thought was a nice touch. PS don't forget to bring some long-sleeved shirts/sweaters for the evening - it can get chilly!

Best Riu in the area, as there are three. Tequila is situated further from the beach, but just a short pleasant walk or mini train. We were able to get meals and drinks at the other hotels during the daytime. The hotel and rooms were spotless, although we shared our room with giant mosiquitoes, which hide in the net curtains, most intelligent mosquitoes I have encountered, we tried to attract them to the bathroom light,but they were too smart for us, only got rid of them when we sprayed the room. The first room we had was on the ground floor with a view of the toilet block, so changed to the upper floor which gave us a better view, rooms a little old fashioned but I suppose it was meant to give the old Mexican atmosphere. We had a problem with our safe, which was free to use, the pin number we entered worked for a few days and then mysteriously it didn't work, the only conclusion I could come to was that 'someone' had tried several combinations to gain access. It was opened with the master key, we had no further problems, quite a number of other guests also encountered this problem. The food was good in the main restaurant, not the variety that I had expected though, the Chinese restaruant was my favourite with sushi and plenty of other oriental dishes, 'do try the fried icecream' it sounds awful, but it was to die for. The Mexican was much the same as the main restaurant. We didn't try the steakhouse as my partner is veggy. The cocktails were lush and the bar staff didn't need a tip to prompt them to serve us, in fact they encouraged us to drink up to have another! In the reps meeting we were introduced to the senior staff, which I thought was good, as you knew who to complain to if needed. All the staff were ready to please and nothing was too much trouble for them. On Valentine's night the women were given a red rose and champers in the restaurant, in the room was a teddy with chocolates and another red rose. The beach was a lovely white powder sand, but it was littered with cigarette ends. There didn't seem to be anyone bothered about removing them, although there was no litter. The sea is very rough most of the time, huge black sandbanks have been placed in the sea to prevent the beach being washed away, which has happened to the other hotels either side of the Riu. The entertainment in the evening was very good, there is a resident troupe of professional dancers, who put on a different show every night. The sister hotel 'Yucatan' seemed to have better entertainment in the daytime and was situated near the beach, they also had a nicer pool area overlooking the sea, which anyone staying at the three Riu hotels could use. Playa Del Carmen was a 20 minute walk on the flat which was very pleasant, a taxi cost about 5 dollars. It was safe to walk about. Just a few hundred yards from the hotel is a bank, a few tourist tat stall/shops, Jewellers and two places to book trips, which are just the same as the reps trips but cheaper. I bought a few things from a Mayean village, during a trip, which were much cheaper than the resort shops. We went to Cobra which cost $69 each, we visited a village where we were introduced to the little girl who appeared in the film 'Apocolypse' which told the story of the brutal sacrifice of slaves, which was based on true facts! We visited one of the pyramids where the sacrifices took place, we swam in a cave deep underground. Lunch was included in the price, I thought it was a good deal. The resort seemed a bit artificial, with fabulous individually designed houses, (\u00a31,000,000 plus) there is nothing of the real Mexico there. Would I go back to Mexico, yes, but a different resort and a different airline, we did not get a meal or drink until about five hours into the flight, 30 minutes before the meal came, a trolley full of junk food was brought around and everyone spent a fortune filling up on pringles, chocolate and sweets, of course the cabin staff get comission on these sales.

This makes me think our experience was unusual though my other half wouldn't let me complain about it as he said all the rooms were probably all the same. Basically, our room was humid to the point of being damp and I think unhealthy (we have both returned home with the worst colds we have had in years). When I first entered the room it smelt really musty , but we'd been warned it was a humid climate and the Thomson rep referred to this and that we must all keep the aircon on all the time - which we did. Nevertheless, it was somewhat unpleasant sleeping in such a damp atmosphere. The sheets felt damp and all our clothes became damp. I brought out a pack of chewing gum which I kept in my drawer and after a couple of days the gum had turned to mush! We chose this resort over others because it had been refurbished in Autumn 2008 and so we thought it would be nice and fresh. By and large the rest of the hotel did look like it may have been refurbished, but certainly not our room which had small areas of mould on the walls which got more widespread as the fortnight passed. I can only think they must wash the walls down in between clients. No pun intended but the room put a real dampener on our holiday particularly to come home feeling so ill.

We have been to other Riu hotels in Jamaica and in DR, and they actually all look the same. Riu Tequila had a kind of older feeling especially when compared with a beautiful Riu Ocho Rios in Jamaica. We had a great time, weather was beautiful, so it was perfect couple of days. If you only stay in resort, I think one week is maximum, the food is very repetitive so you actually can get bored with all they have to offer. We tried all their restaurants: Steak Restaurant: don't order steak, get shrimp kebab instead of bbq ribs :-) Asian - nothing special, but you must try their fried tempura ice cream, Mexican - nice location by the beach, I wished they could have good fajitas or good burritos..unfortunately menu not so much with a mexican feel.. Drinks - great! order Tequila Bum Bum :-))) Shows - OK..but even my kid got bored with the same scheme of a mini disco :-) Karoake on Saturday was the most boring, couples show the best :-) Walk to the beach is a very nice pathway...we would be more than happy to take a walk but our son demanded that he will only take a ride in this cart that goes every 15 minutes :-) Beach - nice but lots of sand bags...maybe a little they were ruining the view but water was gorgeous! Beach was also too crowded same goes to the entire hotel, you had to wait in line to get your food, to make reservation or to get a drink..but that's actually not a big deal since they were moving fast :-) and on vacation you shouldn't be in a hurry :-)) We loved the fact that you can walk to other hotels, actually we spent most of our days at Yucatan, great pool and more action :-) and right on the beach. Would I come back to this hotel? Probably not, because I love to see new places since there is so much too see, but it provided us with a great time and a great value for our money. My advice, don't pay more money to get the beachfront Riu (Yucatan or Playacar) since you can eat your lunch and spend the entire day in the these hotels....

I went with my parents and a few of their friends as my husband was stuck home in Canada. Food: Breakfast - I'm not much of a breakfast person, so I only ate it twice. From what I saw there was plenty of selection. Healthy alternatives were readily available including yogurt, fresh juice, fruit, eggs, whole wheat and multi-grain bread. I am a coffee drinker; the coffee at this resort was mediocre at best. Luckily there is a Starbucks a 3 minute walk away from the resort that accepts American dollars. Lunch - Served at the restaurant at the pools. A well stocked salad bar, bread (for those that like sandwiches) and hot food as well. I do not eat red meat but still found lots of fish for protein. Supper - I tried all 3 restaurants available: buffet, mexican and asian. They were all good and again offered several choices for me (semi-healthy eater + no meat). I ate about 10 pieces of sushi at the asian restaurant and suffered no ill effects. Alcohol: this is readily available both at the bars and in one's room. Service is fast (faster than in the Dominican) and generally very well done. I tipped once in a while; not for every drink but once or twice an evening. I don't drink beer, but apparently the 'XX' served is ok, but not the best beer. The rum was ok (bacardi) but I had to have some sort of no-name brand irish cream (no Bailey's). Room: my bed was comfortable, smelled nice, was bright. I am a very, very light sleeper and could hear others within the compound but after putting in my earplugs I was ok. Staff: everyone was very friendly and things were done in a timely fashion. The staff are very good at speaking English. Pool: the water sports and activities were frequent enough to break up the day. The water is cold (I didn't go swimming on the days when it was only 23C... but it was nice on the days when it was 28C and sunny) Beach: this is less than a km away from the resort. It is across the road and down a covered path. It feels very safe and is not too far away at all. The shuttle goes constantly and there never seemed to be too many people waiting for it. The sand on the beach is soft with not too much coral or rocks. The water was rough when we were there but the waves were fun to play in. Other: I received two courtesy calls making sure everything in my room was all right. I thought that was very nice. Again, the person on the other end of the line could speak English very well. The nightly entertainment was very good; not cheesy at all. The shows were very good and involved a variety of different dance. If you go to this resort, do the dance at the end.. it is fun. You feel silly but you are there to have fun, right? Unless you love kids DO NOT GO during Ontario's March break. On our last night, the resort was inundated with children. They were yelling, screaming, running around everywhere. I would say about 2/3 of the resort were from Canada. Try some of the dance lessons at the pool. Hilario is an amazing dancer and not a bad teacher either. (have a drink or two first) Another thing: the 3 Riu resorts, paradiso and sandals resorts are all within a very nice/wealthy gated neighborhood. Only tourists and resort workers are in this area. I went running within the neighborhood most mornings by myself and felt very safe. (it was a titch hot though!)

AMAZING We just got back 5 hours ago and I new I had to come write a review cause we could not have had a better vacation. I was one of those people who read review after review for weeks & days before we left. So I will write as much as I can to help you out!! The Rooms The room are small but there was only two of us so it was perfect. We were on the ground floor and had a lovely patio with a view of a garden it was towards the back of the resort I liked the walk \u2026. Work off those calories lol. There was tons of light in the hallway & by our door to see the key hole. I have read a review before I went that they didn\u2019t have enough light maybe it was burnt out \u2026. The room does not have a bath tub just a stand up shower with a lovely removable shower head we had tones of water pressure I had to keep it on low when brushing my teeth it had so much force & tones of hot water as well I mostly took cold ones it was nice after the hot days. We had a beer called XX in our room we even made friends with the beer guy and we were getting 10 beer a day dropped off at 5pm it was great. The Staff Well I had also read a review that you never seen them there was nothing to do during the day and such. Well we seen the animation staff all day everyday running around the pool getting people up playing games Tony & Pablo are amazing at what they do & work very hard they were always getting us up playing games & making us laugh. I always seen people cleaning everything & everywhere to be exact never had a problem with sticky bars or anything of that matter. They work every hard a the buffets as well there are so many people coming and going from them there always sweeping the floors, cleaning the tables & keeping food out on the buffets. The Bars There in a lobby bar this one is very busy in the evening the seats get taking early in the night. There is also a theater bar that is open in the evening when the shows are going on try a tequila boomboom from there!! Then there is the gator sports bar in the same place it\u2019s the 24hr bar we found we got the best drinks from here. As well there is the pool bars swim up & one around the lunch buffet. There is a disco & I think it is open Thursday, Friday & Saturday since that was when I noticed that they took the kids in for a mini disco. I never made it to the disco I was way to tired by the time the shows where done. Food The food was pretty good I am not very picky & my boyfriend is we always found things to eat. This is one thing I wish someone would have wrote where you eat breakfast in the lobby buffet you will eat supper here as well but not lunch. Lunch will be by the pool in that buffet. If you want to eat at the Al A Carts we did the Asian & Stake house I did not find either anything to write home about but it was nice to get dressed up and have a sit down meal. What we did love was the desserts at both Asian had deep fired ice cream we though about making a reservation just to be able to eat that. I will say be careful about the food in the snack bar it is in the gator sports bar. When we were getting ready to leave the buffet was not open yet & my boyfriend went and got two burgers that were in the fridge & heated them up well he got food poisoning we didn\u2019t even make it to the airport & he was sick so please be careful of the meat in the snack bar. I ate the fruit in the snack bar and never had a problem. The beach I also read that there were complaints of the this resort not being on the beach well if you did your research you would know that it is not on the beach. It is just a short walk across the street & down a lovely gated walk way were you will see lizards & monkeys in the trees. There is a trolley that runs from 7am till 1pm & again from 3pm till 6pm if you don\u2019t want to walk it will take you. There is a bar there as well as a buffet for lunch so there is no need to go back to the tequila to get some lunch. Yes there are sand bags in the water not great to look at but they are there for a reason to help keep the beach in good shape you can walk to you right past the hotels & there will be no more sand bags. There are people on the beach trying to get you to go parasailing & jet skiing if you tell them no they will leave you alone we never had a problem we didn\u2019t have locals asking us to buy anything nor did I see any & we spent every day at the beach pretty much it was lovely. The Shows They do work very hard & the pre show games were the best past but once again nothing to write home about it was a lot of ballet. The best show was the Horror Show we loved it and laughed the entire show!!! The Town We went in to Playa Del Carmen 2 times it is a $5.00US cab ride don\u2019t let them try to charge you more. I was lovely there as well lots of places to eat & shop there is even Wal \u2013 Mart. There is now Coco Bongos & Senior Frogs in Playa del Carmen that makes if nice if you enjoy those places. Please to be careful when buying silver I bought a bracelet the man told me he had to \u201cweigh\u201d it to get me the price he said $58.00US I got him down to $20.00US. I bought it and went to a local bar to grab a beer took it out of the bag he gave it to me in. It was not what I had bought nor was the 9.25 inside to confirm it was real silver I did luck out I went back and confronted the man in his store & I got the one that I had \u201cthought\u201d I had bought. He did not want me making a scene in his shop as well he could get in lots of trouble.

The rooms themselves aren't fancy, but they're clean, recently updated, and well maintained. Food was excellent, drinks even better. Be sure to try a 'Mexican Flag'. Our only complaint was with SkyService and Pearson Airport. They recommend that you check in 3 hrs in advance, which we did. While we were waiting in the boarding lounge, the baggage handlers had lots of time to rifle through our luggage. Had perfume and a sarong taken from one suitcase, my huband's perscription RayBans from another suitcase, and our camera from what was to be a carry-on, but because I absent-mindedly threw a bottle of suntan lotion in at the last minute and couldn't get past security, had to check as well.

I was not too happy about this because i didnt like where i was moved to!! The view was not great and it was really loud sometimes. On my 5th day they asked if i would like to move rooms after I asked 3 days before that. They would not allow me to look at the room before i made a desicion. I took the move. I have a nice view but there was a bad smell in the room. I decided not to let the rooms get in the way of my vacation. i stayed here for 9 days. the staff was very friendly but i thought they were a little slow sometimes. the pool was very big and relaxing! the beach was great!! the food was really good too!! still mad about the rooms and oonly having a king bed when there were other people in the room after all i relized that I had a great time.

Weather great. Bit cloudy a couple of days but no rain. General: Clean, welcoming, happy and sometimes quite loud hotel. Reception: One of the best I have come across in a Riu, although they are all good. Nothing was too much trouble for these people, and they always had a ready smile. The Reception area is large and airey, with quite a few sitting areas, but not very peaceful as people are passing through all the time. Bedrooms: Again, more than adequate. An interesting thing about them is that the wardrobes were in the bathroom area, which was curtained off from the bedroom. storage space and hangers were more than sufficient. The rooms were quite immaculate and very clean. It was interesting to return every day to see what had been made out of a towel and left on your bed. The beds were large and comfortable, but that is a personal view as everybody has their own view on bed comfort.. Gin, whisky, rum and vodka in the dispensers, again in the bathroom area. fridge filled every 2 days with beer, water and soft drinks. Toiletries filled every day. Balcony with table and two chairs and clothes drying area. Dining: We only used the main restaurant as none of us were prepared to get up in the middle of the night to book a table at the other ones. The food in the main restaurant was more than adequate and you would never come out hungry. Given the size of the hotel and the numbers that must be catered for they did very well in the variety of food. Sometimes a bit on the cool side of warm, and sometimes you had to wait a couple of minuites to get what you wanted replenished. At lunchtime we ate at the beach restaurant where the food was less interesting but adequate. Bars: Can get very busy at night in the main room. Much quicker to get served in the Sports Bar, and the drinks in there are the same as the other bars. Many of the drinks are branded, but for a couple of days they seemed to have run out of a decent brandy and were giving you the stuff that they flambed the sweets with in the restaurant!! Pool: We stayed in the pool area for the first couple of days, but found it difficult to get sun and shade together. The pool area is kept clean and the staff always were ready to sile and say hello. Many activities going on all day in one part of the pool area, but if you go to the other side of the pool it is a lot quieter. Beach: A much better option as far as we were concerned. Lots of shade or lots of sun. Take you pick. Nice to walk along the beach where you could see the sea birds and do a bit of people watching. Sun loungers comfortable but no mattresses if those are what you need. Towels are provided by the hotel and can be changed every day Entertainment: Usual Riu stuff that when it was good, it was very very good but when it was poor it was dire! However in the 2 weeks that we were there they did have a couple of outside acts on that were good. The Riu entertainment staff, as in all their hotels, really do try, but the standard it pretty low. Other hotels: You can visit any of the other hotels in the area except the Palace ones. Interestingly it was surprising to see how many Palace residents came into our hotel, both day and night, so maybe that says something about the Palce hotels. We went in the other Rius' and weren't as impressed but then we may have been a bit biased. Negatives. Only a couple. There were no quiet areas in the hotel. Everything was open plan and it could be very noisy. There were a number of people there who were quite loud and shouted a lot which could get a bit annoying, but they were on holiday as well!!!! Would I go back: No. Nothing to do with the hotel, but an 11 hour flight tends to put a dampener on things. I would recommend the hotel to anyone, except if they like peace and quiet and exceptional food.", "Date": "March 12, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "sask", "Title": "\u201cGreat Time\u201d", "Author": "rjnitro", "ReviewID": "UR26006933", "Content": "we were there mar 2 -9, we got to the airport and sunquest rep was on hand, loaded on to the bus and off to the hotel, check in was simple,and took about 5 minutes,we were greeted with a much needed drink,get to the room and was impressed for a all inclusive,staff was great,, food met all of my expectations,some shows were a bit unique but you have to remember, its the hotel entertainment staff spending long days and nights to keep you happy,bartenders were fantastic, a few pesos go a long way, to get fantastic service, went to the other riu's on the beach, and i wouldnt sacrifice the beachfront riu's for the tequila(never) the food was far superior at the tequila and the service was totyally different,atmosphere was great at the tequila,the others i wouldnt eat there i would wait to go back to the tequila.yeah there is a bit of walking to get around but after eating 3 meals a day you need it. closing comments i met about 6 - 8 people that have been there 5+ times and would never go elsewhere.

It really is an amazing hotel and I would recommend it to anyone. From families, young couples, groups of friends...it has something to offer everyone here! The rooms are a nice size and very clean, the cleaner comes in every morning/afternoon to clean it, they do a good job too. You get clean towels everyday, both for beach and for showering. Also you have drinks dispensers on the wall, and a stocked mini bar (has 7up, orangeade, beer etc) which they change every 2 days. Swimming pools are kept clean, they clean it at night and a man is cleaning it throughout the day. There is a pool bar, the only bad aspect is that you tend to get the drunken groups at the pool bar each day. Not really a problem for me as i found it funny watching them, but sometimes its nice to just relax without the sound of loud people getting drunk. But not a problem as there is another side of the pool you can sit around anyway. Drinks and food are really good at this place. You can also ask for brand names i.e. smirnoff, havana club and you will get it. Bar staff really friendly, especially after tipping them a few times, they remember your order (in fact all the people working in this hotel are really friendly, waiters, animacion team, cleaners etc). There are 3 restaurants, steak house is defo the best but u need to book at 7am for this. Its REALLY good food here. The main buffet restaurant is also really nice, they have a barbeque sometimes too which is good. So much to choose from that you will never be able not to find something. Good quality too. Entertainment is also good, but sometimes does get a little bit boring as its quite samey, they do put a lot of effort into the shows and most of them are really talented!

Check in was the easiest and most hassle free ever and after a 10 hour flight it makes a huge difference. Walking to our room, every single member of staff we encountered and guests too said hola and were so welcoming that we immediately felt relaxed and loved seeing the funny little animals on the way. The room was spotless. A little bit of a squeeze with a cot in it but no biggie as we don't go on holiday to spent it in our room. Stocked minibar and optics a nice touch but to be honest we barely used them as we had cocktails at the beach or around the hotel. The shower was great - very powerful and nice and hot. Our two year old prefers baths so as the shower was large and quite deep we simply added a plug and he splashed away in there quite happily. I ummed and ahed over which of the three rius in this area to book as we booked last minute with Thomson and they were a similar price but we're so glad we picked the Tequila even though it wasn't on the beach. You'd have to be particularly lazy to find getting to the beach a hassle - literally a five minute walk and a pleasant one at that and if you couldn't manage that then the golf buggy would take you. At other resorts, not being at the beach might be a hassle but as you can use the bars, restaurants etc at the Yucatan and the Playacar we found it perfect. I prefered the grounds and the staff at the Tequila and it has a great feel to it. FOOD I've been to quite a few all inclusives so knew not to expect top end food but the Tequila and the other Rius compared favourably. Breakfast is good with plenty of choice and very slick chefs on the egg sections. Lunches and evening meals were good too. There's a good choice and the food is hot. I like good food and didn't find a hell of a lot to complain about. Yes the steak isn't melt in the mouth but I didn't expect prime fillet! The grilled fish was delicious and think we had fish every day as it was cooked to perfection. Salads were lovely and fresh and there were some great vegetable dishes and yummy desserts too. For beach lunches I think the Playacar has the edge over the Yucatan as there was more choice and it was just generally nicer. As far as the bookable restaurants go - we tried the steakhouse which was okay but no better than the buffet really and also the asian buffet restaurant which again was okay but nothing to write home about. I've eaten in some fab asian restaurants so it was never going to compare but then again I didn't expect it too. DRINKS Loved the fact that soft drinks/beer/wine/coffees are available throughout the resorts as self service as in previous hotels it was irritating to have to queue for simply a glass of water. The rose and red wine are drinkable but the white is awful. The cocktails I had were great and mainly stuck to Margaritas (lots) and mudslides which were fab. Found the bar service at the Yucatan much less friendly than at the Playacar and the Tequila for some reason but it was only noticable because the rest of the time they were so brilliant. THE BEACH The beach is lovely - yeah so there are sandbags but given the choice between no beach or a beach with sandbags I know which I'd prefer. The sandbags look much worse along the beach at the Iberostar hotels so the Riu's have the best patch. As I expected the sandbags they really didn't bother me - I was too busy enjoying the beautiful turquoise water and soft sand to notice. Other reviewers have mentioned being hassled by sellers on the beach but apart from a couple asking if we wanted jewellry or trips we were never bothered - simply said no and they left us alone. I never felt hassled or harassed by them at all, everyone has to earn a living after all. We never had a problem finding loungers on the beach or by the pool. Yes, they're quite close together on the beach but moving them is not a major hassle should you so wish. TRIPS We planned to do a few trips but only ended up doing one - heading to Cozumel for the day. My husband actually operates boat trips at home so I'm pretty used to boats but the ferry ride to Cozumel was tough to say the least - very hot and very rocky and lots of sick bags being handed out so be warned! On arrival at Cozumel we were bombarded by sellers and the hustle and bustle wasn't what I expected at all. I thought we would simply jump into a taxi, go to the nearest beach and snorkel but I think we would have been better off staying at Playa Del Carmen as the beach we went to (the one beside Paradise beach) wasn't worth the taxi fare/ferry ride to get to it and to get decent snorkelling we would have had to take another boat ride. In order to use a sunbed there was a minimum spend at their restaurant/bar for pretty mediocre stuff on an okay beach. We had planned to go to Xcaret in our second week when my parents arrived but as they only had a weeks break they were happy chilling out instead. It's supposed to be great though. ALL IN ALL We had a great trip and nothing really to complain about other than the odd mossy bite which is to be expected when you're surrounded by jungle though amazingly our two year old remained unscathed. After a relaxing hassle free fortnight we'd definitely come again or try another Riu elsewhere. Great time was had by all and we were very sorry to leave.

We were booked at the farthest area back in the resort as possible. The room smelled moldy, was too small with inadequate storage, the blankets were soiled and of course, there was no staff to be found. It was a major hike to get anywhere within the grounds. After much coaxing, we were moved to a different room the next day which was the same size but closer to the public. They provided a \"towel card\" which required you to drag a dirty towel up to the pool each day. Very little of the staff spoke English. The outdoor furniture was not clean, the bars were routinely sticky. The bar personnel behaved as though they were doing you a favor by serving you. The bars were always crowded and teenagers were allowed to sit at the bars, using up adult chairs while drinking non-alcoholic beverages. The bars closed early (10PM at one and 12AM at another). The \"disco\" area was pitch black, smelled terrible and was very small. There were no scheduled activities and the pools were scaly and appeared dirty. On the beach, sales persons for excursions were borderline harassing guests with shouting, interrupting conversations and siestas. The resort allowed peddlers on the beach and we were barraged daily for silver, trinkets and the like.

We had had friends stay at both the Riu Tequila, Yucatan and Palace and all highly recommended the Riu Chain. It says something about the Tequila atmosphere when the friends who were staying at the Palace preferred hanging out at the Tequila. We're beach people when hanging at the resort and the beach was beautiful. Yes there were sand bags, but there is a purpose behind them and I'd rather have the bags now then no beach in the future. And mentioned earlier if one takes a walk to the right, when facing the water, eventually there is all beach and no bags. As for being harassed on the beach by vendors or activity people, maybe we were lucky but once we said we were not interested we were left alone. We hopped in the pool following tennis and for pool people it was very clean and there were loungers available whenever we were there . Tennis courts you book your time, and the courts were always available when we wished to play, and in good shape.

We cannot say enough good things about our tour guide, Tatiana, who led us on Coba Trip, she was amazing. We also chose to visit Tulum on our own, taking the collectivo from Playa down to Tulum, taking our time and then having a lunch at a local restaurant in the town of Tulum before returning to Playa.

The staff was excellent, the food pretty good all around, everyone found something to eat and we ate out twice at the al a carte Steak House which was really nice. This hotel is right in the middle of all the tour sites so travelling to do the zip lines, horse back riding and Akumel took about 40 min at the most. Cancun was about 45 min. away and no problem as we had a ride booked there and back with our trip so we just arrived and got on our bus. We walked into Playa del Carmen once and took cabs the rest of the time for $5. Playa hotel zone is a gated community so we all felt very safe and had no problems with anything. We took a bus to Akumel $2 each but could have taken the collectivo if the bus wasn't running in 10 mintues. Took a cab back from Akumel for $30 as we didn't feel like walking the 4 blocks to the hi way and catching the collectivo. The collectivo's are all marked and run every 10 min, up and down the road and will drop you at any of the sites like Tulum, Xel-Ha and Xcaret. There are a lot of other tours like the croccun farm and swimming in cenotes, You can catch them right in Playa so walk into town and jump on one of them. The beach is a short walk or golf cart ride away and we did both. The kids enjoyed the cart ride. We always found places to sit at the pool or at the beach, as people were always getting up and leaving empty chairs. We also walked way down the beach and enjoyed the jungle at the end of the 3 beach hotels. I also booked the dolphin discovery online and got a $50 discount, I booked the Selvatica zip lines and Lomo Bonito horse ride online and it was nice to know it was paid for before getting there. Saved time trying to figure out what to do once we got there. Watch out for the \"porters\" at the airport, they will grab your luggage and move it about 100 feet and then demand a tip!

We had 3 in one room and just had a cot brought in and it was fine, who stays in the room during a trip anyway?

The guest were mostly families or older people but we were not there to party and our teens were not bored just hanging out with us or doing the tours. The entertainment at night was ok but mostly the same dances just different costumes each night except for the Mayan night was was really neat. the staff worked really hard during the day to get us to play water polo, learn to salsa and tons of other stuff.

Couldn't disagree more with an earlier negative review. It was an exaggeration of minor points to the extreme. We too have been to many carribean islands. The staff at the Riu Tequila could not do enough to help. Check-in was slick and very efficient with staff giving us envelopes with room keys in to avoid long queues at the reception desk after an 11.5 hr journey from airport. There were 2 pools. One had organised activities in it. The other pool was generally very quiet until around 2pm when a small minority of Americans seemed to get very drunk and very loud around the pool bar area and stand in the middle of the pool with their drinks (and that was mainly the women). Beds did get reserved around the pool but there was always lots of beds still available whatever time you got there. These were mainly in the shade but you could always move them to a sunnier spot. Food was plentiful and varied. There was too much salt, sugar and oil used but this is not marketed as a health farm. With regards to temperature, food was hot enough - it was never going to be gourmet food when catering for hundreds of people at one time. You just needed to tackle the longer queues first to avoid other food on your plate going cold. I normally suffer from tummy upsets on holiday but for the first time I didn't get ill once which must say something about the hygeine and cleanliness of the place. With regards to evening entertainment, from 8.30 to 9.30 it was mini disco for the children. The only reason the children were running about between tables is because they were doing the conga under the supervision of the animation team. The rest of the time the children were on the stage enjoying themselves and those that weren't sat with their parents. At 9.30 every night a show was put on. The animation team worked very hard and their dancing was impressive. The reason many people left then is because, like us, they had young children that needed to go to bed. The hotel is not on the beach, but if you do your research this will be no surprise, and indeed the walk was very pleasant. We always got passed by a beach buggy, and it was never full and would stop if you flagged it down. We always found empty beds on the beach when we arrived after lunch, and not once got hassled by beach sellers (I think they avoid families in general). As our room was at the end of the corridor, it was dark at 5.30pm but not too hard to unlock the door. The corridor lights came on around 6.30pm. A positive point about being at the end of the corridor was that it was quiet. We only tried the steakhouse speciality restaurant. It was OK but not great. For some reason, you are asked your nationality when reserving a table. English speaking families are put on one side of the restaurant (and are served last) and non- English are seated the other side and are served first. The non-English are also given a display of pouring lighted alcohol over the souffle dessert. Luckily we incorrectly got seated with the non-English speaking so were served quickly! With regards to queueing, please don't group the English with other Europeans, as we are the most patient and always queue (unless others push in). Our only negative would be the miserable Thomson rep who did the bare minimum to help us when needed and gave out incorrect information when she did help. Also a small box containing my jewellery went missing (although I'm certain I kept it in the safety deposit box). I didn't realise it was missing until on the plane home. Luckily it wasn't expensive. We had good flights outwards and return with no delays and all seats had an activity screen to play games and watch TV. If it didn't work, you got offered free drinks.

I have been to over 2 dozen islands (Bahamas 5 times, Jamaica 7 times, St Martin 7 times, Aruba 3 times, Turks & caicos 1 time, Punta Cana 1 time, St. Lucia, Martinique, all sorts of resorts: Sandals, Beaches, Breezes, Hedonism, etc) and all inclusives and this was the worst that I have ever been to. The hotel itself is very nice in structure, d\u00e9cor, but NOT in service or in FOOD. I was very disappointed. First of all, it is NOT on the beach. It\u2019s not even on the same side of the road as the beach. You literally have to go out the front of the resort, cross the street with traffic and enter this long walkway that brings you to the beach. Not very convenient if you have to go back to your room for anything. Or you can take a golf cart that makes rounds but not between 1 PM and 3 PM. Usually there are more people waiting for the cart that fit and I can say that people were not so gracious as to allow the people that were waiting there first to get on, it was pretty much a RUN for it! The pool was nice. It is actually 2 pools with a building in the middle that housed the lunch buffet and bar. The one side of the building had a swim up bar, the other did not have access at all, so you would get out of the water, put your shoes on and go into the building for a drink. The only complaint I had about the pool is that you have to get up LITERALLY At the crack of dawn if you wanted a seat. I have never been to a place before where you had such competition for a chair! We would be at the pool around 8:30 AM and most of the seats were taken or \u201creserved\u201d which made me even more mad. I saw people \u201creserve\u201d their seats and then go to the beach!! What is that about?? Just in case you want to come back? WORST OFF\u2026we had many many many people from England that would reserve seats in the sun AND in the shade! Then they would lounge in the sun until they got hot or whatever and then move onto their shade chairs. This meant that for each of them, they were reserving 2 chairs! So I am guessing it was NOT the resorts fault that most others that arrived at the pool later than 7 AM did not have a chair to sit in! This was every morning we were there. I call it ridiculous! Sorry. Half the time you would look around the pool and see most chairs never used at ANY part of the day! Those people could not have been in the pool either because there were only a handful of people in the pool at all because the water was so freezing cold. The beach is not much better. After you drive there on the golf cart, if you are lucky to push someone else out of the way to get on it or walk across the street to the pool, then you have to walk up and down searching for chairs. Even 2 together. The thing I hated about the beach, was not the big sand bags in the water, which were not a big deal at all. It was that the chairs are about 7 inches from the very next person, on either side. There is not even anywhere to pull the chairs out of line to move them. I felt literally like people were on top of us. I could not have a discussion with my husband next to me without people on both sides, hearing us, listening, watching. NO PRIVACY what so ever. In Aruba, you could have many seats on the beach grouped together and then several feet at least, in between you and another group of people traveling together. I felt like I was at the Jersey shore here. ON TOP of each other. Then of course, we were there not even 5 minutes when I got asked to buy a bracelet 4 times, I said no or pretended I was sleeping. Then I had the guys asking if I wanted to parasail 100 times, then the guys that wanted me to scuba dive, then back to the bracelet lady. I felt like saying LEAVE ME ALONE I am on vacation and it took me 40 minutes to find this chair! Ha ha. Back to the resort\u2026if you eat at the buffet at night (which is pretty much your only choice unless when you are up at 6 AM reserving your pool chair you can reserve your dinner seats too) because it is FIERCE competition to even get IN for reservations at night so we didn\u2019t bother and ate at the buffet EVERY night\u2026.so here\u2019s the thing\u2026be prepared to sit ON TOP of the same people that you were ON TOP of at the beach. The tables for two or any table for that matter are so close that you can not even WALK between them. They leave about 6 inches in between the \u201ccafeteria style\u201d eating and you can HEAR everything that the people are talking about, for goodness sake, I could hear them CHEW! Then you have to have those that want to WATCH you eat. Look over at what you put on your plate up at the buffet. I wanted to turn my head and say to these people \u201cit\u2019s up there, go get some and stop watching mine\u201d. I wanted to have conversation with my husband, you know in private, not sitting elbow to elbow with some guy from Germany and his wife that watch me chew. I felt my husband and I were communicating in expressions of our faces and tilts of the heads just so no one can eaves drop anymore. You do not get a waiter, or you might if you flag one down. No one seemed to be assigned to us at any given time. My husband would go up and get his food, come back, put it down then go back up for our sodas or juice. You don\u2019t have to worry about doing this and your food getting cold, because it already will be while you are standing in the 20 min or more buffet line holding your plate. We by no means, consider ourselves food snobs or interested in FINE dining but we like good food. There was none there for us. Breakfast had raw bacon every morning, I never took one slice because it looked transparent with fat and undercooked. Runny scrambled eggs, every morning. Oh, but you can have toast, also if you want to wait 15 minutes in line with your bread and your other food gets cold. They had good ice cream, that was about it. The pancakes were gross, the omelette line was seriously the longest of any line you will stand in there, so I didn\u2019t even attempt to stand in it, figuring my husband would be completely done his breakfast before I even sat down, so I skipped that but now I can see why it was so long because there was nothing else that looked edible. I can only put it this way, I felt like I was at fat camp. I did have some salad although the entire time I was there, not once was romaine lettuce offered, just curly purple kind with my Caesar dressing and stale croutons. Oh another thing that I guess would not bother anyone else OTHER than Americans is that there is NO KETCHUP. No Heinz Ketchup offered anywhere, not for eggs, not for French fries, not for your hamburger, NOTHING. They have \u201ccatsup\u201d that is Brown and the consistency of water if you want to try that. I was brave enough to try it once and then decided to stay away from it. I did not expect to pay all that money and be fed cold cuts that looked like they have been sitting out for days and hamburgers that were made with onions in them, with NO cheese even offered to make it a cheeseburger. They had raw looking hot dogs soaking in sourkraut if you like that. Everything looked like things were just recycled of what was left over at dinner. Who serves FRIED CHICKEN legs at breakfast???? Never in my life did I see that. Fried, egg battered cowlyflower. Gross!! The best part about standing in the long line holding your plate anxiously awaiting your turn to see what slop was served that day, was the RUDE Europeans that would just walk up, move in between two people to get what they wanted instead of waiting in line like everyone else. That happened WAY too often. I guess they figured the common curtousy did not apply to them. Who knows. I was extremely disappointed and will never return back to Playa del Carmen and this also turned me off from ever staying at a Riu hotel again. I heard many other people that were from Canada expressing their disapproval for the food also. The resort itself looks like it was built very nice, good d\u00e9cor, but that\u2019s about it. The room was very clean other than the 2 cockroaches that we saw on our last day in our bathroom. Our room was very far away and when you did arrive at your door, I hope that you have good hand coordination with no site and what I mean by this is that the doors are black\u2026you have a regular key, not a key card\u2026there are 2 doors to a hallway, NO LIGHTS GO ON in this little hallway until at least 7 PM when most people are either back in their room already or out of their room eating dinner so it is VERY VERY VERY VERY (can\u2019t emphasize this enough) difficult to SEE your keyhole and put your key in. We felt blind. You could not see anything in front of you, I would have to use one hand to feel all around the door for the hole, keep my finger on it while my other hand had the key and I had to feel whether the teeth of the key went up or down and try to slide it in. This frustrated my husband a great deal everytime we came back to our room. NO LIGHTS! Dark hallway= hard to put your key in. It would take us a good 5 minutes to even get the key in the hole. Which doesn\u2019t sound like very long but it is when there are mosquitos buzzing in your ears that you can\u2019t see and you are swatting away with zero free hands. The resort itself had a lot of lush trees around it. Making a GREAT home for all the stray cats that I guess were using it as their giant litterbox. I have a cat at home but these are wild cats were are talking about. They had chunks of body missing, missing fur in spots, beat up looking, all in heat as well. We saw many of them \u201cgetting down\u201d right on the path to our room. This happened several times a day. You would hear that sound they make while in heat. Gross. We saw several POSSUMS!! Do you believe that. A POSSUM!! I am not mistaking these for the other animal life they have on the resort, I will get to that. These are possums that if you saw them in your back yard you would call animal control because of rabies and they are gross and EAT TRASH. They were right near the part of the buffet that people were eating outside, the one possum was walking inches away from a woman\u2019s feet that didn\u2019t even know it was there. They were on the white colored family also, which I have never seen in PA. Gross rodants. The animals that look like half monkeys and half raccoons are not that bad. They seem friendly although I didn\u2019t want them near me. My husband fed them some roll from dinner that he took with him, people were feeding them all over and then taking pictures. You would see one, throw a piece of roll and then blink and see 30 of them. Seemed harmless. They only really came around as the sun was going down. Not like the all day cats! Then there was the animal that had no tail, looked sort of like a squirrel family? Not sure what they are called, they were all over too but didn\u2019t seem to bother anyone. They were more scared of anyone near them. You can go across the street to other Riu, just not the Palace one. They wont even let you in with the bracelet that we had. Which is strange because one day, we went in with no one saying a thing then the very next day walked back over and was not allowed in. Probably because it was around dinner time and they thought we would eat there. You are not allowed to. In fact, you are not allowed to eat dinner at any other hotel other than your own. Nightlife\u2026there was none. A bar near the show stage, we would hang there, get drinks, wait for the show to start around 9:30 and then leave because the shows were AWFUL. From dinner time until 9:30 when the show starts they filled the stage with the many kids and let them hit a pi\u00f1ata or something. The most of parents that where there the week we were, just let their 8-10 year old boys run around. When I say run around, I mean LITERALLY RUN. Here you have adults, sitting at tables with drinks and the tables were pretty close together and then nightly we would have these boys RUNNING all over in between these tables with NO parental supervision at all. I am a mother of 2 boys and would NEVER let them do that or act this way. Where were these parents??? It was every night! They do have a Sports bar , they call it with a bunch of tvs with pretty much ONLY SOCCER on and then a whole bunch of sports posters around. This housed a bar, the internet computers (which you purchase in increments of 15 minutes) and pool tables, air hockey, all that you need coins for. Then they have a refrigerated case with premade sandwiches and then next to it, a microwave, napkins, etc. I guess in case you are hungry after the buffet closes at 10 PM. The \u201crestaurant\u201d that you make reservations for is pretty much where the swim up bar is during the day for the lunch buffet that they convert into the steak house, there are no more actual restaurants. Another thing to note, I run a business and brought my lap top with me as I always do thinking they would offer wifi to purchase in my room , but the hotel does not have wifi. So don\u2019t bother taking your own computer at all. You have to go the sports bar and sit there and wait for a computer to open up while all the 8 year old boys that were previously running around, were now hogging all the computers to online chat with their friends back home. The computers are just inches away from each other with text book sized privacy walls in between which allow for NO privacy at all. People can stand right over you and read your emails. Not exactly what I had in mind to check in my business and answer business emails. I carried my lap top for no reason at all. I saw a building near the stage that said \u201cDisco\u201d on it but it never once opened while we were there, so I am not sure what the deal with that building is. There was nothing to do at night at all. As soon as the show would start , you could see people getting up from their seats and just going back to their rooms. Thank God I brought a good book or two. The t.v. had mostly all Spanish channels so you could put the closed captioning on and read if you wanted to but my husband was not too keen on that. We did not go there to watch tv, but like I said, after dinner, not much choice. There is a bar in your room. Probably the nicest feature of the hotel, large bottles of Evian water, liquor if you wanted it, sodas in the fridge, stocked every 2 days if you needed it. I was actually surprised they offered that to you. All in all, I would obviously not return nor recommend anyone to the resort. I thought that the other people that left negative reviews might have been nitpicking but I should have listened to them. I think that everyone that raves about the food must be from England or Canada as well. Not sure. Because I was not served ANY food in the 4 days that I was there that I actually ate and enjoyed, NOTHING. Oh, Ok, maybe some torilla chips dry. That\u2019s it. If you eat a steak or mystery meat, then be prepared to chew for the entire time you are seated, IF you can cut it, since we were only given butter knives to cut, so cutting is the first hump to get over, then chewing.

To eliminate confusion, the Tequila, Yucutan and Playacar are essentially attached and similar. You can enjoy it all and its like one big resort. The tequila was further away from the beach, but a short nice walk. However, it had nothing over the Yucutan which was closer to the beach so that would be my first choice out of these hotels. Keep in mind that the 2 Riu Palace hotels which were off limits are more posh if that's what you're looking for - these other RIUs are not posh, just nice and clean, large facilities. The buffet food was the best I've had anywhere and always great anytime. The a la carte restaurants, well, forget about them. for some reason they are not set up for this and show a weak attempt at trying....which is puzzeling since the buffets are much better. go figure. Drinks were any way you'd like them, and best of all....NO LINEUPS! No lines for food or drinks any time, even though it got quite busy. The staff busted their butts for guests and never hinted for tips. This place is just not a tipping resort...which is cool because I've stayed and resorts where its 'no tip, no service.' and I don't mind tipping. This all made the overall value great, to the point where I wonder how they offer what they do at the price. Our room was blah. Nothing special and more 3 starish. The resort is quite nice so we didn't spend time in the rooms. The town of Playa was a nice walk away or a 50 peso cab. Xel Ha is 35 dollars to cab to and so well worth it. Water sports are free except Seados. We used the Catamaran sailboats - you can buy lessons then use it for free. However, any real wind and they close them off when the red flag is up. We used the free kayaks too. The beach is great, and yes, the huge sandbags are crappy. this beach has been rebuilt very nicely over the last few years by pumping sand back out from the ocean. The people here in Mexico do a great jobs for tourists and were hurt by the hurricane. I think they deserve our loyalty since this was before and is becoming again one of the best beaches in the world. Oh, the Riu Lupita is a dive and old. Not sure but I think they bought it from some other company. We went through it and it was no comparison.

This review will go step by step from the airport to the rest of the stay. BEWARE at the airport \u2013 once you are cleared customs and on your way, you will go through a set of double glass doors where the timeshare sharks are ready to bite! We were asked by a young lady where we were going and we said Riu Tequila \u2013 she showed us to \u201cOscar\u201d who would \u201chelp us\u201d. Never having been in this situation, we were led astray and talked into a 90 minute presentation of the new Krystal hotel in Cancun. We were told we would be picked up and returned to the Riu and were also promised 2 tickets to Chichen Itza for $400 pesos which is a huge saving. We paid upfront which was our mistake \u2013 the day that Oscar was to come, he never showed up. My husband waited at the hotel lobby for over 1 hour \u2013 talked to our Sunquest rep and she said this often happens. We chalked it up to a bad experience and vowed we would warn others. The Riu Tequila is AMAZING!! Check-in is a breeze. We booked the resort knowing that it was not on the beach and were very thankful for the walking as we did not gain any weight after all the eating over the 2 weeks. The rooms are a wonderful size and the shower is particularly good. The beds are comfortable \u2013 not as hard as another resort we stayed at. The resort is spotless \u2013 constant work is being done by the maids, groundskeepers and various other staff to ensure that everything is in order. We did leave tips every day for the maid \u2013 20 pesos. The hotel is also in a great location. We could walk to Playa Del Carmen \u2013 3 km and did this often. Food \u2013 my husband is a picky eater and was very happy with all the selection at each meal. We did have lunch a couple of times at the beach restaurant at the Riu Yucatan. Not nearly as good. We also had breakfast one morning there. Did not like it near as much \u2013 very congested food area and not as many choices of food. At the Riu Tequila we went to all 3 a la cartes \u2013 Mexican (not great but you should try it yourself), Asian (wonderful \u2013 even for my husband) and Steakhouse (awesome!). The staff work tirelessly to serve and we noticed we seemed to be the only couple who left tips for the dinner staff each night. We were told by another couple that these waiters make 2000 pesos a month which is roughly 200 Canadian. They work 6 days a week, split shift, 10 hours a day. That works out to 77 cents an hour. Give them a 20 peso tip \u2013 they deserve it! Drinks \u2013 The drinks they serve are the real thing. Bartenders are very accommodating and we especially loved Victor at the bar by Theatre. Entertainment Staff \u2013 They work tirelessly to provide daytime activities and evening entertainment. There is no pressure from them to participate if you don\u2019t want to. We booked a Chichen Itza tour through Best Day Travel. They used a 14 passenger van that you could almost stand up in. The seats were very comfortable and the tour stopped at a store for a rest and shopping, then Chichen Itza, lunch (included), a cenote for swimming \u2013 this was amazing and refreshing, and also stopped at Valladolid, a colonial city. The entire day was about 13 hours which was long but well worth it. Nice to have a small group as it was more intimate. We also booked Xel-ha through a rep at the ADO bus terminal. It, again, was worth every penny. Do not do this as a Tulum/Xel-ha tour as you will not have enough time at Xel-ha. It is huge and there is so much to do. We took the ADO bus into Cancun one day \u2013 primarily to see the Hard Rock Caf\u00e9, then hopped the city bus. We also took the ADO bus to Tulum. It is a cheap mode of transportation with very comfortable, clean seats. Movies are shown but of the 4 we saw, 3 were in Spanish. We also took the ferry to Cozumel (another Hard Rock Caf\u00e9!). Make sure you take Gravol or something as the ride is quite the experience. Many people were sick, thankfully not us. Also beware of the shop keepers \u2013 this was the worst place for them following us around and begging us to buy stuff. The beach, sand and colour of the water is amazing! No problem getting loungers here. Also, at the pool \u2013 if you want a lounger in the sun you must go out early. The Riu Tequila is a resort that caters to everyone\u2019s needs.

We like the location (we don't mind the walk to the beach) and the kids used to enjoy going to the Kid's Club. Unfortunately, we were disappointed to find out that \"someone\" got stolen my ipod from the inside pocket of my backpack; and we didn't notice this until we got to the airport. (they must've known we were checking out and decided to steal it at the last possible minute). It's not like the ipod it's expensive but the thing that upsets me the most is that it took me a couple of years of collecting songs from friends and different places to get so many songs in there that I'll never get again. The ipod was the ONLY thing we didn't think of leaving in the safety box! So be careful not to leave any valuables out. Another dissapointment was the Kid's Club. My kids used to love going there and this would give us a couple of hours of a break so that we could play volleyball. Unfortunately, the guy in charged of the kids this time didn't have enough chemistry with them and seemed like he didn't want to be \"bothered\" by the children. He always showed up a 1/2 hr late to open the kid's club. And then he would have the kids color, or do silly games that the kids found really boring, so they didn't want to go. We were glad that our children made friends with other kids their age so that they had someone to play by the pool. (or at the beach). We stayed in room 1605 which was one of the newer rooms. It is smaller than the Jr Suite we stayed at last time. We had 2 double beds (that they had put together) and a cot. This arrangement left very little room to move around, but we didnt' mind much since we were in the room only to shower and go out again. We spent very little time in our room. I was surprised to see the old kind of tv in the new room as oppossed to having a plasma tv. One thing that we found annoying was the noise around our rooms (especially in the early morning, around 2am-3am when people were returning from partying in town, or around 7-8am when other people were leaving for breakfast). One evening we heard a couple fighting (girl was screaming and crying) but it only lasted for a few minutes. I can see that the food could be a little boring after a few days but we seemed to be able to find something we liked every day. I didn't care much for the desserts - they were too creamy, rich, etc. I would've preferred something sweet but on the lighter side. And yes, I agree with other reviews when they say the entertainment team (Animacion) is excellent! they do as much as they can with whatever little resources/experience they have. You can tell they are amateurs (only one of them is a professional dancer) but they do their best, and because you spend so much of your time playing and interacting with them is sort of like seeing your friends perform on stage. (i.e. you clap and scream \"Bravo!\" the same way you would do to a friend performing, but deep down you know they really suck!!). Yes: take something for the mosquitoes. Our kids really got some biten during the night. (thank god for Caladryl!). And take PLENTY of sunscreen (different SPFs, aloe vera, something for the sunburn, etc) because they charge SO MUCH money for them everywhere in Playa.

We arrived late in the evening but our check-in went smoothly and we were in our room by about 12:45. The snack bar is open 24 hours, so we found our way there for a snack and a couple drinks. Our first impression the following morning was \"Yes, we can spend 2 weeks here easily\" The front lobby is very rich looking and spacious, lots of plants, seating areas, and the reception staff are courteous and most helpful. The grounds are impeccably manicured, gardens are beautifully kept. All staff from the reception to the gardeners are friendly, always offering a smile with their greeting. Our room was a good size with a large closet with lots of hangers!! There is an in-room safe in the closet. The resort has been renovated recently, so everything was fresh. Our housekeeper, Eddy, did an amazing job, always suppling fresh towels, toiletries, etc. We also got a new towel art animal just about everyday!! We did leave him a tip each day (about 20 pecos) and the beverage guys came around each day, late in the afternoon, to see if you wanted any extra beer for your fridge (they fill the fridge with assorted beverages every other day). There is also an in-room liquor dispenser for your convenience with tequila, vodka, rum and gin. The food was wonderful. The main buffet was excellent, both breakfast and dinner. So many choices, from the salad bar to the hot foods. Perhaps not as much seafood as we would have liked, but their roasted and barbecued meats were fabulous. The steak house meal was also very good, our steak being cooked perfectly (melted in our mouths). The light breakfast and lunches at the pool house restaurant were always good, lots of choices. The coffee from the espresso machine was really good. We had it most mornings at the pool house. The ice cream from the machine was so good - really cold and refreshing. We enjoyed our walk to the beach along a shaded path, often spotting a few monkeys on the way. You could also take the shuttle if you so desired. The beach was beautiful, lots of chairs to choose from, either in the sun or under the shade of the palms. The surf was quite rough the first part of our visit, but the most enjoyable walks, in either direction. The \"sand whales\" along the beach offered some protection for the shoreline against the rough surf, but DO NOT walk on these as they are extremely slippery when wet. Several people were hurt on these while we were there. The pool was always spotless inside and out. Lots of chairs to choose from, again in the sun or in the shade. The night air was cool so the water temperature was very refreshing during the day. The lounges in the pool are a lovely way to relax and take in the sunshine, while cooling off at the same time! The entertainment staff were so friendly and entertaining. They have programs running from late morning until about 5pm, if you wish to participate. The service was excellent at the pool bar. Our bartender, Feliciano, would see us coming and have our drinks on the way. Always friendly, laughing, playing around with their patrons (rolling a lime under a knapkin toward unsuspecting people). The mohitos were good and the beer always cold. We do suggest taking insulated mugs for your drinks as it doesn't take them long to warm up!! There is a little shopping plaza just a 5 minute walk from the resort which has everything from souvenirs to jewellery and clothing. We also made our way in to Playa Del Carmen along 5th Avenue. A taxi ride is about 5 minutes, 50 pecos. This was a wonderful vacation away with that someone special. The service and surroundings truly couldn't have been better. We would certainly recommend this resort and wouldn't hesitate going back. We met some really nice people with whom we shared some time together (Kris and Don, and the \"Cracker Kids' family from Richmond Hill). This is an amazing area to vacation in, so much to see and do.

The hotel grounds are wonderful. The rooms are simple but clean. The staff are nice and work hard. The walk to the beach is a blessing after all that food. The buffet becomes a bit repetitive, and they obviously recycle a lot of stuff (cold sausage salad, made with yesterdays' sausages) but that is the norm in all inclusive resorts. Plenty of choice to suit every taste, if anything a bit short on fish for my own liking but if you are a meat person then plenty of beef, pork, chicken, etc. having said that there was fish at every meal (but it was nearly always the same type). Loads of salads and vegetables for the health conscious as well as chips, potatoes, rice, etc., and choice of pizzas and pasta at every meal. As this hotel is a bit away from the beach it means that the during the day is a lot less crowded than the others, as many people go off to the beach. Also you eat a lot better at lunchtime in the pool restaurant than in the beach (less people and more choices). Bad points: the cocktails are made with sirop type liquids, not fresh juice, so they are very sweet (and probably not good for you or your teeth). The wine is awfull for anyone who understands a bit. On the other hand the beer is drinkable (unless you are a beer connosieur). My advice is as follows: 1 - If you hesitate between which Riu to choose in Playa del Carmen, then choose this one (unless you are alergic to walking). 2 - If you like coffee don't bother with the thermos they offer you for breakfast, but find the expresso machine in the buffet area which makes excellent coffee. 3 - Try at least once the oriental restaurant. 4 - At mealtimes drink the red wine (ros\u00e9 & white are far too sweet). If the wine is not cold try and add an ice and it will be more drinkable. 5 - In the bars stick to european brands (martini, porto, etc). 6 - Don't go to Xel-Ha as it is very expensive. Do instead the simple snorkling trip you can book in the hotel booth by the pool. You will save a fortune and we have enjoyed it just as much. 7- But if you do go to Xel-Ha don't bother doing the descent in the river if you have young kids as it is very very hard (you go down but the current pushes you upwards) otherwise you'll spend 2 hours struggling against the current helping the kids and you'll be tired for the rest of the day (an them too). 8 - Take loads of high factor water resistant suncream: The 4 of us went through nearly 3 tubes and still managed to burn. 9 - Take some deet based mosquito repellent and you'll be fine (4 of us had 5 mosquito bites in total) The flight (with Thomson) was OK although you should take your own drinks or be prepared to pay (even for water).

This was a fairly last-minute holiday as we just walked into the travel agents to see what was on offer. There was a Caribbean cruise and the Tequila - so Mexico it was and we are so glad we did. It was great. We flew with Thomson and the flight was fine if a bit long due to bad weather over the Atlantic. I would recommend taking some extra food and snacks on board as the in-flight meal left a bit to be desired. We were starving when we got there! By the time we cleared immigration and travelled to the hotel, it was 6pm and in time to wash, change and get dinner. The check-in procedure is very well planned and the quickest we have encountered. Everything is in a large envelope on a table at the entrance. You just give your name and everything is explained. In the envelope are 2 stickers with your room number to put on your cases. These are then delivered to your room within 20 minutes. Brilliant! First impressions were good. Large, airy and lively reception area with bars, buffet restaurant and entertainment stage leading off. As it was now dark, it was a bit tricky finding our room but we managed ok as it is well signed with a map on the other side of reception. We were located in block 26. This is on the left side of the complex opposite the children's play area and the pool and was lovely and peaceful. Our room faced onto the golf course. The room was lovely with beautiful dark wood furniture and two double beds pushed together. There is a large tv, 2 chairs, table and an iron and ironing board in the wardrobe. There is a huge wardrobe with loads of hanging space and a shelf above. There is plenty of storage and drawers for everything. In the bathroom there are lots of toiletries (which are topped up daily), face cloths, hand towels and bath towels. However, for the ladies who like to wrap their hair in a towel after washing then I suggest you take one with you because there isn't one the right size. The mini bar contains Tequila, Vodka, Gin and Rum and in the fridge there is water, Pepsi, 7up, orangeade, tonic, club soda and Corona beer. These are topped up every 2 days. RESTAURANTS The main buffet restaurant is a vast cavernous room packed with tables set very close together. It gets very busy and sometimes the staff had trouble finding us a table and if they did, it hadn't been cleared yet. This wasn't a big issue but we soon learnt to ask for a table outside on the patio area. As the restaurant is so large, its also very noisy. The queues for the popular hot buffet sections were sometimes very long but there was always something else to have if we didnt want to queue. There is lots to chose from and the salad bar is excellent. Desserts were more limited but ample and there was always fresh fruit and ice-cream and a cheese board. My only grumble would be that fish and seafood was in very limited supply. We ate out in PDC a couple of times to get some seafood! Breakfast is excellent. So much to chose from and they cater for every possible taste. Breakfast ends at 10.30 but over at the pool bar, snacks begin with a small selection of fruit, cereal, ham, cheese and bread for those who have overslept. Lunch is served here all afternoon. Lunch was a little repetative with the same offerings on a regular basis, but as most guests are at the beach and eating at the Yucatan, it is a smaller set-up here. However, we found it pretty similar at the Yucatan and possibly slightly improved at the Playacar - more people therefore more choice. The pool bar becomes the Steak House at night. All the a la cartes have to be booked in the morning on the day you want to eat. You cant book up for the whole week. This was our favourite as it is totally waiter service and no buffet. It feels like you are eating out and not part of a cattle market pushing and shoving in a queue. It is a 5-course set meal consisting of Caesar Salad; Sharing Platter; Soup (delicious); either Sirloin or Rib-eye Steak, BBQ Ribs, 1/2 Spit Roast Chicken or Surf & Turf Kebab; Meringue Cake (which they cover in alcohol and light). Very good. The Asian restaurant was OK. The tables are placed very close together and you feel a little squashed up. This is self-service with a lovely hot and cold starter section with sushi and chinese snacks. The mains are also self service with a large selection to chose from however I would recommend opting for the 7pm sitting rather that the 9pm one. At 7pm you will know that it is all freshly cooked and just put on display. At 9 it wasn't as warm or tasty and it could've been there for two hours already. The fried ice-cream dessert is worth a try though! The Mexican is located at the beach restaurant over at the Yucatan. This was also nice and we only tried it once but it wasn't the kind of Mexican food we were expecting. This is modern contemporary Mexican food not burritos, fajitas and chilli con carne. It was very tasty but we preferred to use the steak house. BARS There are five bars to chose from but they are all open at different times. Two are located off the lobby area by the entertainment stage. The Sports Bar (also just off the stage area), La Pinata disco (also near the stage) and the pool bar (swim-up bar here too of course!). The pool bar is nice for quiet pre-dinner drinks and if you want to get away from the entertainment. This is open from 10.30am - 11pm. The staff here are lovely especially Cruz who is beautiful and friendly. The main bar is open 10.30am - midnight; 'Cocktail' bar (as I called it) 5 - midnight; disco 11pm - 2am and the Sports bar is open 24 hours. Plenty to choose from. Located in the Sports Bar are games tables, lots of tv screens, computers and snacks. Fridges are filled daily with burgers in buns, hotdogs, sandwiches, fruits, popcorn and nachos. There are microwaves to heat up the burgers and hotdogs too. ENTERTAINMENT The entertainment team are the hardest working crew I have encountered on any of our AI holidays. They work from morning to night (literally) keeping the games and fun going all day to producing some of the best shows we have seen. These are properly trained dancers with excellently produced shows and dances. Great imagination and choreography, good choice of music and superb dancing. Every night for 2 weeks it was a different show. One night it was Karaoke night, 'Special Couple' night and a beauty contest another night, so a wide variety to suit different people. POOL The pool is lovely and separated into two different sections either side of the bar/restaurant. One side is quieter and more relaxed, the other has music and games etc. so you can choose what you want. People do get up early and put their towels on the sunbeds but you can usually find a bed somewhere. However, when we were there the water was freezing and we only went in the once. I was gutted as it looked so lovely and I had wanted a pool with a swim-up bar. I'm sure it must get warmer as the weather gets hotter. BEACH The beach is accessed along a path across the road and a shuttle runs all day to save your legs. Its only 5 mins to walk there. It is a very busy beach with lots and lots of sunloungers but no palapas or umbrellas. There are some trees if you want some shade but otherwise you are in the full force of the sun. The 'whales' are a bit of an eye-sore but they are there for a reason. However, they can create bigger waves and it is very dangerous to swim past them. You wont get pestered by anyone trying to sell you anything just occasional guys trying to get you up parasailing. There is no bar service so you will have to keep going to the bar so an insulated mug is a good idea. The downside to the beach is the constant noise of jet-skis and light aircraft flying overhead trailing advertising for bars and clubs in PDC. Further along the past the hotels is unspoilt beach and this is a nice walk away from the crowds. There are no 'whales' here either. TRIPS We never used our Thomson rep as the trips were too expensive. At the shopping plaza there are tour operators who offer the same trips (and a lot more) for less money. We used them and the service was excellent as were the trips. For example Chichen Itza with Thomson $99; Local operator $55. If they give you a price list they will put their name at the bottom. Be sure to ask for that person when you book as they work on a commission basis. They will help you and have more local knowledge than the rep will ever have. SHOPPING There is a shopping plaza 5 minute walk away with a large selection of shops and stalls. Mostly selling tourist stuff, its close by and handy. Located here is a Santander bank and cash machines. You will get a better exchange rate here than at the hotel. PLAYA DEL CARMEN The town is a 30-40 minute walk and is perfectly safe during the day. If you prefer to take a taxi it is only 50 pesos each way and takes 5 mins. The main street 5th Avenue is rammed with bars, restaurants and shops. Everything you could want is here. It is lively, colourful and fascinating. There is an excellent bar/restaurant on the beach called 'Fusion'. The food is excellent and reasonably priced and they have live music in the afternoons and the evenings. We sat under the stars listening to chilled reggae music and was then entertained by bongo drummers and fire dancers! Fantastic. PDC is so accessible and makes a change from being at the hotel all the time. FLIGHT HOME The transfer to the airport was easy and the rep guided us straight to our check-in desk. You need to be ready with your departure tax - they collect this at a small desk in the zig-zag of tape leading to the check-in. They take pesos, dollars or UK pounds. We were then checked-in with great speed and on our way. Very efficient. Cancun airport has lots of shops, food outlets and a couple of bars for last minute spending so don't worry if you haven't got all your souvenirs. The flight home was better and the in-flight meal much improved. It is worth up-grading the flight entertainment as the movies are not very good and the TV programmes were the same as outbound and on a long flight it can get boring. Overall this holiday destination was great. I wouldn't hesitate in recommending it and I would certainly go again. There is so much to see and do and you should never be bored.

We were there for a week, Feb. 6-13, 2009. Overall it was just great. I hate overly negative reviews, so I will get my complaints out of the way first and keep in mind they may not apply to everyone. 1. Mosquito's were a HUGE HUGE problem. They seemed to congregate outside our door and then each day when the maid would clean the room she would prop the door open allowing in thousands more. UGH. I am currently covered in mosquito bites. So take bug spray. Especially if mosquito's tend to really like you, I have hundreds of bites and my husband didn't get one single bite. 2. The coffee... don't drink it, it's like motor oil. And the cream tastes very sour milk. ugh. Stick to tea is my advice. 3. The soap they give you, is very strange, it doesn't seem to lather. My advice, take your own soap. Those are my only complaints. On to the good stuff... We got there on a Friday night, and check in was a breeze, we got a drink and found our room right away. The grounds are amazing, and it is obvious that they have taken much care in the maintenance of it. The room was very large, and very very clean, I never noticed a moldy smell. The patio we had was also very nice. The bathroom was nice as well. And ample room in the closet, I was impressed we had enough hangers to hang up all our clothes. Also, each room has an umbrella, in case of rain. It was clear to me that the housekeeper was doing a great job. We got a towel animal each day. I was very impressed at how clean it was and how hard they worked to maintain it. The food, was good. My husband and I for some reason, both ended up a little sick, but we don't know why, but again, we both feel it was the fact that there was something in the food that set us both off. The days we were not feeling sick, the food was great, we really enjoyed the steak, and the Mexican offerings. The pasta bar was excellent. The breakfast was good also, we really enjoyed the eggs, cooked any way you liked. The snack bar by the pool was also very good. The hamburgers were excellent. The drinks were good as well, this was our second visit to the Mayan Rivera and the drinks at the Riu Tequia were so much better than the place we stayed at a couple of years ago. Even the red wine we really enjoyed. The margaritas were excellent. The Steak House we also really enjoyed, that one was well worth it. The waiters did such a good job. The baked Alaska dessert was impressive. The beach snack bar was also good. They had pretty much the same offerings at each snack bar. We went on this trip to relax and get away. The Riu Tequila fulfilled that. The beach was awesome, the large sand bags they have out to prevent the erosion you don't notice after the first glance. The water was great, it was like a bathtub. We only left the resort one day to go on a trip to Xel-Ha, which was great, very relaxing day trip. Also the shops down the road from the Riu Tequila were nice, it eliminated the need to go to Playa Del Carmen to buy souvenirs for the kids. Everyone was very nice there, there were people there from all over the world, which was very nice to see. The evening shows were good, the first night, was good, it was probably not something I would want my kids to take in though. The Michael Jackson show was good, but we didn't stay for the entire thing. We saw the Grease show, and that was a lot of fun. One night we went over to the Riu Yucatan and watched the Perfect Couple show, that was also a lot of fun, and lots of laughs. All in all (despite the mosquito's, bad coffee, and soap) it was a great holiday and good time away. I would go back, but armed with bug spray and good soap! And don't forget the Imodium!

We wished we stayed at the Tequila. Although it was a 5-8 min. walk to the beach, the walk was through a very nice path and we got to \"walk off\" those extra meals & drinks. The Tequila is very clean, wait staff was great, room staff was great too except they don't speak much english. Be sure to ask for a pillow top for your mattress as the beds are very hard without them. When we transferred to the Playacar, the only upgrade was the fact that it was closer to the beach. The Playacar was smaller, not as many people but we didn't like our room as well. It was smaller and smelled musty. The pool chairs and beach chairs are hard to come by if you wait too late in the morning to get one. We should have stayed at the Tequila and not taken the upgrade. We took an excursion to Cancun on the Captain Hook pirate ship dinner cruise. It was the most memorable trip and one we would do again. Although a little pricy ($80 per person) it was worth every dollar. The entertainment, food and overall experience was above what we expected. Although the food is included in your hotel stay, this was one experience we were glad to spend the money on. They Mayan Adventure was another great trip by van. Three stops to snorkel with a group of only 12 along with our tour guide. It included lunch. Again, worth the money spent on that too.

This is not a 4 or 5 star hotel, but an excellent 3 star. The room had everything you need - hairdrier, tv, electronic safe, even an iron and iron board! The wildlife is something to remember, with lots of racoon like animals, guinea pig like and kittens running around :) Throw a spare banana out your window and you'll see them all crowd round. Mosquito's: Hardly saw any during our stay, only time we got bitten was when we ventured into Playa del carmen in the evening. Food was ok and varied, catering mainly to an american diet with lots of pizzas and pastas. Always a waiter nearby to top up your drink. As buffets go this wasn't too bad, was always plentiful, clean and hot. There's also the steak house, which you need to book in advance if you feel like a slightly more private and exclusive venue. Entertainment is provided each night, and repeated and a weekly basis. All a bit of fun, with the actors giving their all, perhaps helped by the free bar opposite, which has full strength, non-watered down branded alcohol! Perhaps one of the best thing about this hotel was the fact you could wander into the sister hotel at the beach side, only a 5 minute walk, or buggy ride away. This gives you the choice between a beach side bar and restaurant and pool, or a quieter more private pool area at the tequila. A few people have mentioned the \"whales\" on the beach. In truth this is a bit off putting and detracts from a perfect scene however you soon get over this! If you walk further down the beach to the right these soon disappear. If it is perfection you are looking for, get a taxi to Playa Paraiso - an unspoiled stretch of sand with hardly any shops, bars and no hotels or beds, just endless perfect beach. Playa del carmen is either a $5 ride away, or at most a 25 minute walk. We highly recommend La Parilla restaurant on 5th avenue, or if you ventue a bit further the weird and wonderful alux (pronounced aloosh) underground in a limestone cave. El sarape is a wonderful local grill, without any tourists and serves up extremely cheap tasty food. For the best prices on excursions dont go through any of the tour operators in the hotel, head left outside the entrance and walk down to the 2nd hut (Greyline). These guys were great, very friendly, helpful and not at all intrusive like many operators. Tours to Tulum, Coba and Chichen Itza not to be missed, would also recommend a night out to cancun to see coco bongo, not much else there unless you are into shopping!

From the accomodations, food, hotel facilities to the staff, tip-top. Accomodations: We were in block 34 (farthest away) and were a bit disappointed at first as we arrived at night and could not get our bearings in the dark. The next day we tried to move with not much luck, as the hotel was full. We were a little concerned at being so remote as we were 2 gjirls alone. It is a bit dimly lit & perhaps needs a few more spotlights in that area but we felt very secure in the complex, and the extra 5 minute walk helped to burn off the extra calories from the breakfast buffet. The beds were perfectly fine (not too hard) and everything functioned properly in our room. The maids always made original towel art for us & were very effecient & the room was always clean & tidy. Food: The food was awesome. I have no complaints of any of the food facilities. Loved the ice cream machine at the lunch buffet. Enjoyed the breakfast, lunch & dinner buffet (especially bbq night!). We ate twice at the asian ala carte & enjoyed it greatly. Good quality of food & variety. The steak house was okay, nothing to rave about, but it was nice to be served for a change. Beach & Pool: Pools were cool...not used to that. Even the hot tub?? The Tequila pool was quieter with lots of families & kids. The pool bar was quiet. It could have used some music & it would have been livelier. The Yucatan pool was a bee hive of activities & more crowded as it's closer to the beach. The pool bars (both) were packed & there was all kinds of events in the main area throughout the day. Music playing all day. So if your looking for some quiet lounging then I'd suggest staying at the Tequila pool. I was a bit disappointed with the beach, because of the storm damage it's beauty was marred by those giant sandbags & the shoreline is jagged & hilly. (not great for walking or jogging) The beach loungers were uncomfortable & I found the beach just way too packed for my liking. I felt like an ant in a giant ant farm....surrounded by thousands of other ants! Staff: Always friendly & accomodating. Always ready to attend to your every need. Even the entertainment staff.....hats off.....they work day & night to keep everyone happy! :-) Whatever we requested from our maid we promptly got. Front desk was also very helpful & friendly. Guests: The Tequila was filled with Euros from Holland, Germany, Austria, Italy, France & England. About a third of the hotel were Canadians and a light sprinkling of Americans to top it off. It was an interesting mix to say the least. The Yucatan was filled with South Americans (probably from Brazil & Argentina) Overall: I'd recommend this hotel for a fun filled all-you-can-want vacation.......sun, beach, nature, quiet, activities, entertainment, and a variety of other guests from all over the globe. Highly recommend this hotel and would definitely go back. I thoroughly enjoyed everything about the Tequila, I would also consider staying at the Yucatan or Playacar.

Not great. Not bad. There were some things that we liked a lot and others we didn't. The rooms are small and we had two young children so it was a little cramped. but they upgraded us to a Jr. Suite which reflected the highly accomodating nature of the staff. The suite was much better, although it was a long walk from the lobby and beach. The food was not so great in my estimation. We were in Mexico and we had to search for a tortilla? No tacos, burritos or fajitas in sight. Lots of fried food or very bland salad fixings. It was also crowded so you spent a lot of time fighting with others for spots in line at buffet or to make dinner reservations. The beach was very nice, but again crowded. The other guests were mainly European and Canadian which posed some cultural issues in terms of language and politeness honestly with some people. For instance, we had several occasions when the other guests simply muscled our 6 and 4 year old out of the way to get something they wanted in the restaurant, at the pool and at the beach. The kids had a GREAT time at the nightly performances and so did we. The bottom line is that if you are looking for a 4 star experience and are used to a Westin or a top Sheraton, this is not it.

I use a wheelchair, and apart from one easily negotiated ramp to enter the hotel everywhere else is flat. The hotel is large with apartment blocks set in lovely gardens but don't be put off as you can whizz along all the wide paths with no trouble - I stayed in the block furthest away from reception, dining room, theatre and was pleased to have such a great room in a peaceful spot. This was a standard room but I had no problems using the shower (always hot and powerful) as it had a handrail, but there are some specially adapted rooms if required.The room was always spotlessly clean, and towels and bed linen were changed very regularly and all the drinks in the fridge were a real bonus, and the optics were a nice touch but we did not use them. The pools were cool, as you would expect in Jan, but it was easy to get in and out, with steps, slopes, and rails strategically placed so again a boon for disabled guests, and it was great to sit at the pool bar and chill out with a cocktail.All the bars were good but the Sports Bar was our favourite - Ricardo was a brilliant barman. My husband was pleased that 'proper' brands of spirits such as Smirnoff vodka and Ballantines whisky were always available at whichever bar we went to. There were a huge number of staff and everyone seemed to take pride in doing their job well. The atmosphere in the hotel was always so cheerful and positive, every area was clean and comfortable, and the entertainment staff encouraged you to get involved in the vast range of activities but were never intrusive. We always sat on the terrace for our breakfast and dinner, as there was more space for my wheelchair, and who wants to eat inside when it's warm anyway? Uriel, a fantastic waiter, started to save us a table and looked after us brilliantly and even decorated our table with flowers on the final evening. Although the food was not cordon bleu standard, there was an enormous choice and we always found something delicious to eat, with lots of things cooked as you waited - couldn't be fresher! Try the omlettes at breakfast - yum yum! Only food we were disappointed with was the Steakhouse, don't bother with this, steak in the main restaurant is better, but DO try the Asian restaurant, food and atmosphere are lovely, we went twice (booking after breakfast, not at 7.00am as some people have suggested) We used the Yucatan and the Playacar, it was great to have a trio of hotels to use but were glad we were based at the Tequila as we thought it was the best of the three.The beach is great and I was able to access the sunbeds with little difficulty with my husband's help, and even swam in the sea (very warm) on a couple of occasions although I did need alot of help to get out as there is a slope - but can be done. We had a car for 2 days, Akumal and Puerto Aventura to the south and Puerto Morelos to the north are good destinations. After advice we decided not to visit the historic sites as they are very difficult to access in a chair. We also went on the ferry to Cozumel, and no matter how bad the weather the ferry crew will get you on and off the boat no matter how disabled you are.

Great service, hotel, etc. Rooms Stayed in Building 34 - pretty much at the back of the resort. At first was a little disapointed to be of the beaten path, but was well worth it as there was little to no noise at night. Beds are extremely hard. Ask for mattress toppers which add some relief. Pretty much a basic room. No complaints. Food Buffett was really good. Great selection to satisfy everyone. Each night was a different theme and a food to go with it. ie BBQ night with steak, chicken ribs, etc. This was my favorite. Then the other main courses were Turkey, Pork. Any of the chicken was really good. Steak House - just OK. Cut of meat not the greatest Mexican - very good Oriental - very good - fried ice cream was a let down Beach Yes it is about a 10 minute walk, but as you are walking and chatting it goes by fast. Actually, we did not see the trolley once, but I think it was because we went early and left late. Ocean was warmer than the pools. No rocks, nice and sandy. Pools Chilly but once you were in them for a few minutes it wasn't so bad Spa Had 3 great massages while on vacation. Get the double delight which allows you to choose 2 specialty items for $150. Ask for Carlos, he was wonderful. Service Overall great service. On day 5 we were upgraded to the Riu Playacar. We were excited to be closer to the ocean, but after the first night we all agreed that we wished we had not moved. The building that you rooms are in are VERY loud. No chance of an afternoon nap. Rooms smelled really mustly and were a little bit run down. This hotel seemed to carter more to the American's which was great since we had not run into any other American's at the Tequila.

We were at the Riu Tequila for four nights and were very pleased with it overall. Room: The rooms were great - newly renovated. It had two full size beds pushed together and a little alcove area where the closet, sink, bathrooms were. Some reviews said beds were hard but we thought they were just fine. Food: The main restaurant is buffet style - food there is pretty good. Many other sites/reviews said the dress code is pants for men but when we were there - no one really followed the dress code. The only complaint we had was regarding making reservation for the specialty restaurants. They say go to the main dining room in the morning between 7:30am to 10:30am to make reservation - but if you don't get there before 8ish - there's nothing left. So that's a bit frustrating. However, with that said - we were disappointed at the Asian specialty restaurant \"Bamboo\". Food there was subpar and definitely not authentic. Location: The location of Riu Tequila is great - it's in the resort community of Playa Del Carmen/Playacar. As others have said - it's a quick 10 min walk to the beach across the street; $5 taxi ride into town, and 2 min walk to little shopping plaza right next door. Beach in this area is ok - not very deep beach and there are a lot of big sand bags on the beach to prevent further erosion. Activities: The entertainment crew was great. It was rainy/cloudy most of the time we were there - the crew still had planned many activities that people can partake: ping-pong tournaments, beach volleyball, mexican games, blackjack...etc. Some of the evening entertainment were great - especially the dancing ones! Excursions: We booked the \"Mayan Encounter\" tour with AllTourNative through the reps in the lobby. Definitely ask if they can give you discounts - our guy gave us 10% off. The \"AllTourNative\" tour was great: we went to see/climb Coba, did a zipline, then rapel down a little cliff, kayaked a bit and went swimming in a cenote. Overall - it was a nice vacation - just wish it was warmer so we can use the beautiful pools.

We booked our 2 weeks at the Riu Tequila with Thompson so I am judging it against what their brochure described. General Impression: A large, clean and well maintained property with plenty of facilities and good standards of catering and service. Staff all very pleasant and friendly. Rooms: We had a double room in the complex and found it to be in a good state of repair and very comfortable. In room facilities included a very large bed, wardrobe with plenty of hanging space, large double chest of drawers, 2x bedside cabinets, table & 2 chairs, balcony with furniture & drying rack, television (range of sat channels), digital safe, ironing board and iron, umbrella, hair dryer, mini bar re-stocked with mixers, beer and soft drinks every 2 days, drinks dispenser with 4 spirits, ice buckets (which could be filled from nearby ice stations), air con and ceiling fan. We did get a few mosquito bites over night in the room so worth taking a plug in or similar. Soaps and shampoo etc sachets were provided as was plenty of bottled water. Towels replaced in accordance with guests wishes. Grounds: Really nice grounds at this hotel \u2013 meticulously maintained. Great pool with plenty of beds. Some great wildlife to be spotted in the communal areas too \u2013 iguanas and some funny little mammals (agouti and coatimundi) that I have not seen before! Look out for the occasional pelican overhead too! Beach: The beach is just a short pleasant stroll across the road or can be accessed by a regular buggy shuttle for those who really want to take things easy! Plenty of beds on the beach with good choice of sun and shade. There has been plenty said about the sandbags in the sea so I won\u2019t labour it but, in my opinion, they do not spoil the view too much. Some days the sea was quite choppy and other days flat \u2013 guess it depends of weather/winds etc. Eats and Drinks: The standard of food was pretty good at the Tequila. There is everything imaginable in the main Jalisco restaurant for breakfast - catering for British, American and continental tastes as well as Mexican breakfast fare. The restaurant is big and buffet style so can therefore be quite noisy and busy at both breakfast and evening meals. Evening meals again cater for a wide variety of tastes and the food is impressive for this type of board (i.e. buffet style all inc). The lunch at the Lupita (near the pool) is also very good at the Tequila \u2013 much better, we felt, than the beach lunch available through the Riu Yucatan. Of the speciality restaurants, we used both the steakhouse and the Bamboo restaurant twice. Both were very good and did provide a more relaxing experience than the Jalisco. We didn\u2019t try the Mexican at the Yucatan as some people were not too keen and we were not over impressed with their lunchtime catering. The bars were very efficient \u2013 never had to wait long for service and good range of cocktails available as well as beer, wines and soft drinks. Entertainment: I should start off by owning up to not generally being a fan of hotel entertainment \u2013 we tend to be more a \u2018game of cards\u2019 couple then the whole cabaret experience. Therefore I am not the best judge but I can say from what I have seen at other hotels around the world, the Tequila\u2019s team stood head and shoulders above. Some nights were better than others and for me the team were at their best with the dance shows. There are some amazing dancers there and if that\u2019s your bag then I am sure you will enjoy. The kids programmes seemed popular too. Trips: We did a couple of great trips to Chichen Itza and to Tulum/Xel Ha. However, we did not do these with Thomson. Thomson wanted $99 pp (USD) for the Chichen Itza trip yet we paid just $45 pp (USD) with a local agent (Millennium). Thomson warned against going local - saying that they might not turn up and/or would try to sell timeshare. However, we simply went to a fixed agent in Playa Del Carmen (i.e. one with an office rather then just a street tout) and agreed a price for the trip (insisting on no timeshare malarkey) and paid a deposit only, agreeing to pay the rest when they collected us. The trip was great and we were a fairly small party which made the guide experience special and easy to follow. Obviously there is less \u2018come back\u2019 booking trips locally but I felt that the over inflated Thomson prices warranted the risk and for us it definitely paid off. Who is it for: If you are looking for something quiet and cosy, authentically Mexican and a little exclusive then I wouldn\u2019t suggest this is for you. It is a big hotel and it can be quite lively around the pool and bars (not Ibiza rave lively \u2013 but just a bit loud and vibrant). On the upside of that though, the scale of the place means that facilities and choice are abundant. We just wanted a reasonably priced base, with everything at hand for a couple of weeks winter sun and to that end, it lived up to Thomson\u2019s brochure and provided what we expected which we felt was good value for the money paid.", "Date": "January 26, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "midlands england", "Title": "\u201cfantastic hotel\u201d", "Author": "sam\u03c6ll", "ReviewID": "UR23912412", "Content": "we flew out to mexico on the 7th jan 09 we arrived at the hotel to refreshments and given our keys to our room instantly.

We are a couple in our mid 30's, two kids 9 & 5. This was our second trip to this particular resort and third to Playa. We normally do not stay at the same resort, but without a doubt the Riu Tequila is one of the best values out of every destination we have traveled (Cancun, Playa, Belize, Puerto Vallarta, Antigua). I use the word \"value\" in the most complimentary way possible. The grounds are beautiful and spacious, the service top notch, and food very adequate. Christmas eve dinner was special, reservation only restaurants are worth the wait. My only complaint is the beds are very \"firm.\" We tried something this year that I would recommend. We took two queen mattress toppers (\"foam egg cartons\"). They only cost $25 for both. Probably the best money spent on the trip. Since baggage fees are getting out of hand, there is a Wal-Mart that you can wait until you arrive. Just a tip that worked well for us. Usually there are enough reviews talking about the airport timeshare people...listen to the reviews and ignore all of the people that are \"there to help you.\" Unlike other resorts, we have never been approached at the Tequila about timeshares or the like...thank you for letting us relax! Don't be concerned about it being one of the few properties not on the beach. We love the ocean and the beach. The pool is OK, but for our tastes doesn't even compare. The Riu Yucatan and Riu Playacar are great resorts with a pleasant walk (which I need given the quantity of food consumed during our stay). We really like the Riu Playacar, but considering the usual savings of the Tequila (over $1000 US for us) we are more than happy to stay across the street. Besides, at night the grounds of the Tequila surpass the others. It is easy to read reviews complaining about the house keeping, but I will brag on the Tequila's. I accidentally left a second wallet out on the counter in plain sight. It had about $40 dollars in it. When we came back it was right were it was when we left. As a matter of fact, the first day I left a couple of dollars for a tip, and they didn't take it. The next day I left it on the pillow and they realized it was for them. The resort is a great location along the hotel strip. Cab rides are cheap ($5 US one way to the 5th Ave.). For the first time I recommend actually exchanging foreign currency. With currency markets fluctuating so much from US, EUR, GB Pounds and others, there seems to be a growing desire for the locals to deal in local currency (peso). The hotel offers a competitive rate in a safe environment. The 5th Ave. is fun shopping, especially early evening. A quick ferry ride also departs going over to Cozumel a great and cheap day trip. Expect a multicultural experience. Spain, Canada, England, Italian, American and many other cultures stay at this resort. This aspect is one that appeals to us. We appreciate the diversification. I hope this helps. Good luck in finding the right destination and resort. Let me end by saying there is a reason why the Riu's continually rate so highly.

The food was very good, plentiful and lots of choice, with the option of booking into 3 other restaurants besides the main all you can eat option. Did not think much of the evening shows, although we went, as they were convenient and all the drink is included in the cost. We got a good deal, this is probably cheaper than the hotels on the beach if you don't mind the walk. My kids loved it - the pools were nice (although not heated) and plenty for kids to do - ping pong, volleyball, playground for little ones. The beach was a bit crowded but we always found sunbeds available, either near the pool or on the beach. Hammocks are available also on the beach.

It's a good 25 minute walk into Playa del Carmen which is quite a nice walk if you fancy some exercise and to have a nose at the other hotels etc. Rooms The rooms have recently been renovated. The shower was fantastic, best one for pressure and constant hot water I have encountered at resorts. The beds were very hard but I like that so no problem at all. We were on the ground floor which I felt had a slightly damp smell at certain times \u2013 but it is tropical so you put up with it. The towels did struggle to get dry but they replaced them every day so again no problem. The optics and mini bar is a good touch \u2013 I suspect that they are not abused but it was nice to have them there. Mozzies We did get eaten alive my mozzies early on and then learnt the trick to keep the air-con on at all times \u2013 even so we did see a lot of people with bites and the resort did not get sprayed which surprised me slightly. Take a really strong repellent and good luck \u2013 I guess they just like some more than others. Bars Were excellent. We tried all of them on various occasions and the service was first class. The range of drinks and the fact they had a menu and offered premium brands sets it apart from a lot of other all inclusive. Try a few from the martini menu! Restaurants The main one is buffet style and I couldn\u2019t fault it. Not one instance of dodgy-tummy which is always a good sign! Plenty of variety and all high standard. I went on a tour of the kitchen one day \u2013 that speaks \u2013 if they are willing to show off the kitchens that must be a good sign. We ate in the Aisan and Steak a few times and again couldn\u2019t fault the quality (except instant mash potato with steak which is just wrong!) The only problem is you have to book early (outside the breakfast restaurant) and if you didn\u2019t book by 7.30 you normally only got the early sitting which is 6.45pm which is too early for some. Activities This is where the Tequila excels. The staff were excellent \u2013 were extremely friendly and even if you didn\u2019t do any of the activities they took time to sit down and learn your name just so they remembered you next time.

The hotel has just been renovated, re-painted, new bed sheets, curtains etc. I'm yet to see the changes but im sure they will be fabulous. The food is ok, ok it is a bit repetative, but you wouldn't go hungry, they have a mexican side which is on every night, the main buffet is different everynight e.g one night its Chinese, the next English etc. For people who stick to what they know, there are always chips, pizza, hotdogs available everynight. The rooms are nice, air con and ceiling fan keep it nice and cool. It is a bit slippy as you get out of the shower so we always put down a small towel on the floor to step onto. Mini bar gets re-filled every other day, optics on the wall also do (if you manage to get through the bottles LOL). The people on reception are very helpful, for example, one day my friend accidently smashed an ashtray, we called down to reception, and within 2 minutes a maid was up to clear up the glass. Also regarding reception staff, one night me and my friends decided to have an early night, at 1AM we heard a bit of noise outside our door, it was young children, the next minute one of them kicked our door, so the next day we went to reception and reported this matter to Joseph( the manager) and he dealt with this matter, as later on that day we seen that the door next to our room had a note on the door, not sure what it said but it was from a manager. The entertainment is good, not the best, but they work so hard on it. The animacion team are fantastic, especially Alberto, Emilio, Jasmin, Tony and Pablo. Amazing people, they really make your holiday. Must do trips are The Pirate Ship, it is absolutely fantastic, the best night out, also good for children as they do a treasure hunt for them, for adults it very much about the alcohol. You get your own waiter for different parts of the ship, if they see you have an empty glass they are straight back with another drink, so you come off more than a little bit sqwiffy. Also, Coco Bongo is a must if you are not with children, i'm really excited as a Coco Bongo has just opened in Playa Del Carmen, and now we wont have to travel for an hour to Cancun to get there. Also, don't do the trip for Coco Bongo with the reps, just ask some of the entertainment team if they are going, a couple of them go a dew times a week so you just have to find the one whos going on the day you would like to go. Also, if you go on the trip with the reps, i think its called Juan Huella Night, you only get to stay in Coco Bongo for a short amount of time. If you're going to do it, do it properly and make a night of it.

One has to wonder if they went to the same Riu Tequila as we visited? The one where the staff were extremely pleasant, helpful and friendly and nothing seemed too much trouble. We were greeted on arrival with a cocktail. The grounds were delightful with a good array of wildlife, the Riu Yucatan hotel over the road was the beachfront hotel with a beautiful beach (where we did not see any rowdy people and it was a joy to watch the children enjoying themselves) it was a lovely flat stroll from the Tequila or for anyone who did not wish to take the stroll there was a courtesy train, indeed that hotel even had it's own wild monkeys in the grounds. It was lovely to be able to use the facilities of both hotels (although we did prefer the Tequila!). The room was excellent with a well stocked mini bar, very clean sheets and towels, we were made to feel special with all the 'animals' they rolled the towels into - and even gave towel rolling lessons to anyone who wanted to take part. The food was excellent with a wide variety of choice and was beautifully presented. The dining room was spacious, nicely decorated and very clean, the waiters were friendly and amusing and the bar staff were something else - like a cabaret on their own! they were charming very friendly, amusing and even spoke to us in English and Spanish so we could learn the lingo! The location was excellent, Playa Del Carmen was not too far to walk and from there we got the ferry to Cosumel. We also went on several day trips while we were there: speedboat safari, swimming with Dolphins, jeep safari and more - all of which we were picked up from and dropped back at the hotel.

The place is spotless and although I agree with another review regarding the hard beds, and we did have a leak around the sink behind the mirror (!) it was still wonderfully clean, with excellent and much needed air con and ceiling fan. Leave a small tip for the maid service and they leave you a wonderful towel sculpture! We did not hang around the pool which did get crowded but spent our time on the beach at the Beach Club - so much to do if, like my husband you like an active holiday - and all free (windsurfing, kayaking, sailing, boogie-boarding and the wonderful volleyball - he tried them all) you cannot ask for more. Check out Oscar with the volleyball - terrific fun. If like me you like to lay down and relax in the sun with the occasional swim - equally wonderful with the beautiful blue ocean and the clean white sand - all within a throw of the cocktail bars swim up or otherwise.

The resort gets very busy, this can make moving around and buffet mealtimes a bit slower than you'd like, but this can be avoided by good planning e.g. dining a bit later. The sun loungers around the resort are not best placed to catch the sun although you can move them a little, and that\u2019s only if you get one! People seem to get up silly early here. There can also be a lot of young kids running around but that\u2019s true of most resorts.... In my opinion if you can find anything else wrong with this resort you're either overly picky, like a majority of the bad reviews I\u2019ve read, or have had an unlucky freak bad experience. Now the good, errr... everything else. The rooms are great; I think they must have recently been refurbished. The bed was two beds pushed together, but not two singles, two doubles! Massive, good sat TV, decor, balcony and wait till you see the minibar, tequila on tap... literally. service was excellent, friendly and competant . The animation team really keep you busy lots of activities to do, i played football everyday, great! the best way to catch the sun is to visit the beach which is about a 5-10 min walk down a lovely purpose built path, only the laziest of people will complain about that, besides theres a little shuttle cart that goes up and down all day. beware the beach does get busy, but you'll always get a lounger. resturants and food were varied and tasty and the bar people can fire out cocktails like real pros. The fact you could use the other rui hotels was useful too, also the nearish 5th avenue was interesting and ok for shopping.

Let me start out by saying we booked transporation through BestDay transportation and they were awesome! Last yr we booked through Olympus tours and had some horror stories so I wasn't expecting much when BestDay showed up. However they went above and beyond for their customers!!! Highly recommend. We arrived to the resort with an early check in request and were promptly greeted with a fruit punch drink. Our room was in building 10 which was conviently located not far from the pool and was away from the noise! 2nd floor in the back. Beautiful view of palm trees from the balcony! However the airconditioning wasn't very cool. It got very muggy in our room. Called 3xs, the last time I think the temp. finally dropped alittle below 65degrees. We dealt with it. There was a ceiling fan that we turned on full blast and if you shut the curtains that seperate the bathroom and bed area it made it alittle cooler. The rooms were very nice. New paint and linens. Comfortable pillows! The pool was amazing. We stayed on the side near the swim up bar. It was more quiet there. The other side had a lot of activities..volleyball, etc. The bartenders were amazing. They really get to know you. By the 2nd day, they would see us coming and already have our drinks lined up!!! How much better could that get?? The international breakfast buffet was amazingly good! HUGE selections to choose from. Omelet station, french toast, waffels, fruit bar, and OMG...there is something about their butter that I LOVED! Could've filled up on rolls and butter our entire stay. Lunch buffet was pretty good too. Pizza, chicken, steak, salad bar, dessert bar, icecream, etc. This is also the Steak restaurant at night (reservations needed). We did eat at the Steak rest once and wasn't impressed at all. Actually left hungry. I loved the International buffet for dinner as well! So many choices. Never tried the new Asian rest (Bamboo). We also made reservations for the Mexican rest located at Yucatan and the service was horrible! They only had 5 choices on the menu and nothing was appealing. We left and went back to the International Buffet! Dislikes: The only things we both agreed that we didn't like was having to make reservations for Dinner if you didn't want to eat at the buffet. They only take reserv between 7am-10:30am. You must be in line by 6:30am if you want to eat at a decent time. Reservations for dinner were 7pm seating or 9pm. Breakfast was from 7am-10:30am, Lunch served from 12-3:30. Then there was a huge gap of time between lunch and dinner hours. Dinner was 6:45/7pm. This was extremely inconvenient if you like to eat early so you can do something at night like go shopping. There were a lot of foreigners at the resort. We found 4 other people that were american the 5 days we stayed here which I thought was very suprising. There was a small shopping cntr 1block away. If you wanted more shopping $5 cab ride to 5th avenue which was an 8mile stretch of shopping cntrs & bars/restaurants. We were never bored here! Helpful hint: if you find something at one of the shops wait to buy it, even if they barter with you and you think its a great deal. Go down a few more stores and I guarentee you you'll find the same thing for a quarter of the price! Our resort overbooked and we were asked if we wanted to upgrade to their best resort across the street to Riu Palace Mexico. We took the upgrade however wished we hadn't! The Palace was beautiful but much smaller. The food wasn't nearly as good and the staff wasn't nearly as friendly. At Tequila everytime you walked past one of the employees you were always greeted w/ \"hola\" and a warm smile! At the Palace we were lucky if we got two \"holas\" or even a smile in the 3days we were there! The only thing we liked at the Palace was the beach.

We have been waiting for the re-vamp which took place this summer to be completed and then we went immediately after. It is wonderful, the hotel looks even more beautiful and the staff are so proud of the work that has been done to improve the hotel. We received the most wonderful welcome back from the staff, who were all genuinely really pleased to see us again, they dubbed us now 'Honorary Mexicans' which was lovely. The rooms were much improved, clean and fresh, with an iron and ironing board, well stocked fridge, hairdryer etc. There is the usual 4 litre optic bottles and an ice machiine outside the apartment - all inclusive, of course. The buffet food was excellent, the waiters attentive. There is a new Asian restaurant, the Bamboo, which just blew us away - we went five nights it was so good. You have to pre-book outside the dining room when going into breakfast and also for the Steak House if you want to go there. Again - all inclusive. We had had a really busy year, so all we wanted was to rest and relax on this holiday - we have done all the trips we wanted to do anyway in previous holidays. We strolled down to the Yucatan every day , there is a shuttle but it's a lovely walk and just relaxed with books and drinks from the bars there. Again, a wonderful welcome back from all the staff. There had been a real problem with erosion at the Yucatan beach previously, but they had put large sand-bars in place which seems to have improved the matter enormously and have had the added benefit of attracting flocks of pelicans, who fly in each morning and fish all around them - it's a wonderful sight. There is a large family of howler monkeys living in the trees at the Yucatan and they were really great to watch and photograph. Evenings we spent at the main bar at the Tequila just because we love to be entertained by the staff, they keep us laughing all night. There are also children's entertainers and great shows on offer every evening. Guests can also use the facilities at the Riu Playacar during the day which is another sister hotel there and very pretty. The grounds of all the hotels are superb. We are already booked for the same time next December and that says it all.

It has just been totally refurbished and has been tastefully redecorated throughout. It is a very busy hotel, with lots of people checking in and out every day. It is large but easy to get round once you get your bearings. You can also walk to Playa del Carmen in about half an hour or you can get a taxi there for 5 US dollars or 50 Mexican pesos. At the Tequila there are lots of Americans, Canadians and surprisingly, as no one has mentioned them before, large groups of Eastern Europeans, with Germans and British being in the minority. Noise can be a problem with so many people using the swimming pools and beach areas. We booked the Tequila on a last minute deal with Thomson and paid just over \u00a3700 each for 14 nights. We stayed there from 10th \u2013 24th December 2008 and whilst this hotel has many positive points, there are some negatives, which could be overcome if you put yourself out a little. ROOM BLOCKS The 664 large rooms are in blocks on ground and first floor level and face either inwards, towards the swimming pools, paths etc. or the outwards (and quieter), mainly towards the golf course hidden by tropical gardens and trees. When you check in, you are given a map of the hotel, showing the block numbers. If you\u2019re not happy with where your room is, ask to change it straight away. Noise levels also depend on where your room is. Blocks 30 and 31 are the closest to the La Pinata disco, which doesn\u2019t shut until 2am, block 3 is very close to the road and blocks 32, 33, 34 and 35 are close to the car park of the Playacar Shopping Plaza. We were given room 3315, upstairs facing outwards towards an attractive tropical garden but after several nights and early mornings of car and bank alarms waking us up, we asked to be moved to a quieter area. The reception staff were extremely helpful and we moved to room 2112 in block 21. This is a ground floor room in a very quiet area right at the back of the Tequila, facing outwards towards the golf course/jungle and we saw lots of wildlife here on a daily basis, including parrots, a large group of ring-tailed coatis, (cute long-nosed raccoon-type animals who came right up to our balcony for fruit, especially bananas), large brown guinea pig type rodents called agoutis and a few iguanas. Block 21 is built round an attractive tropical courtyard and is also where the suites are. FOOD The excellent buffet breakfast is served in the huge Jalisco dining room opposite reception from 7 \u2013 10.30am and if you want to book a specialized meal at the Bamboo Asian restaurant, the Steak House situated between the 2 Tequila pools or the Mexican at the beachfront of the Yucatan, you can book these from 7am at the entrance to the Jalisco when you go into breakfast. We never had a problem booking them for the early 7pm sitting, even though the hotel was full. They made a change from the buffet dinner, which didn\u2019t vary much in the 2 weeks we were there, except for the occasional evening BBQ. The Bamboo Asian restaurant was our favourite. Lunch can be eaten at the Tequila, the Playacar or the Yucatan. All served similar food, but the Tequila \u2018Lupita\u2019 has much more variety. The best lunchtime food is served at the Caribbean BBQ party, which is held at all 3 hotels on different lunchtimes. DRINKS We liked the fact that you could help yourself drinks (various coffees, 10 varieties of soft drinks including diet Pepsi, chilled water, beer, and white (horrible) and red wine) all day at the lunch time venues if you didn\u2019t want to queue at the bars, but this system was also open to abuse. SPORTS BAR We found the 24 hour Sports Bar to be a late afternoon retreat and Ricardo the barman was very friendly. It was never busy at this time, maybe because it is a no smoking area. There are 2 huge fridges here and they are stocked with sandwiches, hot dogs, burgers, pizzas which you can heat up in the microwave and lots of fresh fruit which the coatis also enjoyed. The internet in the Sports Bar costs 3 US dollars for 15 minutes but it is much cheaper to walk 5 minutes to the Playacar Plaza and use the excellent internet there for 15 pesos for 15 minutes. BEACH The red flag was flying on the beach for much of our holiday. Residents of the Tequila can use the beach at the Riu Playacar, the Riu Yucatan and the green sun beds in front of the Riu Palace Mexico. The sand is fine and the sea is crystal clear turquoise blue, however, the huge black sandbags placed in the sea to prevent further erosion are slimy and ugly. When we were there, the beach at the Yucatan was crammed with green sun beds right down to the water and it looked more like Benidorm than a tropical beach. In fact, the beaches in front of all the hotels to the right of the Yucatan were similarly jam-packed. We found the beach at the Riu Playacar less crowded and much nicer and to get away from the crowds you can also turn right at the Yucatan beach and walk down past the last hotel \u2013 the Sandos, to a mostly deserted beach where there is less erosion. CANCUN We asked at reception if we could eat at a Riu hotel in Cancun and the manager gave us a lunch/drinks voucher for the luxury Riu Cancun Hotel. We got a taxi to the ADO bus station in Playa del Carmen for 50 pesos, caught the ADO bus to the Cancun bus station for 36 pesos each (just over 1 hour), then the Route 1 public bus to the Hotel Zones for 6 pesos each to the Riu Cancun, reversing the journey back and the whole day cost us 268 pesos (about \u00a315). The receptionist told us if we\u2019d have taken our towel cards, we could have used the beach facilities of the Riu Cancun. Instead, after lunch, we had a look around the totally commercialised Cancun and it was nice to get back to the tropical gardens of the Tequila. TULUM RUINS Our next trip was to the Tulum ruins. We got a taxi to the collectivo stand in Playa del Carmen for 50 pesos, then the collectivo to Tulum (under 1hour) for 35 pesos each. There is a short walk to the ruins or you can catch a \u2018fun train\u2019. Entrance to the ruins is 48 pesos each. You can either buy a book or get a guide or print off some information before you go and read the comprehensive information boards. We saw lots of iguanas here. After visiting the ruins, we walked back up the road to the highway and caught a waiting collectivo, which dropped us off in Playa del Carmen and we got a taxi back to the Tequila. This trip cost us 336 pesos (about \u00a319). AKUMAL BAY and YAL-KU We were able to snorkel in Akumal Bay and Yal-Ku (between Playacar and Tulum), when the red flag was flying in Playacar and spent 3 days there. Snorkelling with Green Sea Turtles was amazing. We caught the collectivo (25 pesos each return) to Akumal Beach from Playa del Carmen. ENTERTAINMENT We watched the entertainment at the Tequila for one night and weren\u2019t very impressed, and then we walked to the Riu Yucatan. We found the Yucatan animation team to be much more professional and really enjoyed their shows because of the sheer effort they put into them. TO SUM UP The Hotel Tequila is a busy hotel but if you get the right room you can escape some of the hustle and bustle. When we first arrived, we thought we\u2019d made a mistake choosing this hotel because the Tequila is so lively, but the hotel staff bend over backwards to help you enjoy your stay, the Mexican people are very friendly and because you can also use the facilities of the Yucatan and the Playacar, it is possible pick the best of all 3 hotels to suit your needs. We found the Riu Tequila to be a good base to explore the surrounding area, especially as the buses and collectivos are cheap and easy to use and because you are travelling with Mexican people, you feel that you are actually in Mexico. We never felt threatened. TIP If you are English, don\u2019t bother changing your money into US dollars, especially for the departure tax.

We stayed in Dec 08 for 2 weeks on an all inclusive deal through Thompsons. The hotel itself was huge and took some getting used to navigating around the grounds. The room was spacious and basic. It was clean and fresh so couldnt complain. The walls seemed a bit thin, so we could hear when our neighbours were watching their TV and when they were open/closing wardrobes etc (so would advise travellers to take ear plugs). The hotel food was basic and lots of dishes were repeated daily, so not much variety. There was a BBQ on every 3 days or so, which was the best food in the restaurant. The 'Beach House' restaurant was poor - the food was badly cooked and strange mixes of dishes. The new Oriental restaurant was nice with a good selection of sushi's etc although these had to be booked by 7am each morning otherwise they'd be fully booked. I suppose you get what you pay for. I have to admit we are very fussy where we stay and tend to go for really nice hotels. I'd say the Riu Tequila was average. If you want sunshine and to be fed average food every couple of hours then it's a great place. We found there to be a lot of American and Canadian people staying there and the odd English traveller... The people there seemed to be only interested in eating as much as they can and drinking as much alcohol as they could (including vodka and beer for breakfast!!). The night entertainment is a bit 'Butlins'. The staff constantly try to force you to go to the 'show's' on the evenings, which consists of them dressing up and singing and dancing... Good for the kids and the drunk adults but other than that I'd give it a miss. Outside of the hotel there are some fab archaelogical trips to do - Chichen Itza, Coba, Tullum were all amazing. Plus snorkelling with Sea Turtles is a must. I'd recommed this hotel to people who want a cheap getaway with plenty of alcohol and sun and cheesy entertainment, or people who are happy to spend time out of the hotel to do the tourist sightseeing.

The hotel is immaculate. The buffet food is about what you would expect - not fabulous but edible. I didn't expect a lot so I wasn't dissapointed. There are three \"reservation only\" restaurants in the Tequila. The mexican \"Beach House\" we didn't frequent because we live in a town in Texas with great Mexican food, and we heard negative things about the restaurant. The \"Bambu\" Oriental restaurant was terrible - a buffet style oriental place. The Steakhouse restaurant was ok, the steaks were paper thin but were very tasty, and the service was outstanding. I found several people who were at this place for like 10 days, that would drive me crazy. We were here for 5 and that was perfect. The pools are great, the beach is outstanding, but the beds in the rooms were very hard. There are no bathtubs in the rooms so far as I knew - perhaps some upper end rooms had them. We used the pool and beach across the street at the Yucaton, and it was very nice. It's no more than a 7 minute walk, and we just packed up our stuff in the morning and stayed the day. You can have breakfast and lunch at any one of 4 (2 are on the beach) hotels, but dinner is restricted to the Tequila. Every request we had to the hotel for whatever we needed was met, EXCEPT for their serious towel issues. You get issued two towel cards, and you get one beach towel per card per person per day. Ridiculous. We got used to it, but you would think they would afford some more towels considering what you're paying. We saw some folks with their own towels, so obviously they had been there before. There is a nicely stocked minibar and liqour dispenser in the room, but we didn't use that too much. The bars and bartenders were great. I wouldn't quite call this a 5 star hotel like RIU does, it's more of a 3 to 4 star because of the food. So, don't excpect gourmet food - expect upper-end cafeteria style food, plenty of it, with good service and very clean facilities. NO HOT JACUZZIS! This drove my wife nuts - she loves a nice hot tub dip after a swim or dash in the ocean, and the \"jacuzzis\" at the hotel are all pool-water temperature. Even the jacuzzis across the street in the healthclub were cold. We booked at the last minute, got a good price, so it was ok - it was ok. The nice beach and pools made it ok. Oh yeah - the Gym facilities are at best third rate. However, if you're a runner, there's plenty of places to have a nice run - it's flat as a board througout the entire development.", "Date": "December 31, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Plainsboro, New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cLoved the Riu Tequila- made for a happy trip!\u201d", "Author": "manasi_kar", "ReviewID": "UR23041679", "Content": "We stayed at the Riu Tequila between 18th-25th December 2008. This was our first visit to an all inclusive resort in Mexico and we were not dissapointed. Briefly I have broken up the review into different categories: 1. Food- really good. We are predominantly vegetarian & were slightly apprehensive about what to expect. We were not disappointed- don't miss eating at Jalisco, the main restaurant for breakfast. We loved the show stations where the food is prepared in front of you- the omeletes are to kill for! Don't miss the juice station where several types of fresh juice are prepared for you. The pastas are delicious too. The other restaurants are Bamboo(Asian) & Lupita( Steak house) where reservations are needed- make them in the morning while eating at Jalisco because seats go fast. We liked the vegetarian food at the Bamboo too. In short, plenty of food, fresh & readily available. Another restaurant option is the \"Beach Club\" which is located on the beach at the Riu Yucatan. 2. Entertainment- The staff work really hard to put up a daily entertainment program for guests. If you have kids aged between 4-12 years old, there is a kid's club for them with organized activities between 10.30-12 in the morning & again from 3-4.30 PM in the afternoon. Nemo & Mariam who run the kids club were wonderful with the kids & the kids were sad to leave at the end of our stay. They keep activities organized for adults while the little ones are in the kid's club. Then they have daily entertainment shows from 9.30 PM onwards till upto 10.30 PM. Grab a seat early for the popular ones- the Mexican themed one, the horror show & the michael jackson one. If you don't like the show at the Tequila that particular night, simply walk across & watch one of the shows at the Riu Yucatan or the Riu Playacar. Staff- can't say enough good things. The manager, Joseph is a particularly hard working guy and is always around to see that the guests are comfortable. You will often see him running around, checking things out in the restaurants, lobby, near the pool- all over the place. The front office are great- I had called ahead & requested a room near the pool & when we reached there at 1.00 PM on the 18th, they had us checked in in minutes. No hassles whatsoever! The housekeeping staff are efficient & unobstrusive & did a great job. All in all, expect great service with a smile, good food & enough activities to keep you & the little ones occupied. Our only concern was the company who arranged the transfer between the airport & the hotel- we had no problem on the way in, but while we were leaving, they got hopelessly confused & we ended up having to get our own taxi to the airport($50). The company is called HOTELBEDS, so make sure that you reconfirm your travel plans one day before departure. Would I recommend this hotel? Absolutely! we loved it & hope we have a chance to go again sometime.", "Date": "December 27, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vaughan, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGood value for the money\u201d", "Author": "thermohelp", "ReviewID": "UR23037361", "Content": "Just came back after a week at Riu Tequila which included Christmas night. We paid CAD$3,030 for 2 adults and 1 child, including flight from Toronto - the amount well spent. We've been to quite a few 5-star all inclusives, and this place was slightly below my expectations (which may be too high). I still would recommend it for the right price. What was above our expectations: 1. The rooms are recently renovated, with brand new stylish furniture. Excellent room service, which seems to reach new heights of towel-shaping art. 2. Free mini bar with hard liquor dispenser and beer in the fridge. We never used it, but it was still good to have the option. 3. The grounds are kept in immaculate condition. This includes gardens, pools, buildings, everything. 4. Wildlife is abundant at Riu Tequila and Riu Yucatan resorts, including coates, howler monkeys, ratlike rabbits or piglike rats (the proper name is aguti). The interaction with animals was quite pleasant and sometimes funny. 5. Specialty drinks were offered at the entrance to the buffet restaurant before dinner. There was also a special theme decoration around with live elements of entertainment team members dressed accordingly. It was a different drink (each one I tried was superb) and a different theme decoration every night. Bars, drinks and entertainment were adequate. Asian buffet restaurant was a pleasant surprise. Automatic self-service espresso/cappucino machines were available at buffet and beach restaurants - almost as good as commercial espresso machines. The same machines were used in the bars. What was below our expectations: 1. The resort and the beach feel crowded. Saying that we never had a problem getting a lounge chair at the pool or at the beach (you may theoretically run into such a problem if you'll sleep till noon). This is a conglomerate of 6 resorts of Riu family, and 3 of them use the same part of the beach. The beach is wide, and everyone has enough space, still there's simply too many people around at any given moment. I am writing this based on my beach experience gained at at least half-dozen other resorts. I should stress again that it's just a feeling, as there are no excessive line-ups to bars or in buffet restaurants. 2. Service was not always adequate. E.g. at the time of check-in the receptionist forgot to take our personal information (the hotel never received it, but I can live with that) and to hand us our towel cards (I couldn't live with that). 3. Only one key to the room was provided - attached to a 5\" long plastic slab which would fit in only a deep pocket. When a second key was requested, I was told that they are waiting for the extra keys to arrive from Spain. 4. Despite the fact that the beach was distant (no problem for us, the walk was pleasant, the designated alley was clean and completely shaded), the towels could be exchanged only at our resort only once a day. One day the towel person refused to exchange towels for my wife despite we didn't change them yet on that day. He just said \"Finito!\" and was seemingly gloating . I had to come and to point to a pile of clean towels in the corner of his shack to get the fresh towels. 5. Internet service: I bought 60 minutes of internet access and used less than 15 minutes of it on the first day. When I went online next day the meter showed only 12 minutes left. I had to confront the person in charge of the internet service (seemed to be independent contractor) who offered me 15 minutes for free(about 30 minutes disappeared from my account). On Christmas night the Internet access terminals were closed with a printed sign displaying: \"Due to technical problem we are closed. Will be back in 30 minutes\". Needless to say nobody was back in 30, 60 or 90 minutes that night. 6. Some entertainment shows include sexual context which I would not recommend for the young children. It's just a warning for those who consider this important. Many people wouldn't care and there were plenty of kids of all ages at the shows. 7. Steakhouse restaurant was a waste of time. You could get the same or better food in the buffet restaurant (a very good one). The shrimp in the surf & turf menu item tasted like rubber. 8. The drinking water in the resort (bottled water in the minibar, and water used for tea in the restaurant) didn't taste very good. They use some kind of regenerated or filtered water.", "Date": "December 27, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "colorado", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Experience at the Tequila!\u201d", "Author": "ColoradoSparklebunny", "ReviewID": "UR22997435", "Content": "Pros: exceptional staff, clean rooms and dining areas, close to beach, conveniently located, great food and drinks, comfortable beds, booze in the room...

Shows- again, just catered to tourists- not Mariachi music, Mexican folklore dancing, etc.- they did \"Horror Show\" or \"Poker Night\" types of shows- it's like watching game shows on Univision. About 10 mins. from the beach (which is a long walk with kids covered in sand). Also, the beach is not as beautiful as it could be because of the black sandbags in the water. So, you will like the resort if you just want to lay by the pool (beautiful) and eat and drink a lot, and be entertained at night with some humorous shows.

I must admit you do have to read between the lines though! We stayed at Tequilla for a week in April and we were really pleased with the resort. We had read negative comments about the rooms so were not too sure what to expect but we were really pleased. The rooms were clean, spacious, good balcony, mini bar which was stocked daily (a novelty as on other all inclusive holidays we have been on this is chargeable!) The rooms were a tad old fashioned and very very green but it matched the setting. I dont think a contemporary style room would have looked right?! It was our wedding anniversary the day we arrived and our cleaner must of seen the cards and prepared a lovely flower arrangement for us which we thought was a nice touch. As others have mentioned the towel arrangements were great and we often wondered what we would get when we came back to the room! it definately makes a refreshing change from petals! The resort facilities were excellent and there were lots of options for food so we did not get bored. We ate in the main restaurant most of the time but there was the option to eat at the restaurant near the beach and the pool if you booked in advance which made a nice change. Every night there seemed to be a different theme in the main lobby area and in terms of effort and attention to detail, this was the best hotel we have stayed at. The staff work so hard to ensure the guests have a good time. We were in the restaurant on the second day and a manager walked by and asked if we were happy with our stay, we advised yes but it would be nice to have softer pillows (used to these at home!). A call was made into house keeping immediately and when we returned to the room the pillows were there. Thats service for you! The walk to the beach was no problem at all, others have moaned about it but we enjoyed the exercise after all the food! And there was always the option of catching the buggy back which was fun! The beach was lovely, although under repair and the only downside was the sea was too rough to swim in. We did prefer the beach though to the pool area as there was a great breeze and it was less crowded. Another thing which stood out was the wildlife around the resort, we saw lots of racoons, lizards, and pig like creatures!! I think we paid approx \u00a3650 each through Thomson on a last minute deal and felt that we had excellent value for money. Our only regret is we did not go for 2 weeks. There was so much to do in and around the hotel 1 week was too short especially as it was a long flight. We would of liked to have done more trips, we did the Dolphin experience which was great! Also as April is holiday season for schools in the UK and America the hotel was very busy so when we return (which we will) we will avoid school holiday period.

HOWEVER, once we got inside our room, we were shocked at how terrible it was... more like 1-star quality! Everything looked like it was 20 years old, the beds were SO hard (btw a king bed is just 2 Queens pushed together), it was not very clean... and the worst part is, the room was INFESTED with mosquitos. There were literally over 100 mosquitos in our room and we were told by the staff that every room would be the same. They attempted to spray the room but that obviously doesnt work on flying insects. The only way we could make it a little better was by dropping the A/C down to 60'F (which I heard freezes mosquito wings). Luckily, there was so much to do, we barely spent any time in the room. We avoided being in there at all costs! Also, you can use the ammenities at the other Riu hotel across the street. If I return, I will stay at the Riu Palace instead of Tequila, which I'm assuming has better rooms. Other than that, our trip was unforgettable. The hotel is perfectly located - close to tour buses, shops, beach, etc. FYI - the hotel is across the street from the beach but there are shuttle rides if you don't want to make the 3-min walk.

We booked through Thomson and had no problems with the flights or the reps. Arrival - When we arrived at the hotel we were given our all inclusive wristbands, a drink, and a pack with our room key, safe key and map of the resort, and then left our cases in reception for the porters to take to our rooms whilst we wandered off to find the room. We had a ground floor room near the back of the complex which was a pleasant walk through the pretty grounds with the occasional wild animal around, including bats at night as we got further away from the main hotel! Room - Our first impression of our room was that it was big! Two double beds pushed together! A few reviews have said the beds were hard but we had no problems sleeping at all. There was separate bathroom area, with curtains that you could pull across, including sink, shower, wardrobe, fridge, optics, and a separate room with toilet in. The balcony door had a separate bug screen which was nice but we tended to keep the balcony door shut so that the air con would stay on. The air con was very good (occasionally got a bit cold and needed to go out of the room to warm up!) and there was also a ceiling fan. The room was lovely and cool to come into after a day outside in the sun. The maid did a great job cleaning the room and filled our fridge every other day with water, pepsi, fizzy orange, 7up, & corona. She also left us towel animals every few days which were pretty cool and nice to come in to! Great having the optics in the room too. Food - The food was lovely. We didn't bother to book to go to the Mexican or steak house and just ate at the buffet for the whole holiday. There was so much choice and we always found something that we wanted to eat! Breakfast had more choice than I have ever seen - cereals, cooked food like bacon, sausage etc, fresh fruit juices, pastries, salads, donuts, pancakes, boiled eggs, fried eggs, and an omlette station where you could get an omlette made with whatever you wanted in it. Amazing! Lunch was served in the restaurant by the pool and offered a good selection. We had lunch a couple of times at the Yucatan when we were at the beach in the day, and once at the Riu Cancun when we went there for the day, and although they were all similar we much preferred the Tequila as the food just seemed better and had more variety. Pool area - The pools were lovely. Yes there is paint peeling off as some reviews have said but that really doesn't make any difference! It's lovely and cool to get into in the hot sun and they are always around with a net getting the leaves and things out of the water. The loungers right in front of the water tended to be gone by the time we got there at about 11am but we never had any trouble finding loungers and parasols a bit further back which was actually nicer as you then don't have people walking past you all day. The pool area was nice and lively with bingo, salsa dancing, water polo & beach volleyball, table tennis etc on the adjacent man made beach, but they don't harass you to join in which was great as I prefer to just watch (apart from the one day when I got dragged on to the \"beach\" to join in some dancing!). Towels \u2013 You have to hand in your towel card when you want a beach towel and you get the card back when you give the towel back. I thought this was great as I didn\u2019t realise this would be the case and had actually taken my own beach towel! However you are only allowed one towel each per day which we weren\u2019t told until we tried to get another one in the afternoon after taking ours back earlier. Luckily they let us have the extra ones in the afternoon that day but bear it in mind and keep hold of your towel all day if you think you will need it later on! Beach - The beach was beautiful, soft white sands, which doesn\u2019t get hot, and turquoise water. Yes it has eroded quite a lot but that's just nature and they are trying to stop that with the huge sandbags which really didn't spoil the beach for us. The beach is located a short walk away from the hotel through a shaded walkway which was a nice walk. Probably took about 10 mins and we never bothered with the golf buggy to take you there as the walk was nice. The only problem for us was that we didn't tend to make it to the beach very early (not before 11am) and so most of the loungers with parasols or shade from trees closer to the main section of beach tended to be gone. As the beach has a lovely sea breeze and the sun is above you all day it is too easy to get burnt without a parasol and we tended to have to sit right at the back where it seemed like they had extended the beach backwards so it wasn\u2019t the same white sand and you couldn't really see the sea from there! Still great though. One day we went out on one of the catamarans that you can use for free which was a lot of fun! Entertainment - this was great. Lots of different shows, mostly consisting of dance routines and some miming to songs, but also karaoke one night and a variety show with members of the audience. Lots of fun. My only complaint would be that the entertainment was only on for about an hour and a half. Location - The hotel is in an all inclusive resort surrounded by other hotels so it feels very safe. There was a small complex of shops located just a short walk away from the hotel which were nice to browse around without being pressured into buying anything. There were also phone boxes located here. Playa del Carmen was about 5 mins away in a taxi and only cost a few dollars - a bit of a long walk in the heat if your not very good in the sun like me! We walked there near the beginning of the holiday and I nearly died! Had a massive cocktail from a bar on the beach at playa del carmen though which was great! Playa del Carmen has lots of shops, and in a couple of them you do feel slightly pressured to buy things but it wasn't too bad. Also numerous bars if you fancy a change of scenery in the evening. We only made it out one evening as I didn't want to miss the shows in the hotel! Excursions \u2013 We spent a lot of time around the pool area and the beach, where it was good that you could use the Yucatan's facilities, but also went on a few trips which were also fun. I recommend Xcaret, Coba and Aktun Chen. If you do go to Xcaret then paying for an xcaret plus ticket is well worth it as it includes the entrance fee and also a towel, locker hire, snorkel, flippers, 2 drinks, and lunch with another drink. Staying for the evening show which was really good meant that we were out for over 12 hours \u2013 great value but very tiring! Chichen Itza was also cool to go and see but a very long journey and I preferred Coba as you can actually climb up the main pyramid and you can get a lift from a bicycle taxi to get back across the site! We went into Cancun one day on the bus from Playa del Carmen which was a bit of a nightmare as we didn\u2019t know where to get off and ended up just wandering around in the sun until we found the Riu Cancun where we could get our free food and drinks in the air conditioned hotel! We didn\u2019t really like what we saw of Cancun and it made us happy that we had chosen the Tequila, though the Riu Cancun did look very nice. Playa del Carmen seemed much nicer. Although having said that I would go back to Cancun again for a day or an evening, just on an organised trip as it is far too big! All in all we had a great holiday, I would love to go back to the Tequila and I'm sure it will be even better once the refurb. has been done. The staff were all so friendly and it was lovely getting a \u201chola\u201d from everyone who passed you. I would recommend this hotel to everyone as it has something to offer everybody no matter what type of holiday you are after. You can join in the activities or chill out as much as you want and there are lots of other things to do in the area.", "Date": "August 27, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Richmond, VA", "Title": "\u201cRiu Tequila RULES!!!\u201d", "Author": "jef400", "ReviewID": "UR19348109", "Content": "We booked our vacation on the internet through a friend recommended website. It was a monday to monday trip meant to avoid weekend delays at check ins/outs. It appeared to have worked. I booked this trip for my girlfriend and I, we are 24 and 28. We spent most of the spring trying to get other friends to commit to a week in anywhere from Cabo to Aruba. We settled on Playa del Carmen because of the value. This was a also our first time at an All Inclusive resort. We settled on PDC because I wanted to do some excursions, mainly seeing some Mayan ruins. I read every review on the site we booked from as well as another \"cheap caribbean...\" site and many traveler reviews on tripadvisor. I picked the Riu Tequila because it was the highest (tripadvisor) ranked AI resort in PDC that was in our price range ($1300pp with airfare from Richmond, VA). If I could have convinced my girlfriend to spend more money, we may have stayed at the Riu Riviera Maya Palace that was right up the street. To stay there for the week would have cost us another $300 per person, and in hindsight, I\u2019m glad we didn\u2019t. I think the reason Tequila ranked higher than the other Riu resorts in the vicinity was because of the food. Some places may claim better beaches, pools, bar scenes, entertainment etc., but if you think about it, are you going to use those 3 times everyday? The food was so good that we still ate the buffet our last night and the morning of departure. More on the food in a minute. I am rating our overall trip as 4.5 out of 5. The reasons it wasn\u2019t perfect were very insignificant to us. If you're a high maintenance fussy type of person, getting two queen beds pushed together instead of the king you requested may be a big deal. I have definitely stayed at much finer accommodations (THEHotel Mandalay Bay in Vegas for instance) than the Riu Teq. The beds were as firm as I expected them to be (thanks again fellow reviewers). Every time we opened our door after dark 3 tiny mosquitoes would fly in. No drinking the tap water. There was a screw missing in the handle to our storm door. The safe locks are pretty low tech and require you to keep up with a key on a rope, which I lost and had to pay a $50 charge to have maintenance drill it out. Also our travel rep failed to meet us two separate occasions (not to be attributed to the Riu Teq though). Despite all of this, if I could choose to redo any vacation I've ever been on, ClubHotel Riu Tequila in PDC wins HANDS DOWN! Excursions- We took reviewers advice and went for a stroll up 5th Ave and found discounted tours. We bought 3 days worth at once for a better deal. We did a 4 hour ATV tour that was $55pp because we shared one ATV. That consisted of about an hour and half of riding on heavily worn paved roads through the \" jungle\" (woods) to a spot where we stopped to rest then went through a an hour cave tour. That was pretty fun and definitely worth the money. The next day we had booked a $105pp all day excursion to Tulum/Xel-Ha. Tulum was the ancient Mayan ruins I had wanted to see. Chitzen Itza is the huge spectacular one that has the temple you can walk up. That one was a 3 hour bus ride each way though. Tulum was smaller but only an hour from our hotel. It was cloudy when we got there, and pouring raining by the end of our tour. FYI Mayan mosquitoes LOVE tourists in the rain. We finished there around 10:30a then headed to Xel-Ha (pronounced \"shell ha\"). Xel-Ha is pretty much an outdoor water park that was built at the mouth of a small river that flows into a harbor then the gulf. The cost of this trip also covered AI inside Xel-Ha. There were at least 3 different options to eat all, all being feed yourself buffet style. The food was average, the drinks were free ;). There was all kinds of stuff to do there. You could pay extra to swim with the dolphin- we didn\u2019t. There were bikes and a trail to ride on, they had a great lazy river to float on that started on a narrow stream up in a thicket, then flowed into a wider river which was blocked just short of the mouth of the harbor. It was blocked presumably to keep predator fish out and their fish in. They claim to be the largest outdoor natural aquarium...or something like that. You could also snorkel all you wanted. A $20 dollar deposit was required to use their equipment but no charge if you had your own. AND GET THIS, THEY HAD FREE LOCKERS, all sizes!!! I couldn\u2019t believe that, I\u2019ve been to many water/amusement parks and never have I seen such a lack of nickel and dimage!!! They also had 2 different cliffs to jump off of right off the Lazy river. They were about 2 stories high, I jumped both, pretty fun. There was also a rope swing hidden in the back of the resort. That was very lame by my standards. A rope swing requires a risk of SERIOUS physical injury to impress me. Call me a rope swing snob..oh well. By the time 4 rolled around we were beat- they even have hammock on the beach with a beautiful view of the harbor and park. Our final excursion was was chartered fishing trip for 2 of us for 4 hours. We were told we could also snorkel if we wished. This was $200 total and did not include transportation to and from the pier. That caused a little confusion and resulted in me getting the captain return us to our hotel later so I could adequately tip the mate. Upon seeing the 25' glorified john boat we were going in, we were a little disappointed at first. I have been on a few chartered trips and know that they are expensive and that most of the $ goes to gas. The captain and mate were very polite and friendly. They were simultaneously professional and personable. We swapped fishing stories, and they helped my spanish for the first hour or two, then we started getting some bites. I caught 2 small \"yellow tails\" one other similar sized fish I think they called a \"gullet\"...? Then I got a good hit. It turned out to be about a 4lb red snapper. It fought pretty well for the 3-5 minutes that it took to get him in the boat. We trolled around for another hour or so then stopped for some snorkeling. I used my own equipment again and had planned on jumping in, swimming around a few minutes then calling it a day (my girlfriend doesn\u2019t snorkel). I knew she was already bored out of her mind, hot and getting cranky so I didn\u2019t want to leave her in a boat with two strangers. However the mate suited up and jumped in too. After we were both in the water, the boat left. I was nervous for a second then the mate informed me he was just going to the other end of the reef. We swam about 200 yards to the boat, and I have to say, it was BEAUTIFUL! Much more clear than the day before at the murky Xel-Ha. After we were done the mate cleaned my catch, walked us up to a restaurant on the beach, handed the waiter my catch and for $26 we had a few beers, a few sodas, chips and salsa, my fish grilled in garlic butter (with its head still on!!) rice and a salad. We both ate as much of the fish as we could and still threw away about a 1/3. This was one of the two meals we ate outside our resort and it was cheap and GREAT! One other \u201cexcursion\u201d that we did that wasn\u2019t offered as a package was Cozumel. For those not already familiar, Cozumel is a small island about 20miles off the coast of PDC, visible from the beach in good weather. There is a ferry that runs every hour from the harbor ($5 cab ride from the hotel, about 2-3 miles). The ferry is $24 round trip per person. It takes about 45mins from the time you get on the boat to the time you get off. Upon arrival we were met by a bunch of people trying to rent us anything they possibly could. We settled on a red 1967 red Volkswagen Beetle Convertible. It was $40 for the day plus $50 deposit because I didn\u2019t have my driver\u2019s license with me. You can drive around the whole island (that\u2019s open to tourist) in about an hour by car. The coastal route is 65km or about 40miles. Many people rent scooters and they are much slower on the open parts of the road. We drove south to the first public beach- San Francisco Beach. It wasn\u2019t as large or as nice as the one at our hotel. But it did have a few water toys- a three story tall inflatable \u201ciceberg\u201d that had handles to climb up and a few water trampolines. There were also a few bars that had waiters bringing your drinks to you on the beach. We did not have this service at our hotel. Then we rode around some, and stopped at the Bob Marley Bar at the southern tip of the island. If you like reggae music at all, this is a must! No doors, all open patio bar ON the beach. Go early though; they close at six due to\u2026electricity? Our only bad experience in Cozumel was when we returned the rental car. The renter told me to put $10 (USD) in gas in the car. At the full service only gas station, I repeated that same amount. They filled it up and said I owed $24USD. I argued with the attendants and said they can un-pump $14 if they want, but I\u2019m only paying $10. We eventually settled on me paying $20, them giving me a receipt and getting reimbursed the other $10 from the renter. This sounded logical to me since he would reap the rewards of the extra gas. When I tried to get another $10 back with my deposit, I was met with a repetitive \u201cEez no my pro\u2019lem\u201d. Then we had a crappy meal at an authentic Mexican restaurant. The service was outstanding, the food was gross. Thank you very much Cozumel, see ya NEVER. Pool/Beach From what I read about all the beaches in PDC, and from other reviewer\u2019s photographs, I was pretty sure the beach would be crappy and we would spend most of our time at the pool. I couldn\u2019t have been more wrong. Riu Tequila is not on the beach, or even on the beach side of the road. Every 5-10 minutes from 7a-1p, then again from 3p-6p, a member of the hotel staff drives a stretched 3 row golf cart that can seat about 8 people to and from the beach. If you miss the ride, it\u2019s maybe a total of 200 yards from the entrance of the hotel to the sand (5-7 minute casual stroll). From where the sand starts to where the water breaks is about 70 yards- plenty of sand. The first 20 yards is under palm tree cover. The beach is beautiful white sand that no matter how hot and sunny it was, never got too hot to walk on. Directly in front of the hotel\u2019s entrance to the beach, (where the water breaks) you could see that some sandbags had been buried. But they were mostly covered with sand and no where near as noticeable as other parts of the beach. Also there was a lack of slippery moss coating on these sandbags compared to those in front of other hotels. About 20-30 yards out there were other HUGE black sandbags that sat about 5ft above the water line. With a little practice, you could climb on top of these and sit and rest. The depth of the water approaching them was over 6ft, so you could dive or flip off of them without risking of hitting bottom. As we walked up the beach, I noticed some resorts had signs up prohibiting people from walking or climbing on the sandbags. Tequila is more lenient I suppose. Another thing about the beach, if you\u2019re American and have small children, be warned, a good portion of the rest of the world does share your reticence about covering skin. This applies to both sexes. Men in short shorts and women topless, and not just the beautiful. On our second to last day, I was finally able to talk my girlfriend into parasailing. It was $100 for both of us, and definitely worth it. We were up in the air for about 10mins and got to see a large portion of PDC as well as Cozumel. We never spent much time at the pool. The first day, we had our bathing suites in our carry on so we could go straight to the swim up bar after check in. It was fun; however because of our lack of sleep the night before, we got too drunk too fast! The bartenders at the pool bar were a lot of fun. I regret not going back there anymore, but mild stomach aches kept my girlfriend from being in the mood to get hammered again \uf04c Food As I said, this was our first experience with an AI resort. I heard mixed reviews of AIs, some completely discouraging others ranged from mild to OK. I am a very picky eater. I can\u2019t stand most crunchy vegetable, especially onions. These buffets were DELICIOUS! There were several regulars that you could find everyday; hamburgers and hot dogs (ehhh) and pizza. We never tried the hamburgers and hotdogs, but did eat the pizza twice. It was better than it looked and it didn\u2019t look bad either. Some sort of rice could always be found, as well as some enchilada looking small wrap or tacito (they had onions- no thanks). The pasta station that was in the dinner buffet was so good, I ate it 3 nights in a row. And I\u2019m not some weirdo that does that routinely back home either- it really was that good. There were several toppings bowls that contained mushrooms, onions, green peppers, zucchini, carrots, shallots, shrimp, and salmon all diced up in bite sized pieces. You put what you want on a plate then when it\u2019s your turn (there was always a line-it was that good) you hand it to the cook; he fries it in front of you. There was 4 types of pasta to select from, then 3 sauces; white, tomato, and meat sauce. Two of the three nights I had this, I went back for seconds. I could write another 4 pages on the food alone, but I\u2019ll stop here. If you have any questions you\u2019d like to ask me about their food, feel free to drop me a line. Oh yeah, and eat at the Steak restaurant at least once. Service The service from everyone in the entire country is like nothing in America. You get the sense that everyone from the bus boys, to massage therapist want you to be as happy as possible. Even the taxi drives are genuinely considerate. They would stop in the street and smile and let you pass in front of their car. Where ever there are rules, or \u201cdo not\u2026\u201d signs, you get the feeling they are more like request than prohibitions. The Steak restaurant had a sign that said no wet swim suites, I saw several people everyday violating this, never once was anyone reprimanded. This would never work in America, people would complain too much. But in paradise, it works wonderfully. I would suggest anyone who has ever griped about illegal immigrant workers spend a week in PDC. The sincerity they show Americans is bewildering. In closing, if you have the extra money and prefer a big rocking pool scene, and a beach view, check out Riveria Maya Palace. We didn\u2019t eat there, but assuming that the same ownership would entail similar food choices, this may better suite you. I booked the Tequila because it ranked higher on Tripadvisor\u2019s ranking system. If I were to return to PDC with a group of friends, I might stay at the RMP.

ROOMS My room was smelly and damp the air con didn't seem to work properly the vent was filthy. The mini fridge was rusty and couldn't say when the inside was last cleaned. The shower had a large chip out of the marble step. The bed had a leg that kept falling off and it bowed in the middle it was also very hard even with a mattress topper. FOOD AND DRINKS Be prepared to Que for drinks as this hotel has no waiter service Drinks were served in the sports bar in plastic cups and if they ran out of clean cups you got your beer in a polystyrene cups. Food was very repetitive and at times it wasn't very warm it was basically the same in the main restaurant every night with a different meat or fish. 24hr snacks consisted of leftover hamburgers, hot dogs,pizzas that you heated in the microwave in the sports bar and sandwiches made with hard bread. They ran out of snacks quite frequently. POOL There is a open restaurant there as well it was pretty much the same as the main restaurant repetitive You have to watch your plate as the birds will eat of it if you leave it to get a drink (they are a nuisance) there is also a lot of cats about this area also there is a strong sewage smell about this area. The sunbed area had a lot of plates and cups lying about it wasn't kept tidy. It was hard to get a sunbed in the morning as the towel game was played here. The pools had paint peeling off the bottom and frequently had dead insects floating in the water. ENTERTAIMENT The animation team tried very hard but in my opinion the shows were very cheesy it was OK if you were 10yrs old. GROUNDS The gardens were kept immaculate the gardeners worked very hard. OVERALL I felt very let down by the Riu chain as I stayed In the RIU Cancun last year the hotel had the same rating as the Tequila but it s standards and services were by far more superior than the Tequila I would not return to this hotel and would not recommend it.

The rooms were a good size and the optics and mini fridge wer filled to the brim!! The hotel itself is awesome - i cannot see for one minute why anyone would not like this property - i think anyone picking fault is just nit picking and looking for problems that arent there!!! Yes there is a 10 minute walk to the beach, this is stated in the brochure and if you want to be closer - (just over the rd) stay in the yucatan or the playacar all of which you can use when staying in the riu chain in playacar. we found the 10 minute walk helped walked off the lovely food and drink that we ate and drank for 14 days!!! the beach has sandbags on but this is to stop the beach eroding anymore! The breeze on the beach is very welcome, round the pool in July it hit 40degrees on quite a few occasions. Staff - from managers walking round the restaurant every day and night asking if everything is ok to the gardeners working all hours keeping the place tidy - they are all so so friendly. THe entertainment staff are GREAT they work such long hours and put on excellent shows every night! Always with a smile. (the michale jackson, mayan and comedy shows are a must see) The bar staff - especially those at the swim up bar seem to really enjoy their jobs, we got wrong for only having 2 cocktails before 12oclock midday haha - the staff wanted to know why we didnt want more!! You were always greeted with a smile, the bar menu is extensive but they are always willing to make you anything you ask for (try the mexican flag) Food - main buffet restaurant - had a WIDE WIDE range of food how anyone can say repetitive is beyond me - the only way this food would be repetitive is if you literally started at the top and worked your way down the 7 food stations getting one of everything - yes there was chicken every night - yes there was steak every night but there was always a different sauce to go with it and always something different to choose from should you wish. The steak house was OUT OF THIS WORLD!! VERY VERY nice - i had chargrilled steak and heard someone beside me saying it tasted \"burnt\" - hmm. We didnt try the mexican restaurant as there was always a mexican dish in the main restaurant. trips - we did some once in a lifetime trips, firstly we went and snorkelled with the whalesharks which was amazing, you literally swim alongside these huge sharks for as long as you want, on the same trip we saw manta ray, dolphins and a turtle. you get a snorkel on a reef after the sharks followed by a trip to a small island for lunch (with beer supplied on the boat along the way - you didnt get chance to finish a bottle and another was in your hand) we also went on the F1 experience - this is a MUST DO - simon is great (i asked him to swap jobs with me and he wouldnt - cant understand why ha) you go out on a speedboat to the bay of turtles and snorkel alongside the turtles, they dont mind you being there and come up for air etc - we got some awesome photos. They also take you to a reef and a secluded beach for lunch, very very nice, after lunch settles, you race back on the speedboats - very fast and great great fun. we took the ferry over to cozumel from playa del carmen one day- little tip dont sit outside you get very very wet!!!! Cozumel is lovely for shopping and very pretty, playa del carmen itself is also worth a look 5th avenue with its \"tat\" shops and duty free. All in all we had a fab fab holiday and will definitley be returning once the reburb is complete. dont listen to any of the negative reviews - you cant please everyone - the hotel is great, people, food, drink, area. all SUPERB!!!

Location. Not beach front, so not as busy as the Yucutan. No see breeze means very hot days by the pool. 8/10 Room. Out dated, beds hard and old. Constantly got the feeling you weren't alone in them! small bugs around the bathroom area. The A/C was also poor which is crucial in such a climate. Plus point was that we were at the far point of the complex so it was very quiet. Our balcony was disappointing as there were large palm trees right up against it with no real view as such so we did not use it. Our room was cleaned and tidied daily to a good standard. 5/10 Food - Lot's of choice but repetitve by the second week. Steak house poor unless you like your steaks less than 1cm thick. Mexican reasonable. You'll spend most time in the large buffet hall. Salads looked good as was the ice cream 7/10. Staff - Very good, friendly and willing to help. Reception very responsive in correcting any minor issues we had. 9/10 Entertainment. Great friendly reps though the programme was very repetitive. Once you've seen the shows the first week you don't want to see them the second. Hotel could of done with a bar away from it all for those not wanting to sit through the shows. 7/10 Pool. Clean, though ear infections around the swim up pool bar were an issue for some guests. People did seem to stay a long time drinking at the swim up bar withou getting out of the water :( Also a lot of stones are kicked into the pool, I cut/bruised my foot as did others, not major no blood. A good layout and plenty of room. 7/10 Beach. Clean water and sand, plenty of sports on offer and plenty of beds. You can also grab a drink at the Yucutan. A lot of sand eroded and a reclamation project is in progress which consists of sinking large sand bags (look like beached whales), looks ugly but everyone seems to have a great time jumpng and diving of them, at your own risk of course! These bags also hinder the statutory walk along the shallows for the romantics amongst you. 7/10 Hotel. Most definately not 5* as stated by Riu and would argue against 4* by Thomson. I visited Bermuda last year same rated hotel 4* which was way out of the league of this one. Decor is outdated, towels are well worn, as are carpets and chairs in main dining area. Also there is regional football graffiti carved into the wood of room and public toilets. By the way 24 hr all inclusive does not mean a chef ruslting up something for you in the middle of the night, it means the left over food and a microwave in the sportsbar. If you want brand drinks ask for them else you get local. 6/10 Overall holiday experience. Good for kids and families, my kids had a great time (boys aged 11 & 9). Not the best for couples seeking a get away. Hotel was closing for refurb (Wed. 20th August 08) 3 days after our return so the place was a ghost town from the Saturday, food got less and less choice, this was very poor. Plus point for those considering this hotel is that you get a completely renovated hotel for 2009 and a new Japanese restaurant! 7/10 Would I go again, probably not to this hotel but would consder one of the Palaces across the road. If you liked Spain back in the '80s and '90s then this is the place for you. Trips: very expensive with tour op. Ball park figures are as follows (in US $): Chichen Itza $99 adults, $59 children- 3.5 Hr bus journey each way, or by air $329 adults and children Tulum tour $38 adults, $23 children Coba Mayan village, $95 adults, $47.50 children Whale Shark experience (which did sound really good) $265 adults and children. ps it's a 06.00 am start! Dolphin Swim $149 adults and children Captain Hooks Dinner Cruise, $94 adults and $49 children There are loads more trips varying in prices. Essentials - Tipping: We made sure our cleaner Francisco had a regular tip as we felt he earnt it. It had been suggested in previous reviews to tip for the mini bar. Frankly I just would not bother. Yes you do get extra but we just didn't drink in our room to justify it. It seemed like money for nothing in comparison to someone cleaning our room. we noticed when we did not tip we no longer got Pepsi in our fridge!! you want a drink, go to the bar! Insects: They all bite especially the first week, once you get a tan they seem to ease off! Take protection including a room plug in. Sun screen. If you've noot been this far south use a 50 on the kids, the sun is very strong and above you all day.

I was a little shaky on the airline because I had heard so many conflicting stories. It was $2000 for all 5 of us, round trip, which was considerably less than a 'regular' airline. The flight was great, the service great and very efficient. I highly recommend Vivaerobus, but be sure to pay with a credit card to avoid 'issues'. Also, pay for the priority boarding. It makes a difference. There was a loud and obnoxious group that flew with us who figured out that if one person paid for priority, they could save 3 rows for their group....hmmm. Not enough to ruin my vacation, but kind of cheap and petty. A note on the hotels. When we booked, the Tequila was about $1,000 cheaper than the Yucatan. We thought that was enough of a difference to stay at the Tequila....the walk to the beach didn't bother us because we're pretty athletic. We made the right choice. 2. Riu Tequila. Grounds- The Tequila is charming. We loved the grounds, the peace and quiet, the pool area is very tropical and lush. We aren't pool people, but it seemed lovely. We much preferred the down to earth charm of both the Tequila and the Yucatan to the Palaces. I thought they were kind of pretentious and out place for the beach, but that's personal preference. Rooms- The rooms were dated, but surprisingly large. We had 2 rooms that were not connected but side by side. We ordered a roll away and got it. The minifridge had drinks and LOTS of water. The towels smelled kind of musty, but hey, it's the tropics. Tons of towels, and we got new ones everyday. The shower was strong (my pet peeve!) and large....2 person for sure! :) The beds were hard, and I like that! The a/c was so cold, I had to put an extra blanket on the bed. Our rooms had the liquor dispensers, but no liquor, which was ok with us- we don't drink that much, and it was better for our teenagers not to have it around.... Food- We ate dinner at the Tequila everynight and it was delicious. We are 'foodies', and were not disappointed. My theory is that because there are so many Europeans, there is a sort of mandate for the cooking to be good...and it was. I didn't taste a single bad dish. With little kids, the buffet was a godsend, our 7 year old was in heaven with handmade pizzas to order, mac and cheese, bean and cheese tacos. Our vegetarian was thrilled with all the veg entrees. Our 13 year old son was happy to fill his plate over and over. The Rius definitely lost money on him! :) The deserts are magnificent. You will NOT be disappointed with the food. We ate at the Mexican restaurant, it was outdoors and very good. We also ate at the Steak House, it was good, but being from Texas, well, hard to beat our steaks! Getting a 7.00 seating was not a problem, but I think that the 9.30 seatings go fast. We're Americans, so we eat early! Entertainment- The staff works hard. The shows are goofy, and lots of fun. It's not a professional production, but their heart is in the right place. They had a great tropical band. The sports bar is open 24 hours for food and coffee, and that's where the internet is. They charge $5 for 15 minutes. I recommend the Riu Yucatan- $8 for an hour. More on that later. I don't know about the entertainment during the day, because we weren't there. Front Desk- Very responsive and helpful. They found a wheelchair for one of our kids...more on that later. Beach Trolley- The man who drives the trolley is wonderful, very sweet. The trolley seats 7, so you may find it faster to walk, and it's a quick walk. Good exercise and covered. 3. Riu Yucatan As I said, we're not pool people, we much prefer the beach, and that's where we spent most of our day. The Yucatan's pool is just steps from the beach, and you can watch kids in the pool and the beach if you have a chair at the pool. Our teenagers would go back and forth. -Beach Any beach is a good beach...we even love the Texas coast! There are many beach chairs and lots of shade, thanks to the palm trees. No beach service, and the showers weren't always working. A bathroom is close by. Lots of topless ladies of all shapes and sizes. :) Lots of gentlemen in tiny suits, and not many of them are Michael Phelps look alikes! :) The first day is kind of shocking, but by the 2nd or 3rd day, you're fine. NOTE ON THE BEACH..... This beach is lovely, but the sand bags are a problem. The husband and kids loved jumping off, but on day 2, the beach workers were pumping up the 'whales' and had sand spilled all over the place...the sand covered one of the whales and our 7 year old jumped off one of the higher whales onto what he thought was the ocean bottom...it was actually one of the whales. He broke his ankle. At the time, we thought it was just bruised up, so we watched it for the rest of the day and the next day, when he still couldn't walk on it, we took him to HOSPITEN, the private hospital in Playacar. It was very clean, modern and plush. The first thing they do is put a $800 hold on your credit card...so be prepared. They xrayed his foot and said it wasn't broken...but a week later he wasn't able to walk on it, we say our home orthopedist and sure enough, fracture on his growth plate. Of course it was our fault for letting him play on the whale, but BEWARE. They are dangerous. We saw several other people who were similarly injured...twisted knee ligaments, broken arm, broken wrist. BE CAREFUL. Ok, rant over. Pool. The Riu Yucatan pool is lots of fun, very crowded and animated. We are runners, so we would get up very early to run and leave our towels...all the pool chairs were gone by 6.30. We'd run one at a time (on the main Playacar road, about 4 miles) and the other would stay by the pool, that's the fair way to do it. I really get crabby with those who put down a towel at 6.00 and don't come back until 2.00 pm!!! I highly recommend bringing your own towels, as the Riu staff will remove the Riu towels if you use them to save chairs. In fairness, they don't know if they're left from the day before. Other guests will move them, too. We are early risers, so for us, it's not a problem. That's a choice you have to make! Food. Similar to the Tequila, but I think that the Tequila was better...personal preference I guess. We ate outside at lunch and it was so-so. We discovered the main dining room was open at 1.00, so we started eating inside after that. Much cooler and a better selection. Internet. I highly suggest you use the Yucatan for internet access. They have wireless laptops you can rent (don't know cost...this was too much for me, I wanted to relax!) and for $8 you could get 1 hour of internet split up as you wanted. Great for just checking in. The room is hotter than H*LL, so just pop in to the gift shop to cool down, it's an ice chest! Entertainment- The poolside entertainment is pretty crazy. The bingo guy is nuts, '69, the international number' got me some questions from my 7 year old...'Why is it the international number, mommy?\" hmmm...but they're funny. The kids loved the ping pong and shooting competition. The water aerobics are funny and goofy. Guests- The clientele of both Rius is highly European. We, as Americans, are definitely in the minority. We are used to tipping, bbut found it was not at all common. We tipped $2-4 at breakfast and lunch and $5-7 at dinner. We tipped $2 per room for the maids, except for the day the 7 year old wet the bed ($5 that day!)_and we also tipped the beach driver $10 on the last day. 3. Excursions We booked a day with EDVENTURES, in part because of the great reviews on TA. It was great dealing with Bonnie, very professional and friendly. We booked 3 ziplines, swimming in the lagoon, snorkling in the cenote, swimming with the turtles, swimming in the 'aquarium' and Tulum. All the activities were amazing! The guide, Gil, was just great, and the driver as well. We were paired up with another US family and we had a blast. My only crititque, which I shared with Eduardo, was that it wasn't very specific that lunch was EXTRA. We went to a fabulous beachside place whose name has escaped me....anyway....we had to dip into the tip money to pay for lunch, because I thought it was included. We had enough for beer, so no problem! :) I highly recommend Eduardo's outfit. 4. Shopping We went into PDC proper one evening and it was fine, very commercial and I felt somewhat overpriced. The little shopping center in Playacar was just fine for quick shopping, and I think if time is a problem, shopping for souvenirs in Playacar is ok. My daughter was thrilled to find an American Apparel in PDC, I was saddened...I remember when it was truly a little village! There are some very cool shops in PDC and Playacar that have some original/artistic crafts. All in all, a great vacation...lots of good family time, beautiful weather, great food. The foot will heal and we'll be back! Have fun! I recommend: -bring your own pillow -pack lightly -bring lots of sunscreen and bug spray -tip when you have good service -use hand sanitizer frequently and before you eat...this is key to not getting stomach 'issues' -see at least one sunrise!", "Date": "August 18, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "northeast england", "Title": "\u201cnice beach, shame about the hotel\u201d", "Author": "reazy1", "ReviewID": "UR18875143", "Content": "We stayed at the riu Tequila on a 2 week all inclusive at the end of july 08.

We requested a change of room and were shown a first floor alternative which was marginally better as it did not smell of damp.The towels and linnen were very old and threadbare and were possibly as old as the ten year hotel. Although the hotel grounds and pool areas are pleasant they did not appear to be cleaned very often and were in need of repair. It was a ten minute walk to the beach through a covered walkway which was full of biting insects. A golf buggy was available however it only seated 10 people and often it was quicker to walk. The beach was fantastic, very clean and well worth the walk although the sunbeds were reserved with towels quite early in the day. The quality of the food in the dining room was acceptable however it was not what i expected and it was repetitive. At times the waiter service left a bit to be desired although the bar staff were very friendly. During our stay we discovered the tequila was due to be closed down for refubishment 2 weeks after our departure and feel that Thomson should not have been advertising this hotel as a platinum holiday.

This is the second time that we have been to the Riu Tequila, but we got married their. We first travelled to the Tequila in 2006 and loved it so much we decided to get married there. There were 18 of us that travelled between the ages of 18-50 and everyone really enjoyed themselves. The hotel itself is of a high standard, the gardens and pathways around the hotel are kept imaculate, rooms are spacious and clean, the pool area is large with a lovely swim up bar, the pool is split into two, one area for relaxing and another for watersports and games. The other reviews I have read have said that the pool at times doesn't look that clean, this is correct, it could definatly do with painting,there is a lot of paint is peeling away and the water does look like it has a lot of sun cream in it, although they do their best to keep rubbish, leaves etc out of it. We were told this year the hotel is being refurbished in November, so hopefully this will be attended to. The steak house is lovely and the food is amazing, we had our wedding reception meal there, there was a lot of effort put in, the tables were specially decorated with white tables cloths, candles, rose petals, it really nice and it felt very special. The Main restaurant is also lovely and caters for all tastes, the BBQ they put of is really good and also the Theme nights make a nice change. We were very worried about the beach, we had seen it in 2006 when there were not any sandbags and it had blown us away, we were concerned as the pictures we had seen worried us. It does spoil the beach compared to what it was like before, but it certainly did not spoil our holiday and infact we spent most of our time there. The only thing I would say is that at times the sea was very rough and I felt quite dangerous on one day the life guards wouldnt let anyone in, we also witnessed a life guard rescue a couple that seemed to be stuck behind one of the sandbags, as the undercurrent is strong, not suitable for young children. Our wedding was brilliant and hassle free,I had not been able to find much on the internet about other peoples weddings their, which is quite suprising as there are weddings going on most days, we had a meeting with the wedding coordinator the day after we arrived and then 4 days later we got married in the gardens of the Tequila. We were blown away by how amazing the day went, the ceremony was very private and very romantic, much of our wedding party were teary eyed as the wedding was so beautiful. It was firstly in spanish and then translated into english, we then had photos taken in the grounds and on the beach, we were really pleased with out photos that were taken by the hotels photographer, he was a really nice guy, very relaxed and professional, we were very worried about the quality of the photos before, but they exceeded our expectations, they are beautiful, we loved them so much we ended up buying 24 extra photos, plus a disc with all photos taken, the wedding coordinator had then arranged for a small cocktail party near the bar in reception, whilst we waited for our meal. We ate our meal, made speeches and cut our cake. We could not have asked for a better day, we were soo pleased.

I believe the hotel is due for a refurb in August and it is probably about time as the shower in ours did have a lot of damp on the ceiling. Premises That said we had a lovely time at the hotel. The premises were kept clean and tidy and the staff were all friendly. The food was great and varied each evening. If you want to book for either of the restaurants you need to get up extremely early as the tables were all taken by 7.00 am. Pool & Entertainment The pool was great. Being a non-swimmer I was afraid some of the pool would be out of my depth but I could walk all the way through it. The swim up bar was excellent. Julio and Veronica would see you coming and have the drinks ready for you when you got to the bar . . . watch out for Veronica with the soda siphon! If you wanted it there was plenty to do in the day with water polo, shooting, boules etc. There was entertainment every evening aand although the staff worked very hard this wasnt our cup of tea I'm afraid. It consisted mainly of the dancing and miming to various show tunes. The beach was a short walk away and I found this rather of a disappointment as to hold back the sand there were giant sand bags in place which spoilt the view. Sights We booked our trips at the first booth near the shops just down from the hotel and they were a lot cheaper than booking through Thomsons. Ask for Pedro he was very good and very informative. We visited Chichen Itza, Tulum, Xal-ha and went to the Captain Cook evening in Cancun, all of which we highly recommend. Wear a hat and plenty of sun cream and mosquito spray for Chichen Itza and Tulum. It was very hot and hardly any shade. The ruins were fantastic and the beach at Tulum was beautiful.

The grounds are well kept and very clean. We tipped our maid $1.00/per day and our room was spotless every day. Our room had a cot, which is a good idea for families with teenagers. The beds were a little small, but we had no complaints. Our bar was stocked every 2 days with all the required beverages from pop, water and beer. The room had a big ceiling fan which circulated the air-conditioning well. Our room was always cool. The pool was beautiful! The bartenders at the pool bar were excellent! The buffets were also good especially the pizza. It was made with homemade dough every day. My whole family loved it! Lots of different food to choose from. We did not get sick of it. We just chose different foods every day, but always had the pizza and coconut ice cream. The highlight of our trip was the entertainment staff! If it wasn't for this hard working group of people the hotel would be boring. They had you up playing volleyball, water polo, horseshoes, bocchi, ping-pong, shuffle board and darts. There was always something to do everyday from 10-12noon and from 3-5PM. They also have a kid's club for younger children from maybe 3-10yrs old. They look like they are always having a great time. It is an extremely safe resort! You can leave your kids with the entertainment staff most of the day and not worry a bit. It was like my husband and I had a separate holiday from our kids aged 12 & 14. You have a show every night at 9:30-10:30. Each night is a different show. I would have to say they were all good. Some were better than others. The Grease Show and the Michael Jackson shows were the best!!!! There is also a sports bar with games to play for both kids and adults. The games in here you have to pay for. There are also computers to use for a price as well. There are many tours to take. We loved the ATV's in the jungle. That was the best!

Overall it's a nice hotel. The staff is very friendly. And the grounds and rooms are very clean. The room decor and furniture is in dire need of updating. But, the room was spotless. I have to mention, however, that the beds are very, very firm. I read about this in earlier reviews but did not pay it much attention. I think it's necessary to repeat, however. My sister acknowledged that the bed was firm, but she did not seem to have a problem with it. So, it's a personal preference. The pools were always crowded and seemed like fun. We spent most of our time at the beach. The beach is about 5 minutes away. It's a very nice walk. If you're not a walker, they have a cart that takes you to and from the beach every few minutes. The beach is pretty nice. The water is very blue. It can get rough, however. We never had a problem with finding beach chairs. Someone did steal our towel, though. The hotel makes you pay if you don't return the same number of towels that you borrowed! Luckily, the woman working the towel hut was kind enough to let it slide and did not charge us. Why someone would want to steal a wet, used towel is a mystery to me. But, it is what it is. The food was pretty good considering that it's an all inclusive resort and they are cooking such large amounts of food. The buffet was not bad. The choice was pretty varied. We ate at the steakhouse one evening. That was good as well. Not excellent. But, good. The lobby bar is very good. The bartenders made very good drinks. I should also note that there is no beverage service at the beach. If you want drinks you have to walk to the pool bar. We also went to the spa and had Swedish massages. Very relaxing and nice. The massage was only $64! That's pretty inexpensive. And, it was good. Overall, it was a good hotel and I had a very good and relaxing time.

The hotel is clean, well maintained and welcoming. The property has two pools with the restaurant between them and one has a pool bar. The rooms are clean but the colour choice is a little off (mint green) but otherwise they are spacious and they take the time to make little towel animals which my daughter liked. The grounds of the hotel are very lush with trees and plants and clean. There are all sorts of native critters running around which everyone got a kick at watching. If you are beach person this is not the area to visit. All along the immediate area there are these huge sand bags on the beach (which in first view I thought was dead whales) to prevent the tide taking any more sand away. I'm not a beach person but I was disappointed that you couldn't walk the beach without climbing over these huge bags. I have no idea how far they went either way on the beach but it was as far as the eye could see both ways. We asked quite a few people why these bags were on the beach and got all sorts of different answers. If you go into Playa Del Carmen you don\u2019t see any sand bags at the beach and it is just beautiful. The kids club is okay and if your child is under 6 I wouldn't recommend leaving them. I took my daughter one day to check out the program and witnessed children wondering away from the staff into a small pool. While these children appeared to be able to swim it took the staff too long to react that these children walked away. The food at this hotel is very good. I rarely eat meat at these resorts and this time I though I would try some and I was glad I did! There is lots of variety and different options. The Buffet was always different and plenty to choose from. The only thing that really bothered me is trying to book the ala carte at 7:30 in the morning and being told that the 7pm is full.

The Mexican food at the Beach Club was really good, and there we had a great ocean view as we ate. Otherwise the buffet had a lot of the same food, but if you vary your choices each day it wasn't bad. I have a huge sweet tooth and was not overly impressed with any of the desserts. The room was a little musty, but based on a review I read on traveling in that area, I brought a bottle of air deodorizer. A couple of sprays and the room was fine for a couple days.

Unfortunately, this hotel is being closed for 3 months shortly for a refurbishment which, unluckily for us, is well overdue! We spoke to other people who were return visitors to the Tequila and they said it had really gone downhill as it used to be excellent! The rooms looked very tired and the towels were tatty! Our maid was called Leticia and she did her level best to keep her room clean but because it was so shabby, it made everything seem unclean. The pool desperatey needed an update and as previously mentioned, the whirlpools were not working correctly. Somebody also vomited in the pool after having one too many at the poolside bar and nothing seemed to be done to rectify this! We went on the Cancun bar crawl on a Monday night and booked through Thomson. This was a good trip until we arrived at Coco Bongo, queued for ages and it was dangerously overcrowded once inside. We felt like we were being crushed and we witnessed a girl panicking and terrified as she was being crushed at the front and behind by people trying to move forward. My partner tried to complain to the Thomson reps that people were being crushed and they said that it was best to go on a Wednesday as Monday's were notoriously crowded. However, Emma, the rep at the Tequila failed to mention this when she took our money! There were two reps, Wendy and Emma, who seemed quite fed up most of the time. We asked Emma to tell us about the Cancun Bar Crawl and she resignedly told us about it, looking slightly irritated. I also heard Wendy speaking to somebody on the phone saying \"Am I ok? I would be if I wasn't at work\"! A member of Riu staff from reception came over to ask Wendy a question and Wendy spoke down to her in an awful manner in front of all three of us which we all noticed. The toilets at the Beach Club had a strong sewerage smell during our whole stay and this was exasperated by the fact that they were right next to the lunchtime buffet! However, we did find the food very good both in the buffet restaurant and in the steak restaurant. The staff in the restaurants were excellent and so friendly. We tried the mexican at the Riu Yucatan but this was awful. Unfortunately I suffered a bout of food poisoning on the second day, but I quickly recovered after 24 hours in bed! We had a day and a half of rain, which wasn't too bad given that this is officially their rainy season. The rest of the time it was sunny. Good points were the staff, they were brilliant. The waiters and the Animation Team were excellent. The beach was lovely, white sand and turqoise sea. They are trying to pump sand in behind the sand bags to build the beach back up but on two occasions two large amounts of sand washed away from where they were, so this seems futile.

We booked this with Portland and there were 4 adults in the party. We have been Riu converts for a number of years now. Ensure that you sign up for a Riu class card before you go away and you can collect points for your stay and then use them in the furture to upgrade and obtain discounts. Flight - Fantastic!!!!! We upgraded to Premier at time of booking and then paid the extra \u00a310 each way per person to sit together. (Glad we did as a lot of couples were very upset at having to be separated in the premier cabin) The overall experience on the flight out was great, the cabin crew could not have been more helpful and kept us all well lubricated. The flight back was great too and the food was palatable , not to mention the extra leg room and comfy seats which were most welcome on the night flight back. Check-In - Speedy service from the airport to the hotel, only one drop off before ours to the Princess Hotel in the Riveria Maya. There is a strange button that you have to press on entrance to Mexico at immigrations, green and you can go through. Red and your case will be searched, it is completely randon and was glad I didnt have to have mine searched as the case only just about shut!!!!!! Express check-in at the hotel, collect your keys and safe lock and away you go. You can fill out the forms for the hotel in your room and check in the next day which is better. In true Riu style your cases are brought up to your room, we tipped them 2 dollars per bag. You are greeted with a glass of refreshing naranjer. We requested 2nd floor rooms in a quiet block as it can get noisy nearer to the reception and sports bar. I sent an email to the hotel and as usual they accomodated this. Rooms - Very bright and very Mexican!!!!!! Brightly decorated with ample room and a balcony with an airer. There is a dressing room area with a concealed toilet and an open shower cubicle. For more privacy you can close the curtain for the dressing room . You also have a fridge with soft drinks and beer (you need to request diet coke and canada dry ginger ale from reception). You have optics for white rum, whiskey, brandy and vodka. The wardrobe is nice and big with an iron and ironing board and an antique safe (but it works). They also provide you with a complimentary umbrella (more on that later). I would recommend keeping your light off at night whilst using the toilet as bugs can come through the vent when the light is on. I would recommend taking a mosquito plug in. Beds comfy and the bed linen was changed every day. Armin our maid was fantastic and he made the best towel animals of all the Riu's we have stayed at. We asked for extra pillows and he provided them for us and kept our rooms spick and span. Weather - I am glad that we were provided with an umbrella, out of 14 days it rained on 12 of them!!!! It was still very warm and a good excuse to stay in the pool!!!!! Like true Brits we sheltered under the sun shades and made great use of the brollies as wind breaks. The downside was that the pool bar flooded as the roof did not hold up to the amount of rain they were having and that was the only place to eat during the day if you stayed in at the Riu Tequila. They did eventually open up the restaurant but that meant the pool restaurant could only serve chips and burgers as they had limited staff. Pool - it does need to be repainted as all the paint is chipping off the bottom, the lights are taped on and the filters are now not working so there is always a thin layer of flies and leaves on the surface. The 2 pool guys do try their best and they were in the pool each morning cleaning the tiles and walking round all day with a net trying to catch all the leaves that had fallen in the pool. You could always get a bed round the pool, no problems!!!!!! Steak House - Fantastic, only 2 sitting either 7pm or 9pm. Unfortunately if there has been rain during the day then it was slightly damp at night. The food was fantastic and you got ceasar salad and finger food to start, then soup (it was fab!!!), then steak, chicken etc followed by Bella Alaska (sponge and ice cream). This was housed in the pool restaurant. Restaurant/Food - The food was very poor, lack of choice and as there was a vege in our party, there was limited food as quite a few vege options contained ham!!!! (work that one out). The food is very repetitive and regurgated from left overs from lunch. The food labels didnt match up to the foods on display and they ran out of food very quickly. The barbeque, chef was stingy only allowing one small cut of meat per person. Waiters very slow to clear tables unless the manager appeared and then it was super efficient service!!!!!!! If they spent as much time over the food as they did on the ice sculptures and the fruit displays then this would be A+. Bars - Swim up bar is the best!!!!!! Great drinks, and great service!!!!!! The pumps for soft drinks at the kiosk, sports bar and bar next to the stage didnt work for over a week so all coke and 7up etc was flat. The Pepsi man only visits once a week apparently. The chocolate Martini's are fabulous!!!!! The bars did get very packed when it rained and there was limited seating as most of it is outside!!!!!!!!! Animation team - they worked very hard 10.30am to 10.30pm entertaining everyone and trying to adapt the entertainment to suit the needs of the weather. The bingo is a must!!!!!!!!!! The Michael Jackson show is great too!!!!!! Tulum - visited Tulum, great half a day, guide was very informative. XCaret - Fantastic, definately worth a visit only $14 in a taxi. You can get tickets from your holiday rep. We recommend upgrading to the plus package as you get drinks, lunch, towels, snorkel equipment and lockers. The river snorkel is fantastic, you leave your belongings in a locked bag and it is taken down to the river exit for you to collect once you have completed the snorkel. There are exits along the river in case you get tired or fed up with it. You then exit at the beach. The skyviewer is worth a visit although it is tucked a little off the beaten path. Platinuim Cruise - You are better opting to go on the dolphin discovery excursion as you only spend 20 minutes each way on the cruise to Las Mujeres. Then you have an allocated time to swim with the dolphins and you then have to try and fit in all the other activities around that time, which is impossible. We managed snorkelling at Garrafon National Park and the dolphins. The dolphin royal swim is definately worth it!!!!!!! I was a bit disappointed with the hotel for allowing Calaypso Photography to come into the hotel each day with a different animal, toucan, monkey, parrot, iguana etc...... So that the guests could have photo's taken with these animals and they went round all the hotels. You could then buy the photos in the evening. Not very natural for the animals. All in all an ok-ish holiday, not to Riu's usual standard but should be better once it has had a face lift!!!!!!!

A lot of friends recommended staying in Mayan Riveria and the Riu chain was the way to go. We heard a lot of good reviews from friends for the Tequila hotel specifically so we gave it a shot. We went in the second last week of May for a week. The hotel is beautifully decorated. The hotel grounds, rooms and restaurants are very clean. The staff are amazing. They work really hard and they do a really good job. They are extremely friendly and helpful. I was amazed at the variety of food that was offered for every meal. I looked forward to breakfast everyday and the different dinner themes. The food was really good. The dining hall is beautiful. The only thing I wish we knew a head of time was that during dinner, guys could not wear sleeveless tops (tank tops). My husband brought mostly tank tops and luckily had two shirts on hand so he had to go change his top. We were surprised but it wasn't a big deal, it should have been mentioned to us when we checked in rather then at the restaurant. I guess they were trying to make the dinner a little less casual than breakfast and lunch, (that's when I noticed that the dinner staff wore full suits with ties...I don't know how they can wear that in the heat and work) but it made the setting look elegant. It was actually quite nice in the end because it gave me an excuse to dress up a little more in the evening (like a nice sun dress, rather then just tank top and shorts), then you can go watch the entertainment for the evening and go straight to the hotel disco afterwards. You can really spend your entire trip at the resort and have a good time. The walk to the beach is very nice. I was looking forward to the beach but was a little dissapointed that the water was too rough to swim in. You can still stand in the water and play a bit but that's about it. Despite the roughness of the water, the view of it beach and is sooo pretty to look at. The water is so blue and clear. The sand is so soft and powdery. Sitting under the palm trees by the beach is just incredible and worth the trip. If you want to go snokelling (like we did) you'll have to find a snokelling park to swim in. Akumal was a really good park to see fish, cab ride from the hotel was about 35 mins away. I would recommend staying in the lagoon when snokeling rather than wandering off because the water can get rough elsewhere. We did a combo excursion where we saw the Tulum Ruins (very pretty) and then went to Xel-ha. I highly recommend Xel-ha for those who like to snorkel. The park admission fee was quite high but I would still go back. However, if I go back, I would go really early in the morning and spend all day there. The park is only open until 6pm and there is a ton of water activies to do. Trip to downtown (5th ave.) Playa del Carmen by taxi is about 5 mins away. It's a fun place to explore and walk around but I highly recommend going later in the day for those who can't really take the heat. It can get really hot during the day. Overall, the trip was a lot of fun. We would definitely go back to Mexico and can't imagine staying anywhere else. Just a little note about US Airways at the Buffalo New York Airport. Try to arrive no later than two hours before your flight if you ever have to fly out of the Buffalo New York airport or else the staff will constantly complain and give you a hard time about you arriving late. A lot of people missed their plane because they wouldn't let them on when it was 45min prior to lift off. Just checking in alone was extremely slow. I've been on many trips from many airlines and this just took the cake. The location of the self check kiosk was in a very bad location (right in front of the check in staff) so every one thought you had to line up for them when you didn't. All the other airlines place their kiosk on the side for \"express self check-in.\" The experience of checking in alone was just terrible.

We have never stayed at a Riu or all inclusive before and all I can say was that it exceeded our expectations. We did not want to return home and can't wait to book to go again. I did have some reservations after reading other reviews but I would not agree at all with the few negative comments that have been made. The beach has been eroded but it is still beautiful and I could not belive how blue the sea was and how soft the sand was, it took your breath away! The sea is a bit rough and not very safe for small kids to go swimming in, but it is fun in the waves and there are other safer beaches to go (Akumal beach is worth a trip, about 20 mins in a taxi, very safe for kids, nice beach bar and fantastic glass bottom boat trip - only $20 dollars each for adults and you get to see turtles, loads of big and small fish, well worth doing). Would love to have done more trips but only got around to doing XCARET and the Pirate lobster dinner - both brilliant and worth every $, we all enjoyed them both (son only 4 yrs). Went to Cancun on the bus which was really cheap to do and went to some of the shopping malls - ok but preferred the small shops in 5th Av only 5 mins from the hotel in Playa del Carmen and $5 in a taxi. Had a nice meal there and good to walk around all the shops and bars at night. The food - what can I say, it was fab! Loads of choice and changes each night with theme nights etc. You can eat and drink all day if you wanted to! There was everything you could think of and it was delicious, we have certainly but on a few pounds!! Eat at the 2 restaurants that you have to book, steak house and mexican and both were lovely. The buffets were definately nicer at Tequila than Playacar and Yucatan, although nice to go there if you want a change. The beach is only a pleasant five min walk under a covered walkway, although the buggy goes for those feeling too lazy but we preferred to walk off some of the food we had just eaten! I think we definately made the right choice as although others reviwers have mentioned that Tequila needs a lick of paint in some areas (due for refurb in Aug), we felt it was much nicer than the Playacar and Yucatan. The staff are all so friendly and cheerful, there is a great atmosphere. Our room was spacious and nice and we didn't see why other reviewers had complained so much about them. The shower ceiling needed a paint but that was all, everywhere was extremely clean and the towel animals left on the bed made our son's day. The whole hotel was kept clean continously and the grounds were lovely (the wildlife was fascinating to watch). The staff all work so hard and the entertainment was very good, all the kids loved their mini disco and games etc each night at 8.30pm. The various shows then start at 9.30pm and are well worth watching. If you are thinking of booking don't hesitate.

Flew from Birmingham which had to make a stop in Manchester to refeul which was a bit of a hassle but your on hols so I wouldnt let that spoil it. The stop was for about 1 1/2 hrs and they also changed staff. You could not get a drink until they took off again which was a bit annoying. The flight wasnt to bad it was good that you had tvs in ur head rest. The meal was ok eatable but my only prob was the bar service you didnt get a drink for ages and they didnt come round much. No delays which was good. When we arrived at the Tequila we were greeted with a cocktail & then given our key and the bell boy brought our luggage too our room. Everything looked lovely really clean you could tell it was well looked after. When we got to our room it looked ok not as bad as some people made out. They were clean a bit jazzy but u r in Mexico. They all getting done up so it will be nice to see what there like next yr. When we got to our room there was a bottle of champagne & a fruit basket and balloons it looked lovely. I had told them it was our 10 yr anv so that was a nice thought. Our rooms looked over the golf course and it got the sun in the evenings which was great. And the mini bar & optics in the room were great. The pools lovely and the swim up bar is great spend a lot of time there. Loved the Banna Mamas with extra rum they were good. The bar staff are great so quick at making you a drink it was great. They used to say happy hr and give you extra. Never tasted nicer hotel food in my life so much choice to much choice. The burgers were lovely proper home made everything you could ask for they had loved the bbq's they were great . There was everything you could ask for and more. Loved the omeletts in the morn. Our hotel def had the best food had lunch at the Yucatan and was not great even there burgers were not home made. Even no the Tequila isnt on the beach its def the nicest and had great staff. The beach isnt as bad as everybody makes out it has sandbags and its not as big as it used to be but it is still nice. Went out on the quad bags into the jungle which was great drove straight from the hotel & then we had a stop & went swimming in a cave great fun. Also went out on the Fat Cat which was a good day out a nice & relaxing trip you get a lunch & free drink. Went on the spreed boats only 12 people allowed on them they were really quick we sat at the front & got completly soaked you had 2 hold tight cause you didnt want to go in.

We were there between 24th September - 9th October 2004 and I can honestly say it was a holiday of a lifetime. I could write a book about my holiday there as I enjoyed it so much, but here is a summary for you. Any specific questions please email me! FLIGHT & TRANSFERS - Flew from London Gatwick (UK) to Cancun Airport. Flight time was approx 10 hours, pretty boring but well worth it when we got there. Flew with My Travel in Premiair Gold. WEATHER - Overall the weather during our stay was very good, some tropical rain showers, but they only lasted 2-3 minutes and were few and far between which was fine. RIU TEQUILA HOTEL - Superb, it was the first time I had used the Riu chain and I enjoyed it so much I was even going to go back for my honeymoon in 2006, until plans changed! Rooms, food, drinks, staff, cleanliness, service and even the entertainment team were all superb! An added bonus is you can use all of the restaurants, bars and facilities of the neighbouring Riu Playacar and Riu Yucatan. There were two pools in the Tequila site and these were separated by a lovely pool bar. PLAYACAR - (Playa Del Carmen) - It is a new, purpose built resort but it is nevertheless a beautiful place. Every hotel is near to the beach and there is Mexican street nearby to Riu hotel which is nice for shopping. More shopping is available on \"Fifth Avenue\" which from the Riu Tequila is $4.00 (designer shops etc.) Fifth is also where you can catch a ferry to Cozumel (approx $18 pp) TRIPS - There are so many trips and activities you can do in the area and the surrounding areas, but here is a breakdown of the ones we went on. 1) CAPTAIN HOOK'S ADVENTURES, CANCUN - Just over one hour on an air conditioned coach (which sold drinks) and we were in Cancun and ready to board the Pirate Ship for an evening of entertainment. Approx $76.00 pp with a steak meal (which was SUPERB!) - In fact probably one of the best meals I had in Mexico) the trip lasts 3-4 hours and is all inclusive with drinks. Party games, disco and general fun. Look out for the \"battle\" when another Pirate Ship joins you on the Caribbean Sea for a \"duel\" - 10/10 2) TULUM (MAYAN RUINS) - Well worth a visit for some \"Mexican History\" - around $20.00 pp (with tour guide) - start out on a coach (air con) and stop off and try some \"FRESH\" Tequila (Burns the hairs off your feet!!) and then on to the Mayan ruins. They are beautiful but I\u2019ll pre-warn you it is HOT HOT HOT there as there is very little shade. - 8/10 (The overwhelming heat spoiled it for me) 3) XEL-HA - A spectacular Eco-park around 20 mins by coach from Playacar. We spent half a day there as part of the Tulum trip but it works out around $30.00 pp. There are lots of activities including, snorkelling (eqpt provided), lazy river, cliff jumping and swimming with dolphins (extra charge) A great place (spent most of the day snorkelling - rays and Parrot fish being favourites) - 10/10 4) SENOR FROGS - Another evening trip which included a brief but informative tour of the Playa del Carmen main town. Senor Frogs is a US Themed Party bar and is full of fun and games! Look out for the \"Yard Glasses\" and some of the cocktails blow your socks off!!! - 10/10 5) DOLPHIN DISCOVERY - Swimming with Dolphins - approx $125.00 per person. THE BEST THING I HAVE EVER DONE! Amazing - if you go you MUST do this. DVD available after for around $50.00 and I have watched this a dozen times in the week or so I have been back. (www.dolphindiscovery.com) - 11/10 6) CAPTAIN RICK'S DEEP SEA FISHING - $87.00 pp for 4 hours (all tackle, bait and beverages provided) 4 hours, 5 barracuda, topped off by mine at 35lb! Excellent! 10/10 7) FAT CAT - Catamaran tour - approx $90.00 for the day, food and drink included. Kimba, a 4 year old boxer dog is the captain of this fun filled catamaran. It takes you out to a beautiful deserted island for some snorkelling (led by Kimba) and then to one of natures wonders, a freshwater lagoon, the freshwater meets with the sea water and the temperatures are really amazing, water is hot and cold at the same time (words don't really explain it!) and then back to the marina via the eccentric Brit who built his own island out of 300,000 coca-cola bottles!!!!! Great day out - 10/10 I have covered most things, but as I said I could turn this into a book. I would recommend the resort and the Riu Tequila to anyone and everyone!

The whole holiday was fantastic, the flights were on time and comfortable, the transfer to the hotel was great,altho a slight delay due to a lady who's luggage was lost. The rep was great too and explained the whole checking in process to us. Upon arrival at the hotel, we were welcomed with a drink and the keys and towel cards and safe key, the luggage was bought to our room and the staff were friendly and helpful from the start, even remembering some guests from thier last visit. The hotel rooms were immaculate, and the beds were not as hard as some reviews made them out to be, we had a stocked frindge and mini bar and the air con worked fine too. Cannot say a bad word about the food, every day there was lots of choice for lunch...and at tea time, you could not go wrong,there is food to suit everyone and the waiting staff were always there to help you get seated and a drink too. The staff at the Riu hotels work so so hard, they always had a smile on their face and were always entertaining, the shows they put on were great too, especially the crazy show and a must see is the micheal jackson show ! The resort is lovely, you can use any Riu hotel and they all different things to offer, the pool bars are fab and the staff there certainly dont let you sit there without a drinks...try the kamakaze's and the boom booms ! The pool itself if clean and the staff make sure this is maintained. There are 2 pools, one being slightly noiser than the other so you do have a choice. It was not that difficult to get a sun bed either, we tended to go to the beach in the morning, by the time we went to the pool, there were sun beds free. The beach is lovely, sometimes the waves were a bit to rough but enough for you to paddle your feet in and the view was still nice, although i belive it is a shame that some of the beach was eroded due to the hurricane, i did hear that the beach will be put back to it glory soon though and you can see they are doing all they can to rectify this, however, it did not spoil it for me too much. The wedding went without a hitch, it all went as planned and the beach setting was glorious ! the wedding itself was taken place at the Palace hotel and the grounds there are breathtaking ! and aso are the photos, you will be spoilt for choice of picture opportunities ! The steakhouse in the Tequila is great too, the waiting staff are very helpful and the food was cooked to your liking. The plaza is also good to have a look around and grab some bargains, although a trip into Playa is reccomended, there are some fabulous shop and spoilt for choice with the silver on offer, be prepared to haggle though ! We went on a few excursions, one being the Dolphin Discovery, if like me , you love dolphins and have never been, this trip is a must ! one of the best experiences of my life ! A group of us also went on the night out clubbing to Cancun...this was also very well organised and a good laugh too with a brilliant atmosphere. The other trip we went on was the quad bking , through the jungle , you get taken to a cave and a cenote and a private beach, great if you like a buzz and to see other parts to Playa. My advice is, to make sure you shop around for prices, as some kiosk's will charge you more than others for the trips. The walk from the Tequila to the beach at the Yuacatan is literally a few minutes walk, its a lovely walk way , other than that, there is a regular buggy to and from the hotel to the beach. The weather was fantastic too, only one day with bad rain, but it cleared the air up nicely. The sports bar was definatly a hit too...its open 24 hours a day and serves hot and cold drinks and snaks too. Overall , this holiday was brilliant, i would definatly go back there again and most definatley stay in another Riu hotel. Of course, the holiday as most holidays are made more special by the people you go with and the people you meet, and i couldnt have asked for better.", "Date": "May 9, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Suffolk", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel, dubious Thomson staff\u201d", "Author": "ScouserSuffolk", "ReviewID": "UR15771438", "Content": "This is a great hotel and the staff cannot do enough for you to make your stay comfortable.

We left the following day for the airport accompanied by the reps Abbi and Emma. At the airport they got off the coach and the supervisor for Thomson got on the coach and told us we would not be flying straight to Gatwick, but via Dominican Republic. She stated that they had only just found this out which was hard to believe. We flew to DR with a Manchester crew and changed to a Gatwick crew and lo and behold collected ten more passengers who had been bumped off their DR flight because Thomson had over booked their flight. They were paid 600 Euros to get on our flight. The whole thing reeked of deception and when I pointed this out to the supervisor on the flight she denied that we were being made scapegoats for Thomsons poor planning and incompetence. The captain stated that the plane had a fault with an air conditioning part, which along with the crew change, caused the delay. The whole thing smacked of deception and I have noted some of the previous reviews about Thomson and can say that if you buy the trips from the reps you're their best mates, but after that you can forget it. When I got back to work I discovered that friends had used Thomson to go to the Caribbean from Gatwick a few days after we arrived in Mexico and were delayed. Yes you guessed it, they were delayed by a fault on the air conditioning on their aircraft. Coincidence or dishonesty, make your own mind up.

The Cancun nightclub crawl was also a well worth while night, going to numerous bars and clubs including the famous COCO BONGO club where the Mask was filmed.

Staff was great. Location is good enough, but it IS a 30 minutes walk to the city. Beach a walkable distance and in the shade, or a fun cart ride if you want to wait for it. The beach is great for this area. There's a good 40 meters with no sand bag right in front of where you arrive. We never had trouble getting a chair even midday. It was end of April, though. The pool is nothing special, but it seems to have enough chairs. The in-pool bar is a mess, as it is probably in many other resorts. At least the pool is divided in two, with the bar on only one side. The food is what this place is all about. I never expected so much quality in that area. We went once to each of the two a la carte and didn't bother making other reservations as there was just so much great stuff to try in the buffet. I have to give food a rating of 6/5 because we couldn't even try everything in the buffet. I never understood how people could stuff themselves on french fries. I would return to this hotel if only for the food. They had themes every night for the buffet. Somehow unfortunately, we went on too many day trips to fully enjoy the resort. The few drinks we had seemed generous enough on alcohol. We didn't go to the club. Unfortunately our room was in a very passing area and it's not soundproof at all. But I assume this is the norm. Luckily I had brought my good and trusty ear plugs. The rooms are nothing special size and decor wise but are otherwise very clean, so it was fine by us.

The shows at night are brilliant and well worth watching my only small complaint is that theres not much to do after 11pm if you have children.

The room doors were paper thin, so you could hear even the slightest noise in the hallway, and therefore we were routinely woken up in the night. Beds were hard (even by Mexico standards), and covered with a hot, sticky, plastic liner that made them even worse. Pillows were stiff and hard too. Room water is non-potable. Paint was slopped onto fixtures, there was dirt build-up in corners, crevices ventilation grilles. One of the bedspreads was frayed and worn. The Riu is a study in how to make a room that looks initially attractive into a torture chamber. Safe and room (stamped with the room number) had physical keys that you had to keep track of, along with towel cards . Do you really want a brass key stamped with your room number with you at the beach? The balcony door had no provision for locking. With these failures of even basic security, I bet they have a lot of rapes. I didn't like having to tote keys around with me and found the towel cards to be juvenile and insulting, as well as one more thing to keep track of. Snorkel equipment was available for only up to one hour per day, but no matter, nothing to snorkel for there anyway. If you make the walk to the beach (shuttle has limited hours), you will be treated to the hideous erosion control features that are everywhere and a sterile sea floor with very few fish. Food and drink are plentiful. Drink quality is fair. Food quality is school cafeteria level or lower. Foods are served buffet style. Great variety, but generally breads will be stale, fruit unripe, and hot foods poorly executed. Even so called \"Show cooking\" which was prepared fresh in front of your eyes was of poor quality. Hotdogs were bland and tasted of filler. Hamburgers were nearly inedible. Scrambled eggs were often raw and runny. Cheese selections were usually nice. Plan on spending a lot of time searching for things. Butter won't be near breads, chips won't be near guacamole or salsas, etc. Dining facilities are good looking and well decorated with ice sculptures, carved fresh fruits and flowers. The off beach location contributes to the heat and humidity, and makes this place physically uncomfortable. I suspect too the expansive grounds, which are heavily watered add to the humidity problem. We were generally miserable out of doors, except in the early morning or at the beach. To contrast we also spent time on Cozumel on the water on this trip, and thoroughly enjoyed being outdoors, and the water. The Riu Tequila is frequented by guests of European origin. You will see some female topless sunbathing. Pools were moderately crowded even though this was the off season. We saw cigarette butts and evidence of spilled drinks in the water.

The relaxing part was easy to do, as I was by the pool or on the beach most of the time that I was there, however the size of the hotel and the number of people staying there made it difficult to meet people and see them again the next day. Personally I did not like staying in a resort that large, many of the other resorts that I have stayed in have been much smaller, and I prefer them to the size of this hotel. There were just too many people. It was hard to get a decent seat to watch the shows at night, and was difficult to get a chair by the pool, and even the beach sometimes. I did however really enjoy the food, I think I ate about 7 times a day, there was always food available and it was very good. My room was very clean and was very quiet at night. The beds however were extremely HARD, and very uncomfortable. The pool was very large, however with the amount of people there, even at 8 in the morning most of the chairs already had peoples things on them, so was very difficult to get a chair in a decent location. The beach was very nice, they are trying to restore it with large sand bags to keep the sand in, but it was very very nice. Only 2 of the days was the beach closed because of the wind and the waves (well it wasn't really closed, but the life guard wouldn't let you go far out, which I don't blame him because the water tow was incredibly strong and anyone could have easily drown or be taken out - as it was I saw one guy almost drown because he couldn't get out of the water - but he finally did get out) I found that the entertainment was mediocre for a 5 star resort, of the 7 nights that I was there 2 of them were shows that included the audience and not the entertainment staff, and when there were shows I did not find them to be up to the standards that should be a 5 star resort. I have stayed in 3 star hotels that had better evening shows than this hotel. I did find the staff very friendly and super helpful, they made my stay very good. And because of the size of the hotel I was not bothered by the entertainment staff during the day when I was by the pool as much as I have been bothered in other hotels and locations. I went on 2 tours when I was there, one to Ek Balam, which are ancient Mayan Ruins, and the day trip was incredible, our tour guide was incredibly knowledgeable and was very nice. I also went snorkeling in Cozumel with Scuba Caribe, this was a very nice day trip, however found that it was a little disorganized and wish that the water was not so rough that day as swimming in those swells made me feel very ill. Overall the hotel was very nice and very clean, the staff were great and the service was incredible.

We did the dolphin swim at Dolphin Discovery which was about \u00a3100 each but well worth it, you can buy the DVD and photos of you swim too. We also went to Chi chen itza which was my favourite. Its about a 3 hour drive but the coach is air conditioned and the tour guides are fab it doesnt feel like it takes that long. One tip for this trip though, even if it doesnt look like it is going to rain take the umbrella provided in your room, there is not a lot of shade here and it gets very hot! We also went to xcaret which is fab, dont listen to the reps when they tell you to go midday as there is loads to do there it opens at 10 and takes about 10 mins in tax to get to.

We departed from Manchester on the 18th March for Two weeks and I have to say I would never ever go to Mexico again while the American are on Spring Break. We stayed at this hotel in July/August 2006 and we had such a wonderful holiday we decided to return. As I say the mistake we made was returning at Easter time. The hotel was over run with American youths coming from the other Riu's (playacar, Yucatan) to go to the disco at the Riu Tequila. Each night around 9:00 ish they would arrive in droves. If you sat in the reception, which is really beautiful, it looked as if a football match or factory had just finished and let out as the mass came towards us. I have never seen such badly behaved youths. I spoke to our rep about it and it was said that the whole six-week spring break was always the same and if we thought this was bad you should see Cancun!!! Every night they would land shouting and screaming, they were unable to arrive without letting the whole hotel know they had arrived. The language was disgusting. It was obvious they had already had enough to drink but the first thing they would do is stock up with the shots. I have to say that a lot of these kids did not look old enough to drink but they were obviously used to it because of the amount they could consume before the sickness/collapse, which surprised us because you cannot drink in the USA until you are 21. We had to put up with them invading the evening shows whilst the entertainment team tried to get them off stage and control them. We saw girls being carried out, too drunk to walk. We also saw a boy being sick in the reception and his father took him outside but never even informed the staff or made any attempt to have the vomit cleaned. We had our 14-year-old son with us and we were worried what impact this would all have on him and swiftly got him out of the way to our room when it was really wild. Definitely not a suitable environment for children. The rep told us that these youths where there with their parents and that they could not stop it because they booked as families and not groups of young all male or all female parties. If you stay in this area you can use the facilities in any of the Riu hotels accept for the Palace. We did go to the beach and decided to have lunch at the Yucatan, which was also a big mistake. Rude, these people have no idea what queuing means they just walk in front and are just as loud at lunch as they are in the evening. Its as if they need to draw attention to themselves all the time, as to who could be the loudest big mouth. My husband said he never wants to hear another American accent as long as he lives. Pool and swim up bar - You had to be up before 6am to get a bed although the staff would get more beds out and find you a space somewhere if you arrived late. I did get up early one morning and got beds but within an hour the Americans had got beds from other areas and invaded. They just got beds and put them in front of you and right up to the edge of the pool, so many, that we could not get near the pool to get into the water without walking around to find a gap. The swim up bar was fab if only we did not have the usual shouting of \"Buddy the drinks are on me\" and of course they do not know what queue means. We also discovered that people were paying the staff to get beds for them to save them getting up. Food- The food was much better during our 2006 summer break. The selection of food was good but they were catering for the Americans with constant burgers and corn dogs which is not what you expect from a 5* hotel. The steakhouse was awful. Hotel- The hotel decor is a little tried now and needs updating. The rooms are large and clean but tired and nowhere comfortable to sit. The beds are hard but if you ask for a topper they put one on straight away, which is much better. We only found out about the toppers the second week when we heard the Americans ordering them at reception, so you do have to ask they are not offered. The balconies are only small but we only ever use ours to dry swim stuff so that did not bother us. A neat clothesline is provided for you. The showers are really large and there is always hot water. No need to take any towels as fresh ones are supplied every day in the room and pool towels (different colour) at the pool. There is also a powerful hairdryer in the room but they do not have nozzles on the end. Fridge in room and optics (whisky, baccardi, gin, vodka) are restocked every two days and if you need anything ring reception they will do anything for you. Staff- Fantastic, we could not fault them at all. They work long hours and are always smiling and happy. They could not do enough for us. They work very hard at remembering you, what you drink, which activities you liked to join in etc The entertainment team do a fantastic job and try to include everyone. They also speak several languages so everyone can join in if they wish. Pampering- There is lots of choice if you fancy spoiling yourself. I had two deep massages whilst there which cost \u00a344 each but I can highly recommend them FANTASTIC! Anything on this list there is a charge for. Beach- The beach has changed so much since 2006. There are sand bags everywhere, some at the steps of the hotels and others that we can only describe as huge whales, which are in the sea. Apparently the hurricane did quite a bit of damage to the beach and they sand bags are a preventative measure. Beware of letting your children play on these large sand bags because we saw several people (mostly adults) who had slipped on them and were either in wheelchairs with casts on or on crutches. We went to the beach on 4 occasions and on two of them the lifeguards were stopping people going into the sea and the red flags were flying. An adult was removed from the sea covered up, obviously dead. The current is very strong if you go too far out. Trips- we had done the swim with Dolphins (fantastic) and other trips of interest in 2006 and just wanted to relax this time. We took a taxi to Akumal beach, which cost $30 each way. This is paradise. The sea is calm all the locals go there and there is a bar, which serves really good food, and the setting is fantastic. There is a snorkel and dive centre there but we are not into diving. Instead we went on a glass bottom boat which cost \u00a335 for the three of us and that was the best thing. There was just the three of us on the boat and we followed Stingrays, Turtles and saw wonderful coloured fish. The reef was fab, the trip lasted 1.5 hours and we loved it. There is a canopy over the boat so no need to worry about the sun, just enjoy. This is a perfect beach for small children. Another thing to beware of is a free trip to LAPIS jewellery. A Taxi will collect you and bring you back when you are ready, free of charge. There are some nice pieces of jewellery and very glamorous rooms but it felt like the time-share of the jewellery world. As soon as you go on a person is assigned to look after you. You dare not look at a piece without they take that piece and put it on a tray and then a higher manager moves in and starts to apply pressure. I was so uncomfortable in there and could not wait to escape. There are lots of jewellery stores in the 5th avenue shopping area but we didn\u2019t buy anything because a British family were warning people as they approached not to buy as their mother had paid a lot of money for a diamond ring and when she got back to the uk took it to have it valued. She showed us the letter from the valuation company very detailed saying the diamond was glass. The store would not give her money back and suddenly had difficulty understanding English. The lady was heartbroken and that was enough to put us off. It\u2019s a long way back if you have a problem........ To sum up, lovely hotel that needs refurbishing. Would never go at Easter time again. The Americans going to Mexico is only a few hours and Mexico relies on their custom during the six-week break. They are catered for and looked after because unlike the British who will not complain they are very vocal. We felt like second-rate dinners. We often saw the management going from table to table in the evening asking the Americans if they were happy, any problems etc but couldn't work out why they never asked us. How they knew that we were not American. It was only later that we noticed that we had Red all-inclusive bands on while the Americans had White, enough said!!!", "Date": "April 3, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "5.0", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wales", "Title": "\u201cEx Hotel, Great location,\u201d", "Author": "Dog_Spheroids", "ReviewID": "UR14680658", "Content": "Went to Mexico, with intention of avoiding Cancun & Cozumel island, due to over crowding noise, & tackiness level.

Got on plane to find that they had assigned bulkhead seats, which meant I could not extend my leg at all \u2026 much worse than standard seats \u2026 took it up with rep on arrival, to be told would be sorted for return trip \u2013 it wasn\u2019t \u2026 so be warned. On outbound flight took off on time form Birmingham, with the advice it then stops at Manchester, re-fuels plane, change crew and we would be on our way in 20 mins \u2026.. If only \u2026 2.5 Hrs sitting on Manchester tarmac (they didn\u2019t let us off plane), and then an 10.5Hr flight after that \u2026. Excuse was that an admin issue would not let new crew on-board. Next time I will not fly from Birmingham. Arrived & Hotel transfer no problem, and checked into the Riu Tequila \u2026. And very impressed. Room was large, although with a small balcony, no views \u2026 fully stocked mini-bar, and even fully stocked optics \u2026 and refilled frequently. Hotel had a very large pool complex \u2026 2 pools split by restaurant & bar \u2026 never had a problem with sun loungers, although many Germans at Hotel \u2026 which meant the reserving with a towel at 0700, even though they say it\u2019s \u2018not permitted\u2019 \u2026. If you don\u2019t do it, you will not get a lounger at pool area. OK for us as we then went to breakfast early each day \u2026 . Food overall \u2026 was excellent, loads of choice .. main restaurant had many main courses each day, as well as a separate area serving \u2018things American .. pizza, burger, fries\u2019 Food always fresh, and hot food was hot. Large choice of salads, meats, rice pasta etc. \u2026. And likewise huge choice of deserts. There were special nights \u2026 Mexican, Oriental, BBQ .. etc. \u2026. Variety & Quality exceeded any other Hotel we have stayed at on Holiday. Of course free wine with meal, beer or whatever you wanted. Lunch was also on for what seemed half of the day (in pool area restaurant) again loads of fresh dishes, and surprising too see the sheer quantity that some people could put away in the middle of the day ! There were Beer taps, and also Pepsi, orange etc., which were on all day so you could drink as much as you wanted. Each night there is a Steak Restaurant special, you need to book \u2026 we did it once, a multi course meal, it was OK, but if we return I would probably not do it again. The bars at night were great \u2026 in some AI hotels getting served is hard work, here .. as soon as you approach the bar, whatever you want \u2026 get half way through your drink and they want to serve you another \u2026 services & ease of getting drinks was excellent. I\u2019ll admit we worked our way through the cocktail lists \u2026 with Margarita and Daiquiri being the favourites. There was entertainment each night .. and it was obviously much better than at the neighbouring Riu Palace & Riu Yucatan as all the people came up form there for the shows. The Michael Jackson show was very professional and everyone enjoyed it. Each night there was the cringing bit where they awarded the prize certificates for the day .. and no this was not just kids, there were several middle aged Americans who took rifle shooting, petaq, etc. \u2026 very seriously indeed. We went to the beach a couple of times \u2026 a 5in easy walk along a private \u2018pergola\u2019 lined lane (between 2 Riu Hotel) and with a golf buggy transport for those who could not handle this. There is a beach front bar/restaurant which is part of one of the other Riu Hotels \u2026 and very pleasant to sit there watching the unbelievably turquoise water, large waves (very large) crash onto the beach. White sand, and palm trees \u2013 very much the Caribbean post card. I think the beach is busy in the mornings, but we went early afternoon and had no problem with loungers. Towel service provided for pool/beach. On first 2 days water was very rough \u2026 so much so that people were being \u2019sucked\u2019 out to sea \u2026 pretty dangerous if you were not a very strong swimmer. After that it was much calmer .. but still has waves \u2026 did not see it flat calm. In fact I was there to scuba dive \u2013 and first 2 days were cancelled due to sea state, even the harbour was officially closed \u2013 told it\u2019s normal for this time of year. I did go diving, with \u2018Dive Mex\u2019, an Internet set up that uses the Scuba Libre shop in Playa Del Carmen for kit, boat etc. The ocean diving was good, saw more turtles on one dive than I had ever seen in a week before \u2026 but the reefs were not that good, certainly not as good as the Red Sea. We then dived the Cenotes \u2026 very unique Fresh water caves in the Mayan Jungle \u2026.. wow \u2013 and I mean wow, a really different dive experience \u2026 so unique, that the rest of the week we dived these \u2026 different Cenote on each dive. For night times \u2026 we either watched the show, or caught a cheap ($5)cab ride into PDC (5 min ride) \u2026 and walked along 5th Avenue \u2026 this has all the shops, glitz, glamour, traditional and tack \u2026 plus loads of bars & restaurants. We didn\u2019t eat out as we were AI, but there was plenty of choice \u2026 but it did look fairly expensive, talking to people working there .. they said that with the $ taking a tumble, the whole Mexican tourist trade is now reliant on German & UK visitors for it\u2019s income. Although I personally also noticed a lot of Canadians at the hotel. Wildlife \u2026 many Iguanas ..(more than a metre long) walking around the gardens & pool area, we also saw snakes, monkeys, things that looked like guinea pigs on steroids, and troops of large long tailed monkeys. Loads of wildlife, but all safe & no threat. Would I go again \u2026 for sure, but with 2 caveats \u2026 not from Birmingham, and would try & find a 10 day break, a week was not enough. Would I stay at Riu Tequila again \u2026.. no doubt about that, great hotel - highly recommended.", "Date": "March 31, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Philadelphia", "Title": "\u201cMy story of the Riu Tequila\u201d", "Author": "rdrdeano", "ReviewID": "UR14669109", "Content": "Ok, here it is. I am writing this review after returning from the Riu Tequila for a full week. I travelled from Philadelphia with my wife, son (6) and daughter (4). My wife and I booked this trip last September wanting to go away during my son's Easter break. We picked the Riu Tequila after hearing good things about the Riu chain. We had been to the Playa del Carmen area about 7 years ago. The time we went (Easter break) was quite pricy so we picked the Tequila considering everything else because the price was reasonable. I did my homework reading the reviews on this site both before and after I booked the trip. I continued to read the reviews up to the day before we left in order to set my expectations. One thing you need to consider about my review is that we have spoiled ourselves in the best visiting the Beaches in Turks and Caicos 3 times over the past 5 years as well as several time shares including ones in Cancun. I'll start with the good. 1) The price. Compared to the other Riu's in the Playa del Carmen area, I would say the price of this one makes sense. After seeing the two Riu's that are beachside (you cannot go to the Palace Riu's - this is important so don't think that you can even if someone tells you in advance) I am glad that I did not pay the extra amount. The beach isn't great - there is a lot of beach erosion. We aren't really beach people anyway and we know that the beaches in Mexico tend to be on the rough side. We much prefer being by the pool. I would say that the pool at the Tequila is equal to that of the others and the walk to the beach was 15 minutes door to beach. With that being said, I am glad I didn't pay the extra amount. 2) The architecture - aside from the rooms (more on that later) I was very impressed by the architecture of the resort. The two restaurants that you will eat in are very impressive. The one between the two pools is a huge \"hut\". This is where lunch is served and doubles as the steak restaurant at night. The one that is attached to the main building is where you will eat the breakfast and dinner buffets. This room is huge. 3) The employees with the exception of a few, I would have to say that the employees were very friendly. A few dollars in tips will help to ensure that you get a little better service. For instance, it seems that no one tips the dinner servers. These are the guys that get you the drink you want. I tipped a few bucks every night, generally sat in the same area, and each night the service got better and better. I was finishing up my beer and the server was on top of getting me the next one. The one notable exception to the service was the towel \"nazi\" (please excuse the expression. It appears that you are only allowed to get new pool towels once per day. If you go towards the end of the day they generally say \"no\". You need towels b/c you need to reserve pool chairs for the next day. This employee was probably the most unpleasant person that I encountered on my trip. The other thing that I thought was pretty cool is that the employees look for opportunities to sit with the guests at lunch. We didn't have this happen b/c there were 4 of us and the tables were for 4. But we did continuously notice groups of 2 or 3 were a Riu activites employee asked to sit with them. The employees are taught multiple languages as part of their employment so we met some that spoke Spanish (obviously), English, Dutch, German, Italian, etc. I was pretty impressed by that. 4) Food - All things considered I was pleasantly surprised by the food. The mexican reservation resort is actually on a different resort. We ate dinner at the buffet 5 times and the steak restaurant twice. The buffets have a lot of variety and there is no problem taking a little of a lot, figuring what you like, and then going back for more of that. We didn't bother with the mexican b/c a) it was at a different resort, and b) you get enough mexican food at the buffets that we didn't feel it was necessary. 5) Day activites - I would have to say that the staff did a great job getting everyone engaged and involved in activities. I did some beach volleyball, some water polo, etc. My kids also enjoyed the kids activities. The one thing that is strange about the activity desk is that it closes from about noon til 3pm. I tried to get the shuffleboard equipment during this time but no luck. Now for the bad 1) Reservations - it is crazy how early you need to get up. You can only make same day reservations, and you basically need to be waiting in line by 6:30 am to get a decent chance of the time/ place you want. They only have two seatings at the steak restaurant 7pm and 9pm and seats are limited. The guy comes out a 7am to take the reservations and the entire process is done by 7:30am. If you came after that time there would be no signs that the process even happened. If so, better luck the next day. I just feel that the same day only and how early the process requires you to be up is a little rough for a vacation. 2) Reserving beach chairs - Funny thing is that they have signs up telling you not to and that \"management\" reserves the right to remove things.... Well let me tell you - if you are not up by 6:30 you are in the back row. They have the primary circle around the pool and then a second and even third; however, if you want to by along the pool - like we did b/c we have the 2 young kids - you need to get up early. 3) Rooms - The rooms were probably the worst thing about the resort. The beds were horrible. I read reviews prior to leaving that talked about hard beds. Well mine were the softest thing ever. My lower back hurt so bad after the first night that the entire morning of the second day I was left in pain. I ended up sleeping on the cot that we got for my son from that point forward. Yes a cot was more comfortable than the two double beds in the rooms. The bed spreads, curtains, etc were extremely outdated and blah. There is really no seating area so I often left the room while others were getting ready. The stories about mildew, missing tiles, etc are also true - at least for my room. The air did work which was a positive. The TV is nothing to look forward to - small and bad reception. And then there were the bugs... 4) Misquitoes - Yes, they have lots of these flying aroud the room. Surprisingly they weren't over agressive. I did receive some bites, but not as much as I expected considering the # that were flying around the room. I too had someone come and spray but that didn't really do much. I didn't really notice the misqs other than in the room and in the buffet restaurant. But that was more than enough for me. 5) The shows - I didn't get to see any of them b/c they start after 9:30 at night. This was entirely too late for us b/c my kids were drained by this time. They never really adjusted to the time difference - we were up by 7am every day so by 9:30 they were spent after jumping in the water non stop. I heard they were good but don't get too excited if you have young kids like I do. They do; however, engage the kids on stage from 8ish for about an hour. This was great to keep the kids up until about 9 at least. 6) r/t to the airport - our travel agent (Apple Vacations) supplies the r/t transfers. I would have to guess that the r/t cost would have been about $200 if we didn't have this. I am putting this in the review to help set the expectations for those that don't have this inclusion. So that's about it. Would I go back - not unless it was free. I did hear that they are doing a make over from the end of August through December. They really only need to make over the rooms and the pool bottom. I don't know if that are doing the rooms. I certainly hope so. I personally prefer Cancun over the Riveria Maya region. Less r/t commute. The plus to the region is if you plan on taking day trips to places like XCaret or Tulum it is an hour closer. This resort is definitely not a 5 star resort. It is nice, but don't get your expections up too much. I would highly recommend reading the reviews on this site and setting your expections accordingly.

The beds were hard as rocks..we complained and 10 min later they put a cusion on top of the bed which still didnt make a difference. Maid staff was good and mini fridge was restocked daily. Room was very clean. Food- If you want to eat at an A la carte be prepared to stand in line at 7 am, hope you dont like sleeping in. We could not get a reservation for dinner once. Buffet was ok but I have had better. Beach- We went there on our first day and didnt return. It's a short walk but the beach is not impressive at all. Sure the water is blue and the sand white but there are sand bags everywhere. If you like to take walks on the beach this is not a great place to do it!!! We ended up going to a public beach called Mamita's almost everyday. It is at the end of the srtrip and is a 8$ cab ride from the resort. It is quite busy there and there is a DJ playing most days which we like. You can rent chairs for 2$ or if you really want to go all out you can rent a king size bed for 40$. We brought a cooler bag with us and brought drinks from the room so we didnt have to spend too much money. You can eat at the restaurant there for a reasonable price 15$ for two of us and the food is good and hot!!! The beach there is gorgeous with not a sand bag in site!!! Grounds- The resort was very nice and kept very clean. There were 2 pools at the tequila which were ok. If you want chairs you have to get up very early to get them as everyone puts there towels on the chairs. The one morning we did go to the pool I saw one of the workers taking peoples towels off the chairs so other people could use them. There are signs posted everywhere not to save chairs but people do it anyway. Also I saw people come to the pool later in the morning and the staff found them chairs and put them where they wanted. Playa Del Carmen- It's a great city lots of bars and lots of shops, you can walk for miles. I went there for a day last year when I was in the Mayan and did not realize how big the city actually is. It is very americanized but we dont mind that. There are a million restaurants to choose from so good luck deciding. The staff- Great, the bartenders were very quick no matter how many people were at the bar. We only watched a couple of shows which I found to be quite good and I have seen a million shows in the carribean. The entertainment staff were very nice and entertaining. All in all we had a great trip but it was no thanks to the resort. I stayed at the Grand Palladium Riviera last year which was a hundred times better.

Perhaps could use a little refreshing when it comes to the pool area. Just a little rundown but clean. The hotel seemed to be running at capacity but even so, the service was superb. There is always staff close at hand to offer you are drink or restock your in room bar. We found the beach a little small due to hurricane erosion but it's big enough to have a little of your own space and the waves are big and refreshing. If you want to get away from the crowds you can grab a cab and 5 mins. later you can be in downtown Playa Del Carmen where the beach is huge and beautiful and the sea-side restaurants serve up fresh and tasty mexican dishes to give you a boost for walking the beach and the cobblestone streets or just bobbing in the crystal blue water. The restaurants at the hotel are great and there is always something tasty to snack on at the poolside or beachside buffets. Our favourite time of day was breakfast where you can dine in elegant fashion in the mammoth dining hall that is decked out in marble walls and floors. It is very nice to have your breakfast in such a beautiful surrounding. What a breakfast it is too! You have your choice of every type of egg dish there is and then you can stroll the 3 huge buffet tables and pick any kind of side dishes that you wish. I could go on and on.

Yeah the rooms are a bit dated but kept extremely clean. The food at the main dining room buffet was as good as I have seen anywhere, you will gain a few pounds for sure. The walk to the beach is no problem, although the beach is in a sad state due to mother natures wrath. It is also pretty dangerous with the giant sandbags they have in place to prevent further erosion, the lifeguard had to go in to help adults who got caught with the undertow and tide so if you have kids be watchful at the beach. Overall we had a great time we especially enjoyed the late afternoons at the pool bar with Julio and Veronica (bartenders) they are a hoot! We booked a snorkling trip thru the Sunquest agent who told us we must book fast as it goes quickly, we booked immediately as there was 6 of us. They use \"Fat Cat Tours\" when we went to pay the next day they told us we couldn't go on the day we had booked, that screwed up our other plans, The trip was not good we only saw about 6 different types of fish (big dissapointment for the money) , anyway we found out later from some folks at the WYNDAM hotel (on the other side of the Riu Palace) that they had a great trip for only $10 more and that included lunch, dinner and was an all day trip. Be warned!! Again this was our only problem on the trip. We had agreat time but prefer Cozumel, nicer beaches and calmer water and much better snorkling.

Check in was a breeze and our room was ready even though we arrived at 9am. ROOMS:I had read some of the other reviews about how the rooms were outdated, yes they were but they are still nice. we liked having a balcony with chairs. we stayed in 1708 witch was close to everything, but yet it was still quiet. there is a room safe but it did not seem that safe, it was old. There is also a mini fridge, with pop and coronas they refill them every other day. the rooms were kept clean and the maids are very nice if you need something(more towels,pillows ect.)they will bring it for you. FOOD: there is something for everyone we were worried about our picky eater but she always found something! we loved breakfast, great selection of food and it was always good. The only thing we did not like was in order to make reservations to the two a la carte resturants you had to be up in the loby and in line by 6:15 am to get them and only for the day that you make them. So we didn't bother there was so much at the buffet to eat. POOLS: there are 2 pools to choose from, both big and clean, we swam mostly at the one with the swim up bar! awesome bartenders, they were very good to the kids making them alchol free frozen drinks! and if you want to get a lounger by the pool make sure you save one by 7am!!they ask not to do that but everyone did. The beach was nice too it was not that far of a walk(you have to go through riu yucatan)they also have a golf to take you there which runs every couple of minutes. you also must save a lounger there by no later than 8am. we saved loungers early than ate breakfast at the riu yucatan. They are trying to rebuild the beach from the hurricane 2yrs ago and it is not as bad as I have read in some of the reviews. STAFF: they were so friendly and hard working, and they were not pushy at all! they were always smiling and joking around! GROUNDS:everything is so lush and colourful and very well maintained. THINGS TO DO:we also went to xel-ha which was also great if you plan to go snorkling bring you own, they charge 20us per person to rent. I am glad we brought our own masks ect..

Everyone mentioned the Riu chain of resorts and the reviews on this site were excellent so we decided to stay here. All I can say is that this place is incredible. The location is lovely, the staff are extremely friendly and the food is unbelievably good. We spent many lazy days around the pool or by the beach (which is a 10min walk or 5 min golf cart ride) and ate like royalty. I cannot tell you how good the food was. We ate at both a la carte restaurants which were both excellent, however, we preferred the variety of the buffet. (you will need to wake early to get a reservation for the a la carte restaurants). The rooms were large and we had a ground floor room with a nice patio. There were a few bugs about but I called reception and someone came round in a matter of minutes with some spray. Rooms were stoked with as much as alcohol as you desire and each day a lovely towel puppet was left on the bed! The pools are very nice -- but maybe need a bit of touching up as they are looking a little worn. The event staff are great and we went out night to Cancun with a couple of the guys. It was a fantastic night and I hadn't had such an amazing night like that in years. Plus it helps to be with a local as you can by-pass alot of the lines. You will not be disappointed.

The hotel itself is beautiful with plenty of spaces outdoors to eat, swim, drink and relax. There is a great selection of bars to choose from of which our favourite was the pool bar that you can swim up to. We suspected they watered down the cocktails at this bar during the day for health and safety reasons but that was certainly not indicative of service in the evening or at other bars. They have plenty of entertainment day and night ranging from yoga (which looked lovely but frankly I just wanted to lie in the sun and read! ) to rifle shooting - thankfully this was done elsewhere as we never heard it! At night there is entertainment on in the outdoor auditorium but if you prefer a quiet drink this is also an option. We also loved the mini bar in the room - we had our own optics as well as a fridge full of beer, water and mixers so you could make your own drinks in your room if you fancied. I cant fault the staff here they were lovely and vey friendly. And despite what a lot of American reviews said before we went, tipping was not an issue so there is no pressure to tip at the bar if you get a drink. However we dined in the waterfront restaurant a few times and as this was table service we always left a tip. The food was great and plentiful, you can eat and drink 24 hours a day here and my Fiance is a veggie and was equally happy! There are even popcorn machines and nachos at the pool bar so if you fancy a wee snack poolside you dont have to go far to find something. the grounds were beautiful and wonderfully tended to, we saw gardeners every day working to make sure the paths were free of leaves and they were always smiling and saying \"hola\" For animal lovers there are wild iguanas, small mamals that I cant name but are very friendly and will do almost anything for a piece of banana! There are also butterflies, birds and many lizards to keep you amused but none were an issue in terms of feeling like we were overrun, they were a delight to spot. The private beach is small but perfectly formed and you can walk up along to quieter stretches if you want some privacy. For excursions we chose not to book with the rep (Thomson tend to rip you off) and instead booked through Grey Line tours who have a base along the road by the shopping centre. We booked through them to visit Chechen Itza and it cost half what the rep was charging for a longer trip! We had the most amazing time and would recommend this hotel to anyone looking to enjoy the caribbean, relax and have a romantic get away. There were also quite a few children adn the kids area looked fab so really it is ideal for anyone! I would definitely go to another Riu Hotel in the future as they really do go out of their way to make you welcome and looked after.

Overall I enjoyed the hotel and the sister hotel Riu Yucatn and it's beaches. Be careful on the beach as it has strong waves and some under-toe. If travelling with kids make sure you have them with water floating toys or something. Everyone we talked to lost sunglasses or something in the water. I believe the Mexicans need a breaker wall further out to prevent further lost of the beach along that coastline. The water was warm and still beautiful blue.....nicer than Puerto Vallarta. I have some helpful advice for people who want to go to Playa Del Carmen. (It's a 30 minute walk or $5 cab ride.) First beware of the Police...yes I said the Police. We rented scooters from outfront of the hotel and went into town ($40 for 2 hrs). We were told from the rental place that the streets run one way so if you turn around watch for this. However we were not told that it's one way parallel and crosswise also (grid). The signs, well they are not posted where they should be and not there at all in some cases. Long story short we turned onto a one-way and a cop standing on the corner let us do it. He radio another officer on a motorcycle to go to the end of the street we had turned onto and pull us over. His english was not good at all and our spanish was terrible. He did manage to tell us we need to show him a drivers license. Of course our ID was in the safe at the hotel. He told us that was another infraction on top of the wrong turn. I said there was no sign and he didn't care. Apparently the charges were going to be about $100. He then made us follow him up the street and pull over again. We were confused. He then wanetd to know who much money we had on us. He jestered to put the money inside of a book he held out.. We gave him $40 US as this is all we had on us at the time. He just asked if everything was ok then, and left. So basically he pocked the money! I was pretty angry at this point as they are there to protect not rob tourists. We went back to the hotel and got our ID and told the people at the rentals what happened. They felt bad and told us we don't need a license because it's only good in Canada anyway. And that tourist are allow 3 infactions because they don't know the area, and it's easy to make a mistake. This left a bad taste in my mouth the rest of the week. The downtown was lively to say the least. Lots of cool bars and resturants. The shopping was plentyful and very beautiful shops....but the prices were beyond retarded!! I love silver jewelry and bought hoards of pieces last year in Puerto Vallarta for very fair prices. I bought one thing this year because they asked far too much for things. They'd barter a little but still let you walk. Likely due to the fact that Playa Del Carmen is too over run with tourists that don't know any better. So they don't care if you buy it or not for the \"fair\" price. My advice is check at Winners here before you go there and spend a fortune. They have the same stuff come from Mexico for way less money then you'd pay right in Playa Del Carmen. The other issue I found that that ruins the beauty of the town was the \"tipping\" expected EVERYWHERE you go. You are expected to tip the taxi driver, the shuttle to and from the airport, the maid, the bartenders, the guy or lady in the bathroom who hands you a paper towel, the band you watched at the bar who you just paid premium price for the beer you drank.....$3.50 each US. The fire dancers at the Blue Parrot (which by the way were amazing to see if you go on at 11:30 pm) the guy in the street who had lizzards/birds and you want to take a picture with YOUR camera, or the guy in Aztec attire, not allowed to take his picture without a tip to him also. By the end of the trip it was a bit much to say the least. I believe in tips but if you WANT to give one and not for everything you do. They think everyone is rich, but I work hard to take my one trip a year and I don't think it was right. The cab ride was $5 from the hotel one way, I suggest you ask before you get in...just say $5? There is a place downtown that you can get dropped off by cab and you can hop on the Collectivo's. In front of the shoe store called Tres Humbrese (Three Brothers in english). They are vans that run between Playa Del Carmen and Tulum all day. They way they work is you pay $3.00 for two people from Playa Del Carmen and from Tulum $6.00 for two people. (more on the way back) They will drop you off on the way anywhere you want on the highway. (Same prices if you go all the way or not) On the way back stand at the roadside and put your hand out. If they flash their lights they will stop if they have room. We used them to go to Akumel to snorkel at Yal Ku Lagoon. Well worth it. You need to take a cab (just walk in a little bit from the highway, use the overpass walk-way to cross the highway). $6 cab ride in to Lagoon it's a long walk. They charge $7 admission and if you need snorkel equipment and life jackets it comes to about $20 total per person. I've never snorkelled before so this was perfect. You can swim for as long as you want at your own leisure. Not rough at all, and FISH everywhere. Bright beautiful colours and small rock cave like spots to swim around and through. I loved it! In Akumel the Half moon beach is supposed to be amazing for turtles although we did not see this ourselves. This area made you feel like you were really away from it all. Very pretty place to see. The other tour we did was ATV rentals. We booked at the plaza to the left of the Riu Tequila. It was called ATV moto. We paid $60 each for three hours. They drive out of town to the beach, drove along the beach for a bit and then to the jungle. Not really a jungle but rather a heavier treed area. Then you go to a cenote cave to swim. I don't like tight places in the water, but my boyfriend went, his first time and LOVED it! Super clear water. It had some lights down there and natural light from rock cut above. There were bats, but they stayed clear of me. Some really cool bird (forget the name) was there mating season in caves too. Ricardo was our guide and our group was five of us. We were the only people there in the afternoon to it was perfect. Well worth what we paid. We gladly tipped the tour guide as he made the excursion!! We even stopped at a store to grab a quick beer with him. : ) I hope this helps others as I researched on trip advisor to find out things before I went, so I want to pay back what I learned.

We really do not have that high of standards, but this resort should not be a 4 or 5 star resort. We went with our family of husband and wife and 5 year old daughter and 3 year old son. Food: The food was plentiful (as all buffetsare), but overcooked meat and under cooked fish consistantly everyday. As others commented, you will not go hungry, but you will want better selection. Lettuce was washed with bleech.. you could smell it and taste it. No coffee available in rooms... only available at sports bar in the morning where the line up was 10-15min every morning. There was no food available from 5pm to 6:30pm except sports bar ... when you have kids and a semi-schedule, that is important. Our boy had bad stomach problems... and eventually threw up the 4th night at the table and in the room. We all experienced 'travellors poops'- 2 of us for 4 days plus and we were prepared with all the meds. It seemed when we went into Playa Del Carmen for a real dinner it all stopped. If you want to eat at the steak house you have to be in line at 6:40am (on your vacation) for a spot at 7pm. I waited 2x and was 4th and 8th in line to be told that the 7pm seatings were taking up by wedding parties... very disappointing!!! We can not eat with kids at 9pm seatings. This is not a 24hr food resort... very limiting. Pools: Both pools were the perfect temperature. We saw them testing regularly and cleaning the leaves out every 2-3 hours. Both pools had a tremendous amount of paint chippings inside the pool... definately needs to be updated with new paint. It did not affect our swim, but it should be noted. The swim up bar had the best staff. Always fast, friendly and they were the only ones I felt that deserved the extra tip. Went over to the Yukatan pools as well... very nice as well... overlooked the ocean. Rooms: Because of this website, we requested the upper room. Still very 'musty', but better than the first floor. Yes, the rooms we out dated... but extremely clean! The beds were the worst we have ever experienced. Very hard and unforgiving. I did not have one relaxing sleep because of the beds. Maid service was not good unless we tipped. We waited for 2 days to get fridge restocked and toilet paper... the day we tipped is the day we got toilet paper and fridge restocked. The temperature or air conditioning only had one setting and could not be lowered. For the Children: Very disappointing ... our 5yr old daughter wanted to play with other kids. Went over to the shack for kids activities... young girl doing the activities said she did not feel good and threw some marbles in the kids pool and told the kids to go get them for points. When finished, they went over to throw real darts at a dart board right beside volleyball court. Letting 4-8yrs throw real darts was very entertaining, but very unsafe. One day they had Spiderman and Superman dressed up walking around the pool telling kids to come see them at the 9:30pm show... we kept the kids up- no Superman and no Spiderman. The play area for the kids is very basic as well. Entertainment: Water polo, poolside dancing, volleyball, bocce ball, darts, excercise... no pressure to play or do, but fun nonetheless. Night activities... disco was for younger crowd and ngihtly shows were not the best, but just OK. Speacial Activities: Booked trip with Captain Ricks for fishing. Excellent! Our boat caught 70lb sailfish, 2 20lb Jacks and a Baraccuda with 2 knockoffs... very skilled captain! Also went to Xel-Ha... great for snorkelling, big whole day experience. Expensive (look for deals), do not bring young children as it is a large area to walk and even larger area to snorkel. Would recommend XCaret for younger kids. Went into town for 5 dollar cab ride... ate at Blue Lobster. Biggest Lobsters in my life- best meal of the trip. Why not a 4 or 5 star: Food was not anywhere near top quality and could not get into the only special restaurant for regular food. There qaulity of childrens activities, play area and supervision was aweful. The rooms were outdated, musty and beds extremely hard. The pool needed a full overhauling of cleaning and painting. Regular service and maid service were only adequate, not exceptional in any way. Entertainment was just OK. After reading all the reviews, I am very disappointed our family feels this way.

We got ushered to our bus where they took us to our resort, the staff were hilarious and fed us booze while going to our resort! Lol. When we got to the hotel, Riu Tequila, we were offered right away a drink, and check in was smooth and easy! Strapped out wrist bands on and walked to our room! Our room was at the very back of the resort, but I didnt mind. The only problem I had was when we got into the room and I went to the bathroom, there was an ENORMOUS cockroach. OMG. I freaked out, LOL. A staff member came just in time when he dropped off our luggage, I tipped him extra to get the ugly thing out of our room. So our room wasn't anything special, but I honestly didn't care because we were hardly in there anyways. The cool thing was we had a liquor dispenser in our room, along with Coronas and other bevvies in our mini fridge which was stocked up every second day. The pool was nice! We spent alot of time at the swim up bar. Lol, we met amazing people from England and hung out with them alot of the time, we STILL talk to them via email! :D The food was good, although my boyfriend got a bit of the traverlers poops, Hahaha! PACK IMODIUM, PEOPLE! That is the most important thing you have to bring, lol. He only had half a day with it, but recovered quickly thanks to Imodium and alot of booze.... ? Lol. The buffets we're awesome, alot of selection, great smelling food, and really good desserts! I LOVED the pizza there. The beach was amazing! At the front of your hotel, theres a little golf cart that will drive up every 10 minutes and will shuttle you down to the beach, it takes 2 minutes to get there. When we first went to the beach we were like ..OH MY GOD. Since this is our first trip, we have nothing to compare too, but we were both very excited to get in! We picked our spots and dived in! Which prolly wasnt a good idea without goggles because its very ...salty. Haha. But it was amazing! Theres alot of topless girls though! I almost went topless but ..got scared when an old lady walked by naked... lol. So I give the beach 5 stars! TIPS!! So I highly reccomend purchasing the Royal Swim excursion. Swimming with the dolphins was amazing. Theyre were two of them and they come up behind you, put their noses to your feet and push you up and forward, I loved it! Snorkeling was good as well, although it did start to rain during that time, (it was October, but the rain storms lasted 10 minutes then would go away) I'm not too sure if the Coba ruins are still open, but if your interested in history and ruins, I suggest you go there! We did a zip line, climbed up the Coba stairs that were like...600 steps. lol Experianced Mayan culture, went canoeing.. it was excellent. Go to 5th AVE! Cheap booze! And there you get to barder with people! Your resort rep will teach you how to barder with the mexicans, its fun :P Over all we had an amazing experiance, met some good people, ate beautiful food, beach was amazing, took some awesmoe pictures, discovered history, and relaxed and got drunk!

We had a great time. We arrived pretty late but check in was very smooth, they basically had a package ready for us with our room key and towel cards and passed it right to us off the bus in the lobby. Hotel staff brought our bags up to our room. It was a good check in experience. The only downer was we thought even though it was late that we'd be able to get some \"24 hour snacks\", the snacks turned out to be cold pizza and sandwiches that you could heat up in a microwave in the sports bar. That was alittle disappointing but it didn't matter for the rest of the week cause you eat so much at breakfast, lunch and supper at all the great buffets and restaurants you aren't really thinking of food late at night. My wife and I are usually beach people but we ended up around the pool most of time, the pool area is great - we found that there wasn't much shade offered down on the beach so it was too easy to get burned and opted for a cabana by the pool. You gotta be down by around 7am to reserve your spot by the pool if you want a specific place - they fill up fast, but I think there were always places throughout the day, just maybe not right by the pool. The signs say you aren't supposed to reserve your seats by the pool, but everyone does it anyway. We enjoyed the food very much at the Tequila. Breakfast was amazing with so much to choose from, we enjoyed the omelets and fresh homemade donuts the best! Lunch in the restaurant by the pool had alot to choose from as well, if you couldn't find something you liked in there, something is wrong with you! We ate mostly at the buffets, one night we ate at the Steakhouse and really enjoyed it, the meal was great, service excellent, and the atmosphere was perfect (it happened to be raining alittle the night we were there and it was nice to hear the rain outside. Another night we tried the Mexican restaurant and were alittle disappointed, the meal and especially the service wasn't near as good as at the Steakhouse. The staff at the Tequila were great, no complaints at all. Bar staff work extremely hard and appreciate any tip you may give, but as others have said, it\u2019s not expected and they give you good service regardless ...but a little tip goes a long way and might get you your drinks even faster!: ) The best bartender was Julio, what a funny guy, he will keep you laughing doing things like singing or tying knots in your straws. My wife couldn't figure out why she couldn't get a sip of her drink one morning at the pool bar!: ) The entertainment staff, what can say about them? Great. They start working in the mornings and are still working late at night! Seemed to me they genuinely love their jobs and it showed by their always smiling faces (way to go Nemo!). We enjoyed many of the activities around the resort, my wife did the dance lessons acouple days, and I played some volleyball. We always felt welcome to participate (but not forced) and had some good times laughing with the workers. We also thought the night shows were very good, the dancing by the entertainment staff was really quite good. Get your seats for the shows alittle early if you want a good seat though! Some people have commented that the rooms are alittle dated, that may be true, but we had no complaints. We don't go to Mexico to hang out in our hotel room anyways. Our room was extremely clean and our room attendant took good care of us and treated us to new towel art each day (thanks Antonio!). And for those that drink, you'll enjoy the in-room bar and stocked fridge! Town (Playa De Carmen) was only a $5 cab ride away, we took a cab once and another day just walked in, only takes about 25 mins each way to walk it. Shopping was ok in town, good place to pick up afew things to take home. Overall, we really enjoyed our stay at the Tequila. We've been to Mexico twice before (Cancun and also Puerto V) and we both agree that this area and hotel was our favorite. Would we go back? For sure, though for us we like to see new spots so we might try somewhere else just for fun. Hope this review is helpful.

Happily, we were not disappointed with the Riu Tequila! The first day we arrived the weather was appauling - the tail end of a tropical storm leaving it very cold & rainy, but later in the week the weather improved and was really pleasant, but this did not detract from our stay. The hotel was clean and well laid out with plenty of bars but only 1 restaurant for breakfast & dinner (the restaurants at other Rius could be used for lunch) which though not a major problem at breakfast, did result in long queues to get a table for dinner - a thing we have never experienced at any Riu or any other Caribbean hotel before. The hotel was filled to capacity & this did make the dining experience closer to a work's canteen than a hotel dining room, especially as certain holiday-makers allowed their children to treat the dining room like an extension of the playground, running amok & even roller skating in the dining room! With the ability to only dine once a week at each of the specailist restaurants the choices were a microwaved burger from the Sports bar or put up with it! The food was OK but extremely bland and with such long queues to contend with it was invariably cold by the time you got back to your table. The other down-side of the dining room is that smoking is allowed - it's Ok saying it's only in 1 section, but the smoke DOES migrate throughout the dining room making it very unpleasant for non-smokers. Maybe this hotel should follow the regime of the Riu in Cape Verde which only allows smoking at the outside tables? The staff, without exception, were efficient, friendly and always eager to please - HOWEVER certain nationalities seem to leave their manners at home when on holiday - Please & Thank You cost nothing!!!!!!!! These minor irritations, certainly did not detract from the beautiful resort of Playacar - I strongly advise anybody visiting this hotel to take a walk into Playa del Carmen & stroll down 5th Avenue then explore the streets radiating off. There is a lovely bird garden in Playacar itself which is well worth the money - a really calm oasis full of beautiful birds that you can get really close to. The resort itself is full of birds and animals - fantastic photo opportunities are around every corner, so make sure your camera is always with you. We went on 2 trips, the obligatory Chitchen Itza, which we found disappointing as it was SO commercialised - it was like attending a Car Boot sale no matter where you walked and be aware that you can no longer climb the pyramid there, which nobody advised you of until after you'd bought your ticket & gone in! We also visited Coba and Aktun Chen both of which were amazing - totally unspoiled and with a fascinating guide. I thoroughly recommend this trip where the ruins in Coba are still being excavated and you CAN climb the pyramid, which is as high as the Chichen Itza one, to see miles of virgin rainforest - truly breath-taking!

I really wish we had stayed for 2 weeks as 1 week was not enough, though next time we will stay in one of the more expensive, newer Riu hotels in this resort with better restaurant facilities, however for a family with children or anybody on a budget, the Tequila is more than adequate for a budget trip to Mexico.", "Date": "March 13, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cambridge, ON", "Title": "\u201cAwesome Time @ the Tequila!\u201d", "Author": "IluvMexico_8", "ReviewID": "UR14164920", "Content": "Hola!! Just returned from the RIU Tequila and made it home luckily inbetween two severe snow storms. Hubby and I went vacationing on Feb 28th-Mar. 6th and I cannot say enough about this resort. This is our 3rd time to the Mayan and our first to the RIU resort. Playcar has 5 RIUs and we ventured through three. The Palace was poshy, you should sign in as a guest to walk the grounds, stunning! I echo many other vacationers that the grounds on the Tequila were impeccable, clean and lush! The pools were awesome and not cold. The ocean was around 26 celius and felt like a hot tub...loved it! We were so impressed with the coridal staff and almost all spoke English. The bar service was amazing and no long line ups. We did tip on many occasions but even if you did not the service was still no.#1. The Jalisco Restaurant was beautiful and the theme dinners were terrific but you can only eat here for breakfast and supper. There was sooo much to chose from that you could have eaten forever. Don't forget to venture to the far right corner to nibble on authentic mexican cuisine! For lunch the Lupita Pool Restaurant had great variety from hot foods to cold buffets and really paks a crowd. As for the hotel room, they are a little dated but very clean and the housemaid ( a young man named Eddy) was friendly and left many towel animals for our amusement. Took a trip to the Coba Ruins. It is a must see and maybe the last time to climb the largest pyramid \" Nohoch Mul\" of 120 steps or 12 stories high! Took a cab to Playa del Carmen- cabbies wait directly outside of the hotel super convenient. The tripfare is only $5.00 US and very safe trip and take 10 minutes to arrive on 5th avenue. Lots to see and to buy! As for the poolside and securing a lounger...you bet! Even though there are signs posted everywhere do not unfortunately no one heeds this rule. We met many Canadians and some from our very own city...small world !! We truly had a blast & the weather was in the high 80s and only 10 minutes of sprinkles around 9:30 p.m. one night. We came home tanned, happy and already looking to book again for next year. This resort is a must! Ps. Forgot to mention, terrific for kidz, they have mini events, games and one hour attributed just for them at night @ the shows, very entertaining!!", "Date": "March 9, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "N-B", "Title": "\u201cGreat vacation!!!\u201d", "Author": "Annie34", "ReviewID": "UR14026828", "Content": "We have just returned from a fantastic vacation a the Riu Tequila...

All the mexicans at the resort are just soo much fun and make your stay that much better. The bar tenders especially. Veronica, Julia, and Abraham at the swim up bar are a lot of fun! If you get the chance, take a trip downtown Cancun. My friends and I went with Pablo and some other guests to Coco Bongo down there and it was insane! IT was such a good time! Downtown cancun is like Las Vegas! I suggest you do as much as possible when you are there and take advantage of the travel agent that sits in the lobby. They will tell you about the different activities you can do. As much as a lot of people like to stay at the resort, there is so much to do off the resort. As long as you go as a group, it is safe!

Wonderful grounds, great food, and courteous staff just begin to describe the experience. This is an all-inclusive hotel, and we were pleased to have transfer privileges with two other neighbor hotels also owned by Riu. Riu Tequila is not right on the beach, but a quick walk across the street to Riu Yucatan, and we were in our beach loungers in no time. This saved us some money, and we didn't find it an inconvenience at all. There are a wide range of guests - American, British, French, Spanish, etc. We literally sat at dinner with 3 different languages going on around us at once. For us, it was nice getting away from a 100% American environment. The age range is broad as well. There were many empty-nesters and retirees as well as families with children. We are in our mid-20's, and didn't notice quite as many people our age. The hotel tries to keep out college kids on spring break. There are a few things with the room that we would have changed, but we were informed by a staff member that they will be renovating the entire hotel from October - December 2008, so we assume these will be taken care of with the renovation.

Here are things to take into consideration if you think you got a great deal for a 5 stars hotel. First of all, THE RIU TEQUILA IS NOT A 5 STAR HOTEL! I give it 3 or 4 stars max. As you may started to notice it I am a bit disappointed by my trip to RIU Tequila. The thing is that it was sold to me as a 5 stars hotel and it pretend to be a 5 stars hotel. The RIU Tequila is part of a group of 5 RIU resorts that contains two Palaces and 3 other resorts. I have no doubt that both of the palaces are 5 stars. They look very nice. At least from the outside (They would let me in with my pour RIU Tequila pass) but the RIU Tequila is not. Here are the reasons why I was disappointed: The room: The deco is bad. That should matters anyways. But when the bed is hard as rock, when there are no bath (just shower) and you can notice some moldy spots in the shower, on the seal and on the lamps... you hope that you will not have rain, cause all that will be left for you is a small 15 inch TV... :-( The beach: The beach is in very bad shape in the RIU Tequila area. Once again I don't know about the palaces beaches but the RIU Tequila beach, the one you have to walk 15 minutes to get to (or wait for the shuttle... but that will be longer), is very bad. Okay, okay.. its not RIU Tequila's fault if it was destroyed by very bad weather one or two years ago, but still it something to consider. When lying on the RIU Tequila beach, on one side you have a view of a 10 feet wall of sand (resort side) and on the other side (sea side) you have a view of big bags of sand in water that looks like whales dying on the shore... and it is packed like a toy store on December 24! However if you can still walk once you reach the beach, walk a 15-20 minutes south and you get to decent beach... But that makes a total of more than 30 minutes walk! Hope you didn't forget your sun screen! Some good points: Even if there are only two \"a la carte\" restaurants (wake up urly to resevre), the food is good. But note that since I love guacamole, I was always able to find something decent to dip in it. Also, since I am a sugar addicted I have to give two thumbs up for the desert! I would still recommend it if your looking for a cheap place to stay and to eat in the Playa Del Carmen area. But not if you expect a little more... If I knew RIU Tequila was a 3 star, I wouldn't have been disappointed. Also, don't loose your time at the beach over there, take the ferry to the Cozumel island (from Playa Del Carmen - about 22$ per person (including come back ticket)), rent yourself a scooter (you can get one for about 25$ a day) or a jeep and enjoy awesome snorkeling on the island as well as the beautiful wild beaches (with nobody!). The Coronas snorkeling entrance only cost 2$. They even let you go if you buy them a beer! Once you've been there, you don't understand why people get packed on the RIU Tequila beach...

We got to the hotel before the official check in time and it wasn't a problem, we had a room ready for us right away. All of the staff work very hard especially after finding out that they work 11 hour days and 6 days a week for $600/month so a little tipping goes a long way. The grounds are beautiful and very well maintained but I would only rate this hotel a 3.5 or a 4 star but definitely not a 5 star. Rooms-The rooms are outdated and could use some work but we were never in ours except to sleep so it didn't matter. The beds are hard but we were so tired by the end of the day that we didn't even notice. The rooms are kept very clean by the maids and we had towel art left by her a couple of times during our stay. We left a note once for the minibar to be restocked and after that it was restocked daily. Pools-The pools were small but big enough to cool off from the heat. People leave their towels or personal belongings on chairs to reserve them and then the chairs sit empty for most of the day. You have to be out at the pool by 8am to get a chair or move someones stuff and just take the chair. The entertainment staff walk around the pools telling people what they are doing next to get people involved but don't push anyone into doing anything they don't want to do. Buffets and Restraunts-The buffets are good, didn't change much day to day but we founds stuff every day that satisfied us. The wait staff all work very hard appreciate tips because they don't get them that often. We tried both the steakhouse and mexican restraunt and they both were very good, didn't have a problem making a reservation for either of them on the nights that we wanted. Beach-The walk to the beach wasn't as far as we thought it would be and it was actually quite a nice walk and it helped work off all of the food and drinks. If you don't want to the beach the hotel has a shuttle to take you to the Riu Yucatan. We spent one day at the Yucatan pool and beach area and we found both areas to be very crowded but there were so many beach chairs that we found one without a problem in the middle of the afternoon. The beach wasn't as small as I thought it was going to be and had room for quite a few beach chairs. If you walk just south of the hotel, the beach becomes a lot better and very few people venture down that far so it's rather empty but beautiful. There are some women that suntan topless on the beach so beware if you are going with kids. We did a couple of extersions, we went to Xcaret where you snorkel in the underground river and then spent the rest of the day just checking out the park and all of the different sites. The next day we did a fat cat snorkeling trip, it starts out with a 40 min speed boat ride to an area where you can snorkel with sea turtles and then they took us to an inlet with undergound caves. We also went to the Coba ruins because they have the only ruin that you are still allowed to climb but only for the next year and then they took us a traditional Mayan village and showed us how they live and even took us through a couple of peoples houses. If you go to the village, make sure you bring fruit for the village children and they will give you homemade presents.", "Date": "February 19, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Calgary", "Title": "\u201cJust Average...\u201d", "Author": "Loosescrew", "ReviewID": "UR13655516", "Content": "I do not normally write reviews..but do use this site when booking a holiday...

As this was a special event for my wifes birthday I made the mistake of booking the holiday to soon on the Thomson web site. Over a period of two months by paying an additional fee I actually rebooked the holiday twice and saved a stagering \u00a3370 off the original price. \u00a335 per person each time I rebooked. If you have booked via the internet re check the price, if the price is still lower after deducting \u00a335 per person then call them and re book the holiday. They will then refund you the difference. Onto the holiday, The Thomson flight was no problem, we spent an additional \u00a370 each for extra legroom which also guarantees sitting together. The food and service were fine. Had to spend \u00a35 each on the return to upgrade the entertainment package as it was the same both ways. Cancun airport was no problem and there was only one stop before reaching the Tequila after one hours drive. After reading many poor reviews regarding the rooms I have to say that ours had been recently painted and was very clean and tidy, (3004) towels etc were changed every day.. Tipping the maid at the start of your holiday will go a long way! To actually find something wrong with the Tequila is very difficult, the staff are extremley helpfull and genuinley very nice people. The entertainment staff work extremly hard, and whilst the evening entertainment can be much of the same you do have the option of going to the other hotels. Have a look at whats on at each hotel and make a choice. The Grease night was excellent. The food is excellent ,how previous people have critised this is beond me. The only bad meal we had was at the mexican restaurant where people were leaving half way through the meal and returning to the main dinning room. Whilst the beach in front of the riu is almost non existant a five minute walk up the beach will bring you onto a lovely stretch of natural beach. They have a 12 month plan to put the beach back to original condition by December 2008 Yes I would agree from previous comments that certain areas of the pool look a bit tired and could do with re painting but I understand that the Tequila is shutting for one month in August for a total refurbishment. The most negative point of the holiday was caused by many people not being able to get a seat by the pool because of people reserving seats with towels. I have to say that we did see peole putting their towels onto the sunbeds at 10 o clock at night!! So sad!! Do as I did and if no one was siting there just move the towels and put yours there and sit down. The staff will support you. Must mention the superbowl night in the sports bar, it was a fantasic evening and the Americans reaally know how to have a great party, we had a great laugh and was made to feel very welcome. Even the Packers fans that turned up were great spoprts.. What is a cheese head?? regarding the trips, swimming with the the Dolpins at discovery cove was fantastic and worth every penny. The foot push out of the water was a great experience. The Tequila represents excellent value for money, if you want more than the Tequila has to offer then put your hand in your pocket and pay more money to stay elswhere.

ROOMS We got a room in the last building down on the end. A bit of a walk, but that was fine by us. Very clean and plenty of space for unpacking. The frig and mini bar are stocked every 2 days, but if you run out of anything, a call to the front desk will get it for you quickly. GROUNDS This is a beautiful, well kept resort. The foliage is magnificent. We walked through this resort a couple years ago and we were amazed at how everything has grown. There are a few agoutis wandering around. (There were more at Riu Yucatan when we stayed there 2years ago) We saw 38 coati mundis following in single file on top of the fence that evening. Very cool!! Saw a few wild toucans from time to time throughout our stay. STAFF Excellent staff throughout, from front desk to waiters, bartenders, maids, to grounds keepers. Always smiling and friendly. FOOD We've stayed at several AIs on Coz and PDC and Tequila has the best buffet bar none in our opinion. I've been afraid to get on a scale since we got home. :) We didn't bother to try the reservation dining as we were perfectly satisfied with the buffet food. TIP If you are early morning coffee people like us, I suggest bringing a large mug for coffee as the only place you'll find any before 7 AM is at the 24 hr. sports bar. Daniel, the overnight bartender is great. BEACH We were aware of the beach(or lack of it) situation before we came, but it wasn't a big deal to us. We had no trouble getting loungers near the large pools. After observing some early morning towel switching (Stealing someone'sbeach towel and switching it for a different colored bath towel) we didn't put out early towels. There is a steep charge for lost beach towels. We also walked the large beach south of Sandos. That area is at least twice as wide as it was a year ago . We also went into town 2 days and used the beach clubs north of the ferry. Had a great time there. ENTERTAIMENT The animation team seemed to be very hard working during the day to get the lazy tourists off their butts and taking in the many activities. We fall into the lazy category by the way. :) We didn't take in the evening shows as we enjoyed sitting on our patio evenings watching the animals on the grounds. COMPLAINTS Only one and it's a major one to us. The feral cats that are allowed to roam among the tables in the outdoor dining area. We don't mind cats usually, but these were diseased, some with huge open weeping sores on their bodies, some with broken, misshapen legs. (See photos) Our complaint isn't even so much with the hotel. There are signs everywhere warning guests against feeding the animals. What got us were the ignorant guests who we saw feeding these sickly creatures from the plates that humans use. These were obviously unvaccinated ,unwormed alley cats carrying who knows what all kinds of vermin . Now I must say that we CHOSE to be seated outdoors rather than inside the huge dining room, so we could have avoided them. All we are saying is that the cat situation is just WRONG in so many ways.

We asked reception if we could change and with no hastle - no problem at all attitude received an excellent room change the following day near the pool. Be pleasant and they will assist you as much as possible. This hotel should commend itself for its staff, who all went out of their way to ensure you had a fabulous stay, service with the biggest smile! I normally travel to the far east so this is quite a lively hotel for me in comparison but loved it all the same! They have a casino night in the lobby - playing with monoply style money which is real fun - sometimes if you win they skirt tequila in your mouth which is pretty tasteless to be honest! Which brings me onto the drinks - we didn't see local drinks being served much = all labels! Jim Beam, Ron Bacardi etc. They do not scrimp either so watch yourself. I do recommend you try the Chocolate Martini's - WOW! Forget the local wine ask for champagne - I asked for a glass of Cava and was swiftly corrected by the bar staff! The food selection is fabulous at this hotel - I have never been a fan of all inclusive, having been to Acapulco and Egypt - this is a really good one. Nice they have table cloths in the main dining room and once you have your table it is yours with a waiter serving wine/beer as you need it. Plates cleared quickly too.

Would have to say I didn't enjoy the Speciality Steak restauarant - very tough over cooked and the local cats ate well that evening. Hey! it's free and you get waited upon so give it a try. Felix the waiter trys his best for a tip! If you do have an upset tummy - AND I AM NOT SAYING anything bad about the hotel - I have a dodgy tum anyway - ask the bar staff for a tot of their local herbal liqueur called something like Fennet - I swear you will stop feeling sick within 20 minutes! Tried to buy some at the airport + they do not sell. Tastes like the worst cough medicine but hey! does the trick. Reserve your sunbeds in the sun - first day there we didn't get one at all - my husband had to get up at 6.15 am to reserve a bed in the sun ( I don't approve but needs must!). You do not need to tip the waiters - they serve you irrespective and some guests were embarrassing themselves with the tips left to ensure unempty glasses at the bar. I tipped one night + that was because the guy remembered my drink - big regret! The drink got stronger and stronger which spoilt it! YOU do not NEED TO! I could review forever so finally, get yourself to the beach you will not see sea like it!! although very busy! Saw pelicans and huge terradactyl type birds flying over! Get yourself to Playa del carmen - we walked - very pleasant around 30mins no problem. Oh! yes if you are flying Thomson.fly then ensure you get a taxi to the airport to ensure seats together on your return journey home - earlier you get to the airport the better. Do not rely on your Thomson reps getting you in time to request window seats! There were seats available on our flight only airport staff lied and told us there weren't and had to pay \u00a380 to sit together - be warned. A couple on our flight paid for first class and were down graded as they had over booked the 1st class. Overall, excellent winter sun desination - loved it barring dealing with the Reps who are only interested in booking trips and treating you like cattle - Big tip! - do it all yourself once you are there and you won't go far wrong!

Travellers need to decide what is the most important things about the hotels that is important, the Tequila isn't absolutely perfect, but it is a great hotel and a great time. Food: If you can't find something you like I have no idea why. We only ate at the buffets. The steak house serves 6 different styles of steak which we felt was not interesting to our family. We did try to book the mexican restaurant which is right on the beach but they only had 9 pm seatings left by the time we went to book it at 8:15 am. If you want a restaurant reservation, be at the lobby right at 7 am to book it. The buffets in the lobby and by the pool were different every day for lunch and dinner. There was huge selection - fruit, veggies, salads, cheeses, steak, pork, chicken and fish at every meal, always prepared differently, Mexican (real Mexican, not americanized Mexican) at least 6 different kinds of muffins, 6 more breads, fresh made donuts, pancakes, omletes and on and on, even plain hamburgers and hot dogs which made my 10year old happy. Pool: awesome, we walked through the Playacar and Palace (we werent' supposed to be on Palace grounds but took a walk through anyway) and the Tequila has by far the best pool area. If it is important to you, the pool could use a coat of paint on the bottom, but I certainly didnt' judge my holiday by that. The two pools are separated by the restaurant/bar, one side has a swim up bar and the other side is where games are played so you can choose the quieter drinking side or the party side. There jacuzzi is cement lounge chairs set in a sallower area of the pool. My daughter loved playing on those and using them as slides. By the pool is a large area with beach volley ball, two ping pong tables, bocce, darts, and the staff is amazing. They come and invite you constantly (without being annoying or pushy) to come and play any of the above games, also horse shoes, airrifles, stretching class, water aerobics, crazy games, dancing lessons etc, etc. My husband who was looking forward to sitting by the pool all week was up playing all the time at the different activities. When we walked through the other resorts we saw that their pool was just that - a pool- and nothing else near it. I'm not even sure if they had the other activities so we were very glad to be where we were. Near the pool is also a place where you can paint mexican pottery (for a fee), also there is a cart with book exchange if you run out of reading material. Staff: awesome, entertainment staff are absolutely the best, Shima was a waiter we looked for in Jalisco and he was awesome, some buffet staff weren't as good, so we stuck with the guy who was doing a great job and rewarded him accordingly. We never did take part in the kids club because there was so much to do without having to put them in the club. However, a little girl from England had her birthday when we were there whom my daughter had made friends with. The staff came over and got the birthday girl and her sister and some other girls whom they had made friends and threw her a birthday party in the kids club. My daughter was thrilled to attend her friends birthday party, and I'm sure it made the day special for the young lady. Rooms: Big, airy, not stuffy or moldy as some others complained about. Air conditioning worked awesome, I would have to turn it down after the room was cleaned as the steward always left it on high and I would come back to room that felt freezing cold. I would turn it down and the room was perfect day and night. Mini bar fridge restocked every two days or on request with no hesitation. Beds are hard, another opinion said you can get bed pads but we never asked because although the beds were considerably different than what we are used to, we found we slept well on them so didn't' worry about it. They brought a cot for my second child without me even having to ask for it so I didn't' have to deal with the kids fighting in bed at night too. Beach: Ha ! what beach? Stacks of chairs shoved together overlooking the 10 foot drop to the raging surf which pounds against the man made breakwaters. See pictures. If you want a beach, go north of town. The beach in playa del carmen was beautiful and we went there one day. this is not the place for you if you want to be in the salt water. I come from BC where every year we go and spend our summers on wide sandy beaches that go for miles, this is not the case at the Rui's. The beaches are much nicer north of town, or my friend stayed at Akumel Beach resort and said the beach was the most beautiful she had ever seen. We did side trips to Tulum and Coba, liked Coba better. Snorling at Yal-Ku lagoon (best part of the trip for all of us) and Xcaret (too much money) and I will post reviews of these places separately.", "Date": "February 4, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dunstable", "Title": "\u201cWe're going back!\u201d", "Author": "MidwifeSharan", "ReviewID": "UR13202577", "Content": "We stayed at this hotel just after the hurricaine in 2005, our friends who had booked to go a few days before us had their holiday cancelled because of it.

Flights A long 10hr 30min flight out, the leg room and in flight entertainment was ok. The flight home was a nightmare...our original flight home was cancelled and we had to stay another day. That flight was then detoured to the Domincan Republic...so not a good trip getting home. Weather.... hot, humid, cloudy, rainy. It is the rainy season so it was not all clear blue skies. Cloudy and by late afternoon the rain clouds came in.. and did it rain ! However, this did not stop us from doing anything or spoil the holiday. Hotel We were in room 2111..furthest point from reception. The room smelt damp would be the only complaint. It was big, cleaned every day and had everything we needed. One small point..you can hear \"everything\" going on in the rooms next to you ! The grounds are well kept, the pools are a bit cold when getting in but fine after that. We spent all our time in the pool with the pool side bar. You do have to join everyone else and get up at the crack of dawn if you want to get a pool side sun bed.. They will have to repaint the pool some time soon. Restaurants / Food / Drink The food was very good considering they are providing 3 meals a day for a lot of people. As someone else has mentioned..if you are looking for a la carte, do not go all inclusive. Food and drink was available 24hrs if you wanted it. You had to book the steak house option and this means joining a queue at 7am. We did this once and to be honest preferred the main restaurant. Staff Fantastic ! cheerful, helpful, hard working, polite...what more can you say. They work their socks off. Entertainment Lots to do if you want to get involved. There is a programme of events all day every day. In the evening the put on a show, we saw horror, crazy, mr & mrs and michael jackson. Up to about 9pm it is all children entertainment and then the days prize giving. The main show starts around 9:30 qnd lasts for about an hour. The main show is not brilliant but they are fun and entertaining and you cannot fault the staff for their commitment. Beach A bit of a walk for the lazy but a golf cart lift is available if you cannot be bothered with a 10 min walk. The beach is crowded and small due to it being eroded away, but we had no problems getting sunbeds. The sea was choppy with big waves when we visited but that added to the fun. Trips We only did chitchen itza, juan hell of a night and portadventura Chichen Itza is a 4hr coach journey either way so we decided to fly. It cost more but was well worth it and added to the overall trip. We were taken on a small 12 seater and it takes 45 mins to get there. Chichen Itza itself is also well worth the visit. Juan hell of a night is a trip into Cancun to visit some of the pubs/clubs and again I would recommend this. But beware, the pubs are loud and crowded..so might not be for the elderly travellers. Coco Bongos and Daddy Rock are great places. My girlfriend wanted to swim with dolphins so we did this trip ourselves and not with Thompsons. We jumped into a cab and went to Port Adventura. This is free to get in and you can walk around and be close to the dolphins, sea lions and manatees and watch the shows. You only pay when you want to swim the the dolphins.

The food was very good, with plenty of variety and our 4 year old had a lot of fun being up on stage after a day of rehearsal at the kid's club. It was an excellent visit, and the only critique I might have is that the water in the swimming pools (like many hotels in this area) was a little chilly for our taste (and our kids).

Staff are excellent and very attentive, ( especially Marco and Fhilipe on the bar, our glasses were never empty, they really looked after us.....). The hotel is clean, and rooms are serviced everyday, with free minibar, hairdryer etc. The grounds are stunning with staff constantly cleaning, gardening etc etc. Food is \"all inclusive\" what do you expect. They cant cater for everyone and somebody will always be disappointed. If you dont like buffet style in my opinion you dont go all inclusive. My boyfriend loved the food he put on at least a stone.... ha ha.... New Years Eve was stunning, with ice statues all over the restaurant, they made a real effort with Lamb, Duck, and Lobster on offer just to name a few. The pool - Dont try and get a sunbed after 8am as they are all reserved which is very annoying but i guess you will always get that wherever you go..... The beach is well... what can i say small but beautiful (damaged yes and still shrinking) the sea is gorgeous - (coming from a girl that normally hates the beach). The flight from the UK is horrid. Long and boring. I was exhausted when i arrived and being kept waiting at Cancun airport for 2hrs was not nice, but forget this when you arrive at Riu Tequila and start your holiday then. Anybody going with Thomson i recommend doing one trip.... The Platinum Cruise; at nearly $200 each it seems expensive, but well worth it. Best day out ever and swimming with dolphins is just WOW.

My son sometimes did not wanted to go to the beach, and stayed with the \"animadores\" instead, because there is plenty of entertaining activities for them.

Our family's experience at the Tequila was very positive. The staff were all very friendly and attentive. We found that the kinds of things that weren't great were due to the fact that it's a 3.5 star property. If you want a fancy room, 12 restaurants to choose from, and poolside drink service, go to a 5 star hotel. Be clear about what the star system means before you book, and you won't be disappointed. ROOMS In my opinion, the rooms aren't great. But they are what I expected, so the following is not a complaint -- I'm just giving you details. They aren't elegantly appointed, and our room was damp and musty -- no getting around it, the area is humid. Better ventilation and air conditioning would be helpful, but open your patio door and the place airs out pretty quickly. If the bed is too hard for you, ask for a mattress pad to be brought up, and they will do it promptly and with a smile. Our room was very clean, and we had no problems with dripping taps, overflowing toilets, mildew, or insects. Our sheets were not changed each day. I'm not sure if they ever were changed. Maybe you have to ask specifically for new sheets. It didn't bother us enough to ask. We fell into bed exhausted each night. The showers provided great water pressure and plentiful hot water. Just make sure you keep your mouth closed because the water in the rooms is not potable! **Use the bottled water in your mini-bar for brushing your teeth. They provide you with plenty of water and lots of other drinks in your mini-bar** The towels are in a horrific state, but then again, I didn't come to Mexico for the towels. Ah, no, I have to elaborate here. They're atrocious. When my towels start looking like this I donate them to the animal shelter. But I promise, that is as picky as I am going to get. As we were traveling with our children, we appreciated that the room had a privacy curtain that could be drawn between the main sleeping area and the bathing/dressing area. My son banged up his legs and hip when he slipped on the tile in the dressing area. Use caution when walking barefoot in the room. There is usually sufficient condensation on the floor to make it slippery -- you don't have to have just emerged from the shower. GROUNDS, POOL The grounds of the Tequila are impeccably maintained by a cheerful and hard working staff. We were constantly impressed by how hard everyone was working at this resort to ensure our comfort. The pool, sure, it could use some paint, but it was nice and refreshing, and skimmed for debris frequently. There are shallow areas for small children to play. The poolside area is lush and pretty and has comfortable padded loungers, many under umbrellas. Get there early if you want one, though, as certain folks don't abide by common courtesy, and will save chairs for themselves hours in advance. FOOD AND DRINK The breakfast and dinner buffets are large and provide a lot of variety. The omelette station is wonderful. After 10 days you might be wishing for something different, but hey, at least you don't have to cook it or clean it up. There is one other dinner restaurant on site that provides a nice 4 course meal, and you can go to a Mexican restaurant at one of the other Riu properties. Lunch is the same at all the Rius -- greasy and unhealthy -- hot dogs, hamburgers, fries, pizza, pasta in alfredo sauce, a few hot choices. If you want anything low fat, you will be pretty much living off the salad bar. Most dishes are fried in copious amounts of oil or covered with buttery sauces. Maybe this is right up your alley though. My kids were definitely impressed. We found the drinks were well made, no skimping at all. You have to ask specifically for top shelf liquors to be used in your drinks. There were lots of fun choices of non alcoholic drinks for our kids. A few so good that we ordered them \"con Smirnoff's\" ourselves! BEACH There's no beach at the Tequila, but it's a short walk or shuttle ride away. Get there early to get a chair. There's been lots of erosion of the beaches, but they are doing their best to deal with it. The water is no less warm and beautiful, the sun is no less sunny. ENTERTAINMENT The evening entertainment is all in good fun but it is not Vegas quality. My 8 and 12 year old boys enjoyed the \"Crazy Show\", but they got tired of watching dancing every other night. The Moulin Rouge show was slow paced and we all thought it was creepy. The other shows we saw were fun and colourful and had lots of energy. These shows all travel around through the area though, so this entertainment is not unique to the Tequila. We got what we expected from the Tequila. It was a clean, friendly resort that was reasonably priced. Nothing stood out for us about the hotel to ensure that we will come back, but we didn't have anything negative happen that would prevent us from returning, either.", "Date": "January 3, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "montr\u00e9al, qu\u00e9bec", "Title": "\u201cDisappointed by the Riu\u201d", "Author": "Datura1712", "ReviewID": "UR12278040", "Content": "Sorry to those who have booked this place expecting paradise, I strongly disagree. We were there Dec. 22-26 2007. We had landed in Cancun on the 15th and had stayed at Club Med in Cancun from the 15 to the 22 (see other review). Let's just say it doesn't compare and I will surely go back to Club Med, not so sure about Riu (at least this one). Room: in need of a major overall, both for decoration and efficiency (moldy spots on the ceiling of the shower stall, 2 side-by-side very hard double beds, with plastic covering making it feel like you're sleeping on potato chips). Positive point: extremely clean, thanks to Luis, who made different sculptures with towels every day, to our children's delight. Also: nice balloons put into the room on my daughter's birthday. VERY noisy - we heard every one of our neighbors (sideways and on the floor above) as they made their way to their room, some of them quite late and quite tipsy - one was certain our room was his and tried for a good 5 minutes to get it open at 3:30 AM... Pool: larger then we had first thought, seemed like a nice place to spend the day. Main restaurant: extremely large, thus noisy with a disturbing cafeteria feel to it. Food was ok, no more, though there was a large selection, certainly enough so that anyone can find something to their liking. Seemed to be cathering mostly to the german palate (most clients seemed to be from Germany, Austria or Holland). The clients were quiet in the restaurant (certainly not their fault if it was was too big and consequently very noisy), but many of them were, to my taste, way too casual (muscle shirt with printed off-colour \"jokes\" on them for the men, tattoos everywhere we could see for both sexes, original piercings for the women): not my favorite style, but to each is own. Excellent point: again, the staff were very nice. On our daugher's birthday, although I had not called ahead to inform them, once I did,during diner, our waiter was back about 10 minute later with 3 o4 other waiters and a cake, and they sang for her and serve cake for everyone. Remarkable service. Beach: I had read that there had been beach erosion, so that was not a surprise. What was was the \"peak of summer in southern France\" feel to the beach: about 10 rows deep of beach chairs, all installed close together (almost one on top of the other)... we walked from the one nearest to the Tequila to the Playacar. During our entire walk (Xmas morning, 10 am at the latest), We did not see one single lounger available.... although very few at people actually lying on them (which proved to be the case all day long). Because we did not find any space on the beach, we decided to try the pool at the Playacar. Again: not one single lounger available... finally, we settled on the last bistro table near the pool bar, with its 4 chairs, from where we navigated all day long. 1 hour of Xmas songs in the pool, blissfull... but all too quickly stopped, for no understandable reason, as no animation or other music replaced it. All in all, for the price we payed, it was all right, but certainly no better than that. The main positive aspect is that it gave us a great starting point from which to visit XCaret, Tulum and Puerto Aventuras (great dolphin swim there).", "Date": "January 2, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto", "Title": "\u201cLoved the hotel and the Mexican People\u201d", "Author": "Marajwana", "ReviewID": "UR12272022", "Content": "It was our first trip to Mexico and to an all inclusive with my wife and 2 kids, 7.5 and 2.

The champagne was flowing all night and the staff kept offering me more wherever I was. The Mayan dance show was incredible. Everything went so smooth like they do this every day. Beach: Prepare to walk for 800m (and please do as you will be eating so much, you will thank me for the walk). But you can also fight for a spot on the golf cart that goes back and forth. The weather was great (26C) and the water warmer than the pool, so we spent our mornings there. Also, the beach restaurant had a great lunch buffet.", "Date": "January 2, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wallasey, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Staff\u201d", "Author": "elmees1", "ReviewID": "UR12266799", "Content": "Having done some 8 holidays of this type now, apart from the older and newer properties I don't find a lot of difference between these resorts however the staff at this group of Riu's does excel itself and it was the best service we have experienced! Both food and bar service was excellent throughout, I mean where else can you walk into a busy bar at 11.50 p.m. on new years eve and have a drink in your hand 30 seconds later and then even be asked if you would like another one as your glass starts to empty. It was like that every night wether you tipped or not which brings me on to the next item, I am not a big tipper by any means and usually get made to feel like a cheapskate by our friends from across the Atlantic ocean because I usually tip 1 or 2 dollars a couple of times a night if I am happy with our treatment by the staff. We stayed at this resort for 7 nights and I only saw tips exchanging hands 4 times, 3 of these were on New Years Eve yet the service was second to none for everybody! Very unusual but the Riu do push the fact that their 24hour A/I. does include all taxes and gratuities and not one of the staff played for tips which was quite refreshing after some of the resorts we have visited and actually prompted me into flashing the cash a little more than usual! Apologies for this not being an in depth report but basically I can't find anything to complain about, sure the pool water is cold although if you go into the other pool on the other side of the snack bar it is about 5 degrees warmer, 32degrees celcius and people complain about the water being cold! Sure the beach is badly eroded but it's still one of the nicest beaches we've been on. Before I forget, New Years Eve! If we had been in similar surroundings and treated to the kind of gourmet food and then had a free bar for the rest of the night in any of our cities then I wouldn't expect to pay less than $1000 per head! Fresh salmon, smoked salmon, lobster, prawns, topside beef, pork, parma ham, gateaux, ice sculpures, champagne. I could go on all night, I have never seen so much food and drink. As youve probably gathered I quite liked this resort and the fact that you could take a nice stroll into Playa Del Carmen was a big plus as this type of resort is usually miles away from civilisation and you're stuck their till home time. I didn't really want to list any negatives in this review but! Yeah I suppose we can all find a but and I don't suppose I should have a go at people who think that the water was too cold, that was there but and after all that is what this site is all about, people giving their own opinions. My but may seem trivial to some people, I do enjoy my booze, always have done always will do but I stopped drinking full sugar drinks some 20 years ago. The Rius didn't offer any sugar free mixers diet 7 up, diet coke etc. They did have Pepsi light listed on their bar menu but just received giggles when asked for.

We took our family of 17 which included eight grandchildren, ages 6 months to 13. It was a great family time and very relaxing for everyone. We enjoyed the food, pools and beaches. Now, for the bad news. The second day of our trip it had rained that morning. As my husband and I were walking through the lobby around noon we both slipped. The floor near Thomsons desk had just been mopped and was very wet. My husband caught himself but I went down with a huge thud on my left side. To make a long story short, I fractured my left humerus just under the shoulder. The hotel sent a doctor and he took me to their clinic. A little more than a hairline fracture so I had to wear a sling and keep my arm immobile for the next six weeks. My message to you all is please be careful with the wet floors. We saw people slipping everyday. One lady from England slipped outside by the sports bar while it was raining and was knocked out for few moments. Our grandchildren were slipping and sliding in their bathrooms after their showers and had quite a few bumped heads. They use beautiful shiny tiles in these hotels that look nice but are very dangerous when wet. We were there during the rainy season and that does make it more probable to slip and fall. Also, while in line at the Cancun airport to come home, we met a family from California who had brought two grandmothers. They both had slipped at their hotel, not the Riu, and one broke her ankle, the other had a black eye and bruised face. One more thing. The pre-show of the Michael Jackson show was raunchy. The staff host called several men up on stage to act like Michael Jackson. Of course there was a lot of crotch grabbing going on as the men tried to imitate Michael in their little routines which was encouraged by the host. Our family felt very uncomfortable with all our grandchildren there watching this display of crudeness. You may be thinking, well this is an adult show, get over it. The hotel children\u2019s staff had children in the show. They had been practicing dance routines, etc. Our granddaughter was one of them. On a good note, we did enjoy the Mayan show. So....have a great time at the Riu, just watch your step! I still enjoyed my vacation with my broken arm, I just couldn't romp in the ocean and pools with my grandkids. We did enjoy Xcaret and eating fish tacos at Dr. Taco's in Playa Del Carmen.", "Date": "January 1, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sarnia, ON", "Title": "\u201cHad a fantastic time!\u201d", "Author": "MeganG27", "ReviewID": "UR12047473", "Content": "A group of girlfriends and I travelled to the Mayan for 7 days in April 2007. We had a terrific time at the Riu Tequila!! Check-in: When we arrived at the hotel, our rooms were not ready as it was the middle of the day. They kept our luggage in the lobby area (which wasnt really the best arrangement) so we had access to it if we wanted to hit the beach or head to the pool. Our group director greeted us with a cocktail and went over the layout of the hotel and general information. The only problem was that we had to keep checking in at the front desk to see if our rooms were ready. Rooms: The room was very nice, with a garden view. The double beds were pushed together, so would have to be moved if there were more than two people in one room. We did have some problems with mosquitos in our room but requested that the staff spray it regularly for us, which they did. The room was also quite damp at night and sometimes made for an uncomfortable sleep. The room included four bottles of unknown booze, but booze none-the-less. There was also pop, water, and beer in the fridge. Pools: Both pools were nice, although the swim-up bar pool was a little dirty. We often went over the the Riu Playacar across the street to their swim-up bar as it was small and therefore a little more friendly. The pool at Riu Yucatan was also nice, although very crowded around the bar. Beach: The beach was across the street from Tequila at the Riu Yucatan and about a 5 min. walk. You could also take the shuttle, however, we didn't want to seem lazy so walked each time! The beach was very crowded and many of the loungers were in the shade. If we wanted any tan, we had to arrange the chairs in the sun and sometimes bring them right up to the water, which was OK because it was very hot. There were not alot of locals selling things on the beach so you were rarely bothered. It was nice and sandy and there was certainly room to walk down the beach, although at times, it was rocky and you had to go around. A couple of times we walked from Yucatan to Playacar rather than walking back up to the road and around. Food: The food was very good but repetative. Breakfast was a huge buffet with pretty much anything you could imagine, so there was a great variety. There were two restaurants for lunch which both had basically the same stuff; salads, fruits and veg, burgers and nachos, etc. The a la carte restaurant at Tequila was the Steakhouse and was very tasty, but had a small menu. The other a la carte was located at Riu Yucatan across the street and had Mexican food. It was excellent! Entertainment: The daily and nightly entertainment was great. The Animacion staff was probably the best part of the stay. I am a big joiner, so loved doing most of the activities; aqua aerobics, dance lessons, pool olympics, beer drinking contests, etc. The staff was very friendly and always remembered you. If you are not into activities, though, you may find them very pushy as they really try and get you to go. At night, there was always some sort of music show. My favourite was the Michael Jackson show! What a good time! The staff would also come and join your tables during the show and chat with you....so nice. Keep an eye out for Hector, Louis, Stitch, Aidan, and James....they will make sure you have a great time! Bars: There was a swim-up bar, a lobby bar, a bar by the stage, and a sports bar. The sports bar had many arcade games and table games as well as food in the fridge if you wanted a late night snack. There was also the dance bar, La Piniata. It played all the popular dance music and was open late. It is small in there and would get really crowded and sweaty...but we didnt care! Kids Activities: Although we were five single girls, we did notice the kids running around. There was a Kids Club at the hotel and the staff was great with them. They would also include them in the early part of the evening show and they all seemed to be having a great time. Day Trips: Although day trips were available, they were quite pricey. I have been to Mexico before and would recommend the trip to Xel-Ha (sp?). It is the activity park where you can swim with the dolphins, go snorkelling and scuba diving, ride the lazy river, jump off cliffs, everything. It is also very family-friendly. Overall, we had a wonderful trip and I would definately go back there. It was such a fun and relaxing trip and not too pricey for what you get.

I have to say we were very very happy with our experience at this resort. But first.... If you are a first time traveller to Mexico beware of the people who are at the exit of the airport. There were about a dozen uniformed people who led us to believe they were there to help orient us and get us onto the right bus for transport to our hotel. After 30 hours without sleep we were rather slow on the uptake. They managed to convince us that we should leave a $50 deposit to get two free tickets to an excursion of our choice. Needless to say we were sucked into the timeshare vortex. The next day we were picked up and hustled off to the timeshare. Be wary of anything related to the Grand Mayan or the Grupo Mayan Resorts - they have a very slick sales gimmick and don't appear to be concerned about lying and cheating to get you hooked. If you need more info, email me. I knew to be wary of the timeshare people at various hotels, but not at the airport - so live and learn I guess. It was a lousy experience which left us with a bad taste on our first day there. As for the Riu Tequila - I think what struck me the most was how friendly and happy the staff were. Everywhere you went there were smiles, greetings, and an eagerness to serve that I've seldom expereienced in our own town (a tourist destination itself). The beds are a bit hard, but easy to get used to. The rooms are older and in need of a refresh, they are a bit damp, but you're in a tropical climate so that's to be expected. Air conditioning and fan worked fine. The hotel staff are constantly cleaning so everything appeared spotless. Food - awesome. So much choice and so little time :-) The only thing we found was that the beef cuts tended to be tough. Everything else was delightful. Drinks - friendly bartenders, great drinks. Not watered down. Good wine. Beach - the only downside to this hotel. The beach is available by short walk or shuttle every 5 minutes or so. However, the beach is very eroded due to a hurricane. They are presently trying to enlarge the beach area again by installing breakers. It's working slowly, but if you're expecting miles of white sand this isn't the hotel for you. Shopping - a small touristy mall a few minutes away. Lovely shops and friendly people. If you want to haggle - take the $5 taxi to Playa del Carmen. Excursions - lots to choose from. If you don't prebook there are tour operators every day at the hotel. They are safe to book through and appear to have standard prices. Xcaret is a $12 taxi ride away and you don't need to book a tour. Highly recommend you spend at least a day at this eco-park. Taxis - have standard fares. No haggling, but make sure you agree on the price before you get in. You never know.... Area - Playacar - a \"segregated\" community of resorts and upscale homes. They have their own security and the area is very safe.

This year we tried the Riu Tequila, which is just across the street and down the road a bit from the Royal Hideaway. We found the check in process to be a bit too hurried...perhaps they had a busload of tourists coming in (there are a lot of them), but the person checking us in seemed rushed to get us our keys and explain the dining and other things to us. We felt the dining part of it could be explained better by having some pre-printed sheets done up in several languages...this way they could just hand these out, rather than having someone go over everything verbally with you when you check in. As for facilities, the hotel is across the street from the beach, so if that's a deal-killer for you, go somewhere else. But the location to us was nice, as the beach is very close, and the shuttle runs very often to either take you or bring you back. The beach was nice, but a bit crowded, and we only went to the beach for one day...the rest of our time we spent by the pool at the Riu Tequila, which was quite nice, as they have a buffet and bar right there. We only ate at the steak restaurant one night (there are two places you can make reservations at, the steak one and the Mexican one down by the beach); one thing we both noticed was that dinner seemed very \"regimented\"...we sat for the first seating at 7, and they want things to run quickly so that they can get out fed and out of there in time to clean up and welcome in the next seating at 9. We preferred to eat buffet while we were there, and the food was very good there. We even preferred this at night, for dinner, as they had a lot of good food, and it was just so much easier to not have to worry about being someplace at a certain time. With the buffet, you go when you're ready, and we really liked that. A couple things we didn't care for at the Riu Tequila...first, our room had that \"odor\" that you read so much about here. Hopefully when (and IF) they ever re-do the rooms (and they are badly in need of it!), they will also take some time to clean and disinfect their air conditioners. I think the \"musty/mildewy\" odors come from the air conditioners, because of the humid climate and the heat, the a/c runs all the time. And if they're not keeping the condensing units clean, these odors pop up. Our room was quite smelly, and if we had it to do all over again I would have requested another room...but who knows, most rooms there may have this issue. The other thing that kind of put us off a bit was some of the attitudes we ran in to by the staff there...when we made reservations for dinner at the steak restaurant, we were told \"Don't be late.\"...how's that for customer service! The sports bar we went in to once and didn't go again, it was very slow, as was the service. We never made it to the discoteque. The bar areas all seemed very nice, esp. the one near the lobby. Gerardo makes a mean Jim Beam and 7! Overall, we had a nice stay at the Riu Tequila, and as my heading alludes to, we felt we got our money's worth there. Not a place that you'll be talking about for years, but a place you can go and have a nice vacation at for a decent price...good food and good drinks! We would consider going back again, but may try another place the next time we go back to Playa Del Carmen. The area continues to grow, and is becoming more commercialized.

Rooms do have a described smell, but that smell is everywhere in Mexico and it is a minor issue. We had no problem with mosquitos at all.

They have a small stand at the Playacar's market place which is 2 minute walk from Riu Tequila (across Riu Playacar). The tour was great. Highly recommended. They make a stop at a shoping place on a way to Chichen Itza. Do not shop there. The prices are much higher than those in Chichen Itza. They do not have anything unique either.

Something I had read others did not experience (maybe if they had given the bellman a tip when he took their luggage from the van they would have gotten better service- HELLO - all inclusive does not mean being STINGY). Don't believe the negative reviews about musty smells, this is the jungle...which means humidity. Don't buy into the Jalisco buffet being boring...quite the opposite, I had a different meal at breakfast, lunch, and dinner (hello, they had Polish stuffed cabbage (read: GOLUMPKI) for crying out loud). The food preparation was amazing!!! We reserved one night for the La Lupita...WOW, unbelievable presentation, high quality delivery, and we left with satisfied stomachs (two of us are chefs, so we should know). About the staff of all the Riu's...hardworking! I noticed that the Europeans hardly tipped the staff...rather rude. We tipped (although not necessary) every time we felt we were getting perfect service, which was about every time. The beds are a bit hard, but I slept like a baby and anyway...are you going to Playa del Carmen to sleep? Then do it by the pool. We never had trouble getting a pool lounger and there were six of us. We never had trouble finding a lounger by the beach either, but then again we walked the beach and only sat long enough to finish our cocktails and then go out parasailing. The activities will keep you on your toes if you are the active type like our group. We went zip lining, swimming in Mayan cenotes, visited post classic Mayan cities (Chichen Itza), got seaside massages (Theresa is a massage Goddess!!), and took long walks enjoying the beauty of Quintana Roo, Mexico! We plan on coming back in 5 years due to the recent unearthed findings at Chichen Itza, and plan on staying at the Tequila!!! Oh, they offer top shelf liquors, but you have to ask. We hardly used the liquor in our rooms...we did drink the Coronas and there was ample water available. We thought the Absolute Currant Martini and the Espresso Martini the best. I am a lover of nature and got plenty of it with the free roaming White Nosed Coati's, Iguanas, and Central American Agouti's running around. You will also find a troop of feral cats, one of which looked like it got into a fight with one of the coati. I love cats, but know you can't feel bad, this is nature and it is a constant fight over food. Our friends did see Toucans at the pool, I missed it, but did not miss their call at 6 am in the morning. The birds wok e me up every morning...kind of nice to wake up to them instead of an alarm clock. Denice our housemaid while there made fabulous towel creations every day for us. Again, though not needed, leaving two dollars a day for the person making your bed will ensure you will be taken care of for your entire stay. On our last day leaving I gave her ten just to show her how much we appreciated her hard work. Something you may want to know about the staff, they sometimes work 6 to 7 days a week and it is not their only roll at the resort. Some of the performers from the nightly shows we saw working in different capacity around the resort. I saw one of the dancers organizing a volley ball game. I respect hard working people and honor they are allowing me to enjoy myself. Oh, we enjoyed the nightly shows. The six of us would meet at the bar closest to the sports bar and watch the shows. They had Grease, Horror Night, Dances from other cultures...we missed the Micheal Jackson thing...non of us care for him and don't think we missed much. If you want to do some shopping take a taxi to 5th Avenue (costs 5 US dollars) and there are all kinds of great deals to be found. I am used to Central and South American shopping, if you don't want to go into a shop (because the sales person is beconning you) then don't...what's the big deal, this is how they sell stuff...so it's not your home town, have respect for theirs and leave your judgments at home. We found fantastic 5 star wine restaurants there, you have to walk several blocks away from 5th Avenue to get there-do it, it is a great adventure.

I chose this hotel because all the reviews on TripAdvisor were saying that it was a great hotel. No The Truth!! It should Not be given more than 1 star. The staff were not helpful, the food was horrible, the rooms were the worst, it is not all inclusive, It Is Not On The Beach, etc. Let me begin by saying that the \"king\" bed was two full sized beds pushed together. You couldn't sleep in the middle because the beds would seperate. The beds were 6 inches thick; very uncomfortable. The food was terrible! My husband and I were sick the entire night after eating there as well as the second night. The drinks were watered down. We had to eat out the entire time because we were too afraid. The shower was big enough for one person but barely. The hotel is Not located on the beach. You have to walk more than a mile to get to the very narrow crowded beach. It is not a private beach; many locals walking around trying to sell you things making it unsafe to leave your things unattended. The staff were more concerned with making things easier for them and did not care about our needs. We arrived at 2pm on a Thursday, they told we had to make reservations for dinner. When we tried to make them they said we had to do them in the morning. I informed them that we had just arrived and they did not care. The tour trips were not included so my husband and I spent a lot of money to stay away from this terrible hotel.

Here is our review of the main aspects: FLIGHT The flight with Thomson Fly was fine and we left on time. The cabin crew were friendly and helpful. There is plenty of leg room and the seats are comfortable. You are given a free pack when you get on containing a blanket etc. Remember to take this with you when you get off as otherwise you will have to pay for another one on the return journey. ARRIVAL Following the short transfer by coach, we arrived at the hotel and were greeted by friendly faces and given a refreshing drink. We were then shown to our room and our cases followed shortly after. HOTEL Overall the hotel is beautiful especially the grounds and the reception area. All areas are kept extremely clean and we didn\u2019t have any complaints. ROOM When we first entered our room we were a bit shocked by the awful green colour on the walls and there was a slight damp smell. However the room was extremely clean so we felt quite happy. The beds are slightly hard but we didn\u2019t mind this and soon got used to them. Our fridge was always well stocked with water, Pepsi, Fanta and Corona. There was also a mini bar but we didn\u2019t use this. Our room was cleaned everyday to the highest standard and we were always left a lovely towel are creation. Overall we were happy with our room but they definitely need updating. POOL When you first get in the pool it feels very cold but you soon get used to this and on really hot days it is such a relief to jump in to. The pool surroundings are lovely with plenty of umbrellas and trees for shade. There are signs up saying that you are not supposed to reserve the sun loungers but everyone still does it so if you want a good spot you need to get up early. The bottom of the pool could do with re-surfacing but every effort is made to keep it clean. THE BEACH The beach is about a 5 minute walk away from the hotel entrance or you can take the free buggy that runs back and forth all day. When we first walked down to the beach we were quite shocked by the erosion that has caused damage to the beach. There is a sheer drop that you have to jump down and once there the actual beach is very narrow. Saying that it is still lovely and you can walk for quite a way in both directions. We did not spend much time at the beach but friends that we met spent a few days there nearer the Riu Playacar and they said it was fine. ENTERTAINMENT The entertainment staff work extremely hard all day and night. The daytime activities start from 10.30 and everyone is made welcome. You can play French bowls, rifle shooting and even Bingo. At nighttime the shows that are put on are excellent. We especially enjoyed the Michael Jackson show, Greece and the Comedy Show. We did venture to the disco a couple of nights but it is extremely dark in there and the music isn't great. FOOD The food was superb and the best I have experienced at any all inclusive. There is so much to choose from especially at breakfast. I had an omelette most mornings and they were delicious! Lunchtimes you can choose from pasta, salad, pizza, burgers, hot dogs and other cooked meals. Dinner is also superb with lots of choice. One night there were fresh tiger prawns being cooked and they were to die for. We also ate at the Steak Restaurant on two occasions and both were very nice. EXCURSIONS We went to Dolphin Discovery to do the Royal Swim which was an experience of a lifetime and also went on a Formula speed boat which was superb and I would highly recommend if you are a thrill seeker. Both these trips were booked through our Thomson rep. Overall we had an excellent holiday at the Riu Tequila and would definitely return.", "Date": "November 28, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "West Midlands", "Title": "\u201cExcellent holiday!\u201d", "Author": "KazbahWestMidlands", "ReviewID": "UR11101289", "Content": "Date: 08 Nov - 22 Nov 07 Reviewer: Sedgley Fans - UK I was somewhat concerned about some of the reviews that I'd read regarding this hotel, but me and my hubby thought it was great. We've only just got back and we had a brillant time. The flight with Thomsons was good - excellent leg room and in flight entertainment. No hold ups at Cancun airport, smooth transfer to the Riu Tequila. Upon arrival the check in was very well organised with all the room keys available straight away and a welcome drink. Our luggage arrived at our room within 10 minutes of us. Yes when we first went into the room it was musty but the next day the musty smell had gone and the cleaners did an excellent job - definitley no issues there. Yes I agree the beds were a little hard but personally that suits me. The hotel grounds were very well maintained and all the staff were extremely friendly, everyone would greet you with \"hola\". Regarding the food I can't imagine what people could grumble about, there was an excellent choice and we never had one bad meal at any restaurant. The range of drinks was excellent and the bar staff very hard working, we've been to a few caribbean islands and comparing the service between them and Mexico this was second to none. The entertainment was ok, but what do you expect for free, I've seen a lot worse entertainment and they do the best that they can.

Most were good; some were terrible. Overall, however, the good reviews win. This is a nice hotel, not luxurious, but certainly not shabby. We traveled with our 17yr old and 19 yr. old. We could not get rooms close by, even though we had requested that a week prior to arriving. But since our kids were older, they were more than happy to be a distance from us. The rooms were clean. The kids' room had some ants, but as one review suggested that we bring ant traps, that problem did not last long. Our room was a smoking room, but as we also read that we should bring air fresheners, that too did not last long. the rooms are musty; there is not cure for that. It is the setting, not the hotel. The beds are hard, but I slept really well as I like a solid mattress. You can get mattress pads to soften the bed up. Pool was very clean; but the beach had a lot of erosion. Much better beaches in Playa del Carmen. The food was good, not great. Breakfast was the best; lunch was OK, good hamburgers, hot dogs, good pizza. Great guacamole and pica de gallo. Other hot items were OK but not great. Also can make salads. Dinner was pretty much the same with a few changes. Had dinner one night at the steak house. Don't bother. Yes, you can sit down and order an entree, but other than that it is production line; everyone gets served at the same time. My son and I ordered ribeye medium rare, it came well done. The steaks are very thin so medium rare would have been difficult. We only had 2 dinners at the hotel, but that was our plan anyway. Drinks are OK, not top shelf, but the bar by the pool is the best; Internet access in the sports bar is good, but costly. $5.50 US for 1/2 hour. You can use their computers or plug in your own laptop if you want. All in all, would recommend but would not stay there again, only because I do not think we would do an all-inclusive again.

This was our first trip without kids. Everything was smooth with the flight. The transfer from the airport to the hotel was very slow. Apparently, some people decided to take their time getting off the plane and out to the parking lot. We arrived at the hotel about noon and we had our room by 2 pm. We had a few drinks and a bite and we then proceeded to the beach. The beach has been badly damaged by Hurricane Dean. There are places where there are 6-7 foot drops and while we were there somebody was lugged off in an ambulance with a busted ankle or foot. There is still lots of room butyou have to move your chairs around quite a bit if u want to sunbathe. The service at the Tequila was very good. Bar staff are exceptional. I only met one grumpy bartender the whole time on the beach side but the service at the Tequila was awesome!!! Patricia served us mostly at the pool bar. She is very friendly and wil never let your glass go empty. The food is good..not outstanding but the speciality restaurants are very good. We ate ribeye steak twice and it was awesome. Our room was ok. I didn't like the 2 beds pushed together but it was not that bad. Our neighbour was always getting locked out of her room and she would curse and swear at 3 in the morning so that was a bit of a nuisance. The shows to me were very average. The sound was terrible.

Booked the hotel after reading many reviews (mainly from trip.adviser!!) and have found that they mostly give a fair review. Here are my thoughts. Journey there was OK, it is a long flight but the cabin crew were pretty good. After a bit of a queue after baggage claim, the transfer to the hotel was good but be aware that the Thomson reps are not inside the airport waiting for you, so make sure you just keep walking past all the timeshare and other sharks inside the building. Check in was brilliant, with the room keys, wrist bands and drinks handed over on arrival, leaving you to fill out the form later on. The cases were sent to the rooms separately (took a while but they got there in the end) and we were soon exploring the hotel. People are right when they comment that some of the areas are a bit tired, but its not really that bad and is always kept immaculately clean by all the staff who work non-stop to keep the place looking good. Have to agree with those who comment on the hardness of the beds but it is possible to get used to them. The bar staff at all of the bars were brilliant, even at busy times they made every effort to make sure that no-one waited too long for drinks, sometimes serving 2 or 3 customers at a time. The drinks also were excellent and they were quite willing to make concoctions that were not on the menu. The food was very good, with enough different things every meal time to suit all tastes. I find one of the previous reviews on here about going to MacDs hard to believe, they must really be the most picky people on the planet!! The 2 special restaurants were OK, it was nice to be served rather than walk around with the food, but because they don't change the menus there is not much point in going back to them too often unless you really like them. The pool area is very nice but the pool itself could do with a revamp as the lining is damaged in quite a few places, but again every effort is made to keep it clean. It was a bit chilly though and the swim up bar was nearly always in the shade so didn't really get much trade. Never had a problem getting a sunbed but be aware that the sun goes down very early this time of year so if you choose the 'wrong' side you might be in shade for most of the day. Did a couple of trips and they were both very good especially the platinum cruise to swim with the dolphins, a really great day out for about \u00a390 each. There was some discussion that the reps were trying to make money out of the Excaret tickets but I can confirm that they were selling them for the same price as Excaret itself ($99 for the ExcaretPlus ticket). The trips generally were a bit expensive (IMHO) but nearly everyone who went on one enjoyed themselves. Went to the 2 other Riu s that we could (Yucatan and Playacar) and they both looked OK but the beach at the Yucatan has nearly gone, with a large drop down into the sea. It was also a bit dangerous as on one day a tree just fell into the water without warning. This was very near to the 'Wedding' area but I don't know if it affected anyone's wedding or not, but it did leave a big hole in the beach. The beach at the Playacar was nicer but very crowded, but I couldn't recomend either hotel for a beach holiday. The beach did look better at a few of the other hotels along this stretch but it does appear as though they are having problems keeping the beach in good shape. The shows were good fun although it is a bit bizarre to be cheering and clapping someone miming songs from Grease on a stage. The dancing shows were better, and the Mexican singing band were very good. Its not the Palladium but if you get in the spirit of the thing you will enjoy yourself. For the money this was really an excellent holiday. The only downside is the fact that the sun goes down so early (about 4.30) so it makes the days a bit short. Maybe we should ask them not to put their clocks back!!

The weather is perfect this time of year as it's not too hot and the occasional rain showers only last a few minutes. The staff at this hotel are great and the service in the bars and restaurants is very good indeed. I know the staff are on really low wages so they really appreciate the odd couple of dollars tip in return for friendly and efficient service. The food in the hotel is very good and we never had any reason to complain about anything. There's always a large selection to choose from and your wine glass gets filled by the waiter when needed. Food and drinks are available 24 hours a day at the sports bar next to the night club. The animation team made our holiday memorable more than anything. We always enjoy the activities during the day and find it's the best way to make friends with the other guests. Amazingly, even though they have hundreds of guests going through the hotel, the animation team seem to have a knack of remembering guest names which makes one feel quite special. Now for the not-so-good bits! The hotel is 11 years old now and its well overdue a refurb. The guest rooms and the pool area in particular are in a pretty shabby condition. When we arrived and checked into our room, the shower cubicle and dressing area were in very poor decorative order. Consequently, I complained to the front desk and they gave us an alternative room which was marginally better than the first. Both of the main pools are in a pretty poor state with the paintwork and tiling in need of a complete overhaul. However, these small problems were of no real concern to us and on balance, the Tequila gave us an amazing holiday and was excellent value for money.

The pools are beautiful and the grounds are very clean. We had lots of fun at the evening shows and the bars drinks were good and you didn't have to wait too long even during busy times.

The water is a beautiful teal blue but the beach itself is lengthy yet quite eroded limiting the amount of beach access. Playa de Carmen is a 30 min walk or $5 cab ride where you can find lots of souvenirs, nightlife and beaches. Now for the bad stuff, our room was disappointing. The first morning we woke up with the toilet overflowing flooding the bathroom (gross). The room we were moved to had a very moldy ceiling over the shower and the bed spread had a burn hole in it.

And before I start my review, I want to mention that the Apple Rep at the Tequila was only available for about 1 \u00bd hr per day. We found notes in our door 3 times saying that we had to meet him to arrange our departure time. Each visit with this rep was at noon, not a convient time at all. All he did was try to sell us tours, and each time he said he hadn\u2019t figured out what our departure time was. We finally did finalize our departure the day before we left. I plan on complaining to Apple about this guy. We started out on our trip by wearing my new TA T-Shirt hoping to meet other TA\u2019ers during our travel. I was only approached by only one other TA\u2019er at the Dulles Airport which was kind of cool. Once we arrived at the Cancun Airport, the lines were long getting through Customs. There were a lot more people getting red lights this time. Once out of the Airport, we found our Apple transportation. We were grouped with other RIU people so it was a direct shot to our hotel. We arrived at the Tequila at 11am and were greeted with a welcome drink. While checking in, I reminded the desk clerk of my room request that I had emailed to them 2 weeks prior. I initially was told that we could have a first floor room at 3pm. I\u2019m not sure if my TA T-shirt had anything to do with it, but suddenly a 2nd floor room, pool view, in block 900 became available, (which is what I requested), and we were in our room 20 minutes later. I\u2019m not sure if this was ever addressed before, but there are no pool view rooms at this hotel. There is tons of vegetation blocking the view. As mentioned in previous reviews, the rooms are outdated. The beds were extremely hard which I expected, but on the way to the check out the beach, we stopped at the desk and asked for mattress pads, which were on our beds upon our return to the room. The grounds at the Tequila were beautifully kept and were especially beautiful at night. All of the bars are very large, as opposed to the other RIU resorts. Service was very fast whether you tipped or not, (but please tip them!), and I did not find any of the drinks watered down. The sports bar has at least 10 televisions with different games, including golf, soccer, college & NFL football on at all times. There is nachos, fruit and sandwiches available 24/7. It also has computers which you can buy internet time for $3.50 per 30 minutes. For a small fee you can also play air hockey and pool. The sports bar does get pretty crowded on Saturday and Sunday during the football games, so if you want a seat to watch the game, get there early. I only managed to stay up late for the disco, which opens at around 11:30pm, only one night. It was very small, smoky and played Techno music which I don\u2019t care for, so we left after about 15 minutes. The buffet restaurant for breakfast and dinner is in the lobby area. Breakfast offers many choices but is about the same everyday and is very good. There is even a fresh juice bar with about 8 different juices. The dinner buffet is also very good and they change some the choices every night. There are plenty of options for dinner, and no one should go hungry. We ate twice at the Steak house which is a five course dinner. You start with a Caesar salad, then an appetizer which consists of onion rings, chicken wings, fried mushrooms and cauliflower. Next comes a creamed soup which is half tomato and the other half is something green, (can\u2019t remember what veggie it was). The others I sat with said it was very good, but I didn\u2019t try it. Choices for the main course consisted of Sirloin and Rib Eye steaks, BBQ ribs, chicken or flank steak and shrimp kabobs. The steaks were very good, and the one person I was with really liked the kabobs. Desert was Baked Alaska, which they made a show of lighting the topping on fire. Lunch is served at the restaurant between the pools. There is not a ton of choices, but it does include a salad bar, small pasta station, and some hot foods. There are also hot dogs, hamburgers and French fries. The hamburgers were sitting in grease and the rolls for the hot dogs were hard and crusty, (just not what I am used to). I usually just had a salad. As a warning, do not leave your plate alone on the table, or the birds will have a feast with your plate! I found that the lunch at the Playacar was best as it had different choices than the Yucantan/Tequila. They had really good fried chicken and chili. The pools at the Tequila were very cold. I managed to get in a couple of times. I don\u2019t think it was just me, as most people stayed in there chairs, which there was no problem getting most of the time. Temps during the day was in the low to mid 80\u2019s. I did spend most of the day at the beach as the ocean was much warmer. I was disappointed in the animation team, but this is my first trip to the Rivera Maya and I think I was expecting it to be like in Cancun. In Cancun the animation team stays at the pool playing fun games and music all day, where in the RM they have room to roam. At any given time they have beach volley ball, bocce ball, rifle shooting & ping pong tournaments going on, so they are not entertaining the people at the pool. It would have been nice if they at least played music. And speaking of music, it was non-existent at all the bars also, which would have added fun. After dinner there really wasn\u2019t much to do while waiting for the show to begin. All of the shows were really good, but we really enjoyed the Michael Jackson and Grease shows. On about the third night we decided to bar hop through all the other RIU resorts. Both the Yucatan and the Playacar have live music before and after the shows, which was a lot of fun. I picked the Tequila for the \u2018night life\u2019, but apparently it was at the other resorts other than the Tequila. Now about the beaches. I have read the reviews and forums avidly for the past year, and I was prepared for a depleted beach. At the Yucatan it was a lot worse than I expected. Although the beach is very long, there is only one maybe two rows of un-shaded beach. You cannot even drag a chair into the sun as the loungers are packed in like sardines. There is a good 3 foot drop to the water, and one of the palm trees had fallen into the water while we were there. I talked to a couple that had been there in April and they said it was much worse now. The Palace, which is directly to the left of the Yucatan, also has the same type of beach, except there are large rocks at the bottom of the 3 foot drop. Next to the Palace is the Wyndham, (which I didn\u2019t know was there! I expected it to be the Playacar as I assumed all the RIU Resorts to be next to each other). The Wyndham also had beach problems but they were pumping sand onto there beach. The Playacar beach was the nicest of all the RIU beaches. There was plenty of area to sun in or to have shade. There was no large drop off and they had a nice slope into the water. To the very left of the beach it was a little rocky and sea-weedy but I think its because it is where the jet skis come in and out all day. The staff at the Playacar would come around with trays of beer and soda to the loungers at the beach, which was an unexpected pleasure. There was a security guard on the beach. When two people from the Wyndham were walking through the Playacar beach, they were promptly approached and left right away. Also there are people that walk up and down the beaches selling jewelry and sunglasses. I bought three sets of beads with matching ankle bracelets for $20.00, as that was all the money I had on me. The vendor told me that she would give me a 4th set for free if I got her a couple of burgers from the lunch buffet. I wasn\u2019t risking stealing food for her, (as bad as I felt), because of the guard. So maybe that\u2019s why he was there. I have to say that each of the RIU Resorts were special in there own way and offered different amentias. I thought the facilities at the Tequila were the best and was very glad I chose it as a home base. The beach and services were awesome at the Playacar, and I would call it a step, as far as class, above the others. I am not sure why we can\u2019t use the ala-carts at the Playacar, as they are interchangeable at the Yucatan and the Tequila. I would have liked to tried there Asian restaurant. The staff and live music at both the Yucatan and Playacar, especially at the Yucatan at night, had the fun factor the Tequila was missing. During my stay at the Tequila there were no power outages, even though I came prepared with flashlights and candles. I was not bitten by one mosquito or bug at the resorts. Each morning the skies were bright and blue, but by 1pm the clouds would start appearing with intermittent sun. The evenings were cool and a light sweater or jacket was needed. We took a taxi into PDC one afternoon for $5.00 and a tip. We hit Senor Frog\u2019s, which is on the beach right next to the ferry area. Its a lot smaller and is an open area bar as compared to the one in Cancun. The music was blasting and was a lot of fun. Carlos & Charlie\u2019s across the street was also hopping. We also went to the Tequila Barrel and the Blue Parrot. Skip the Tequila Barrel; it looks better on the web cam. I was going to shop on 5th Ave, but I didn\u2019t feel like being hassled with the bargaining, so I went to Wal-Mart. Wal-Mart does not offer many souvenirs, but does have cheaper cigarettes and liquor than the airport. Before I left home, I checked into using the collectivo on TA. Just take a taxi into the PDC and catch one in the direction you\u2019re going. Easier said than done. We told the taxi driver we wanted to go to Xel-ha via collectivo. He dropped us off near the bus station and told us to get one there. Well, we saw some, but they were going to Cancun. We asked a passer by and they told us to go down about 3 blocks to catch the collectivo towards Tulum. We sorta stood on a corner looking around, when a driver of a collectivo spotted us carrying our snorkel equipment and asked if we needed a ride. I think he must have felt sorry for us because we kept crossing the streets checking out all the white vans to see if it was a collectivo. I am really happy he came up to us at that point, because my hubby was getting upset. Finally we made it to Xel-ha. The all inclusive price jumped from $59.00 to $75.00 beginning Nov 1st. The food there looks a lot better than it tastes. This was my first attempt at snorkeling, which was hilarious to a lot of people around me LOL! First of all, remember to connect the straps of your vest between your legs, or it will come up around your head when you get in the water. Don\u2019t walk in flippers first, you don\u2019t very far. Also, most important breath in and out of your snorkel, the dang nose thing don\u2019t work at all! I swallowed lots of very salty water before I learned, but once I got it down it was really amazing. Just like swimming in a large aquarium. Lots of critters walking around Xel-ha, and that includes many mosquitos so bring your bug spray with Deet. A nice day, but I think that for the price we paid, the pass should have been good for 2 days. To get back to the PDC, there were scheduled ADO busses leaving directly from Xel-ha. It was $4.00 pp and was air conditioned and had three televisions. All in all we had a wonderful vacation! I would recommend the RIU Resorts as a whole instead of separating them into the individual facilities. If you book one, you booked them all and that\u2019s how we used them. I cannot really say that one is better than the other, but if I really had to chose one, I think I would have to pick the Playacar if the price is good. Otherwise just pick one, matters not really because RIU is an awesome resort.", "Date": "November 13, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "england", "Title": "\u201cloved it !!\u201d", "Author": "sunnihunni", "ReviewID": "UR10618264", "Content": "best hotel i have eva been to i have been to lots of 5* hotels in enlands at this hotel tops them all, even tho im onli 12 fantastic holiday for all the family and every one had a great time the staff are realy friendly espeshily the onces at the pool bar.

Our shower was also gross with mould all around it and throughout the holiday a large mould stain appeared on the ceiling of the shower, on closer inspection it appeared that all they did was paint over the stain before new guests as when i touched it there was wet paint on my fingers! I found the food very boring, although it seemed there was lots of choice it was very bland and unsatisfying! best meal was breakfast but we found ourselves eating out alot which we didnt expect to do seeing as we'd paid for all inclusive! i am a very fussy eater so pehaps it was me but i didnt like the food at all so sometimes went without an evening meal! on our last night the power went out again whilst i was in the shower which was very dangerous and my boyfriend had to shine his mobile fone on the floor to make sure i didnt slip! we waited in our room for about 10 minutes then decided to go to reception to see if they had any idea when the power would be back on, and at least there was light up there! i was getting ready to go out for the night with no hairdryer, straightners or even a mirror and as a 20 year old girl these things are very important!! we told by reception that it was a national problem and they had no idea when then power would be back on, we then walked out to the street to see the lights on in all the other hotels on the street! then the whole of the hotel including reception and the restaurants suffered a black-out for about 10-15 mins! you would think a hotel of this size would have a back-up generator or something! there were of course good points to the holiday- the towel animals left on the bed everyday managed to take my mind off the musty smell for about 2 minutes when we walked into the room! the big clan of racoons that came outside our room everyday to be fed, although beware if ur on the ground floor, they do come onto your balcony and try to get in your room!! we also went on the trip to coco-bongos which was amazing! also the staff at the hotel who obviously work very hard and are lovely! im not trying to blame anything on them they obviously do the best they can! i know it seems like an awful lot of moaning on my part but after putting out alot of money and lookin forward to this holiday we were extremely dissapointed with what we got, i understand it is still a developing country but this hotel is allegedly a 4* and supposed to be a Platinum- i just dont understand what qualities this hotel has to warrant such a rating", "Date": "October 25, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "England", "Title": "\u201cA bit of a let down\u201d", "Author": "jabbaEngland", "ReviewID": "UR10322549", "Content": "My wife and 2 teenage children stayed at the Tequila for 2 weeks in Aug.

Pools were clean although the pool bar was not, usually down to customers spliling drink into pool. Although there were no lager louts it would appear that you need to spend alot more money to get away from the England shirt and Chelsea short brigade. There is no poolside service and no drink seemed to be the same as the last. Although you may order a smirnoff vodka I got the dintinct immpression that the bottle was topped up with the local brand. The wine is also an aquired taste. The entertainment although they give it their best shot is pathetic. The food is first class with plenty of variety although the main buffet restaurant is a bit of crowded. The hotel could do with another 2 waiter served restaurants as I got tired of getting my own. There is a sports bar which stays open late along with a over18 disco. However be warned the sporst bar was full of young teenagers being served alcohol and being sick. The disco was the same often with parents happily attempting to get their kids into the disco arguing with security staff if they had been refused entry.

We too experienced the power cuts as menitoned in the review below. However what the people below did not say is that, not once did it effect the restaurants. The backup power they had at the hotel was excellent, meaning that if you are in reception or the restaurants you would not even know a powercut had taken place and the walkways were lit up also back to the room. The food was the same excellent standard as when the power was on. The reviewer below obviously doesn't realise that Mexico is not a developed country - has the reviewer never been to Greece or Turkey when there is a power cut. Try and fry your bacon over there when that happens! Also you are in a tropical climate, do you expect the whole place to be insect free? My wife got bitten to death too, if you can't stand this go to Cornwall next time! The food was great, staff were friendly, beach was unbelievable. Sports bar was great for English Premier league live games as they showed them all (more games than you would get on Sky!) You get a free mini bar in your room which is restocked every day. We asked for Pepsi Light instead of Pepsi when they came around to restock it. Give them a couple of dollars tip and consider it done for the rest of your holiday (tip - leave an empty bottle of Pepsi Light in your fridge to remind them this is what you want). The trips were excellent. Definitely recommend Tulum/Xel Ha all day trip. It can get a bit hot in Tulum but it's worth it for the scenery and anyway you cool off at XelHa in the afternoon. Didn't care much for the specialist restaurants in the hotel - you tended to not get much on your plate, but the buffet restaurant more than makes up for this. (You can never have too much choice!)

The coach transfer took an hour to get to our hotel and was very hot due to weather there but the airconditionin did its best to cool everyone down!! ARRIVAL Once we got to the hotel we were greeted by friendly members of staff that gave us a cool refreshing tropical drink plus keys etc and let us get on our way to our rooms, the staff brang our bags up to us about 10 minutes or so later. one thing is they dont tell you where bouts your rooms are so you spend a while walking round the resort trying to find your rooms, but we dint mind that much as it gave us a chance to have a nose around at the pool and that. HOTEL The lobby is very well presented with lots of fans and nice open areas with a water fountain in the middle, the staff at reception are very helpful and dont seem to get irritated with questions bein asked of them.I requested an iron and ironin board which was then brought up to my room after a couple of hours.they also have sheets that are updated which have the weather for the week on which is helpful to plan things even though the weather is very unpredictable! The gardens were beautiful with lots of animals, lizards and ants!! even though the ants werent beautiful just extremely annoyin!! (take lots of insect repellent and the trees provided a much needed shade when walkin around resort on hot days!! ROOM The room is extrememly spacious and clean! more than enough drawers and space in the wardrobe for everythin! a decent sized safety deposit box! very cool and refreshing with the air con and fan!The balconies are spacious with a clothes rack which is helpful. the dressing area included a big side where the sink is so there is plenty of room for all the things i had, the shower fits two people and worked fine, there is also two big double beds side by side that are on the hard side but didnt make sleeping a problem. The free minibar and alcohol dispensers were a bonus these were topped up every other day! The maid was very good and we had clean towels everyday and they left us cute towel animals! :-) There was no damp smell when we were there like some people had mentioned either. The only problem we had was that the first couple of days we were there, there was no electricity and that became annoyin when trying to get ready in monrnings and evenings! but the problem was sorted and they compensated us for it too. POOL The pool was lovely and refreshing in hot weather! The swim up pool bar was a godsend, the drinks were lovely and the bartenders were always happy and pleased to help you! There was a few bugs and leaves in the pool on some days but that cant be helped when its surrounded by trees, the cleaners did their best.Also the floor of the pool was a bit torn which was quite dangerous but wasnmt a massive problem but would have been nice for them to fix it. There were plenty of lloungers , even though the early birds stole all the good undercover loungers by 7.30am, the best loungers are the ones under a wooden umbrella as you are shaded from the sun in some places and if it happens to rain you are protected from it too! THE BEACH Across the road from the hotel is a shaded walkway which is just for pedestrians and the beach shuttle that comes by every 5 mins or so, between 7am -1pm and 3pm -7pm which takes you straight to the beach! But the walk down there isnt that long and is quite refreshing. Once you get to the end of the walkaway you are greeted by a beautiful view - white sands and bright blue seas! The sand was lovely and soft with plenty of loungers spread right across, there is a bit of a drop into the water from the sand but not too bad. The sea was very warm by mid-afternoon too which was a nice surprise! there is a beach cafe on the beach so you can have free drinks and food all day so you dont have to think of leaving to return for lunch or take much with you! There were some pretty fish in the sea too very close to shore which were nice to see especially when you have your snorkel equiptment on which is also free. ENTERTAINMENT LOVED IT!! thats all i can say!! we loved it!! they worked very hard for the performances they put on especially the crazy show which was very funny!! the entertainment staff were a highlight to our holiday! they would be a reason for us to return! The michael jackson show was good too and moulin rouge!! Theres lots of day time activites too so if you get bored lazin in the sun there is always bingo, rifle shootin, aerobics, dancin and more. They always enjoyed what they did and made us very happy!! FOOD The brakfast and tea buffet meal in the Jalisco restuarant connected to the lobby doesnt need reservations, and has a wide selction of breakfast and main meals, for example, pancakes, frenchtoast and english breakfasts. potatoes, chips, pizza, fish and meats and much more for tea. it was ok but alot of people liked it so each to thier own. we went to the mexican restuarant on the second day there and we didnt like it at all but again people there looked like they enjoyed it, thier fajitas are nothin like ours! despeite the food bein not 100% great for us we still loved it! EXCURSIONS we went to XCARET for the day but it rained allll day so wasnt tht gd! under ground rivers were amazin!! a must do!! but apart from that it wasnt that great, probabaly due to weather! WEATHER It rained the first few days we were so that was really disappointin as we were only there for a week! but the last few were boilin couldnt ask for better weather!! they supply umbrellas too so that was good!!even tho it rained it was still humid and warm. SHOPPING 5th avenue was filled with plenty of shops and the beach was nice. but the people were to us annoyin! you go past and they are already sat across from thier shop waitin for you then makin sure you go in thier to have a look then dont let you leave til you buy somethin as they come up with excuses of why you have to buy it and tryin to get round our excuses of why we cant e.g money etc.a few mins down the road from the hotel is a shoppin centre called the plazacar it has lots of souvenier shops and you can book your trips cheaper there too. good to grab some food etc without travellin to 5th avenue which only costs $5 in taxi anyways so not alot. a 250ml bottle of tequila (decorated by hat and scarf) was only $5.50 so it was really good for souveniers. The only bad points for us was the power shortage , the weather(which wasnt the hotels problem) and that the food wasnt great for us!!

Even Hurricane Dean couldn't stop us [we flew out the day after he passed through]. The flight was long but we were well looked after on board and the wave of heat that greets you at Cancun Int Airport made it all worthwhile. Passed through immigration, collected luggage and boarded coach without a hitch. Journey to the resort was made entertaining by the Mexican staff on board. Although two coach fulls arrived at the Riu we were all in our rooms within 15 minutes of arrival. The rooms are kept incredibly clean by the housekeeping staff and towels were changed as often as we required them to be. The fridge is also topped up each day but as we didn't use the mini bar can't comment on the other drinks available. The Jalisco restaurant always had an excellent selection of food and the service you receive cannot be faulted. We were lead to our table each time and offered beverages straight away. The Lupita at lunchtime also had a great selection and we found the birds fun to watch as they craftily pinched food as often as they could. The view from our table across the pool area was just beautiful. Anyone who has previously commented on the distance of the hotel to the beach must just be a touch lazy as it's really a lovely walk along the covered walkway and the buggy will stop for you enroute to offer you a lift anyway. The driver always says hello each time he passes, as do all the staff who are so friendly despite working long hours in the heat. The beach is glorious and we spent most of our time there or at the pool during the day. Although it can sometimes be busy at either location we never once went without a sun lounger and more often than not had a place in the shade as we were both sunburnt daily. Although the beach has suffered erosion in places just a 10 minute walk takes you to a much wider more deserted stretch. Would recommend the parasailing - great fun and the views are incredible. What really made our holiday however were the efforts of the entertainment staff who all work unbelievably hard the entire day. They work all day in and around the pool area as well as rehearsing for shows, then appear in costume for the photograph sessions in the foyer. They then lay on brilliant entertainment all evening which judging by the smiles and laughter they create is enjoyed by all. THANK YOU SO MUCH to them all.

The rooms themselves are find a bit basic and not 4/5 star as you would expect in uk. Shower needs redoing and we suffered a very bad ant problem in the bathroom. I mentioned it to the cleaner and he did try to kill them however they were spreading like wildfire. The major problem we had with the room was everything was damp from the bedding and after a few days all of our clothes were damp. My boyfriend started with breathing problems which I think was due to the damp. Cleaners and waiting staff work so hard they can not do enough for you. I found out how much they got paid and honestly I was horrifid. The meals in the hotel are fine lots of choice infact sometimes too much choice. Weather was hot it did rain for the odd hour the start of the week by the end of the second week it rained a lot of the time. We did lots of trips the dolphins, speed boats were well worth it. We booked to do the night out which included three bars and coco bongos. I would not recommend this trip unless you want to drink lots of cheap nasty drinks, watch the reps getting drunk and then trying to get the male clients on stage to strip off. Coco Bongos was good however they sit u on a step in the way of everyone and you have to leave after an hour. On the coach on the way back loads of people were being sick into plastic bags! Lovely. We had a huge problem with the power while we were there it kept going off which ment no lights, no aircon and no fan. This could range from 30 mins to 12 hours. It was dangerous when it went off all night you could not even get to the loo. The room was really hot unable to sleep. The rep was rubbish all he did was give us a complaint form.

The rooms are airy and clean with shower, toilet wash basin also wardrobe space with a safe and a fridge full of drinks which include water, coke, orange ect and of course the local beer corona very nice! Not forgetting the optics which you can use and have as much of the spirits as you like, cant be bad eh? Maids clean your rooms daily and change the beds and they do it properly not just a flick over here and there- to tip them is nice they honestly deserve it. The restaurant boasts space, cleanliness, great service and a variety of good food,the food is displayed so that you can help yourself to all on offer and the restaurant staff provide serving tongs ect to pick up the food so as not to use your fingers but....what i found so annoying, filthy and down right rude was that some guests insisted on using there hands to pick up food and put it in there mouths whilst standing there serving themselves! i am sure thats why i was unfortunate in contracting Viral Gastroenteritis during my stay. Not, i must stress the hotels fault they do provide serving implements. Entertainment is good and we enjoyed the Michael Jackson show very much excellent, very profesional. All in all top Quality hotel with hard working and very freindly staff.

The welcome was a bit hectic as 3 coach loads of people were arriving basically at the same time. The staff still managed to organise everyone, give out a complementray drink and get us to our rooms in about 5 minutes. We were given a ground floor room and wanted one on the first floor, staff were more than happy to accomodate our request and we had another room 15 minutes later. The rooms are fairly basic for 4*, but large and very clean. We had no problems with bad smells, broken / damaged ameneties or bad beds (we slept through every night) in either of the rooms we visited. Fridges are refilled on a daily basis ( i requested more beer and less fizzy drinks, no problem) and maintainence staff are very efficient. We smased a glass bottle and accidentally damaged the bug screen on the balcony, both problems were sorted within the day(seperate occasions). The variety of food available for breakfast, lunch and dinner was excellent. We stayed for 2 weeks and could easily have tried something new each day. The only downside was the food at the ala carte mexican restaurant which we did not enjoy. We didn't have much to do with the entertainment because it's not really our thing, although the mayan show on the last night we were there was incredible and authentic looking. Hats off to the team for that one. It's a nice relaxing walk down to the beach and theres plenty of space. The beach directly infront of the walkway was eroded when we were there but that couldn't have been less of a problem. The beach is long and there is next to no erosion further down. You can swap your towel for a fresh one although Im not sure how many times you can do it in the same day. One thing to note is you cannot get a towel from the other Riu hotels so make sure you pick one up before you head out. In conclusion, the Tequila offers something for all tastes and gets the things everyone requires from a hotel right; Exellent service and staff, good food and drink, nice surroundings and clean and comfy rooms.

Thomson platinum cruise - swimming with the dolphins snorkelling around the sharks and swimming with the sting rays, this was worth the money!!!!! The fat cat - this was good think it would be better if you were with a group of people. Jungle tour - drive your own speed boat then snorkelling this was brilliant to!

We were a bit apprehensive as we stayed here in May and loved it and were unsure if it would live up to the first visit. We needn't have worried we had a ball.

I don't understand why people are complaining about the rooms, ok I wouldn't have the furniture or colour scheme in my house but they are clean and comfortable and surely if you are on holiday you have better things to do than sit in your room!! We did have 3 lizards in our room but we just directed them back out. There were also a lot of ants in our room and despite keeping the mosquito screen closed constantly I was eaten alive one night. Think this was more to do with the time of year as this wasn't a problem in May. One thing to be cautious of is the Doctors Surgery. My bites became infected and I had to visit the doctor. It was absolutely disgusting. I work for the NHS and people complain our hospitals are dirty, they should visit the clinic at the Riu Yacatan!! My pal came in with me and she came out with 8 bites up one of her legs!!!! I would hate to have had an open wound that needed dressing!! The doctor can visit you in your hotel room for the same price as a trip to the surgery, I would definitely go for this option. Also make sure you are covered by your insurance. It cost $80 to see the doctor and then another $99 dollars for the medication approx \u00a3100 (nearly had to be rescitated when they told me the cost of the meds!!).

Their towels are in a horrible shape, and they need to change them. Our shower was plugged most of the trip and fixed after 4 telephone calls to the front desk. Restaurants - they are not 5*. I was at the Bahia Principe last year and the food doesn't even compare. The food was very boaring and tasteless. Our best meal was McDonalds in Playa del Carmen. Entertainment - it was OK. My husband really liked the Michael Jackson show. Service - very slow. Beach - excellent. The beach was better than the Bahia Principe. The only complain I have is that you can only get 1 tower a day and they make a big deal if you want to change your towel to a dry one. Also, the towels are very old, thin and stayed. Overall, the Riu Tequila is not a 5* hotel. I would give them 3*. The Bahia Principe Coba is a 4.5* and it was much, much better.

The service in the hotel was amazing and the staff were very helpful. When we first arrived the hotel lobby is lovely and staff were there waiting with our keys and a welcome drink. We were shown to our room and our cases were delivered within 15 minutes. The room was a little bit dated but we had a great balcony, 2 double beds, loads of space for clothes etc, tv, phone, safe, dressing area, mini bar (free), shower and seperate toilet. It was always cleaned and we never had any visitors (bugs, lizards etc). The food was amazing, a great choice all the time. We sometimes even went over to the Yucatan for lunch as we fancied a change of scenary. We went to the Mexican Restaurant one night and the Steak Restaurant twice. These were both great to. You just book outside the main restaurant in the morning for these. They are both Free aswell. Drinks wise, Corona is the main beer and its served everywhere. They have the widest selection of spirits and great cocktails. We did not like the wine at all!!! But there is so much to choose from that it makes no difference. The resort is great and pool area is fantastic. We thought the Tequilla was the best hotel out of the three (yucatan & playacar) as the pool was a bit quieter, with loads of sunbeds and the general resort areas were more natural. The beach is only a 5/10 minute walk down a covered/shaded walkway or you can get on the little buggy outside main reception. We prefered the walk!

The Tequila is by far the \u2018BEST\u2019 for all round service, surroundings and quality of food. Although the Tequila does not possess a beachfront location, compared with the other 2 hotels, the Tequila possesses a unique and individual charm. The beach is less than 10 minutes walk from the hotel lobby via a dedicated \u2018flat\u2019 pathway between the Palace and Yucatan hotels. Alternatively you can take the 7-seater shuttle buggy, which runs between 0730-1300 and 1500-1800, and takes less than 5 minutes round trip. Just be aware of queue jumpers (namely from non English speaking Continental countries). The beaches along this coastline are still recovering from Hurricane Wilmur (2 years ago) and more recently Hurricane Dean. The beach is still lovely, soft sands overlooking azure seas, but the beach is narrow, uneven and not gently sloping into the water (as it was 4 years ago). The best spot is under the palm trees at the Playacar hotel. We did have waited service on the beach for drinks, which was an unexpected bonus. The Tequila grounds are immaculate, well manicured and maintained, the accommodation blocks are unobtrusive, 2 floors unlike the Yucatan, and the layout revolves around the hotel pools and pool restaurant. This hotel is more intimate than the other 2, even though it is larger. It is not as noisy, and possesses a more classy atmosphere and ambience. The staff are friendlier and appear more efficient. Our visit coincided with Hurricane Dean. The Hotel team were well prepared, organized and ensured that all the guests were safe, well informed, and had sufficient provisions to ride out the storm. The hurricane was over by 0730, breakfast resumed in the main restaurant at 0800, and the hotel was back to normal service by the afternoon, unlike the other 2. As well as the service, the food at the Tequila is by far superior in terms of quality, variety and presentation. Enjoy the Sunday morning champagne breakfast. Sorry to say but ate at both the Yucatan and Playacar and was bitterly disappointed with both their lunch and dinner options. The pool at the Tequila, is separated by the pool bar/ restaurant (which also doubles up as the a la carte steak house restaurant in the evening). The pool with the swim up pool bar was busier. The other pool was dedicated to pool side activities, which include water polo, basketball and aerobics. However, was relatively quiet otherwise. The pool temperature was perfect, and regularly cleaned. Sun-loungers could be found around the pool at any time of day, although people did tend to reserve the popular spots early from 0730, when the pool towels became available. The pool experience at the Playacar and Yucatan was in contrast busier, noisier and not as intimate. The rooms at all 3 hotels were of a similar standard. Although I would recommend a first floor room at the Tequila, as the room appears larger due to the higher ceilings. Our room was clean and comfortable, but appeared a little tired. But how long do you spend in your room on holiday? The mini bar is excellent, restocked every couple of days. Although it can be restocked upon request (@ reception) and takes approx. 5-10 minutes to action. Room 808 overlooked the pool, 1-2 minutes walk from main lobby, restaurant and theatre. The entertainment during the day was fun and well organized by the Animation Team. A good way to work off those extra calories!! In the evening, the entertainment was \u2018hit and miss\u2019, as some shows were good such as Michael Jackson, and the live Mexican Band. Overall the shows were disappointing at the Tequila (as with the other hotels), however you are able to watch the entertainment in any of the resorts, which increases your options, and gives you greater choice. We did, and it was nice to experience different surroundings. The Tequila does have a Sports Bar, adjacent to the Theatre, with internet, pool, air hockey and table football, plus the many TV screens. There is a small charge for use of games as with any arcade. Change could be obtained over the bar. There is a small shopping complex in Playacar, a 5 minute walk from the hotel, very good for souvenirs particularly Mexican pottery and artifacts. There is a Kiosk where you can book trips to Xel-Ha, Chichen Itza, Tulum etc, cheaper than Thomson and other Tour Operators. $76 as opposed to $99 each for a fully inclusive trip to Xel-Ha. Also, there are several Kiosks selling lovely shell and beaded jewellery, approx. $8-10 per necklace. Remember you can barter. Shopping in Playa del Carmen ($5 taxi ride each way), revolves around 5th Avenue. Being British, did not like the imposing nature of the shop keepers. They would sit outside trying to persuade you to enter their shop. Once inside, the door would close, making you feel somewhat uncomfortable and intimidated. Just be aware, as it could spoil an otherwise very nice atmosphere, very pretty lights, and music. It is best to go in the evening, at dusk, to take full advantage of the lights and atmosphere. Summary... If you are after excellent food, intimate surroundings, immaculately maintained hotel, very friendly and helpful staff, value for money, then choose the Tequila. It was our second visit to Mexico, first visit to Tequila and definitely not our last. NB. Don\u2019t stay at Viva Maya, stayed there 4 years ago when it was lovely.

Rooms- Clean and has everything you need, beds are slightly hard but nothing that will keep you awake at night. The musty smell- WHAT musty smell our room didn't smell at all and the air con seemed fine sometimes was a little bit cool so we had to turn it off. Mini bar was always stocked. One thing that wasn't very nice was some days our towels didn't smell very nice-probably because they have so many to wash etc. Beds were ok probably not the most comfortable but we didn\u2019t have any problems with them at all. The maid went in about lunch time but we didn\u2019t have a problem as we never went back to room until late afternoon. 1 thing me being a girl I like to straighten my hair but I couldn\u2019t as my straightners didn\u2019t work at night, they worked in the morning and really late at night to start with I thought it was a major problem but got used to tying my hair up and it kept me much cooler as well. Grounds- Were fantastic, loads of wildlife and was also well maintained. Our room was right near the jungley bit so we got to see all the raccoon\u2019s everyday and they would get really close to you. Pool- The pools were really nice, big enough for everyone and they were at the right temperature. The sun beds in the pool were also a great idea. We used to get up and reserve sun beds because everyone else did this way we knew what we had somewhere to sit. The people that didn\u2019t do this found it hard and people a few times came and sat under our umbrella, literally at your feet which isn\u2019t fair. Food- Was amazing I never expected it to be as good as it was, there was something for everyone, the BBQ nights were great and happened twice a week. We also went to the steak house- didn\u2019t think it was fantastic but was a change, we could never get a reservation for the Mexican so we decided to eat out in PDC in a Mexican. Entertainment- The staff work so hard, there\u2019s always something to do, entertainment was also good, we watched it most nights, towards the end of our holiday we found it getting busy and sometimes found it hard to get a seat. But all in all the entertainment was funny and was something to do in the evenings, we went to PDC a few times too which was nice and a change, looked around the shops and had a few drinks, its very modern. Trips- We went on two trips- Catamaran and Xcaret. The sea was very rough when we went out on the catamaran and I spent most of my day with the rest of the girls up the back being sick but the crew were great and they kept checking of your ok, they also kept the men busy. There was drinks and food on board which you help yourself to. You also get to go snorkelling and on a speed boat, I would of really enjoyed my day if I wasn\u2019t so ill. Xcaret- Great day out we got a taxi there and paid to get in there to. Loads of things to do and a great day out. Recommend it to all. Nice places to sun bath, swim with dolphins etc. Had a brilliant holiday best one yet and would defiantly recommend to all, I still wish I was there.

We flew via USAir and arrived to perfect weather. As soon as you enter the resort, the entire staff is just so friendly. I had requested a room not on the main walkway and they granted it. We were in the 700 block....close enough to everything, but quiet enough.......afterall..we were on our Honeymoon! :) The room was big enough. It definately needs some upgrading though. Yes there is a \"tropical\" smell to it...but you are on the Carribean Sea, this will happen. We brought a tree air freshener figuring this would be the case and our room was fresh smelling from that. They restocked our beer everyday, upon request. There are 2 different people that clean the room and stock the bar...we tipped them each $2 a day. The food.....It was certainly plentiful! The breakfast and lunch buffet's had a very good assortment on it, yes it was virtually the same everyday, but with such an assortment I know we did not get sick of it for the 6 days we were there. Dinner.....we only reserved for the Steakhouse 1 night. I think it was hit or miss. I certainly was not expecting Morton's, but my husband and I ordered the exact same thing (Ribeye) where mine was a very nice cut of meat and done exactly as I wanted, his was not. It was a very good meal though and great to order off a menu. At the buffet the rest of the time for dinner, they had a different theme every night and we agreed on the favorite being the BBQ night. It was excellent! The beach.....the cart runs every 5-10 mins if you do not feel like walking, but it is a very nice walk under a beautiful covered walkway. Once we got to the beach for the first time, I was just in awe of how gorgeous the water was! So crystal clear! I grew up in NY and am not used to that! LOL We had no problems finding chairs there no matter what time of day it was. The pool.......the chairs there are definately harder to come by. People typically reserve their chairs early in the morning with their towels. We did see one argument break out because some people moved a families towels. I don't know how management can get around that issue, but it seems to be one that goes on alot, from what I gathered. We only spent one full day at the pool, but really enjoyed it...me in the sun and my hubby in the shade (someone didn't put on a high enough SPF sunscreeen the 1st day). The pool bar is definately alot of fun! We were there just about everyday after excursions or the beach. The staff......the are such friendly people. I can't say enough about them. Hard working for sure. I understand that it is all inclusive, but tip them if they are doing a good job. From what I understand, they make so little. $1 or $2 dollars a day for us is less than what we spend on a Cafe Mocha. The other guests......it is a VERY high Euro occupancy. We met some wonderful wonderful people there. Everyone was into just hanging out and enjoying themselves...that is what vacation is all about! One afternoon we ventured to the pool bar at the Yucatan and after 1/2 hour said forget it, lets go back across. The people were definately not as friendly there. I guess you could say the pool bar at the Tequila was our watering hole. We typically met up with the same groups in the afternoon and chatted away about our different cultures, governments, our kids, etc. OH and that brings up another point......if you do not like kids, you will not like this resort. It was packed with families while we were there. Yes we were on our Honeymoon, but this is our second time around and we have kids, so we enjoyed it very much. In fact, I am already plotting and planning to take a trip there next year with the entire family. Excursions....We did a 1/2 day trip to Tulum using Tulum Express(Through Apple...the only good thing they did). Our guide was Jorge and he was just fantastic! I think, considering how hot it was the day we went 1/2 day was perfect. We also did Parasailing at the beach with Scuba Caribe. FANTASTIC!!! I am afraid of heights, but did it. How often do I get to do that in the Pittsburgh, PA Area!?!?! LOVED IT.....very worth the money.($110 for two). Playa Del Carmen.....LOVED IT! We had such a great time walking around there. We actually went into town twice. Both times we took a cab ($5). My advice on the shopping there is to walk around and get a feel for the prices of things. I had gone over to the Playacar Plaza to look at jewelry and other items before we went into town, so I had a good feel for how much I would pay for something. If you are not getting the price you want for something(in my case a bracelet) walk out. 9 times out of 10 they will give you the price you want....if not, you are going to find the exact same thing elsewhere if not very similar. Honestly my only complaint (and apparently alot of other peoples that we saw while we were there) about the trip is all about Apple Vacations and I have already voiced that opinion to them on the phone and via email. I will post that problem in the Playa Del Carmen Forums.", "Date": "August 11, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Las Vegas, Nevada", "Title": "\u201cNice, but Won't go back\u201d", "Author": "maryhochda", "ReviewID": "UR8375453", "Content": "We stayed at the RIU Tequila for three nights, July 30-August 2. This was our third trip to Playa Del Carmen. First stay at Iberostar Tucan (much nicer in our opinion) and second stay at the Luna Blue (nice for the price). This was a last minute trip and the Tequila was chosen because of the great reviews. The grounds overall were beautiful, but it's Playa! The things that I did like were the breakfast buffet and dinner buffet. They rivaled the Iberostar for sure. I think the dinner buffet at the RIU was actually better. We didn't try the al a cartes so can't comment there. The front desk personel were all very nice, quick and efficient. The Yucatan beach was nice and had plenty of loungers for us to use, and the walkway to the beach was very shaded and pretty. Now the reasons I won't go back; the pool area was pretty, but the pool itself was kind of gross. The water was cloudy and there was a lot of debris and slime in it. As usual with most of the all-inclusives the loungers were all reserved by morning. We have a trip booked in Oct. for the Yucatan and the saving of loungers was even worse there! The atmosphere is quite subdued, no music really going on at the pool or beach, plus no umbrellas or palapas on the beach. The swim up bar and the lobby bar both smelled horrible if you were sitting right up to the counter. It smelled sour, like the alcohol isn't being wiped up well enough. The drinks were not the best either. The mixes tasted strange and either too fake fruity sweet or really watery. The nightclub was way too smokey and really not that great. Drinks at the Iberostar were way better and so was the beach and nightclub. The 24 hour snacks are in a fridge and you have to heat them, really gross. The lunch buffet left a lot to be desired. The same everyday, and the hotdogs were always close to cold on the inside! The rooms are in dire need of renovation. The bedding had threads hanging out all over, the towels were no better and smelled slighty moldy. The air doesn't work well, but the ceiling fan on high really helped that out. There were hundreds of those tiny ants everywhere! We experienced those at the Iberostar too but not to the extent we did at the Tequila. They started in the bathroom and by the end of our stay they were all the way along the wall and all over our bed covers! The first night we had two huge cockroaches run across our floor too. The front desk sent someone out to spray and we didn't see any more after that. I understand it's the jungle, but seeing huge roaches in your room just leave a bad taste in your mouth. We're NOT picky or snotty, but I'm truly surprised that this hotel gets such high remarks. I won't be going back as there are too many other nice places in Playa for the same price or less, and we got a great deal! We're a little nervous about staying at the RIU Yucatan, but then we remind ourselves that it's still paradise!

We arrived at our hotel before noon and were shown right to our room. Most hotels, even when the room is ready, won't let you check in until the actually \"check in\" time. The rooms (although a little dated) were very clean. The beds are hard but we asked for a bed pad and it made it better. They also brought us a roll away bed for my daughter so that she wouldn't have to sleep with her brother and we weren't charged for the use to the bed. We never had to ask for extra towels-some resorts we've stayed at a great with towel the first few day then tend to forget to leave wash clothes or hand towels. The food is amazing and I'm a pretty picky eater (no red meat, no seafood) but I always found something good to eat. They have the best french fries I've ever tasted. We ate at the Steakhouse one night (my husband and sons choice). They really enjoyed the steak. My daughter and I had the mustard chicken and I have to say I was very surprised how good it was. The buffet had a sushi night with a great veggie sushi-i couldn't get enough of it. The drinks are pretty good too. (I think I tried the entire bar list.) GREAT mojitos!!!! Hint: Tip the bartender in the begining of your stay and the drinks will be even better. We used the pool at the Riu Yucatan-only because it was closer to the beach and my kids love the beach (had it been just my husband and I we would of stayed at our resort). I think the pool at the Tequila is nicer that the one we hung out at. I know that some people complained a bit about the walk to the beach from the Tequila but I didn't find it too bad. And after a long day in the sun the breeze through the walkway was usually quite nice. We did use the shuttle a few times and only had to wait a few mintues for it to pick us up. The good spots at the pool tend to be gone before 8 am but we were always able to find 2 chairs in the sun (for my husband and myself) and 2 chairs in the shade for the kids (in case they need a sun break). The shows at night were always entertaining. The \"Michael Jackson\" show that everyone raves about is really great. If you only see one show my suggstion is to see that one. I have to say that everyone at the hotel works soooooooo hard at keeping it clean and making sure your stay is pleasant. You are always greeted with a smile and a \"hola\" even after many of them have been working for long hours. We would without a doubt stay there again.

We had 6 others besides us in our group who stayed at the Yucatan (across the street - on the beach). Both have incredible pools. Yucatan has the winning edge though because you can see the ocean while lounging around. If your not a beach goer then the Tequila is perfect. The walk over to the beach was ok. They do have a little golf cart running back and forth from the beach to the Tequila lobby, but it fills up quickly and after a week the walk does become tiresome. Don't forget anything is all I'm sayin. The food at tequila was better than the yucatan! Breakfast was incredible. You name it they had it! Lunch was a little bit of the same thing everyday. Some grilled fish, chicken, pork it was ok. There was pizza and fries for kids. Salads, cold cuts and stuff. You can usually find something, you won't starve. Dinner service was always good too. Good ice cream in buffets. DO NOT MISS THE BARBEQUE NIGHT out on the patio of the buffet! YUM! Steakhouse at tequila was good too! Skip the japanese restaurant over at the yucatan. Trust Me!

The flight actually went surprisingly quickly considering the length of it and having my almost 2 year old sitting on our laps (although she thoroughly enjoyed gallavanting up and down the aisles). When you get off the plane the first thing that hits you is the heat and the humidity, but you'll quickly get used to it. The coach trip to the hotel was about an hour or so, which was probably the worst part, because you just want to get there! We got there and were greeted by the doting staff and a non alcohoilc tequila sunrise(?). We then walked to our rooms, the complex is very big and at first it takes you a while to get your bearings, but the signs are plentiful and self-explanatory. We got to our room which was a bit dated, but I wasn't surprised as I had read the reviews which mentioned this detail. The beds are plenty big enough but perhaps a bit hard. The optics full of alcohol were in their cabinet along with plenty of non-alcoholic beverages / water in the fridge. Cut a long story short......This holiday was wonderful and I have to point out that the entertainment staff are the best, laying on different shows every night (apart from one Karaoke night per fortnight) The childrens entertainer was fantastic, totally brilliant kept the little ones entertained no end. He would also teach them several routines which would be shown at 8.30 at the Mini Disco at the main stage. The pool was lovely.....plenty of sunbeds......the food is wonderful, the main restuarant is buffet style, however there are some meals that the chefs will cook whilst you are there. There is plenty of choice..... you could really have something different everyday. The Steak House was fantastic, and although the Mexican restaurant was nice too, it is by the beach at the other hotel and I got bitten to bits by the local mosquitos. Ensure you take plenty of mossie spray/cream/plugins etc and buy some of the local anti-mossie spray ('Off') as well. There is a local Walmart a short taxi ride ($5 / 50pesos), or long stroll from the hotel. This sells just about everything, i.e. Asda / Tescos, so don't worry if you forget to take something!

We had a great time but the hotel, the beach and the resort in general was very busy with lots of English people, some Americans and Canadians. The hotel was really nice and set out well. The rooms were in blocks of two storey buildings with about 8 rooms to each floor which were scattered throughout the grounds of the hotel with lovely gardens all around. Always very quiet, we were never disturbed by noise apart from the wildlife. There were lots of iguanas in the grounds, totally harmless and racoons which travelled around at night in groups with their babies checking out the bins and also these things that resembled large guinea pigs (that's the only way I can describe them) Other reviews I read said there were monkeys but we never saw any. The rooms were clean but I would say slightly dated in the colour scheme but the maid did a great job cleaning and even picked my childrens' clothes up off the floor and left them in a neat and tidy pile every day! places to eat, the main restaurant, Jalisco, by the hotel lobby which you did not need to make reservations for and which had the greatest choice, the Steak House which was set in the middle of the pool, which was called the Lupita in the daytime and the Mexican Beach Restaurant. The Steak House and the Mexican which was by the beach you had to book in the main restaurant each morning for that night - it got booked up very quickly by about 8.30am. My main moan was the sunloungers by the pool which were covered in towels by 8am every morning and which sometimes weren't occupied until the afternoon. There was a policy in the hotel that you weren't allowed to do this but no-one took any notice because no-one enforced it! The beach was across the road from the hotel. There was a free golf cart taking people backwards and forwards all day if you didn't fancy the walk which in that heat (34 degrees) you sometimes didn't have the energy but it was only about 7 - 10 mins down a covered walkway to get there. The beach itself was a slight disappointment as a lot of the sand had been washed away during the hurricane about 3 years ago so it made the beach narrow therefore not much room which is probably why it looked so busy. Each hotel has its own sunloungers on the beach but the Rui Tequila and Rui Yucatan (sister hotel) had loungers but no parasols so therefore no shade and you weren't allowed to use the beds or parasols of the other hotels. Further up the beach to the left there were large sandbags on the beach which were a bit unsightly but to the right the further you went the quieter it got but obviously no loungers but if you wanted peace and quiet it was better. The sea was beautiful and so blue and warm and the sand soft and white, but the snorkelling off the beach was none existant. There was lots of watersports, free catamarans, kayaks, bodyboards. Jets skis were $55 and there was also paragliding. The swimming area was a little limited because of the boats and jet skis coming in and out. About two mins walk from the hotel, turn left out of the entrance, was a small shopping precinct selling gifts etc. but also a bank, chemist, small food store you can also book some excursions there. We found when we had our welcome meeting in the hotel they were very quick to get you to book any excursions you wanted to do there and then but in actual fact they were quite a bit more expensive than the precinct or Playa del Carmen. For example a Thompson trip, through the hotel, to swim with whale sharks was $230 per person, in town or even at the Scuba Caribe hut inside the hotel the price was only $170 per person and they still pick you up and drop you off. We did four excursions for four people and it cost us $1500 which we thought was quite dear but you can't go all that way and not do any but we didn't realise it was cheaper in town. Playa del Carmen is 5 mins taxi drive away and costs $5. Ask for 5th Avenue which is where all the shops are, bars and restaurants. It is a nice street which takes quite a while to talk along but we found the precinct by the hotel cheaper for gifts to take home (don't forget to barter) We had a great holiday but we're not sure we would go back as it was very busy but maybe that was just the time of year.", "Date": "July 25, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta", "Title": "\u201cLoved it!!

The hotel, from the very beginning, lived up to the reviews and was immaculate in all areas. STAFF: They just could not do enough for you and were constantly busy, from the chambermaids to the poters and restaurant staff. Really polite and very very friendly. ACCOMODATION: Basic rooms but, again, very very clean and well presented and equipped with all that we needed. The mini-bar and 4 optic cabinet were stocked regularly and if we ever ran out, they'd send more 'provisions' at any time of the day or night. POOL: The pool at the hotel is fantastic, and had plenty of loungers around it and many shaded areas. There was, however the age-old annoying habit of 'Towels on loungers' from as early as 7.30 in the morning. There were signs informing the guests that they would be removed, but they weren't. We removed them ourselves....!!! Then totally denied any knowledge. The swim-up bar was wonderfully staffed and stocked with everything the main bars had. BEACH: The Tequila is approx. 500 yards from the beach, thru the walkway of the Yucatan hotel opposite. The beach was very clean and had incredible soft white sands although it is quite narrow and close to the ocean in points. There were also plenty of loungers and plenty of opportunity for shade under the palm trees if you were getting too toasted. LOCATION: The hotel is a 5 minute ($5) journey from Playa Del Carmen where the night life was very relaxed and friendly. Plenty of choice of food from McD's for the unadventurous to Tapas and traditional Mexican Grills for the seasoned stomach. Particularly good restaurants were: Limones (5th Avenue) and Ajua (just off 5th Avenue and recommended by hotel bell boy) FOOD AND DRINK: An incredible choice for all meals. If oyu couldn't find something you liked, you were walking about with your eyes shut. Great service in the restaurant too for all the drinks. Steak meal in the pool restaurant was nice but nothing wonderful, although it was a break from self service. The 'Mexican' restaurant in the Yucatan was apparently not up to the same standard though. Fabulous range of drinks and a great bars in the complex. Lumumba is a brandy and choc milk drink...please try it. A pudding in a glass. EXCURSIONS: Xel-Ha (Aqua Park) - Really good fun and well worth the visit. Plenty to do for all the family. You will need 'Bio-degradable' sun cream for this but it's very expensive in the park. It's about 40 minutes from the hotel by coach. Fat-Cat Catamaran - Best money I've ever spent and really enjoyed the half day 1.30 - 6.30pm. (Afeternoons are apparently less crowded) Snacks and drinks(as much as you wanted were available from the start. A funny, friendly crew and very well organised from the start. Being pulled along on a drag-net at the back of the boat was hilarious, but tighten the waist cord on your shorts first....!!!!! Snorkelling over reefs, Sun bathing opportunities, swimming and a Speed boat journey at the end of the day....! Wonderful and great value for money.....! 'Romantic Meal - Solyman Beach' - This is only an opinion, but please do not waste your money on this tat. Absolutely shocking and ridiculously expensive ($99). As vomit-inducing as the smell from the toilets in the garage-type restaurant entrance. Pathetic 'Religious' ceremony and a stinking beach did not help either. The food could have been bought for less than \u00a36 and was so long in coming that I would have happily got up and walked out, if we hadn't been so far away from the hotel (over an hour....) The rep was told about this and said that she enjoyed it...enjoyed the commission more like...!!!! We only took the 3 above excursions but were also told the the F1 Yucatan Explorer was fantastic and the trip to Xcaret was worth the time and money. Cozumel is a small island reached from Playa Del Carmen, via a 45 minute ferry trip (\u00a310 return). This place is fabulous. Carlos 'n' Charlies, 5 mins walk from the ferry terminal was a riot....plastic yard glasses full of cocktails and lovely looking waitresses pouring tequila shots down your throat and shaking your head around.

(General Areas) Very Clean. Well kept Gardens and paths Rooms. Again very clean. Sheets changed twice a week. Towels changed daily if left on floor. Maid cleaned room by midday everyday we were there and left different towel animal.(This pleased my wife no end). Fridge kept stocked with beer soft drinks and water. Pool. Busy but still nice and quiet for the first week. Absolute nightmare the second. The hotel was invaded by large numbers of spanish single sex groups during the second week. The already busy pool area could not cope with the numbers trying to use it. The behaviour of these groups was not good. They camped themselves in large groups between people laying on sun loungers and the pool edge smoking shouting etc. Many people moved. The spanish had the loungers. Perfecto!! They then proceeded to smoke in the pool not using ash trays. The rest you can imagine!!!!!!!!! We moved to the beach for the rest of the second week. The Beach. Small crowded but lovely. Try taking a stroll. Turn right after accessing the beach through the Beach bar and walk past sandals (The last hotel). You can walk for miles with beautiful blue sea on one side and lush greenery on the other. Quiet peaceful Bliss!!!!!!!!!!! Entertainment. The entertainment staff are without doubt the hardest working group of people I have ever met. Most are at the very least Bi-Llingual and several are tri/Quad-Lingual. Their clearly enjoy what they do. Their evening shows are well presented,very well put together and entertaining. They also work during the day providing activties like water polo and salsa dancing etc. We cannot say enough good things about this team Restaurants. The food is very good. Most is buffet style. Ate at the steak house twice. Menu and set meal time a bit restrictive,meal was good though. My only gripe was that smoking was allowed in both restaurants and on the terrace at the main restaurant. This should be stopped. I do not believe that in 2007 it is sociably acceptable to allow smoking whilst people are eating. Excursions. We did two trips. Fatcats Catermeran. (Fantastic day out.) Sailing Fishing Snorkelling and a speed boat ride. Brilliantly entertaining crew We thought this trip was excellent value for money. Chitza-Nitza. (Intresting day out.) 3 Hour coach trip each way. Thomson guide (Duran) was very good. This trip involves a lot of walking over uneven ground in extreme temperatures. (It was 40 degrees plus with 90 plus humidity on the day we went). Shade is at a premium. My wife was close to passing out and sufferered prickly heat We would not recomend this trip for youngsters or the elderly. An umbrella or hat or preferabally both are a must. (They sell pretty spanish style sun umbrellas at the flea stores at the site entrance. These are ideal and make a nice keepsake) Thomson Reps. Paul and Hailey work very long hours and give excellent service. Overall this is a nice hotel with a good staff. The facilities are good but do struggle to cope when the hotel is full. The first week the mixture between family groups and couples/singles was just about right. The second week large numbers of single sex spanish groups upset the balance and the relaxing atmosphere was lost. Maybe the hotel is advertised differently in Spain, We think that despite the small hiccups we would go back.

our expectations were once again exceeded by far! there was not a part of our 14 night stay we didn't enjoy! the food is out of this world, the drinks, the entertainment were amazing. we have never seen seas so blue, the skies so blue and the sands so white!! the people were so friendly and always willing to help. we were made to feel special wherever we went. it was truly 5 star all the way. we were lucky to have been in mexico for independance day2! the mexicans truly know how to celebarate as a country and the entertainment ran all day long at the tequila! the staff just never tire of working hard to keep the whole resort immaculate! i am very fussy when it comes to hygiene but have to say i had no concerns at the riu requila. it was a really lovely amosphere, the gardens were a delight to walk through every day! the short walk to the beach was walking through an enclosed walkway shrouded with flowers and plant life from the begining to the end. the walkway brings you out onto views of the bluest sea and then the soft white sandy beaches! the excursions were out of this world!! check out chic in itza, it's now one of the new 7 wanders of the world!! this was a truly magical hoilday, an experience i would repeat in flash!! i will wait and see what riu has instore for me for my next hoilday, riu everytime!!!", "Date": "July 18, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4",

time and had no issues with the flight. arrived in cancun expecting to wait for hours getting thru immigration. what a surprise ,this took all of 10 minutes and were leaving the airport. problem area #1. vacation club workers in the airport posing as representatives from the various hotels and resorts. they stopped us telling us that they were w/applevacations(a big lie) they all seem to be pushing vacations clubs at the mayan palace.get this, the price for this vacation club is 129,000.00. that's right 129,000.00 after hearing the whole presentation the price will come down, but it is totally unaffordable. if you go, go to get the prize for going and then leave. we got three tickets to visit xcaret. we found our transportation and after 45 minutes arrived at the riu tequila. no baggage men arrived when we pulled up so we had to pull our luggage inside to the check in counter. we were greated w/drinks which was nice. check in went with out issue. we were given our keys and were directed to our room. our room was in the back near the road. had no problems with noise. the room was quite nice. good size. i found the curtain separating the bedroom form the bathroom no problem at all. in fact it created a separate changing area and bath area. we did encounter our #2 issue. the room was filled w/mosquitos. at least one hundred, swarming around. this however was resolved by a call to the desk. prompt service saved the day. they even left a can of bug spray for the remained of the stay. the pool was not a big as i would have liked but it was nice. there are two sides one for activities and one with the pool bar. the pool did get very crowded during the afternoon. this of course caused the water to by quite warm. best times for a swim were before 11 am. the pool bar stayed crowded also. people just sat and drank. still had no problem getting a drink. if you want quick service go inside. the bar there is usually empty. there is a problem getting a palapa during the day at the pool. you must be at the pool before 9 am or you'll want till after 3 for one. get up early by 7 am and just leave towels on the loungers of your choice. everyone did this. issue #3 no one followed the posted rules at the pool. balls were being thrown. i saw several people get beaned by a hard thrown ball. people were diving in the pool-not deep enough. most of the posted rules were not followed and there was noone to enforce them. the beach was not on the tequila property. you had to walk about 10 minutes to get to the beach or you could take a shuttle. the beach was shared by about 4 resorts,3 of which are riu resorts. the beach is quite big. but there is little shade. if you need shade get to the beach befor 7 am. again the beach was great. the various shades of blue from the water was breath taking. the water was wonderful. not too cold. just right do not stay too long our you will burn. we saw one lady carried from the beach-too much sun the buffet dining was awesome. breakfast was always good.any many choices dinner was the same. so many choices of food. we have been to alinclusive resorts for 10 years and this had to have the best food. look nightly for the fruit carving. great artistic touch the tequila had 2 speciality restaurants a steak house and a mexican restaurant. reservations had to be made daily in the morning when going for breakfast. never had a problem getting reservations. the steakhouse was the best. steaks cooked just right. the mexican one left much to be desired. all of the food was over cooked. overall a great resort. be prepared for many many europeans. there were very few americans here. be prepared for rudeness and very poor manners. the kids club was good but only from 10:30to12 and then 3:00 to 4:30 daily. good nightly shows traveled to xcaret for the day-park is from 9am to 9pm-very long day and very hot but the night show is a must see", "Date": "July 17, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service":

I booked with the Tequila because I wanted a beach holiday and got a good rate. Although the tequila does not have a beach their sister property the Yucatan across the street does. The walk is about 15-20 depending on where on the resort your room is. It is a pleasant walk and as other reviewers have mentioned the path is shaded. There is also a shuttle that goes between the 2 properties throughout the day. Check in went smoothly. My room is similar to those that others have described. It was painted a bright color. Tile floors. It included a mini bar refilled every 2 days and liquor dispensors on the wall. I was spoiled staying at the Aventura Spa Palace last year and this room was in my opinion not as nice however it was clean and suitable. Honestly I didn't spend too much time in the room. The grounds were lovely, well manicured and every staff member we passed by was extremely friendly. The service in the bar was always on point. I never waited long for a drink. Because I don't eat meat I was a bit concerned about finding enough vegetarian opptions but there was no need to worry. They had many options and for a resort the food was actually decent. I spent all of my time at the beach at the yucatan rather than the pool at the Tequila but it always looked like people were having a great time and the animacion team kept things going. As far as the beach goes I never had a problem getting a lounger. Yes, it was crowded but there were plenty of loungers. The beach was sandy and the water was amazing. It was a beautiful blue color. If you are interested in Scuba Diving Scuba Caribe has a location at the Yucatan. I did the discovery dive. It was my first time diving and honestly I was really scared to do it (not realizing how scared I would be when I signed up) The instructor James was extremely patient and helpful with me the entire time. I'm glad I did it and would recommend the discovery dive for someone wanting to get a taste of diving without being certified. I got 2 massages (at the Yucatan). One at the \"spa\" area by the beach. The therapist was great and while it was relaxing to hear the waves you could also hear kids screaming. The second massage was in the spa and it was much more peaceful. They have a jacuzzi and sauna for use before the massage. Once again the therapist was great. All in all it was a good vacation. I would recommend the Tequilia to anyone wanting a good holiday who doesn't need luxury but wants a nice place to stay.

We picked Riu because it was inexpensive, and expected the quality of the hotel would be reflected by the price, but thought we wouldn't be spending much time there anyways. We were wrong on both counts! The hotel is beautiful, the rooms spotless and very cute, and the service fantastic. We ended up taking a few days to just hang out at the hotel and enjoy the pool and beach across the street. One thing we had our reservations about before arriving was the fact that the hotel is not on the beach. However, we simply had to cross the street, walk down a short (and pretty) path, and we were there. The food at the restaurants was quite good, and the only complaint we had was that the steak wasn't very good. But the breakfast buffet more than made up for it. We'd both highly recommend eating at Yaxche on 5th Avenue if you're visiting this area. We were skeptical about eating food outside of the hotel, but decided to get adventerous and were so glad that we did. There's a beautiful garden patio in the back of Yaxche and the food was some of the best I've ever had. The setting is incredibly romantic, and it was definitely the highlight of our trip.

The other three are the Yucatan, the Playacar and the Palace. The two former hotels facilities are available to Tequila guests. However, guests can only visit the Palace. Despite all four being classed as five star, the Palace is obviously more upmarket. But don\u2019t let that dissuade you from a visit to the Tequila. The staff go out of their way to make your stay special. The Tequila tries hard to live up to its rating and succeeds in all but the overall standards of the dining: Not that there is anything wrong with the food, but having eaten in five star non-package hotels around the world, it would be difficult to cater to that quality at package prices. Having said that, the food was varied, well presented and of good quality. We ate also in the Yucatan a couple of times but preferred the ambience of the Tequila. We were slightly apprehensive about the fact that the Tequila is away from the beach, whereas the Yucatan and Playacar are on the beach, but there was no need to worry. There is a shaded walkway that can be quite pleasant, providing you don\u2019t walk during the highest temperatures. For those who don not need, or feel like, the exercise there is an open free minibus operating a roughly 10 to 15 minute service. The first thing that strikes you on arrival at the beach is that the colours presented in the travel magazines have not been fooled with (no filters, touching-up etc). The blues, turquoises and buff-white of the sand are unbelievable. The water is actually warm, so there is no shock getting into the sea. The animation team work hard during waking hours entertaining those who require it. I could never understand why anyone would want to play beach volleyball with the temperature in the high 30\u2019s and humidity around 90%, but each to his own!! The evening shows were well rehearsed an presented: Guests from both the Yucatan and Playacar would come over for the Tequila\u2019s entertainment. If you are adventurous, a taxi is around $2 (US) from the hotel to the centre of Playa del Carmen. Have a wander round; laugh-off the \u2018timeshare\u2019 hustlers. Down at the front you can get tickets for the ferry to Cozumel. It is quite an experience and worth visiting. During our second week, the hurricane threatened to strike the Yucatan peninsula and we were confined to the hotel\u2019s grounds for 24hrs. During that time we were excluded from the beach due to the high waves (I\u2019ve seen lower surf in Cornwall!!!) and the staff went out of their way to keep guests informed and at ease. The animation team too did their bit during the evening to try to keep the atmosphere light. As it transpired, other than washing half the beach away and raining for a few hours, the hurricane never quite got to Playa del Carmen, but caused a little more damage in Cancun. This, and the high humidity, are the price you pay for going to the Caribbean at this time of the year. Health wise, we both had very minor stomach upsets for about 24hrs so nothing to worry about. One tip for those travelling at this time of the year is, carry a small plastic bag when walking in your swimming kit and carrying a camera: we got caught in such a torrential downpour that I had to claim a new video camera when we got back because ours actually filled-up with water!!

Overall we had a great time, but maybe our expectations were too high having read other reviews. The food and service at the hotel is every bit as good as described in other reviews. I don't think we have ever seen such efficient bar staff. All the staff work extremely hard, and are always friendly and helpful. The pools are very nice and are kept very clean at all times, but as mentioned in other reviews most sunbeds have towels on them by 8am. Most sunbeds are in the shade for much of the day, and there isn't a great deal of room to move them into the sun. Having said that the sun is incredibly strong, so maybe they are trying to save me from myself!! The racoons in the grounds are very much a highlight and will take fruit from your hand. However, be warned that if you venture into racoon territory you will be bitten by mosquitos in places you didn't think mosquitos would go! The rooms themselves were a bit of a disappintment. One room was extremely smelly, but the hotel could not offer two alternative rooms close together, so we coped with it my leaving the ceiling fan on at all times, which reduced the smell a little. The shower in one room was broken and had to be hand held. The drinks optic and wadrobe door was also broken. None of these things mattered hugely, but we had arrived expecting higher standards. The biggest disappointment for us was the beach. We had been fooled by the photos on Thomson's website, which we have subsequently discovered show photos of before the 2005 hurricanes, and had expected a large white sand beach. In reality most of the beach was wahed away and there was only a few feet of sand between the palm trees and the sea. During our stay the last of this was eroded away too, so now there is no unshaded beach available, and some of the palm trees are falling into the sea. If you are looking for large white sand beaches this is not the hotel for you! Tulum and Xel-ha was a nice day. Tulum beach has also been affected by the hurricanes, and is now much smaller. If you are going to Xel-ha take mosquito repellant - it will make your day less painful! Also bear in mind that this trip, and most others, can be booked much cheaper in Playa del Carmen - we saved 50 USD per person on the price charged by the Thomson reps. You also travel in smaller groups by booking in the town. The Fat Cat Katamaran trip was the best trip - fantastic staff on board, and a boat trip that has made some effort to be different from the others.

Let me tell you a little bit about what you need to know. We booked through Portland and flew with Thomson - still received same service as uses same reps but we found this cheaper. The flight out was fine. Some people's screens weren't working but they were able to move due to the plane not being full. We saw the upgrade seats and having done it last year with first choice we were relieved not to have spent the extra money as it just did not seem as superior as it should for the money. Coming home was a nightmare as none of the tvs worked and it was therefore impossible to drown out the screaming children for 9 hours. The meals were adequate but i just felt that the staff could not be bothered. When they came round after the 2 hour rest period, they looked like they had had more sleep than me from the state of their hair! All in all flight was a poor show. The hotel was briliant. The reps Hayley and Paul were fantastic. The rooms are very clean and airy and have everything you could need. The chambermaids are efficient and we left a small tip every two days or so and were very looked after. The pools are large and there is a nice split between one with the activities and one more peaceful. The variety of food is great and there is something for everyone - although i find it is often overrated - yes it is nice but i think it is simply the variety and presentation which is fantastic, not the actual cooking itself. The steakhouse is well worth a visit as is the Mexican and we were able to book these often as late as 9.30am. Otherwise we did it when we went on excursion and had to be up anyway. We did five excursions and found them all to be fantastic. Chichen Itza is a must-see. We walked round in 100 degree heat and althought it was hot, it could not be underestimated. Xcaret is a great trip to do and one you can do yourselves (taxi is $12 each way) and the park itself is great with underground rivers and lots of animals to see. We went on a catermaran trip which was also briliant and the snorkelling was fantastic. The Fat Cat tean were so welcoming and made sure you always had a drink in your hand. The sorkelling continued at Xel-Ha, which was a great day out and the all-inc package is a must. Finally we went on Captain Hooks dinner cruise which was the BEST trip.

Originally booked the Tequila for all 8 days, but while we were there the hotel offered us our last 2 days to be spent at the RIU Palace Mexico. Not sure why they did this, there was no \"catch\" to it. The Palace was absolutely wonderful and so picture perfect...as I am a photo nut! If we had it to do over, we would have stayed at the Palace and paid the extra money. However, for the price the Tequila is a nice place. My husband and I traveled with our two sons 17 & 10 yrs old. Really the only problems we had at the Tequila were very minor (having to call the desk multiple times for requests like to spray the room for misquitos, extra blankets/pillows, toilet paper the maid forgot to leave, virtually empty refrigerator upon check-in) However, not frustrating enough to really be upset over....it just seemed to take two calls to get this stuff taken care of. The room: okay, didn't really care for no door on the shower area of the bathroom, but got used to having the curtain there and closing it and just making sure the kids knew when someone was in there changing or whatever. We also got used to the two beds being pushed together. The surroundings at the resort...very nice, lots of greenery /plants...if you want absolutely stunning surroundings go to the palace. The pools are very nice at the Tequila.....hard to get good spots under the papalas without getting up and making your claim by 8am though. The no reserving seats is not followed at all here, although it seemed to be more followed at the palace since it was easy to get a shaded umbrella spot there even early in the afternoon. Both resorts have lots of activities throughout the day, although we spent alot of our time at the beach. The beach..beautiful...beautiful. Getting there from the tequila took a bit longer than from the palace, but really that would not keep me from choosing one hotel over the other....except for the kids....I would feel a bit more comfortable with the older ones going to the beach alone from the palace since it is very close, rather than the tequila....that way you can easily check on them. The beach in front of the yucatan is kind of rocky, but you can always go over in front of the palace beach where it is nice and sandy. If you stay at the palace waiters come around the beach with drinks for you and you can use the hammocks on the beach also. The shows...only one we saw was Michael Jackson and it was good. we were so wiped out by 9:30 we went to bed early every day and couldn't stay up late enough to watch the shows. The Food....VERY good at both resorts! Palace has a bit more elegance about it, but couldn't complain about either. We did try the steakhouse at the tequila and if you don't like well done steaks, don't bother.....I think that is the only way they cook them. The kids ended up going to the buffet that evening for a second dinner. The buffet has a nice variety and we didn't bother going to any other specialty restaurants at either resort. None of us got diarhhea or sick at all. The kids loved the ice cream at lunch and dinner and if you come back without gaining weight....you are certainly better than we are :o) Excursions....we did the snorkeling adventure at Maroma beach through apple vacations/lomas travel and it was very nice although it was too windy to do the spinnaker so we didn't get that part. We went to Xel-ha and the kids really liked it...especially the jumping off the cliff which they did like 50 times. We also went parasailing at the beach which was awsome...I thought it would be scary but it wasn't at all. My youngest son was afraid to go but came back with a huge smile and was fine going with my older son....they loved it. One other thing....we noted that there were more travelers from USA at the Palace (seemed to be the majority) where at the Tequila we were more in the minority it seemed.

Briefly, we took into account accomodation, food/drinks quality, surroundings, beach, service and entertainment. Very good: food and drinks. Good: service. and surroundings. Average: entertainment Bad: accomodation Very bad: beach. We found the accomodation bad because of the tired look of the room, the sick green color of walls, the constant musty smell, the rusty shower rods, the mold in the shower stall and the lack of ventilation in the toilet room. Also the TV reception was horrible for such a resort: no channel could be seen clearly. Apparently, the beach quality is not Tequila 's fault, but the Riu chain itself posts Yucatan and Playacar beach pictures from 4-5 years ago, which are misleading for travelers.

We tried the Steakhouse which was good, plenty of food and they even gave us extra salads without us requesting.

The beach - very busy but not as bad as I thought it would be. there was plenty of room for the kids to play and that was what we were mainly looking for. The only disappointment was the kids club.

We liked the drape between the bedroom and the bathroom for changing. We had no musty room odor whatsoever. The beds are very firm and they give 2 hard pillows and 2 soft. I requested 2 more of the soft and they were delivered promptly. Nice balcony with pull out rack for drying swimwear. Recieved towel art several times to the delight of my children. Pool-The pool is divided by the restaurant with a swimup bar on one side. Games are played on the non swim upbar side. Excellent staff and very clean pool with in pool loungers. Also there is a \"sandy beach\" area for volleyball & ping pong. Plenty of loungers for everyone. I am sure that is not the case during spring break but for June there was no problem finding a chair. Grounds-beautiful! I do not think there is a bad room at the hotel. The pool is in the center so easy access for everyone to the pool area. Very tropical and gives you a sense of privacy within a large resort. Food- very good,wide variety, truly you have to really be a picky eater in order to complain. Waiters are very friendly and quick with your drinks. Beach-considering Wilma took out quite a bit of the beach we found it to be quite nice. Room enough for the kids to build sandcastles! You have free access to the boogyboards and kayak. Always found a lounger. There are several people who go topless both at the pools and the beach so be sure to discuss this with your children so no one is taken by surprise. Playa del Carmen-This is such a lovely area! It is very secure. You go thru a gate with a watchman to verify that you are allowed into the Playacar Resort section. Upon entering your resort there are gatemen to verify your ID bracelet.

The room is quite nice but dated (especially the shower stall). But....the smell was so bad (worse than musty) that we couldn't sleep the fist night. By 2 a.m. we decided to turn off the AC and leave the ceiling fan on and the balcony door open. It was hot, but...the smell dissipated in 1/2 hour. The bad air in the room is probably due the the AC ducts which could be full of mold because of the humidity. In the end we couldn't live without the AC so we had to (more or less) adapt. At home, when we opened the suitcases, the nauseating smell invaded the house. Everything had to be washed or dry cleaned immediately. The beach was probably the greatest disappointment. They send you to the Yucatan, which is a joke for a beach lover: small, badly eroded and extremely crowded. We ended up by taking the longer walk to the Riu Playacar beach which has a lower portion almost intact. With a little effort (bringing down the lounge chairs ourselves) we could enjoy the magnificent colors of the Caribbean Sea while being able to move around the lounge chairs without bumping into someone else.

One day we made the reservation for the La Lupita restaurant, but it was nothing special and on the other days we went to the Jalisco.

Had a lovely holiday there! Another all-inclusive winner! The resort is very nicely laid out, simple to get around with the pool being in the middle and 2 story level hotel buildings all around it, with the lobby, buffet, show stage, disco, sports bar all located in the front of the complex. Rooms- Rooms were basic nice with a patio or balcony. Beds were 2 double beds pushed together to make 1 big one. Were a little hard but always slept real well until all the jungle birds woke me up in the morning. Had a refridgerator filled with beer,soda,and water that they refilled every other day. It even had a liquor dispensor on the wall if you didn't get enough all day! The shower had very little pressure and hard to regulate. Also had mosquitoes in room and was bitten up one night. Had front desk have them spray room and was ok after that. No big deal it's Mexico! Pool- Very nice large pool! The lunch buffet split the pool in half with one side being the swimup bar and the other side is where the activities happened. Spent most of the time on swimup bar side. Also used the pools at the Playacar and Yucatan also very nice. Restaurants and entertainment- The buffet food was probally some of the best I have ever had at an all-inclusive resort! The dinner buffet was large and always great food with lots of variety. Alot of the same thing daily but always somehing good to eat! If you don't gain weight here you just weren't hungary! You could also eat breakfast and lunch at the RIU Playcar and RIU Yucatan across the street by the beach. Very good just like Tequila! They have 2 order off the menu restaurants. The steakhouse which is the lunch buffet during the day and the Mexican which is shared by the Yucatan. Both very good meals! Only thing you need to make reservations early in the morning in front of the buffet if want to eat there! The entertainment is like most resorts, some of the dance shows are good and the audience partisapation shows are not very good! the best show was the Michael Jackson impersonator and the Mayan dance show. Shows don't start until 9:45pm and last until about 10:30. The disco is right beside the stage but don't open until 11:00pm. The disco is small and is shared by all 5 RIU hotels in area. Bars- Plenty of bars with Corona beer and pretty good drinks with the best being Dr. funk and pina colada. Beach-The Tequila does not have its own beach and is about a 5-10 minute walk to the Yucatan beach which is real big with lots of chairs. I think this is the only reason Apple only gives it a 4 gold apple instead of a 5 gold apple like the Yucatan and the Playacar. They are all similar except the beach. The Playacar beach is a little eroded though. Grounds- The grounds are very well kept! Alot of funny looking tame animals walking around the area. Lots of mosquitoes also! You may want to pack some repellent. Tours- We took 1 tour to Coba Mayan ruins an all day trip. Alot of walking and very hot because you are in the middle of the jungle. You can also climb the Coba ruin which is 139 feet high! Only made half way a little afraid of heights! Lunch is provided and was good. They also take you to a small town where locals live, that part they could have left out but the rest was worth the money $84 US. Playa Del Carmen is about a 2 mile walk from the hotel or a $5 cab ride. Lots of shopping and nightlife! Also have shopping closer to hotel at a place called Mexican street. Overall the tequila was very nice for the money. It was about $200 per person cheaper than Yucatan and Playacar with the only real difference being not on the beach. If you are from US or Canada and want to be around english speaking people you may want to consider the Playacar where it was mostly US and Canada where as the Tequila was mainly Europeans. Didn't matter to me except maybe some of the Europeans were a little pushy at the buffets. The service was maybe the best of any all-inclusives I have visited yet! They really take care of you there and a few tips for the workers is always a nice jesture! If you really want somthing nice and spend lots of money go to the RIU Palace. We met some people that were staying at the palace visiting the Tequila pool and said it was boring over there and that's why they came there. For my money I'll take the Tequila!

We got a last minute sell off and all four of us went for $3600.00 taxes in. (couldn\u2019t pass it up!!) Check -in - This was great. We arrived early at 9am and were in the lobby at 11am. They briefed all of us who got off the bus together and told us to come back at 3pm for our rooms. Traveling with 2 kids made this quite difficult as they wanted to get stuff out of their suitcases and get settled. I gave the guy at the front desk 20.00 and he was nice enough to give us a room right away. We were thrilled. We were in building 34 which is near the front of the resort but back a bit from the pool area. Would have preferred a building closer to the main walkway, but beggers can\u2019t be choosers!! Room - The room was basic and small but met all our needs. The patio overlooked the gardens and it was very quiet. Never heard a peep all night long. The beds were very hard as were the pillows but we managed. They had the two double beds pushed together and asked us if we would like a cot. This worked out great and we were very comfortable.. Everything in the room worked great and the bar was stocked every other day. On one occasion my husband went to the main bar to get a couple of Coronas as we were out in the room and before we knew it there was a guy at the door with 8 more for our fridge and we didn\u2019t even ask. That\u2019s service!! Grounds - Beautiful. Lush and very private. No evidence of hurricane damage at the resort. The pools are large and the water is very nice. The swim up bar was a big hit with the kids. The layout of the resort is exactly what I like. I am not into the high-rise hotels. I really like the villa style resorts where there are lots of individual bungalows and no elevators. We never had an issue getting lounge chairs and most days we didn\u2019t get to the pool until 9:30-10am. Lots of chairs were \u201creserved\u201d, but there were still plenty to choose from. Beach - The beach has definitely become smaller since my last visit it 2004 and in some places there is barely anything left. The beach in front of the Yucatan is large and is almost in 2 levels as there is a slight drop as you get closer to the water. We walked down the beach a couple of hotels and found the beach at the Iberostar to be even better. We went to the beach on only 3 days as the kids loved the pool and activities. We went later in the day and had no problem finding chairs at all, although it was still crowded with lots of people. The water was lovely and no need for water shoes. The sand is very soft. Weather - We lucked out and had beautiful weather the entire time. Our last full day, April 26th was cloudy, but nothing that would keep you inside. Food - Amazing. Can\u2019t say enough. My daughter is a vegetarian and there were plenty of choices for her. Breakfast is the best with made to order omelettes and fresh doughnuts they cook right in front of you. Dinners at he buffet were great. We only ate at one specialty restaurant, the Mexican at the beach. Had to get up for 7am to make same day reservations and that was a pain, but I did do it once. Food was great. Steakhouse didn\u2019t appeal to us anyway. The buffet was great and we never tired of it. Entertainment - Totally enjoyed the entertainment. My kids loved the evening shows, especially the Michael Jackson show. All the staff work so hard and they are incredibly talented people. There dancing skills are out of this world. It was really something to watch. Shows start at 9:45 and end around 10:30-10:45 which was late enough for us. Never hit the disco so can\u2019t tell you about that. However, this is definitely not a party hotel and there were very few groups of young singles...very few. This resort caters to families and couples and is not a party scene. Also there were lots of nationalities represented as well. Tours - having been there once I was aware of the Collectivo so I didn\u2019t pay for any tours. We took the Collectivo to Xel-Ha for 10.00 for all 4 of us and paid out own way in. Saved a bundle. They\u2019d drop you right off at the main entrance and it\u2019s a 10 min walk in maximum. We also took the collectivo to Tulum for 10.00 for all 4 of us and paid our way in there which was only $4.50 each. This is definitely the way to travel. Saved lots of money and got to ride with all the local people. It was great. We just went into Playa and grabbed the Collectivo in there. Playa was great. Went in a couple of times. Lots of shops and stuff. Had pizza and beer in town. Loved the atmosphere. Would love to stay in town if it was just a couple, but the resort is better if traveling with kids for sure. This was an amazing resort and I have lots to compare it with. I have stayed at Grand Palladium Colonial, Iberostar in Dominican, Grand Lido in Jamaica, Hawaii and many others. However, this was my first trip taking the kids and this resort was amazing in every way. Staff, service, food, amenities were all Top Notch. I would recommend this hotel to anyone and will definitely return if the price is right again!!

We are so glad we chose the Tequila over its sister hotels; the Yucatan is certainly not worth the extra money - it was overcrowded (with Spring Breakers) and not as well kept as the Tequila. The Tequila is only a 5 minute walk from the beach so don't let that put you off. The pool area is great at the hotel; a mix of relaxation or activity dependent on which pool you choose! The animation team kept my sports mad hubby entertained allday while I soaked up the rays so it was an ideal holiday all round! We would definitely go back to the Tequila as we really couldn't fault it; Being a young couple, this hotel gave us everything we needed; free flowing alcohol (local and international brands), excellent choice of food and great service....and it's only a 5 minute taxi into Playa Del Carmen for a great night out!!

Food - is great, yes you do get the same food over a 2 week period but this is the same in hotels around the world. There are plenty of bars cafes in town reasonably priced. Rooms - we like the way there is a dressing area at the back between the bed and the shower room. They may be a little tired now but they are comfortable. Many may smell a bit musty but you are in a tropical country humidity is high which causes the smell. take a small airfreshner with you. Pool & pool bar - both fab, pool clean, bar staff friendly. Entertainment - evening mainly based around shows, we tend to take a deck of card and a game or two with us which has been great when meeting new friends. Full daytime entertainment and games but the staff are not pushy if you do not want to join in. Staff - They really can't do enough to help. Anything missing just ask and it will be soon rectified. Hotel grounds - some trees came down in the hurricanes, we were there when Wilma hit and some of the wildlife was sadly lost. But the grounds people work really hard and keep it looking nice even after a storm/hurricane. Beach - nice sandy beach yes a little smaller now due to the damage caused by the storms etc. normally plenty of chairs and staff on hand to help you relocate on if required. Anyone looking for a getaway relaxing quiet beach holiday the Tequila is about having fun, therefore yes sometimes it can be a little noisy, the hotel location is brilliant near town, they cater for families very well but if you want peace and quiet, please don't moan or complain go somewhere else.

The bits I can remember are that the hotel was spotlessly clean, food was better than excellent with a fantastic choice, there were outdoor barbeques on occassions and you got every meat you could think of. The buffett section was amazing, great choice from salad counter, to fast food e.g. pizza, chips etc., to mexican with tortillas, fajita's etc., to english with casserole, mash, vegetables etc. There were impressive food and ice sculptures in the dining room. There were speciality restaraunts which were very good, the most memorable was the one outside by the pool which provided a very pretty setting but the meal was stunning, soup for starters, salmon and steak for main course followed by chocolate pudding for desert accompanied by wine, beers etc., and all made nice by excellent service with displays of food preparation. Pool was fantastic, huge, with swim up bar which was great (bit smelly but think that's swim up bars for you, oh and it got lots of wasps too around both the swim up bar and kids drinks machines but they didn't bother you). Pool did get bit grubby throughout day but was constantly being cleaned. Rooms were good size with comfortable beds, good air con., good size bathroom and dressing area. Drinks were good, plenty of choice and tasted good to me, especially the Tequila boom booms and mexican flags, just don't have too many!! Save best till last I think - entertainment was out of this world. I would have paid to see shows like this and not been disappointed. There was a Michael Jackson impersonator, which was my favourite but hard to choose really the entertainment team really were fantastic. My favourite night was when the kids club and joined up with entertainment and put on a kids version of Grease musical before presenting the show themsevles, the crowd roared it was brilliant. There is also a disco area which before a certain time serves as a cinema for kids to go in and watch movies. There is a little complex within walking distance of the hotel with shops etc., which is really nice to walk around some nights to avoid feeling landlocked. The beach is the most stunning beach i've seen, really clean and crystal blue sea, doesn't matter that it's not by the pool you just catch a regular buggy from outside hotel and it runs you a 2 minute journey through a lovelly tree lined pathway to the beach and brings you back again.

We loved the hotel, the weather was beautiful and we managed to do some great days out, too. The food was fantastic, with masses of choice, and you could basically eat around the clock if you wanted. It is true that you have to be queuing way before 7am if you want to visit one of the speciality restaurants - we managed it the first few days and although we liked the steakhouse, we really weren't that impressed with the Mexican restaurant, which is overlooking the beach at the Yucatan - neither the service nor the food was great. In the main restaurant at night, there was only one night out of the 12 we ate there when I didn't think it was very good - but I still managed to find something to eat. As others have said, breakfast is wonderful, but I also enjoyed the lunches. Yes, there's the usual fast-food fare of hot-dogs, burgers and pizza, but there were also tons of salads, soup, at least four meat dishes and lots of vegetables. However, I agree that vegetarians aren't particularly well catered for. The hotel was built in 1998, so although the rooms are a little dated now, by no means are they as old as some other reviewers seem to claim. Ours was fine - and we didn't find the beds/pillows too hard at all. It was spotlessly clean, and was cleaned to the highest standards every day. We found every member of staff to be exceptionally friendly and willing to help, and no one seemed to expect to be tipped, unlike the staff in AIs I have visited in Jamaica! We never had to wait long at the bars for service either, despite the hotel being very busy in the run-up to Easter. The only downside is the distance from the beach - but my children prefer the pool anyway, so it wasn't a problem for us.

We had a great time. We took our kids 17 and 14 and our oldest son and his girlfirend 23. There is a great disco at the Tequila, our youngest was even allowed in as long as he was with us. They had a sports bar with pool tables, airhockey, fooseball and computers for access to the internet. It was a bit expensive for the pool tables and computers but you don't spend a lot time on the net while you're there ( or your missing the point of being on a holiday). The kids spent a quite a bit of time in the sports bar. There is a great outside bar overlooking the performance stage. There is a kids performance every night before the show - it's a bit annoying because they do the same thing every night. The shows: some were really good, one was just pathetic (It was a spoof on the last night). The weather wasn't too bad. We had rain for a few days. The beach was awsome! The walk there isn't more than 10 minutes and it's actually a really nice walk. There is also a cart they run back and forth all the time but by the time you wait for it to arrive you could have walked there. There were enough chairs but if you want to be at the front you'll need to get there early, which I think you need to expect at any resort. Food in the buffet was fairly good but often the same. The Mexican restaurant was okay but not spectacular and the Steakhouse restaurant was good. They made us share the Caesar salad between two, which I thought was strange. The only downside of our trip was the activity we chose. We ended up picking the speed boats / snorkling with the turtles. WARNING: If you have a bad back - don't do this trip! The day of our trip the water was so choppy that we were slamming down on the water continuously - it was horrible! We ended up quitting halfway through the trip after an 11 year old slamed her head on the front of the boat and ended up injured. They took us into the bay and whisked her and her family away. I told them we wouldn't be continuing along with another couple. It took them 2 1/2 hours to get a van out to pick us up. Then they were only going to give us a 25% rebate. I argued with them and they finally issued a 50% rebate. Our family then ended up going to XeHa - and it was spectacular! I highly recommend it - especially if you have kids with you! It was cheaper than Xcaret and when it said \"all-inclusive\" it was - food & drink. Do it early in the week though because it is a very tiring trip - but sooooo worth it! The resort was great - but I have to say the rooms smelt musty at times - we changed rooms once but experienced the same in the next room - it helps if you have the airconditioning going - but not the fan. One last thing - it was my husband's 40th birthday and we went to the Steakhouse for it. I asked if the staff could sing or something for him and they readily agreed. They brought him a cake and sang for him - it was excellent!

We are regular travellers, this is not our first AI hotel (sometimes when you read those good reviews it is from people who never been on AI and everything is peachy) and recently have been to the Riu Taino in DomRep, Barcelo in Mayan, Iberostar Cuba. First of all, if you are a beach person DO NOT EVEN THINK about this hotel or any of other Riu's in Playa. This was a huge let down for us since we love spending time at the beach. We watched it disappear more and more every day, after 10 days the Palace's beach was pretty much gone, you could not walk in, not even jump down, it became so high. Getting the same way at the Yucatan too. Palmtrees were falling every day, it was terrible. Playacar, not worth talking about and Yucatan getting worse and worse too. Like I said this was happening in the matter of days so I imagine it will only get worse. We asked the manager what are they doing about it and his answer was: \"What is the mexican government doing about it? It is their beach, not ours.\" Well, yes but whose guests is everybody???? The only beach you could still use and somewhat enjoy was the Yucatan but it was so small and so crowded that sometimes it was hard to even walk down to the water, sunbeds were touching each other, packed, packed packed. Absolutely not nice. I will repeat this again: if you like the beach this is not a place for you. I am serious. The water is very rough, not recommended for families with young kids. We talked to several families who were quiet unhappy about this. It is just too dangerous for kids and because there is no wide sand section you can't even let them sit down and play in the sand. When we walked over to the Iberostar beach it was a whole different story. They had nice wide sandy beaches with lots of room and privacy and kids playing by the water. Much nicer for sure. If you like to snorkel, also not a place for you. There is nothing to see here. My husband went to Cozumel twice and loved it. Took a cab to playa and ferry from there. Cheap and easy. The walk to the beach is really not a big deal, we did not mind it and did take the cart couple times too. It does not run between 1-3pm. The resort is nice, not big at all. Not worth trying to spend time or eat at the other Riu's, this one is the nicest. The pool especially, the others were way too busy with very little room. The rooms are old but clean and sufficient. However, the hallways are extremely echoi, we were woken up an average 2 times per night. People did not even have to be loud, it just carried the sound very badly. This was quiet upsetting. No, we did not want to go to bed at 9 pm, usually around 11 pm after the show so it was not cool to have to listen people talking and slamming doors at night or even having sex. Yes, you read it right, that too. For these reasons we would NEVER go back to this hotel. These are not things the hotel can fix unfortunately. Grounds were nice, staff extremely friendly, the service was top notch, no complaints at all. Drinks- frozen drinks are non exsisting and not very good either. Pina colada is something different there, too much pineapple and not much coconut. But we knew this, all AI-s are pretty much like this. Food- like any other AI, nothing better, nothing worse. Not much to rave about. Breakfast probably the best, lunch pretty much the same every day so quiet boring, not enough variety and too much junk like hot dogs and burgers. Dinner OK, also gets repetitive but that's normal after 2 weeks. Desserts not very good and NOT ENOUGH veggies. Since I had a toddler who loves veggies this was a problem. And the ones they had were too hard, not cooked enough for her to chew. One negative comment about the staff, the headwaiters by the door at night. They are quiet rude actually. They way they talk to you and handle you (stop you by the door, wait for the table etc) is really uncomfortable. Not that they stop you or want to give you a table but the way they handle you. You will see what I mean. Who is the guest here??? Shows- have seen worse but better as well, like at the Barcelo. It wasn't so entertaining, could have had more funny stuff. Also it starts waaay too late, 9.45 pm. Kids club, ours is too small for it but it seemed to be good for the kids, they liked it. They are VERY nice to kids there we noticed, always tried to communicate with my daughter, always had a smile for her etc. For people with small kids: They give you a crib if you ask but take your fitted sheet. I wished I did. Take your stroller. Don't bother with diapers or babyfood, they have everything at Walmart in Playa. Lots of sunscreen. Kidspool is okay, bit dirty, no shade though. Lots of sunscreen. Food is okay for them but like I said veggies is the issue. They have highchairs (with tray) in each restaurant. To drink the bottled water they provide. There is sandtoys at the kidsclub but we brought our own for the beach. There is a lot of kids and I am happy we brought ours, there was no issue, she never got sick and had a good time. She is still on formula so we brought that (and a bottlewarmer) but I heard from people they asked for milk in the minibar and they always got it. Or you would have to take some from Breakfast. Take some dishwasher soap. Flying was long but you just get through it, ours slept way less then at home like she would wake up at 6-6.30 am every morning and have a morning nap in the stroller so we would not be stuck in the room. Now she is back to normal though. Anyways, like I said I would not go back to this hotel, I do not see why people are so happy with it, I found the Taino and the Barcelo better.", "Date": "April 10, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "maryland", "Title": "\u201cCompares Well to Others in Riviera Maya!\u201d", "Author": "img1972", "ReviewID": "UR7304554", "Content": "We (2 adults & 2 kids, ages 7 and 6) visited the Tequila in early April for 9 nights.

Key Differentiators between Riu & Others: 1. Service - at the Riu, service is top notch, from room cleaning, to the wait staff & bartenders to the staff who pick up the cups and plates around the pools. 2. Animation team - the best thus far. If you're into activities, you won't run out of things to do (note - this is particulary true at the Rui Yucatan, which we spent most of our time at during the day because of the beach access). Kids programs at the Tequila in the evenings are awesome - our kids loved it, and met many new friends over the course of our stay. Beach was great - some beach erosion, but the water was clean & the sand was soft - not much to complain about! Food, drink etc... about the same as other all inclusives.

We were there from March 17 through to March 31, 2007. The resort is beautifully planted, with lots of lush vegetation everywhere. The service was fantastic and the food choice was varied. We at no time found ourselves lacking for anything. The rooms are a nice size, with the 2nd floor rooms having cathedral ceilings, adding to the illusion of size. The balconies are a good size and have the Riu expandable, drying rack on them, a very handy feature.The short walk down to the beach only took us 6 minutes at a leisurely pace, the whole time sheltered under arbors. The tram only takes a couple of minutes should you go that route and is on a load and go system, rotating 2 trams. There is a nice shopping area just a 2 minute walk to the left as you leave the resort - the Plaza Playacar. It has a nice selection of stores and there are a few on the Mexican Street over at the Yucatan. The walk into town only took 25 minutes again at a leisurely pace, or you can grab a cab at the hotel main entrance for just $5.00US each way. Where they drop you off, for the return trip you will find lots of drivers across the street waiting for you. The shopping in Playa del Carmen and in Cozumel is fantastic. The vendors are not too bad - Jamaica is far worse. There seems to be a jewelry store at every turn and their prices seem good - don't forget to barter for everything at these stores. The tours offered by our tour operator can be had more cheaply by going in town to Sergio's or at the GrayLine kiosk at the Plaza Playacar - ask for Angel there. On the whole, we have always liked where we have vacationed and have made the best of our time and taken advantage of what the various areas have had to offer. This was no exception here. We took the ferry to Cozumel, toured Chichen Itza, Tulum, Xel Ha, Coba, Xcaret and enjoyed them all. We have liked other places in the past, but not to the extent we would return to the same resort, if we returned to the same destination. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Riu Tequila and for the first time have said it is a resort we would go back to.

The rooms - completely adequate, smell great :), firm beds (I love that!) and plenty of room. Not to mention - it is so wonderful to return to your room at the end of a hot beach day to a cold Corona. The food - great variety - especially at dinner. The omelets were wonderful as were the fresh juices. I want one of the coffee machines in my home! The Steakhouse was very good. Activities - shows were good, dancers were amazing. We spent our days primarily at the pools on the beach and at the beach, so didn't spend a lot of time at the Tequila pools, but they were lovely. Room selection - we had a first floor room and a second floor room. I would recommend a second floor room. The breeze was constant (we like our slider open) and the ceilings vaulted which made the rooms seem larger. The Tequila is great for parents travelling with older teenagers. In the evening, you can watch the shows and sit in the area outside the bar and keep and eye on your teens as they go into the Sports Bar and disco. Just adds a little bit of accountability for them, and since the area is open-air, it's relaxing and wonderful for you too! The resort is beautiful.

The grounds are lovely - lots of trees and a jungle feel which we much prefer to the highly manicured landscaping of many resorts. The pool area is quite lovely, except you have to watch out for those blackbirds. This is a great resort for families. The vibe is much more mellow than the other sister resorts (Playacar and Yucatan) - no spring breakers here. Just a lot of families enjoying a pleasant day in the sun. For younger kids, they have a daylong program which, judging from the enthusiasm of the kids, is quite successful. The rooms are simple but quite clean. The mattresses are pretty stiff but I'll take that over smooshy, lumpy mattresses! The fridge full of soda and water was kept well-stocked. The food was quite good for the kind of buffet they laid out each night. Lots and lots of choices - Mexican, American, kid-friendly, pasta. Overall, I thought they did a great job. The Mexican specialities were particularly delicious - something new every day and some of it even had a substantial kick to it. We ate at both of the speciality restaurants and they were pretty good. The Mexican speciality has a very interesting menu but my husband's pork loin was overcooked a bit. My fish was fantastic though, as was my daughter's steak. Every night there is a show and we enjoyed them a lot. They are a bit campy sometimes but the dancers were great.

My family of 4, mom, dad, and 2 kids age 8 and 11, all had a good time. We all want to go back. First, the down sides. Both kids got Montezuma's revenge, as did some other vacationers we knew. It lasted about a day, and didn't really dampen anyone's spirits. They still want to go back. Second, the placed was booked, there were a few high school spring breakers who were drinking age, and that was a bit of a negative. We got up at 7:00 a.m. a few mornings to exercise, and it was disappointing to see all the debris and trash left over from a night of partying. However, the Mexican workers were out in full force at that time, picking up the garbage, sweeping, and mopping up the place, transforming it back into the wonderful place it is. The landscaping is beautiful, and has nice tile work throughout the resort. The pools are excellent, and we love the fact that it has a pool bar, and the morning snack and lunch are at La Lupita, which is right at the pools. Our kids could swim up to the pool bar and get a beverage, or go get a snack whenever they wanted. We basically cut them loose, and they had lots of autonomy, and LOVED it! The food was excellent. There was always a wide selection of items, and always had fresh fruits and vegetables. You can eat very healthy if you choose to. We ate lots of fruits and veggies, and they were always fresh, ripe, perfect! There was also a lot of tasty treats. For example, each morning, they fried donuts right on the spot. Those were impossible to pass up. Each morning, they always had a juicing station, where a worker juices up oranges, pineapple, melon, etc. The sit down dinners which required a reservation were fine, but you didn't get any better of a meal. It is a nice change of pace to sit down and be served as opposed to the buffet. The beach is about a 15 minute walk, which is OK. Judging from old pictures, it appears that they lost SEVERAL feet of beach in hurricane Wilma. It is just plain gone. We didn't spend much time at the beach at all, we were very content with the pool, pool bar, and snacks right at Riu Tequila. We had a fantastic time. We spent a lot of time deciding if it was worth the extra cost for an all inclusive. My answer: YES!!!!! We never carried money, the kids had free run of the place, got drinks and snacks whenever they liked, it was awesome. Totally worth it!

The nightly entertainment was very good too.

They even arranged a tour for my wife to see kitchen and how the food is prepared. Buffet was excellent with more items that one can eat and above all they some how managed to change menu almost everyday to keep it interesting. Rooms were very clean except for some mosquitos. they have small fridge with cold drinks( complimentry) and lots of free alcohol in rooms if you like to drink.

There is a swim up bar and staff does not harass you to participate in poolside activities. As some reviewers complained about beds we were somewhat concious but we found beds to be not ant different then most north american hotels. As far excursions, one is probably better off taking a taxi and doning it yourself as we found these to be unnecessarily expensive when bought at hotel. remember if you go to XCARAT and tyour hotel agent tells you that if you but from them you dont have to stand in line at the attrection, they are LYING, there were mant tourist like us who were told that and like us stood in line for 2 hours to get bands.

We were supposed to stay at the Iberostar Paraiso del Mar but changed the dates of our trip and Apple Vacations (who we booked with) gave us the Tequila as an option when the Iberostar was no longer available. Friends of ours had recently stayed at the Riu Palace Mexico and loved it, so we went with the Riu basically because we knew the name. My dissapointment with the Riu is that we did not feel like valued guests. There was a mindset that the Tequila is only the club hotel, if you want anything more than mediocre food, service, rooms, then stay at the Palace. I do understand that you pay for what you get, but I also think that the hotel should take pride in all their properties and they do not do this at the Tequila. I will give examples: The beach towels and room towels were often holey and ripped. The rooms have a distinct smell of mildew and mold. The food is only OK , not a lot of variety and was actually terrible at the Steak house. The walls are so thin we heard everything, including our neighbor that woke every morning vomiting. We had two incidents that turned us off from the Riu Brand: The night we arrived one of the beds in our room was filthy and smelled foul. We complained at the front desk and were nicely told it would be taken care of. We came home the next day and found that they sprayed air freshner, which of course did not take care of the stench of the mattress. We went back and complained and were told that we are the only people that have ever complained about that, and asked \"What do you want me to do?\" and told \"If you want an upgrade or are trying to stay at the Palace then you will have to pay for it \" We were appalled because, this is a hotel, and what can they provide if not a clean place to sleep? Went back again to speak to a manager who was very nice and ended up changing our mattress. We were thankful for that, but of course turned off from the experience. Our other bad expereince happened the morning we were to leave. Apple vacations provided us with a free shuttle and we had to catch it at 4am to get to the airport in time. We called the front desk at 3:30 to ask for the bellhop (what were we thinking?) There was no answer. My Fiance decided he would walk half he bags to the front desk and when he opened the room door he walked into blackness. They apparently turn the lights out at a certain time? He walked in the dark to the front desk. When he arrived no one was there. He came back for me and we brought the rest of the bags- still no one was there. Our van had to leave without us, so we missed our ride to the airport. The sports bar was still open and some people walked in the hotel, but no one was manning the front desk! When the man finally came back and told us he was \"in the bathroom\" we were obviously livid. He had an attitude and was very defensive. He called us a cab, which we had to now pay for. In comparison to our friends stay at the Palace and what we heard from other guests at the Palace we almost felt like we were punished for staying at the lower level hotel. We were not the priority as Riu guests. For me this is a disgusting business model as all guest deserve a clean bed, good food, and a kind service (we were not staying at the Palace but we were also not camping on their beach!) and this does not seem to be the Riu philosophy. I will be in touch with the Riu and hope that they redeem themselves, but next time you can find me at the Iberostar.", "Date": "March 26, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brainerd, MN", "Title": "\u201cHad a great time\u201d", "Author": "Teiger", "ReviewID": "UR7218253", "Content": "We just returned yesterday from our vacation at the RIU Tequila.

The hotel was very nice and clean and the food was fabulous. The walk to the beach was good for us after all the delicious meals. The buffet had enough variety to keep our family more than satisfied for the week. We did both a la carte restaurants and enjoyed them both. One word of advice which was passed on to us as far as the Steak a la carte goes...... order your steaks more well done than you normally would. A medium steak was more like rare and well done was more like medium. You have to line up early to book these restaurants. I lined up one morning at 6:30 to book the Steak Restaurant. Perhaps this was because it was March Break and the resort was very crowded. However, I love this time of the day and had to get up early anyway to save chairs by the pool. Nothing beats an early morning walk on the beach . We took a taxi to Xel-Has instead of paying the price for the excursion through Sunquest which worked out very well. This way we were free to come and go as we pleased. The taxi to Xel-Ha was 36 dollars U.S. The driver was very nice and a very aggressive driver.....typical. We paid to swim with the dolphins for half an hour and we were in with them for about 45 minutes.....thoroughly enjoyable experience. Definitely a highlight for me. The pool at the hotel was very nice and a very comfortable temperature for cooling off. The beach was very crowded but we were always able to find chairs. My husband and daughter went parasailing for 35.00 U.S. and loved every minute of it.The Yucatan has beach but the Playacar has very litttle. Don't hold your breath for the beach shuttle......we tried only twice the whole week to hitch a ride and after waiting first in line for it, people walked up at the last minute and jumped on. This was probably the only bad experience of the week. The walk did us good anyway. We found the beds comfortable in the rooms but we like a firm mattress. Our room was damp and a little musty smelling but you really don't spend much time in there anyway. The staff were always smiling and they never passed us without saying a pleasant Hola. The shows were just O.K. but karaoke night was a lot of fun to watch..........some excellent talent. Beware of the \"passenger assisstants\" when you first arrive at the airport. They will ask you which hotel you are staying at and then ask you to follow them. We fell for this as we thought they were going to lead us to our shuttle. They lead us to a booth where they proceeded to pull out a map and show us where the hotel playacar area was and then pointed out our hotel to us. We still hadn't caught on to them and continued to listen as this was our first trip to Playa del Carmen. Eventually, and now I was getting a little suspicious, they told us about deals they had for us if we toured new hotels. I was getting nervous that we were going to miss our shuttle bus to our hotel so we walked away and made our way to the busses where we found a Sunquest rep. When we did get on our bus we found that the bus was nearly full and had we been much longer they would have left without us. So, one word of advice.......keep on walking until you get to the bus area and then find your tour rep to tell you which bus to get on. Our bus did leave without one couple and I'm sure they were caught up in it too. My husband golfed twice at the Playacar course,.....the front desk booked the tee time for him. It was 104.00 U.S. after 1:00. He found it quite expensive for the course but at least he was GOLFING. This was the cheapest golf around. He was paired up with other golfers when he arrived and he enjoyed their company. We walked to the little plaza which is just to the left when you walk out of the front enterance and we also took a cab to Fifth Avenue in Playa del Carmen. What a happening street...a bit of everything. I took a cab back the next morning by myself and felt quite safe there. I hope this review helps you a bit.

On to our trip when you get off the plane and get through customs there a are a lot of people who will come up to you and take your bags for you . It was our first time to experience this since they took the bag away from my daughter i was not happy about this . If you say you have your bag they give you adirty look and leave you . anyway that was the worst part of the trip. when we got there our rooms were ready and we were staying at the back of the resort . It was a bit of a hike but we needed the walk after meals . the food was good the pasta station at lunch was very good . We made reservations at the steak house but you have to wake up at 600 just to get in line for the 700 meal. We ate there 2 times the second time the meal was not very good. The pool was nice quiet clean pool bar was fun. the beach walk was nice but i would have rather been on the beach side it had more action . The water was very rough the whole time we were there but the kids loved playing in the waves. People with smaller children should take caution with the rough water. My son who is 9 was amazed by the topless women on the beach side . Some flaunted the fact that they were topless. We knew that the beach would have topless women so we were not botherd by it the night time i have to say was very boring there was nothing to do. The kids liked the sports bar they played there every night The kids show was the same every night and the song is now stuck in our heads . My kids found the camp the last 2 days they were there. They had fun but got bored very easy. I guess on the cruise the kids had activities the whole day and night that they could come and go as they pleased. the rooms were very clean and the tile floors can get very slippery when wet. the worst part of the resort was the beds . I cant describe how painful it was to sleep on them if you have any kind of back problems they will get worse if you sleep on them for a week we even asked the front desk if they had something to put on them, they put on a foam topper which didnt help. The trip was good for the amount of money that we payed for it but i guess we are cruise people. On a cruise you have things to keep you busy at night time which is what we like.", "Date": "March 17, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Burke, VA", "Title": "\u201cLoved the Riu\u201d", "Author": "Aussiegirl26", "ReviewID": "UR7162047", "Content": "My mom and I stayed at the Riu from February 17th to the 22nd as a joint birthday trip, my 30th and her 56th.

The shows at the resort were entertaining and the bar seemed to get crowded before and after the nightly entertainment. I thought the resort itself was fairly quiet but was told by some other travelers that this was the place to be for the nightlife out of the Riu, Yucatan and Playacar resorts. The beach at the Yucatan is great and there were always chairs to be found. There is also a nice stretch of beach to walk on in one direction, the other side has been mostly washed away from Hurricanes. The only negative I would give the Riu was that our room was a little damp and cool the first 2 nights but got better as the weather improved.

Pool was clean, grounds are very well kept and the rooms were also clean and enjoyable. I don't know how anyone could NOT have a great time here. The only things we would have liked is for coffee makers in the rooms and for the shows at night to start earlier. The main show doesn't start till 9:45 pm and after a full day we found it hard to stay up and watch. The shows we did see were very good though. I would highly recommend this resort to anyone and would go back in a heartbeat!!! One reminder to guests, the people that work at these resorts do not make much money so you really should tip them. We ran into people that said since it was all inclusive, there was no need to tip!!?? We talked to one employee that told us they make $75 every TWO weeks.

This hotel is in the 3 star class and I would rate it slightly above average. Probably a 3.5. Most of the reviewers who wrote about the pluses and the minuses hit the nail right on the head. Location: This hotel has a great location because it is located near downtown (approx 8 min. cab ride for 5 dollars). You are within a gated community of other hotels and small shopping plaza. For best deals it is better to go downtown to Aveinda Quinta. I went downtown one night for some drinking and dancing with a couple that I met. We went to Mambo cafe and it was fantastic. Salsa, merengue, etc. I always felt safe. Grounds: The grounds of the hotel were beatiful and spacious. It was nice to be able to walk around the resort and all the other resorts as well. The Riu Palace is beautiful. I would definitely want to stay there next time (but of course the prices would be much more). Food: The food was really good at the buffet. For dinner they always changed it up a bit. We did not go the Steakhouse, but we went to the Mexican restaurant. The restaurant was just okay. The buffet was much better. We wound up going downtown one night for dinner at Casa de Agua which was very good. In regards to the other Rius -tequila had the best food selection. One negtive to the food was that if you wanted t get reserveration at a la carte you need to get on line at 7:30am. When I am on vacation I am not a big fan of waking up at 7:30 am to go and stand on a line to get a reservation for a restaurant. Pool and Beach: My one gripe with the pool is the same thing as the restaurant. If you do not put your towel down by 8:30am you will not get a chair. Otherwise, the pool was nice and swim up bar was great. The pool is centrally located so it is always happening. There are staff members that walk around and try to get you involved into the activities which was nice. The beach was very windy and a good 5-8 minute walk. There were times we wanted to go the beach, but we were afraid to leave our chairs at the pool. If the beach was too windy we would want to come back to the pool, but then we would most likely not get our chairs back so that put us in a tight spot. Rooms: Very clean and cleaned everyday; however, very dated. They desperately need some updating. The beds as most reviewers reported were extremely hard. My mom did not seem to mind, but for me the beds had no give. We did mind how smelly the beds were. We asked to be moved to a new room because of the foul smell coming from the beds, but they were unable to accomodate us due to the fact that they were \"fully booked.\" They came and tried to spray, but it only slightly masked the smell. As with most caribbean spots the room was damp with a slight musty smell. We had a leaky fridge which was fixed once we reported it and a good number of mosquitos in the rooms. The safety lock box need 2 people to close it because it was so old. The room key is just that---a key. A big old key attached to a big keychain with your room number printed on it. If you lose your key there is no doubt they will know which room is yours. Tours: We went to Xcaret which was un. We paid a 109.00 fro xcaret plus which included entrance to the park, transportation, free buffet, and snorkel gear. There were so many things to do there. It was a lot of fun. Snorkeling was just ok, it was limited but just enough because there were a lot of activities to do. Beach to relax, shows and animals to see. Staff: VERY FRIENDLY and accomodating. Although I enoyed my stay here, I most likely would not want to do an all inclusive on my next trip. There were too many good restaurants downtown and some cute boutique hotels", "Date": "March 13, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hemel Hempstead", "Title": "\u201cVery good hotel and service - shame about the beds and cold pool\u201d", "Author": "WiiJeff", "ReviewID": "UR7008643", "Content": "The Riu Tequila is an excellent hotel of 4* ranking in my opinion. As with most places there will always be good points and bad points but you should enjoy your stay here. There are lots of nice things to be said for the hotel which have already been said so I will try and focus mostly on points which may you may find useful. We went with Portland Direct holidays, part of Thompson holidays. This works out \u00a3100 per persons cheaper than the Thomson\u2019s price and you get exactly the same services as Thomson\u2019s guests including their rep and transport etc. Not sure why anyone would book through Thomson\u2019s on the more expensive basis? The Thompson representative Angelo is resident at the Hotel many times during the day and it appears this is the only hotel he is required to look after. He appears a genuine guy who really is putting in the extra effort to help his guests. I would say that he is the best rep I have come across to date and provides an excellent service. He set up a meeting at the end of the holiday to inform guests about going home procedures and was very informative and knowledgeable. He cannot be praised enough. This is my 3rd trip to Mexico (different hotel), the hotel staff provide the exceptional service I have come to recognise as a trait of the Mexican people. They all smile and go out of there way to assist and be friendly. Even the front desk were falling over themselves to be friendly and helpful. Contrast this to my experience in Jamaica where the staff in the 5* hotel were helpful but gave the impression they weren't interested and looked down on the guests. The waiters and waitresses worked exceptional hard. Having said that, they never got my air conditioning to work but this small gripe was offset by the whole holiday experience. I simply used the ceiling fan. The animation team have the amazing capability of remembering your name and everyone else's from the first time they are told. Wish I could do that! I did find that during the period we went there were a lot of people interested in the games such as Boca, Shuffleboard, Shooting and volleyball which meant a lot of hanging around waiting for a turn. Having said that, at least the games were being played. The animation team showed great enthusiasm but were not intrusive. The pool was freezing the first couple of days due to an overcast sky. They don't heat it and personally I would pay more for my holiday for a heated pool. Once the sun warms it up it is more manageable but it never really gets warm enough for my taste but it useful if you get too hot playing volleyball. The 'Jacuzzi' is part of the pool and is therefore also cold. No hot tubs here. The pools are just adequate for the volume of guests and didn't appear too overcrowded. Poolside loungers are available and the inevitable annoying early morning towel blocking takes place making it harder to find groups of loungers. After a search though it was usually possible to find somewhere to set out whatever time you went to the pool throughout the day. There were just about sufficient places to get shade. The rooms are basic with free alcoholic and non alcoholic drinks in the room replaced every two days. There is bottled water which is kept in a fridge in the room. I am going to unite with the other reviewers here about the beds. They are not kidding. The beds are the most uncomfortable I have ever slept on. Although they have a 'matress' it feels like you are sleeping on the base without it and the pillows are next to useless. I ended up with a permanent shoulder pain for the latter part of the holiday. I am told by the Management that they intend to revamp the rooms in May during their quiet season. I do hope they fix the beds because whilst I could put up with them once, on reflection it is the thing that would possibly stop me from going back. The food at the Tequila is plentiful, constant and very good. There will always be something you like. Some of the meat is occasionally tough probably due to cheaper cuts and with the volume catered. The range, much of which is cooked in front of you, will keep the vast majority of guests extremely happy. As well as salads, soups, numerous types of bread there is only so many versions of beef, pork, chicken and lamb, you can dream up every night. If you don't like that there is pasta, bolognaise, burgers, hotdogs, pizza etc. You will be sick of food by the end of the fortnight. We went to the Steak 'restaurant\u2019 , and had a very good 5 course meal. Excellent. We went over to the Riu Yucatan and the Tequila is the superior property by far in my opinion . The short walk to the beach is easily manageable. The tram is there and I saw it regularly when I didn't want it but it seemed to be on siesta, full or broken down every time I wanted it. Never got to use it once. That's life. The Yucatan whilst not unpleasant was crowded and lacked the ambience of the Tequila. I was pleased I had read the reviews here first and didn't go there. The beach at the Yucatan has beautiful sand but is a noisy experience. Maybe I am just getting old but for me personally I didn't enjoy the noise and limiting effects for swimming caused by the jet ski's which cause swimmers to be 'penned in' to safe zones. The beach was spoilt by the amount of motorised activity. Don't go to this beach for a peaceful Caribbean style experience. Tried snorkeling there, nothing to see as discussed by others. Loungers in the shade are very hard to find here due to the crowded nature of the beach being used by both Yucatan and Tequila guests. Another reason not to bother with the Yucatan hotel over the Tequila. Friends we were with were excited by the motorised activity so it is your choice as to whether you think this is good or not. I preferred the pool at the Tequila even though the sea was warmer! The evening entertainment, like entertainment elsewhere in similar hotels didn't do it for me and I bowed out leaving the others to watch. There is a children\u2019s dance show involving the guests children every night which is identical every night followed by family entertainment The animation team try really hard and its free so it depends whether you are into amateur shows which involve dancing and miming. I am told the crazy show was the best but I saw the beginning and I just like my humour to be a little more sophisticated. Again, some people must like it because the tables were always busy. The hotel is close to Playa del Carmen shops and there are tons of them spread across a vast area. 5th Avenue is 5USD in a taxi and can be walked in about 25 - 30 minutes at a slow pace. The further out from the tourist 5th avenue you get, the cheaper the prices. Look carefully though and you will see \"made in India\" stickers which demonstrate the global economy in action and mass production. Haggle hard because as our rep pointed out everything is about 60% overpriced. Personally I hate shopping. Cozumel ferry is located next to 5th Avenue. A trip across the water is about 10USD return and provides yet more shops and the opportunity to take a horse an cart for a short journey (40USD expensive for a 30 minute tour but I don't think I haggled hard enough). Just before 5th Avenue there is an excellent beauty spa here called Kristine Playacar. They do massages, manicures, hair cuts, waxing etc. My other half had a French polish on her finger nails for 6USD which she was very pleased with (I am told this was very cheap) and I had an excellent 'deep' massage for 49USD for 1 hour ( it was over a full hour I timed it). This would have been 80USD in the hotel. I was a bit worried when they took me out of the shop and down an alley to a separate room for the massage but it was all above board and really good with piped music. Highly recommended. They do a 'relaxing' massage for 1 hour at 38USD or thereabouts. Someone else mentioned the bird park 10 minutes up the road from the Tequila. We went there. It was expensive at 15USD and takes about 45 minutes to complete. It was very good however because the pathway winds you through a sort of jungle type of environment where you see birds untethered by their environment and the occasional reptile. Only one area is netted to prevent escape. Finally, both Xcaret and Xel-ha (Pronounced shell ha) are within reasonable distance of the hotel by taxi. Xcaret was 20USD each way and Xel-ha 38USD each way. Briefly, both offer opportunities to snorkel. Xcaret is famous for its show but again it didn't do it for me I am afraid and my friends asked me what it was all about? Left before the finale. Food was very good at Xcaret and there are other things to look at like the aquarium, the swim through the cave and the short boat ride in a loop. The problem here is that the park is so badly labeled that you can't find anything and it gets really frustrating to the point of absolute annoyance. The 3 minute boat ride involves a 30 minute walk round in circles trying to get to it with no confirmation you are going the right way!!! We lost a lot of time at Xcaret and would now need to go back next time in Mexico. A stressful place to visit for us. Shell-Ha is a snorkelling park. The day we visited it was very windy and I would advise not going doing this on a windy day because I got sea sick trying to snorkel. The floating bridge was a real challenge to cross in the wind, being buffeted by the sea. Great fun. It is cheaper than Xcaret but the food in both the bufet and the next door burger / hot dog bar was revolting. All the tables seemed to leave their food. Maybe we chose the wrong buffet? We did the dolphin and sea life interaction experience at Puerto Adventura. This involved swimming with Manitee and intercating with a sea lion, finally swimming with dolphin. It was 179USD through our rep. The staff at the place seemed a little disorganised and telling us we would do one thing and taking us off to do another. Culimnating in telling us we had missed our bus (supplied by them) until we showed them in writing that we had been hanging around because they had written the wrong time down. I was a little disappointed as the time with the dolphins was so brief and the the 'free time' with the dolplhins they promised never materialised. The manitee experience was excellent. Again however we were told 20 minutes free time which turned into about 5 - 10 minutes. Regrettably, the whole experience appeared designed to allow them to create a couple of videos totalling 60USD approx which inevitably you purchased. The priority for them seemed to be their video! I don't know if it is better elswehere but I wanted more time with the dolphins for my money. Despite these points I would recommend a holiday to Mexico and at the under \u00a31000 for a forthnight I would highly recommend the all inclusive Riu Tequila.

We booked our vacation through Apple Vacations and flew with 3 other family members from Detroit Michigan. When we arrive at the hotel it was amazing. We were greeted with cold fruity drinks and immediately given our rooms. Our rooms were further back from the pool; however we liked this because it was quiet later at night. (The whole resort was on the quieter side. There was no loud music at night and people hollering because they had one too many.) Our rooms seamed a little outdated but other than that there is not one thing I can complain about. The pool is huge, very clean, a little cold but a refreshing dip when you just can't take the heat anymore. There always seamed to be loungers available and there was a swim up or walk up bar for those looking for refreshments. (Mmmm Corona) The beach is a short walk, maybe 6 or 7 minutes, but a walk worth taking. The trellises on the pathway covered in vines and greenery, and iguanas crossing your path made for a interesting 6 or 7 minute walk, that\u2019s for sure. (By the way, you can wait for 5 or so minutes and take the shuttle down, but then how will you ever work off the extra pounds you put on because the buffet was just that good.) Ok speaking of buffet, oh my, I don't even know where to start, 10 kinds of ice-cream, not 3, 10. Been to Cuba, never had bacon in the morning, the Tequila had trays and trays of it.

We are 25 and this was our first trip to an all-inclusive, and my first time in Mexico. Most of my travel experience has been in hostels or B&Bs in Europe, or chain hotels throughout the US, so my expectations aren't very high. The weather was great for anyone who is wondering - the first day was \"cool\" with a high of probably 75, and a couple days had some clouds but mostly it was probably 85 and sunny. Not a drop of rain that I saw or any evidence of it raining at night. We loved the Tequila, and would recommend it to anyone. It isn't totally perfect, obviously, but the good definitely outweighs the bad. Check in and Check out was smooth - we booked through the hotel, so we picked up our Hotel Beds transfer at the airport, which went fine. They drop off at a couple other hotels first. Once we got to the resort, we got our welcome drinks, and paid for our room. The rate they quoted was the rate we got. The one gripe I have about booking through the website was the transfer service - getting to the Tequila was fine, but we had some issues with the attitude of the representative on site. I had emailed our flight information (incoming and outgoing) well before we got there, and was told on Thursday before we left on Saturday that we wouldn't have a transfer because we hadn't given them our flight info yet - when we did talk to her the first day there she said we could get her our specific flight info \"anytime\" - so just set it up right away to ensure you don't have this problem! Upon complaining a bit we did get our transfer back to the airport. The van broke down though, so we had to meet another van and shove in with the others in there... but we all still got there in plenty of time to sit in the crowded Cancun airport for several hours. Back to the resort - the grounds are beautiful and well kept. The rooms were fine - not super luxurious, but seemed clean enough to me. Again, I do not have high expectations, so a more picky person might have thought it wasn't clean enough. The beds are hard and the pillows are crappy - we brought our own. We also brought an air freshener to get the musty smell to go away. The balcony was nice. We were in room 3220 which faced the street - sort of loud with car noises, but not terribly bad at all, and we barely heard any other people besides our immediate neighbors going in and out - so all in all a quiet location, but a very long walk from everything. The pool at the Tequila was great - it seemed pretty low key but there were some activities going on if you wanted to join in. The pool at the Yucatan was much busier, and I found their animation crew a little more pushy but not too bad. I got up early every day to get a good seat facing the ocean - I was there by 7:45 am and usually got the last 2 chairs together in the group of 20 or so that face the ocean. It didn't seem like this problem existed at the Tequila, but when I went there I didn't really care where we sat. The beach at the Yucatan was beautiful and large. Very crowded, because 2 huge resorts are using it, but it was great. I'm sure it was larger before, but it is still big. Chairs filled up by about 10:30am on the beach. We rented boogie boards and a kayak which were both fun. All the bars we went to at both resorts were great, good service and drinks were made how you asked for them. The swim up bar at the Yucatan was definitely more packed than the one at the Tequila. The food was good, we ate at the steak house once which was very nice. The food tasted good to me, and my husband's steak was cooked \"medium\" as he requested. We got reservations by 7:45am but could only get the 9pm seating. We had reservations for the Mexican restaurant but decided not to go because we got hungry before 9pm. The buffet was always good - not particularly awesome, but good. I really liked the lunch buffet, and I liked the one at the Tequila better than the Yucatan because it was less crowded. The entertainment was fine - not really my style, but oh well. Some people seemed to enjoy it. We only saw one \"show\" and it was pretty lame. I enjoyed watching the kids much more than the actual show. Sitting outside with some drinks at night was nice though. I would definitely recommend going into town at night instead of the entertainment at the resort. The great thing about this resort is it's proximity to town - we walked in to town twice, and took a cab once, only $5. The walk was about 30-40 minutes. I wouldn't recommend walking to and from and around town unless you have good shoes on though, I really hurt my foot by doing that. It was nice to get back from the hustle and bustle of the town to the relatively quiet area of Playacar. We did one tour, Tulum and Beyond, through playa.info - it was AWESOME. Definitely something to check out. When we were there, the crowd at the resort seemed to be a very good mix - lots of Canadians, Europeans, and Americans. Many young couples and groups, families with teens and small children, and older couples. It isn't a quiet resort, but didn't seem quite as rowdy as the Yucatan, but maybe that was just the vibe when we were there. I wouldn't call this a romantic resort by any stretch, but it is fun and everyone seemed nice and pretty laid back. Overall, we had an awesome time and I would definitely recommend this resort!", "Date": "February 25, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver", "Title": "\u201cGreat 2 Weeks!\u201d", "Author": "TwoCool", "ReviewID": "UR6820151", "Content": "Cal and Darlene Vancouver BC Canada Stayed Feb. 03rd to 17th When my husband Calvin booked our trip I was concerned about how far we were from the beach and wondered about requesting a change to either the Playacar or the Yukatan. I'm so glad I never made that request. In our 2 week stay we went to the other 2 hotels pools, lobby areas, buffets and the Playacar beach as these are offered as part of the package. Each time I was glad to be a guest at the Tequila. I liked the facilities better and loved the staff. The buffet is good at all of the 3 locations but I believe it was better at the Tequila. I even liked the dining room better. We've been to other all inclusive resorts in Mexico and found the large buffet and foods offered were better than any other we've been to. Neither of us had any food/stomach issues at all. I loved the walk to the beach and took the golf cart shuttle on occasion. A quick note about the Playacar beach, it was washing away during our stay. They had to sand bag it. The Yukatan beach is way better and is the beach at the end of the beach walk from the Tequila hotel. All shows at these resorts are cheesy but as I got to know the Animacion staff and saw how hard they worked from morning until night I was so impressed by them and their talents. Many of the dancers told us how much they liked their boss and loved working for him. They all seemed to really enjoy their jobs and each other and it really showed. The whole facility is kept incredibly clean and manicured. The rooms didn't have a speck of dirt but the furnishings are a bit outdated. No musty smell in our room but I did get many mosquito bites at night. We finally figured out that the mosquitos hung out in the hallway alcoves and got in when you opened the door or when housekeeping left the door open while they cleaned. I strongly recommend some kind of bug spray for this. There was rain on all but about 4 days of our visit. Some times for 10 minutes and a couple days it rained for a few hours. We brought an umbrella but the hotel also offers them to their guests. I would recommend insuring you have one in your room as once it rains it becomes more difficult to get one. There were a lot of kids participating in the kids club and it appeared they were having a great time. I loved that they learned spanish, participated in some of the evening shows, held iguanas and large parrots and received certificates at the beginning of the nightly shows. Every single staff person we came across was wonderful. Even the gardeners said hello when you passed by them. We met some wonderful people from all over the world. There were guests from Canada, USA, Poland, Belgium, Germany and many from England. A quick hello to Lorraine and Dave from England. We enjoyed the few evenings spent with you both and the wonderful conversations we all had. I have only one complaint about this resort, they could use another one or two a la carte restaurants for those of us that stay for 2 weeks. I didn't find the Mexican restaurant that great so it left the buffet and the steak house as our only choices. Hope this helps you with your vacation selection. I had a fantastic time and believe we each make a vacation what we want of it. This resort will help you have the vacation you are hoping for as it has something for everyone.

My partner and i had a really great time, i had previously visited the hotel with my family in 2004, and would go again! This hotel is just fantastic, i really do not understand people leaving negative reviews-there are a small points to pick at, but nothing that would ruin your stay. I hope you find the following information useful: Weather: We had 2 weeks of good weather, a few days were overcast, but there wasnt one day without any sunshine. The sun tends to go down around 4ish compared to say 6ish in the august months. It can be a little chilly in the evenings as it is not as humid in feb, would advise taking a few cardigans etc. Overall the weather was good. On a nice day was around 30degrees. Beach: We used the beach in front of the Riu Yucatan, as the beach by the playacar has unfortunately been badly damaged from the hurracaines, they are trying to re build it and im sure it will eventually even out. As the beach by the yucatan is better, it is very very busy and a little cramp. However, beautiful white sands and the sea is crystal blue- had great fun when the waves were high! Food: ABSOLUTELY FIRST CLASS!!!!!! The food was really great, breakfast and dinner in the main restaurant is a buffet, lots of variety. At lunch time you can eat at the pool bar which again is a buffet, very good. There are 2 a la cartes, the steak house and the mexican which is on the beach. didnt try the mexican but the steak house was vert good. Staff: Faultless. Vert friendly- always going out of their way to help you, happy, polite people. Joel at the kids club was great- is soo good at his job. Lots of activities going on during the day. The evening entertainment was also very good. The main show starts at 09:45, they were fantastic- shows such as Michael Jackson, Moulin Rouge, Crazy Show, all good to watch. Pool is nice, lots of sun loungers, swim up bar, buffet etc. The hotel grounds are very nice, scenic and very well looked after. Rooms were ok, nothing fancy, but hey, you only sleep in there!

Being this our first time to Mexico with small children I was a bit worried and read every review about the hotel before going. I must tell you that we had a wonderful experience! From the food, staff, entertainment, pools, and activities for the children ...everything was very awesome. Silvana at the front desk always greeted us with a smile and was more than happy to answer any of our questions. Joel the co-ordinator was amazing with the children! Always something for them to do he showed such passion for his job and it showed as all the children just loved this young man. Geovani and Nicolas always made our dining experience a joy. Always making sure we had everything we needed. I have a loss for words for the food. There are not enough words to tell you how hard these people work and go out of there way to satisfy you. The food was delicious and always a huge variety to choose from for breakfast, lunch and dinner. The hotel was very nice, and super clean. We had beautiful weather. The beach was just across the street and if you didn't want to walk they had a golf cart that would bring you there. We felt very safe in the area and often left our resort. We ventured off to Wal-Mart, Playacar (shopping centre to the left of Riu Tequila), and down to Fifth Avenue which is there flea market. My daughter had her hair braided (whole head) for $25 then they got me with an extra $10 for the flowers. The people there practically beg you to come in their stores. Personally had I'd know I would have boughten all my souveniers at Wal-Mart. Before you enter a taxi ask your driver how much he's going to charge you before you get in, we never paid more that $5 US. Thankfully my children never got sick and actually ate very well the whole week. The mini-disco was a blast for the kids. At the end of the week they actually had the children perform. The nightly shows were so great we enjoyed them tremendously. I wish I had know that the hotel offered strollers for little ones (upon availability) as my daughter wanted to be carried all the time. Drinks were great with a huge variety to choose from. Helpful hints would be to bring mosquito repellent, aloe gel for sunburns, and nothing but comfortable shoes.

When we arrived we were disappointed because we booked our trip in August of 2006 and our travel agent requested that our rooms be located by the pool. They gave us rooms that were located furthest away from the pool. We expressed our disappointment to the Resort Management and they sent each couple a gift with a note stating that they were sorry that our rooms were not located as we thought and they would move all 3 couples the following day to rooms that were near the pool. The next morning they advised us to pack up our luggage and they moved everything to rooms that were located right next to the pool. The staff was very friendly, the rooms were extremely clean and the food was out of this world. The pressure in the shower is great, just about knocks you over when you turn it on!!! The sports and entertainment staff (James and Richy) get the \"thumbs up\" The evening shows were excellent and they constantly strived for audience participation. During the day time hours the staff was always pool side encouraging the guests to get involved in the numerous activities. The only thing that I would rate the Riu Resorts poorly on is their choice of beds for the rooms. We stayed at the Riu Cancun last year and all the Riu's seem to have extremely hard beds. I did request a piece of memory foam for my bed which they did provide me with which helped quite a bit. We would definitely visit the Riu Tequila again and for that matter any other Riu.

Beautiful resort Date 23rd jan-06feb07 Well where do i start,just came back after a fortnights holiday with my husband.on arrival we were met by our tomson reps who guided us to our coaches to the hotel,it takes around 45-50 minutes to the hotel from cancun airport.This was our first time in mexico.On arrival we were met by a cool refreashing drink and given our enveolpe which contained our room keys,safe keys,and beach towel cards!once in our room we were called by the reception staff to see if everything was okay,which it was , our suitcases where delivered to our room around 15 minutes later.we had a 2nd floor room,near the pool area,the room had two double beds,seperate shower and toilet,plenty of clean towels,tv,hairdryer,fan, a/c ,minibar,which had alcohol and soft drinks,a small balcony with chairs.Room was clean,also you get room service everyday ,if you want clean towels you put them in the shower cubicle and they replace them for you.we didnt realise that till i read the leaflet card near the basin sink!!Also they change your bedding,bins etc,we were very happy with the service!!We didnt find the beds that hard,or the rooms musty at all.food was great,plenty of choices,we are vegeterians although we eat fish,the buffets were the best.we didnt bother trying the steakhouse or mexican restaurants.plenty of drinks,you wont be dissappointed at all.weather was good also although we had rain after a few days for about a hour or so,and also the day we left it really poured down,it was still very humid though.The tomson reps excursion prices are pretty dear so we decided to book some excursions from 5th avenue,who were cheap compared to tomsons,also we got small vans that seat about 10-12 people pick us up,rather than the tomson coaches who go and pick other lots of people from their hotels and drop them off later.the less people their is the less time spent picking and dropping them off!we went to chichen itza,quad biking,xcaret,and to cozumel to do some shopping.Their is a small mexican street 5 mins to your left right outside the hotel although it is a lot dearer than you would get in 5th avenue.5th avenue is only $5 dollars in the taxi and 5-8 minutes away from the hotel.i bought a mexico football shirt for my brother and they wanted 45 dollars for it,in 5th avenue i got it for only 20 dollars!!!!you have to haggle cause they know you are tourists who want to pick up gifts etc,they will double the price before they bring it down,some people just gave them what they asked for,maybe thats why they ask such a high price.xcaret was good the show was spectacular,worth seeing,we got a taxi $12 dollars from the hotel,takes around 15 mins.$59 to see the animals and show or $89 that also includes snorkelling gear and buffet lunch,which is worth it really.we cant swim so missed out on the snorkelling.the people are really friendly where ever you go.cozumel is about a 30-40 ferry ride away from playa del carmen.it has all the usual shops and snorkelling,fishing,etc.we went to do some retail therapy and a bit of lunch.mexico is quite a expensive place.they take the $ or mexican pesos.we took $ with us since it was a better rate.i would defo recommend this hotel at least once,i would love to go back but me and my husband like to try differant hotels,my brother is planning to go here after hearing us raving about it.i can guarantee you will have a blast of a time!!we had no problems regarding any sort of things,although i would recommend you take some mosquito repellant with you,we had a few bites in the reception lounge area in the evenings and some in the room..entertainment was good,although we didnt see the shows every day.we met a few couples from england,nice people,mostly canadians in the resort compared to the europeans.the resort itself is very clean and massive.one last thing ditch the diet before you go cause you wont be able to help urself.have a great holiday,im jealous

Cleaning staff constantly going through our belongings use the safe and lock you suitcases\u2026 2) Wait Staff , I do not think we were the only people that got bad rush cafeteria service at the hotel food troughs , you must always leave someone sitting at the table to guard your food or the waiters will clean off your table and give it to another person, this happened twice to us during our stay, we complained to the waiters captain about throwing out average tasting food and being wasteful, he pointed us to another table where we ignored by waiters, needless to say we did not leave any tips\u2026 3) Food is recycled daily and make sure to try the steak house restaurant for over cooked shoe leather steaks yum yum, by the way steak house is the same building that is used to eat lunch, wear your speedo with no shirt, shoes and smell like sh*t to look like the other clowns that eat there, no dress code anywhere?.... 4) Eroded Beach or what\u2019s left of it is a half mile away nice walk or tram service and remember you cannot use any of services offered by the two Riu Palace Hotels which is too bad . Be prepared for a wind storm on the beach on a daily bases\u2026\u2026..We are seasoned Mexico travelers and would not return to this hotel and area again.

Overall, give the very reasonable price, this is a good choice for a family on a budget.", "Date": "February 1, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Southampton, New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cObjective review with pictures ...\u201d", "Author": "Cancun_Bill", "ReviewID": "UR6719325", "Content": "... and a link to many more pictures on our homepage at the end of the review. We have stayed at many all inclusive resorts in Mexico, the Dominican Republic. This was our first stay with Riu and this review compares the Riu Tequila to Iberostar and Barcelo, as we have stayed at both of these hotel chains properties in the Riviera Maya. Grounds and location: Beautiful, as you can see from the pictures. I prefer the Tequila property over the Riu Yucatan, even thought the Yucatan is on the beach, it doesn't have the nice gardens like the Tequila. I liked the smaller spread out cottage type buildings better than the apartment style hotels. This area is a good part of the Riviera Maya because it's close to Playa Del Carmen ($5 taxi ride, rent a bike or walk) and it breaks up the monotony of being at the resort for 7 days. We didn't do any excursions having been to this region before, but it's ideally located to see the ruins, SCUBA dive or a side trip to Cozumel. Room: Our room was clean and comfortable. The beds are hard as others have said. We asked for mattress pads and they delivered. Our mini bar was stocked almost every day. (But we tipped) And that didn't hurt in the towel art department either. That was amazing, and amusing. Food and drinks: Better than Barcelo, as good as Iberostar, but not quite as varied. The buffets were fabulous and we always found plenty to eat. The mixed drinks were good and the wait for a drink was short. The beer brand at Riu is Corona. (Iberostar and Barcelo are Dos Equis) The only ala carte we did was the Mexicano at the Yucatan. The food was good but the big attraction there would be the view of the ocean. This time of the year it was dark for dinner, but during the day this restaurant is a lunch buffet which you can use while at the Riu Yucatan's beach or pool. The view of the ocean is stunning from here. Pools and Beach: The pools are big and clean and they were pretty warm for January. The beach was a longer walk than some of the reviews I've read would lead you to believe. There is a shuttle but it was always going the opposite direction and it only seats 8 people anyway. Plan on walking. Or waiting for it. There were enough loungers on the beach but they were close together. This stretch of beach was crowded, but we were there following a windy spell. While there was no significant erosion in front of the Yucatan, there was some erosion in front of the Riu Palace next door and this may have contributed to the crowding. There are no palapas on the beach at this resort, but there are lots of palm trees for shade. Service and other things: Very fast check-in and they accommodated our only request which was for an upper floor. Staff was friendly and attentive. They had plenty of high speed Internet stations. (important to me) Overall: We chose the Tequila because it's a 4 star resort that most visitors rate as 5 stars. I would rate it even a little better than 4 star for it's value. TripAdvisor only allows 10 pictures per review. There are many more pictures of this resort and those I compare it to in the photo gallery on our homepage http://www.bill-and-val.com/riu_tequila.htm Hope this helps!!", "Date": "January 31, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Virginia", "Title": "\u201cPretty good place to vacation\u201d", "Author": "VirginiaSbtraveler", "ReviewID": "UR6719251", "Content": "My wife and I and another couple spent New Years at the Riu Tequila (Dec 28-Jan 4, 2007) and all in all found the resort to be very nice. Even better is the town of Playa del Carmen - it's like a street festival every night (well, at least over the holidays!) and is very safe. We loved the Riu Tequila food - and we are all food snobs. While it's not 4-star dining, I was impressed how they could have so many choices - all of good quality for so many people. The rooms were great, not spectacular - but good enough considering you don't spend a lot of time in the room. The beds are hard, but apparently that's the way they are in most of the resorts down there. I saw a posting where someone said they went out and purchased egg-cushions for their beds which is an excellent idea. The only downside to the Riu Tequila is that it's off the beach, meaning you have to walk for about 5-8min to get to the beach. Additionally, you share the beach with all the other guests at another Riu - so finding a beach chair for two, or worse yet - 4, is nearly impossible after 930am. I liked the area of Playa del Carmen so much that we are going back next year for a family trip. I'm a beach guy, so I scoped out the Sandos Playacar while there and found they have the best beach area.

We have been to Mexico 6 times since 1995 and have previously stayed at one other all-inclusive, the Bahia Principe - Tulum. This hotel is clean, the staff is friendly, the food is good. It is an excellent value for the money. The Bahia was a little fancier, but I'm not sure the price difference was equal to the extras. We did not realize the tap water was not potable until we arrived. They do provide bottle water, make sure you use it to brush your teeth. Weather was hot (mid to upper 80s F) and sunny. We've been before in January before and its been in the 70s. Thats too cold for me. It rained one day in the morning, but was clear and sunny by afternoon. (They break out the gambling tables and other entertainment to keep everyone happy while it rains!) We were traveling with 2 adults and 2 children (ages 7 and 8). We requested a quiet room and could not have been more satisfied. We were in room 1411 (second floor), our balcony overlooked lush tropical landscape. When you open your sliding door, the coati come scrambling out of the trees begging for food. They are very cute, but we did refrain from feeding them as they are wild. There were no other buildings behind us. If the wind shifted, you could sometimes hear RIU Lupita, but only while on the balcony. The hallway to the rooms is like an echo chamber. ANY noise in the hall is clearly heard in your room (even slapping flip flops are quite loud!). However, we could hear no noise between the rooms. We join everyone else in the complaint of hard beds. I like a firm bed, but these beds are about equal to sleeping on the floor. The standard room is decent size. We were able to fit a twin roll away, in addition to the two double beds. There is a drying rack on the balcony and plenty of hangers in the closet. Water pressure in the shower is great with plenty of hot water. In fact, be careful if you turn both faucets on full force. It blew our shower head out of the holder and squirted water every where! Although we are American, we loved that the majority of the patrons seemed to be from other countries. Lots of Canadians. Our children loved mini club. Joel was the leader for our week and he was wonderful. Mini club runs from 10:30-12:30 and 3:00-4:30 every day. They play games (pool games, shuffle board, ping pong, bocci ball), do crafts, etc. Our kids met lots of wonderful friends. I agree with all the other reviewers that recommend eating at Tequila only. The Tequila facility is much cleaner. It is also much less crowded. Cruz makes great drinks at the pool bar. We walked to the beach every day. It is a nice stroll down a shaded path. We only took the shuttle back once to amuse the kids. We were surprised at how rough the ocean was. I expected it to be calmer with Cozumel just off the coast. One day, however, it was absolutely still - like bath water. We thought this resort was very family friendly. There were plenty of singles and a large wedding party, everyone was very considerate. The staff went out of their way to be friendly to the kids. We are not smokers and therefore loved that the pool bar was non-smoking. Also, there are many tables in all the restaurants (even Lupita, which is open air) that are non-smoking. No excursions for us this trip.

Check-in: Very quick. Throught our stay, the check-in staff were very helpful in answering all of our questions. Rooms: Our room was on the second floor, and offered a private view of the palm trees nearby. All rooms have a outdoor, covered balcony. The rooms were very clean and comfortable for 2 people. The beds were very firm...I liked it that way. Pillows were too small. Bring your own if you have a favorite. Each room has a minibar and liquor dispenser. You can't drink the tap water but the minibar is always stocked with bottled water. Food: Absolutely the best food I have ever experienced in a resort...no exceptions. Variety was far reaching and will please a great many tastes. Everything was fresh. The people working in the restaurants are all aimed at making the guest experience the best it can be. They grilled some fresh Triggerfish for us that we caught in the ocean. Lunches were great in the Lupita restaurant. Good hamburgersas, salads, fresh guacamole, pasta chef. I was suprised by the lack of spicy food...I had to look harder than I expected for spicy salsa. Beach: The beach is acessed through either the walkway directly across from the Riu Tequila or by walking through the Riu Yucatan. About one quarter mile. This beach has plenty of lounge chairs for everybody. Nice sandy beach for walking. We walked south past the last resort and back. Then walked toward Playa. Overall Experience: The staff at the Riu Tequila really went out of their way to ensure all the guests got the most of their vacations.

This was our first time long haul was not sure what to expect but this hotel,staff and location all out of this world desperate to go back!! 1. Hotel- - first class all the way everytime we looked we noticed something else absolutely beautiful. Our room was located in the best possible place right opposite the pool area, near to reception and not noisy at all. If going ask for block 3. Being the festive season was not sure what to expect and I don't particularly like Christmas trust me I was converted!! Everything was spot on a gorgeous decorated tree, lights all round the palm trees nothing was left it was amazing. Staff lovely and friendly and polite and very very helpful Thomson Reps pretty good too but hotel staff much better on the whole. 2. Food - big worry for me we are vegetarian and I am allergic to spicy food trust me NOT A PROBLEM the food was out of this world loads of choices from salad's to fish to meat to dessert you will not starve there really is something for everyone. The waiter's again brilliant take time to get to know them we saw Rangel a sweet 16 year old but he was a lovely kid looked after as well as did Heirmoin and without expecting anything I did tip them but that was personal choice because we did receive excellent service. Christmas Eve and New Year's Eve words cannot describe the food or the atmostphere very special. 3. Animation Team - - I have no words that can explain just how hardworking and nice they all were we got to know them very well and we were all crying when we had to say goodbye. The whole team are the nicest people I have ever met in many many years and the shows Spectactular and not repeated in 3 weeks we were there. Grease on New's Year Eve unforgettable, Michael Jackson not convinced it was'nt him!!! tho Ricardo does a fab inpression of him to!! I cannot say any show was not worth seeing as they were all as I have said before BRILLIANT!!! Join in and have fun it really is worth it and I am quite shy. Plenty of Activites both day and night and you are not pressured into anything. Animation Team we Miss you all!!!!!! 4. Trips - We booked through our rep as1st time away you could do trips yourself just pop down to stalls at Playacar or just get a taxi from reception. Anyway trips -- Pirate Boat Show-- The funniest thing we have ever seen in along time we were entertained from the moment we got off the coach til we got back on again a must for all ages. The food was great to there was Lobster,Steak, Jacket Potato and lots of salad and cake for dessert. Really good night out. Xcaret - Awesome the park is massive you really would need 2 days to do everything. We went on the Sea Trek and I do not swim!! but it was worth it the fish swim by you as do turtles and the diver's make sure you are okay especially if nervous like me!! Do NOT miss the show this is one thing I would highly recommend stay and see it you will not be disappointed. If you are a water person you will love it here and if you are not there is loads to see and do a park suited to everyone! Swim with Dolphins - We went to Dolphin Discovery at Isla Marjaras we got the boat over and the crew are totally crazy could have stayed with them all day!! Anyway DD is really nice lovely and clean and the DOLPHINS beautiful my daughters did the Royal Swim and had a fab time I did the platform 'swim' where I stood on the plaform waist deep and got a kiss and cuddle and dance and it was worth it. Tip take cash with you as they take alot of photos and Dvd's but you are not under any obligation to buy them. We also cycled to the Turtle farm it was nice but I was a bit disappointed as I expect to be there longer and expected a bit more but it was nice to be there. Boat trip back brilliant lots of singing and dancing really great end to a great day. Lastly we walked to Playa da Carmen one day and came across a bird sanctuary just about 10 mins walk from the hotel we found it by chance an what a hidden gem why this is not mentioned as places to go I do not know however it was wonderful the birds in natural habitat not caged was refreshing to see we were there was about 2 hours, and never really saw anyone it was like being in our own piece of paradise. Well worth a visit. 5. Beach -- Few minutes away lovely walkway the beach stunning loads of sunbeds and again animation team doing activites if you wanted to. Minus Yucantan for lunch do'nt bother it was not nice and the toilets awful go back to the tequila for lunch that is all I will say. 6. Playacar - nice little arcade of shops especially nice at night prices not to bad cheaper than the hotel by a mile. 7. Chichen Iitza --- Magical, Spiritual, Awesome, Historical! That is all I will say one on the best place's in the world and after being there I totally understand. If there is only one trip you should not miss then this is it. That is why I have left the review on this to the last Go there it really should not missed all ages can go and it is well worth the few hours on the coach. Go and see for your selves. And Lastly friends. We were very lucky to meet some really great people who we will stay in contact with. Especially Josette, Jimmy and boys, Debbie and her lovely family who looked after me New Year's Eve, Tracey from Canada sorry did'nt get to say goodbye but so please we met you and your family. Many more - hello to all - but a very special thank you to a lovely friendly couple Kevin and Inge short and sweet (the time spent with you!!) not your appearance!!! met at Senor Frogs great couple makes you realise there really is good people out there.

I agree with most comments posted on this web-site so I'll try and avoid being redudant and offer some different points and feedback I read less frequently: 1) Mosquitos galore. We all got bit up at night especially our three year old daughter which took a beating on her poor face and shoulders. I would recommend a fly swatter or insect repellent. 2) Food is much better we found at the Tequila versus the Yucatan and Playacar. Don't go out of your way to try either unless it's convient for you to do so as you're not missing anything. 3) The week we were at the RIU Tequila the beach shuttle was broken so we had to walk. This is nice walk for adults, but not so much for three kids, beach towels, toys, bags, snacks, strollers, etc. This did become a mild hassle by week's end. If you plan to spend a ton of time on the beach with your youngsters, it might be worth staying at the other RIU resorts on the beach. 4) It's windy in Playa del Carmen in January we've noticed having been there three times the past five years. I'm not a weather expert, but it does seem to rain and/or be more partly to mostly cloudy versus others months i.e. March and April we've been in Mexico. Might be worth looking into if you're planning a short trip in January. 5) The beach is disappearing rapidly into the ocean. It was acutally worse than when we were on the Yucatan Peninsula in 2005. We found the beaches felt cramped along the Playacar resorts. However, we found more space to roam on the beach in Playa del Carmen. 6) We were impressed how family friendly the RIU Tequila was as we shared the resort with dozens of families with small children. My wife and I found it odd this demographic and the \"party\" people could co-exisist in the same space, but it seemed to work (Outside of the usual drunken Americans ignoring the fact children were watching and listening closely as they removed articles of clothing that didn't need to be removed and creative use of the f-word.) 6) Playa del Carmen felt different to my wife and I this year - more commercial/American/chain store i.e. Walmart, Burger King, McDonalds, Subway, Starbucks, etc. It still has a nice charm with the cobble stone streets and friendly street vendors, but I used to love the old Mexico feel with a touch of European influence. 7) Xcaret is worth the money. I was skeptical being sensitive to costs and giving up a day of our family vacation to really experience the park. However, it was time well spent especially the snorkeling, evening show, watching the dolphins, and butterfly exhibit. 8) The entire staff (front desk , bar tenders, wait staff, maids, etc) work very hard to accomodate your needs and make your stay first-class and enjoyable. Reward them with a $1 here and there and it does go a long way. It was not lost on my wife and I the hours and effort they put in.

I had requested this a month prior. The drink and food was good. They even had lobster tails cut into 2 inch pieces. Pretty good! Mexican and Steak a la cartes were excellent. Make sure you are there early in the morning to book your restaurant, say 7:00am as there are only 30 spots available for that restaurant. I'm not joking!!. It was my friend's birthday and I booked the Steak restaurant and told them it was her birthday. That day when we got back from the beach, her room was decorated with balloons and at the restaurant, they had our table decorated as well. It really made a huge impact on our opinion of this resort. They really do try and please you. The beaches were beautiful, and I must say we had the best beach. The other beaches were pretty much washed up. We had sun and clouds all week with one day of rain, so I am pretty happy with that. It was extremely windy most of these days, but it was welcomed on the beach as it can get pretty hot. Now the negatives, the beds and pillows were hard so it was hard to snuggle in at night. The food was a bit repetitive but still good. There's something there for everyone.

My boyfriend and I went on our first romantic get away! It was perfect. This hotel was amazing along with the excurtions, food, beach and entertainment! This place is good for young/older singles, young/older couples and children. They accomodate everyone to their needs, if you need anything or want anything, just ask them. All you can eat and drink at every hour of the day, entertainment is excellent and the employees treat you like your on a well deserved vacation or a break from reality! This resort is the party place from 11pm-2am if you still have enough energy from the day! Even though the beach is 800m away...big deal. On an extreme windy day the beach is not the place to go, at this resort it can be extremely windy, but you can still play volleyball, ping pong or lye at the pool. Its enclosed with plenty of sunshine and loungers, which of course you have to get early or their gone fast unfortunately, but the same form the beach. We spent most of our beach time at the Yucatan. This is also a great hotel for food and entertainment. We played beach volleyball everyday, lots of cerveza's and of course siesta's! The only problem that I had was its kind stinks by the beach club where they have their mexican el carte dinners, probably because of the bathrooms there, not very present! The pretty much have the same day and night enetertainment every hour for each resort though. There is a lot of shoppping around our resorts, at the playacar plaza and 5th Avenue in Playa del Carmen. I found everything pretty expensive. Even the Walmart! Everything is is walking distance or $5 US for a nombre (taxi). We went on 3 excurtions. The F1 off shore explorer was pretty expensive and somewhat pointless. Flying across the ocean at 500 horse power was then best part. They take you to 3 other locations, 2 of them you just sit around and 1 is the snorkeling, which you get to see some sea turtles, then have a lunch after. That's it 1/2 day for $123 US. The other was Xelha, which is a natural aquarium, like a water park. Its absolutely amazing. We did this with a Tulum tour, but you definately need a full day at the water park, cross your fingers for a nice day though!! Tulum was good too, only if you like to learn about the history of it. I unfortunately have trouble with listening to accents, so I didn't get all the infro from the tour guide, but in the end he was awesome, extremely hillarious and sarcatistic!!! We book on selloffvacations.com and went through sunquest. The Caribe Sunquest tour guide was awesome! I cannot remember his name, but its sound like Jesus (he'll tell you that too). The only unfortunate part is that is goes by extremely fast, so cherish every minute of it, I know I did!! Our flight was a direct flight from Calgary to Cancun through skyservice, which is not a good flight service at all! Yes, they do serve half decent meals and play movies, but the fact that your only allowed 50kg for 2 people including their luggage and carry ons is rediculas. We were ok going there, but in Cancun we had to pay $100 US because we were 10kg over, that's because they weighed our carryons...who does that?? I guess we good the least amount of stress, there was a lot of pissed off people on the flight that day. There were people who had to pay $400. That's ridiculas. So be careful what you pack, even if your going for 2 weeks like we did. Another thing was the beds at the Tequila. I'm not sure if its every Riu, but it look like it in their Riu brochure. The bed are 2 double beds pushed together and hard as a rock...not very romantic.

Spacious wardrobes included about 12 coat hangers and safe. (No extra charge for safe.) There is plenty of drawer space. The satelite tv picks up quite a few english speaking programmes and films. The hairdryer had two speeds. The shower is a walk in type. There was also a well stocked fridge and mini-bar with 4 optics. Again no extra charge! Air conditioning and ceiling fan worked well. The gardens and pool were extremely well maintained. Sunbeds were plentiful and again well maintained. Clean towels supplied for the pool and beach upon presentation of your towel card. The shuttle service to the beach was very frequent but do be aware it does not run between 12 noon and 3.00 pm so if you are on the beach and do not want to eat at the Yucatan you must walk back - it will take only 5 mins at gentle stroll pace. The beach was superb but you do need to be early for the sunbeds, which are inclusive. The food was superb - lots of choice, including vegetarian options.

Bars were well stocked and staffed by friendly knowledgable bar people. You must try the cocktails; our favourite was Blue Ocean & Dr. Funk. Trips were available but be aware - the Platinum cruise does not really live up to its name. A coach picks you up at 7.00 (acccording to the time sheet) but in reallity it was 7.30 am. About an hour 1/4 later you arrive in Cancun and board a very fast boat to the island. The swim and encounter with the dolphins was great but you can do all this closer to home if you choose the cheaper dolphin discovery trip. You will be back mid afternoon as opposed to 7.00pm. on the \"cruise\". The only negative thing we can say is that the corridors are very echoie and noisy neghbours could cause you problems. Hotel rules asks for silence in the corridors after 11.00 pm and most people respect this. All in all a fantastic holiday and we will definnitely be going back. Next time for two weeks it is not possible to experience all that the area has to offer in less time.", "Date": "January 3, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Belgium", "Title": "\u201cWe loved it\u201d", "Author": "ukfemme", "ReviewID": "UR6545983", "Content": "My husband and I stayed at the hotel from 16th December for two weeks. Right from entering the hotel we knew that we would love it. Check in was fast and they had even a meal to offer us at 12,00 in the evening but the only thing after such a long flight we wanted was to go to bed and sleep which we did. The pool is fantastic and the sun loungers are always available, still people put towels on and saved places even though all over there are signs saying they are not allowed to. `So if you go and it's saved just take off the towel. People did that and didn't appear for half of the day it's disgusting. The food was the tops in the main restaurant, we tried the Steak house as it was my Birthday whilst there and wanted to it to be served instead of self service. I must say it was not up to much and we didn't go back. My husband was dissapointed as he told them it was my birthday and nothing special happened. He told the reception and the next day our bedroom was decorated with balloon and paper. The team who do the dancing and the animation are a very hard working lot, good on them they are great and very talented. Although most of the shows were good there were a few that were a little boring mostly because they mimed to certain songs and it would be better if in fact they had proper singers for that part. On the whole we enjoyed them. The Beach was nice, sea was warm and no problem getting the chairs, we didn't bother getting the little buggy to the beach as the walk was alway refreshing and it was nice to see the little animals there. We both had a swedish massage which was really relaxing and is reccomended. I also had a special pedicure with was which was great. We went to Tulum by coach and didn't book the trip with anyone and it was a lot cheaper. Wasn't impressed mostly not in one piece and you were not able to go inside any of the buildings. Xscharet is a must but go with a taxi and save yourself lots of money. Swim with the Dolphins is expensive for the time you get to swim with them which works out to only around 7 mins per person. But the rest off the place is beautiful. Costumel isn't really worth seeing and the shops put on the prices as the cruise ships berth there. Cancun is worth the trip go on a coach from the station in town, it takes around 1 hr and then you get onto a bone shaker to take you either to the hotel district or the shopping centres. It costs around 34pesos each way which is nothing. The only thing about the hotel are the bedrooms, they could do with a bit of updating and still have the old fashioned room key. Yes the beds are hard but I like them that way and we never got back ache or anything. The maids are very good and the room was kept very clean. The towels made everyday of a different animal is really worth seeing and is very clever. They don't get paid a lot of money so if you tip them every now and then they really appreciate it. Taxi's are cheap and clean. I think that's all for now. We would go back and will in the future.

Never the less, when we arrived that didn\u2019t matter! The rooms are more than adequate. Fantastic if you will! Mini bar restocked every two days, although you can just ring reception and have it done at any time. You get 4 corona's 2 Pepsi\u2019s, 2 sprite, 2 Fizzy Orange, water, soda, tonic water. Also you have Tequila, Vodka, Gin and rum in the optics in your room. I am a whiskey drinker, when you enter your room reception call you when your settled and ask you if everything is ok, I said I wasn\u2019t to keen on the spirits. They asked what I liked; they sent up a bottle of Jim beam and left it in my room! Alcohol aside! When you arrive, you are asked to leave you baggage in reception and stick you room stickers on your cases from your welcome pack. You cases will be taken to your room within 40 minutes. So if there is anything you need, take it with you. A $1 tip is advised so don\u2019t do what I did, and take change the smallest I had was a $20 so Andres loved me!! A note of caution! Your room numbers are not so easy to locate on the map, my room number was 722 which mean it is in block 7 and if you are in room 322 your block is 3, it\u2019s that simple. But, when you have been on a plane for 11hrs and a bus for 1.5hrs, it\u2019s not simple!! When your bags arrive you have about 15 mins before you get \"the call\" When you have OK'd everything, I\u2019m sure you either want to sleep or have a drink! The first is simple enough! If you fancy a drink head to the bar. There are 3 bars, one is the sports bar which is exactly as you would imagine, an AMERICAN sports bar. There are two more bars, one outside the sports bar and one opposite the stage (you will know what I mean) I recommend the outdoor bar opposite the stage. Great staff! Same staff every night and they work TOO hard, it\u2019s insane! I recommend the Melon Sour with Vodka. Simply amazing. Corona is the beer you can have, and corona being my fav I will very happy until I had my first. The beer, no matter where you drink it will go flat and warm within 2 minutes (not nice). Every bar serves exactly the same drinks. No specialised bars. Even the pool bar. Food. I as the Italians say I Live to eat not eat to live. I was simply disappointed with the food. It was not bad, neither was there quantity, quality or verity problem on your first night. The only problem is....... it\u2019s the same basic sort of Mexican/Tourist food every day.... What a drag. Same thin beef steaks and I mean thin, same tasteless white fish. Same rice ECT, ECT, and ECT. So my advice is, if your like me and enjoy food for the pleasure of eating and not just the need, make sure you are up early enough to book the steak restaurant (but not every night, it would get just as boring) and eat out. Playa Del Carmen (a $5taxi ride) has countless places to eat and drink and it\u2019s reasonably priced. So experience \"the real\" Mexico (well as close as you can get without back packing!). Lunch it is exactly the same problem with the buffet dinner, same boring food every day. There is a night club. Pi\u00f1ata. If you like \"Fiddy\" cent you will love it. If your like the other 99.9% of us who simply think he should grow up and leave us all alone, Avoid it. Pi\u00f1ata opens at 12am and the music is ok for about 30 mins then the above described rubbish. The pool. There are 3 pools. 2 main, either side of the steak/lunch restaurant and a Childs pool with fake beach. Being neither a child or not having one I cannot say anything about that pool!! But the other two are great! There is a pool bar and although other reviews say it is always full, I didn\u2019t experience that. It certainly got busy, but never full. The are two sets of water beds and they are good especially if you want to tan, and there was always room. The pool's at there deepest were 1.3m so no diving which is ok considering you just want to relax anyway! Well if you only want to relax use the second pool as the first pool has goals at either end of the pool, a volley ball pitch, ping pong and may more activates all day and the staff try their hardest to get you involved if you at pool 1!! The beach is amazing although there is an 800m walk to the beach. I say although because some of you may find that too far! If so there is a complimentary buggy to take you there and bring you back. The beach is a typical Caribbean beach, white sands (although there not white and white sands never are unless you in the Maldives!) any way, white sands, warm see and plenty of wildlife. While at the tequila you can use the facilities from two of the neighbouring hotels, and the Riu Yucatan\u2019s beach bar is on the see front serving all day snacks (same stuff every day) and drink. I\u2019m not really sure what else to say apart from have a great time and make the most of your time, see chichen itza, its a must see. If I had to give an overall rating of the resort (taking into consideration the food) it would get a 70%, but I cannot do that. I know I am fussy about my food and do not the same thing or even the same style thing twice, and I completely understand that they have to cater for the majority and so it gets a 95%", "Date": "December 30, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Holanda", "Title": "\u201cWow loved it!\u201d", "Author": "Jessiejjj", "ReviewID": "UR6515241", "Content": "Wow!

My 2nd visit in a year, loved it again the 2nd time around. I decided to go back to the Tequila for my birthday, having spent it there the year before. I emailed them, saying I was coming alone for a few nights and would like a 2nd floor room close to the main building. Upon my arrival I was greeted with a fruity drink and told my room would be ready by 3 pm, so I changed my clothes and sat by the pool. Lo and behold, at 2:45 I was giving a 2nd floor room in building #2, the building right beside the main restaurant/lobby/bar/stage. I would recommend it except if you like mid afternoon siestas, you may want another building. At 4:30 the bingo starts and it was pretty loud. My first evening I received a hand written note delivered to my room from the PR person saying that she knew I was there alone and she was there to offer any advice or help. Then the mgr called me, welcoming me and asking if all was ok. It was like they couldn't do enough to welcome me, I was once again impressed. On my actual birthday, I received a fruit plate. If you're going for a special occasion, make sure you let them know. For my birthday dinner Leo, the buffer mgr, arranged to have balloons all over my table and tied to the chairs. He also gave champagne to the table. Then they gathered with a cake, sang me the mexican version of happy birthday. It was very nice. Food throughout my stay was very good, I do believe the Riu Tequila holds first prize for the world's best french toast. It also has the best guacamole I've ever tasted. I did not try the a la carte restaurants since I was only there for 4 nights, but I could see the buffet becoming a bit monotonous if you were to be there for 7 nights or more. The one complaint I have about the dining experience is the wine. For some reason, everything else is good but the wine is almost un-drinkable. I had a bottle I brought in for my birthday dinner...thank god! Otherwise, I would have been wine-less the entire time. I did have one glass on my first night and couldn't take more than 2 sips! My room was nice...yes the beds are hard, I woke up one night realizing my arm had fallen asleep. I called them and they re-made my bed the next day with a mattress pad - much more comfortable!! The beach was fantastic, but it was a busy time so if you arrived past 11 am, it was very hard to find a chair. Ditto for the Yucatan pool...most good locations are reserved at 8 am. The Tequila pool always had a few chairs avaialble, even some under palapas but you had to dig a bit for one. The beach is amazing, be careful because for about the first foot or so there is a build up of coral and shells that may hurt your feet a bit. But after that, it's smooth and beautiful! This is a great resort if you have kids - there were children from 6 weeks to 16 years everywhere, all seemed to be having a good time. The sports bar is a great place...lots of tv's to watch games, some pool tables ($3.00 per game), air hockey games and some video games. The sports bar is open 24 hours, there are nibblies there if you get late night munchies. The one thing I have to comment on is the vibe at the Tequila. It's so festive, everyone is so friendly and I ended up meeting some wonderful people. I felt nearly at home here, I could easily go back and am contemplating making the Tequila my annual birthday venue!

What a place to have a reunion!!!!! So here it is good and bad. We left Denver 6 hours later than we were supposed to, and of course we were a little tired and frustrated from our delay, but, that all was forgotten when we arrived at our resort! Wow, it was everything the reviews on your site said it would be, and more. We were met at curbside with beautiful drinks and some of our classmates that had travelled from different parts of the US, what a nice way to begin our stay!! True to claims on your site, the beds were hard, but I will say that not one of us ended up not sleeping well, or with a back ache! About tipping the maid, it did not seem to matter how you tipped, we got the same treatment whether we tipped or not, and a couple of the days we did tip, the service was just ok. So, I am not sure if it pays to tip....The humididty was high, and the rooms were a bit musty, but, hey, we were by the ocean!!! The buffets had a huge variety to offer, still by the end of the stay it would have gotten monotonous had it not been for the evening dinners that one could book each day. I would reccomend the steak house. Otherwise we found the resort to be beautiful, and relaxed, no one bugging you to get up and join in if you chose not to! We really enjoyed the pool bars at the resorts that we were able to share exchange with!! The bartenders are great fun and very attentive. The walk to the beach was great! We even on one occasion got to see a group of monkeys lounging in a tree along the walkway!! The walk was welcome, as we all certainly ate quite well everyday. The beach..........beautiful!!!!!!!! Not once did we have trouble finding loungers for our whole group of eleven! I would reccomend highly the trip to Chichen Itsa!!!! The trip takes a long day, but absolutely worth it!! Wish we had had more time there. I would certainly go back to the same resort but would skip some of the sillier tours such as the bar hopper tour, a joke in my opinion, and the Pirate Assult, which our Apple Representative put us on instead of the Captain Hook Dinner Cruise that we asked for and thought we were going on, dissapointing.

($5 us in a taxi) We did consider the Yucatan and Playacar but we got a better deal at the Tequila probably because it does not have a beach front. This was not a problem as it is only a 6-7 min walk or a ride in the buggy to get to the beach. We found the Tequila to have a warmer feel to it and would certainly return here in the future.

It's funny what you read in the reviews as we see that there is some people that complains just about everything. I have personnaly travelled in RIU Hotels quite a few times and I have always been very satisfied. I am also going back to RIU Ocho Rios in Jamaica in January so you can see that I like this brand of hotel. This one in particular is very nice. The grounds are awesome, it's very clean, even the rooms and the pool is huge with a very long pool bar. Always had a seat available in the pool. Food was OK. There is a lot of mexican food but I guess that is to be expected. A lot of variaty but same thing pretty much every day. We also had lunch at the Yucatan beach restaurant and food was OK there too but we prefered lunch at the Tequila. It's too bad we couldn't have dinner at the Asian restaurant at the Yucatan... I would have really liked that. The grill restaurant is very good... This was our favorite. The Mexican restaurant (which is actually at the Yucatan) we didn't really like... The appetizers were good but the main course was not as much.. In our opinion anyway. Make sure to make your reservation close to 7:00 am otherwise, if you wait past that, there is only availibility for dinner at 9:00pm which I found to be too late. Youcan only make your reservation in the morning for dinner on the same night. The beach is absolutely fabulous. There is a shuttle every 5-10 minutes if you don't want to walk. The is plenty of chairs but not a lot of shade. We spent a lot of time in the pool at the Yucatan also. The Mojitos in the pool bar (the one beside the restaurant - there is 2) are the best. There is definitely more kids at this hotel that at the Tequila. The staff was extremely friendly and service was great too. Since we were 3, we asked for a rollaway bed and it wasn't a problem. They called us 3 times to see if we we were OK and ask if we were missing anything. One day we even had a platter a fresh fruits on our desk when we came back in the afternoon. I had never seen that before. Altough they don't ask for tips, we did give some everday...especialy to the maid. It preferable that you give some on a daily basis instead of waiting at the end of the week as the one that cleans you room when you leave might not be the same one that cleaned it every other day. She always made litthe animals with the towels. Some I had never seen and it was quite funny. The only thing I would have to complain about is that the rooms and the lobby needs to be refreshed. The comforter in our room was very old and ripped and needed to be replaced. The sofas in the lobby are also ripped. The should invest in making there look a little younger. Rooms, mine anyway, is very plain and is missing decorations. Colour are also of poor taste. Again, not sure it was like that in every room but it seemed like it. I know you don't spend a lot of time in the room and we are basically only there to sleep but this is something that is important for me.

Last time we went in the middle of Jan and we didn't have any rain, this time we had rain almost everyday. Rooms- We were very happy with the rooms- clean, well stocked, everything worked, no musty smell (we brought an air freshener just in case)... the beds are hard so req extra pillows and blankets. Food- Great food, lots of variety... certain non-english speaking guests do not understand the concept of a line and cut in front of you while getting food- this does get annoying. Last time they had more shrimp and steak, this time lots of maui maui, salmon, mexican. Pools- Pools were nice, they clean them throughout the day, the pool bar staff is great- remember to bring lg mugs and ask specifically for the alcohol you want. IE don't say White Russian, say White Russian with Kaluah and Smirnoff... don't say rum and diet pepsi- say Bacarrdi and Pepsi Light. If you don't say the liquor you want they put whatever they have and it is not as good. Just ask and they will happily give it to you. Beach is very nice- we only went down there once- the pool at the tequila is too nice and the food at the lupita too good for lunch to make us want to leave. Oh yeah- this resort is very international so get used to males in little speedo's and women topless- both at the beach and the pool. Other info- shopping- go to playa del carmen and have fun most shops sell the same thing and the price is very different from one to the next so do not buy right away- prices lowest in the middle of 5th ave- not in the beginning. The little plaza next to the tequila is nice... we bought most of our wraps for $5 there and most of our necklaces for $5 also- the jewelry store at the very end of the plaza has so nice jewelry for great prices- I bought some nice earrings for $29 (silver, and opal) there that the vendors in our hotel lobby who had a similar set wanted $171 for- watch out for the lobby jewelry vendors. We went to Xel-Ha as our only excursion- this is our 3rd time. We paid $75 got a direct shuttle from the hotel (funjet/lomas rep) to xel-ha with an all-inclusive all day deal. (normally $87 and you have to take a big bus with a ton of stops)- we ate breakfast when we got there- and then sat around and had lime daquaris and margaritas- then took the train to the back of the park and snorkeled down- no one else does this, the water won't be stirred up so you will see a ton of things- we saw a giant sea turtle, sting rays, 1000s jelly fish on the bottom, 1000s fish of all varietys, At lunch we ate again at the mexican lindo and the the steak with cheese and shrimp sauce- and more drinks. Nice trip! Final advice- bring good shoes with band aids, bring lg mugs for drinks, go to xel-ha all day w/shuttle, ask for prem liquor, if you get your hair braided go to the plaza just outside the resort-$30 or $20 half head, and bring lots of lotion.", "Date": "December 10, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Niagara Falls", "Title": "\u201cJust returned from Riu Tequila today, Dec 4/06.\u201d", "Author": "Inky3728", "ReviewID": "UR6333730", "Content": "We just returned today, Dec 4/06 from the Riu Tequila. Having vacationed at other 5 star all inclusive resorts previously, comparisons can be made. The Tequila should, in our opnion, be rated a 4 star at best. It is a very attractive and clean resort and the staff is friendly when greeted. You will find the basics you need in your room but we had to request an iron and ironing board and went without a coffee maker and coffee which we have been used to. Also, the rooms can be on the \"damp\" side, especially in the evenings. However, the cleaning staff does an excellent job. Please, leave a \"little something\" for them. It is appreciated. We found a large variety of food at the Buffet early in our vacation but it did tend to become repetitive by the middle and end of our holiday. We made reservations early (7-8am) for Lupitas Steakhouse on the two days we ate there. The choices from the menu were limited but the meals were tasty. The pool area was clean and beautiful with gorgeous foliage bordering the area. Getting to the beach tended to be a little inconvenient at times, ... I'll get into that in a minute.

All in all, we enjoyed many laughs with our friends, (3 couples, 45-55 yrs.), and have great memories. The main downfall of our vacation had nothing to do with the resort at all but had everything to do with the other guests. We met wonderful people from Canada, the U.S., etc, however it took everything to retain our postive attitudes when being side checked and literally bowled over by very rude German guests who lack good manners when it came to waiting their turn in cases like boarding the shuttle to the beach, standing in line at the Buffet, walking past you on the pathways, getting a drink at the bar, etc. I guess it is just something Canadians can't get used to, who knows? Nevertheless, we had a great time at the Riu Tequila where we got great tans and shared many a laugh, even with the Germans there!

We purchased flight tickets from Apollo/Novair and accommodation directly from the hotels. Hotels as we, on TripAdvisor - a service that I find very useful, found two hotels that appealed to us; the Riu Tequila and the Iberostar Quetzal. As a result we feed back this comparison between the two hotels (both rated among the best in Playa del Carmen). Playa del Carmen is perfectly situated along a paradise beach; palms, lovely soft white sand and the magnificent blueish warm ocean. A walk along the beach reveals that the hotels/resorts at the south-end have utilized the beach in a better way. As a general recommendation to anyone looking for accommodation in Playa del Carmen: Narrow down your selection to the hotels south of, and including, Riu Playacar. See http://www.cancunmap.com/assist/playa_hotel_locator.html. Riu Tequila was in many ways luxurious, yet down-to-earth. Most of the guests at the Riu Tequila came from Europe (countries/regions like UK, Germany, and Scandinavia). The room was in no means luxurious, rather basic - still clean, quite, and with two comfortable beds. The staff (all mexican, I think) were great and the overall attitude was friendly and familiar. The resort is very safe and family friendly. We ate all our breakfasts and dinners in the main buffet restaurant, and most of our lunches at the pool restaurant (Lupita). Both restaurants had a broad selection of good food. The breakfasts were overwhelming, and the dinners just as good. In fact, we didn't see ANY reasons at all to utilize the a la carte restaurants. The hotel arranged activities during pretty much the entire day, activities like air gun competition, water aerobic, diving, volleyball, boule, spanish lesson, etc. We participated in a few of these activities and we found it to be great fun. We didn't go on any excursions outside of the resort due to the fact that we only had one week's vacation. Next time I'd rent a car. The pools was clean and sufficient in size, with plenty of sun-beds both in sunny and shady areas. The pool bar was \"classy\" and the Mojitos perfect. Due to the jet-lag we didn't spend many late nights out - and we totally missed the discotheque. The nights we did stay up, the nightly entertainment made it purpose, although it was a bit hokey. One (minor) drawback of Riu Tequila is that it's situated 800-1600 m from the beach. The transport itself was less of a problem as the \"burden\" of 5-10 minutes walk or a few minutes ride in the small golf cart/shuttle is reasonably small. The issue is more in the area of coordination, at least if you, as us, feel that you'll need to keep together as a family. Luckily Riu let you utilize the facilities of Riu Yucatan - it's close to the beach, the pool and pool area were great, but the buffet restaurant and bars were overloaded by guests (from Riu Tequila?). The only truly negative aspect is that I find it very likely that personnel at Riu, or the closely associated Hotel Beds, fleece their customers whenever it's possible. Thus, DO NOT trust Riu's complementary transportation between the airport and the hotel. Conclusion: Iberostar Quetzal is in my opinion a slightly better option then Riu Tequila (and much better then Riu Yucatan)... so if you can afford the extra cost, it's a given... and if you can't, I can assure you'll be very satisfied with Riu Tequila.", "Date": "November 26, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dumfries, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cgoing back february\u201d", "Author": "1968birchwood", "ReviewID": "UR6152214", "Content": "First time in mexico ,have stayed at various other rius in dom rep and europe.First impression of tequila was very favourable ,the rest of holiday was even better.

Upon our arrival, we were greeted with friendly staff who presented us with drinks. They were completely organized with handing out room keys and towel cards. The grounds at the Tequila are impeccable and the resort is well laid out. Our room was very clean. We noticed the hair dryer was not working well from the beginning. When we contacted the front desk, they assured us it would be taken care of quickly. Sure enough, within 15 minutes, a technician was there to replace it. We had a second floor room with a balcony overlooking the pool area. There were plenty of mature trees in front of us blocking the view of the pool but that was fine. It gave us some privacy and drowned out the noise from the pool area. The food was incredible. There are tons of choices to choose from for breakfast, lunch and dinner. It was all tasty as well. We ate at the Steakhouse one night and it was pleasant to sit outdoors and be served with a real steak. We never tried the other a la carte restaurant (Mexicano) since we enjoyed the regular buffet tremendously. The bars were all awesome. One thing I noticed; the staff work very hard and are not extending their hands out for tips. I'm sure they would appreciate it as we did give some occassionally. They are always smiling and playing around with each other. They create a positive atmosphere. It shows that they love what they do. Once they know you and remember what you drink, they usually have a fresh one waiting for you when your current drink is running low. Try the Blue Ocean or Doctor Funk. They are awesome drinks. They also make a great Pina Colada. Don't be afraid to ask for a little extra alcohol if you want more punch to it. Be careful as they can hit you hard when you least expect it. They have tons of staff on hand for cleaning and serving. I think the ratio is 1 for every 2 guests. They all work diligently to make you happy. Please give them the respect they deserve. I witnessed some guests who were treating the staff like crap. It's too bad they don't realize how good they have it there. The beach is beautiful. It is a small walk (5 mins.) or you can take the little shuttle over. Eating lunch is available at the Yucatan or Playacar Resorts which are located right at the beach. Those are part of RIU and you can have access to most of their facilities for food and....... of course drinks. Things to do. 1) shopping on 5th Ave. It's a $5 US or $50 pesos taxi ride. There is a large assortment of things to buy there. Tons of silver vendors. Watch for the code 925 stamped on the metal. That's the symbol required to prove its authenticity. Do not be afraid to barter. There is always room to negotiate. We purchased an item that originally was $85 US asking price. Our final price was $35 US. They will try to get you at first, so play with them. Walk away if they don't budge on price. You will find the same item somewhere else for less. The conversion for money is $1.00 US to $11pesos. 2) Xcel-Ha (pronounced Chelha) is a natural wonder. There are dolphins to see and if you pay the extra denaros, you can swim with them. We paid about $80 US to go there which included lunch and snorkel equipment. You need to snorkel there. It's awesome. If you never tried it, here's the place to do it. Lots of beautiful fish. They come right up to you. We even saw a stingray at the bottom. There's a cave you can go into. It's a must do. There's cliffs to jump off into the water, a lazy river ride on a tube etc. It's about 45 mins from the resort. 3) Tulum ruins. This is a spectacular site to see. Buildings of stone built thousands of years ago. The highlight was walking up to the cliff and there was the ocean down below. An incredible color of blue and sand that we have never experienced before. It was truly paradise. Bring your swimsuit and make sure you have it on you as there are no change rooms available. You'll want to go in as it gets quite hot there. It's refreshing and incredible. Cost is about $40 US which includes a bus to get you there and back. It's about an hour from the resort. 4) Cozumel Island. WOW...... A hidden gem. Take the ferry from Playa DEL Carmen. It's $20 US per person return and it's about a half hour cruise. Things to know..... There are plenty of car and scooter rental people around. We rented a jeep for the day and it cost us about $75 US. Some people may find that expensive but hey we cruised the whole island with it. We stopped at Park Chankanaab to see the dolphins and snorkeling that is to die for. The water is so clear, we were able to see about 100 feet (33 meters) away. They have you going close to the reef but not in it. Obviously for safety reasons. The colors of fish were stunning. If you drive on the East side of the island, there are beached scattered around that are unpopulated. The waves are quite high but it can be dangerous with undertows.. You can shop right in San Miguel. That's where the ferry brings you. Again, lots of variety and negotiate plenty. You need a full day there. 5) Snorkeling or diving is available right at the resort. We booked a snorkeling tour through Scuba Caribe for $30US per person. They took us on a boat about 15 minutes away to an actual barrier reef. They literally bring you in it. That was absolutely one of the most amazing experience for both of us. Bring an underwater camera. We met the most wonderful people. Karen and Michelle from Toronto..... Phil and Tonita from Wales and mostly Tam and Julie from England who we spent some great quality time with them. They were the most amazing couple. We had a great time. Tam and Julie, if you're reading this, we miss you already. Overall, the RIU Tequila is an amazing resort. Go there. You will not be disappointed. It's worth every penny.

My husband and I (29 yrs old) brought our 9 yr old daughter and 5 yr old son for a one week stay on Nov. 6-13. PRIOR TO ARRIVAL Once we got off the plane, we got our baggage and headed through customs, where we pushed a button which turns either red or green. Green means go, and well I can't say what happens if you get a red light, as we went straight through with the green light. BE aware of the porters at the airport, they are aggressive. My husband knew of this ahead of time and still got suckered into paying one $5 US for a 5 step walk to our bus (no joke! It's that close.) Once on the bus, you didn't realize the ride took 45 mins because you were welcomed with drinks (2 beers for $5 and pop and water for the kids for $1). You were then given your wrist bands for the hotel and checked in while on the bus (AMAZING). We were also given a run down of what to expect and we were told we would have a \"welcome introduction\" the following morning from our tour operator (Sunquest). UPON ARRIVAL Once we arrived at the hotel, we were greated with drinks, our luggage was taken care of by the staff and we just picked up our room and safe keys (took 2 mins top and we were off to our room). About 10 mins later, our bags arrived in our rooms. It was now 10am and we had the whole day ahead of us. Although check in isn't until the afternoon, all 190 rooms were ready for us upon arrival. BALCONIES My 5 yr old son, was on a chair on the balcony and jumped and hurt himself on the balcony, so a quick warning, watch small kids on the balcony. (the railings aren't that high, like in Canada) WEATHER When reading reviews, I never read much about weather, which was of most importance to me so here is the weather forcast for my duration. We arrived and it rained for about 5 mins, the sun was then shinning strong for the rest of the day, in the evening during the show (10pm) it rained for the duration of the show (30 mins) then it stopped. Our second day, we had a beautiful day until the afternoon when it rained for about an hour, then returned to a beautiful day. The next 3 days were AMAZING! With the 6th day being overcast in the morning from an early thunderstorm (started around 6am) was cleared up by noonish. We left early the following day. Overall, the weather was very good to us. The evenings were cool to me, as I get cold easily so bring a light sweater for the shows. (it's the fans that made me cold) STAFF (& Entertainment) I have to comment on all the staff. Especially the animation staff. Wow...we really don't know what hard work is. These guys were working from early morning until late night. They ran games all day (play the games, they are so much fun, especially boccia). They welcomed you at dinner and then they did the Mini Disco at the kids club and the show in the evening. Kids can take part in all the games (eg. my kids played Boccia with me) or they can take part in the kids club. I didnt' think I would feel comfortable leaving my kids with the staff but after you get to know the staff, you are 100% satisfied that your children are in GREAT hands. Every night before the show, they have an awards ceremony for those who won in the games played earlier that day. They have certificates and bandana's. It was a nice touch. One request I have of all visitors. TIP the staff. Only $1 US is so appreciated. They work so hard. Too many people DON\"T tip! In fact, we were a minority, one in very few people tipped. If anyone was rude, I would have to say it was the guest. I think any complaints that you read come from guest who expect perfection! The world isn't perfect but the Riu is as perfect as it could possibly get. SMOKING The only complaints I have are, for one, the smoking. If your a smoker, no problem, but if you are not (I HATE SMOKE) it is quite uncomfortable dealing with all the smoke, especially in the shows. YUK! I had to miss a large majority of the shows because I couldn't stand the chain smokers. Nor did I want my kids taking in all that second hand smoke. COMPLAINTS Reading the reviews I wondered how people could have such different opinions of the same things and it comes down to this, everyone has different expectations. If you are a reasonable person, you will with out a doubt enjoy yourself to the fullest. If you are over the top, like so many others, you will find fault in everything and anything. Yes the beds were hard, however, I thought they were very comfortable. The beds will differ to everyone, some will like, some will not. The showers (no bathtub) have a high pressure. Some like this (my husband) and some may not, like my children. I did get a burn, and the shower pressure was stinging me after burning. Do not buy anything at the resort, everything is overpriced. MINI DISCO The kids mini disco takes place at 7:30pm. They do some dancing and my kids LOVED it. One night at the Playa resort, they had a Pinata. This is the kids fondest memory re: kids club. I have a mini clip if you want me to email it to you. During the day the kids club had games and movies, but they didn't seem to take place at the little kids hut where the playground was. It took some time for me to figure this out. POOL Not much to say here except WOW! The water was warm. If it was cold, I was so hot by the time I jumped in, it was nothing more than refreshing. The sunbeds in the water were awesome, so refreshing during tanning. The pool bar was not full at any point, my kids sat there all the time ordering drinks. They have a red slush for kids to drink (we thought it was alcoholic and missed out until the 5th day into our vacation). It is really refreshing (as I don't drink). FOOD Amazing selection coming from the pickest of the picky. The smoothies in the morning were so yummy (try the pinapple). Lunch offered pasta made fresh to order daily, accept on the weekend. Dinner at the buffet offered everything you can imagine. HUGE shrimps, steaks, chicken, burgers, pasta, salad bar, dessert bar (not that good, accept for the fruit and ice cream which melts quickly). Too much to mention but nothing to complain about. BEACH I have never seen a beach like this (I have only been to Florida). The sand was like powder. The walk was 5 mins, if that, through a nicely shaded path which the golf cart travels if you prefer to take it. (we saw guest fighting each other down for the golf cart at times so we preferred to walk most of the time). My daughter was injured on the beach (little cut on her hand). The lifegaurd was of great assistance, he cleaned it up and bandaged it for her. I agree with most that the Yucatan does seem run down (compared to the Tequila) and I wouldn't like to be in the hotel servicing all the sister resorts. The food seemed to run out at times (although replaced quickly). To me, there wasn't a comparison when it came to the food at the Yucatan with that of the Tequila. Also, we met visitors that were staying at the Yucatan and Playacar and they all said they prefer and have been spending there time at Tequila. PLAYA DEL CARMEN A $5(US) taxi ride or a 20 min walk. The walk is hard to do with kids, and the heat. The shopping was good, mostly the liqour. Wow, so cheap. We went to Walmart, which is just off of 5th avenue. Walk north on 5th avenue until you reach the Burger King then turn left (NORTH) about 4-5 blocks and you will hit the Walmart (liqour is even cheaper here). Tip: bring a napsack shopping with you, especially when buying liqour, it gets heavy. The bus terminal and/or ferry are both easily found in playa del carmen. The buses take you to Xcaret for $2.50 (US) and Xel-Ha (can't remember exactly but I think about $4(US). EXCURSIONS They are expensive. We bought outside of the resort. It was so much safer and easier than you think. We found tickets in playa del carmen for cheaper. BE CAREFUL not to purchase of those selling timeshares. We found a place on 5th avenue, not far from Burger King (a bit further up 5th Avenue) on the same side of the road as BK. This place is not just a booth that could be moved but a situated business. We paid $200 (US) for a family of 4 to attend Xel-Ha, all inclusive. My son was free, even though you need to be 4yrs to get in free. I would suggest all inclusive as it is a bit pricy in the park. My family loved Xel-Ha but I am not an outdoorsy kind of person. BRING OFF! and also make sure your sunscreen is biodigradable. They only give you sunscreen if you give them yours, otherwise, you have to buy it and it is about $18 (US). HAIR BRAIDING/MASSAGES Both of the above seem to be very popular. Don't go to the resort. You can do both for very cheap in Playa Del Carmen (PDC). My daughter and I did a half head for $10 each in town. Much more at resort. Also a 2 hr massage (although I didn't get one) was only $35 in town but ALOT more on the resort for a shorter period. A-LA-CARTE Some are just fine with buffet everynight, that is because it is that good, but I really enjoyed the Steak House. The food was great the service was awesome and finally dessert tasted unbelievably. It was amazing how they turn the busy lunch area into an amazing night out. I had the skewers (shrimp and steak) and everyone else had steak, although there is chicken and BBQ ribs. We didn't make it to the Beach Club because we really liked the steak house and went there twice. It's nice to save an a-la-carte for your last night. ROOMS Very clean and spacious. I was on the 2nd floor. Room 211. I would recommend this room, I was the closest to the reception and they pool. It was very convenient with no complaints of noise from the reception/buffet (ect). PICTURES They have hotel photographers that take pictures of you during the day at the beach and pool, with Auguna's and parrots. The pics with the animals are $8.50 (us) and the pictures without animals are $6.50. They always turn out so nice, just remember they take them everyday.

The time that has passed however has not quieted my excitement or satisfaction over the wonderful wedding and honeymoon we had. Everything was perfect!!! It was a dream wedding. We could not have imagined nor hoped for more. The wedding coordinators thought of everything and made our wedding a stress free event. I requested flower arrangements for the reception the night before the wedding and I was told \"no problem\". Try that on a florist in the United States...they'd freak out! The last minute arrangements were beautiful and looked as though they had been part of the plan the entire time. We did not have a choice for the photographer/videographer we used as we were required to use the hotel photographer/videographer. Our pictures were stunning. We could not have hand picked a more talented photographer. The reception was a ton of fun! We customized it by requesting the last seating for dinner so we could have cocktails and socialize for the hours in between the wedding and dinner. We paid for canapes (very small cost per person) so people would not be starving and too tipsy by dinner - delicious! IMPORTANT...when the wedding coordinator advises you to have the mariachi...follow her advise. We had them for an hour. When it was over and the were leaving, my husband ended up chasing after them and paying them to stay for another! They created such a fun and celebratory atmosphere. I was concerned before the wedding about the bathing suit clad crowd on the beach. They ended up adding even more joy. People were lined up cheering when I arrived with the girls on the beach-cart. We felt like we were famous! Then, the roar that came up as Michael and I were pronounced husband and wife just made the moment. I also had concerns about our reception in the steak house instead of a private room. Again, it was great. They set our banquet tables off around the corner and it felt like we were alone. Meanwhile, everyone who was in the bar during cocktails or in the steakhouse during dinner was so excited for us, kind and congratulatory that they too added joy to our wonderful day. We were at Riu Tequila for almost a week before the wedding with our friends and family and stayed for an additional week for our honeymoon. This is the way to go. Once we kissed everyone good-bye, we were able to relax and enjoy our honeymoon instantly! We spent lots of time in town as we hadn't left the resort the week before with our guests. The restaurants and night life in Playa continue year after year to get better and better. Amazing! Michael and I have been traveling to PDC for 8 years and can't believe the changes. The advise I have to brides-and-grooms-to-be considering a wedding at Riu Tequila is don't get lost in the details...they do it for you and it's beautiful! Also, don't panic when they don't move at the snap of a set of fingers...their culture is more relaxed. They do everything perfectly without hysteria. It's quite refreshing!

Our room was huge / spotlessly clean and very nice. The grounds are lovely \u2013 lots of colourful plants. Birds we have never seen before. Animals that run around that we have also never seen and the largest lizards ever. The main dining room is beautiful. You will be greeted each night by the staff at the door and taken to a table. Each night there are usually dancing girls or the 3 omegos stood playing by the door one night. Rui Tequila in our opinion is the best of the 2 similar hotels to stay at. The other 2 are on the sea front and tend to be used by everyone, so are a little more tired \u2013 Having said that they are also still beautiful. The pool and swim up bar are fantastic. When we were there all 6 of us never had trouble to find a sun lounger by the pool and we are not people who put towels out at 6.30 in the morning. The free cocktails are superb and so is the free mini bar and optics in your room (Still water, fizzy water, Corona beer, pepsi, lemonade and I\u2019m sure there were othere but I can\u2019t remember what). But why would you want to drink in your room when you could sit at the beach bar gazing at the clear blue sea. The beach is wonderful. White sugar soft sand and the clearest water I have ever seen. Tiny fish swim around your feet while you paddle and there was a resident pelican that seemed to land in the sea in the middle of everyone in the water, every day. One man had hold of the pelican\u2019s beak and was turning it from left to right and it didn\u2019t flinch one bit. Both our sons did the paragliding on the beach with their girlfriends and said it was wonderful. We did a trip called jungle tour. It was a speed boat that you drove yourself following the guide in his boat, but believe me you are moving at a fair speed. If you do this trip make sure you wear t-shirts and lots of sun cream on your face (cos you will burn). After around 20minutes you arrive at a coral reef which you swim around. The fish and plant life will blow you away. WOW! Make sure you take high factor sun cream on this holiday and lots of it as to buy sun cream here is very expensive!!! Also take some form of lotion to put on incase you burn. We jumped into a taxi one day to Playa Del Carmen and this only cost us $5. \u2013 Well worth a visit.

Lets start from the beginning.... booked with Thomson and flying from Birmingham. Check-in was quite a lengthy process and they are very vigilant on weight restrictions. They charge \u00a39 per kg of extra baggage and believe me, a lot of people were getting charged. The heightened security levels meant that we had to go straight through to departures as the queue to get through passport control snaked around the whole of the second floor. Once through there was penty to keep you amused. ThomsonFly as an airline is really not to be recommended. Aircraft was very tired, staff were more like bad waiting staff than cabin crew. They came round to sell (predictably overpriced) drinks and snacks only 3 times in ten hours and at one point they said that they were all going on a break and left us to it. I think its better to gloss over the flight as it is not an experience worth recalling (best part is that the return journey was only 8.5 hrs!) On arriving at the Cancun airport we were sheparded into a queue for immigration which all went smoothly and us and our bags were soon on the coach headed for the hotel. Transfer time about an hour. Upon arrival you are given a wristband to wear for the duration of your stay. We were offered a welcome drink and given our room key safe key and a map of the hotel. No-one was available to show us where our room was so it took us a while to work it out. Bags were delivered by 2 porters who both expected a tip. The room was very nice, 2 queen sized beds, table & 2 chairs, balcony, tv, annexed off bathroom area with seperate toilet and shower. There was a fridge with soft drinks, water and beer and 4 optics of spirits. Aircon worked well, in fact we were actually cold some nights! The beds are as hard as mentioned in previous reviews, but we didn't notice any musty smells. Do be prepared for some wildlife though, we had little lizardy-type creatures in our rooms most days but they're more scared of you than vice versa. The hotel was lovely, the staff could not do enough for you. 2 pools, plenty of sunbeds and lots of shade, which you need, as it was really hot and humid. The grounds were immaculate. The beach was stunning, but it's a shame that there wasn't any shade. Don't worry about the short walk to the beach, it's actually very pleasant. The golfcart transfer was really only used by americans! There are plenty of activities to keep you amused and the staff work really hard. The also know when to leave you in peace so don't hassle you to keep doing things. The main buffet restaurant was very good, with lots of choice and not too busy. We always enjoyed it although I can imagine some people finding it repetitive. BBQ's on the terrace were a nice touch. Dessert was a bit disappointing, lots of little cakes but they all tasted the same. There are 2 restaurants available to book, but only if you're an early riser as places went fast. The steakhouse was a disaster, I think they made the place as dark as possible to disguise the sub-standard food. Very disappointed. The other restaurant is a short walk away on the beach bu the Riu Yucutan. Lovely surroundings and much better food. Breakfast at the buffet was great, not normally a breakfast person but we went every day. Lunch was available by the pool and there was a good selection. You could also use the facilities at the 2 other Riu's but had to have dinner at your own hotel. Bars were great, we worked our way down the cocktail list and can also recommend the banana milkshakes. The swim up bar was wonderful, although crowded at times. As for trips, the Thomson reps will try to sell you everything but we weren't impressed with their service level so would recommend booking your own. Plenty of companies out there will pickup from the hotel. We went to Chichen Itza which was worth doing but a long hot trek. Tulum was beautiful, but best of all we had booked the sealife discovery plus at Dolphin Discovery ($16 cab ride away). This was by far the highlight of our holiday. Xcaret was also great fun, the underground river was so much fun. Do remember that you can't take normal sunscreen there though as only biodegradable ones are allowed. Well I think i've gone on for long enough, I hope this has been helpful. I know previous posts helped me plan my trip so wanted to share my thoughts. We had a great trip and would thoroughly recommend this hotel and Playacar in general.

The immigration and customs went fine and was quicker than we had been told. The transfer was fine, about 45 mins. When we arrived at the hotel, the rooms were allocated very efficiently, with a welcome drink to go with it. Our room was of reasonable size, overlooking a golf course, ( this was being extended, but the work did not bother us). The room appeared pleasant, with the cleaner leaving towels in the shape of two swans. During the two weeks we were there the room appeared damp, with a small leak when it rained. this was not fixed while we were there. The swim up bar was really nice with great bar staff, but this closed after 3 days and was emptied for maintainance. This left half the pool open, (not the swim up part). We were offered a change of hotel though by our holiday company, to the Riu Playa Car, or The Riu Yucatan, but declined as we already thought the staff at the Tequila were so friendly, and we could use the facilities at the other hotels in any case. The 800m walk to the beach was nice and shaded so we never used the \"golf trolley\". As stated the staff were all very friendly, and hard working. The animation staff were particularly very good. The weather was hot and humid, but 3 cloudy days, five or six raining in the afternoon, the rest sunny. The beach was great and we always got a sun bed. the sea was clear and warm. We used some of the beach facilities, kayaks, snorkel gear. There was plenty of choice for breakfast, and the evening buffet was nice, but could repeat a bit. We booked the steakhouse three times, and enjoyed it twice, with the last time not so good. We went to Excaret $78, and really enjoyed it with the dolphin experience being very good (better than when we did it on Isla Margarita). The Canote was really an experience not to miss. Xelhar all inclusive $99 was also a nice trip if you like to snorkel with fish. Playa del carmen was a $5 ride away, and was typically touristy, with a lot of pestering to come in the shops, (when will they learn the English will not buy things when pestered).

I was here for so long that I was able to get a good feel and know all the ins and outs of the hotel. Go use the pool and beach at the Riu Yucatan. The steakhouse is the best meal in town I think. It has SUPERB steaks in the evenings. We ate at the seafood place a couple of times, but I'm not much of a seafood person at all, so I won't comment on this one. It wouldn't be fair. The walk down to the beach is nice. I walked it everyday. If I was tired, I rode the \"limo-golfcart.\" He would stop and offer me a ride when he saw me. The regular buffet here is the largest one I have ever seen. The dining room is enormous. I can't say enough about the food. I was here a month and didn't even try it all in that period of time. TONS of food. They stocked the refrigerators every other day with sodas, beer, and water. We left a couple of dollars and requested what we wanted. It was always there along with \"animal towels\" on the bed. We did have a couple of scorpions in our room. They were small and always dead by the morning when we found them, but it wasn't a good feeling. I always shook my clothes and shoes out. Service here was my ONLY complaint. Of course I was here a long time and experienced more than most will, but I wanted to take a plate back to my room to eat a couple of nights. The first night I had no problem. The second, I was practically tackled. She would not allow me to. She snatched the plate away from me and said it wasn't allowed. I had no time to explain that I worked all day and just wanted to go back to the room. I guess they thought I was taking food to someone. I don't really know. She got the plate and left. I just went back and got another one before she came back. The other man at the door just waved me on. Who knows. The other problem I had was that I needed ONE more day after 4 WEEKS. I booked online and assumed that they were going to take it from my credit card. They called my room and told my babysitter that they wanted my stuff out of the room immediately. I was at work again and didn't get back until that evening. They were sitting in the lobby crying. Then they said they were booked. I called my travel agent and they booked me a room there immediately. hmmmmm....guess they weren't booked. Front desk people were very rude. I had heard good things about Nacho and Jessica, but they were rude to me from day one. For the most part, the hotel is nice. Nice landscape. Nice pools. Wonderful food. Most employees were nice.

In the evening there was a show every night and twice we were there there was a market in the hotel selling jewellery and such.

For breakfast..eggs anyway you like them, bacon, sausage, toast, bread, 8 different cereals, doughnuts, mexican food, 10 different types of fruit juice and much more!!

Mexico is a hot place and you have to use high factor sun creams, it's in the caribbean for goodness sake! Frankly we have never felt heat like it and the few cloudy days we did have were a blessing but we went for the sun and the sea and we loved it. The food hall is massive and as it's a buffet you get to try foods you prob wouldn't dream of we found the selection fine, there is also the Steak house and the mexicana which is on the beach front. The only thing we would have alittle moan about was the build up to the main show. It was a little too Butlins for us and the house bad were well shocking, they were on every other day and did the same set each time. Though the main shows were brilliant, the dancers worked so hard and seemed to love perfoming for you.

You could even request the maid to bring you specific drinks. We went to the beach most days which was stunning and we saw so many tropical fish in the sea, even a sea snake! They were such beautiful colours, and the sand was so soft. You could even take all kinds of drinks from the neighbouring Yucatan hotel down to the beach with you, a shandy was perfect to cool down in the shade with. You could also eat at the Yucatan. I think for me one of the best things was the food. I was astounded at the array on offer. Like one evening they had sushi, mussels, avocado just for starters. I ended up just eating that all night! And it was all you can eat, any food you could think of they would have there and they also had themed nights. I put on about half a stone! haha! They must have had 20 different cereals aswell!

We were greeted at the hotel with a welcome drink and our room key and safe key were ready waiting for us so we were in our room within 5 minutes of arriving - which after a 12 hour flight was a very good thing. The rooms are basic but very clean and functional. You have a minibar plus spirits on optic, air con and ceiling fan. There is a shower (note - no bath) and two small double beds and a TV. The rooms are cleaned every day and each day you get a new animal created out of towels (sounds silly but quite funny). Food. Huge selection of food to suit all tastes and ages. If you want to eat nothing but pizza, hot dogs and chips then you can, or if you want something a little different then the choice is excellent from sushi one night, to BBQ's and every night there is a cavery roast and pasta bar. There is also a large salad bar and soup for both lunch and dinner. Breakfast was equally as good with a massive selection of both hot food, cereal and fruit. Drink. Minibar contained 2 bottles of Corona upon ariival, and when it was refilled (as it was every day) as I had drunk those I was rewarded with 4 every day after. The bars outside the room are all well staffed and never did I have to wait more than a couple of minutes for a lager or Pina Colada for the wife. Entertainment. During the day there are games in one half of the pool and on the football pitch and volleyball court that you can join in with if you get bored of sunbathing. In the evening the entertainment kicks off about 9.30 and again is excellent and appeals to all ages. There were Grease, Michael Jackson and numerous other dance / song shows, plus more audience participation shows including a surprisingly funny karaoke evening. After the entertainment finishes the disco opens until about 4am, and the Sports Bar (this shows so much English football, more even than in the UK) is open 24/7 and has food that you can help yourself to. Beach. 5 minute walk from the reception of the Riu Tequila but much of that is in the shade and there is a little golf cart that runs all day if walking is a problem. It's clean, loads of sun loungers and volleyball court. You get a lovely breeze which is great but you need to make sure you are well lotioned, an alarming number of people get very burnt. There is also a bar / restaurant there so you don't need to go back to the hotel for lunch (included in the all inclusive). My only grumble about the hotel is that the walls in the blocks where the rooms are are a little thin, if someone in your block has a 7am excursion and are inconsiderate then you may get woken up, this was hardly a problem for us though as we were up early most days anyway. For UK travellers I would say that I was not impressed with Thomson (whom we flew with). The plane was not the greatest with no \"in-seat\" TV's and terrible films (only one on the way out). Hopefully that is all helpful, if you fancy a night out whilst there then try and get to Coco Bongo's in Cancun, an amazing place with a spectacular show, we were there 5 1/2 hours and it felt like little more than an hour.", "Date": "September 22, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Widnes,England", "Title": "\u201ci loved this place!!\u201d", "Author": "emma_lou11", "ReviewID": "UR5800744", "Content": "i went to the riu tequila with my friend and her family.. as it was my first time in mexico i didnt know what to expect.. when i arrived at the riu tequila... i absolutely loved the place! it was a beautiful place to be! when you are in the riu everything you need is at hand... you never need to be worried about anything everyone is so helpful and it is a really enjoyable place to be! the entertainers were the best part to the holiday.. treated everyone really well...

Upon arrival, we loved this hotel. The friendly staff greeted us with much needed welcome drinks and took our luggage to our room. The hotel rooms are very spacious and very clean. We looked at this site prior to booking our holiday and noticed many people seemed to complain that the rooms smelt musty - we did not have this problem. I must emphasise though how clean the room was. Our fridge was always well stocked and we always had plenty of clean towels. If you need anything extra, then you just have to let the reception know and you'll have it in your room straight away. The staff at the hotel were fantastic. Always very friendly and working extremely hard. The food at the hotel was great, particularly the breakfast! This was the only holiday we had ever been on where we actually made the effort to get up for breakfast every morning. Lunch was mainly served at the pool bar area. The food was mostly similar each evening, but there is so much food laid out that you could easily have something different every night, plus there is the 2 speciality restaurants also - the Steakhouse and the Seafood restaurant. We tried the steakhouse, which was really good, but if you like your steaks well done, then ask to have it very well done as they tend to make them medium or rare. There are plenty of bar areas - it is very easy to get served. There are also self service pumps for beer and wine as well as for soft drinks. A little tip when you're going to Mexico is to leave buying any sun lotions till you get there. The sun is very fierce and the lotions you can buy over there tend to be more suited to the climate. The same applies with insect repellent - you will need this at night! The beach is gorgeous and only a 5 minute walk from the hotel entrance down a lovely walkway - there is a golf buggy available to taxi hotel guests, but we liked the walk. Something worth noting though - the beach does not have a lot of shade available as many of the palm trees were destroyed in recent hurricanes, so it's advisable to take something that will provide shade like a parasol etc. You should be able to pick one up either at the hotel or at the nearby shops. Apart from that, the country is amazing, and we had a great time with only one real complaint; we were only there for a week! We will definitely be back at the Riu Tequila.", "Date": "September 11, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "England, UK", "Title": "\u201cThe good the bad and the ugly!\u201d", "Author": "BeccaP23", "ReviewID": "UR5776905", "Content": "I stayed at the Riu Tequila for two weeks in a party of 6 at the end of August (Age ranges 20 to 53). Starting with the good things about the hotel; the beach has to be number one, it is just fabulous - the sea is so clear with loads of fish and the beach itself is lovely, very clean and easy to get a sun bed. The bars are also near, and you can get dishes of nachos with cheese sauce which were always a favourite! The non-motorised water sports were also excellent, there was always one of us doing something! The pool areas in the hotel were ok, a bit crowded and was always tricky to find a sunbed, so we tended to head for the beach. The meals in the hotel were average, definitely not 4 or 5 * quality. The same dishes were served every night and if you look at the menu at the front door it is never the same as the actual food!! Breakfast was without doubt the best meal of the day so make sure you eat well there! The mexican and steak house a la carte restaurants did offer a change, but were not of the standard you would expect of a restaurant in England. Make sure you take plenty of anti-diarrhoea tablets, all 6 of us suffered for at least a week of the holiday. We aren't sure if this was a bug, the food or the ice in the drinks but we definitely weren't the only ones suffering. The bedrooms were large but quite basic and smelt very musty due to the high humidity. The entertainment team had plenty of enthusiasm, and some of the evening shows were quite good, but the majority were quite painful to watch.. wait to see how long it takes for the presenter guy in the evening to annoy the hell out of you!! By far and away the worst part of the holiday was the theft that occured in two of our three rooms. The first item to be stolen was a mobile phone (which was normally in the safe but had been accidently left out) the phone was stolen along with the charger which had been found by the thief looking through all the drawers in the room, which was obvious on return to the room. The second item to be stolen from a different room on a totally separate occasion was an item of clothing - not a nice feeling at all to think someone has been through your clothes. I cannot emphasise enough the importance of putting everything you think of as valuable in the hotel safe, which is very small.

We had been to the Riu Lupita the previous year and enjoyed it very much - the Lupita was a smaller resort but the staff were super friendly the food was the best and the rooms were great.... but this year we wanted to try another Riu and a 5 start instead of a 4 star. So if you don't mind a shuttle ride to the beach the RIU LUPITA is strongly recommended. i'll try and break this down for you RIU TEQUILLA: a bigger resort than what we are used to so it took us a while to get acustomed to the layout and to find our room. The only negative thing was the other couple, on their honeymoon, never got their upgrade or gift basket. THE ROOMS were perfect. we had a great bed, nice view of the sunrise everymorning too. The only thing with these rooms is that teh drain in the bathroom doesn't drain very fast. That's the only thing i'd have to say. otherwise they were comfortable.and the room service was great.you have a mini bar - stocked every other day (corona,pop,water) and 4 dispensers of gin,tequila,rum,vodka..... GROUNDS: jungle like, i prefer this to cancun!!! well kept, colorful and beautiful architecture. STAFF: the staff were great - very helpful but with this being a bigger resort i found we didn't get to know them as much as we did at the Lupita - the night shows were awesome - they do put on a childrens show first then around 10PM is the real show - they also have a 24 hour sports bar serving drinks - snacks next to the theater and a dance bar (never went seemed a lot of young kids were there) go to town to go out dancing :) FOOD: the buffet is huge!!! the breakfast was my favorite everyday - great coffee, egss were the best. Lunch we ate at the grill down at the RIU YUcatan where the beach is (because you can eat at yucatan or playacar for lunch and they are right on the beach.dinner the buffet was great - always changing at night with a few of the same ol favorites - but the a la cartes were worth the wait in line in the morning to sign up - the best being the steakhouse. the seafood on eis down at the yucatan RIU at the beach house - very nice/quiet BUT bring mosquito repellent as they are fierce down their at night by the beach. WARNING: you are going to mexico and there is a chance you may get montezuma's revenge - diarrhea/food poisoning. I did get this but ONLY because i chanced it and ate off the resort at Xel-ha. make sure you keep yourself hydrated- read up about it on the web here's a great link [--] DAY TRIPS: Playa Del Carmen is a must - $5.00 cab ride one way from resort. lots of walking - 5th ave is fun we went there 5 times during our week - we went out one night for drinks and went to a few bars for dancing - the Mariachis bands playing in the resurants and on the streets are great. the playa mart is a great place if you are looking for souviners at a good price. we did eat the food in town and had no problems. watch out for time share guys - just say no gracias - i would highly recommend doing an excursion - best snorkling is at XEL-HA ( we went there last year and this year) [--] they have a great day option for snorkling and to go to Tulum ruins. If you go to Xel Ha just for the day pay a little extra and get the all included package - it is worth it - we ate lunch there (no problem) but it was our fault to eat at 6pm when the park was closing must of been the last of teh meat from the day - we should have went back to resort for dinner. please note you need bio-digradble sunblock for this park. NOTE: if you can stand the heat then visiting the ruins either in tulum,chichen Nitza or coba are for you - it can get really hot away from the coastline - bring lots of water.best ruins (as i have been to all of the above) are chichen Nitza for grandeur and size, and Tulum for the view of the ocean and beach. the other park that we haven't had a chance to visit yet is Xcaret. I;ve read up a lot about it and the dinner show/ball game looks great. [--] can't go wrong with the RIU's - just remember if you like to be waited on go to the smaller RIU's like Lupita - if you like a bigger resort try Yucatan/tequilla - i've never been to the palace or mayan riveria Riu but they look like palaces - have fun :)", "Date": "September 2, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cumbria", "Title": "\u201cfantastic!\u201d", "Author": "xXxaimeexXx", "ReviewID": "UR5726864", "Content": "i have just read all these comments and have been gobsmakced! i dont know how any one could think this hotel was anything but the best! me and my family of 6 booked into the riu tequila looking for fun! and this is exactly what we got! the rooms were cleaned everyday with towels left in the shape of animals! you got a mini bar in your room and at the end of the phone was some one willing to come on fill it when ever you wanted more of anything! the pool was amazing you choose your pool quiet or a little more lively! the lively pool you get games such as water polo volleyball or aeroboics whatever you fancy you can do...the other side you get a pool bar with very friendly staff who will get you what ever you want at the click of a finger. and then you can sit and relax in the pool with no noise! then the entertainment carries on well into the night with shows everynight to fit any taste!...children have mini club and then shows such as grease a comedy show a magic show and the adults will also enjoy these...then theres the shows with professional dancers from around the world. when this is over there is a place where the adults can go with no children and dance the night away...while the older children can go and have a game of pool in the cool sports bar...the choice is endless and the entertainment staff make all these things even more fun! excursions are there when ever you want to take them and the staff organise these very well! the food in the hotel is fantastic...with the theme changing everynight from asian to carriabean! then the children get the usual chips and hotdogs or burgers or pizza! something to satisfy everyone! i am some one who likes to move round then world and try new places but this is one place that i could go back to again and again no problem!! i dont have one bad thing to say about this place! everything was perfect and was made perfect for your holiday! whatever you want you can have it....you like beaches there is a buggy to the beach which takes 2 minutes and if your a pool person its open all day with free drinks and food when ever you want it! this is a hotel that has taken my breath away with things you can do and i would definately go back!!", "Date": "August 30, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cVery nice\u201d", "Author": "nancy1099", "ReviewID": "UR5726157", "Content": "Just got back today.

From the food, the hotel, the people, the weather, the rooms everything was spot on. After reading a few dodgy reports b4 we left i was a little bit worried but please let me tell u this hotel is just great. We arrived (after a 12 hour delay UK end) to a welcomed drink and the check in was the quickest ever. Our room key (Room 1001) was ready on a greeting desk with our towel cards, welcome pack and hotel safe key. The bell boys took our cases to our rooms for us and we tipped them for this as the rooms are quite a walk away and at 1am we really this was a job we were soo grateful for. Rooms..... Our room 1001 was a ground floor room which was immaculate and stayed immaculate for our 2 weeks as the maids (some of the maids are men) cleaned our rooms every day and provided us with clean towels and they even folded my nightdress and placed it neatly on my pillow every day bless them. The maids would also make animals out of towels (see pic) and they do a demonstration of this around the pool one afternoon - very clever. The optics in the room consist of vodka, brandy, whisky and tequila and the fridge consists of orange fanta, pepsi, sprite, water and corona lager. The fridge was topped up constantly and we never ever went dry. It is worth noting that there are no baths in the hotel - there is a huge shower which is quite powerful. There are two queen sized beds and my son who is 17 had a put up bed at the side of ours which he said was cosy and even with this bed in our room there was still lots of space. the TV channels are OK mainly spanish but you did get BBC world news (for us in UK) and there was one film channel in english. But who wants to watch tv anyway. Behind the rooms in the grassed areas you will find lots of little animals but they do not bother you and are frightened and timid. There were little racoon animals but i am not sure what the correct name for them is. Also there were a few large guinea pig like animals. also some iguanas. please note tho that they are more scared of us then we them. FOOD..... Awesome, it has to be one of the best hotels we have stayed in for choice (We have been to the moon palace in cancun which is highly rated for their food) and this hotel was just as good if not better. Breakfast was a huge selection every morning and set u up for the day. this opens at 7am and shuts at 1030am. The choice u get for evening meal is huge. the evening meal opens at 630 - 10pm. Every night it was a dilema what to have - they cater for all tastes, pasta, meats, fish, vegetarian, mexican, fries and deserts just mmm with lots of different flavour ice creams and they also made fresh donuts and pancakes in front of you. The childrens were catered for too with a childrens section - the staff in the restaurant were so helpful and nothing too much trouble. We did go down to the Yucatan in the day while we were on the beach and we must say that the food at the Tequila is better. A lot of people were saying the same while we were there. We did book the steakhouse three times during our fortnight and it was a nice break -here the menu is set and u have a starter consisting of chicken wings, onion rings and courgettes in batter with a dip, a salad accompanying it then soup then u get the choice of either steak, ribs, chicken or pork u can have with fries or jacket pot. there are two sittings for the steak house one at 7 and the other at 9pm. There is also snacks to be had in the sports bar which was pizza and burgers, they provide a microwave for u to warm them yourselves - proved popular with the youngsters. ENTERTAINMENT.... This by far was the best we have seen in the Caribbean. The animacion team work exceptionally hard they work from 11am to 11pm every day. they are soo nice and friendly and we got to know them all and had lots of fun with them. Denisse is sooo lovely and we became close friends. there are competitions to join in throughout the day like french boules, darts, shufle board, table tennis, rifle shooting. There is aerobics in the pool every morning and stretching session. they have a break and resume at 3 with activities and bingo at 430 every day. If u win anything it is up on the stage at 945 pm that same night to collect your certificate and Riu Tequila sun visor We won about 4 during our stay and we met lots of lovely people during the daily competitions. the shows in the evening were great - the ones the animacion team do were great - fantastic dancers and they get u up to have a little salsa. no pressure. the show from grease was great and they also had a magician one nite and some mayan dancers and michael jackson show another nite was crazy nite with funny sketches. compared to other caribbean hotels this is definately the most varied and entertaining program by far. There is a disco in the hotel and we did not see our son for the two weeks - he met lots of friends and partied all nite. The disco was very dark however but i did go in a few times - the music was great - the age group was from 18 - under 30. quite young! this disco opens after the entertainment ends at 11pm shuts at 3am. EXCURSIONS..... We did just two excursion - the captain hook pirate nite was a really good family nite out and we laughed all nite - we were on the red ship and we won!! they have a lovely meal on board fun and games and a battle and to end the night a disco. great nite wud recommend this. the second excursion we did was the dolphin encounter - great a must they are such lovely animals. i was so glad i did it. my husband and son went to play golf a few times there. the golf course is walking distance to the hotel. it was however a bit pricey at 180$ a game per person or aged 17 and under 120$. My son is 17 so lucky there. SHOPPING..... Outside the hotel and turn left 2 mins walk there is a little precinct of shops selling souvenirs etc . there is also a bureau which exchanges money here. also the telephones are here u can get the phonecards from here- much cheaper to phone from down here as the hotel was charging 5$ connection charge to the UK! PLAYA DEL CARMEN My husband and i went down to 5th Avenue twice during our stay. it costs a set 5$ and takes 5 mins. It was really nice to get a mexican feel lots of shops, silver shops and some designer shops. (also a macdonalds!) WEATHER... was bad for the first few days and then on the 4th day the sun shone and continued to do so for the rest of our stay, we stayed 1st - 15th aug but this is hurrican season so be warned. BEACH.... i nearly forgot this one... the beach is lovely and clean but please be warned no shade here - we placed a sunbed on a sunbed to hide the sun off the little one that was with us. most people were doing the same. the sunbeds are free and u can use yur towel from the hotel to take to the beach. There were some little fish in the sea but if u took some bread with you and started to throw it about all of a sudden u will see millions of fish ha! there are non motorised sports on the beach banana boat splash cats etc the usual. The beach is right on the grounds of the Yucatan so you use this hotel for the drinks and food. The walk from the Tequila to the Yucatan is a 5 min walk but in the heat and with small children you can jump on the golf buggy which picks u up right on the steps on the Tequila. its just across the non busy road up a little walkway (see pic) and you are there. No prob and nothing to moan about for those that do! during our holiday we met lovely people from all over the world and we have lovely memories. Actually we met a great family from London and this weekend they came to visit us in Wales and we have had a ball. cant wait to go to london next. Honestly if u are considering booking this hotel u cant go wrong - we are even considering returning back next summer something we have never done in the past. On the day we came home a few of the animacion team came to wave us off and must admit there were a few tears. We are missing them and i especially miss Denisse as we hit it off and she became my adopted daughter.... I gave her my perfume before we left and she was soooo thrilled and grateful. My son who is 17 had a great holiday and on flight home he told me it was the best he has had - what more can i say. if u wish to mail me and i will answer any questions - shalb@hotmail.com.

The Tequila is quite nice; very nice rooms and generally pleasant atmoshpere. I liked the big central lobby and the people are friendly. Entertainment was ok and so was the food. The only real complaint was how eating at the central buffet would make your clothes smell of food. The other Riu resorts (all within walking distance) may have different looks but are very similar to the Tequila in terms of quality. It is not until moving into the Palace that we noticed the differences. The rooms are just a bit bigger, the food just a bit better. But given how much less expensive the Tequila is, its definitely the better deal. One particular, overall complaint is the prices charged for a good massage. I love taking massages when on vacation but the various treatments given at the Riu complex (same prices in all hotels) range between USD 85 and USD 110. That's more than twice as much as I pay back home, and to be honest it felt a bit like a rip-off. Luckily, another guest gave us a golden tip I would like to pass on. For those like me who like a frequent massage, take a taxi to Avenida 5. Between streets 10 and 12 you will find a spa called 'Veronica's'. It's not really a spa in the sense that it takes a basic approach and offers nothing (e.g. jacuzzi, sauna, etc) except for the very, very best massages around. And for prices ranging between 30 and 40 USD, with staff speaking various languages. It is really an incredible deal, and me and my husband ended up going almost every day the last part of our vacation.

I'm more of a motel 6 kind of person who is more interested in the place that I'm going, than the place I'm sleeping. So this was a new experience for my family. We could not have been happier with this hotel. For those who complain of ants and insects, keep in mind - you are in a tropical environment. Without hermeticaly sealing your room, there is no possible way for any hotel to keep out every bug. We did experience ants in our room here and there but did not have an issue with it. Once we found a spider and my fiance squished it, this enticed a whole squadrant of ants. So do be forwarned, do not leave ANYTHING edible outside of your fridge. There really is no reason to horde food anyway as food and drink is available 24/7. For those of you who are not into the hard liquer; my fiance hit up the drink cart every few days and was easily able to get a case of beer for a $5 tip. Otherwise, you only get about 2 beers a day in your fridge. Of course you can always go out to the bar and get one, but we had kids with us. I was most hesitant about the buffet. But it was good and varied enough that we never even bothered making reservations for the nicer diners. I was very happy with the quality of food. The juices are a little weak so take advantage of the orange juice at breakfast, it's fantastic. Only my youngest participated in the kids club (she's 6). She had a great time and it gave us time to go play some of the games for adults. I don't recommend leaving the hotel though. They are great with the kids but it is loosely fashioned and certainly NOT a babysitting service. The pools and the beach were fantastic and the servers are VERY accomidating. The kids loved swimming up to the bar and ordering their own drinks. They could order a virgin strawberry daqurie and the staff would not hesitate to blend them up a fresh one. If you have water-babies, this is the hotel for you. Our entire stay, we bought ONE meal. Everything else was at the hotel or included in a tour. It made it very easy to stay within our budget. All except our Cozumel tour either picked us up at the hotel lobby or at Playacar which is a shopping plaza less than two minutes away. If you are comming from the states; however, accept that your children will get a worldly education. There are MANY european tourists who lay out topless, we saw a nude beach on one of our snorkeling trips, and the first night there they got to see what it looks like when someone is REALLY drunk - hence the \"stagering drunk\" definition. But despite the fact that alcahol is available 24 hours a day, that was the only completely out of control person we saw. If you plan to come to the Mayan Riviera, do it soon.

We brought my parents, my sister's family of 4 and also my brother's family of 5 with us. 1. Our room had a severe flying ant problem so when we complained about it, all they did was supply us with a can of Raid. 2. We were told that if an upgraded room was available, we would be able to upgrade with no extra charge but this wasn't true at all. Since my brother has 3 children, he asked if a junior suite was available. When the front desk said \"yes but you'll have to pay $100.00 a day\", my brother reminded them of their free upgrade policy so after fussing with the computer for some time, they said the room was no longer available and that all junior suites were booked. 3. My sister's daughter had an accident in her bed at night so she called the front desk to ask for some clean sheets but front desk said there was no one around to help out. My niece and sister had to sleep either in dirty sheets or on the floor.

It was our honeymoon and we are so glad we booked the Tequila . On arrival we were greeted with fresh juice and our cases taken straight to our room, no hanging around waiting to check-in. Rooms The room was spotless, the cleaners work so hard. Everyday we came back to a different animal on our bed and the fridge was stocked everyday to. Just what you needed a cold drink after a hard day sunbathing!! Yes the decor is quite basic but authentic and cleaner than some top hotels in London. Pool We always found a lounger with shade. The pool area was nice and looked great at night all lit up. Workers were always busy clearing empty glasses etc away. Beach Great beach, quite busy and not much shade though. We tended to go down later for a walk and swim once the sun had gone down alittle as the pool was just so handy to jump into! And the walk to the beach is not even worth mentioning! it makes a nice change to sitting around all day! Food Wonderful food, it was hard to know where to start and what to choose. All the dishes we really tasty. We went to the steak house twice and the seafood restaurant twice. Both had great food but we did find the service at the Mediterian not that great e.g starters would come out even before everybody is sat down and drinks have been poured (this is prob my only complaint). Still worth going though for a change. The weather was really good, whilst we were there we had a day and a half of rain, but it was that hot the rest of the time a couple of days out of the sun was quite welcomed. Even when it was alittle cloudy it was still in the high 80's. Playa del Carmen is definalty worth a trip, some good shops and nice atmosphere. It is larger than I expected too. The shop owners do try and get you in, but just a nice no is all it takes. This did not bother us at all as they are only trying to make a living. All part of the experience of going to different places. We did the Dolphin plantium trip-FANTASTIC, well worth the money. The dolphins are brillaint, such a good feeling and brilliant experience. The trip over to the island is lovely. the afternoon activities are just as much fun, go round the island on a golf buggy and time for some shopping. We also did the Tulum and Xel Ha day trip, again this was great. We thoroughly enjoyed both trips and would defo recommend them. Nicest staff ever, clean, hot, plenty to see and do, good atmosphere, great food and lots of corona. Overall super holiday.

We stayed there July 15-22. The whole trip was amazing!! We booked our trip through a travel agency, which suggested this hotel. (We originally were Cancun bound until we saw their beaches.) The Riviera Maya def. did not get hit as hard from last year's hurricane. Even talking to the locals, we were told that they are getting all the Cancun people this year. ARRIVAL: We arrived at the hotel to be surprised at the beauty of the lobby. Everything is all open with couches and a huge fountain in the middle. The front desk staff was very friendly. No problems finding our reservations and even offered us a drink while they were getting all of our information. I did not think we were going to be able to check in until 3 pm. We arrived around 12 and there was no hesitation. One staff member took our luggage and led us the way to our room. We stayed right across from the pool area, which is pretty much the center of all rooms. ROOM: Our room was decent, not lavish or anything but extremely clean and well kept. There were 2 beds pushed together (European-style), a balcony, tv, dresser, table/chairs, and bathroom. The toilet has a separate door so someone can be in the shower or at the sink sep. There were animal creations out of towels on our bed. We did tip the maid every once in a while and she would make the animals and put flowers all over our beds and in the room. We did NOT use the security safe in our bedroom because we found it hard to lock and get open. However, I had a combination lock on my luggage in which we kept our valuables. (Well being a girl I pretty much kept everything in there..lol) There is also a mini bar with gin, vodka, tequila, and rum, which is included. There is a mini fridge with sodas, coronas, and water. This is restocked every other day, but you get bottled water every day. All included. POOL: The pool was spectacular. It pretty much has two sides with the lunch place in the middle. It has tiki huts surrounding the sides with chairs everywhere. There are tiled lounge chairs in the pool also for sunbathing. The pool is cool in the morning, but does warm up towards the end of the day. It also does tend to become a bit dirty towards the end, but we ALWAYS saw a staff member with nets cleaning it throughout the day. HIGHLY RECOMMEND the pool bar!! It was great. The bartenders (Cruz,Roberto,David) were so friendly. When you were almost finished with your last drink, they were already asking you what you wanted next. (Which is pretty much how this is at every bar here, surprisingly) I don't think we ever waited more than a minute for a drink. Some people took large mugs to drink, which they would fill for you. But getting a drink was not a problem and I like to try new stuff. I suggest the tequila slammer shot. It is fun to watch them make them too! FOOD: I was REALLY surprised with how well the food is here. I am a extremely picky eater. I barely eat any meat at all and I found the selection to be great. They cater to every culture. Breakfast and dinner are served in a room located in the lobby. For breakfast there was everything and anything. Eggs, bacon, sausage, pancakes, French toast. They also had a meat/cheese bar with rolls. The made-fresh smoothie bar was also great!! Dinner was great too. Salad bar, all different types of meat, veggies, soups, rolls, and things for children too (hotdogs, chicken fingers, fries, spaghetti, pizza, etc) Lunch is by the pool. They had a good selection also, but I loved the pizza. We ate it once a day!! There are 2 restaurants. Steak house (lunch area in the evening) and Mediterranean place in the Yucatan across the road. We ate at the steak house 2 times because it was very good. We got salads, fried foods (fried zuch, mushrooms, chicken wings), soup, main meat with corn, veggies, roll, and an Alaskan dessert. You can eat breakfast, lunch at any of the other 2 hotels (playacar and yucatan) not dinner excluding the med. place. It is all pretty much the same anyways. BEACH: The beach was great. Although we preferred the pool. There is not much shade at the beach due to the ruining of the trees so you will fry! Chairs are available. Just make sure you get your towels at the hotel you stay at. The walk (or shall I say golf cart ride, since we didn't walk at all) is NOT BAD!!! Don't worry, it's a nice shady stroll and you can work off all the buffet food!! It also greatly reduces the price of this hotel. Be aware there are many topless ladies and guys in speedos..haha. It didn't bother neither of us though, quite comical at times. ENTERTAINMENT: We went to about 4 or so shows. They were great. I mean we are not talking Broadway here and to anyone that says they are bad, well I suggest you go and watch these young adults practice during the day (which you can watch and we did). They work their butts off and we really enjoyed it. It was a nice end to the evening after dinner. They also have a kids time thing before each show which the kids come up to the stage and perform stuff. Aslo cute to watch. We went the mini-disco type club thing once. Not really my thing cause they played techno sort of music that night. There is also a sports bar which has sports tvs, internet, pool tables, video games, air hockey, bar, etc. Nice and cool also. EXCURSIONS: We booked our excursions through FUNJET or LOOMAS TRAVEL. We chose to do a double one which included mini speed boating and ATV riding. We loved it. It was $106 all together and you do both for 45 min each. They also provide shuttles to the marina (20 min away). I would also suggest Parasailing. We wanted to do that also, but didn't get around to it. The people that did it loved it. The parasailing people will scope you out on the beach if you want to do it, but they don't harass you or anything. All non-motor sports included: paddleboats, kayaks, boogie boards. PEOPLE: We were surprised about the fact that it was hard to find very many American people here. We found alot of people from England, Germany, and Poland. Which didn't bother us, since we like talking to everyone. In fact, we found a great English group and hung out with them occasionally. STAFF: The staff was great. Always smiling and saying Ola, cleaning, maintenance, keeping your drinks filled, pulling out your chairs, everything. We did tip the pool bartenders at the end of our stay since we got to know them so well. We also tipped our server at the restaurants, but nowhere else really. It is really up to you, although we didn't see too many tippers. Our trip was amazing. A great deal and I would def. recommend it to anyone. When asked the downsides, I truly cannot think of any. I am younger though, and pretty easy going but I still think it is worth the money!! Sorry this was so long, but this site really helped me chose this hotel and I would want to know everything before I went.

When we booked we were told that the hotel was rated 4 star, After being there for two weeks and experiencing it for myself i truly beleive it deserves the extra star! When we arrived it was fairly late in the afternoon and after a long journey we where welcomed by extremely friendly staff who straight away gave us our room keys and our bags where then taken by porters to our room, this then left us able to get our barings and enjoy the gorgeous drink that was given to us as soon as we arrived! My first impressions of the hotel where of how grand it all looked, if you have seen any pics on here, it really does look exactly that and more. The hotel grounds where extremely well kept and every day you would see gardeners hard at work maintaining the beautifull plants and things that where around. I would also like to say that i have never ever been to a hotel that is so clean! there was never a thing out of place anywhere and throughout my stay i could never once find anything to point out and say, i really dont like the look of that. There where always cleaners popping in and out of the toilets, by the pool, in the main reception/lounge area. The staff where all nice, extremely helpfull. They never bothered or hassled you in anyway but where always there for anything you could have wanted, if there was something that you wanted they would go out of there way to get it for you. And if any of the staff ever passed you they would always greet you with a smile and a hello. I dont get why people are complaining on here about the walk to the beach!!!!! i hate walking in the heat and would not have liked the 5 minute walk to the beach but that is only because i am lazy! But i went to the beach afew times and they have made provisions for lazy people like me! there is a golf buggy that arrives ever 5 to 10 minutes that picks you up from reception and takes you STRAIGHT TO THE BEACH! the journey takes about 2 minutes! I didnt watch many shows because i was always to tierd but the ones i did watch where great and you could see alot of hard work had gone into them. The shows that where on where listed every day, a day in advance in the reception area. The two weeks that we where there only one show was repeated. The food was great, i am an amazingly fussy and plain eater and had almost something different every day i was there, there is a huge choice of food, even for people who are more daring than me! And you can clearly see that in the buffet restaraunts it is all cooked professionaly and in a really clean enviroment, they cook most things infront of you to your requirements. Oh and i would just like to say that those animals that they made out of towels where amazing!!! they left a different one on our bed every day and i had a huge collection by the end of our stay as i wouldnt let them take them apart, they had to keep using more towels to make me new ones! ok there wasnt many but here are my downsides to the place.... I really dont like animals of any kind that are not domestic pets! Unfortunately i found the amazing surroundings to attract the more exotic animals! there where huge iguanas and baby lizzards by the pool area, not all the time, but enough to make me run every once in a while! there where also raccoons, quite alot of them actually! you never ever saw them by pool or food areas but often alot of them by the hotel rooms in the late afternoons. They where often joined by an animal that i cant really put a name to! i can only describe it as some sort of hare, but with no tail and not quite as attractive! They all seemed to be pretty harmless and never harmed you in anyway, but never the less a huge iguana under my sunbed did not do it for me! There also seemed to be a problem with birds during the day in the pool bar where the lunch buffet was served. They where attracted to food left on peoples tables and would be straight there as soon as people left there table taking the food. This isnt great if you are sitting next to that table and they scare the life out of you like they did me! However i must say the bird problem is not one of the hotel, as staff where there really quite quick to take away leftovers and clean the tables and you could see that they where working extremely hard to do the best they could. There is also loads of mosquitos and huge moths at night time, so take your repellent! Also there are no umbrellas on the beach! when we went it was so very hot and with nowhere at all to shade on the beach apart from going in the bar, I got really sunburnt in twenty minutes with lots of factor 30 suncream on! We where told though that there used to be lots of trees on the beach that where really good to shade under, but sadly where all lost due to the hurricane, they where aware it was a problem and im sure in due time they will rectify the problem. The last thing is that although all the buffet restaraunts where really clean and food was always great and cooked to a hight standard, i found the steak house to be slightly different. We made our reservations and went along to give it a go, but we did not go again after that. I ordered my steak well done and because of the poor lighting in there could not see what i was eating as we had one candle to light a table of 4 people. towards the end of my meal i held the candle up to see what it actually was i was eating and found my steak to be really rare and oozing with blood. Needless to say i didnt eat the rest of my meal and was quite ill the following day. I never made a complaint about this, but i did speak to someody that had because he was ill for a week after having eaten in there. He was give either an extra week onto his holiday or a free week to take when he liked. The staff where very cooperative and apologetic.

Our room was very clean and had no musty smell whatsoever like other reviewers have suggested. The grounds were immaculate and beautiful and the staff could not have been more friendly or helpful. The refridgerator in our room was stocked with water, Corona andsoft drinks. We are BIG water drinkers and when we left a note requesting more water in our room one of the housekeeping staff tracked us down on our way to the pool and asked how much we wanted. Then they kept us supplied with plenty after that. Being my first trip to Mexico I was a little nervous about the food so I took some Pepto Bismal before I ate my first meal. But after that I never took anything else and never once the entire time did I feel the least bit sick. The buffet was plentiful and I tried things I had never had or even heard of before. Food is available 24 hours a day whether in the restaurants or in the sports bar where you can throw something in the microwave. At the swim-up bar Victor and David did a great job taking care of our \"thirst\". After the first day as soon as we got in the water and headed that way they would greet us with our drinks and a big smile. They were awesome. The beach across the street at the other Riu hotels was incredibly beautiful. There were plenty of loungers available and lots of activities if you wanted to do more than soak up the sun. But be warned....if you are from the States and were raised in the bible belt (like us) the topless sunbathing by many of the women takes a little getting use to. They even come shower off by the pool wearing only a bikini bottom. Be smart and USE SUNCREEEN. We saw a lot of people that looked like lobsters because they were so sunburned. The disco at the Riu was small and filled with mostly younger people but age didn't seem to matter. They were from all over the world and very friendly. A young man from Germany,at LEAST 20 years younger than us, came and grabbed our hands and pulled us out on the dancefloor. Everyone had a great time. If you want to get some of the \"local flavor\" I suggest going into town to the Mambo Cafe. It's a large Salsa club a block off of 5th avenue (the shopping area) and it is something to be experienced. It doesn't look like much until you get past the cover desk but once inside I felt like I was on the set of an old 1960s \"rat pack\" movie (Las Vegas night clubs). The band doesn't even start until midnight but they were amazing! They play a lot of American music and videos as well as Latin music until then. We watched everyone doing their moves on the floor and even ended up being taught some steps by a couple of the locals. We had a GREAT time there. A taxi was right outside when we were ready to go back to our hotel (at 2:45 a.m.) and we felt totally safe even though we were two women in a foreign city and it was the middle of the night. We tried the Blue Parrot as others had suggested but it wasn't near the fun the Mambo was. There are a lot of things to do at the hotel but this trip was all about relaxation for us and it fit my expectations to a tee. All in all, the trip was everything I expected and more and I can't say enough about the wonderful staff at the Tequila. We can't wait to go back.

The food was amazing. We don't drink alcohol, so we required the food to be top notch at any resort we chose. Based upon the Trip Advisor reviews, we chose the Riu Tequila. Although not a strict vegetarian, I eat fish, seafood, and eggs. I don't eat any other kind of meat whatsoever. I was in heaven. There were so many choices that I had to stop myself at each meal. The rest of my family does eat meat and they raved about everything. The staff was incredibly friendly, just as at other resorts we have been to. We've never encountered anything but warm hospitality in Mexico. The Animacion Staff was FANTASTIC! Sergio and Rene and Richie and everyone were great fun, so very talented, and always smiling and making us laugh. Many of them know you by name! The grounds were impeccable. We never saw trash, empty plates and cups never piled up and the bathrooms seemed to have an attendant almost all of the time. The rooms were very clean and the only negative thing we might say is that, like many other reviews we read, the beds are very hard. No worries, though, we hopped in a $6 cab ride to Wal Mart and bought a foam pad. Problem solved. The beach is a nice walk (yes, kind of longish) but having stayed at other \"mega-resorts\" that were beachfront, your room could be the same distance from the beach as the walk from the Riu Tequila was. The golf cart/shuttle ran constantly except between 1-3pm. Siesta? Also, and very important to us, we felt completely comfortable leaving room keys, cameras, watches, etc. at our poolside table or on chairs on the beach without ever worrying of theft. And oh, the beach! There were no high rises visible. The tallest building we could see was 4 stories. And the water in the pictures? No, it's not touched up, it really is that color! Breathtaking! Until Wednesday or so, we seemed to be one of only 3 or 4 American families there. Everyone else was from everywhere else. This, to us, was terrific. We were able to meet people from all over the world and didn't hear any of the sometimes \"whiney\" American attitudes. All were terrific to us, as we weren't so sure given our place on the international stage right now.

The rooms weren't immaculate but they were kept spotless by the room service and fully stocked with beverages when we ran low. The grounds are beautiful and the staff was always happy and ready to serve us. There are two large pools surrounding a restaurant \"Lupita\" which is where we ate lunch everyday. Great food, even for picky eaters. Fries, pizza, chicken, nachos, fresh friut, very American, which is always good. We never got to make resrvations for the Steak house restaurant, only out of pure laziness. We were highly satisfied with the dinner buffet every night. It had delicious food and a great variety. We definitely gained about 5 pounds each. Weather was very hot and humid but we expected that going during the hottest month of the year. We only had one day out of seven where it was cloudy and rained on and off. The beach is only a 2 minute ride down a nice little enclosed pathway. The beach cart comes every 5 minutes. The beach is BEAUTIFUL. Perfect water, perfect sand. We went at about 9 am every morning and had no problems getting a chair but it does start to get crowded around noon. There is topless sun bathers for those of you that are bothered by that. You get used to it though. The only excursions we did was the ATV's through the jungle and it was a blast! I've never drove on one before but i learned pretty fast. It is VERY dusty so i recommend buying the bandanas they have for sale or bring one with you to cover your face.

Language was not a barrier. Everyone was very friendlyand helpful. Most of them spoke english. I would suggest taking lots of dollar bills. Tips are really appreciated.

We had a suite with love seats along with the infamous hard beds.....they are not fluffy for sure, but they are not \"un-sleepable\". Clean but musty just a ittle. There is slight smell, but the reviews warned us so we brought some febreeze. Everything you read here is quite accurate; you need lots of sunblock, mosquitoe repellent, at least 3 bikinis, and easy to dry clothes. the walk to the beach is about 5 minutes and is quite enjoyable...although at night there's a lot of mosquitoes!!! The beach is great. Set yourself down and swim and relax in the water....that was enough for us. We took advantage of the boogie boards (albeit old and used up) the kayaking etc. Join the animacion team in their daily event...it will be worth your memory....don't be shy - learn to dance, play volleyball, join in the water polo...Sergio, Renee Lupita etc are a fun and friendly bunch. We did not get sick. We also did look at the freshness of the raw food ie. fruit salad, creamy salads etc and opted not to eat any of them. Drinks were alright - stuck to Super conga and straight shots as we know they are not too fruity. Lunch is best at Lupita at Riu Tequila. Breakfast is also best at Tequila w/c is awesome b/c we didn't have to walk far. Yucatan was okay, but it was busy and the food seemed a little less pressentable. Yes, you need to book early in the morning for the speciality restaurants....7am is good enough. On the night of....request the seat that you really would prefer, otherwise, they will decide where to put you. The tours are extremely overpriced if you do the math. We rented a car at AVIS and drove to Tulum and Xel-Ha. Cheaper and at our leisure time. GOOD TIP: Xel-Ha will give you the choice to pay an entrance of all inclusive or not (pay as you go kinda thing). IF YOU OPT FOR ALL INCLUSIVE MAKE IT THERE FOR LUNCH SO YOU CAN EAT THERE. No sense paying for a meal at TULUM if you are going to pay an all inclusive at your next tour stop, right? (eat twice there and you will have gotten your entrance fee worth it already so...) TULUM is beautiful....especially the fantastic and humbling view of the water!!! All we are saying is get to Tulum early....9 and be on your way to Xel-Ha by 12 so you can get the full advantage of this water park.... Nothing is free; not the beer in the bus (chich is not all that cold), the guys outside the airport who wants to help you with your luggage is going to expect you pay them, sit on the right side of the bus if you don't want the sun for 1hour and half. The hotel is pretty. and the staff were an array of friendly to super friendly. Tipping got us mixed signals - it worked awesome for the room service yet no so well at the dining hall, I am not sure what we failed to understand. The hotel is a good hotel guys, nothing to worry about in terms of cleaniliness. Overall, if you want to see Mexico, you gotta get out out and be in Mexico. The mexican dishes mixed in the array of other food makes it hard to appreciate the culture - so if you are looking to experience Mexico - it is not thru all inclusive resorts...but if you are after a safe and relaxing time....join the animacion team...realx and de-stress. this is the way to go. e-mail if you have any comments or questions... oh...we did not take our Hep A shots - we found out too late. You are supposed to take it q week before your trip.

Here is a rundown of our wonderful vacation! We traveled in a group of 8 and stayed in 3 rooms. Airport-the arrival was a dream at the airport and the departure was nightmare!!!!! The airport is still operating with about 50% up and running, so everything is crammed into one section, however the 5 days of bliss out weighs the 2 hours of hectic chaos! Just be sure that you arrive 3 hours prior to your departure!!! Yes I said 3 hours! Transfers-We opted for private transfers with AGI tours, we emailed them to set up our transfers prior to our vacation they were a great price, and had excellent communication prior to our trip, they were there waiting with a card with our name on it even though we got in early, and the driver was safe and courteous, and they had a baby seat for our son already strapped in for him! The vans were very clean and the air conditioning worked great! The return was just as perfect with the driver arriving at our lobby just when we asked\u2026This is a great company from start to finish. Check-in and out was a breeze, the front desk staff speaks excellent English, they honored our emailed room request for my brothers special needs, and placed us in an excellent room closest to the pool and lobby! It took less then 5 minutes for check-in and less then 5 min for check-out. Grounds and buildings- The grounds are really beautiful, tons of tress, flowering bushes and plants. There are always workers out trimming, watering, etc. to keep everything looking very lush and tropical! There were also tons of little animals roaming the grounds that look like a mix of a raccoon, and a monkey! The buildings were in Spanish styling, with stucco exteriors, they were accented with arches and decorative Spanish tiles on the steps and the walls; the room numbers were hand painted tile. The doors are beautiful stained wood and have a very massive feel Rooms- Rooms were very clean, not very large, but honestly, we only use our room to sleep in. The rooms have 2 full beds pushed together we really liked the 1 \u201chuge\u201d bed, because our 2 year old stayed in bed with us! However, they can be separated if you don\u2019t want the affect of one giant bed. The rooms also have a small table and 2 chairs, a clock (this was a surprise as most places in the Caribbean don\u2019t have clocks!) My brothers had a rollaway bed in their room which was provide at no extra charge. We really liked the bathroom area, this housed the refrigerator, that is restocked with Corona, soda, water every other day, or if you run out in between days, simply call the front desk and they will send someone out. There was also the liquor dispenser; although we never used it (I prefer just getting my drinks at one of the many bars!) The sink in the bathroom is a nice size and granite. Off of the bath is a large shower\u2026with literally the STRONGEST water pressure that I have ever experienced. And a separate room for the toilet. There was also a large closet in the bath with extra blankets, the safe, and a large golf umbrella. The staff was great at bringing extra towel at your request! Off of the room was an average size balcony with 2 chairs and a small table as well as a handy clothing drying rack. Pool-There is a total of 3 pools, 2 that were very similar in shape and located on either side of the Lupita Restaurant. These were great, one being used for the activities and having a sloping area with a railing that made getting in and out of the pool for my brothers a breeze, it also providing a play are for our 2 year old. Both of the large pools also have a really neat area where the in pool loungers are, this was also a good area for our son to play as the water was only about 2\u2019 deep and it had a fountain in middle that he loved! There was also various other seating areas in both pools and one of the pools also has a small waterfall! The 3rd pool is a small children\u2019s pool, it only gets maybe 18\u2019-24\u2019. One really great thing about the lay out of this resort is that all the rooms are close to the pool! As the rooms are located in a circle with the pools being in the middle! One thing I guess that I should mention here is the topless sunbathing at the pool, you can always expect it on the beach but most resort do not allow it at the pools, however because of the large amounts European guests at this resort they do not enforce this! So there were topless women at the pools. Also, we were always able to get loungers by the pool, however if you have a certain spot that you want I suggest that you put towels out around 7am. But, there are always tons of chairs together open in the beach area. We never had a bug problem at the resort, and noticed that around 6:30am they misted the area around the pool\u2026I assume that they were misting some sort of bug spray. Beach-As I\u2019m sure you all know this property is located behind the other Riu\u2019s and use their beach. This was the first time that we have stayed somewhere that was not \u201cbeach front\u201d but, it was really not an issue for us, because we NEVER stay at high rise resorts, we opt for bungalow style resorts set in tropical environments, so we have always had some kind of a walk to the water. I even consider the walk as part of enjoyable things to do on our vacations! The beach was fairly busy during the day and very quiet in the early morning. The waves were quite ruff during our stay, but the water was absolutely beautiful! The only complaint that I might have is that the walkway to the beach does not open until 7am, and we like to go to the beach around 6am to 6:30am, this was not a huge deal however because we just walked through the Riu Palace to get there! The tram to the beach runs from 7am to 1pm and 3pm to 6:30pm, this could be a problem for people with a walking problem, because the Mediterranean restaurant is located at the end of the walkway/tram path, and the first seating is not until 7pm, this means that you will be able to get a ride down there, but you are on your own for the walk back! Because of this we did not get to try this restaurant during our stay. Food- I can not say enough good stuff about the food at the Tequila, it truly has been the best food that I have had at an all-inclusive! We ate at the steakhouse one night; they prepared a special table for our group since it was my parent\u2019s 39th wedding anniversary, and made a cake for them, decorated the table, and popped open 2 bottles of campaign\u2026a very nice touch! The buffets were so good that we just LOVED going to eat! I think I gained 5lbs! Breakfast at the main restaurant was really great, with omelet\u2019s, fresh fruit smoothies, and about everything else you can think of, the main restaurant was from 7am to10am and on Sunday they have a champion breakfast! Then at the Lupita continental breakfast from 10am till12pm. Lunch at the Lupita was great\u2026I love the guacamole, quesadillas, fajita\u2019s, they also had pasta, fruits, soups, hamburgers, hotdogs, nachos, etc. Dinner was superb! Buffets were beautiful with ice sculptures, cooking stations, and really delicious food. We have normally experienced at all inclusive\u2019s where all the food looks good, but tastes awful, but I am happy to say that it tastes as good as it looks! Service-the service at this resort is truly top notch! It has been the same as at other Riu\u2019s that we have stayed, they really have the best service! The bartenders were wonderful and very fast, the waiters were all very attentive, and everyone was extremely friendly. When you leave, you will feel like you are leaving your friends behind! Side Trips- the only thing that we really did this time around was shop at the little shopping area right next to the Tequila. It is expensive to shop there, and you will find things much cheaper in Playa Del Carmen, but if you are not planning on buying much you might as well save the taxi fare and just pay a little extra for your goods. But all of the shops have the same items so shop around; the stores at the back had cheaper prices! We also did Scuba Caribe ATV tour, it was a blast! We just did the 2 hour tour, we went into a cave and swam in a cenote (area of fresh water part of an underground river). My only disappointment was that my picture developing (in the US) was horrible, and the CD that they made was even worse! So, the pics that I have attached do not accurately represent the beauty of this resort!

Prior to going, we planned the trip based on all the feedback on TripAdvisor.com so felt it only right to share our experiences for others to review as well. I'll make this easy for you to read by breaking it down into the categories that mattered the most to use when we look for a place to vacation: 1) Cleanliness- The Riu Tequila grounds, rooms, and restaurants and extremely well-kept! There were always staff cleaning or repairing anything that needed a little attention. The exterior of the rooms are much more lavish than the rooms we stayed in, but they were clean, with everything in working condition. 2) Service- No complaints at all about the service we received. There were a few items we requested upon arrival that were delivered within minutes. The staff were very friendly and greeted everyone with a smile and a \"Buenas Dias\" or whatever was appropriate. The staff at the front desk were extremely helpful in taking care of business and answering just about any question I had about the area or the resort itself. 3) Food - Excellent variety of foods at the buffet and a beautiful setting to dine in. It was easy to find a table set with clean linens and no wait for someone to take your drink orders. Breakfast and supper were our two staple meals and the rest of the day was spent at the beach or doing activities. The food was warm and tasty, mixed enough so you could try local foods as well as stick to kid-friendly foods (read, pizza). Though there were a large number of people in the room, the flow of lines split by different specialty food areas made it seem like there were fewer people present. Rarely did you have to wait for anything and the Cappacino machines were a welcome in the morning and after dinner. 4) Activities - Tons of activities to choose from for all ages! We were there for the beach so most of our time was spent in the ocean (I don't think we ever swam in the pool at the Riu Tequila, though we did at one of the other Riu Resorts next to the beach). By evening, we were usually beat and just ready to crash in our rooms. We didn't do the shows or disco, so can't speak to them, though we did spend one night in the Sports Bar with the kids playing pool and foosball. 5) Beach - Even though you had to walk 5 minutes to the beach or take the golf cart if you wanted, it was a pleasant stroll under a shaded lane. The beach had Lots of chaise lounges to choose from and both shaded and sunny areas available. The beach was clean with very little trash from the previous day which showed they were cleaning it up at night. You had access to the Beach Cafe restaurant with another Riu Resort in case someone wanted a bite for lunch so you didn't have to give up your spot on the beach. We never did figure out how to get the \"free\" non-motorized watersports, but opted to pay for scuba lessons and parasailing (both well worth the money). Don't be surprised by topless sun bathers - it takes a day to get used to and then you don't even notice. 6) Rooms - The rooms were nicely sized and well-equipped with a refrigerator stocked every other day and extra's if you requested them. We asked for extra beer and bottled water and received about 6 large bottles of water and 4 extra beers for the fridge. The sodas were nice for the kids in the evening so you didn't have to run somewhere to find something to drink. The cleaning people were pretty transparent in that they didn't bother you until you were gone and then did an excellent job cleaning the rooms. On the downside - Our One and Only complaint about the Riu Tequila were the hard beds and pillows! I thought people were exaggerating when they reviewed them, but they were right on the mark. Hard doesn't even describe the beds - had to keep turning in the night to keep the blood circulating. The Riu Tequila could easily imrove themselves greatly by simply putting in softer mattresses or some sort of pad so you don't feel like you are sleeping on the cement. But I was normally so tired, it didn't stop me from sleeping! Great Place - Family Friendly - Palatial Feel Without Being Too Gaudy - Relaxing - Nice. If I had it to do over again, I'd have taken my own pillow and put the extra blankets beneath the sheets for some extra comfort; have taken a more \"refreshing\" air freshener (yeah, it was a bit musty, but you should expect that in a humid area); skipped actually buying anything in Playa del Carmen (go window shopping, but buy your souvenirs inland - much cheaper); and done more in the evening at the other Riu's we had access to. The one thing we did Right was to Not take a taxi or shuttle from the airport to the Riu! When you land in Cancun, take a right when you walk out of the arrivals and walk until you find the public buses labeled ADO. These were $8 per person for a ride to Playa del Carmen and then a $5 taxi ride from the bus station to our resort. The shuttles would have been about $260 for the four of us round trip. We ended up not getting a rental car and used the ADO public buses to go everywhere. Probably saved $200 in the long run. Plus you don't have the headache of trying to drive in the towns where it takes a special type of driver with nerves of steel (not for me). Great vacation!

The rooms where fine and had everything we needed, the mini bar was stocked every two days. We had a towel animal everyday and the kids didn't like to pull them apart so we had quite a collection towards to end of the holiday, the maid did a brilliant job on the rooms they were spotless, if anyone deserved a tip it was her. The food was great there was a big selection everyday and we never got bored with it as they changed it every night. Breakfast and lunch was brilliant too and there was always lots of fresh fruit. I liked the fact that you could help yourself to soft drinks, coffee, tea and beer from 10.30am until 6pm. The pools were great, there was one with a pool bar and another one which was the activity pool. There was always plenty of beds, if you wanted shade then you needed to get to the pool for around 9am. The pools were cleaned and tested everyday. It is a really freindly hotel and we got to know lots of people while we were there. We loved all the different animals that we saw especially the big iguana that came out by the pool and sunned itself everyday. The animation team were great they worked so hard, I loved their shows they were very funny. Most of them took their time to get to know you and we loved to sit and get them a drink at the end of each evening. Big hola to Natalia. We did a 4 excursions, we did Chitzen Itza by air the plane ride was amazing it was only a 12 seater plane and as there were 13 of us my Husband got to sit up front with the captain. If you go there take the hotel umbrella with you as it is unbelievably hot and not much shade. We swam with the dolphins at Isla Majures, that was well worth the money, we drove to Cancun then boarded boat and sailed to Isla Majures. We swam with the dolphins and the sharks ( there is a plastic screen around you) we then went on a bicycle ride to the turtle farm be warned don;t do this unless your fit I nearly died there are no gears on the bikes. We then had one hour touring the Island in convoy on golf buggies this was good fun and you get to see so much. Then you are given one hour to explore and shop before returning to the boat. We visited Xcaret this was nice but there was a lot of walking to be done, we didn't stay for the night show because we were absolutly shattered and it was starting to get a bit expensive paying for food and drinks. Beware you have to pay for your snorkels and it wasn't cheap luckily we had our own. We also visited Xel-Ha this was worth the money and for me better than Xcaret, we paid all inclusive and had a really fun day. We love to snorkel and this is really was this is all about, some of the fish you see are masive and a bit scary when you see their teeth. Only one thing to watch out for at the Hotel is that if you have a ground floor room don't leave anything on the balcony as one of our friends had two bikinis and a snorkel mask stolen, unfortunatley they also had their towels taken from around the pool two days before that as well. But I havn't heard anyone else with this problem.

First of all we took our kids, ages 10 and 7, and this was our third consecutive year to the area. Each year we we tried different resorts and seem to compare the 3. As for the Tequila it is rated a 4 golden apple which was a downgrade for us but the price fit into this years budget. The other 2 were rated 5 golden and there was a noticable difference in the amount of ammenities and quality of the nightly shows. Considering the price we thought it was a good value. WHAT WE LIKED: The food at the Tequila was VERY good and there was a good selection on the buffet each night to please everyone. Comparing it to the other two 5 golden apple resorts we thought it was much better. We tried the steakhouse one night and thought it was ok but not great. Everyone working at the buffet was very helpfull and went out of their way to make things great, especially the waiter Cha Cha who went out of his way for us. Our mini fridge was always stocked with bottled soda,water, and beer. The staff made sure it was full every day or two and we never ran out of beverages. If you're bigger drinkers than us there is a liquor dispensor with full bottles of tequila,rum,vodka and gin in every room. After doing our homework and posting questions on the MyTravelBoard web board we chose to stay in building 8 or 9 which did turn out to be a good lead for us because it was centerally located to the pool areas as well as a short walk to the resturants. I had sent an e-mail to the resort prior to leaving with a building request but also made a request upon checkin and we were given room 916 on the second floor which we found to like very much. The bartenders at the swimup bar were all great as well as at the other bars.Every now and then we'd tip them for a job well done and it was appreciated. Also our room maid was great and our kids looked forward to seein what type of towel art animal they would find upon returning from the pool or beach. We tipped him $2 daily as we normally do. Another thing we really liked about the Tequila was the ability to use the facilities of the RIU Playacar and the RIU Yucatan which were both on the beach and not a very long walk away. As well as using the beach and pool areas you can also use the buffets for all but dinner. We spent a lot of time at the Yucatan and a golfcart style trolley went between the Tequila and Yucatan if you didnt want to walk. We found this to be a very nice nice option especially since we spent 9 nights at the resort. The beach was absolutely wonderfull in front of the Yucatan and great for swimming and body surfing. Chairs were never too hard to come by even though there were always lots of people on the beach. The water is an awesome blue color and our kids loved being in the ocean as much as the pool this time around. WHAT COULD IMPROVE: The first thing we noticed that didnt sit well was us was the depth of the pool areas if you have younger kids.Our 7 yr old was very limited to how much pool area he could use due to the fact he is not a good swimmer yet and most of the pool was right to the top of his head. There were 2 or 3 smaller areas in each pool where it wasnt that deep though. The nightly shows were definately a step down from the past 2 resorts we were to and didnt seem to be well put together. Other years we spent every night at the show but didnt do so this year. Our favorite show was Grease but the rest were just ok. The room was spacious enough but as most people said we too didnt care for the bed arrangement. Two full size beds are together side by side and the mattereses and pillows are on the hard side. Basically it was like we were all sleeping in one big bed but we did get some relief when we requested a rollaway bed part way through the trip. There is non potable water in the room so we brushed our teeth with the bottled water we were provided with. This is common in most resorts but something to consider. OVERALL: After spending 9 nights at the RIU Tequila and being unsure of a few things with the resort we decided for the price we paid to stay there this year we would go back again although might choose another 5 golden apple rated resort if the price was right.", "Date": "June 26, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kansas City", "Title": "\u201cfabulous resort\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5378053", "Content": "My family with 2 kids (10 & 8 years old).

The ROOMS are clean and spacious although the decoration wasn't quite to our taste! They are in any case clean and the air-con a heaven send in the heat! The maid service was daily and they did a good job! The STAFF are really friendly we booked through Thomsons and were introduced to all the mgt team so that if we had any problems we knew who to contact. One thing that really impressed us was that them mgt team actually wander the hotel and make themselves known to all guests, everyone is there to help which is great! The FOOD is the thing that really made our stay enjoyable it is fantatsic, the breakfast buffet and main even meal is served in the main restaurant and you really are spoilt for choice there is something for everyone no matter how fussy an eater you may be from chinese, mexican and italian and loads more as well of choices of fish and meats salads vegetables fruits etc etc the list is endless! This is the only hotel that we have stayed at where all restaurants and all drinks are part of the ALL INCLUSIVE. The BEACH is great clear blue waters and soft white sand truely a picture perfect postcard and you also get to use the hotel beach towels the only down side to the beach area is that you don't get any sun umbrellas so it can get a bit hot without any shade however you could always pop into the Rui Yucutan restaurant where you can grab a drink,meal,snack as there facilities were also open to us. Another thing that was great was that all non motorised water sports are part of the ALL INCL package we went canoeing, pedal boating in the ocean and didn't have to pay! The beach is about a 10min walk away but if you cannot make that distance they operate a buggy that runs you across in minutes! In terms of EXCURSIONS its well worth doing XCARET it costs $59 each and is a great day out. We went swimming in teh underground caves and lagoons watched the dolphins and loads more / it can be really hot walking around so make sure you take plenty of sun lotion and light clothing. XEL HA was another one we did again similar to the above but on a smaller scale, you will be able to see it all in about 5 hours but again its a great experience and well worth the fee.

Well as usual Mexico didn't dissapoint its our favourite holiday destination. The RIU hotel group are fantastic, RIU Tequila very good. We opted for a deal that selected one of the RIU hotels on arrival, so although we didn't know whether we would be staying in either RIU Playacar, RIU Yucatan or the RIU Tequlia we would not have been dissapointed with any of them. Summary of main aspects of holiday: Hotel Accomodation: Initially our room was a little musty but because of the humidity in Mexico it is difficult to avoid, the hotel instantly sent a repair man and the minor problem with the air conditioning unit was fixed, they left us some fruit and a bottle of Tequila for our troubles but believe me it was sorted so quickly it didnt bother us at all. The rooms are large with two double beds ( very hard - our only complaint the whole time but every one we talked said the same about the beds), there is a large bathroom with shower and large wardrobe - so plenty of space for your glad rags ladies!!!!! The room was cleaned daily, very nice staff. Minibar/refridgerator restocked every other day and get this, they have optics in your room Tequila/vodka/gin/whisky. Patio areas are a little small but sufficient for chilling. Food: The food was tremendous, always piping hot, good selection and something for everyone. My favourite was the ice cream dispensers at lunch time well 12-4pm and the ice cream at dinner from 6.30 to 10pm. If your planning on going soon try the seafood on sunday evenings in the buffet restaurant - Amazing we have never had such delicious paella any where else. The steak house restaurant is good but didn't rate the seafood restaurant at the beach club - Other people said it was okay so maybe we went on a bad day as the food was on the cold, burnt side - but try it if you go, and if you don't like it you can always go to the buffet resaurant afterwards and you won't be dissapointed. Pool: fantastic pool bar, staff very friendly and very hard working, the pools are clean and plenty of pool beds. If you want a prime spot with shade you will have to go early to get a spot. But if you don't get a spot you can always go to one of the other hotels near the beach. It didn.t matter that there was no pool as it was only a 5 to ten minute walk to either Yucutan of Playacar beach. We preferred the RIU Playacar pool during the day as you had the beach handy and pool nice, usually a bit quieter as there is no transport to this hotel but its worth the little walk. The RIU Tequila also has a sports bar with pool tables and air hockey(for additional charge) plenty of TVs for the football - we were there for 2 England World Cup matches - excellent atmosphere. Beaches in mexico amazing best ever, sea turquoise and clear. Entertainmet: Usual stuff during day around pool, good fun and they don't make you join in if you don't want to like some places. Evening entertainment good some visiting companys as well so lots of variation. We also did trip round kitchen and Palace visit. Trips: Sea fishing excellent (Captain Riks - Portra Adventuruos Marina area) Caught 110lb Marlin (unbelievable), Xcaret park excellent our favourite. We did Chitchen Itza on our last trip very good but long bus journey (if you can afford it try the flight to Chitzen Itza instead of the coach trip). Do your shopping in Playa Del Carmen or Cancun good souveniers to be had but be very careful about your baggage allowance as you will be charged in Cancun if you go over approx $12 per extra KILO. We also did the Captain Hook trip good fun and very good dinner Lobster/chicken and steak. Take some sickness pils if you get a bit sea sick, its not that it is choppy but its a shame to be a bit ill. as it is a good fun night out and dinner surprisingly good. Weddings - If you are planning your wedding here you hpefully will have a great day. we saw one during our stay and it was beautiful, the wedding co-ordinator looked totally in control, there doesn't seem to be a huge number of weddings going on so you won't feel like your on a conveyor belt as in some places (Jaimaca-Sandals resorts, we saw 11 weddings in one day, av about 7 a day) so hpefully you wont be dissapointed. We wished we had wed there instead of back home in England - it appeared to be a lot less stressful. - Good Luck!! There is quite a bit of wild life in the hotel grounds, especially lookout for the racoons (well they look like racoons to me) very sweet and the love bananas and apples. They tend to hang out at the back of the Tequila just outside our room 1905 have a look, they are very friendly. Well what else is there, everything fantastic, i didn't know what day it was the first week as I was so chilled. The last thing to mention is the hotel staff and generally the mexican people - I don't think I have seen more hard working genuine people as them. The hotel staff are constantly working very hard and are a real credit to the hotel and they made us feel at home - nothing was too much trouble.

On arrival, however, it didn't quite meet up to our expectations. I must say that overall, we had a great holiday, but there are plusses and negatives of this hotel. The negatives first...All the other reviews (and the brochure) had made it out to be a 4 star luxury hotel which could not be faulted. The hotel itself looked OK from the outside, but as soon as we got to the room, we were disappointed. Our room was on the ground floor, and the balcony looked out on to a barbed wire fence, where around 6-10 racoons were hovering constantly, waiting to come and say hello! We felt like we couldn't go out on the balcony at all because they might come and visit us. Plus, who wants to stare at a fence when they have just travelled 11hrs to get away from the hum drum of everyday life. After having unpacked (a mistake), we decided to take a shower. The shower itself was horrific. It had cracked tiles everywhere, was dark and dingy, and looked like something out of a prison or concentration camp. At this time, we were tired and disappointed. The hotel reception called at this point to check the room was OK. When I mentioned that it wasn't, the guy at reception said he would call us back, and didn't. We decided that the only thing to do would be to go and visit reception ourselves. After a long struggle (and being told that we would have to move rooms in the morning), we managed to get them to move our room to another identical one, but with a better view nearer the pool. The room inside was still the same tired, basic decor, which felt a bit more like a cantina than a luxury hotel, but at least the view was better. Later that night we went to explore, and asked where the gym and beach were. The receptionist told us to go through the sister hotel, the Riu Palace, and there we would find the beach and the gym. On entering the Riu Palace, we were amazed. This hotel is truly amazing!! This is what we were expecting from our hotel. We decided not to be too dispondent with our room, as we could surely come to the beach and gym and live from the Riu Palace, which was a much better standard of hotel. A few days later, however, when we got a drink from the beack bar in the palace, we were told 'No, my friend, this is the RIU PALACE, you are in the Tequila, and you can't get a drink from here'. Despite being told we could definitely visit this great hotel, we were constantly met with 'No, my friend, you are in the Tequila' and reminded of affiliation with our bog standard hotel, rather than the great Palace, which I would highly reccomend (after sneaking into the gym and pool again several more times...'No, my friend...!'. On the plus side, the food was great at the Tequila. There was such a selection - mexican, italian, american, english, and it was always fresh and hot and plentiful. We ate at the steakhouse one night and although the service wasn't great, the food was nice. The sports bar was good - there was pool and table football and air hockey. The only thing was that these were v expensive! $2 a go, which is pretty pricey for a pool table! There were lots of other couples around - mostly honeymooners, like us. When we went into Playa Del Carmen ($5 taxi), everyone in the shops asked if we were honeymooners, and we were thrilled to say, yes we were! I was now Mrs Dee! This made us feel special, although am sure it was a sales pitch. At one point we were being sold a football shirt which was blatantly fake, which the seller assured us was not because of the word 'authentic' which was in the back neck label!!! This amused us. Overall, i'd say great for a budget holiday in the sun, but don't take your honeymoon there or have a special holiday there, as it would be disappointing.

It was not a problem going across the street to the beach (you need the excercise after all the food and drinks!)....for those who can not walk that far...they have a golf cart to tote you back and forth. There is so much to do - from parasailing off the beach to taking a day excursion to Xel-ha (highly reccommend booking a fully inclusive deal - also check around...one travel agency charges $16 more to book the same excursion). We also enjoyed snorkling off Cozumel and saw beautiful parrot fish and more! There are more exclusive (and more expensive places) to stay in Playa - but I would not trade the experience we had a Rui Tequila...the grounds are immaculate, the staff works very hard to please the guests, and an awesome pool! The only thing I would recommend is to bring lots of $1 bills to tip....the workers work very hard for very little money to please us......I could not imagine having to live off of what they make.....plus you will get great drinks! The only negative was the Seafood restaurant where you make reservations....skip it...the buffet was much better. The Steakhouse was worth booking. For a 5 night stay we never got bored with the buffet. Went to town one night and had dinner and went to the Blue Parrot disco which is right on the beach - what a blast dancing with young people! Lots of great shops in Playa...you can bargain with some of the vendors...but watch out.

I'd recommend the steak restuarant and if you eat in the main buffet restaurant sit outside - it's more romantic! We went to Tulum and Xel-Ha on a day trip booked through Thomson - friendly guide, air conditioned bus and on time. Tulum was good - go early as it gets very hot. Take a towel off the coach with you if you fancy a dip in the beautiful turquoise sea there. Xel Ha (a water national park) was worth a visit too - there were lots of fishes to see when snorkelling if you stick to the edges. The rest of the week we spent lounging by the pool or on the beach - the only worry was - who was going to go the bar for the next drink! Some of the evening entertainment wasn't great - go to the Michael Jackson show though - it's great.

You definitely get your monies worth here in this resort. Arrival (10 out of 10) -Once again I booked my vacation through Apple vacations, and they exceeded our expectations as always. Great Service!!! -Checked in was painless and we got our keys and towel cards quickly. The hotel is obviously outdated since we the key was an actually key rather than a card. Room (7 out of 10) -The room is nice but because it is in this area which is very humid, it does have a mildew smell. I recommend bringing a traveling candle. -It's an average room. There's nothing special except for the mini bar is stocked up well and that there are liquor dispensers that has vodka, tequila, rum, and gin. It came in handy. -My biggest complaint is that the a/c seems to never be on. It was always hot in our room and in the room of the people that we came with. Pool & Beaches (9 out of 10) -The pools were really clean and nice. -There are a lot of children in the pools. It would have been nice if we had an adult pool, since all of us are in our twenties and are not around many children. -Yes the chairs tend to be reserve early on, but we were always able to find a nice spot by the pool. -Out of the two swim up bars, I liked the one at the Yucatan best because it had lots of little tables that you can set you\u2019re drink on and sit and have a good time. -The beach is a 5 minute walk from the Riu Tequila, but there is always a shuttle ready to pick you up. I really enjoyed the walked since it is under a shaded walkway. -The beach is beautiful, and there are always chairs available. Some of the chairs closes to the water were taken up early, but I didn\u2019t bother us because were still right there. -I also enjoyed the fact that they had so many activities. There are windsurfing, catamaran, kayaking, paddleboat, and more. You\u2019ll never get bored. Restaurant (7 out of 10) -The main buffet for breakfast, lunch, and dinner was nice, but we got bored of the food very quickly. -Since there are only two restaurants that the Tequila and Yucatan has access to, it tend to fill up very quickly. You had to be there by 7:00am no later then 8:00am. Luckily we got to go one night at the steak house. The service was decent, but the food was much better then we had expected. It turned out to be a very good dinner. -Lupita is by the pool, and they have a great lunch buffet. It was very convenient to hand by the pool and walk right over to get lunch. Bar (6 out of 10) -Bar was average. Not great drinks, but not bad either. -The club was lots of fun only because they played great music. the bartendars couldn't make any shots. All they knew how to do were these shots call tequila boom boom. It was fun, but got od after a while. My only complaint really is definitely the A/C and the fact the staff was not very happy and fun. The service was not great. You really have to serve yourself for the most part. It wouldn't hurt if they smile once in a while. Bonuses: -I highly reccommend going into Playa del Carmen restrauant and bar district. We went to Blue Parrott and had a blast. Check it out, it was right on the beach. There are also lots of other hip and chic places to go. -Also, going to Cozumel and renting a jeep is also a blast.

No signs of hurricane damage except for the random palm tree on the beach at the Yucatan. The moment the tour bus pulled up to the resort, you can't help but notice the beautiful lobby right in front of you!. Check in is quick and efficient- you just hand in your hotel voucher and they hand you your room key. The food is fantastic!. I enjoyed breakfast the most!. Eggs,bacon, sausage,pancakes, you name it - it's there!. Lunch at the Tequila is at the restaurant by the pool area. Hotdogs,Pizza and Hamburgers were regular lunch items with a few other items that would change from day to day.Dinner- we never tried the Steak House or the Mediterannian restaurants (which require reservations), we ate at the main dining room every night and the selection there is incredible!. The bars are only open till 12:30am however; there is a 24 hour Sports bar next to the disco where we met the bar manager Victor who is one of the hardest workers we have ever met!. We found the drinks were excellent no matter which bar we visited at the resort- try a Miami Vice. The rooms- we never encountered the musty smell that some people have mentioned in their reviews. We found the beds to be comfortable as we prefer a firmer mattress to sleep on anyway and to our surprise there are 50 television channels and almost half of them are in english!. There is a complimentary safe in your room and a bar fridge stocked every second day with Corona, bottled water and an assortment of soda's. The beach- my favourite part. This is the reason why I chose to come back to Mexico then travel elsewhere. The sand is sugar white and the sea is the most beautiful shade of turquoise you will ever see!. There are few palm trees that were damaged from last year's hurricane and there are plenty of lounge chairs on the beach for you to choose from. We did not swim in the pool once the entire trip!. For $70.00 US, we went parasailing together and I managed to take some incredible pictures overlooking Playacar from the sky!. Entertainment- Grease was fun!. These people REALLY go out of their way to try and entertain everyone at the resort. Excursions- We went to Chichen Itza (which we booked through our Sunquest rep at the resort). It was $75 US per person and that covered everything(admission,food,water). Our tour guide, Armando, started the tour off with giving us a brief history on Chichen Itza and the Mayan Civilization. Armando could answer any question that was asked and my boyfriend and I will agree that he has certainly left a wonderful impression with us as he was so gracious that we all chose to come to Mexico over any place else!. It is a 12 hour day and lots of walking- wear runners and bring a bottle of water from the resort if you remember. I would not recommend this day trip for families with children. I went to Tulum last time I was there- the ruins are not as beautiful as in Chichen Itza but is still worth seeing and I promise all your photos will be beautiful!. It is hotter in Chichen Itza- it reached 38 degrees the day we visited as it is inland and not by water like Tulum. We had such a wonderful stay at the Riu Tequila. We can't wait to go back!.

The retaurant catered for every possible taste and the choice was amazing, with added extras through the 2 weeks of bbq's, sea food specials and display cooking. The bars all had menus of the cocktails, long drinks, spirits, fruit drinks, liquers, soft drinks and coffees available and I would defy anyone not to be satisfied with the choice on offer.

It had everthing in this park, water activities, the swim through the underground river was fabulous and lasted about 50 mins and I would recommend this for all ages, the gounds were beautiful full of wildlife both in enclosures and roaming the grounds. The river boat ride was a 20 minute tranquil trip that enabled you to look at the wonderful birds, butterflies and scenery all around. In the centre there is an amazing structure that is made up of individual tombs which are arranged in a cicular pyramid shape, there are several hundred of them all individually designed, it was quite breathtaking to see them.

I think the first thing which hit me as I arrived was the stunning lobby, which is incredibly airy and light, with a large fountain and plenty of seating for you to collapse onto after a very long journey! I was quite amazed, never before have I seen such a lovely entrance to a hotel- it was full of character. As we were on our way to our room, we came across an \"Agouti\"- these are gorgeous cute little creatures around the size of a cat, they are very shy but we saw them everywhere, i had a particular affection for these animals! We also saw plenty of other animals and reptiles- some huge lizards and iguanas just roaming around the pool whilst you were sunbathing, noisy and colourful birds which don't stop eating, and the raccoon style critters which were VERY friendly and we fed them fruit out of our hands.. they won't bite!! The food is fantastic- every diet catered for, and every nationality- mexican, american, italian, chinese, japanese.. you name it. And the desserts, oh gosh! every time i went for a meal i couldnt move i was so full! By the way, we didnt have trouble with dodgy stomachs, sickness etc either, fyi! Selection of drinks was great, including imported branded spirits which you normally dont see on an all inclusive unless you pay LOADS, or extra. the red wine was particularly nice, and the cocktails delicious- even the non alcoholic ones, very refreshing in the day. Not happy about people being so offended by topless sunbathing, what on earth is wrong with it, dont you see that at every hotel you stay at? its not confined to the walls of this hotel. the pool was clean and constantly glasses were collected, leaves picked out of the pool during the day.. the sunloungers in the pool were a blessing! obviously being by the pool is quite noisy but it doesnt mean you cant sit and read your book or go to sleep.. it isnt THAT loud- ive been to places where they have blasted music out all day! The golf buggy is really useful to whip you down to the beachfront in about 2 minutes, but the walk is flat, cool and pleasant. you have to go through the beach bar to get to the beach, so stop off for a drink on the way! The beach always has plenty of sunbeds, and its much more comfortable to lie in the sun there as its very windy. as a result, the sea is rough (for most of the time we went to the beach, it was a red flag) so not safe really for small kids and you cant snorkel. The scuba Caribe team on the beach organise watersports- you can parasail, scuba dive and take snorkelling trips. i went on a snorkelling trip. the reef was not really very colourful compared to other diving destinations (Red sea egypt, maldives etc) and i didnt see a great variety of fish but this could have been because the sea was so rough. the best snorkelling we did was at Xcaret, and Xel-Ha. Xcaret is 5 mins away in a taxi, and Xel Ha about 45 mins away... both are MUST DO trips (combine Xel Ha with the morning in Tulum) Xcaret speaks for itself, check out their website for more info, and Xel ha more for people who enjoy being in the water. Both brilliant days out regardless of age or swimming ability. I got to jump off the \"cliff of courage\" into a lagoon which is something ive always wanted to do! it was LOADS of fun. saw turtles and all sorts. Go and visit the Mayan ruins, but Chichen Itza is quite far away- I would advise visits to Tulum though definitely, its stunning location on the beach and fascinating stories about mayan culture mean its another \"must do\" activity! we booked all our trips with independant companies in the Playacar Plaza. Our room was clean and tidy, with a few towel creatures every few days. the minibar was stocked up every 2 days with 4 beers, 2 big bottles water, 2 bottles Fanta, 2 x 7up, 2x tonic and 2 x soda water, plus more spirits in the Optics if required. really relaxing to chill on the balcony with a drink or 5! The entertainment was pretty standard- mexican shows, Michael jackson show, Grease, Moulin rouge- it was something to do! The music in the disco was the same evry night but who would want to go EVERY SINGLE night anyway?! bar staff at night were very fast and efficient. Altogether, a briliant holiday, i loved mexico and would definitely recommend it to anyone who wants a holiday full of sun, culture, nice food, great wildlife, nice people, and history. But beware of bringing lots of souvenirs home with you because the mexicans are extremely strict on baggage allowance, and if you are over your 20kg limit they charge you $12 PER KILO!

We we're getting a bit tired of drinking by the end of the fortnight, but thats what happens when you try and drink 14 nights in a row...;) Service: Almost all the staff bend over backwards to help and do whatever they can. The bar staff have another drink sat waiting for you each time you finish, I'm sure they want to get you drunk early so they can finish early...:) Everyday when you get back the maids have cleaned and tidied up your rooms. Bars: The two bars round the theatre close at midnight, then you can move onto the club, or the sportsbar which is open 24 hours a day. Excursions: We did the xel-ha and tulum and the fat cats. Quick word of warning about fat cats, make sure you take some travel sickness tablets before sailing, most people on the day we went didn't and nearly everyone was very quesy by the end of it...... As for xel-ha and tulum this was a fantastic day out. Tulum is breathtaking, with it;s mayan ruins overlooking the beach. Xel-ha is basically a massive waterpark. I had read reviews on here with people saying it was very busy, we went on a saturday and it was fine. Beach: We headed down to the beach most days as there was no breeze round the pool. Yucatan pool seemed a lot better with music playing and lots of crazy games (such as, crazy belly flop competition).... Fifth Avenue: This was the only part of our holiday we didn't enjoy. I would recomend people try it, but we all felt uncomfortable after about 5 minutes of being there. Overall: Riu Tequilla is the best hotel I've ver stayed in. The food is fantastic, the drinks are plentiful and the staff are alwayshelpful and pleasent.", "Date": "May 16, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bonnie , Scotland", "Title": "\u201cTequila BOOM BOOM\u201d", "Author": "Scottyboy_10", "ReviewID": "UR5143559", "Content": "Hotel is kept very tidy and the people who work there are very friendly \"hola\" is a word you will find coming your way very often from all staff!!!!!

Check in was quick even though there was an \"unfriendly sort\" helping us at the front desk. Our room was 715 on the upper level of one of the complexes. I would suggest that if you are older and do not like climbing stairs - you ask for a room on the ground floor. The room is simple but clean. The young man who cleaned it every day was very friendly and provided us with anything we needed. A nice deck with a clothes drying rack was available to hang swimsuits and towels. The bathrrom has a large walk in shower. There is also a mini bar with 4 bottles of liquor (Rum, Tequila, Vodka, Gin). The refridgerator is stocked with an array of sodas, large purified water bottles and beer. The grounds are very nice and there are funny little animals scooting every now and then around looking for food. We were told they are like racoons here in the States but look nothing like them. They have no tail and a long pointed nose. We also saw what looked like a spider monkey but may have bben something else. The pool is quite nice and the bartenders - especially a young man named David - were friendly and worked fast and hard. We noticed the drinks were better if you tipped accordingly. The dining areas were fabulous and beautiful. They were set with nice linen tablecloths and napkins. Staff were qquick to take away dirty cups from coffee and plates if you felt you wanted to go through the buffet again. The food was very tasty and SO MUCH of it! ANYTHING you can imagine to eat was available. We did eat in the dining area with the special steak dinner and found it good but nothing to get too excited about. The beach is a short walk but there is a little tram that you can take back and forth. It is a bit crowded there but still very nice. We bought an air mattress to \"ride the waves\" which is a must - it was fun in the pool too. The evening entertainment is ok - we only went to one show and left early as it didn't seem to be that entertaining. There is an internet cafe' in the Sports Bar. It is pricy - $35 pesos for 15 minutes. I counted 17 overhead TV's in the bar with pool tables, and other game tables for the younger crowd. There is also a disco that is open late at night, We are in our 50's - so nothing we were interested in. The hotel seemed to attract mostly the 30-40 year olds. Lots of people from Europe and Canada. I saw some teenagers and smaller kids. There was a very small pool and sand area for the \"tiny tots\" - but in the beating sun! One other thing - there are many women who go topless - so be prepared if you are with young children who may be surprised by it and ask questions. Also, be prepared that your husband or boyfriend may want to hang out by the pool or beach a little longer!", "Date": "May 15, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cFabulous Once Again\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5068494", "Content": "I stayed at the Riu Tequila from May 6-13 and had an excellent time. My boyfriend and I went last year and loved it so much that we decided to go back for a second time. This time we brought two of our closest friends and they enjoyed it as well. The animation staff were very friendly and would come around everyday to try and get guests to particpate in the daily activities. I would advise you to get involved with activities such as beach volleyball, darts, water basketball and aerobics, this way you will get to know everyone and makes the stay so much more enjoyable. The rooms were cleaned everyday early in the morning so you didn't have to wait for the maid to finish in the afternoon when you wanted to go back to the room. We e-mailed the hotel about three weeks before we arrived asking for a room on the second level, near the pool and close to the friends we were travelling with and they granted everything we had requested. The main dining area was spectacular. Last year they had set seating arrangements for breakfast and dinner. You could have dinner between 6:30 - 8:00 or 9:00-10:30 and you were always at the same table everyday. This year they didn't have that anymore and you could simply go to breakfast or dinner whenever you desired (which was a lot better). I would recommend going into Playa Del Carmen one night for dinner this way it gives you a break from the buffet food you've been having all week. It is only about a 5 minute taxi ride (it is very easy to find a taxi) and costs only $5 US. The town is extremely safe and there are all kinds of tourists from all the resorts in the surrounding area. I would recommend a restaurant called AGUA. It is right across from the bar that has swings for chairs. We had lobster and steak, and it was EXCELLENT. The servers were very friendly and the manager even came up to us and shook our hands thanking us for our business. The food melted in your mouth and although it was a bit expensive (two dinners, glass of wine, coke and water came out to $140 US with tip) it was worth every penny and like I mentioned earlier it was a nice break from the resort food. The beach is only a 5 minute walk from the resort and they do have the shuttle that brings you directly to Riu Yucatan. Just remember the shuttle stops between 1:00pm-3:00pm so if you decide to go the beach try to get there before 1:00 unless you don't mind walking. There is a nice, shaded pathway that you follow to the beach and once you get there you can hang out at Riu Yucatan and have a nice drink because it is very hot down there. This resort is excellent and if it wasn't I would not have gone back for a second time. I would rate this resort 10 out of 10. We had no complaints about anything. The grounds, staff and food was great and the shows at night which start at 10:00pm are wonderful to watch because the animation staff are in them. They get audience involvement and will come and ask you to dance with on stage (We did and it was fun). They have a sports bar near the stage area with about 5 pool tables, 2 air hockey machines and arcade games and most importantly a bar. We spend most of our evenings in there shooting pool but you have to buy pesos from the bar tender in order to use the games. Just bring a couple of $1 US bills and it will buy a few games of pool. I am very sad to be back and wish we could have stayed longer. We made many friends and would like to thank Ricardo, Adan, Illario and Victor Daniel (pool bartender) for making our stay once again at Riu Tequila a great memory. I hope to see you all again in the near future.", "Date": "May 14, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington, Michigan", "Title": "\u201cMy favourite Riu\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5030818", "Content": "We have been to many all inclusive hotels throughout the Caribbean and to Riu Bambu in Punta Cana and a Riu in Cuba. We enjoyed the Riu Tequila the best. We were there with our 15 year old son and another couple with a 13 and 10 year old, over spring break. We enjoyed the food very much but after going to the Mediterranean restaurant, we decided not to go to the Steakhouse since the buffet had such a good selection. It would be hard to complain about the buffet food as it was very good and there was plenty to choose from. It would be nice to see shrimp and lobster though. As for the wine, it was fine out of the barrels in the diningroom. We did have some wine over at the Yucatan bar and it was really terrible; it seemed as though it had been left open on the counter for a few weeks. We were in building 9, on the 2nd floor, which we requested. It was a great place to stay as it was close to the pool and eating areas. We took a deodorizer, but our room had no smell at all and we had a nice view of the golf course too. The beds were hard but we had read that in every review. They did have Canadian Club at the bar, which we had been told wasn't available and we always asked for Jose Cuervo tequila in our drinks, otherwise they would give you the cheaper brand. Also, the pina coladas tasted pretty bad, until we asked for dark rum, which helped a lot. In our opinion the Riu's do not make great drinks and this seems to be common with all the Riu's we've visited. The disco wasn't as bad as everyone said either, except one night, it did smell like someone had been sick. However, the other nights, we couldn't detect any odour and although there were lots of teenagers in the disco, they were not doing anything that bad. Our only complaint was that the disco played constant techno music. One night they had 70's and 80's music and the teenagers cleared out. We moved to the Riu Cancun for the weekend (they overbooked the Tequila and asked people if they wanted to change hotels). Since none of us had been to Cancun we decide to go. It's a beautiful hotel, however, we preferred the Tequila. The Cancun felt like you were in a big city hotel. We preferred the open air lobby and the open air theatre at the Tequila. Also, the Cancun only had Canadian Mist, their wine was that really bad stuff they had at the Yucatan (except in the restaurants) and it was a 15 story building compared to the 2 floor buildings at the Tequila. It was really nice having the ocean view though. However,we wouldn't have paid the extra money to stay on the ocean at the Yucatan. The entertainment at both resorts was typical of all the all inclusives we have visited. After a while you get bored watching the same people dancing each night. They do have a ton of energy though. Playa del Carmen was defintely a spot to go after dinner as there are many bars and it's a great place to pick up souvenirs. It seemed very safe too. When we went to Cancun we went on the Pirate Ship, for a lobster dinner and it was well worth the money. They kept the drinks flowing, you were entertained the whole time and by the end of the evening, they had everyone on the ship, up dancing. Beware though, that they will be looking for tips at the end of the night, since the servers are waitors. We always go somewhere different every year, but I would not hestitate to recommend the Tequila as we all had a wonderful time there.", "Date": "May 3, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cRead carefully before you book\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5021069", "Content": "First off, I must tell you that we chose RIU Tequila because of the price and knew that we weren't getting a 5 star place, but did excpect more since we read every review possible before booking. If you have chosen to stay at RIU Tequila I will give you hints on how to make the stay more enjoyable. This is going to be long, but hopefully informative. Rooms- The first impression was when we opened the door and smelled mildew right away. My neice and her boyfriend had the adjoining room, which smelled like sulfur the entire week. The rooms were clean and I never saw mold, but the smell came back home with us on our clothes in the suitcase. Nice size room with tiled flooring, 2 large very old and very hard beds pushed together to make one huge bed. When people have mentioned the beds and pillows being hard, they did not exaggerate. I assumed these people were really old and extremely picky, but I was wrong. I am not so picky about beds, especially thinking that we'll be worn out by bedtime and it won't matter. It did matter. The bed was so horrible that I woke up in pain most mornings. Not exaggerating. I never complained, because I feel I knew this going in and got what I paid for. Just know all this going in and be prepared for it. As far as cleaning...we only placed our \"please clean\" note on the doorknob every other day, because that's what we preferred. The room was always cleaned to a tee, but that mildew smell never left. We left a note by the sink (with $5 tip) asking for more waters (the stock amount is 3 large water bottles, but we drink a lot of water) and they left 7 every time. Once we asked for more beer and they left us 12. The fridge is stocked with sodas, waters and beers plus you have the 4 bottles of liquor...you'll never go thirsty! Food- Extremely disappointed. The breakfast was wonderful every single day with plenty to choose from. The people that work the omelette station and eggs/pancake/french toast station have to be the hardest working people in the hotel. The breakfast is just about the only thing I could brag on. Lunch/Snacks are plentiful, but never varied pizza, hot dogs, hamburgers, nachos, salad bar, etc, they were perfect for the pool area. Dinners in the \"everynight\" buffet were horrible. We only went twice and couldn't stomach going back again. That was a huge dissapointment. Getting the reservation for the steak house and the mediterranean place on the beach was a pain. You had to be in line by 6:40am in order to possibly secure a reservation. We don't get up that early at home, but we were so desparate for a decent dinner that we actually did this 3 times. The first time, we were lucky and got in to the steak house. The second time we didn't get a reservation because the person that was 2 people ahead of me in line, had a table of 26 that she made a reservation for. The third time, we got Mediterranean reservations. They only take 30 reservations per seating time, per restaraunt. I was ticked that I got up that early, stood in line and didn't even get the reservation that one day. What they offer...Steak house offered 4 entrees (Ribeye, Top Sirloin, Chicken and a steak kabob) served with a very small ceasar salad to share with the table (we had 4 at our table, the ceasar salad to share with 4 consisted of 6 romaine leaves), 1 roll each, a fried appetizer platter (mushroom, zuchini, chicken wings)that was plentiful, and Baked Alaska for dessert. (The ribeye was the only thing worth ordering. The top sirlion was tough. I normally eat Filet Mignon only, so I may have judged a little harshly here. My 19 year old neice loved it and went back another night). The Mediterranean place was seafood only. Again offered 4 entrees- Salmon, Silver Drum Fish, Seafood Brouchette and a kabob of shrimp, oyster, fish, green pepper and onion. Started with an avacodo salad with 3 small shrimp (tasty), followed by a crab bisque (very very fishy and red tomatoey looking- didn't touch it), the entree and then for dessert a crepe with a scoop of ice cream. I have to mention that my kabob was not cooked and was more like sushi. The manager noticed that I didn't eat much and came over to us. I was not going to complain, just not planning on coming back. He offered to have steak brought over to our table from the steak house, which was very nice but we didn't take him up on it. We didn't get up early again to make reservations, but we did eat in town. : ) Hotel and grounds, staff etc.- The lobby is wonderful. Restaraunt is huge (buffett style setting) and always clean. Pool is huge and contrary to other reviews, we were able to get chairs up front by the pool for 4 people every day. (you just have to be willing to pick one or two up from other areas and bring them to your perfect spot) They even had quite a few concrete lounges in the pool to lay on that were never full. Never a long wait for pool drinks. The staff were amazing. Always offering to help with a smile and were actually offended if you grabbed a drink yourself in the breakfast area. They insisted that \"it was their job\". Wonderful staff. Sunday mornings they have mimosas at breakfast. Beach- the hike across the street was not bad at all. At night it was wonderful. It's a safe walk and nothing to worry about except the heat. I didn't see that \"shuttle\" (golf cart that seats about 10 people) very often to be honest. It wasn't running as much as they'd have you think. More than likely you will be walking. When we booked, the difference between staying at Yucatan and staying at Tequila was about $400 US dollars diffence for a week's stay. It's not worth $400 just to save you from walking to the beach, trust me. At night, you will see possum and such on the walkway, but they run from you. All part of the trip. The beach is beautiful. Plenty of seats, again...if you are prepared to grab one or two and bring them to where you hope to sit. Still worth it. The water is gorgeous and just right for swimming. The beach is a bit crowded, but what do you expect? It's still very nice and worth the walk over. Yucatan vs Tequila....The swim up bars (yes 2) are much better than Tequila. Yucatan plays music at their pool and Tequila didn't. I'm not really into the shows and we have no children...but the shows that we saw at Yucatan were much better than Tequila offered. Seems like kids had stuff planned all day with the staff, so if you go with kids...no worries. Also, Yucatan's outside bar at night was a little more lively than at Tequila. Still overall pretty laid back, not at all \"popping\" like I expected during Spring Break. Bars onsite...this is a biggie for us. Plenty of comments in this area. First off, every bar in all the RIU's closed at 11pm except for the disco which was full of 16-18 years olds grinding and kissing no matter which way you turned. So, if you want to drink onsite after 11pm...that's your only option other than drinking your own in a spot you choose with no service. Not a big deal for a few nights, but 7 nights and no late open bars onsite (when you paid for all inclusive including drinks) is kind of a let down. We went to Senor Frogs in town one night and had a blast. Dancing on the tables and all. Young teens to old adults...all having fun. You could actually walk around without staring at 2 teens tounging each other to death, but you had to pay for your drinks. Not a bad trade. Alcohol- If you are a wine drinker like me, you will be drinking their vinegar or buying your own wine offsite. They offer white, red and rose all of which come from a box and I'm not exaggerating. We went to Sams Club to buy some wine, but it was really expensive. A bottle of Kendall Jackson Chardonnay was $18. RIU Tequila offers well drinks only, no top shelf liquors at all. I could deal with the cheap liquor if the mixers were decent, but the juices tasted really sweet, maybe they were concentrated? The beer they had onsite was Corona (mostly) and Negro, that's it. We wanted Capt Morgan Spiced Rum and couldn't find it anywhere. I ended up buying \"Boost\" which is their Red Bull and mixing it with vodka towards the end of the trip. Not really getting our money's worth if the food is not so great and the alcochol (that's only served until 11pm) isn't all that, either. So here are my tips if you are going to stay at RIU Tequila. 1) Bring a small keychain with you. The key for your room is on a 5 inch plastic keychain that has your room number on it. It's too big too carry around in your shorts everyday and night, plus it has your room number blasted on it. Your 'safe\" key is for an actual lock with a key hosted on a large string to carry around your neck. To save space and save yourself from carrying around 2 bulky key rings, bring one small one and add both keys to it for the week. If you loose the lock key, they charge you $50 US, so best to keep them handy, together and not so big and bulky to carry. 2) Bring Febreeze or some sort of spray air freshener if you can, it will help. A Glade Plug In with a nightlight would be good too. A candle or anything to help keep the room fresh during your stay will help, especially if you have allergies to mold and mildew. 3) Bring your own pillow and small blanket if you have room. Your comfortness depends on this. If you can't bring them...go to WalMart or Sams Club. $5 taxi ride to either is well worth it. 4) Bring a small, inexpensive float for the pool. They have nothing for rent there for the pool, but plenty of room for floats. Again, hit WalMart if you must. 5) If you drink wine, bring a bottle or 2 with you in your carry on bag. It's pretty expensive in the markets, Sams was the best price at $18 a bottle for Kendall Jackson. They didn't have YellowTail or cheaper brands to even choose from other than serious rot got stuff that was still $10 and up. 6) Top Shelf liquor...if your trip will not be the same without your favorite top shelf brand...bring it with you. If you're not picky about your alcohol, you'll be just fine. They even have4 bottles in your room for you. 7) For coffee drinkers, you will not be dissapointed. They have these espresso/cappacino/hot chocolate machines in the Jalisco (buffett area) and one in the La Lupita (by the pool) that will rock your world. Bring a large stainless steel coffee mug with a top on it from home. You will have free wonderful coffee all week. (no coffee maker in the rooms) The also have regular coffee in the Jalisco area by the pot. 8) If you have room, bring a large plastic mug with a top (like you can get at Target) for the cold drinks by the pool and beach. The bartenders will fill you up with whatever you want (soda, water, beer, frozen drinks) and they will stay colder much longer. The sun attacks a cold drink down there faster than anywhere I've been. 9) Walkie Talkies are good if you are travelling in a group. If you have them, bring them...you will use them. 10) If you can't stand a quiet pool and plan on hanging at Tequila more than Yucatan...bring an ipod or small radio. No music at the pool except during the 45 minutes of yoga class they have near the pool. 11) This is only for the people with weak stomachs or in case you don't drink enough water and get dehydrated easily. Bring Ammodium AD and your own soft toilet paper. I didn't get sick at all, because I drank plenty of water daily that is the key. 2 out of 4 of us had problems. Just know that although the room is large, it is nowhere near soundproof. I hope you understand that hint. The toilet paper is very hard and thin, so if you are picky or get sick...this will matter to you. Again, Walmart is a taxi ride away. I told you this would be long, but hopefully informative. Only a few more subjects and I'm finished. Important Times: Breakfast- Jalisco 7am-10:30am buffett, 10:30-12pm continental Lunch- La Lupita 12-3pm, Beach Club (Yucatan/same as Seafood place) 12-4pm, La Hacienda (Yucatan) 1-3pm, Margarita (Yuc) 12-4pm, Turquesa (Playacar) 12-4pm Snacks- La Lupita 3-6pm, Beach Club (Yucatan/same as Seafood place) 4-6pm, La Pinata (Disco) 11pm-1am, Margarita (Yuc) 4-6pm, Turquesa (Playacar) 4-6pm Dinner- Jalisco Buffett 7pm-10:30pm anytime seating Reserved seating at Steak House - 7pm-8:30pm OR 9-10:30pm Reserved seating at Mediterranean (Seafood) - 7pm-8:30pm OR 9-10:30pm Bars: Pool Bar 10:30am-6pm Maguey 6-12pm (lounge bar by the sports bar- I never saw it opened past 11pm) El Kiosco 10:30am-12pm (Pavilion bar in lounge area to the left) La Lupita 10:30am-11pm (actually the dining room and servers bring your drink to table) Disco 11pm-2am (not worth it even for the fun folks, my 19 yr old neice was even grossed out and we like to dance and have fun like most) Excursions- we only did a few things offsite, but I do have pricing on the options. Keep reading. We went on the ATV's. IT operated daily at wither 8:50 or 10:50am for $63 US per person (2 hrs of riding plus instrusction time, ride there and back was from 10:50am-2:30pm). It says it takes you through jungle paths which lead us all to believe part of it was the actual jungle...don't get your hopes up. It's not. It's the same ranch that offers the horse rides. It was a blast and glad we did it, but it was mostly beach trails. Still loads of fun. I wouldn't advise the horse rides...they seemed really slow and had tons of flies around them. The food that they offered at the end also had tons of flies. We ate big before we went on the trip just in case what they had was not appealing. You sould too just in case. The facilities were nice and the bathrooms were clean. They had a pool to swim in afterwards too which was refreshing after 2 hours of ATVing. If you DO go...here's a heads up...when you get to the \"jungle\" part of the ride which is a short part of it, there is a hidden tree stump at the beginning of the jungle on the far right hand side, just stay left at the beginning of the path and you'll be fine. Don't say I didn't warn you. We took the ferry from Playa Del Carmen to Cozumel one day. $5 taxi ride to town, then $20 per person round trip ferry ride, we rented a convertible VW for $40 total for the entire day. We drove around the island (hour tops with no stops) and stopped many times to play on the beach where the rocks are, also stopped at a great hilltop restaurant/bar called Coconuts. It's a must. Great view and cheap/good food and drinks (very hot salsa). We ate at Poncho's Back Yard in Cozumel. If you are coming off the ferry, it's on the main street there but to the left about 5 blocks. The best food we had on our trip and priced just right too! Great trip and glad we did it. Chichen-Itza was 3 hrs away from RIU Tequila and is an all day affair for $109 US. Tulum & Xel-Ha is 50 minutes south and I was told very crowded 7:30am-5:30pm $109 US Tulum Aquadventure is 90 minutes away, 7:30am-4:30pm $85 US, but we heard it was well worth it. Aquatic Adventure is the \"Yaxmuul\" cave, underground lake, lagoon and ocean snorkeling for $85 US and is only offered once a week from 7:30am-4:30pm. (we were offered Tues, but usually happens on Fridays through Royale Tours) Horseback Riding or ATV...mentioned above, 30 min van ride $63 US, twice daily. Wear bathing suit, tennis shoes, baseball type hat, sunglasses and don't bring bulky bags unless you want to put them in a locker (safe area). If you have some kind of scarf or something to cover your face, bring it, but not necessary, it gets dusty on the roads.. Shower off afterwards by pool if you want. Also you can swim in the large pool. Jungle Tour on Seadoo or 2 person speedboat 9am -3:30pm for $67. Wish we would have done this sounded like people had a blast on this one. We travelled through Vacation Express who is represented locally by Royale Tours. Their website is royaletours if you want to look up more on the excursions they offer. But most tour companies have their own reps that meet you in the lobby with excursion options. This part is very important. A lot of people mentioned that you can get the excursions cheaper in town. In our case, the people offering the cheaper excursions were all timeshare people. There were so many timeshare panhandlers there that it was almost unbearable. Just make sure you know what the \"catch\" is before you sign up with them just to save a buck. You may be wasting most of your day which is not worth saving a few dollars. If you are into the timeshare thing, you will have man y opportunities to find a deal. Okay. I think I told you way more than you ever needed to know, but feel free to email me if you have any questions regarding your trip. I'll do my best to help you out, but know that this is only based on my personal trip.

It was for my mums 50th birthday, Dad was 51, I was 25 and my brother was 16. We had the most amazing holiday, Mum and I went back a year later (just the 2 of us) and I've booking to go again with a friend this year. The rooms were more than we expected with two large beds, large shower, seperate toilet, large wardrobe and plenty of counter space by the bathroom sink. There's 4 optics and a small fridge which are replenished every other day with water, lager, pepsi, fanta orange and whatever you want in the optics (just ask at reception of you want something different. If they've got it, you can have it) and it's all included. The staff were so helpful and friendly. The rooms were cleaned every day and the staff made little towell animals anf left them on the bed. The entertainment staff were excellent. They trained hard every day to make the evening shows as spectacular as possible. This was in addition to the games and activties they did throughout the day (volleyball, shooting, water polo - lots of things). I am aware that the head of entertainment has moved to the Yucatan across the road so I'm not sure if it'll be the same but if not, I'll go accross to the Yucatan to watch the show because you can use the other Riu hotels in the area (except the Palace but who would need to?). The food on offer was awesome, I've never tried steak so tender in my life. My dad still goes on about it now and it's been more than 2 years since he went. Each meal time at the main restaurant, you can see the food being cooked in front of you and put onto serving plates for you to help yourself. There's also the continental breakfast at the poolside bar which is served a little later than the main restaurant if you fancy sleeping in a bit. The weather at that time of year (November) was good on both previous visits. We had the odd downpour but it would be over in a few minutes and the sun would come out and withing half an hour you'd never know it had rained. However, last year (the year we went somewhere else) they had a rather bad hurricane so I'm booking for last week of November and 1st week of December this year just in case. I won't go on and on about the place (I really could)..... if you want any more info, I'd be happy to help e-mail me [--](that's gal not girl).

The rooms were clean and basic. The matresses and pillows were very hard...but OK if you like them like that. Remember to take extra shampoo and conditioner ladies as they provide you with little sachets only. Also realize that this resort is not a beachfront property. You have to take a little golf shuttle or a nice and shady (1mile) walk \"across the street\" to get to the beach. That was never a problem for us as the shuttle ran every 10-15 minutes and the walk is nice. You can spend the day at the Yucatan and Lupita on the beachfront,eat lunch there, swim and so on. This is a very kid friendly resort, so if couples are there to \"relax\" I would recommend the quieter and posher RIU Palace across the street. The one thing that \"shines\" about this resort is the extremely helpful and courteous staff. All in all a wonderful vacation.

The hotel is wonderful and worthy of all of the great reviews. I stayed in room 2152 with my husband and infant daughter and it was a great location - in the back of the property, which was a little far from the main buffet and the beach shuttle, but quiet and with a very pretty view of the golf course in back and the jungle-like trees on the hotel property. We had a 2nd floor corner room which was wonderful because it had an open rail front and side on the balcony, allowing for great breezes and views. I didn't care for the rooms with pool views because everyone could see you sitting on your balcony and there was no privacy. The rooms are pretty basic but perfectly fine. I am very picky about hotel rooms so I was nervous but this was exceptionally clean and spacious enough for all 3 of us. The balconies are large and that really helped make the room nicer. The bathroom was much larger than I thought, with a big closet, ample counter space, a fairly large shower and separate toilet area. Hot water with good pressure. The A/C worked great. The grounds are absolutely beautiful at the Tequila. Large open spaces with winding paths, lots of tropical foliage, and all of the buildings are set back from the common areas and feel very spacious. The pool is wonderful. It is large and never crowded in the water. One side has a whirlpool with the swimup bar and attracts more adults, the other side has the activities and attracts more kids but was equally nice with loungers in the water. They played great music on the activites side all day. While the loungers do get reserved early, we always were able to find something around the pool. However, we preferred the artificial beach area, which is right next to the activities pool and has loungers under a palm tree forest in the sand. You could always find plenty of loungers here at any time of the day and you could move around to be in sun or shade, so it was perfect. This was the best surprise about the Tequila because it felt completely tropical without being on the beach, and when you wanted a drink or something to eat or a swim in the pool you were close by. The food was very good. We did not get sick at all, but we did stay away from salads to be safe. They had much more variety than I had ever seen at a buffet, and in addition to all of the items they set out they had several cook to order stations at every meal. Pancakes were especially good. I am not a buffet lover, but you have to be able to find something you like at every meal. The variety is truly amazing. The main dining room is very pretty and the outdoor terrace is beautiful. Loved eating outside! The only complaint is, surprisingly, the service. The people were extremely friendly at the buffets, but they were always trying to pull plates out from under you while you were eating. Maybe they think this is good service, but I felt like they were just trying to rush us out of there. They were also always closing sections outside an hour before the buffet was over. We would sit at tables and the waiter would rush over and say that that area was closed already. This was annoying, especially with the baby and high chair in tow! They shut the lights out on us one night right as the buffet ended at 10:00 too. That is really my only complaint about this resort though. The beach was amazing - better than I remember 2 years ago. Sand is so soft, no rocks in front of the Yucatan, and water was crystal clear. I had several large fish swim right by me in the shallow area. It does get a little rough in the afternoon, so if you want calm go early in the morning. The waves are nice for body surfing though even in the afternoon - never what I would consider to be unswimmable. The beach shuttle was easy but I liked the walk - it was less than 10 minutes from the lobby and very enjoyable. If you stay in the back of the resort like we did than of course it takes longer to get to the beach. The only thing I missed was being able to walk around the grounds at night and hear and see the ocean. You could head down to the Yucatan at night to do this but it isn't quite the same. However, the tropical feel of the Tequila was wonderful at night too. We went through the Riu Playacar and Yucatan as well. I would stay at the Tequila again, despite not being directly on the beach. The Playacar is small, only six buildings on a grid layout, small unimpressive lobby, decent sized pool for the size of the resort but no lounge chairs ever seemed to be available, and a small beach compared to the Yucatan. The Yucatan just doesn't have a lot of space on the resort. The buildings are also on a grid, all close together. The pool is very crowded and I never saw any lounge chairs, even at 4 in the afternoon. There were usually loungers on the beach though. Not nearly as much shade as at the Tequila (at the Tequila you always had an option of sun or shade, which was nice). The Yucatan pool has more of a party atmosphere, so if you want that than you would probably prefer the Yucatan. We ate breakfast at the buffet one morning and it was not nearly as good. They did not have the variety, no omelets to order, much smaller buffet areas which meant long lines...just more crowded and not as many food options. Most days for lunch we went down to the pool buffet and brought back food to the balcony while my daughter napped. Food seemed much more repetitive here but the guac and chips were always good, and we made tacos with whatever meats or fish they were serving that day. We bought a hammock at the Playacar mall and set it up on the balcony (this probably would only work on the corner rooms). It was wonderful! We did not eat at either of the specialty restaurants. We walked through and saw the meat/fish options displayed for the night, and it just didn't look that appetizing. I preferred the buffet with options. We decided to go into Playa del Carmen 2 nights for dinner to break it up, and had great meals at Yaxche and Media Luna. I recommend going into Playa del Carmen - it had a great party atmosphere in the streets that we enjoyed. If you want a great pool with a tropical atmosphere, great food, and a laid-back kid-friendly resort, this is it. I loved it and only give it a 4 because of the rooms being nothing extraordinary and the rushed service at the restaurants. But it wouldn't stop me from returning!

We've all done the crazy, party 24/7 holiday and really wanted a great, relaxing trip. This is EXACTLY what you get at the Tequila. Of the three RIUS that you have access to, the Tequila is by far, the best. Don't listen to the comments about being a walk away from the beach. Its literally across the street and a nice, welcome reason to move after eating and drinking all day! The Tequila is gorgeous and pristine, with a pool area that is designed to soak up the sun, or snooze in the shade. If you want to head to the beach, I recommend going in the late afternoon as the beachfront RIUS don't have umbrellas and the midday sun can be scorching! Food at the RIU was excellent for resort standards. Lots of variety, fresh and abundant and the staff work tirelessly to make sure that the eating areas are clean and stocked. Breakfast lovers will be in heaven... The rooms are clean, but standard. Our A/C was a bit fussy so we couldn't quite get rid of the moisture in our rooms. At this time of year you can be sure that your clothes will have that sort of damp quality all week long. We took a day trip to Tulum/Xel-Ha, which was ok, although we were a bit disappointed with the large crowds at Xel-Ha. It is marketed as an all natural snorkelling lagoon, but you kind of end up feeling like you are at a big Water Theme Park. Just a heads up... Other than that we literally couldn't complain about a thing.

We went for a week in March 2004 and liked it so much we went back for two weeks in March 2006 as a week just wasn't enough! We booked with Thomson and flew from Birmingham via Manchester. It took 12 hours to get there in total. Its a long flight but worth it when you arrive. The weather was fantastic, it was in the 80's and 90's and we had constant sunshine every day except for one day which was a relief to be honest as it was so hot! The transfer to the Riu Tequila from the airport took an hour and the check in was very quick and organised. The grounds are lovely and we saw loads of butterflies. The room was perfectly adequate. The rooms are not quite five star luxury but the rest of the hotel makes up for that. The beds are hard but that was no problem. The rooms are very clean. We did find a baby lizard in the room on a couple of occasions which wasn't the best for me but my boyfriend likes lizards so he did not see this as a problem and took them back outside. The pool area is great but unfortunately everyone seemed to reserve the sunloungers even though there are signs which tell you not to. We therefore had no choice but to reserve our loungers too or else we would not have been able to get one by the time we reached the pool at say 10am after breakfast. You have to put your towels out at 7am if you want a good spot. Some families reserved 10 loungers together even though we noticed they were never all used! The second week was a lot quieter and it wasn't so much of a problem. There is a wide choice of food at the main buffet at breakfast and of an evening. The quality is very good. We booked in at the beach club and steakhouse for 2 evening meals. The steakhouse was better and the steak I thought was excellent. We ate lunch at the pool restaurant which I always really enjoyed and also the beach club where they do great fish. I did get bored of the evening buffet at times as it was repetitive so we went into Playa Del Carmen three nights for meals out. There are loads of different restaurants in Playa Del Carmen. The ones we chose were all excellent. We had lobster the one night and this was very reasonable. It only takes 5 mins to get there in a taxi and costs 5 dollars or 50 pesos. There are loads of shops there too and it is definitely worth a few visits. (there is also a Mcdonalds!) The only trip we went on was the Dolphin Discovery Cruise to Isla Mjheries with Thomson. It cost $179 each. Swimming with the Dolphins was excellent. We felt Thomson did however describe the trip to be a lot better than it actually was. For example, they don't tell you that when you snorkel with sharks it is basically a snorkel around a plastic shark enclosure. The bike ride to the turtle conservation centre sounded so picturesque but is was basically just a short ride up a straight road from the dolphin centre and you spend about 15 mins looking at baby turtles in tanks. The dolphin swim made the day completely worth it though. We would have been happy just to do that and it is really something everyone should do. We went to Chichen Itza on our holiday there in 2004. Thomson still do the same trip. Be warned it takes 3 hours to get there over a lot of bumpy roads and it is a very long day! The bar service was excellent at the hotel and we spent every night at the bar. The drinks are good too. We also played a lot of pool in the sports bar. If you like pool make sure you stock up on 5 peso coins. It is 6 coins a go and the hotel ran out for a couple of days which was disappointing as we enjoyed to play. We didn't really go in the nightclub as it was always full of 14-16 year olds and felt more like a school disco. They were all drinking alcohol too so I am not sure what the age limit is in Mexico.

Rooms - 3.5 stars, clean, basic amenities but nothing special. Bedspreads in dire need of replacing. Bathroom only seperated by a curtain, no bath only shower. Has a mini bar fridge with water, pop and beer - they replenish every 2 days unless you call for more sooner. Like all the Rius we have stayed at the soap, shampoo etc they provide is AWFUL - bring all your own stuff. Food - 4 stars, good not great but better than many AIs. We only ate at the buffet restaurants (Jalisco and Lupita) as we had a baby and toddler with us. Decent selection but a 5 star selection as rated by Sunquest. Daughter lived off pizza and nacho chips. Pools - 4 stars, nice and big and very kid friendly. The waterfalls were not working and looked like they hadn't for quite some time. On our last day the septic pump backed up and affected the pool so it was closed on one side for the day as was the restaurant - it really smelled awful.

I was very anxious to write a review on Trip Advisor when we returned because the website was so instrumental in helping us to pick the Riu for our week in Playa. I\u2019ll try to be as thorough as I can be and please feel free to email me with any questions you might have. My now wife and I went down to Playa on January 21st with 45 friends and family members and we were married on the beach on January 24th. It was the trip of a lifetime! If you have any concerns about the Riu Tequila, let me put them to rest right now. The place is wonderful. Arrival: The arrival was very smooth and we essentially checked in on the bus transfer on the way to the Riu. When we arrived, our rooms weren\u2019t quite ready for us so the front desk told us to leave all of our luggage in the front with a tag on them for our rooms and go out to explore the grounds. Half of us bellied up to the bar right away, the other half went down to the pool restaurant and pretty much everyone instantly fell in love with the place. Rooms: The rooms were sufficient for what we were looking for. They weren\u2019t huge, but did have all of the amenities. Each room had two double beds pushed together. The beds were rather hard and the pillows were a bit mushy, but it really didn\u2019t bother too many of our guests. If you have room, bring your pillow. We were lucky and flew on Sun Country Airlines so we were able to check two bags totaling 70 pounds each per person. We had room for both of our pillows. A few of our guests had a bit of a musty smell in their rooms. This wasn\u2019t anything unbearable and I think is pretty common in the Caribbean. Ours was fine. The rooms are very clean and were well maintained during the days when we were out and about. We left $2 on the bed for the cleaning staff each day. They refilled our water, Corona and other beverages any time we used them. There is a liquor dispenser right in the room with Gin, Tequila, Rum, and Vodka. The cleaning staff was very good and we were never concerned about our valuables which we locked up in the safe daily. Pools: The pools were great! There were two of them at the Tequila - one for water sports, and the other for swimming or just hanging out. We spent a lot of our time in the pool with the swim-up bar sipping on frozen and mixed drinks, playing cards, and just hanging out with our favorite bartender Victor. The water was cool, but felt great since the sun was so hot. The activities pool had water polo, basketball, aerobics, and probably a lot of other activities that we missed out on. Along the side of the pool there were sand volleyball and outdoor table tennis courts. Beach: The beach was absolutely amazing. I was told that a few years ago Playa was hit by a hurricane and it had a lot of its beach wiped out. Fast forward to October 2005 and Playa found itself with many feet of added beach after Hurricane Wilma had passed. The result was a great place to lay out in the sun and listen to the waves. The waves themselves were rather strong with most of the days having the red flags out. It did make it a lot of fun to body surf. Wilma did leave an awful lot of palm trees lopped off at the top, but that was really the only negative thing we saw in the wake of the Hurricane. The beach itself was about a 10 minute walk or a free tram ride for 6 people away. It was no big deal. I recommend taking a walk down to the beach at sunset on your first night there. It was the perfect way to kick off the trip. The path went right between two other Riu resorts - the Palace and the Yucatan. On the way back from the beach one day I was lucky enough to see about a dozen monkeys (they might have been lemurs, I\u2019m not zoologist). Food: There are 3 restaurant locations at the Riu Tequila. The buffet at the main building was enormous. You can have breakfast, lunch, and dinner at this buffet and if you can\u2019t find something that you like here, you aren\u2019t trying very hard. My wife is a vegetarian and she was very happy eating here often. Their breakfasts were the best with the omelet station being my favorite. One night they had lobster tails on the buffet! The only complaint I heard from any of our guests was the lack of shrimp on the buffet. Otherwise, most were perfectly happy here for every meal. The other buffet was next to the pool and they served lunch up until\u2026well, dinner. This was good, but nothing great. It was perfect if you are just looking for a break to get out of the sun and grab a quick bite. This buffet restaurant by the pool changed in the evening into the Steakhouse. We had our Groom\u2019s Dinner for all 45 people here and most people really enjoyed the food. They have ribs, steak, kebobs, and a few other menu items. I would recommend checking it out once or twice. The third restaurant location is down by the beach and serves seafood. I\u2019m sorry to say that you can feel free to skip this one. The seafood was tough and not all that fresh tasting. The night I went to the seafood place they had the lobster tails at the buffet. I was thoroughly disappointed that I missed out on that. The only good thing about the seafood restaurant is the location. It is perfect for going for a walk on the beach at night after dinner. The two evening a la carte restaurants require a reservation that must be made in the front lobby at 7:00 am in the morning of the dinner. When we went the resort was at capacity and the reservations were gone each morning within 20 minutes or so. Trust me, the buffet restaurant is better than a consolation to the a la cartes anyways. There was also the sports bar that had snacks anytime you want them with nachos, and burgers and hot dogs ready to be warmed in the microwave. These are simply munchies and serve their purpose well. Excursions: There are plenty of things to do in the Playa and surrounding area if you want to get off the resort property once in a while. About 20 of us went to Xel-ha, which I would definitely recommend. There was snorkeling, tubing, cliff jumping, hiking, and swimming with the dolphins. There a place out at the end of the path leading to the ocean that is exactly what heaven on earth looks like. 6 hammocks 30 feet from the water with a warm breeze and the sound of the waves crashing on the rocks. I want to go back there\u2026now. Other people in our group went to Xcaret, Coba, and Tulum. A good time was had by all. We had the option of Lomas Travel and Apple Vacations to buy the excursions from in the main lobby. They are there every day. The town of Playa is a great place to shop and hang out in the nightlife scene and is only a $5 cab ride away. We went to Carlos and Charlie\u2019s one night and they were crazy. Senior Frogs was renovating when we were there (Wilma\u2018s aftermath). The Blue Parrot burned to the ground on the day before we got there. That sucked for us since we were supposed to have 45 people go there for our wedding dinner 3 days after arriving in Mexico. We rolled with it though and the resort bent over backwards for us and gave us a wonderful semi-private dinner on the patio of the buffet restaurant. We were very grateful. Miscellaneous: This will be a hodgepodge of things. One of the best things we found about the Riu Tequila was that you can use the facilities of all of the Riu resorts (other than the Palace), but you pay the least since you are not staying right on the beach. We used the beaches, pools, bars, swim-up bars, and restaurants at both the Playacar and the Yucatan in addition to the Tequila. It was great. I would recommend the Playacar the most as it had a great swim-up bar and the best lunch buffet with a make-your-own pasta bar. This got packed up later so get there early if you want to try it. Dinner always has to be at your home resort, but that was fine with us. There was a guy in the lobby that rolled cigars every night, he was a genius. The cigars were so tasty if you are into that type of thing. The shows didn\u2019t really appeal to me, but some of our guests enjoyed them. The performers tried hard, but they weren\u2019t exactly Broadway quality shows. I guess we weren\u2019t on Broadway so what do you expect? The staff was excellent - polite and friendly whether you tipped or not. We did. Please do. A few dollars a day means an awful lot to them and not much to us. Bring an insulated mug. We gave out 23 ounce mugs to all of our guests and it was an enormous hit. The bartenders are happy to fill them up and you don\u2019t have to make so many trips to the bar. The disco smelled really bad but they played great music and there usually was a good crowd. Wedding: Our wedding was a fairytale. We went with an independent wedding coordinator and we were glad we did. Our setting was perfect and we were really without a worry. We were brought to a private beach by vans and the ceremony was all planned out for us. The cost was a little higher, but not much considering the number of people we had. Email me if you want to know more information about the coordinator we used. We have a few pictures attached. The weddings at the Riu resorts that we saw were fine if you are looking for something very simple. We would have been disappointed since they were anything but private. All of our guests really appreciated the private beach and were very impressed by our wedding over the ones at the resort. To each their own, but if you are planning to get married in Playa, I\u2019d love to share what I know. Our coordinator made our day absolutely perfect and I want to spread the word about her. Feel free to contact me at calsprowls@yahoo.com. I know that was really long, but if you are anything like me, I really appreciated the thorough reviews before we went to Playa. Have a great time and book the Tequila with confidence. We will definitely be going back there again in the future.", "Date": "March 22, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, Canada", "Title": "\u201cHad a great time\u201d", "Author": "BabsBets", "ReviewID": "UR4724519", "Content": "We are a family of 3, in our late 40's with a 19 year old daughter. We have never been to an all inclusive and must say we enjoyed it. The resort was very nice, the room smelt a little musty as we stayed on the ground level. I took some fabrize with us and other couples we spoke with took scented candles. I get sinus headaches from dust mites and did not experience any here. The beds were hard but they did not seem to bother our sleep. We thought we would just go to Wal Mart and buy a foam pad if we found them too uncomfortable. The pool was awesome and there were plenty of chairs and shaded areas. The swim up bar was great as were the bar staff. Hola! They serve some shots...Scoobie Doo's that had a kick to them. The food was great some days and ok others. Lots to choose from. The Steak House was disappointing but nice for a change. We should have tried the surf and turf as oppose to the steak. It got great reviews. We went on the golf cart to the beach which runs daily. I have difficulty walking but the walk for most would be enjoyable. The beach was ok but not alot of shade. The first few days it was so windy no one went to the beach and the activities on the beach were not running...surf sail, sea doo's, etc. We were up at 7:00 am everyday to put our towels out and reserve our chairs by the pool. There were lots of chairs even if you got up late just not in the shady areas. We enjoy just relaxing and reading on our holiday and this was perfect. We met many wonderful people and had great fun. Our daughter and her friend found the Tequila a little slow for their liking. They went to the disco every night but found the majority of the people there between 14 and 16 years old. They took a trip to Cancun with a tour company to hit the spring break bar scene and loved it. The tour guide stayed with them, got their drinks and partied with them. They went to one bar that held 6000 people and thought it was the best. They have decided to return in a couple years and stay in Cancun where the parties are. Overall this was a great vacation. You could use the facilities at the other Riu hotels but the Tequila was just right for us. Many of the guest that stayed at the Riu Palace ended up at bar at the Tequila to see the entertainment and go to the disco (open until 3 am) or sports bar (open 24 hours). They have white arm bands at the Palace and the Tequila has a beige colour band. You are not allowed in the Riu Palace across the street (only the Yucatan and Playacar) however, we were told by some people who have stayed at the Tequila for 3 years in a row, to turn our arm band inside out to reveal the white side. The Palace was very classy and beautiful. Not what we were looking for.

The Rui Tequila is a beautiful resort with all the makings for a wonderful vacation. Here are some random thoughts that you might want to consider when booking your vacation...... Food: Above average for an all inclusive. The buffet has plenty of variety and the quality is quite good. There are only 2 al a carte restarurants and 1 is at the Yucatan (5-7 min walk). The steak house is not so good, I preffered the buffet, but it's a welcomed change. The Mediterrainean was quite good, definately worth getting up early for. Around the pool activities: If you are looking for a fun filled, activity packed day, you will have to do just that....look for it. Although there are things going on such as Volleyball, Archery and Dance Lessons, the activity staff doesn't do a great job at promoting it. You are best to look on the board in the lobby at breakfast or you will likely miss them. I did not go with kids, but they seemed to have a good kids program where they were kept busy and entertained. Day Trips: We went to Xel-Ha for the day. It was nice to get out of the resort for something different, but a bit expensive for what you get. If you have kids it would be a great trip. The snorkling is in one area with tons of people and only one or two kind of fish (big ones) but the wow factor is over in about 10 mins. There caves are nothing to see and the food is ok. The Lazy River is nice and relaxing, but if you don't have perfect weather it would be a drag. If you want a great day trip take the ferry over to Cozumel and rent scooters. This is not a tour, you can do it on your own. The scooters are $25-$30 for the day and there is lots to do. If you drive along the coast there are private beaches. I suggest Paradise Beach. Great food, great music and the beach is beautiful. Pool and Beach: The Pool is beautiful and there is always chairs avaiable. The swim up bar and the restaurant are in the middle of it which is nice and convienient. The walk to the beach is not even worth mentioning unless you want to be there everyday and come back and forth to your room. It's actually a nice stroll. Misc: The rooms are very average, but clean and spacious. The beds are not so comfortable. The staff is friendly and helpful. The disco was fun, but doesn't get up and going until about 12:00am. The sports bar was nice, but the pool tables, air hockey and video games are expensive. All and all it was a nice resort. Not a place to go if you are looking to party it up or be on the go 24/7, but you can always find something to do...or just relax and no one will bother you. I have been to about 8 all inclusive resorts and of them all I would return to this one first.", "Date": "March 10, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Milwaukee, Wisconsin", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful place, great value for money\u201d", "Author": "PTG1002", "ReviewID": "UR4590021", "Content": "First - the group: 6 people total, one married couple age 28&30, 4 singles: 31, 40, 41, 44. We all like to drink, have fun, etc - so we're looking for an active environment. Transfer at the Cancun airport (through Funjet Vacations) was smooth, though point of fact - do not take a luggage cart as they CANNOT go outside. People were taking off their luggage from the carts and just letting them hang around, clogging up the only exit. Once outside, we found our Funjet guy and went to the \"funjet area\" to grab our transfer. Another tip - pay the extra money for the quick transfer. There was a huge line of people (100+) waiting for their group transfer to the hotel, we moved right in front of everyone to get our van and transfer to PDC. Arrived at the Riu - first impressions - eh, this looks nice! Open concept for the main checkin area with tiles all around. When raining (or people that are dripping from the pool, etc) the tiles DO get slick, no matter the shoes you are wearing. Check-in was painless, we were met with light drinks, and were off to the rooms. A mild mildewy-smell came from the rooms - they are 2 to a \"bunch\" in the sections, and there is a 10ft hallway that leads to the 2 rooms. One light, easily illuminated the area. Room itself has 2 full beds - we were unable to get a room with just one bed (told there were no such rooms) and the beds were SUPER hard. Pillows were ok. Bathroom area was clean, well-kept, and without bugs or mildew. Closet area was ample w/ hangers. Balcony was nice (we overlooked a courtyard) - but the walls are low so if people are next to you, they can hear you and vice versa. Pool area - very nice, clean, well-kept. Only complaint is that little children were proliferant in the area despite the \"kids only\" pool in the back. A lot of horseplay that got some patrons wet. Pool bar was top-notch, though it does remain in the shade so don't plan on staying there if you want more sun! The food was ok - we ate mainly in Jalisco (which is the main dining room upon entry to the Riu Tequila) for breakfast and dinner, the Lupita (pool restaurant) for lunch. Buffet style for both - lots of choices with normal \"American\" style food (hamburgers, hot dogs, etc), salad, and some Mexican choices as well. Food was what I would expect for a buffet - edible, somewhat tasty, but not fantastic. We also had a chance to eat at the \"Steak restaurant\" (Which is in the Lupita at night) as well as the Meditteranean Restaurant over at the Riu Yucatan another night. Both require reservations and fill up FAST!!! Food definitely increased a notch and was fantastic, though service was very, very slow. Not enough waiters for either meal, they all were covering a lot of tables. We also noted that there were even less waiters that spoke English during these meals - as I speak Spanish, this wasn't too much of a problem, but if you didn't speak any this could be a problem. The weather held out for the most part - we had two days where it was cloudy and rained for 45min (rained HARD!!) but hey, it's Mexico, who cares!? Very sunny. You use towel cards to get your pool towels - they are not very giving with the towels and actually give you a hard time if you want to \"Exchange\" them on a same-day basis. You will need the cards though when you check-out!! Bar areas are nice - although bar selection is a little waning. They have the \"main\" liquors - vodka, rum, tequila, and gin - but anything else and you'll have problems finding it. Very friendly staff no matter where you go. The beach is about a 5min walk away - there is a paved path between the Riu Palace and the Riu Yucatan (which is also lit at night). Easy enough walk, but they also run little golf carts that hold up to 7 people back and forth from the Tequila to the beach if you want. We never found a lack of chairs to lie on the beach. You do, however, find a plethora of people coming around asking if you want to go snorkeling, parasailing, jetskiing, etc - which all, of course, adds extra cost. We didn't have a chance to do any of those excursions. Overall a great vacation.

I don't think that anyone would be disappointed in this hotel. We enjoyed the expansive grounds and were actually glad that we stayed there as opposed to the two sister properties on the beach, the Playacar and the Yucatan. (We were able to use the restaurants during the day and the bars at these properties.) The walk to the beach took a little more than five minutes, down a partially shaded walkway. There was a golf cart, but I can't imaging that you would need it unless you had small children. We appreciated the spread out blocks of hotel rooms and the gardens at the RIU as opposed to the closer quarters at the other properties. Our room was quite a distance from the reception and lobby, in a quiet location, which we appreciated. The beach was lovely, light colored sand and aqua blue water. We never had difficulty finding a lounge chair in the palm forest at the edge of the beach. It was occasionally difficult to find a chair at the pool at the RIU. Many rise early and stake our their territory. We could find chairs if we reserved some by ten or in the late afternoon when we returned from the beach. We were new to all inclusives and had some trepidation, but the food was quite good. We ate at the speciality steak restaurant one night, which was decent and a treat because you were waited on. The buffet was in a very large dining room that we found a bit overwhelming as a couple. We liked sitting outside because it was quieter. Being new to all inclusives, we didn't realize that the waiters would bring us our drinks and we just had to serve ourselves from the buffet. There were numerous choices, you couldn't possibly sample everything in one week. The best advice I had was from this site. Someone advised not to try to sample numerous dishes every night, but to decide what type of meal you want and choose accordingly. That helped avoid the tedium of a buffet.The rooms at the Tequila were not luxurious, but were spotlessly clean and in good repair. We enjoyed sitting on the balcony in the evening as the sun went down.

To be honest, even though only one year has passed since we were there I was nervous going back somewhere that I remember as being so excellent. Seems I had nothing at all to worry about! Staff still helpful and friendly - no problem with a room change (I prefer being upstairs). Maid service excellent, mini bar still filled every two days (leave a note and a tip to get the drinks you prefer). Pool area hasn't changed, a bit less foliage due to hurricane damage but the team of gardners are constantly tending it and planting new things. No problems getting a lounger by the pool or the beach. One of the biggest changes this year is the fact that you don\u2019t get a table for your evening meal allocated for the whole of your stay. We weren't keen on this but it still works - I just had to leave something on the table to find my way back to it as you can't always sit in the same area each time unless you specifically ask. The food was still good although I didn\u2019t think there was as much choice as last year - there was still enough to choose from though. They started doing pasta at a station (think omelette station type thing!) while we were there. You choose your pasta and then ham, onion, tomato etc and it\u2019s heated and put in with your sauce (always tomato I saw). I kind of liked the four pasta choices they used to have so was a bit miffed at this - the queue for pasta was also quite lengthy at times! The cakes are still yuk (in my opinion) but there was still loads of ice cream, and churros/pancakes/fritters etc. The evening shows are pretty much the same although the animation team is slightly smaller so there seemed to be a few more shows by dance groups from outside the hotel (the calypso one was dreadful - I\u2019ve never seen so many dancers out of time with each other!). The shows done by the team were by far the best, although the Mayan show was still very good. There will still some of the team from last year which was nice to see. The usual daytime entertainment - the paper plane competition was hilarious (especially when one ended up behind the person throwing it!). The new Sports Bar is great, really big and lots of Tvs, pool tables, air hockey and some video games. The internet is also in there. There are two big fridges with hamburgers, hot dogs, pizza and fruit in them. You just put whatever you want in the microwave. They also have chips and that orange cheesy sauce stuff! It seemed quite popular with people wanting to drink on past 12 but not go into the disco, and on returning from town late at nights the pizza was VERY welcome! Service at the bars was good - although the Maguey bar (nearest the sports bar) was easiest to get served at in the evening. I did however have a few undrinkable cocktails where an ingredient had obviously been left out! At least with AI you can just leave it and get another\u2026 The gym (at the Yucatan) was still bad despite them adding a new treadmill, cross trainer and two new bikes.

Rather than repeating too many of them, we'll make a few observations and suggestions: LOCATION: It's not on the beach, but that really doesn't matter. It's a 10-minute stroll on a private walkway to get there (good way to work off all the great food!), or a three-minute ride on the shuttle that runs continuously. The beach wasn't crowded, there were plenty of lounges available, and the sand is soft and white. For a great beach walk, turn right and keep going! Lunch, snacks and drinks are available at the Tequila's beach facility and at the Riu Yucatan too. FOOD: We ate at the buffet almost all the time because we liked it so much. We did try the steakhouse once and enjoyed it (no problem getting a reservation), but we preferred the variety at the buffet. The main dining room (Jalisco) has an amazing variety of food - you could eat several different things every meal over the course of a two-week stay and not have the same food twice. A few tips: Try the made-to-order omelettes at breakfast; the crispy bacon is to die for; don't overlook the home-baked breads and buns or the extensive salad bar; the official opening time for dinner is 6:30 pm, but it really opens by about 6:15; there is no reserved seating and the two sitting times are no longer in effect; Clemente (at dinner) is an exceptionally attentive, friendly and competent waiter with old-world manners - his area is on an near the outdoor patio; also look for Justina (a tiny young woman) at breakfast; save room for the wonderful ice cream - the strawberry is especially good and so is the chocolate sauce. Lunch at the Lupita has an amazing variety of good foods - try the french fries, pizza, pastas, and the soft ice cream. Overall, the food was fresh and delicious and both of us gained several pounds. ROOMS: Very clean, beds a bit hard but no big deal; nice balcony; minibar well stocked; and items like t-shirts that are rinsed out and hung on the balcony drier will dry quickly in the daytime sun, so no need to overpack. We had only one rainy day in two weeks, but there is a big umbrella in each room - a thoughtful touch! DRINKS: The bartenders are friendly and efficient (look for Cruz at the Kiosko Bar); we especially enjoyed the Miami Vices, Tequila Sunrises, Melon Balls, Blue Oceans, and of course the BOOM BOOMS! Definitely enough booze in the drinks! The draft Corona is refreshing on a hot day. FIFTH AVENUE: It's an interesting half-hour walk away, with some free ruins, interesting homes, and other hotels to see along the way. Otherwise plenty of taxis available for a five-buck ride. TIPPING: We were disappointed to see that so many people didn't seem to be tipping the staff, even when they were making special requests. Yes, we know gratuities are included in the AI package, and yes, we know that the service will be friendly and efficient with no tips, but would it hurt to give out the occasional dollars or 20 or 50 peso notes to the servers, bartenders, room attendants, and others??? SERVICE: Check-in and check-out were so fast and painless they could be timed in seconds rather than minutes. Every staff person we encountered was friendly and helpful; \"holas\" every day from virtually all of them- they really seem to like their jobs! - and management constantly checked to make sure we were satisfied. We also noticed how hard the staff worked at their jobs and they were immaculately dressed and groomed. Would we return to Riu Tequila? In a heartbeat! Do we recommend it highly?

Amazing vacation this year it was wonderful,would recommend this resort, to anyone if you are interested in a classy,Family Oriented resort at a rating of 5 in my eyes it should rate a 5+. FOOD: was very tasty and plenty to choose from at any given time. DRINKS: different varieties and tried alot of different ones and were very tasty.Dont forget to try the Mexican coffee they are really good its with Tequila and ice cream,Yummy,oh yes the Strawberry Daiquiris too...... ENTERTAINMENT: Alot of energy and very entertaining in every way. SERVICE: 1st class from the lobby to the beach. Anyone who is travelling with children the best place,never came across a child that wasnt happy there,the Animation Team where good at keeping the children entertained. The only complaint I had is with the Steakhouse,the food was not good neither was the service,they need improvement at that a la carte restaurant,we went there for Valentine's Day expecting for it to be special and romantic with a little bit of decor,but nothing,disappointed.The Guests that had dinner in the dinning room were treated to a Rose and that made it special for them.I guess we made the wrong choice,for that Romantic night. Felt very safe there at all times,they spoke good English cause our Spanish is not up to par,but we did our best. Beaches: beautiful and clean,the only thing I would suggest is DONT go into the Ocean with your prescription or sun glasses,cause the Ocean loves to take them from you,the waves are fearst,the colors of the ocean is breathtaking and we were told,that the Caribbean Sea has 7 colors of Blue and trust me there is.We had no problem with Bugs or Sand Flies. Conlusion: our Trip was amazing,the Staff at the Resort were very friendly and helpful at any given time.I would definetly have no problems staying there for 2 weeks cause their is lots to do.We took in the Xcaret excusion it was good, alot of walking, if you are planning to do this excusion, bring a good pair of shoes,your feet will thank you. If you like Shopping take a Taxi only $5.00 and go to Fifth Avenue lots of shopping there and if you choose to walk it its 40-45minutes.

We had originally booked at the Riu Lupita but were upgraded to the Tequila the day before our departure. We arrived at the hotel very late at night and were greeted by friendly staff at the front desk who quickly got our paperwork processed so that we could get some much needed rest. As we walked to our room, we could tell, even in the dark, that the grounds were very well kept, the pool was beautiful, and that the many two-story hotel buildings were nicely layed out. We found our room and after a quick inspection found it to be more than satisfactory, with ample space, two double beds that were pushed together to give the effect of one huge king-size bed, a mini-bar and fridge, and patio doors to a small terrace that looked out on a well maintained garden area. Everything was spotlessly clean. We were pleased and decided to hit the sack, anticipating a great stay in paradise. In the morning we we awoke to a glorious cacophony of bird calls just ouside our room. It was just past 7am and we felt thouroughly refreshed after only a few hours of sleep on the comfortable bed. The birds were singing, the sun was shining and we were ready to go find some breakfast. As we walked to the dining hall, each of the hotel staff that we met greated us with a friendly \"hola!\" as they went about their morning chores. We marvelled at the beautiful tropical trees and flowers and were surprised to see a number of large iguanas sunning themselves along the cobblestone walking path. In the dining hall, we found a great variety of food. We filled our plates three times and wished we could have gone back for more, but our bellies wouldn't hold any more. The wait staff was prompt and courtious and all spoke at least enough english to make themselves understood. After breakfast, we exchanged some of our canadian money into pesos at the front desk. The exchange rate was good, but not as good as we would find later in Playa del Carmen. We returned to our room to get our beach gear and were surprised to find that Elizabeth, our housekeeper had already been there and done an impeccable job of cleaning up. We were impressed. We took the shuttle cart to the beach (about a 3 minute drive down a private, covered path) and found it to be beyond our expectations. It was clean, the sand was white and the sea was a beautiful blue-green. The Riu Yucatan beach club was right there too, complete with buffet service, pool and swim-up bar, and beach toys like boogie boards, sail-boats, etc. There were lots of loungers, both on the sand and around the pool. We stayed at the beach for a few hours before I decided that I needed a hat to keep the sun off of my bald head, so we headed up the steet to a small group of stores at the Playacar. I purchased a nice hat for what I thought was a fair price (I would later see the same hat on 5th avenue in Playa del Carmen for 1/3 the price). The Playacar area was beautiful and growing. There was a fair bit of constuction going on. As well, there was some hurricane damage that had yet to be cleaned up. Later, we went back to the hotel and soaked up our share of paradise on the beach. After dark, we dressed up a bit and went to the dining hall for dinner. We were greated by tuxedo-clad wait staff and were escorted to our table. The buffet food was excellent with a variety of flavours and once again we stuffed ourselves. After dinner, we had a few drinks from the bar and stayed to watch the evening show, which was not very good on this particular night, but they got much better as the week went on. The Mayan show, mid-week, was first rate. As you can probably tell, we had a fantastic time at the Riu Tequila, and this was just the first day, with each day thereafter being just as good or better. Consistently, the hotel staff and services impressed us. We made reservations at the steak house one night late in the week and wished we had done so earlier, as the food was excellent. During our trip we had a couple of days with abnormally cool temperatures, when laying on the beach or by the pool was not something we could do for very long, but we always found something entertaining to do. We went to the Mayan ruins at Tulum, which was excellent, with a gorgeous beach on site as an added bonus. In my opinion, a must-see. We also went to Xel-Ha nature park which was an amazing experience. For me it was the highlight of the whole vacation. To say that we enjoyed our stay at the Riu Tequila would be a gross understatement. We were impressed from the first day to the last and we are already making plans to have our wedding and honeymoon on the Riviera Maya next year.", "Date": "February 20, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "toronto, ontario", "Title": "\u201cGreat food, activities not so great\u201d", "Author": "toronto289", "ReviewID": "UR4465821", "Content": "I did not actually stay at the tequila myself, but i stayed at the playacar.

The rooms have a mini-bar that is restocked every 2nd day. The rooms have a shower only. The only complaint with the room is that we found the beds extremely hard. We took in one tour during our stay; the Coba Adventure Tour. We booked it through our Sunquest Rep. It was $109 US. Excellent tour if you're adventurous!!:) Not a tour for families with young children, or if you have some physical problems as you repell down a cliff and use a zip-line to cross a river. The hotel is not on the beach but don't let this stop you from booking. The shuttle runs every 5 minutes or you can walk over to the beach which is a short 10 minute walk. The beach is shared with the Riu Yucatan. There are plenty of loungers for everyone. Playa del Carmen is a 2km walk from the hotel or a $5 US cab ride.

The location of the Riu Tequila is across the street from the Riu Palace and Riu Yucatan Hotels. It is necessary to walk down an arched hallway of flowers to the beach, approx. 1 block. The beach area is shared by the Riu hotels. It is magnificent, with white sand and towering palms trees. Lounge chairs are provided at no cost. You can walk directly from the beach to the Yucatan pool which has a swim up bar. They have a lovely picnic type restaurant with a thatched roof that is convenient for lunch. The Riu Palace is more up-scale and is lovely. We attended a family wedding there. We feel the Riu Tequila is a better value, but for those who prefer to a beach location, the Riu Yucatan would be another good choice. Entertainment is provided at each hotel nightly. There is also a mini mall of shops and local entertainment is sometimes an activity at the store front. The shops are reasonable and enjoyable. If you feel like a nice walk, the town of Play Del Carmen is approx. 1 mile from the hotel. Taxi service is also available. They have shops and restaurants and is nice to visit.

We were delighted to find we were staying in the Tequila as we were given an option of 3 - this one, the Playacar or the Yucatan & this was our first choice.

On arrival at the hotel we were stunned at the reception area - very breathtaking. Check in is very quick as you fill in all the forms on the bus from the airport so all you have to do is pick up your keys & leave your luggage to be brought by the bell boys. Room was very basic & did smell musty but it was clean & it was nice having a mini bar & optics included & not having to pay for safe deposit box either. The grounds are kept lovely & soon tidied up after a rain storm which we unfortunately had a few of whilst there but mainly at night (luckily a brolly is provided in your room) - staff are really friendly & always saying \"Hola\". The pool areas are excellent but still people insist on saving their sunbeds!!! The restaurant was tremendous & you would be hard pushed to find something you didn't like - waiters very attentive & happy to help. The bars staff were very efficient & you were served within a minute of arriving at the bar with a plesant smile & hello (past experiences of all inclusives you have to wait an age to be served). It was lovely to order any drink you wanted on the all inclusive & no cocktails were extra. We are beach lovers but it didn't matter that the beach was 10 mins stroll away it was a good way of working off the food & cocktails - although we stayed round the pool more as it was quite windy on the beach. All in all we are hoping to return next Feb for 2 weeks with our children who we believe will have a great time. P.S.

We were both delighted with the decision. Our deal (\u00a3600 each for 1 week from London All Inclusive) was based on a stay at one of three Riu hotels in Cancun or Playacar. We were both slightly dissapointed that we weren't in Cancun but a few days later we were so glad we ended up where we did. The location of the Riu Tequila is perfect. Nestled in the luxury resort of Playacar it's a few minute walk to the stunning beach or a 10/15 minute stroll to the bustling & brilliant Playa del Carmen. If you have your heart set on staying in a beach hotel, please bear in mind that the vast majority of hotels here are set back from the beach so it's extremely unlikely you will get any sort of beach-view. Most \"beach\" hotels are set in low lying blocks dotted throughout the dense grounds & the walk from our room at the Tequila was only a short while longer than say the Yucatan which is wet against the beach. Hotel lay-out is beautiful. Huge open plan reception area branchiing out into tropical,shaded walkways around a massive & well-themed pool area. Rooms are contained in two-story blocks with large clean rooms with a separating curtain between the bathroom area. The fridge is re-stocked daily with lots of Corona, Coke, Sprite etc and 4 large bottles of spirits are available for your consumption free of charge ! Expect to come across the odd iguana or 10 throughout your stay as we seen in excess of a dozen in the space of a week. Bats were also everywhere once the sun went down which was very early in the day. The food in the restaurants was incredibly varied & excellent quality. The relaxed atmosphere was perfect as although easy-going it was never noisy ot too hectic. Drinks throughout the hotel bars were all branded and extremely well presented. It was a pleasant walk to the great little town of Playa del Carmen which consists of all manner of shops, bars & restaurants ranging from cheap and cheerful to very classy. Both me and my girlfriend loved strolling through it's very long main street by night as the atmosphere was buzzing. We never felt uneasy despite their being a strong local presence - just the right combination of tourists & locals. We decided to eat in the town twice at night & the food we sampled in the traditional restaurant was exceptional. Despite being advised by our rep not to, we done a deal with a taxi driver to take us upto Cancun & it was great value for money. It was approx $30 for an hour taxi ride which took us exactly where we wanted to go. It was worth a day trip to check out the shopping centres, Hard Rock Cafe, Rainforest Cafe, etc but we were very glad we weren't staying there. The shops were all very similar and no real brand names or stores like we wrongly anticipated. Our day trip to Xcaret was a brilliant day out. Again, avoid the rep's advice and just hop in a taxi for the short ride & pay at the gate. A beautifully laid out natural theme/eco park which ended with a spectacular show in a stunning arena which Disney would have been proud of. Instead of doing what most people do when they arrive, avoid swimming in the rivers until later in the day. By afternoon most people have already done that which leaves the under-ground inlets, grottos etc almost deserted and much more fascinating. At times however it was only me and my partner swimming through near pitch-black caves which made for a pretty creepy time !!! Had to swim a few feet over a Moray Eel toward the end which was much scarier though !!! What an experience overall.

THANKS A BUNCH!!!! Anyway as far as the RIU Tequila goes what can I say it is a very good example of a RIU clubhotel. It might not be on the beach, don't let this put you off if you have children as there is a nice (but small) childrens area with a good kids pool, two slides, couple of swings and a rope swing, which is all surrounded by sand that kept my 3 year old and the friends he made happy and there were plenty of older children happy to play here too. This is also where the kids club house is, the children are supposed to be four to be left but younger children where allowed to partake in activities if accompanied by parents or older siblings. Moses the main childrens rep managed to keep all the kids ammused for two hours every morning and afternoon - he definatly deserves a mention for this fact. We stayed in the RIU mambo in Dom Rep NOV 2004 and the childrens facilities were no comparision to the tequila. The evening entertainment was the same as in all the Rius for the kids with the dancing and then the animation team put on spectacular shows. We actualy only stayed at the tequila for 10 nights of our 14 night holiday as the hotel was over booked so we took an option to move to the RIU Cancun. This is by no means any reflection on the rooms, service or food of the Tequila it was purely cause we thought it would make a nice change for the last four nights to try Cancun. My only real niggle with the tequila was that more often than not the food was cold at the buffet, I know this is a difficult one as if you keep the food too warm it will over cook! But hey. Oh one more thing is that the sports bar was showing english football so you don't have to miss out. I took a thomson trip to Chichen Itza this was a long day. It took four hours to get there we then had a 1 1/2 hour guided tour, a hour to look around ourselves, then a hour in a restaurant for lunch - nothing special, but edible - and then three hours on the coach back. It was a long day and I really regret not asking how much it was to fly there and back as I actual thought after it probably wouldn't be that much more. Having said that when they say you go on a luxury coach it did have a lot more legroom than yo might expect, I think it can seat 34 passangers instead of the usual 50.

Palace was a nicer Hotel but the Food at the Tequila was better. The buffet was HUGE with tons of selection and very well prepared dishes. They even had an outdoor Bar B Que night with ribs, chicken and steak. Rooms were 3 star at best, a bit out dated and drab compared to the Palace, but then again the Tequila is not the Palace. The pool was large, but cold. The beach is a good 10 minute walk or you can take the shuttle. The grounds were nice but not lush and green like the Riu's in the Dominican. Staff were eager to please and the entertainment although not Vegas calibre was very good. Mayan and Playa is in great shape, no evidence of Hurricane damage unlike Cancun, which we were shocked to discover has only 12 out of 155 hotels operational, avoid Cancun. Mayan was the place to be! The snorkelling in Cozumel I am sad to say was very disapointing, after a 20 minute stomach turning ferry ride($12US per person each way) the 3 reefs we visited had little or no coral reef left due to the hurricane, lots of fish but no bright colored coral or plant life. Beware the time share sharks! We did attend and did get $400 in free tours but they do waste your entire day, so be sure to make it worth your while in free tours. Tours can be purchsed down the street from the Tequila in the Plaza for 50% or better than what the Travel Reps at the hotel offer again usually offered by a time share rep, just refuse the timeshare presentation and you can still buy the tours for half price. Playa is worth a trip or two, only a 30 minute walk or a $5 cab ride, tons of shops and restraunts, be prepared to haggle and only pay half. Rented a scooter from the Tequila ($29 US for 3 hours) to go to playa, not for the faint of heart, traffic and one way streets can be tricky. Be sure to BUY your booze/sunscreen/postcards/underwater cameras at WALMART in Playa much cheaper, $9 US for Kaluha and $6 for Tequila. Suscreen at the market in PLaya or Hotel shops can be as much as $20 US vrs $6-7 at walmart. All in all a very nice Hotel, we stayed at the Riu's in Dominican last Jan and ended up with Norwalk so we were offered a voucher from Sunquest, we did pay about $2000 on top of the Dominican Voucher to go to the Tequila, so I would probably return to the Riu Bachata or Merengue and save $2000 as they were as good as the Tequila in terms of Rooms/Food ect. (As long as Norwalk is not present). The Mayan was great, Tequila excellent but bang for your buck if you can stay at the Riu's in Dominican and save a few thousand I would have to go that route and you are also right on the beach with good snorelling. If you want the shopping/nightlife ect then the Mayan Riveria will not dissapoint, and if you like to go off Resort the Dominican is not as nice as the Mayan.

They then understood the one hour of cold I had to endure due to the HOURS of heat til they got to change. We got to the Riu got our bracelets, key and lock for safe. Found our room and loved it. As soon as we had popped the tops of the Coronas got a phone call from the front desk asking if everything was fine. Went to find our wfv rep to get the paper you need to go home and last minute questions and we were off to the beach to catch the last of sunlight. We were soo suprised with everything. Have been at 5 other All-Inc this is by far the best(Flamingos, Jack Tar, Golden Crown, Blue Bay Getaway and El Manderin) The bartenders , Maids, Entertainment, Groundkeeping were the best. Not once did we find andybody rude. The only weird thing was having to pay 60 pesos to play pool and all the other games in the sports bar(other places include them for free) Went into town twice and having been to playa del carmen twice we noticed right away the damage from the hurricane. Went to go to Senor Frogs and it is a cement platform, we had found a very good place called El Chino and couldn't find it(left chickmaps map in Colorado) Found El Taberna for all directv football games and great prices. My son became one of the entertainment staff as they knew him by name and hung out with him(he's 11) He knew ther schedules by heart. Wanted to go up to Cancun for the day and we couldn't(roads closed unless you were staying at one of the resorts) Did Xel-ha and found it great, having been there before also we found the lack of crowds the best(no waiting in line) We floated down the river and were surprised to see all the pathes have been paved(last time it was sand/rocks and you had to carry your shoes everywhere. The river is supposed to be where you can float DOWN it, but do to the winds we had to paddle our butts off to get back to the end point.(needed the exercise anyway) Noticed a LOT less fish, but that is probably due to the hurricane. Didn't do the combo with Tulum due to the fact it takes 2 hour out of being a Xel-ha and in winter the sun goes down quick. The rest of the time was just relaxing during the day on the beach and at night watching the shows. The restaurants are all GOOD, did the Steak house twice but not the Mediterain(sp?) Many selections and not even the Pickest eater could complain(if they do they complain at EVERTHING, and can't be pleased) Hats off to this wonderful resort we WILL be back", "Date": "January 23, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Midland, MI", "Title": "\u201cSecond time there & can't wait to go back....\u201d", "Author": "Scarolann", "ReviewID": "UR4371952", "Content": "Once again we had a marvelous time at the Riu Tequila!!

We went with 6 of our friends and that in itself made an awesome vacation. The place was beautifully upkept, the staff were always friendly-ola, ola, ola! We always left meals very full, and the selection was great. Most of us came down with the mayan revenge for one day and we believe it was the fruit at the Riu Yucatan. The drinks were good and the bartenders were quick and friendly. Our favorites were: Blue Ocean, Miami Vice, Daquaris, margaritas, mai tai's, and bahama mama's. Our advice to anyone going is to bring a big cup! We did the extreme mayan adventure tour and it was very good. We got to do a zipline down to a cenote and repel down a hole into the cave, Then we went snorkeling, had lunch and then went to Tulum to see the Mayan Ruins. The only complaint we had was the LONG van ride. They picked up us first, we then drove 40 minutes in the opposite direction to pick up 2 people, and then 40 minutes to pass our hotel to 2 other hotels and then onto a 25 minutes bush ride of bumps and turns to get to the cenote. Our guides were ABSOLUTELY amazing and they made the tour that much more enjoyable. We also spent a couple hours one day riding scooters around Playa del Carmen, which was great. The men body surfed the waves and played in the ocean like children, and us women tanned and occasionally went in for a swim. The only complaint I have about the trip is a sad one. We purchased a brand new digital camera worth a chunk of change and I lost it the second day at the hotel. We had just finished playing tennis and went into the sports bar. We were checking out the computers and I must have put the camera down. When we realized it was missing I went and asked at the sports bar and at the front desk and no one had turned it in. I asked day after day and no one had turned it in. We really do believe that a guest has taken it and is ignorant enough to keep it, the staff are searched at the gate when they leave their shift and our friends had left a computer and other stuff that could have been taken and it hadn't. It makes me sick to my stomach that someone didn't have the decency to turn it in. The camera is just an object, but the pictures of my children and the great pictures of the first two days are irreplacable. Whoever took the camera has no software, or hardware, or recharger for the batteries. My advice is to hold onto your posessions.

I agree with other reviews that anyone who would complain about that short walk is extremely lazy. There was a huge selection of food and we enjoyed the buffets the best. The Mediterreanean restaurant that served all seafood wasn't good at all though. A definite thumbs down. The steakhouse restaurant was really good. The rooms were very clean and adequately spacey. I've read other reviews that complained the drinks were watery, which I really disagree with. We found them to be very generous with the alcohol. ( and we drank a wide variety of drinks.) Obviously the pina coladas and daquiri's were somewhat weaker since they seem to be pre-made mixes. Our only complaint is that we wanted a couple's getaway and the Tequila did have a lot of kids running around, especially around the pool. And we didn't mind the little ones at all, but it was mostly the pre-teen boys making alot of noise and cannon-balling into the pool that annoyed us the first day we layed out. Since we had access to the Riu Yucatan and the Riu Playacar (and they were on the beach anyway),we used those two pools more. The Tequila did seem to have an amazing kids program, so anyone with kids, it would be a great place to go. All in all, we would highly recommend this hotel.

I don't want to go into huge detail but there are some things you should know (and I wish I knew before I stayed here). This is a VERY large, land bound hotel in busy Playa del Carmen. If you are looking for a quiet get-away at a beach resort this is not for you. BEACH- crowded and loud. It is about 10 minute walk which is not a huge deal but....... a little annoying. Hard to get service at beach bar because of #'s of people there! Like a Miami or LA beach! No reef/snorkling here. Just lots of people and sand. BUFFET- crowded, loud, and MONOTONOUS. Doesn't really change. Decent food but....... rather boring. Very busy, crowded seating. Actually had long lines to get food (people can be very grumpy and very rude when hot and hungry)! ROOMS- Not bad, but I am not picky. Basic motel 6+ STAFF- Great, friendly. Best thing about resort. DRINKS- Just O.K. and that might be stretching it. Watery, weak, cheap. HOTEL OVERALL- Just O.K.!! Pretty, but not overly so and compared to others farther south not even in the same league. Far enough from Playa that you had to take a cab there and back (and I jog and am not a whiner!) Listen.... everybody's tastes are different. Playa is turning into a knockoff of Cancun and this resort is a classic example. It is not a BAD hotel. But you can do soooooo much better further south where it is slower, more beautiful, and friendlier. If you want mega all-inclusive, try the likes of Bahia Principe. If You want something in the middle, try Club Maeva. If you want something small, try Tulum beach area. This resort while NICE, was too packed, crowded, and hustle bustle for me. Lots of people loved it. But ultimately it was a lot of work for me to enjoy myself. I thought I would write a line or two and it turned into alot more...... so that might tell you something. I don't think anyone would hate this hotel, but man.....why settle in this beautiful area of Mex!!!!

I travelled with my husband and 5 1/2 year old and 3 year old. There seemed to be virtually no effect of Wilma, the only thing we noticed were the tops of the palm trees a little topped off, but starting to grow back in. So I guess there may have been more shade before which didn't affect us much because the weather was so mild and comfortable that we didn't miss the shade! The rooms were not 5 starts by American standards, but certainly roomy and cleaned every day. Privacy might be an issue if travelling w/ older kids because there was only a draped opening between the room & bathroom. Not a problem for us, have a 5 1/2 & 3 yr old. Sometimes the a/c seemed not to work, but again, the weather was so mild we were fine with just the ceiling fan. It was extremely quiet!! I don't know if that was because the hotel wasn't at capacity or whether our room was set far enough back. But we never heard a thing with the balcony doors shut, even on New Years Eve! Good for families who need sleep! The pool was beautiful, but a little chilly. But our last day there it was more comfortable probably because it had gotten a bit more humid and hot outside. Lots of lounge chairs and palapas. No need to get there super early to get a spot. The miniclub, I thought we would use more. We didn't use it at all. It seemed to be just one guy who entertained/organized games with the kids. I didn't feel comfortable to leave my little ones there for more than a short time. Oh well- it was a family vacation after all! The food was OK - a little greasy for us health concious Californians! But still there were lots of fruit and other options. I ate pancakes every morning and the coffee was good! We ate at the steakhouse one night- steak was not great but good salad. We also ate at the mediteranean restaurant at the Beach Club - that was pretty bad. We left early to get desert back at the Tequila! My kids loved the ice cream with sprinkles, syrup and other fun toppings. I also agree w/ one of the previous posters. The drinks were not very good. I don't drink alcohol, but the sodas and juices were not good at all. The only exception were the fresh squeezed juices at the breakfast. But from the bar or machine -they were mostly flat and very syrupy. My husband drinks and he didn't like the wine or margaritas at all. He did find that the pina coladas were good though. And of course you can't go wrong w/ bottle beer! The wallk to the beach is so short - i'm surprised people complained about it!! The shuttle/golf cart came every few minutes so we never had a problem. The water is amazing - very calm (except the last day we were there it did get quite wavy from the wind). Not much to see if you snorkel there. I guess there are too many boats. The sand is fine, white and didn't ever burn our feet. We also went sailing one day which was fun. Also it is included in the resort all-inclusive package. We would go to the beach and eat lunch at the beach club- good lunch options, such as burgers, chicken, salad, hot dogs, pasta and very yummy guacamole! I agree with the last poster - lunch was probably the best meal! Another note about the beach - some Americans we met were surprised at topless sunbathers. It didn't bother us in the least, but some people might want to know about that beforehand. Most people did wear bathing suits, though. We also did a day trip to Xcaret - i highly recommend, especially those w/ small kids. Tons to see, in the way of sea animals, Mayan culture, beautiful aquarium and two different night time shows (one of Mexican singing and dancing; the other a re-enactment of an ancient Mayan ball game). Also a beautiful little inlet beach that you can hang out at, order food, and even snorkel. We were exhausted by the end but it was very worth it (I think about $80 per adult and our kids were free, even though our daughter was older than the age cut off but the Apple rep just said she was 4) Couple more things about the Tequila - they do have an internet cafe, pretty cheap, only $8 for one hour. There is a nightly show, which we didn't every get to see because our kids had to go to bed. Seemed fun though. The hotel also did a fabulous job decorating and making a big deal about Xmas and New Years Eve. I really thought we got a good value. The all inclusive part was very convenient when you have kids who want to snack and drink at the drop of a hat! Another tip - make sure and stock up on bottled water when you go back to the airport!! I forgot to do that and paid $4.50 (american dollars) for a bottle of Arrowhead!! It's free in your hotel room minibar! All in all we had a great experience.

The hotel was lovely, way beyond our expectations for the amount that we had paid. The grounds were well laid out with rooms grouped together in low-rise blocks of about 16 rooms which were scattered around the pool and gardens. The hotel seemed very quiet and i am not sure if this was due to the fall in tourism after Wilma or just from not all being in one large block but we found that you could always get seats at dinner, loungers round the pool etc. The rooms were quite spacious with a small balcony or terrace and a separate bathroom / dressing area. The standard rooms all have a shower as far as i understand and we had no problems whatsoever with heat / water pressure or the usual gripes posted elsewhere. I'm not sure if upgrading your rooms will get you a bath but as long as this isn't a HUGE factor in choosing your holiday i don't think that you really need to pay out the extra for an upgrade. The rooms have 2 double beds so you could probably use for a family if needs be. Mini-bar comes with the usual and optics of tequila, gin, rum and whisky. Stocked up every other day but i am sure that you could have restocked in between if you wished! The rooms were cleaned each day and there was always plenty of towels etc. We had different animals made each day out of the extra towels which i thought was a nice touch. There was a good mix of travellers (would not have said guests were predominantly English, American, Dutch etc) The staff were fantastic and were only too pleased to help out with whatever you wanted - regardless of whether or not you tipped (though it is hard to find reasons NOT to). Don't be out off by people hyping up the entertainment around the pool. The team aren't pushy and won't harrass you if you are just looking to relax. The food is amazing compared to other all inclusives i have stayed in. Breakfast became my favorite meal of the day but the buffet dinner was very good too. Always seemed to be lots of variety (too much sometimes as my waistline now reminds me!) and the dishes were replaced frequently throughout. We did try the steakhouse one night which i thought was lovely (set in the pool bar/cafe) but the buffet is so good that there isn't a need to book the a la cartes. Booking was easy and although you need to book on the day there never seemed to be a problem for those who wanted a sitting. We didn't hear of anyone picking up upset tummies while we were there. I would recommend that everyone take the short walk down to the beach (a shuttle is also available), the beach really is straight out of a brochure with white sand and turquoise water. No snorkelling to be done here really but plenty else to keep you entertained and the tequila's beach club is nice for a coffee or lunch. You are sharing the beach with the Riu Yucatan but there was planty of loungers free. We did the jungle tour (alltournative) and Tulum / Xel-Ha (??) both booked through the Thomson reps. The tours were great and exactly what we were looking for. There is some kayaking on the jungle tour so probably not for those looking for a chill-out day. If we had stayed longer we certainly would have done the Chichen Itza tour but it seemed like a long day when we were only there for a week. For those who are booking ahead for a holiday i'd definitely recommend hunting around for deals through different tour companies as i think the Thomson tours were overpriced (we found out later that the amount that reaches the tour operator is tiny compared to what you have paid over to Thomson) and you could probably do so much more for your money. Unfortunately all of the 'downsides' of the trip came from Thomsons. The check-in at Gatwick was appalling with only one desk checking about 600 people with a queue that was just horrendous even by Gatwicks standards. The flight out was delayed, having missed the departure slot from the check-in fiasco, and cramped. In spite of being in the first 3rd of people checked in i was sat 2 rows back from my husband (i think they allocate all seats before check-in so not sure of it matters how early you get to the airport!). The in-flight meals were ok really but i was surprised that there was no choice at all. We were given the wrong pick-up times by the reps for our first tour and would have missed it entirely (some people did) had we not been passing reception and seen the trucks waiting. Leaving Mexico was a bit of a nightmare but next to the Gatwick departure seemed quite well organised. Be prepared to have your suitcases opened (a lot of people were quite nasty about the Mexican security for this but really it is perfectly understandable when you realise the bad media they would get if they didn't check so thoroughly!) Again we would have been sat rows apart (even after i had been assured by reps that we had been allocated seats together) but after a bit of grumbling to the Thomson reps at the airport we were moved to seats together (right next to the loos though!!). The Thomson controlled part of this holiday was really a small blot on the holiday for such a great time at a small price Seem to have ranted on for some time but really cannot stress how great this holiday was for the money. Mexico / Riu experience was fantastic and i only wished we had booked 2 or 3 weeks instead of 1.

I am going to begin my review by saying that i had an excellent time and that the mexican people are amazing they are lovly and friendly they really make you feel safe and wanted in there country! The hotel reception areas were lovly, i went to all the other hotels (Lupita, Yucatan,playa car) and i can honestly say the tequila is much prettier! If i had to choose one to go back to it would be the tequila! Food was Ok, for how many they cater for it was excellent however i did find my self moaning to my partner most days about the food, for example at breakfast they had odd food that i can only asume was left over from thr night before, like chile pork and sweetcorn. We had hashbrowns on our first morning and they were lovly however we never saw them again, instead there were seasoned potatos? The bacon was good, the eggs were good and the coffee and juice was lovly! There was always plenty to choose from at breakfast even if it was not to everyones taste!

Evening meal was probly my least favourite as there seemed less to choose from then lunch, however i always managed to find something! As i dont drink alcohol the drinks were probly what drove me to moan the most (i dont usually moan) as the coke 7up ex all had a funny taste out of the machines and sometime were flat so tasted like syrup! I tended to drink coffee durring the day and drank banana milkshakes from the bar as they were lovly! The beach was really nice and the walk was short and the beach buggy ran every cople mins so i dont know why people moan about it! The rooms were clean and perfect, we had a different towel animal each day! There is little or no hurricane damage, tried explaning that to people at home but they still think it is damaged, i think you should understand that the mexican people work really hard, and mexico is a green house because of the heat and moisture therefore the trees and plants are back to normal except the palm trees are taking a little longer, however the really damaged ones have been replaced by new ones!!

The hotel itself is very nice and well decorated. The lobby and common areas were impressive and covered with dark wood and hand painted tiles. The grounds were well on their way to a full recovery, vegetation was growing back and palm trees sprouting new fronds. The pool was very large more then adequate as most quests seemed to use the other resorts. Day time activities were abundant and the staff tried to get you involved with something-volleyball, darts, fitness classes, etc. The rooms were okay. The beds were rather hard and pillows very thin. The guest soap and shampoo were of the poorest quality, bring your own. Other then that they were fine. Food was good and the menu was varied from American, European and Mexican selections. The buffet was better then most of the other all inclusives I've been to. The walk to the beach is about 10mins. Not a big deal for the first few times but you get tired of it after a while and this would be the reason that I would not stay here again. Sure they do have a beach tram but by the time you wait for it you might as well walk, not to mention the fact that it only transports 8 people at a time and some quests had no quams about jumping on ahead of people that had just waited for 10min. The beach is nice. A little too man made for my taste and a little crowded as two Riu resorts share the same stretch of it. No snorkling off the beach either. Went scuba diving with Scuba caribe. The dm was nice and the dives were pretty good, drift as PDC has some wicked currents. My only complaint about the op was the boat stunk, no rinse tanks and you had to step over a ledge to get on and off the boat, no easy task. But. . I saw a WHALE SHARK!!! It was amazing and I consider myself very lucky. Diving was better then I thought and am glad that I went.

Food is really good although not alot of choice with the a la carte restaurants, quality is really good. Absolutely fabulous beach which is a short walk away (not as far as other reviews have made out) and never have any problems getting loungers on the beach. All the activities are really good and there are plenty of things to choose from but you are not hassled if you dont want to join in. The entertainment in the evening is really good, the animacion team work so hard and are really nice people. All the staff are exceptionally nice people (we think that Antonio in reception should get a pay rise!) All in all, if you want a nice relaxing holiday, with fun thrown in if you feel like it, the Riu Tequila is the place to go to. Shame that 'Thomson' seem to have the monopoly on the british visitors as we really want to go back to Riu Tequila next year, but dont want to travel with Thomson. Thomson planes are outdated and one word of advice, if you are thinking of booking a thomson flight with premier seats, don't bother! we were sat directly behind the premier seats and they are not worth the \u00a3199 extra you have to pay! Also, Thomson overcharge for their excursions, Chichen itza costs $105 per person including kids 12 and over, which would have cost us $420. We booked a local MPV/minibus for 12 people which cost $220 for all of us and we could have gone anywhere we liked for the day and we were able to go really early to Chichen Itza before the crowds got there, when we were leaving (at 12.30pm) we passed the Thomson excursion bus which was just arriving! By the way, children don't pay to get into Chichen Itza under 14 so how thomson can charge adult price for 12 year olds i do not understand. We had a great time and it only costs 88pesos to get into Chichen Itza per adult.

I stayed with my mother and children, ages 3 and 18 months. It was a wonderful trip, I'd return in a heartbeat. The hotel was beautiful. The grounds were very well kept. There is no noticible damage to the huricaine, some of the palm trees were still tied at the top indicating they had just been planted and the workers were repairing some of the small palapas around the pool while we were there. I was amazed at how well the walkways were still shaded. We saw Iguanas, lots of birds, capaberra, and cats all around the property. We even saw a monkey at the Riu Yucatan one day - it ran right next to our stroller, so close the kids could have touched it. I'd say about 70% of the guests were from England with the rest being from Italy, Canada & the US. The staff was very helpful, happy and courteous. Our room was a pretty standard hotel room, but always clean and quiet. The mini-bar was restocked daily and we had no problems when we wanted extra water, pillows, and towels. The food at the resort was excellent. I never got tired of the food, there always seemed to be new choices along with the usual fair of hotdogs, hamburgers, pizza and french fries. I ate at the steakhouse one night and it was good also, although there wasn't really a need as the buffet was great. The kids club was great for the 8-12 year old age group. I thought the kids needed to be pretty independent. They could come and go as they pleased and were expected to fix thier own plates at lunch and go to the bathroom alone (which was not at the kids club). We spent some time at the kids pool, which was lots of fun and cleaned at least once a day. We also enjoyed being able to use the other Rui properties. Most mornings we walked to the Riu Lupita (on the far side of the golf course). It was a beautiful walk (a little over 2 km if you head south from the Rui Tequila around the Playacar Loop). The food over there was great and the kids club was much nicer. That resort caters to the French so we were always greeted with a Bonjour, which seemed funny, although most of the staff did speak english and spanish as well. The kids club at the Lupita has a great kids pool with 2 slides and they also have a larger playground and indoor area with crafts and bathrooms, etc. I would return to this hotel in a heartbeat. It was a wonderful trip. I was hesitant after reading some reviews here and also because it wasn't directly on the beach, but I wouldn't trade the trip for anything.

This trip replaced our disastrous holiday at the Rius in POP (Puerto PLata), Dominican Republic last year and we were so hoping that it would be much better and it was. We found everything about the resort wonderful. The staff, the grounds, our rooms, pool and the food at the restaurants was fantastic. We did find the beds hard like someone had mentioned in another review. The only complaint we heard was from someone who said they'd never go back because their kids complained about not enough food that they would eat, like McDonalds!!! We had the hamburgers and they were delicious unlike the hamburgers we have tried in Cuba and the DR. We never tried the a la cartes because we enjoyed the selection of foods at the buffets and we can't be bothered to get up early to book although it wasn't crowded so we could have easily booked when we were eating breakfast. Because of the health issues last year at POP we (my husband and I) took bismuth tablets at every meal. I assumed my kids were too but at the end of the week I asked if they had been using them and much to my surprise they said no and none of us were ill. The only noticeable damage at the Rius from the hurricanes was the tree tops and they were growing their leaves back. When you walked down the street or on the beach you could see damage done to the other resorts. Other than the Viva Wyndham salesmen bugging you to go in there were no problems. It wasn't crowded the week we were there so there was no worries about finding a decent place at the beach or pool or long lines for food. We didn't have to book a seating time for supper which was great, we just went when we wanted to. Probably when it gets busier they'll go back to seated times. The beach didn't have much shade, people were using chairs to make shade and the water was fairly rough with a constant undertow which you could feel even just walking in the water. We walked on the beach daily and even though we love the beach we spent most of our time at the pool because of the rough water. The 8-10 minute walkway to the beach was great for exercise and was well shaded. If anyone is wondering if they should go or not, definitely go. From our experience we'd go back tomorrow.

We were there 3 days longer due to Hurricane Wilma. Yes, the hotel did it's best to deliver food to us while the hurricane was in full blast. We did feel safe considering the circumstances. However the hotel charged for the 3 additional days. We talked to other guests (British, European, Apple Vacations), and they were not charged for the extra time they stayed. For some, it was almost a whole week. I asked the front desk what happened if we didn't have the money. He responded that it hasn't happened and that they had sent Federales to the airport in past instances...???? We would have enjoyed our stay had the hurricane stayed away. However, after it was all over, it was very apparent the front desk staff were getting irritable and not so friendly. Sometimes they were downright rude. It was very frustrating because we were trying to figure out how we would get home. Our tour rep from Suntrips was HORRIBLE! She was a pathological liar. She claimed to be there when she wasn't, and she didn't show up after SHE set a \"9:00 a.m. sharp\" meeting. Another guy showed up 40 minutes late to tell us Anne-Christine wasn't coming and he had no new information. Thanks for nothing Suntrips! Suntrips informed us that it was up to Riu hotels to refund us for the portion of the hotel we didn't get to use. I'm sure we will go around and around and get nothing. It's all so frustrating. I'm questioning whether I will stay at another Riu hotel depending on the outcome of this. I realize a hurricane is not their fault, but it's not mine either and why should I be completely out of the hard-earned money I paid to enjoy a vacation?? There were a lot of rude Europeans (not UK people) who were very selfish in the foods lines. Do they not know how a line works?

Rooms- Clean and comfortable, consists of two double beds, has a spacious bathroom/changing area seperated from the bedroom via a curtain. Has a mini-bar containing pepsi,7up,orange,mineral water and corona beers, also has a liquor dispenser with vodka,rum,tequila and gin (restocked every 2nd day and at your request if you call reception) Pool- There was two pools, the side with the pool bar was usually the busiest, the other side was more chilled out this is where the activities such as water polo took place. There is plenty of shade by the pool, although sunloungers where taken up quite quickly. Beach- You will not be dissapointed by the beach crystal clear blue waters,swaying palm trees, as it looks on the postcards, plenty of sunloungers avalible, We tended to head to the beach later in the day about 4pm as there wasn't alot of shade. The two minute walk down a shaded path wasn't an issue and if you want you can even take a golf cart there which is nicknamed by the hotel staff as the wolley trolley!

We just returned from a 5-day stay and we can\u2019t wait to go back!! At the outset let me say that All-Inclusive is the only way to go!! Let me also mention here to PLEASE TIP THE STAFF!!!! Even though you are going all-inclusive, the staff does such a fabulous job that you will want to tip them!! From the moment we arrived until we left we were treated with the utmost hospitality by all the staff. First let me describe our room. Our official check-in time was 3pm, but they had it ready by 2:30!! Kudos to the incredibly hard working staff! When we walked in a towel elephant greeted us on our bed and the cleanest room I have EVER stayed in!!! The room had a patio and a very spacious closet with a safe in it. Very important to keep your travel docs and cash etc. in here. Next the food. How this hotel can feed 800 people per meal and still manage to have the diversity and high quality we experienced in our food is amazing!!! We did not eat at any of the other hotels, but if you go all-inclusive you do have reciprocal privileges. At the Tequila there are 2 buffet restaurants. The more formal of the two does require reservations at the beginning of your stay and proper dress attire i.e. no swimming trunks. (Either 7pm or 9pm)We ate there every night during our stay and found the food to be quite delicious. Additionally, the staff does the most amazing ice sculptures and fruit sculptures (different ones nightly) that are truly works of art for the evening meal. The Tequila also has 4 bars and yes, ONE IS A SWIM UP!!! Is there a better way to vacation than drinking in a pool?? The drink selections are good \u2013 for the vodka lovers I would recommend the Blue Ocean. Even though I am not a tequila drinker I must say that both my husband and I agree that we had the best margaritas here too. NO, you\u2019re not going to be served Hangar One (My personal Vodka fav), but remember that you are at an All-Inclusive resort!! There are a few concessions you need to make!!! There is absolutely no way that the bars can stock everybody\u2019s favorite top shelf booze!! We did the Tulum /Xel-Ha All- Inclusive day trip and it was AMAZING!!! That\u2019s all I can say because no words can possibly do it justice! Imagine swimming in an aquarium of turquoise water that is crystal clear and full of brightly colored fish all around you. Now that won\u2019t even come close to the magic of actually snorkeling at Xel-Ha with the sunshine falling on your shoulders while you view this amazing wonder. The wildlife here is also great. We sat at one of the many bars in the park and fed scraps of lettuce to the iguanas walking through the bar. Definitely an experience that you wouldn\u2019t have in the Midwest!! As an aside, you MUST have biodegradable sunscreen to use here. They do sell it inside the park ($16 for a 4 oz tube). Tulum was very educational as an important archeological site in the Mayan history. Some tips \u2013 DO pay the $2 for the \u201ctrolley\u201d ride from the gate to the city entrance. DO take a bottle of water and camera with you. DO wear good walking shoes. DO buy the Mayan cartouche pendant if you want a really cool souvenir. DO NOT walk from the gate to the city entrance \u2013 the road is narrow and bordered by FILTHY water on both sides. DO NOT use the bathroom at the gate \u2013 wait until you get to the city entrance. (Unless you don\u2019t mind paying for a toilet) Again, PLEASE TIP YOUR TOUR GUIDES!!!!

For the little children, strawberry slush puppies were just the thing. The Entertainment...was'nt fantastic, very un-professional, and the entertainers did'nt sing, they just mimed to music...but like us, if you like the music it was fine to listen to! They did try though! Watch out for the flying baby bats! They are very scary! Well if you are squeemish! Parasailing on the beach was amazing...you get a jet ski ride to the boat too. Xel-Ha...was a totally amazing experience, but one day is totally not long enough. We only did three activites, there are many more. Swimming with the dolphins was amazing too, but very expensive for just a few minutes. Photographs and DVD are a MUST HAVE but $20 for photos, and $50 for a DVD. On the whole, holiday was great, but very busy, and you don't really get to see the same people twice...feels rather impersonal. But if you like loads of people, having a laugh, and being able to eat laods then this is your type of holiday!

( Pick a number from the menu - oh dear !!!!!!!! Boom Boom ) Well i won't bore with full details on each thing but a general idea of it all, HOTEL- Superb great foyer and very relaxing, rooms spread about in blocks throughout in very nice coconut gardens, thus being differrent than being in a one big hotel multiple floors, STAFF- All very helpful and always polite, ROOMS- Nice and clean, Firm large beds,Air conditioning, you have a balcony, mini fridge, with stocked soft drinks, beer, water ect, Also a optics cabinet in your room, towels supplied, and clean daily with towel left on your bed in animal designs daily ( we tipped the maids daily ) POOLS- Nice pools and a swim up bar on the one side ( only used it a bit ha!!! and managed to stop on the stool this year LOL!! private joke!!! ) The pools at the YUCATAN by the beach are very nice and add to a great day down the beach, FOOD- Well it was a great choice every day and night, people who complain about this and it's not many ( where/what ? do you normally eat ?? because overall superb and Top marks, hot and cold food both alike great choice, Steak House we tried and really liked it, nice to be waitered on and menu was nice, ( you have to book this in the mornings at the hotel ) on the main evening meals you have a set time slot EARLY OR LATE times with ample time on each to not rush, also note on the evening meals you have a set table for your holiday duration, unlike BREAKFAST you sit anywhere in the dining hall. ANIMATION and ENTERTAINMENT- Overall was very good, and the team works very hard, but i suppose as i was there less than a year ago, we sort of knew alot of the shows, but nonetheless very enjoyable and some interaction with the audience, some better than others, highlights Michael Jackson show VERY GOOD, BAR STAFF- Very hard working and quick service for alot of people at the bar, the staff all get the orders and the drinks more or less come from 2/3 people, Nice staff Cruz,Patricia, Alfonso,Arsenio, and more, BEACH- Very nice and cocunut lined trees, the water is lovely and clear, feed the fish in the morning even 2 metres off the beach we had a couple 2 feet long taking the bread and lots of Angel fish, you can have snorkel masks ect for FREE one hour a day, and none motorised sports available as well, Pedallos ect, you pay for PARASAILING activities, NOTE- As we were last year we did notice the beach has a slope into the water nothing drastic but we think this may have been caused from the hurricane last year and moved the sand somewhat, but nothing bad, there is a nice walk to the beach from the TEQUILA through a nice walkway 10 mins and a nice relaxing wlak, lookout for the Iguanas, Squirrels, and Aqouti a funny little animal with no tail also seen around the hotel, on the beach we even saw a Humming bird in the flowers getting nectar, there is also transport running from the hotel down to the beach if you don't like walking, some people complain about the walk, so you have an option, you can also eat down at the YUCATAN and drink so no need to go back up to your hotel, TRIPS- If you fancy going to CANCUN for the day about 35 miles ask for a taxi and arrange a price $90 US this is say for all 4 in a taxi there and back, and you tell them where you want to go shopping malls ect and they take and wait for you at each place and you make the times back ect, this is better than taking the coach trip up as they take you to a set places and i heard not as good after i told various people of the Taxi deal, we tipped him on return to hotel we left at 0900 and got back at 1630, and whilst your up there you can eat and drink at the RIU CANCUN as it's a riu and it has a nice front looking onto the beach ( SEE PHOTO'S ). COZUMEL - Take the ferry ( BLUE or WHITE ferry's ) from Playa del carmen $10 each way takes about 30 minutes, well worth it, nice over there be prepared to haggle and also everyone wants you to come into their shop, part of the fun thou, There are many other organised trips and you would have to decide which is for you, DIVING, FISHING, SNORKELLING, SIGHTSEEING, Ect, OTHER AMMENTITIES- Internet room, shop, and a short walk to local shopping area, Well hope this gives you a flavour of it, we really like the TEQUILA and we will return yet again, althou not next year, give it a try you won't be dissappointed, we did notice more English there this year, in the main it was Spanish, Belgium, Germans, American's, Canadian's, Scottish, Dutch, we also met a few nice people from the North Geordieland & Les from Liverpool hi-ya!! , Go and enjoy it great experience, Thanx again to the Riu Tequila and the friendly people in Mexico.", "Date": "October 12, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Columbia, MO", "Title": "\u201cWhat a Blast\u201d", "Author": "jujujen", "ReviewID": "UR3998565", "Content": "Had to postpone our trip to the Riu Tequila due to Emily but just returned from a week at the there on September 17, 2005. It was great. The weather was perfect. The hotel grounds were beautiful. Staff was great. The Animacion players - where do they get their energy? They organized games and tournaments througout the day, gave awards at the main stage at night, played more games, danced with guests and always looked fresh and energized. They really seem to love what they do. The evening shows were great. What I liked the best was how family friendly this resort is. We spent a lot of time around the swim up bar with the kids. The bartenders never let your glass stay empty and they too had fun. The food was great too. So much variety. We ate 4 of the nights at the steak house - need reservations, never had trouble getting one. One night our child was not well so we had to take him back to the room, they fixed us plates to take with us. There is also a mediterranean restaurant by reservation for dinner - we did not make it there. There was always a variety of food available - ALL DAY LONG!!! For breakfast, you never had to eat the same thing twice. Made to order omelettes, pancakes, french toast, fresh donuts, fresh fruit, smoothies, cereals, cheese and meat trays, are just some of the items available. It was tough to choose and also hard to decide what to do each day. We didnt make it to the beach everyday because we were having so much fun at the hotel we did not want to miss anything. The beach is a brief 5 - 7 minute (easy) stroll from the front lobby. It is a shadded walk so it was pleasant. They have a shuttle which was easy to catch, but with all the eating we did, we felt we should walk! At the end of the path is the restaurant at the Riu Yucatan, where you can help yourself to food and drink. The pool there is also available. All the water sports are here as well, snorkling, kayaking, wind surfing. All of these are indluded. The taxi ride into Playa was US$5.00. Worth it. We walked back from town once, took about 45 minutes and it was very hot, wished we would have taken the taxi. Something for americans to be aware of, is the topless women by the pool. We knew we would see this and prepared our son (age 11), but expected it to be at the beach, so we were surprised to see so many by the hotel pool. After the first day, it was not a big deal anymore though. The only complaint is the beds are extremely firm, more like very hard. But at the end of a full day, who cares?!

We were there with our good friends and the 4 of us really enjoyed it. After spending months reading reviews on hotels in Mexico on TA and finally booking a hotel, hurrican Emilly destroyed the first hotel so we had to find an alternative. We were all very pleased with the reviews of this hotel and we wanted to give our honest opinion having stayed there. OVERALL This is an excellent hotel, the staff are a delight and all greet you with a smile and an \"hola\" everywhere you go. THE POOLS The 2 pools are huge and although they tended to have bits of the straw from the roofs or a few little bugs or leaves in them (unavoidable) the pool man was there to take them out throughout the day. Having read a few of the previous comments I agree, there are indeed a lot of topless women! THE ROOMS The rooms were very nice, very well cleaned and the maid service was fab. Each day we came back to our room to find a new animal made out of towels and blankets! It was fun to come back to the room after a day at the beach/ pool to see what creation she had made. The fridges were well stocked with Corona, carbonated water, Pepsi and Sprite etc which was a Godsend as the all inclusive juice from the bars was really terrible. Very syrupy and not nice, one day the juice in the restaurant tasted of chlorine - be warned! The optics housed vodka, gin, tequila and rum. I heard on the plane home that some guests asked for brand named vodka in their optics and it was replaced with the likes of Smirnoff. I left a note to ask for purely Corona and Pepsi and shortly afterwards the fridge was restocked as per our request - the staff really could not do more for you. We asked for our 2 rooms to be next door and what we actually got was great - our own door which then led to 2 rooms so we were able to keep main door closed and have our 2 doors open when we wanted to. If you fancy this ask for rooms 1310 and 1309. ANIMALS The animals around the resort are wonderful from iguanas, gheckos and cats to the weirdest looking creatures we have seen - all very cute! ENTERTAINMENT As for the animation team they are all stars. Each night (I don't know where they got the energy from!) they put on a first class show - they are obviously all professioal dancers and not your usual 18 year old club rep. The shows were worth watching. From Michael Jackson to husband and wife night to Musicals etc. Throughout the day the animators organised rifle shooting, dancing, casino games, bingo, water polo, volleyball etc. THE BEACH The beach is lovely, just like the brochures. Seemed easy to get hold of loungers. You can get juice and food from the other 2 Riu hotels on the beach so no need to go back to the Tequila. It was nice to have a choice of hotels to use the different pools and facilities etc. THE FOOD The food was very nice and much higher quality than we expected. The food hall was massive and there were lots of chiefs on hand every meal time to cook you a fresh portion of pasta or omlettes or doughnuts, whatever. Every night there was fish, meat, chicken, salads, veg, cakes, fruit etc. Apparently at the Riu Cancun there is a Japanese, Brasilian and Mexican restaurant so this would have been great at the Tequila as there would have been more choice of places to eat. The Steakhouse at the Tequila was very nice though. PLAYA DEL CARMEN We tired of the food after about 10 days so ventured into Playa del Carmen. This is a quaint little place with a few decent shops for jewellery, bikinis, sunglasses etc then lots of the usual touristy places. Senor Frogs is worth a visit for a Yard cocktail! We can recommend a lovely restaurant there called La Casa Del Agua which I think was on 5th Avenue (ask at reception, it was them that recommended it to us) It was the type of high quality restaurant we go to back home and did not expect to come across there! Sea bass was excellent as were the prawns and steaks. There is also a Johnny Rockets, Subway and McDonalds. TRIPS With regard to trips we went on Thomsons Cancun shopper. I would not advise this as they really just took us to 3 malls they wanted us to go to - not the ones we would have gone to if we had gone alone. The Thomson trip to Chitchen Itza was very worthwhile - I have to admit being pregnant I was not looking forward to the 3.5 hour trip there then 3.5 hours back but it was a deluxe coach with sodas and waters etc all the way there and back. The tour guide was extremely knowledgeable with excellent English - the jokes were hillarious! The Mayan ruins were worth the visit. Then they took us to a Mayan restaurant for lunch. We also went to Xcaret. This was a fun day out. The show at night was a long 2 hours but we left early to get a taxi without waiting. We also got the boat to Cozumel. We were not impressed by it but that may just have been us, however as our friends went snorkelling and thoroughly enjoyed it. The boat took about 30 mins. So, the high points; the people, the cleanliness, the quality of the food, the entertainment The low points; the soft drinks from the bars This really is a nice hotel and we had an excellent time there.

We booked our holiday with Portland and paid only a little more than we usually have for holidays to Greece and Spain, and we have never had an all inclusive holiday before, always done self catering \u2013 never again, after this experience we will always go all inclusive at RIU if possible!! We were checked in on the coach from the airport which we thought a good idea, no waiting at reception just tell them your room number you have been allocated then collect room keys, safe key and towel cards The rooms are lovely, huge beds and very clean. The walk to the beach is lovely, and the buggy is good fun if you can't be bothered to walk! The food, bars, buildings and pools at the hotel are all lovely but what made our holiday was the staff, they all really never stop, even the manageress was on duty from 8am (when we had breakfast) till around 11pm. Each morning, we'd make a beeline for the juice bar and then had the tough decision of whether it would be fresh Banana, Melon, and Pineapple, Grapefruit or Orange juice that we would start the morning off with, Then onto Doughnuts, pancakes. EGGS - fried - scrambled \u2013 poached \u2013 boiled, even on toast then onto mushrooms tomatoes beans a toasting machine and different types of bread and lots of other goodies sometimes steak? They seem to cater for any nationality. The week was FULL of tough choices like that!! As others have mentioned, for dinner we \"had\" to be at the Tequila, but this was a pleasure as the food was again superb!! Any other meal can be taken at either the Yucatan or the Playacar. You do get an assigned seat on your first night using the buffet, but this is flexible. One of the real benefits of the assigned seating is that you get to know your waiter. Our waiter got to know us and what we liked, he had our glasses refilled almost before we could ask. We weren\u2019t expecting this kind of service at a buffet, so we were very impressed! We also made reservations for 1 night at the poolside Steakhouse Choice of steak chicken or some sort of kebab, we chose steak. The meal we had was very nice, the wine took a while to get used to, they have red, ros\u00e9 and white, but it does clear out the palette. But perhaps the only downside to the a-lacarte restaurant is that you miss the massive choice of the buffet restaurant. BEACH: How do you describe heaven? Glorious wide white sand beaches, swaying palm trees, cooling ocean breezes, and the sparkling many-colored waters of the Caribbean!! You can't touch this!!! The swimming is safe and very enjoyable. The Caribbean is relatively warm for ocean water, and letting the soft breakers bob you up and down is so relaxing. POOLS: We found pools to be really nice and were always being cleaned by the staff the pool bar was our favorite and the bar staff never stopped if they were not serving they were cleaning the bar down they even steam cleaned all the bar area every morning before opening. ROOMS: We found the rooms clean, cool and very well maintained. The air-conditioning kept the rooms from getting warm, and the ceiling fan was a godsend after a hot day in the sun! The musty smell mentioned in other reports is evident but you get use to it, after all you don\u2019t spend your holiday your room, a smelly is a good idea, but we didn\u2019t bother We always find that being polite and saying HOLA and a few words in Spanish goes a long way. One thing that really impressed us was how clean everywhere was. The staff seem to be cleaning all day. The only let-down would be the Corona beer during the day this was served in plastic tumblers, and I appreciate that around pools its safer but was a bit flat, but in glasses at dinner it was ok, but what the heck, during the day have cocktails instead. OVERALL: This is definitely a 5-Star resort experience!! The Riu staff and management seem to go out of their way to make the experience a treat and seem genuinely interested in seeing you come again.

It can be difficult to get a shaded spot if you come any later than 9am though. The swim up bar was excellent, if a bit crowded midday, but the whole pool area was never too crowded to ruin your enjoyment. We did some brilliant excursions: Tulum and Xel-Ha (snorkelling in Xel-Ha) Xcaret (snorkelled in an underground river) Chichen Itza (climbed the pyramid) Dolphin Discovery at Puerto Aventuras. These were all done through the travel rep and were expensive but worth it - also we are not the sort of people to just sunbathe for two weeks so we were happy enough to pay the prices. We also did a trip through Scuba Caribe, based in the hotel lobby where we took a boat with a group of other people and went snorkelling off a coral reef. The currents were quite strong though. The choice of food changes daily so you are never bored and you have a plateful before you have even seen half of what's on offer! There are also a good choice of cocktails available all day long. There is a different show every night - eg Michael Jackson, Grease, Mexican night, Moulin Rouge, the only draw back was that as we were on the later dinner seating (9pm-10.30pm) we had difficulty in finding a seat at the show.

Beautiful resort!! The grounds, the pool, the restaurant, everything looked liked it was going to be a beautiful stay. Checked into the room then went to walk around the resort for a while. Had lunch at the place by the pool then took a walk down to the beach at the Yucatan. Just beautiful. Must say we think the Riu Tequila is a lot nicer than the Yucatan or the PLayacar. Couldn't tell much about the Palace though. The only problem is the Tequila is much HOTTER!!! You can really tell the difference when you are even 800 yards off the coast. Would stay there again if it wasn't summer. We walked back to the Tequila after a couple hours at the beach and Yucatan pool. Got ready for dinner. Good buffet but pretty hot in the dining area. Hard to enjoy a nice meal when sweating. Even the white wine was warm.yuck! Went to watch the show. Okay, kinda cheesy. Went back to to the room. Didn't sleep the night before so decided to crash. Day 2 Headed down to the lobby to book our Captain Hook's dinner cruise for Friday. Was told hurricane Emily was coming Monday!! Decided to head into Playa Del Carmen for some shopping. Went to Senor Frog's for some Margs then walked up n down 5th ave. I was looking forward to the Blue Parrot but thought it looked nasty. Dirty place, gross bathrooms, bee's everywhere so just kept walking. Went to the Big Lobster restaurant for a late lunch for my stepdaughters B-Day. Had a blast. Great food and the service was great. Had jalapeno shrimp poppers, mussels, tableside ceasar salad, fajitas, tableside bananas foster. decided to head back to the Tequila. Again really hot there. Had some dinner then went to the Tequila disco. Pretty cool. Kinda small, decent music but at least had air conditioning!! Called it a night. Day 3 Just a day to hang out by the pool. Had a good time. Just relaxed and drank at the swim up bar. Bartenders there were pretty good. Especially if you tip. Actually I don't think I saw anyone tip the whole time except for us. Even when we tipped it didn't seem to make a difference. Even heard the bartenders mumbling \"all inclusive, all inclusive\". I threw them a $10 spot once and they about freaked.lol. Anyway decided to head back to the room and get ready for the Captain Hook's dinner cruise. That wound up being the best part of the vacation. What a blast, a must do with great lobster. The stak was so so but great lobster. Passed out on the way home.haha. Went right to the room after that Day 4 After breakfast we decided to head to Playa Del Carmen to meet up with some boys my daughter new from Colorado and hang out at Senor Frogs. Come to find out they shut everything down. Mexico law says no alcohol can be served till after the hurricane. We had sushi at this little place and watched as they boarded everything up. Very dissapointed. Went back to the resort cause we could still drink there. Pretty much a wasted day. Nothing much to do. Day 5 Got up and headed to the pool. Found out our resort wasn't serving alcohol after 1pm. Drank like a fish at the pool till then.haha. Went to the lobby to get all the hurricane instructions. The hotel stocked our mini bar with sandwiches, milk and water. It started raining about 6 or 7 ish. So we started playing hurricane volleyball with the neighbors in the rain!! About 9ish the rain was picking up. I met a guy from Oklahoma and he asked if I wanted to run to the beach and check it out. Crazy me said yes. Pretty nasty down there. Took some pics of me holding on to a tree. Ran back to our resort fast. Drank a lot of Margaritas from our mini bar and hung out on the steps with the neighbors till about 11:50pm. 15 minutes later the Hurricane kicked in. 2 hours of solid wind, rain, lightning, our door banging, the curtains blowing trees flying and breaking. The power went out and the room was so hot we were dripping with sweat. Talk about a long night. Day 6 Walked outside and couldn't believe our eyes. Total destruction. Not to the buildings with the rooms, but everything else. Trees were broke or riiped out of the ground. Trees in balconies. Little huts by the pool destroyed. Walked down to the beach through the Riu Playacar. Just nasty. Everything broken with trees laying in the streets. Wished we were at home. A lot of helped out on the resort cleaning up. Most everyone just hung out for the day at the lobby or entertainment area. Power was back in the morning as was phone service. Not much to say about today. Day 7 A full day at the beach!! Well almost for me. I booked a parasailing tour for the 4 of us on Friday for Sunday thru Scuba Caribe. I spent 2 hours trying to get my money back because they said there was going to be no parasailing till Wednesday because of winds. I was so mad. My last day at the beach and they were giving me the runaround. I finally snapped and told the lady she was ruining my only full day at the beach with my family. I went to the Resort manager who came with me. He yelled at them and within 30 minutes we had our money. This just in.....Scuba Caribe Company sucks!!!! Sorry had to vent. Finally went back to the beach and did enjoy the rest of the day and actually got a great tan!!! Day 8 Coming home. Couldn't believe how fast they cleaned up the resort. Wish we coulda stayed at least one more day to do a tour or something. Oh well. Don't know if I am going back to the Roo anytime soon after this. So is Akumal a lot nicer then PDC you think? Seemed PDC is just kinda dirty anymore. Almost liked Cancun for the Captain Hooks tour better. Talk me into Alkumal guys please!! Otherwise I think I am done with the roo for awhile.

I, my wife, sister and brother in law, have nothing but admiration for EVERYONE who works there. Waiters, Maids, Cooks, Gardeners and even the hotel manager who with the help of the majority of geusts, rolled up their sleeves and helped with the clear up opperation. It was quite moveing to see all nationalaties and age groups pulling together. All staff showed how professional and efficient they could be in crisis. Structuraly the hotel was spared any serious damage but the pool area and surrounding grounds were badly hit. Both pools had to be drained, scrubbed and refilled. Local labour was soon draughted in and within a few days clear up was almost completed. For new arrivals it was almost back to normal, if however looking a bit sparse. When we left the second pool was still to be filled(not the one with the swim up bar, yipee)but it wouldn't be long before that be flly opperational. Anyway don't want to bang on about that. Check in on the bus, brilliant idea!! so simple. On entering the grand reception you know your'e in for a treat. All staff so very friendly, allways smileing and nothings to much trouble.

Our vacation was booked through Apple vacations. This was our first time to the area and we had a very good time. Upon arrival to the Tequila it looked great, the lobby was impressive and the grounds well manicured. After getting up at 3am to catch our 6am flight by 12:30 when we arrived we were ready to get out of our clothes, eat , and maybe sit by the pool. Unfortunately this did not happen for about 3 hours. The front desk claimed no rooms were ready that's fine after all check in was at 3. We assumed they could hold our luggage, but no they told us to \"just leave it in the lobby\". Now being from NY I'm not to keen on leaving my luggage anywhere especially when people were just grabbing luggage and walking out. We did however grab something to eat and then went back to the lobby to sit and wait (I brought my carry-on with me as it had valuables in it). If they were able to hold our luggage someplace besides the middle of the lobby I would not even be mentioning this but we were just not comfortable with this. After being told 3 times to come back at a later time, because the rooms are still not ready we were finally able to check in. The only other problems we incurred was the air conditioner in our room did not work well at all, we did call to complain and they sent someone whatever he did it only helped slightly. The toilet clogged twice but maintenance came right away to fix it. Also I called twice for an extra blanket to put on the mattress and that never came. And on our last day we needed a wake up call at 5:30am to catch our plane , and we never got that or a bellboy after we had called for one to help with the luggage and it was getting late so we had to drag our own luggage. Not that big of a deal but when your in the last building second floor and its 6am it would have been nice. THE ROOM: The room was in the last building on the resort not terribly far from everything but not convenient to run back to the room or run to the lobby for something. Otherwise the room was clean and well maintained, we did tip the maid everyday. Beds were hard but it didn't bother us too much, we just couldn't sleep on our sides or it would hurt our hips. Fridge was stocked every other day with waters, soda, and coronas. We left a couple of dollars in the fridge, and we always received extra water bottles because thats what we drank the most of. We found it to be spacious enough for the two of us and there was no bad smell as mentioned in some of the other reviews. We did have a second floor room so Im not sure if that had something to do with it not smelling damp. The bathroom was separated by a curtain, but the toilet was in its own room with a separate door. There was a safe located in the closet which they gave you the for at check in. THE FOOD: The buffet is located in the lobby area, breakfast and lunch are served here. On your first night you pick a seating time and are assigned a table. You will eat at this time at the same table for your whole stay. For summer its 7-8:30 or 9-10:30 (both are 1/2 hour earlier in the winter). At the advice of the maitrd we choose the later. He said the first one is always crazy and has a lot of kids. For breakfast you may sit anywhere you like and go anytime between 7am -10:30am. Food was plentiful and good, there was always a wide variety from what I saw. Lunch is served in the restaurant in-between the pools, this also turned into the steakhouse at night. They served food in there from 12-6 which I thought was nice since we didn't eat untill 9 we usually grabbed a snack late in the afternoon. We did eat at the steakhouse one night and we both thought it was very good. Reservations are made in the lobby in the morning for the restaurants. We had no problem getting one when we got to the lobby at about 8:30am. The seafood restaurant is located down by the beach we never made it there. Menus for both stayed the same each night with about 5-6 entree choices. Unfortunately both my boyfriend, and I did get stomach problems so after day 3 we couldn't eat that much. We were careful of what we ate and didn't even use the tap water to brush our teeth. That's just a chance you take when going to Mexico, it could happen staying anywhere. Luckily it wasn't bad enough to keep us in the room and I was stocked with Imodium, tums, and pepto. POOLS & BEACH: We loved the pools and never had a problem finding a sun lounger no matter what time we got there. Staff was always cleaning out the pool, and if it was in need of a paint job as I read in other reviews I never noticed it. One side of the pool had the swim up bar, this seemed to be the \"active\" side. For a more relaxed atmosphere just sit on the other side (restaurant separates the two sides). There was a pool party one day with ice sculpture carving, fruit carving, and towel animal making. Staff was always trying to get people involved. The beach was gorgeous. The bluest water I have ever seen. Beach is across the street, there is a nice shaded walkway to walk down or a little golf cart that held about 7 people that runs back and forth. The walk is really not too bad, but it did get too be a little much for us since we were in the last building on the resort. It wasn't really an issue though we just took the little golf cart when we went to the beach. EXTRAS: There was nightly entertainment mostly cheesy but fun. The board in the lobby will tell you all the activities going on that day , and what the show will be that night. There is also a disco. There was a little shopping center down the block that we visited it was very convenient. We bought an extra underwater camera there and some souvenirs both reasonably priced. We also visited the town ($5 taxi ride) a couple of times, we even walked there one day when it rained. The walk took about 25 minutes, it wasn't that bad but even in the rain it was extremley hot and we opted for the taxi back. They have tons of bars, restaurants, and shops. The Riu Yucatan had been closed for moths, and opened back up during our stay. It was nice to use their pool as it is right on the beach. You can use all their facilities, but you do need to eat dinner at the Tequila. Same applies for the Riu Playacar. EXURSIONS: We went to Xel-ha booked on our own through the internet before we left. We really enjoyed it, we did the dolphin swim which was worth every penny we loved it. Xel-ha is about 30 mins away from the tequila , we took a taxi there($38). We took the ADO (public bus)back had we have known the ADO was so nice we would have taken it there too. It's a big air-conditioned bus with TV's. It drops you off at the station in town and only cost $8 for both of us. Then we took a taxi back to the hotel for $5. The other tour we took was booked through Apple.They had a representative located in the lobby to book tours or answer any questions. Other vacation reps were there too, you had to book tours through whoever you booked your vacation with. The tour was a snorkeling tour that took us to 3 snorkeling sights one of them being a cave which was very cool. We also did a cliff jump. We enjoyed this tour as well. All and all we had a great time. We only ran into a few problems, and we wished we could have enjoyed the food more but overall this is a very nice hotel. Don't forget your bug spray the mosquitous are brutal especially after the rain. Tip the staff we did everyone bartenders, waiters, maids , maintenance. They are so pleasant and work hard for little $$. We probably wouldn't stay here again, because we like to go different places on each vacation, but for the price we paid we felt we got our moneys worth.", "Date": "July 22, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manchester, England", "Title": "\u201cAn honest opinion from a British Holiday Maker\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3684762", "Content": "My boyfriend and I have just returned from a 2-week holiday at the Riu Tequila,Playacar, Mexico. Overall we had a great holiday but I want t write an honest review from a British Holiday Maker as the reviews we read didn't fit the hotel we stayed at. Here are some points to consider: \u2022 The best thing about the hotel was the staff. They worked so hard for you and always had a smile on their face. \u2022 We didn't stay around the pool in the daytimes as we felt it was a little too small for the size of the hotel making it very noisy. The swim-up bar sounded great but when we went to have a look it was over crowded and everyone was pretty drunk. This obviously depends on what you want out of a holiday but we felt a lot of people staying at the Riu wanted to drink all day everyday. \u2022 Instead of the pool we went to the beach which was gorgeous with a lovely beach restaurant where you can help yourself. Unfortunately there was building work going on at the Riu Yucatan which was behind us and quite noisy. \u2022 The food in the hotel was lovely (especially the buffet restaurant). The beach restaurant is in a lovely setting but only does sea food which my boyfriend is allergic to so we couldn't go there. There were 3 other restaurants. The buffet restaurant had the best selection of food but was very big and noisy and lacking in atmosphere. When we go on holiday the evening meal is a big part. \u2022 The trips were all great but expensive. We paid \u00a380 to go swimming with dolphins and \u00a350 for Chitchen Itza but would recommend both. There is a bus station in Playa del Carmen where you can book trips cheaper. \u2022 Rooms were a good size with a large shower / changing area but felt they needed a little updating. \u2022 The coctails seemed watered down (as in lots of all inclusive hotels) I don't think I would go all inclusive again as, although it was good value, we did feel a bit restricted.

I read quite a lot of reviews prior to going and they were quite mixed but all I can share is our experience. The holiday from the moment we checked in to the moment we checked out was out of this world. First of all we checked in on the coach leaving the airport on the way to the hotel to save time queuing at reception, this was a great idea. When we arrived at the hotel we were personally show to our rooms and our luggage was taken there. The rooms theirself were very clean and well maintained and the airconditioning proved to be invaluable. The beds weren't the comfiest I have ever slept on but who goes on holiday to stay in bed? The pools were well maintained and a good size, despite what I had read on reviews we never had a problem finding a sunlounger. The food was fabulous, we had something different every evening and we were warned that the Steakhouse wasnt very good but we found that there was enough food and it was delicious. What made our holiday I feel were the hardworking hotel staff. Nothing was too much trouble and they always greeted you, even the maids who did a fantastic job. Whilst we were there we didnt see much sun and it rained 10 days out of 14 but we still made the most of it. The beach was absolutely out of this world, it was paradise. Whilst we were there we heard people complaining about having to get a mini train there but to be honest it was only a 5 minute walk away. The entertainment at night was average but it was put on by the Animacion Team after they had spent all day trying to coax people into the various activities on offer. We took a trip into Playa Del Carmen and there are plenty of shops and bars, its good if you need a change of scenery. We also went on the Catamaran trip, this was well worth $55 dollars each. You were in the boat approx 3 hrs and got to snorkel and there was drink and fresh fruit flowing, that was truly paradise. We also went on the speedboats through the jungle, this was good but i thought it was a bit pricey.

So fabulous, in fact that 4 of us are returning for exactly the same 2 weeks to celebrate our first wedding anniversary this year. From the moment we entered the hotel lobby we were given 5 star treatment. The porters relieved us of our bags immediately and we were given a refreshing glass of fruit punch while we checked in. Everyone was suitably impressed with the rooms and the air con was extremely welcoming. We wasted no time in sampling our mini bar while we waited for our cases to arrive. As there were so many of us we had a block to ourselves and I`m sure our screams of excitement could be heard all around the complex. The food was wonderful....especially breakfast!!!!! There were so many choices, they had catered for ALL tastes. The freshly squeezed fruit juices every morning were impressive....and the opportunity to try cactus juice was one not to be missed!!!!! Fitting into my wedding dress was the only thing preventing me from over-indulging too much!!!!! Our wedding day went like a dream....with thanks to our wedding co-ordinator, Nora. Our ceremony was held at the Palace just across the road from the Tequila and palatial it certainly was, though a little quiet for our liking. The Tequila provided myself, my mum and my 2 bridesmaids with a golf buggy to take me from my room, through the lobby area and to the Palace which was great fun and provided a wonderful photo opportunity for many of the other guests at the hotel. We were serenaded by a mariachi band before and after the ceremony which cost a little extra, but was worth every penny!!!...and the hotel gardens and private beach were a perfect backdrop for our photos. All in all our wedding couldn`t have been any more perfect and we have the Riu Tequila and Nora to thank for that!!!! I can`t help but be astounded at other reviews where they consider the walk to the beach an issue. It takes 10 minutes at the most and is more like a nature trail. The wildlife we spotted along the way was worth the short stroll. I`m sure we were relaxing on a sun lounger with a long drink in the time it took some people to wait for a ride in the golf buggy. The beach was like paradise, palm trees, white sands and turquoise sea, a scene I`ve only ever dreamed about. Just gorgeous!!!!!!!! The only downside to our time at the Tequila was when our nephew cut his foot open in the pool. The management were extremely concerned about the accident and cleaned the pool immediately. The cause of the accident was never found but the manager took the incident very seriously and offered my sister-in-law, her husband and the 2 children a free weeks holiday at any Riu hotel in the world as compensation. We cannot wait to return to the Tequila....I`m counting the days. We`ve even requested the same rooms as last year and the staff were happy to oblige. All of our wedding party had a fabulous holiday and are extremely jealous that we will be returning in 6 weeks!!!!!!

Our group consisted of six faimilies staying in seven rooms. The grounds were nice and well kept, as were the rooms. However, there were some problems associated around property maintenance issues and management's lack of customer service skills. During our stay, it rained several nights and five out of our seven rooms leaked to varying degrees. In one of our rooms the water flooded under the door soaking everything on the floor throughout the entire room, in two other rooms the water leaked down the wall, and again in two different rooms the water leaked across the ceiling running down the ceiling fan anf finally dripping and soaking the beds. The next morning we spoke with Hotel Management concerning this issue and after being routed through three different claimed managers, their response was \"well, we are sorry, but no more rain is in the forcast so don't worry\". After an additional day of discussions with management, we were finally able to change the two rooms that were leaking on the beds. Our assigned dining table was located on the patio under a roofed section of the main dining hall. We were placed here, becuase management claimed that they were unable to seat all of us in the main hall. This was acceptable to us, so we accepted. The seating was fine, but once again when it rained, rain water would leak through the roof and drip from the ceiling landing on our dinner plates and or heads. Hotel management was notified of this problem, witnessed the problem first hand, and did nothing to correct it. We tried to take this all in stride, but these were major issues and management's lack of response was just amazing. The hotel managers could work a shell game like the most seasoned boardwalk flim-flam artist I have ever seen. By the way, it rained three of the seven nights we stayed at the resort, so these were not just one time incidents. Couple these problems with clogged shower drains that were never cleared, wet bedding that was never changed, and dead remote control batteries that were not changed, and the daily reporting of these incidents to Hotel Management and the total lack of prompt response and corrective actions, I am unable to recommend the Riu Tequila to anyone. The Human Resource Department for the Riu Companies should immediately rush down to the Riu Tequila to provide the Hotel Management Staff with some much needed customer service training, unless of course your standard operating procedure is to offer a guest with a complaint a bottle of champagne, in which case I would then advise your procurement department to order more champagne.

We are an European couple in our late 50's and really enjoyed our stay at the RIU Tequila. We bought so called baggage tour from a travel agency, so there isn't much to say about the flights, transportation and the check in. All were arranged in advance and went quite well. Here comes some other observations. Hope these are for some help. The Room Our room was on the second floor in the second last building from the lobby. However we didn't think the couple of minutes walk to the main restaurant was too long. The balcony was nice but without light at night. So I couldn't sit there reading some book and sipping drinks before going to bed as I use to do in vacations. The insects were no harm to us. However we allways kept the mosquito net closed while we were on the balcony. My wife got some mosquito bites now and then. I had none. Perhaps I'm too bad of taste. All rooms have the same greenish colour. Some like it some don't, but who cares. You aren't supposed to stay in room longer times except while you are sleeping and you can't see the colours then anyway. We didn't recognize any special smell in the room and the maid (he was actually a man!) kept it very clean every day. The missing lamp in the shower room didn't bother us. There was enough light through and past the plastic courtain and the dim light made it easier for us to observe sun tan we had gained during the day than in straight daylight. I found out that every iron part in the shower room was deep rusty. That or the possibility of an electric shock are perhaps reasons why they never asembled a bulb in the shower room (but why not in the balcony?). Mexico is a country with shortage of clean water as most southern countries. In the room there is a note of saving water as we also did. But why they have mounted in the toilet some american made toilet bowl that uses two or three times as much water as ours in home and have to be flushed twice before it's empty of excrement (it's a real \"---- merry-go-round\")? As a whole the room with it's free minibar and spirits was good, I'd classify it to about 4 star level. Maid (most of them seemed to be men) Although tipping is rare in our country (Finland) and was totally unknown some 30 years ago, we tipped the maid (in the end of the stay as is custom in Europe). They make very good work. The room was allways cleaner and in better condition than what we are used to in Europe. However we were told that maid's wages is about the minimum, that is less than 4 euros (some 4.x dollars) per day! You can't live with that in Playa del Carmen because the prices are as high as (or more than) in our european countries (where also maid's salaries are many times higher). Also we were told that the Playa hotels are mostly owned by Europeans. They should be ashamed of that kind of exploitation of the labour. There isn't much difference between the prices of the hotels in Playa and in Europe's tourist beaches. We tourists pay a lot of money to the hotel and that goes to the pockets of the owners, not much of it goes to the people who are doing the true (wonderful) work in hotels. Pools Pools are big enough but shallow. That's why there were allways children and half drunk adults playing and moving around everywhere. I am a quite good swimmer and like to exercise by swimming. No change. The water purity was also suspicious especially in the afternoons. Lack of paint here and there didn't bother me at all. I think that RIU Tequila goes to renovation soon anyway such as RIU Yukatan now is (Tequila was constructed 1999, Yukatan 1998). I hope they'd make the other pool (without pool bar) deeper for swimmers only. We usually don't roast ourselves on \"hamacas\", so no comments about the lack of sun beds, their reservations by towels or situations of beds. The possibility to borrow hotels pool towels was nice (even to the beach we used much). Most european hotels deny the use of hotel towels outside the hotel rooms and tells to bring own towels. Beach Absolutely the best part of all. Nothing like that I haven't found anywhere in Europe not to speek of my own country. There it's often impossible to swim in the sea even in the summer. The water is too cold and too clouded for snorkeling e.g. as is in our 80000+ lakes too. The Caribean sea is cristal clear and has nice turquoise colour. I have seen nowhere corresponding. We really did spend a lot of time in the sea, on the sea (all the non-motored water equipments were free) and by the sea and loved it. I even swam long distances in the sea. No problem with the goggles on and when the sea was relatively calm. The walk from the hotel to the beach (somebody here complained) is a very short step for a man and about nothing to the mankind. We used to walk along the beach in swimsuits and think that it is the best way of sunbathing. However the beach was too short to both directions (usually we like to walk some 10 km/6 miles or more at a time). In one direction there was rock at the end and in the other a house built up to the water! That kind of house construction is not allowed in our country (although beach walking is mostly impossible because of other reasons). We also made snorkeling trips to Puerto Morelos and Xel-Ha. Just great! We can recommend those warmly, but look out where to book. Some agencies prefer your money to your satisfaction and the timetabels are too rushed. Somehow the pawement to the beach (between the hotels RIU Palace and RIU Yucatan) is drawn into wrong place in every hotel maps we saw. It (and the whole hotel complex/Palace & Yucatan) goes more to the south. That was no problem however, except at the first day. Some US citizens have criticized here Europeans who show themselves half naked (for example without bra) by the beach or pool. It didn't bother us and certainly it does no harm to the children to see any nudism. The free guns are far more dangerous. However we kept our swimsuits on because according to maxican law it is forbitten to go naked in public places although mexican authorities seem to tolerate it in the tourist areas. Restaurants There are 3 of them. In all the food is mostly good (personal opinion) and there is a great variety - something for almost anybody. However the restaurants aren't 5 star class (as aren't the rooms neither) - well worth the money anyway. Some of my countrymen who stayed in a cheaper hotel in downtown Playa d. C. told that their staying became more expensive as a whole than those who had booked RIU Tequila All Inclusive. Eating and drinking as well as in RIU Tequila may become more expensive in a non-AI hotel or in neighbourhood in downtown. So remember this when you plan a trip and search for a hotel. We ate twice in the Mediterr\u00e1neo (seafood) and once in La Lupita (meat). Food in both was good and the service excellent, but the menu stayed the same all the time and there was choise only with the main dish. The early 7 o'clock booking didn't bother us because we are \"early birds\" anyway. In the (northern) summer time (off season in Playa) there is no difficulties to obtain a table even later. To put some critics towards our American fellow travellers for our European's part I'd say that it shows bad manners to sit in the dinner table with shorts, T-shirt and with a hat on head as we saw some US citizen do (shoveling food in only with fork is just a slight deviation of the etiquette ;-). I am very unhappy to notice that these habits are nowadays spreading into and in Europe too, especially among the youth which seem to imitate everything from the USA without any critics. There was also so called \"junk food\" in the restaurants. We didn't touch it as we don't ever. In my opinion it is as dangerous to the health as tobaco smoking and should be forbidden at least in good restaurants. Of course I understand that demand sets the supply, but who greates this demand? \"Mr. McDonald\" your should be ashamed! I have no complaints about the opening times. There should be enough for anybody. Three meals a day is more than adequate for us. We didn't even think of snacks. Warning: Look out the black yellow eyed birds (there are everywhere) while you are in the open air restaurants (Mediterr\u00e1neo, La Lupita and Jaliscos terrace). In one of the first days we gathered food on our plates while lunching in La Lupita and then went to catch the drinks. When we came back to the table, two black birds were eating our lunch! It is very stupid of people to feed wild animals. They become tame and a nuisance for everybody. That might be also dangerous for the animal itself if people's nutrition doesn't fit into it's food smelting or is otherways bad for the animal. When we talked about this with the waiters they agreed us 100%. Please, don't feed wild animals unless you really know what you are doing. Other animals We saw there a lot of wonderful butteflies some very big and other insects of course. In the park we saw a mammal that looked like a bit boar, rabbit or rat. That's an agoute. We also saw opossums (don't know if the name is right in english) and iguanas besides some others we didn't have time to recognize. These were fortunately of no harm at the lunch table. ;-) Entertainment and Bars Some of the shows are good some less good. None was bad. The evening in the hotel ends about at 11 p.m. except in the disco. The \"music\" in discoes is however usually far beyond our ears tolerance, so we wouldn't go there anyway. We also go to bed mostly at the latest 12 o'clock p.m. There are 4 bars in Tequila that serve besides tequila almoust any international drinks you can mention. By asking they make doubles or other \"personal drinks\". The barmen are fabulous! In spite of very growded bar in the evening (show time) they mix your drink in a couple of minutes. In less pushed times they show you some unbelievable tricks with bar equipment. Tip them - they have really earned that and in addition their salaries are small too. Excursions If you are interested in history, as we are, the Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1, Tulum and Coba at least are worth visiting. Take a lot of water or soft drinks with since there is hot (especially in summer and inland). There are plenty of more mayan ruins in Yukatan, but those mentioned above are the most interesting within moderate distance from Playa. About other excursions I'd mention Xel-Ha which is mostly a place for swimming and snorkeling in a wonderful natural lagoon (also ancient mayan sacret place) or for wandering on nature trails. Another \"must\" is Xcaret amusement park, where you can snorkle or swim in the underground freswater river or in sea, see different type of wild animals, history (for example built up mayan village buildings and real mayan ruins), mexican-mayan cemetery (really worth visiting) and a lot more. At 7 p.m. there is also an excellent 2h show which ends the day. It's well worth staying a couple of more hours (nothing else is going on after 7 p.m.). Hint: Because both Xel-Ha and Xcaret are closed areas with rather high entrance fee the cheapest way is to go there by own arrangement (bus, taxi, ...) and buy the ticket at the entrance. The restaurants and device rents inside are rather expensive (compared to what they give to you) so bring your own snacks, towels and snorkeling equipment with you. We used backpacks. There are plenty of fairly cheap lockers inside the areas to keep the things in. Overall RIU Tequila is a good 4 star level (officially 5 star) hotel with very pleasant and helpful staff. It is worth every euro we paid for the stay - warmly recommended to anyone who isn't looking for absolute luxury. Don't just remain in the hotel's area. In the neighbourhood (within a couple of hundreds km/mile radius) there is a lot more to see and do. Best time to travel is (northern) winter because the climate is then less hot and humid, but be aware of more growd and higher prices. I am sorry for possible linguistic mistakes in the text. English isn't my own language. However it's always worth learning, speaking and writing foreign languages. I speak also spanish, and it was for great help in Mexico (people outside tourist areas seldom speak english). I think we have got much more of this trip as an average english speaking tourist.

Throughout our stay all members of staff did whatever they could for you. They were friendly and all worked very hard to meet the needs of guests. The animacion team were always encouraging people to join in activities that were being put on throughout the day. There was always something to do there despite weather conditions. Four out of the fourteen days that we spent at the Tequila it was raining but the staff did their best to ensure activities were put on and people had something to do. Our room was really nice, spacious and clean with plenty of room to store luggage etc. The beach was fantastic and spent a lot of time there. We booked several excursions whilst we were there including Tulum, Xel Ha, Fat Cat, Chichen Itza, and Coco Bongo's. All of which we thoroughly enjoyed. The food was good. I am not a huge fan of hotel food but there was always something to eat. The food was nice but after a few days we became a bit bored of eating in the same place each night so went into Playa Del Carmen several nights to different restaurants. A lot was on offer all day everyday but having so much food and drink available put me off (slightly). We had a fantastic holiday in PLayacar. I would not return here for another holiday because although we enjoyed it we did everything that we wanted to do it two weeks. The weather was nice but sometimes tempramental. We went to Cancun for a night out and on another day. IT certianly was an experience, but i was glad that i had chosen playa del carmen to stay in.

When we arrived it took 2 days for us to get a hold of the wedding co-ordinator to discuss details as we were getting married 2 days later on May 19th. Once we got our meeting we discussed things that we would like during the ceremony and the reception. Everything we asked for we either did not get or was screwed up. At the wedding the judge was late and they had another wedding planned right after ours and pushed us out before our pictures were taken. At the dinner we had asked for a head table for the wedding party, we did not get this. We paid for an extra bottle of champagne, we did not get this. With our package we were supposed to get a spa package, a fruit basket and a special gift. We did not get any of this until we complained. When we did get the spa package it consisted of 1 fifteen minute exfoliation for 1 of us. Our fruit basket came 1 week after the wedding on a styrofoam plate, and we never got our special gift. We asked to speak to the hotel manager and his response was that there was nothing he could do as he was not in charge of weddings and that we should fill out a travel advisory on the resort. Now as a far as I know managers are supposed to have some control or say in all situations related to the resort. When we got there we had to take a blood test as part of there rules. We asked prior if we could have copies of the test. We did not get them. When we asked about them they told us they could not get them for us. We inquired as to why and were told that they had been sent to the doctor already. After complaining 3 times miraculously, they told us they would have them for us the next day. If you are going to this resort for a vacation I would highly recommend it as it does offer alot and makes you feel very comfortable being there.

They even make little towel animals to place on the bed. The resort is extremely clean. There are resort staff walking around constantly taking care of that. The food is excellent with a nice variety to where you can eat something different each day. It is like eating on a cruise ship!

Where do I start ? We were anxious having read some of the reviews mainly from USA holidaymakers - rest assured all anxiety vanished when we reached our room with 2 large double beds, separate dressing/ shower area including tequila, vodka, rum and gin in the optics and a fridge packed with water, corona beers, coke, lemon, soda and tonic. We ran out of tequila and that was replaced immediately everything else was replaced daily even though it says it will be restocked every 2 days. We kept the mosquito nets on the patio doors closed at all times and had no insects in the room or any bites in the room but we did see loads of people with large insect bites., We used very strong insect repellent every day and every night religiously and would recommend the same - only got bitten at xel- ha and tulum a few times but the mosquitos were out in force there!!! Having only been to Cuba and the Dom Rep before in the Caribbean, we were not expecting the food to be up to much. How mistaken we were- anyone who says the food here is bad needs to get a life!! The food is magnificent! From running salad buffet, guacamole, prawns, to Mexican bar to Carvery section to Fish section to pizza/chips/ desserts/cheese n biscuits, fresh fruit, cakes, icecream, pancakes, waffles, steak house what more does one want?? fajitas if you want with home made tacos etc etc - only drawback would be if you want a full english breakfast they dont do baked beans or tinned tomatoes although they do attempt crispy bacon and english sausages a close second but definately edible!! Evening meals there is always an carved ice display beautifully decorated and every sunday morning Cava for breakfast !! Now complain!!! The hotel is set back from the beach behind the rui yacatan which unfortunately was closed for refurbishment but this worked to our advantage as there were fewer people on the beach and using the tequilas beach bar and restaurant facilities. it is about a 10 minute walk to the beach but there is a little golf buggy which runs up and down all day if you dont fancy the walk. The sight of Iguanas and possums every morning made the walk worthwhile and it is all shaded under trees and there are benches if you need a rest! The bars were open from 1000 every day and included international brands as well as local - just ask if you want Bacardi, Ballantines, Bourbon, Smirnoff etc and they give you doubles no problem. The pool bar does get a bit excitable late afternoon especially as when we were there , there seemed to be a Canadian or UK wedding every day which ineveitably resulted in Tequila slammers being Slammed louder and louder until the waiters ended up in the pool with the wedding party fully clothed!! If you are diver as my husband is, there is a perfectly decent padi dive club at the hotel which is not very well advertised on the net. Very reasonable - good sites, boat dives, with plenty of eagle rays, turtles, etc and as we normally go to the red sea this time of year he certainly was not disappointed. The sea was as you imagine a bit rough but clean, crystal clear and a sandy bottom no rocks or stones but shelves very quickly so quite dangerous for small children especially as the waves do crash on to the beach! Only thing is if you like snorkelling you need to go on the trips as there are very few fish to see in front of the hotel beach. We travelled with Portland Direct which undercut Thomson by \u00a3400 each for the same holiday. We thoroughly enjoyed the hotel, the people, the food, the sea, we went to Cozumel on our own which cost about \u00a39 return on the ferry from playa del Carmen and did Tulum with the company.On our last day we sat and tried to think of anything we could find to complain about .......difficult but 1, no Baileys or anything similar 2, very very humid 3, bitey things got us in the end !!!!

This is the best resort that we have ever stayed in (and we've stayed in Disney world!) The rooms were lovely and big, clean, fantastic air conditioning and we have to mention the most excellent optics including Gin, Vodka, Rum and of course Tequila. The maid service is great and we got a towel animal almost every day. The hotel staff are so very accommodating and nothing seems like too much trouble. The bar staff are incredible to watch, as they pour out the most amazing cocktails and we hardly had to wait to be served. They work so hard and yet remain so polite. The food has to be mentioned. It was a gastronomic delight. Every night the buffet would have an amazing selection of dishes, all wonderfully presented and so very tasty. There seemed to be a different theme every night with foods from around the world, but if you felt like having something simple there was always chips and pizza. The mediterranean restaurant at the Beach club was lovely and we would recommend going for the early sitting so that you can watch the sea as the sun sets while you eat your dinner. The Steak House was okay, but if you are a vegetarian I would stay well away. We had no problem booking a table in either restaurant, as they always seemed to be able to accommodate us. The pool and beach areas are fantastic. The pool is surrounded by trees, which give most welcomed shade at around midday (depending on where you are sitting) There was the odd leaf floating in the pool, but there was a member of staff clearing them out on a regular basis. We never had a problem getting a sun lounger by either the beach or the pool. In fact the beach was lovely and quiet, which was probably due to the fact that the Yucatan resort is currently closed which shares the beach with the Tequila resort. Trips - we went on the jungle tour, to Chichen Itza, Tulum/Xel-Ha and on the Island cruise and they were all brilliant and well worth the money. Some advice, if you go to Chichen Itza the coach will stop just before it gets there at a road side shop with souvenirs - don't buy anything as it is all over priced. Once at Chichen Itza you can buy the same stuff and more and it is so much cheaper. Entertainment - outstanding. The evening shows are great and the dancers are incredible and do about 5 or 6 different dances a night for each themed show. I would recommend the Horror show, as the fire display is fantastic. Day time entertainment is varied and good fun. We could go on forever on how lovely this place is, so I just have to say that if you have booked this resort for your holiday, you will not be disappointed. We miss the place already and would definately go back. P.S. You will see creatures that look like small deer /guinea pigs on long legs while you are there (picture attached).

Besides the food is that good, an excuse to walk it off should be taken as a plus not a negative (there are some lazy bones out there).

This was our 4th trip to the Mayan Riviera and this was my least favorite hotel, however it was still quite outstanding.... Some things to be aware of that may you may not know.... The Tequila is not located on the beach but, unless you are lazy that is not a problem but - because it is located off the beach it is much hotter than a hotel that is on the beach. The grounds are tremendous however, because of this we were eaten alive by mosquitos which has never been a problem for us before. We always travel during the first or second week of May so I don't really think the bugs or heat was worse than in the past it was just that there is so much jungle around. The plus side of the jungle surrounding is ANIMALS! Beautiful birds that I have never seen before in Mexico, iguanas and lemurs by the dozen that I was able to hand feed (they love grapes). There were also dozens of these strange sort of rat/rabbit things - I am not sure what they are but they they are definitely NOT wombats as I heard another suggest. DUH? The food was fantastic at the buffet retaurant (open for breakfast and dinner) as well as at the beach and pool snack bars. We only ate once at the Steakhouse (pool) and it was pretty good. Something interesting about the dinner buffet is that you choose either the early or late sitting and are therefore assigned the same table every night, it forces you to be social with those around you because you see them every night - unless you are completely anti-social this makes for a lot of fun. We were fortunate enough to be seated near a Brit couple who we ended up chumming with throughout the evenings and having quite lovely chats along with lots of drinks. Roger and Sally - thanks for the memories! Talk to you soon. The beach is beautiful however, if you are looking for calm waters go farther done the Mayan Riviera - nice waves here to play in. We had read several reviews that said how horrible the rooms were..... those folks must have been used to the Waldorf.... Yes, they are a bright green but, very pretty and very comfortable. Also read reports about the lack of television channels...What do these people go on vaction for? There was ABC, NBC, MTV, CNN and the BBC as well as several others. A helpful hint, if you are going on vacation...leave your room now and then, get some exercise - you can sit in a room and watch TV at home. Most of the staff was wonderful however, there were a couple nasty ladies at the front desk who were very unhelpful. Lastly, we only went on one excursion this time because honestly, we have done the others on the others trips - we went on Fat Cat which is a Catamaran/snorkel trip. The snorkelling was not the best but, the catamaran ride there and back was FANTASTIC! Lots of rum punch and cerveza, throw in some snorkelling, some BOOM NETTING, fishing and swimming - it was great! We also parasailed for the first time - WOW! All in all it was a great trip and you really shouldn't be dissappointed if you go. As for the ladies at the front desk...we were trying to get a late check out because our flight did not leave until 10pm - we asked every day and were told something different everyday, the hotel seemed to be overbooked so we did not get our extension, that was the only thing that was unpleasant. For the Canadians out there.....Sunquest overrates the hotels in their books - that was the general concensus for everyone travelling with them (at different hotels) on our return trip. Also, Sunquest uses Canjet which was great but, they get horrible departure times.....if you can avoid arriving and especially leaving (from your trip) at night, I would strongly suggest it - if you can extend your checkout time at the hotel ($$$) it is ok but if you can't it really ruins the last day of your trip and you usually sit around for hours and hours waiting to go home - not a great way to end things. Also this hotel was VERY European... the Brits are great but the others not very friendly and quite rude to the staff that work so very hard for very little pay. Yes - it is all inclusive but passing out a couple dollar bills here and there will not break the bank! Finally, if you are considering going to the Mayan Riviera some suggestions: Iberostar Hotels are out of this world! Also stayed last year at Bahia Principe Tulum - WOW! Barcelo Maya Beach is very good as well. If you want to see ruins - Chitzen Itza is a must, Coba/Pac Chen is also great as is Tulum. Xcaret is incredible - go through the underground rivers and make sure you stay or return for the nighttime show! Xel Ha is also quite awesome.

Make sure you see the Michael Jackson show. It's really good. Just remember, he's not the really Michael. The rest of the show were just ok. Nothing special. The audience participation shows just before the main shows are pretty funny. Make sure you go to them. The strip mall down the street is nice. The prices in downtown Play del Carmen are much cheaper and they have the same stuff. Don't forget to barter. You have the last say. Just walk away and they will say ok most of the time. Watch out for the sharks. They all have great deals. One guy went up to my daughter and said he remembered seeing her at the RIU hotel. He said he could get her a great deal on her next vacation. She believe him. Of course I stepped in and said lets go. She said she could not believe he remembered her. I told her he looked at her RIU bracelet and that is how he knew she stayed there.

We spent most of our time at the beach but had no problem getting a chair at the pool if we got there by 9 a.m. or so after we finished breakfast. The staff was very friendly and attentive to any needs and they were always cleaning and keeping everything neat. We had a problem with our room safe the first day and that kept us in the room for an extra hour or so which was not fun after a day of traveling but the repair man was apologetic and hurried to find a lock that would work properly for us. The room was nice...we didn't notice any musty smell at all. The beds were firm but we slept fine and were not uncomfortably hard. We did have a long walk to get anywhere as we had the building the fartherest from everything so by the end of the week that got a little old but overall not a big deal. The food was good but also by the end of the week we had had enough and were ready to get back to our normal food. We ate at the Mediterrano restaurant one night, overlooking the beach and the atmosphere was great, especially as it was much quieter than eating at the buffet. The food was pretty good although the buffet had alot more variety. The fajitas and the fish at the buffet were great . The weather was nice. It would be cloudy on and off but suddenly be sunny and we did not see a drop of rain the whole time we were there.

About 10 minutes after we arrived, the front desk clerk needed a document we had in our travel packet, along with return tickets, vouchers, etc. We handed him the document, and inadvertently the packet as well. Concluded our business and went to change and head for the pool. 10 minutes elapsed, then we discovered we had left the travel packet either in his hands, or on the counter. GONE. No big worries, except we did have $200.00 US in there, but took that loss as the way it goes. We did immediately get the travel agent rep, SunQuest, involved, but were 100% assured there was no problem to replace the lost tickets, have a good week, don't think about it again. Checked back with him on Thursday, and again, he assured us the rep at the airport would get the new tickets output for us - at a fee of $25.00 Canadian. Remember, this is just the paper ticket - we already had confirmed seats, fully paid, etc. Got the airport at 11:30pm Sunday April 24, immediately found the SunQuest rep, who smugly advised that it would be $50.00 Canadian. I commented that I had no problem to pay the $50.00, but that I thought it was outrageous, since it was simply reprinted from the computer at the desk, NEVER EVEN HANDED TO US, but used by the seating agent to confirm we had a reservation, then onto the passports. So, I handed him the Visa to be done with it. NO, cash only, and sorry, \"we don't issue receipts\". OK, having been careful not to have a handful of cash (either pesos or US) by the end of the trip, I was told I would have to find an ATM - nice. Where is it? A 10 minute walk down a service road to the next terminal, since they have NO ATM's at all in this building. Off I go, leaving my wife and daughter to wait. 20 minutes later, I am back with the obligatory $500 pesos, since he would not tell me exactly the amount in pesos, hoping and asking instead for US. I found him and gave him the $500 pesos. He shook his head and said sorry my friend, now I want $1000 pesos. Choice time, kill him and live my life in a Mexican jail, or walk back and fight this battle with SunQuest when I get home. Its late, we are very tired, so I make the trip back to the other terminal. Low and behold, now NONE of the ATM's work, despite having just dispensed $500 pesos 30 minutes earlier, and the security staff tell me they rarely, if ever work, and that ALL THE SUNQUEST STAFF KNOW THAT. Now what? I hire a guy to drive 15 minutes to a gas station that he thinks might have a working ATM, which it does, and he returns me to the airport with 25 minutes to spare. I hand the $1000 pesos to the rep, and tell him to choke on it, determined that if he uped it agian, there was going to be an international incident, right there. I boarded the plane and came home. Lesson; if you happen to loose your tickets, which I imagine might be a fairly common occurance, be sure you have ample cash at the Cancun airport, or better still, avoid using SunQuest and their high rolling gringo cowboy thug at all, might just make for a perfect vacation. At the very least, please, ask before you leave what the tour guides replacement policy is, and how much it will cost. GET IT IN WRITING.

We spent 10 days there. April 9 -18. The resort is very pretty and extremely tropical. Lots and lots of trees. Very pretty to look at. The one downside was because of all the trees alot of the chairs by the pool are in the shade. You are either going to get morning sun or afternoon sun. Yes it is also true that you do need to get up fairly early to find a chair. Alot of people reserve chairs (which you are not supposed to do) and then they are not seen all day. I would recommend buying a cheap blow up floatie that you can lay on in the pool so you can get sun when ever you want. There are also alot of leaves that blow into the pool. (No big deal they are just leaves) Swim up bar was very nice. Drinks were good and the staff is friendly. The lunch buffet at the pool resturant was always very good. Big selection. The gucamole is wonderful as well as all of the salsa's. The rooms at the Tequila are very average but clean. Yes they do smell a little musty, but you have to remeber that is due to the climate not because they are dirty. If this bothers you, bring an air freshener. Two twin beds pushed together. Bar was always well stocked and if not just call the front desk and they will bring you what ever you need. The main buffet resturant was always very good as well. Lots and lots to choose from. Breakfast and dinner are served there. Sometimes it could be a little warm in there. No air conditioning just ceiling fans. Our only complaint was that when you first arrive you have to pick either a 6:00 or 8:30 seating. You get the same time and table for your entire trip. I know it may not sound like a big deal and we did not think it would be either, but you get busy with you day (trips, shopping ect) and sometimes you want to eat later or earlier. Not enough flexabilty. We have stayed at several Riu's and have never run into these types of specific seating arrangements. Their computer system also does not update frequently enough and they have everyone checking out after 7 days. So that means alot of the tables end up being double booked. We were questioned several times as to our reservation time and what our room # was. We had braclets on so we found this to be very annoying and quite rude in the middle of dinner. The shows very good. I can not comment on the disco as we did not go. The walk down to the beach is not a big deal. Although my husband would have prefered to stay closer to the beach. The Riu Yucatan is a very nice facility and if we were to return we would stay there. It has the nicer beach than the Riu Playacar. Unfornutely for us the Riu Yucatan closed for renovations during the time we were there. We could still use the beach but we were really limited on drinks. They will be closed for 3-4 months. Keep this in mind when booking your vacation. You will want to use their faucilities. The Riu Playacar is also very nice. Great pool. There beach looks as though it has been washed up considerably. So unforunatley there is not alot of beach front. Acutally most of the resorts beach fronts are minimal except for the RIU Yucatan. The ocean is very beautiful and everything you have heard. The color of the water is something else. The little town of Playa Del Carmen is very nice and worth the trip. Lots to do there. Check out the Blue Parrot. $4 US cab ride. All and all we enjoyed our vacation very much. The RIU Tequila was a nice resort but we would stay at the RIU Yucatan if we returned.

The Tequila really is a good value. Our room was clean and in good condition. Landscaping and architecture wonderful. Take your own blowdryer, as you need to continuously compress the button on the in-room one to keep it working. Couldn't get a lather out of their shampoo, and no conditioner supplied so suggest you take these items. We followed advice and requested (in Spanish) specific rooms, but were told on arrival that they couldn't accomodate our request. We were given a choice of two rooms, both pretty far from the action, and in the end it hardly mattered. I didn't mind the firm beds. but I would be strongly attracted to a resort offering two queen sized beds in future. Our first few nights the last-standing spring breakers were pretty disruptive in the wee hours. I would steer a little wider around the Spring Break period another time, as the Tequila bar and disco attracts all the young singles from the four RIUs in the area. It is an entertaining scene until they are all drunk and screaming outside your room at 2:30 am. Fortunately, they all went home shortly after out arrival. We were pleasantly surprised by the food. The choice was great and always changing. The desserts, including a nightly hot specialty were wonderful. I never had room to try everything I wanted. Contrary to reports of no snacks, the lunch buffet was open til 5 or later every day. After four they started to downsize it in prep for the evening steak house set up, but there was pizza, fries, fresh fruit, desserts and all kinds of other food available until just about an hour before the first dinner sitting. We took the first sitting and requested a table on the terrace. This was a little further from the food, but really pleasant, and I recommend it. If you choose a seat outside for breakfast, however, you should be prepared to share your food with the birds. The evening shows were pretty uneven. One, a review of show tunes was pretty impressive. My kids enjoyed the mini-disco activities that started around 8 or 8:30,and also like some of the feature shows that I didn't enjoy, so I guess they were appealing to every taste. I was just happy to be sitting on a beautiful patio on a warm night surrounded by people enjoying themselves. Finished every night with a fantastic Mexican coffee that definitely had a kick. Otherwise, I found the drinks were very weak unless you were quite specific about wanting more alcohol. We rarely bothered, and just had a few more if we felt the urge. I watched the bartenders closely on occasion and some definitely put no more than the smallest splash of liquor into the drinks they were serving to people at the swim up bar. But the staff were unfailingly friendly and hard-working. Instead of doing the all inclusive to Xel Ha and Tulum, we rented a car at the RIU Palace. It cost $75 for 24 hours. The AI price quoted to us at the Tequila was $US 103 per adult, half that for kids. We had our own snorkel gear, took a few sarongs to use as towels (not really needed in 90 degree heat) and paid a few dollars for a locker on site. We took a few freezer ziplocks with us, lined a carry-on bag with a towel, added bags of ice, pop and beer from our room fridge and made sandwiches at breakfast and popped them into our 'cooler'. Probably saved ourselves at least 100 dollars over the AI costs. TIP: We didn't find the river snorkeling very good. Too murky, no colourful fish spotted. However, as you approach the tram station that takes you to the top of the inlet, you cross a wooden bridge, and on your right there is a lagoon with steps to get into the water. This was by far the best snorkeling. Right around the steps and the rocks near the bridge we saw an amazing variety of colourful fish in very clear water. My kids are still talking about it. No one else was in the water with us there for quite some time, so it was really special. We were also amazed by the big ocean fish under the bridge at the opening of the inlet. Mayan Cave- very cool if you can choose a moment when it isnt' too busy. Afterwards we zoomed down to Tulum, but it was so hot that the kids couldn't enjoy it. It was great to have the rental car as we were free to do as we pleased, and when we were done, we didn't have to hassle with collectivos or wait for the tour bus to depart. The road was not busy and other drivers were courteous. This was the easiest and most all-around enjoyable vacation we have taken as a family. I thought it was a really good value. The beach was one of the best I've seen, and I've seen plenty. Also, the weather seems to be much more dependable than some other vacation spots. I have more than once experienced a bad week of weather in Hawaii, but I get the impression this rarely occurs in the Yucatan. If I have one significant criticism of the Tequila, it is that the kids club, advertised for 2-12 year olds, provided almost no activities geared to the older kids in that group. Every time I took my kids by the kids club area, there was a couple of very little girls colouring or making paper bag puppets. My kids wouldn't stay a minute. The animacion staff - who worked their tails off 12 hours a day - came around frequently signing up those 13 and over for various activities. But, except for some stage productions which required hours of commitment, few organized activites were offered for the 8-12 year olds. My ten year old, in particular, wanted to be involved in everything and was sometimes turned away and directed to the kids club, where nothing was happening. My husband and I would have loved it if there was even one two-hour period each day ( or every second day!) when we could confidently leave our 8 and 10 year olds in a group of age- appropriate supervised, organized activities and go for a bike ride, a sail....or a nap. Didn't happen. It was a family vacation in every sense of the word.", "Date": "April 14, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Macomb,MI", "Title": "\u201cGreat Vacation\u201d", "Author": "MsTravelerMI", "ReviewID": "UR3348147", "Content": "We just returned from Riu Tequila April 3rd from a 1 week stay.

The food was good and we could always find something we liked even though we got tired of the buffet for breakfast, lunch and dinner. We were surprised at all the young teens with the drinking wristbands on. There was a lot of teen drinking at the outdoor bar (where were their parents?)

We sat in a very long line. After a 2-hour stand still at the airport security lines open, and we board the Apple Vacations charter USA 3000 from Cincinnati. Yee haw! We were a group of 10 (two families) and ended up just using the Apple transfer to the resort which was included in our price. After a quick stop at the Iberostar Tucan/Quetzal, we arrive at the Riu Tequila our home for the week! Check-in:We arrive later in the day. Turns out we were not able to get our 4 rooms in the same building as requested via email. They communicate it is likely we can move next to our friends the following day which is exactly what happened. A big plus for traveling to Mexico is that our friends speak Spanish in their home. Spring break:Turns out the Riu Tequila in the evening is the party place for the Riu resorts during spring break. The disco opens at 11:00PM and packed with 16? to 21? year olds. Not sure where some of the parents of these younger kids are \u2013 but during the day there is no wild behavior. We were not bothered. Rooms:Our room was a very good size with two double beds pushed together. Refrigerator well stocked with Corona, Pepsi, Orange soda and large water bottles. We have been spoiled by the rooms at the Iberostar Paraiso, but not having to pay the high season Paraiso Del Mar and Lindo prices make our bathroom conditions at the Riu Tequila just fine! Service:As we have experienced before, the Mexican people work very hard at their jobs. At the Riu Tequila we did find a few of the workers were a tad grouchy and could have been friendlier, but I know the resort was at full capacity and I\u2019m sure the weeks at this time become very tiring. On the majority, service was very good. The bartenders at the lobby/theatre bar were fabulous!!! They are SO good at what they do. Watching them is like watching a finely tuned piece of machinery \u2013 incredibly fast, interdependent and so accurate. Food:First and foremost the Riu Tequila breakfast and dinner buffets are outstanding. We actually enjoyed the dinner buffet here better than the Iberostar Paraiso. A la carte is another story\u2026 Iberostar has them beat, but our kids did enjoy the steakhouse so much that we ate there twice. Choices at the Steakhouse are top sirloin steak, ribeye steak, hamburger, surf and turf (steak and shrimp), simple linguini pasta, and barbecue ribs. For the buffet we had chosen the 8:30PM seating, but easily was changed for one night when we wanted to venture into Playa Del Carmen in the evening. To book the Mediterranean or steakhouse buffet, one must get up early to reserve (7:00AM). This is most definitely inconvenient for many but not for my hubby who wakes early. Best of all with the dining at the Riu Tequila is that the attire is casual. Our teenagers could wear shorts to any dinner \u2013 which meant no fights between teenagers and parents in this family! Pool:The size of the Riu Tequila pool is great, the availability of loungers during high season is NOT great. The pool was not cleaned throughout the day and the water became less than desirable. Quality of the pools is much nicer at the Iberostar Paraiso, but again I must mention that we were not paying Iberostar prices so I\u2019m not complaining. Beach:It\u2019s true that you must walk across the street in Playacar to use the beach at one of the other Rius, but we did not find this to be so inconvenient. Once over at the beach either using the Riu Palace or the Riu Yucatan, we would eat lunch and visit the bar at the Riu Yucatan. Location:I\u2019m really liking the Playacar location. The proximity to Playa Del Carmen makes it easy to spend an evening in town, and for brief, close-by and quiet shopping the Plaza Playacar has a lot to offer. One evening after the early dinner buffet, we grown-ups walked into Playa Del Carmen. After walking 5th Avenue and buying cigars, we ended up having a drink while listening to a great band at Los Rancheros. Xel-Ha:Prebooked through the internet we snorkeled for a day at Xel-Ha, and some of us swam with the dolphins. Prearranged transfer with AGI, and we enjoyed our time with Julio our driver. Xel-Ha was crowded (of course spring break), and I found the water to be murky due to the excess of people. Still we had fun in the water all day. The dolphin swim was cool, but it does bother me a bit that the dolphin company seems more consumed with getting a lot of staged photos and selling them than focusing on the dolphins. I shouldn\u2019t complain though as I just perpetuate the madness by buying the photos myself! Overall:The front desk upon our request gave us a pass one day to tour the Riu Palace \u2013 lovely! The Riu Tequila is not the same caliber as the Iberostar resorts where we have stayed before in Mexico (except for the dinner buffet!); however, the value of the Riu Tequila and the casual atmosphere for vacationing with teenagers were just the right qualities we were looking for during the high season of spring break.

To those of you who complained about this property - consider spending several thousand dollars more and stay somewhere else, maybe then you will find true happiness. enough said. This was our 5th all inclusive vacation. We generally don't revisit the same property twice (just to many places with to little time) but we definitely would like to go back to this one. We took the advice from a Mpls review and requested building #9 (thanks for the tip). We weren't on the 2nd floor as recommended but our 1st floor balcony was surrounded by nice trees and shrubs which provided us with good privacy. If balcony privacy is important to you then the 2nd floor is where you will want to be as very few 1st floor's offer this. The noise from the hallway echoed into the rooms so keep your fingers crossed that you get quiet considerate neighbors. What I loved: The beach is beautiful - 2nd to none. No erosion problems here as there is at other properties as you walk north along the beach. There are more then enough lounge chairs, but yes, if you want one near the water you'll have to get there early. I had no problem sitting back a bit from the water under one of the many swaying palm trees. These were available any time during the day. There were several choices of food offered at the breakfast, lunch and dinner buffet and I found most of it to be very very tasty. To bad some tourist have no common sense when it comes to proper etiquette at buffet lines. I had to remind someone to use the serving spoon and not their fingers (were you born in a barn or what!). The two reserve restaurants were a nice change as you could sit and be served. The Beach club restaurant (mainly sea food) had excellent salmon. Our favorite was the steak house, the steaks there were as delicious as any fine steak house at home. What I didn't love: Getting up each day prior to 7 am to reserve dinner. I too was taken back by one person making reservations for a party of 20 (come on, make one person from each room do their own reservation to keep it fair)! Also getting up early to reserve a lounge chair was a pain. There are signs saying not to do this but the rules are not enforced so you do what you have to do to get a chair. Regarding spring breakers - this property clearly promotes the fact that they do not cater to spring breakers. So, explain how they all got there!! Many young adults (high school as well as college students) drinking to excess. Funny the property doesn't feel responsible for their well being and cut them off. Helpful tip: If you can find room in your suitcase bring your own pillow as the pillows there were very hard. I did & slept like a baby.

THE GOOD: 1. The resort staff is very friendly, always \"hola\" with a smile. They work hard at their job, whether it is cleaning up guests frequent messes around the pool, clearing your plate at dinner or coming immediately with beer to restock your refrigerator when empty. 2. Of the 6 nights we were there , 3 nightly shows were very entertaining. I dont expect Las Vegas or Bway in a Mexican resort so I was moderately impressed. 3. The tropical foliage surrounding the pool and rooms is beautiful. They are constantly grooming the landscape. One day however, a strong smell of pesticide was evident in the air. 4. The beach was GORGEOUS! The sand was white, the water blue, the lounge chairs somewhat plentiful, the waves awesome! You are able to get drinks and lunch right there and the sister Riu which is quite convenient. 5. Location.Convenient walking distance to Playacar and Playa Del Carmen. Within the resort, I also found everything conveniently located. We were in building 5 and did not think this place was spread out as mentioned in other reviews. THE BAD:1. The food...uuggh. The buffet dining room is like a giant cafeteria. The food almost always the same, some things good dont get me wrong , but some things were definitley unidentifiable. Breakfast was the best...omelets, pancakes, french toast. Overall it just didnt seem sanitary. My husband saw people picking food up with their fingers, eating at the buffet stations...that's all part of the buffet scene I guess. Never made it to the \"steak house\"...just didnt seem worth the effort. They need a better system for reservations. One person can make reservations for other families or unlimited number of people. After dinner there is nowhere to get food. There is also no food between 3 and 6:30PM. There is NO SNACK BAR! There is burned popcorn and tortilla chips available at the pool restaurant. 2. The pool needs to be painted. The pool area where the pool bar is had filmy crud floating in it on daily basis...sunscreen, dirt from the landscape and pee? The lounge chair area is limited. I sat on the concrete for 6 hours watching my kids in the pool next to 2 vacant lounge chairs with towels thrown on them. All the chairs are saved by 7AM. There are signs indicating not to save chairs, but who enforces anything there? 3. FAT CAT. We booked the day trip on this catamran which was to include snorkeling, riding in the water on the ropes. Couldnt do those things because the sea was so rough. $275! It should have been cancelled. 4.Spring breakers. Since The Tequila has a reputation for fun and has a disco, the place is infiltrated with spring breakers at night (from the other Rius too). They are 5 deep at the only bar open. Cant even get a drink! I feel like Ive complained a lot but we did have a good time.

The hotel was very nicely kept and we never smelled that disinfect smell that has been very prevalent at other AIs in the Yucatan. Our room was very pleasant and we had a great housekeeping staff (whom we left 10 to 20 pesos for every morning). Food: Breakfasts and dinner buffets were very good. I thought there was a very good selection of different items every day. One thing that I absolutely LOVED was that there was an entire line dedicated to Mexican food! Imagine that! The selection was different every evening, so I never got tired of it. We were not there for most lunches, so I cannot comment on them, but I assume the food was decent. I read that there was no snack bar, but it seemed to me that there was always some place to get food (more than just nachos and popcorn) from early morning until late into the evening. We did not eat at the restaurant(s) and this would be one complaint I had. We did not even know about the restaurant(s). No one mentioned anything about them. Also, when we checked in, we were not given our dinner table time or seat assignment. So the first couple of nights, we just chose a table and then were shooed away from it when the \"owners\" of the table showed up. It took us a couple of nights to get the staff to really explain how the whole process worked. But, that was no biggie...in fact, my husband and I joked about being seated at the \"dunce\" table until we were capable of figuring out the system. You can also eat breakfast/snacks/lunch/drinks at the other two Riu hotels (Riu Playacar and Riu Yucatan). But be aware that you can't eat dinner there (remember the assigned seat and time thing???). Additionally, you cannot go across the street to the Riu Palace unless you have a \"pass\", which you can get at the RT front desk, but it only allows you to visit...you can't get any food or drink there. There was also a \"tour\" of the Palace each day lead by one of the RT staff members. Drinks: I have to say the quality of the drinks was marginal, but I was not discouraged as they still exceeded my expectations, which were not high to begin with! I have found this to be the case at most AIs: the drinks are okay, but never great. I think the ones made up around dinner were better than those I got in the early/late afternoons. Entertainment: We don't have kids and generally don't participate in this kind of stuff, so I can't really comment. I did enjoy watching the water aerobics (on the days we were actually there mid-morning). They also had a swimsuit fashion show one afternoon which was fun to watch. We also caught the kids show that ran right before our 8:30 dinner time and that was really fun to watch too. I thought the staff seemed to be doing a very good job maintaining a lively spirit throughout the day. Beach: Anyone staying at the RT should be aware of the fact that it is NOT on the beach. But all you have to do is cross the street and walk down a very nicely paved path (open to guests of the Riu hotels only) to get to the beach. Also, the RT has a little shuttle that will take you there. I thought the pool at the hotel was very nice, but you do have to get there early to reserve a spot if you want to be very close to the pool. Shopping: The RT is very close to the Playacar shopping area which has some cute shops as well as some touristy ones. There's also carts selling all sorts of things. There's an ATM that dispenses only pesos (that concerned some people standing in line in front of me...not sure why this surprised them so much?) and a rental car/scooter place. My absolute favorite shop was one that sold seashells. They were absolutely beautiful (so some of them came from the Phillippines...I don't care!) Overall, I think the RT is a great hotel for the price (at least the price we paid). The only reason I would not go back is because I'd like to try some other hotels.

We are fans of the resort (thus the return this year) and having stayed there 4 weeks out of the last 54 we have a lot of recent experience. The tequila is special because of the staff. The friendly service and enthusiasm for their jobs has been a real treat for our family, as my 5 year old continually told me, Mexicans are really friendly. However please be aware of the following (and management please take note!): Rooms: The beds are really uncomfortable. Unless you are subject to a tequila induced coma, you'll find the beds very firm and scratchy, the hotel should drop the plastic mattress cover. Other than the beds the rooms would compare to a Best Western in North America. Food: For the region, the food is above average. We've found it worth the wait to sign up for the steak house, the food is above average, the service is not sophisticated but in availability and enthusiasm is first class. The food in the main dining room is quite good, big hint - ask for a dining table outside on the verandah, it is a much more enjoyable experience compared to eating inside the main room (tip the Maitre'd). Also the line up's for food from the north end kitchen are always smaller and they serve excellent mexican cuisine there! You really will not find food much better in the area, for example in the restaurants of Playa Del Carmen, (and if you're looking for a well prepared steak and a nice bottle of Cabernet - forget it, instead indulge in local seafood and mexican quisine!) Facilities: This was our real disappointment this year, the Tequila was built in 1998 and is really starting to show its age. The pool needs to be repainted and there are many tiles missing, the permanent umbrella's are falling over (termites) and are not being replaced, the sofas in the main reception area are torn. The transmission for the golf cart that is used to transport guests from the hotel to the beach is now controlled via a cable at the real of the vehicle as the main lever and cable has broken and has not been repaired. There are a few light bulbs and ceiling fans in the common areas that were broken for our entire stay. None of these issues will prevent you from using the facilities or enjoying them, but they are indications of how the resort is aging. I get the feeling the hotel chain is goingto ride the resort from a self described 5 star to a self described 4 star over time - be aware. Entertainment: For young children (2 to 5) there is a nice kids camp. The evening entertainment is campy but fun. This is no club med, but you'll get out of the daily activities what you choose to put into them, the entertainment staff try to engage anyone willing to have a good time. It would be nice if they had some 'inside' activities for children ages 5 to 15 to get them out of the sun and out of their parents hair for a couple of hours. The tv channel selection in the rooms caters to locals, some other hotels in the area have air conditioned rooms where older kids can play video games or watch movies - there is nothing like this at the Riu Tequila. Overall: We have enjoyed our cumulative 4 weeks at the Riu Tequila, We love the all inclusive approach but will look for a newer hotel for our next vacation. If you find a really good deal for the Tequila, then stay there otherwise, take a serious look at the newer hotels in the Mayan Riveria.", "Date": "March 27, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Ontario Canada", "Title": "\u201cGreat for families\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3294726", "Content": "I am sure that you're excited about going down to the Riu Tequila.

Drinks in room: Refilled every day with the 4 main spirits and lots of Corona in bottles. Pools: 2 of them, of which the one with the swim up bar is fabulous. Great selection of drinks and you can taste the liquor, no watering down. The other pool has water aerobics and is a little quiter. Who needs quite? Entertainment: Hilarious. A couple of the shows were really cheesy. Especially the Grease Musical. They lip synced and the girl singing \"Hopelessly Devoted to You\" had the words on a piece of paper while holding her pillow. The comedy night where they spoof songs and artists is very well done. We were in stitches. We were grateful that the performers did the best they can; let's face it, English is a hard language and they did a good job trying. Kid's Club: They play darts, tennis, colour, swim. Always supervised and the kids pool is surrounded by sand so the parents can get sun (we did!) and relax while the kids play in an extremely shallow pool. Beach: A five minute walk, 10 if you have little ones like we do, and is large and stunning. The pictures in the magazine don't lie. The water really is that colour. Shopping: Great little street down the road from all the hotels has the same items that Playa del Carmen has only you don't pay the $4 US for the cab ride. Tipping: The housekeepers were great, the drink refillers were great, and the bar tenders were excellent. A couple a bucks for the bar people and $10 for the week for the cleaning staff is always appreciated. Leave behind some of your Wal Mart sandals you paid $5 for. They'll use them. Trips: Definitely go to Tulum for the Ruins and Xel Ha for the snorkeling and salt water swimming. Excellent deal. Summary: It's fun, very clean, very relaxing and decently priced.

I read ALL of the reviews before I left. I really wanted your opinion about where I was going to vacation. That is why I am going to write my opinion ( with all honesty from my heart! ). The only thing true about the information I got from this review section before I went was to ask for building four. I have travelled to about 2 dozen all inclusives. We go twice a year with our kids (16 and 12). I have been to many places that are good and not so good. I can not understand why so many people gave this a five star rating. It was not bad but there are points you should know before you book this. The animation staff was by far the worst we have had at any club. They are virtually non-existant. There is a board posting what will be going on for the day but most events never happen. It is very quiet by the pool. There is not even music most times. The shows are not very good. I know they work hard but I have been to many places where the shows were better. There were people wandering the lobby until the show since there was very little going on. The food. It was actually not bad. There was pretty much the same exact lunch each day. It was good. I had my salads and there was lots of fruit but no variety. I would say breakfast was the best and I do not usually say that at about a resort. THERE IS NO SNACK BAR. Do not let anyone lead you to believe that there is. They have popcorn and nacho chips and cheese. That is all. Dinner was fine. There were LONG long lines to get the food but once you got it it was not bad at all. Again..... alot of it was the same from night to night. There is a steak house but I had to wake up at 6:30am to get a reservation. They start signing up at 7. If you come at 7..you will get no reservation. I was fifth in line and was the last to get the sitting for the 7 PM dinner. I could not figure that out. ( It was not that good...eat at the buffet!) The rooms were clean. The staff was pleasant. The grounds were kept up very well but the place is getting very tired looking. There are tears in the lobby sofas. The pool needs painted. It is older now. It was a grat location. That was the only truth I found on this site. I am sorry. IF you knew me you would know I am not a complainer but this is not a five star. Try the bahia principe, the moon palace, the crown paradise., the paladium, the iberostar. Those are five star. People were bored and it was sad to know we all paid so much and felt this way. You better wake up early to get chairs by the pool but this is usual in these resorts. Just get up and hold your chair and relax and it is yours for the day. I could go on and on about this place but I would say there are so many places to go that are so far superior for the same price avoid this place. It was not awful but there is so much better ..there really is! Email me if you have a particular question.

You should also plan a whole day to go into Playa Del Carmen. There are about 15 blocks of stores, and don't take the first price they offer you!

The service was pretty good, and the staff there is really friendly. We did a few day trips - snorkeling, horse back riding and a visit to Xcaret. The days we stayed at the hotel all day were very relaxed - the pool is nice, and there are things to do, but as a single mom with a 9 year old we were kind of the oddballs. There were a lot of couples with small children there and not too many kids my daughter's age, so the programs they have available didn't really fit.

The atmosphere is fabulous and the treatment wonderful. We couldn't believe how beautiful the grounds were - it was just like being in a jungle paradise. The wonderful people working on the resort are extremely professional, courteous, warm and hiliarious in some cases. We can't complain about anything - the food and drinks were top notch and the nightly entertainment was 10 plus. A couple of nights the dancers needed a break so they had the audience participate which made for an interesting sight. There is so much to do in the Riviera Maya with simply walking to Playa del Carmen for shopping or taking in an excusion or two, or jumping on the ferry for a short trip to Cozumel. One week wasn't enough but we are so glad we had a taste of this tropical paradise. And the beach is a short walk or ride if you need, but beautiful and everything you need simply by asking.

I had originally booked the Riu Lupita but upon arrival was told they had overbooked and they would like to send us to their sister resort The Tequila. Because I was travelling without my husband (or any other adults for that matter) I was nervous but had no choice. Well, imagine my surprise when we pulled up to the Tequila. Immediately I had people helping me (and not because they wanted my tips!!!). They helped with the girls, they helped with my bags, apologized for the overbooking problem, provided me with details on how to access everything, and gave me a stroller to use for the entire 8 days. It gave me a wonderful warm feeling; I was pleased to be there. Every night the food was spectacular (try the paella!!!!!); not only did they have numerous choices but the quality was great as well. The kids program was really good. It was pretty laid back (try not to be too hung up on start and end times as they do not seem to mean the same thing there that they do here). My 6 year old had a wonderful time in the program, especially the day that they coordinated a routine for the theatre stage. My only complaint would be that the rooms are not sound proof. I would like to make a request that people keep their voices low in the hallways as they carry straight into the rooms. Generally this was not a problem however the man yelling to his wife down the hallway \"Did you get the video camera?\" and the resulting marital dispute was not appreciated at 7:00am. The pool area was plenty big enough with more than enough lounge chairs for everyone (never had to wake at 6am to put towels on a chair. The most wonderful thing about our trip was how we were assisted when my daughter fell ill with an ear infection. There was a doctor on staff who we were able to see immediately. He prescribed some medication which was delivered to the hotel lobby. I was then assisted by the hotel staff in reading and understanding the Spanish medication instructions.

They wanted to be closer to the beach. We found this to be a non-issue, the walk from the Tequila to the beach between the Palace & the Yucatan took no time at all & it was a beautiful walk with an occasional monkey sighting. Our expectations were exceeded in every respect. We'll break it down, one thing at a time. First the beach. Yes, it is true, the beach is in tough shape from the Allegro through the Riu Playacar (dropoff from lounger area to the water at the Playacar was about 6 feet)...the beach at the Yucatan was where we hung out. Restaurant (buffet only, we never tried the restaurants requiring reservations) - We made reservations for early seating (6:30pm), you can show up any time from 6:30 - 8:00 to eat, we found if we got there about 6:45-7:00, the lines were shorter. Once you're assigned a time & table (only applies to dinner buffet) the system works slick because you can just walk in to eat, no waiting to be seated. For lunch, wide variety to choose from at all three places. We enjoyed the fact that we could just go from Playacar to Yucatan to Tequila. Food - Last year at the Allegro we were tired of the food mid-week, whereas at the Tequila we looked forward to our dinners because we knew there would be something fun and exciting to eat, everything from octupus to prime rib to stir-fry to fresh salmon.Many differnet salads and a wide variety of food; beverage choice offered to you by your private server. We met one of the directors of the restaurant, Marek Vancek, who made our dining experience very enjoyable!!! Everyone in the restaurant was so accommodating and personable, really made the whole dining experince wonderful..Ivan was also most helpful and fun.. Here's a recommendation, no, actually I insist on this...try the coconut hard serve ice cream, I had it every night after reading about it on previous reports, it is out of this world. Staff - Everyone from cleaning staff, to front desk, to servers, to bartenders were extremely helpful and friendly (never\" looking\" for tips). Entertainment - The shows were fun, Michael Jackson show is a must-see at the the Playacar. The shows were very entertaining for young and old. The disco was great, enjoyed by all ages, played large assortment of music. Room - We were in building 9 (915), second floor, facing the pool. We had sent e-mail prior to arriving asking for building 4, 5, 8 or 9, second floor. We brought copy of their reply to show at front desk & with no hesitation they filled our request. These four buildings are closer to front of resort. Grounds - Kept clean & perfect.

We visited in late August 2004 and have travelled to lots of places. People told me before I went that it would be wonderful but I just thought yeah, it'll be nice but it's only a holiday, how wrong could I be. When you walk into the reception area, it is so beautiful and you are greeted with a fresh fruit juice and instantly get a feel for just how friendly the people are, every single members of staff throughout our stay always greeted you with a smile each time they met you. I had no complaints about the rooms despite reading other reviews, they were lovelly. They were cleaned daily, beds pulled out and cleaned behind, towels, sheets etc., changed daily, fridge topped up with beers and soft drinks etc. and not to mentioned the beautiful towels sculputures left. We also had 3 children who had taken teddies and the cleaning staff used to sit them up and put them giving each other piggy backs etc and they were different every time, they also left them lollipops and things much to our kids delights. The pool area's were gorgeous, yes they did get a bit dirty at time, but staff were constantly walking round with nets cleaning the pool. There were ample beds, people did reserve them by placing towels on but you could always get a bed somewhere. Didn't like the swim up bar much as this was a bit smelly and there were swarms of wasps flying around it, and this was also a problem around the kids vending machines for fizzy drinks. The food was fantastic, there was always a really good selection and everything was warm and tasty. Breakfast omlettes cooked fresh infront of you and filled with ingredients of your choice. The buffet restaurant was set out in 3 sections 1 having typical meat, veg, potatoes etc., the middle section being more pizza, hot dogs, chips etc., and the 3rd section being fajitas, nachos, and all the other mexican delights. The trick is not to try everything but to stick to a set meal so as not to get repetitive. The outside barbeques were absolutely wonderful with chicken, steak, ribs, pork chops, corn on the cob, baked potatoes etc mmmmm. I would definately recommend the steak dinner that you have to reserve, this takes place in the outside buffet area around the pool and the meal is soooooooooo nice, as is the atmosphere. Your table is set with candles, wine glasses etc. and you start with soup and bread rolls, then they bring a platter of nibbles eg. ribs, corn on the cob, cheese in breadcrumbs, etc., then your main meal of steak, salmon, shrimp, mashed potatoe, followed by gateau. There was also a seafood restaurant but we didn't have time to do that one. The beach is also beautiful, lovelly and clean and the sea is just like you see on the postcards. Although the hotel is not right by the beach, we went here a couple of times as you just walk to the front of the hotel and a little golf trolley vehicle takes you free of charge, although the walk is also very nice. There is a little shopping area just about 1/2 a miles as you walk out of the hotel which is nice to walk around, or you can catch a taxi into the larger shopping centre just about a 10 min drive away. Finally, the entertainment - this was so fantastic! The shows were brilliant, there was Moulin Rouge, Grease (this was fab), Michael Jackson (this is the best) amongst others, the staff were really professional and worked so hard. While I was there they also did a kiddy version of Grease the musical which was just the best thing I had ever seen, I am slightly biased as my 3 kids were in it, my son being the lead part, but everyone was cheering so loud. Anyway i'd better stop now, I could go on, but one last thing if you feel like a good ole booze up, try Tequila boom booms, and Mexican flags but make sure there is someone capable of carrying you back to your room.

The bathroom had just a shower (adequate pressure and temperature) and a separate room for the toilet (which came in handy with two adults and two kids in the room). The dining room was beautiful but hot. Selection of food was great (albeit repetitive night after night). Smoking is allowed everywhere so make sure you ask for a non-smoking table in the dining room if you prefer this.

Our room (3222) faced the busy street which was loud at times. Pool area was very busy and the smell from the restaurant (in the middle of the pool area) was a bit overwhelming at times. The pool needs a new coat of paint. The food at the buffet was great but we got sick and tired of the same stuff all the time. Service was slow (even after we tipped our waiter). To make matters worse, they would serve the leftovers in the restaurant for lunch the next day. The beach was beautiful but busy and very, very windy. My five-year old son could not swim in the ocean unaccompanied because the waves were too strong. Shade is limited on the beach.

It was a wonderful vacation for all of us and a dream-come-true for my mother to celebrate her 50th birthday with a cocktail in hand on a beach. We are big fans of RIU hotels and have stayed at several of their resorts worldwide. The Tequila has become my favorite so far. Although this hotel is not directly on the beach, it does have the nicest pool of all the RIU hotels in Playacar. I especially enjoyed the lush vegetation and palm trees around the pool and the beautifully manicured grounds of the entire property. It is about a 10 minute walk to the beach along a designated walkway or you can pass thru the other RIU resorts on your way to the beach, which gives you a chance to check them out. The beach in front of the RIU Palace and RIU Yucatan is also the nicest and best kept. We walked up and down the shore at Playacar and it seems that the beaches are being \"washed away\" by the ocean. Some of the other resorts had very narrow beaches (packed with vacationers), that dipped down about 3 feet into the water. Then there were big sand bags roped together to (I assume) keep the sand from washing away. Very ugly! The beach in front of the RIU complex however is gorgeous and it is obvious they try hard to upkeep it. The rooms at the Tequila are very clean and nicely equipped with a mini bar and fully stocked fridge (beer, sodas, water, mixers). The only negative thing were the showerheads, which were ancient and should probably be replaced. The food in the hotel was great. We really enjoyed the daily buffets. The Steakhouse (Specialty Restaurant) was a little disappointing. You have to get up early in the morning (7-9am) to make a reservation if you want to eat at one of the Specialty Restaurants that night. It simply was not worth it, when the buffet (no reservation required) has food just as good and so plentiful every night you can not even try it all. The staff at this resort is topnotch, especially the waiters and bartenders. We were fascinated watching the bartenders night after night running around the bar like crazy trying to make all the \"inclusive\" drinks and play-fighting over who gets to take someones order, when (being an All Inclusive hotel) tips are not even expected. The RIU Tequila has their own team of Entertainment coordinators and dancers, who put on nightly Las Vegas style shows/parties, which are alot of fun.

I admit I have nothing to compare this experience with as this was our first 'real' vacation; but, I do know that the service we received was beyond excellent from all of the staff. The grounds and facilities were being constantly groomed and cleaned and each staff member always had an Ola! for us in passing. We went with 2 other couples and although one couple had difficulty with their room (bugs) it was fumigated promptly with an offer to move to another room also. The rooms were tropically fun although the beds were a bit hard - didn't notice much as we were exhausted each night. Wet bar well stocked with beer and liquor dispensers!! We didn't drink much liquor but had no trouble getting extra beer. The bartenders are friendly and always smiling - they like it when you attempt their language to order. The swim up bar was a tad cold as it is in the shade, however after a few drinks you don't notice much!! There was always something to join into if you were so inclined - you could be busy the whole day!! The night entertainment, what we saw of it was ok - the Michael Jackson show the best one. We had a good time one night at the disco also. We ate at the a la carte Steak house - very good. Buffet was good variety, not gourmet. We ate one night in Playa del Carmen at Capitan Bob's and Sons - outstanding meal!!! My husband and I took 2 out trips - one to Tulum/Xel-ha and the other to Coba. We would highly recommend taking a full day to go to Xel-ha and for the Coba trip go with the tour group Alltournative - excellent experience and guides!! Our friends did the parasailing on the beach and loved it!! The beach is beautiful (the walk is not even worth mentioning unless you have small children or are infirm). Get there early for loungers if you are a large group - before 10am - otherwise you can always find one or two to drag to a spot. A few topless wonders on the beach as well - not all pretty views!!! We took an upgrade to the Riu Cancun (in Cancun) and will definitely not go back there. Our rooms had a sliver of an ocean view and one of the couples with us demanded a move that took quite some time to work out. The beach was very windy and whipped sand up all the time (both days). The heated pool was good, but lots of people (highly treated chemically). The service at the Riu Cancun could learn alot from the Tequila folks - not an Ola! in sight and it took us forever to get a drink at both the pool bar and the lounge!! No smiles either! Cancun hotel strip is very commercial and we understand great for partying and bar hopping; I can do that in Toronto. Can't wait for our next trip, we are already planning!!

This was our 3rd trip to Mexico and 2nd to the Mayan Riviera. If you have booked the Riu Tequila, you will not be disappointed. From the moment we arrived we were in heaven. Easy check in, no long lines. Our luggage was brought to our room immediately. The lobby was stunning. Open air concept. The grounds were absolutely beautiful. Pathways through out the resort were immaculate. There was never a moment where you didn't see employees cleaning. The rooms were typical Mexican rooms, nothing elaborate, but hey, who was in them except for sleeping. Very clean, A/C worked perfect, in fact, we were chilly a few nights. Fridge was stocked with pop, corona and water. Never a problem getting more. The buffet was the best we've ever been to. Tons of selections and different every night. The atmosphere was the nicest I've ever seen for a buffet. Also great service. We ate at the Steak Restaurant (overlooking the pool) twice. Would highly recommend it. We didn't eat at the Mediterian restaurant but heard it was very good but did not have as nice an atmosphere. The staff were terrific, always accomodating. Lots of activities if you wanted to participate but they never forced you. We went to all the evening shows and regret to say that they were a bit amateur compared to others we have seen but in the most were entertaining. The animation team worked very hard. Michael Jackson tribute is a must to see. Lots of tables and chairs to sit at but have to get there early to get good seats. Now a couple of negative comments. The pool was quite cold. It is not heated. The nights were a big chilly so the temperature did drop in the pool over night. Nights are getting warmer now, so hopefully that won't be a problem for anyone going soon. Lots of shade and lounge chairs. I have never met such ignorant people as the Europeans. They constantly push in front of you whether it's at the washroom, shuttle or buffet. I had read other reviews that made the same comment and thought that they were exagerating, but they unfortunately were not. You try to tell them not to bud in and they pretend they don't understand you.....after a couple of days we just ignored them and tried not to let it upset us. I would rate this hotel 4+ star. Although we thought the resort was fantastic, I would not go back. This resort is part of the Riu complex and is across the street from the ocean. If you don't mind walking 10 minutes or waiting for a shuttle (which our friends enjoyed) then I would highly recommend this resort.", "Date": "February 10, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Windsor, Ontario", "Title": "\u201cTequila was great...upgraded to Palace\u201d", "Author": "Brimnerclan", "ReviewID": "UR3166860", "Content": "We arrived at RIU Tequila on January 28th. Our room wasn't ready when we arrived...so we had lunch, then checked in. Our room was 604, and was ideally located - close to lobby and restaurants, and to the pool. It is a ground floor room, and simple. There was a slight musty smell, but I brought room deodorizer, so that was a non-issue. On our very first day we received a message that the Tequila was over-booked, and we were offered an upgrade to the Palace. We thought it over for about a mili-second...and quickly agreed to move. In the meantime, we enjoyed the pools, the restaurants and the bars at the Tequila. The food was great! Lots of selection at the buffet. The Meditteranean Restaurant at the Yucatan was very nice. The employees of the hotel are phenomenal. They would do anything you asked, and better than you could imagine. The property looked like park land. Tequila is definately the nicest of the Playacar, and Yucatan group. Many more families, thus more children...but it didn't bother us at all. Monday the 31st of January was moving day to the Palace. This is where my report turns into a dream. Please know that if we returned to PDC, we would definately stay at the Tequila....however, our time at the Palace was amazing. We were given suite #16. Gorgeous room with separate sunken living area. Bathroom had marble counters, water closet with toilet and bdaie, a large deep bath tub. It was a lovely room....with slightly nicer beds than the Tequila. Premium liquor stocked daily. (in fact one day the bar service knocked on the door, asked if we needed anything...they passed in a brand new bottle of Jose Querval Tequila - no questions asked. WHOA! The entire hotel is elegant. You must register and dress for each of the MANY restaurants. Our favourites were Sir Edward (french) and Myagi (Japanese). That said...the buffet at Don Julian was spectacular. Items like caviar, prawns, beef wellington, duck, calamari, and frog legs were nearly a nightly staple. Champagne was always flowing. The piano bar was lovely. The guests were typically older than us (we're 30), most were in 50's plus. The staff were incredible!!!! We've never tipped more in our lives. This hotel is located on the beach...so we definately took in the beach much more than we would have had we remained at the Tequila. My hubby took a kayak out, and we used the paddleboats. My husbands favourite place was in the hammocks on the beach for a siesta. We were definately in awe of this entire time. We know we didn't 'deserve' this, but we enjoyed every minute. We kept pinching each other thinking it was a dream. So...bottom line is I have NOTHING negative to say about our vacation. The Tequila is fabulous for the average traveller looking for fun in the sun, with good food and fabulous service. If the Palace is more your style...well, then you'll enjoy this high level of service, food and ambiance.

It was absolutely amazing! Just perfect..from the food to the service! Then entertainment staff worked so hard to keep everyone busy and having fun. The evening entertainment was superb .. First class professinal entertainers that is for sure. Just make sure you go early to get a good seat. Tequila Rui has beautiful grounds and lounging areas. The main lobby is awsome all open concept with couches all around to sit and relax. Wonderful bar at the pool and the main building. The buffets were superb...I have a very picky husband when it comes to food and his plate was always full. best beef tenderloin ever. Our server was sooo good as well. make sure you bring lots of smaller bill for tips. The staff all work so hard. We enjoyed beautiful towel creations on our bed every morning after they cleaned. THe rooms were a little musty..I was unsure of that at first, but they were soooo clean and never did I see a bug or creature in my room. We never had a problem getting lounge chairs around the pool or the beach. The beach is a five min. walk ..buts not a big deal and if you cant walk it...a shuttle comes...although at times you have to be assertive as we had an experience where a guest pushed my husband off. So be assertive if you have to. We ate at the steak house once as we had a hard time getting up early and ready to book it. It was a great experience as well...but we still loved the buffet the best. The veges and everything was just so good. For entertainment we saw a Macho Man ~ it was an audience participation thing ..very funny. We saw the magic show, Las Vegas, A tribute to Musicals, Michael Jackson and I cant remember what else but it was all very good. Good dancing ! I loved doing the Riu Fiesta Dance after each entertainment ..it was fun. We did a few excursions...XCARET, XELHA, Golfing, Dolphin swim at Dolphin Discovery! I highly recommend doing your dolphin swim there. We watched the dolphin swims at the other places ..and the groups were larger and you didnt get as much time with the dolphins as we did. It was fantastic ... 5 of us in the group and we all did the foot push and the fin pull....as well as play time ..it was great. XHEL was a nice relaxing day ..floating down the river on tubes...snorkelling...hanging in hammocks right on the ocean...XCARET..I found quite busy ...trying to fit everything in ..in one day. We did the sea trek where you walk on the bottom of the ocean with a big helmut thing on giving you air to breathe. It was pretty neat..we swam in the underground river...which was very cool. We didnt stay up too late while were there...even though we are night hawks ..because day light hours end at 5 so all the pool activity ect. dies then. The pool gets cool at night when there is no sun. So the one night we went to Cancun on the Pub Crawl..Isabel was awsome..she looked after 50 drunk people..oh the patience she had. It was a lot of fun seeing all the places. Neiher my husband or I got sick once while we were there..and we ate three big meals a day. We brushed our teeth with the tap water...drank bottled of course. No problems..room was very cool ..air worked well. I dunno I could type forever about it...we loved it. Everything was great.. I liked the internet cafe so I could write my friends and family while I was away. Enjoy your trip ..we definitly will be back!

This was our second trip to Mexico --- we had traveled to Mexico for our honeymoon five years ago. We did not stay at an all inclusive during that trip --- we stayed at the Hyatt Cancun Caribe in the hotel zone. That hotel was fabulous --- but we regretted not staying at an all inclusive since meals and drinks in the hotel zone were very expensive. My wife and I have not traveled outside the US very often, and this was our first stay at an all inclusive. About the Riu Tequila: Facilities: The resort was wonderful -- absolutely beautiful setting. Very integrated with the \"jungle\" surroundings...grounds were exceptionally well maintained. A beautiful resort. A quick word about the layout of the Riu properties...The Riu hotel group has four properties in PDC located adjacent to one another. Riu Playacar the furthest property to north, followed by Riu Palace and then Riu Yucatan, the furthest south --- all front the beach. Riu Tequila is across the street (non-beachfront) situated near the entrances to Riu Palace and Riu Yucatan. Guests at Riu Teuila have privlidges at Yucatan and Playacar...but not the Palace. The walk to the beach from Riu Tequila is a short leisurely stroll that is easily walked in 5 -10 minutes. There is a specially designated walkway for Riu Tequila guests between the Palace and Yucatan. We did not view the fact that Riu Tequila is not beachfront as a disadvantage --- much to the contrary --- the grounds, pool and facilities at Riu Tequila seemed to be a little bit nicer than those at Yucatan (we didn't visit Playacar during our stay). Beach: Very nice and clean. Anyone like myself who is used to taking summer trips to the Maryland and Jersey shore can appreciate how truly spectacular the beaches are. The water is perfectly clear...absolutely breathtaking views from the shore. The water was a little bit on the cool side, but I found it quite refreshing once you were in the water for a few minutes. We encountered no trouble loacating loungers on the beach. Seemed to be more than enough to accomodate all the guests. People who arrived during \"peak\" times when the beach was most crowded (10 am - 2 pm) --- simply needed to find available loungers and move them around to accomodate their group. Unless you have more than four to five people who want to sit next each other --- finding loungers is not a problem. Earlier posters who mentioned the idea about bringing insulated mugs for the beach were absolutely right. The cups they give you at the bar near the beach are very small --- you don't want to be continuously walking back and forth from the beach to the bar to fill your cups --- do yourself a favor and bring a generous sized insulated mug. Pool: Pool area at Riu Yucatan is very small. I can see how people would find trouble getting loungers their. To the contrary --- the pool area at Riu Tequila is quite large. Two huge pools are situated around one of the bar / restaurant areas in the center of the Riu Tequila. People do start reserving loungers at 7 am for the prime spots...but loungers seemed to be available most any other time of day...as long as your were willing to move them around to the spot you want. The pool area is quite \"shady\" with lots of trees and \"tiki huts\", so finding a spot around the pool that gets sun for more than 3 - 4 hours of the day is very difficult anyway. The pool swim up bar was great. We found the bar staff at this bar to be the most fun and friendly staff we encountered during our stay. Staff: Staff at the hotel was pretty helpful...service was generally good overall...especially at the bars...it is worth it to give tips to the bar staff and you get better service. Our room was very clean. Housekeeping staff did leave us towel art (we tipped about $4 per day). Restaurant service was OK at the buffet. We felt somewhat ignored...probably b/c we were on a shorter stay...they didn't pay as much attention to us. We ate at the Steakhouse one night and the service there was exceptional. Rooms: Fairly large...generous bathroom area with a nice shower...but this property is certainly not Hyatt or Marriott type accomodations. Previous posts about the beds were very accurate. My wife and I found the beds to be very hard and we didn't get a good night's rest while we were there. We requested that they add \"padding\" to the matress to make it soft, so housekeeping added blankets under the fitted sheet. This helped...but not much. I can't imagine spending a week or longer on the beds at this hotel. Fortunately I got a great massage at the Spa at the Yucatan the last day of our stay...and that helped relieve my aching back. Food: Not top notch, but pretty good. Buffet had lots of different food options to fit just about anyone's taste. We did eat at the Steakhouse one night. That was a great dining experience, however the steak is only marginal at best (not Outback Steakhouse quality meat). I can see that if you stayed longer than a week you would be eating the same things over and again, but otherwise the food service should be more than adequate. We didn't like the way this hotel had you schedule your dinner seating. The first day there you picked whether you wanted the early (6:30 CST) or late (8:30 CST) seating at the buffet, which was your assigned seating throughout your stay. We picked the early seating the first day, since 8:30 CST is pretty late for us for dinner. We disliked the early seating b/c the buffet was very crowded and there were lots of annoying kids at that seating. We switched to the late seating, that was less crowded...much more quiet...but we hated eating that late. You could do an \"ala carte\" dinner at your choice of two other small restaurants on the property, but you had to make your reservation at 7:00 AM with the maitre die the day you wanted to eat at the ala carte restaurant b/c the reservations for those places were filled up very early due to limited number of tables available. We did do that one night --- and that was a very nice dinner at their \"Steakhouse\". It would be nice if dinner arrangements were a little more flexible. I hate having to look at watch and live by a schedule when I am on vacation. I much prefer the freedom to go eat whenever I want to. Shows: Don't expect broadway or Vegas quality entertainment. Shows were generally quite \"cheesy\". My wife and I went on this trip for the sun and relaxation...so it wasn't like we were expecting quality entertainment. If you are expecting to be entertained every night...expect to be disappointed. Clientele: This resort caters to a very \"Non-American\" clientele. Europeans, Canadians and French Canadians far outnumbered Americans at this resort. As an American...expect to see some things that you are not used to seeing in the states...primarily seeing a bunch of grandpas in speedos and some grandmas sunbathing topless. For the most part this didn't bother us, however, be aware of it if you are bringing young children who may not understand people's choice of garments. Probably the worst thing we encountered during our trip...we witnessed an Italian (i think?) woman sitting by the pool allowing her three year old daughter to remove her bathing suit and urinate in front of the steps to the pool...in broad daylight in front of everyone else at the pool...what is that? I don't know any country where public urination is considered an appropriate behavior. There was a bathroom easily accessible from the pool area. This was disgusting. This was a family, like some others we witnessed, that allowed their children to run wild, unsupervised. Just one of a handful of displays of bad parenting we saw during our stay...it's ashwamed b/c most children we saw were pretty well behaved. We encountered a lot more smokers than we are accustomed to in the states. This was especially prevalent at meal times...and my wife and I can't stand inhaling smoke while we are eating. We were not told that there is a non-smoking area at the buffet...but be aware that there is a designated non-smoking area. If you don't smoke...request non-smoking...otherwise you'll be breathing second hand smoke constantly at dinner. Tours: We didn't do any since we were on such a short stay. We had visited Xcaret during our prior stay in Cancun and would reccomend that to anyone. Airport: Cancun international is bad...just expect it. It took us approximately one hour to get through immigration, baggage and customs during or arrival. I think we were fortunate...it would have been worse on a busier arrival day (Saturday or Sunday). AVOID PUSHY TIMESHARE SALESMEN IMMEDIATELY AFTER YOU CLEAR CUSTOMS. They are clothed in white uniforms and represent themselves as offical aiport personnel --- however they are not. They will stop you and pretend like they are helping you find your destination by showing you nice maps and jotting down a bunch of meaningless notes but this is only a shell game to get you listen to a lengthy dissertation which turns into a timeshare pitch in exchange for some worthless discount or free tour. AVOID THEM...IT'S ALL A BIG CON. Head straight to the exit doors without stopping --- all the tour representatives are outside the exit waiting to meet you and direct you to your ground transportation (unfortunately the tour reps can't step foot in the airport). Departure was awful. We waited in line for nearly 1.5 hours at the US Airways counter, before finally being informed our connecting flight from Charlotte was cancelled due to weather. US Airways personnel in Cancun messed up our re-booking (which took nearly a half-hour) as we were later informed when we landed in Charlotte. Airport personnel in Cancun will search through all your bags at check-in...be aware of this...and this only helps to slow the process. PLAN TO ARRIVE AT THE AIRPORT 3 HOURS BEFORE YOUR DEPARTURE...allow yourself enough time to make it to your plane...they have trouble handling the volume of travelers at check-in. Overall, the pluses far outnumbered the minuses and we can't wait to go back to PDC again. PDC is a wonderful destination...the beach was spectacular. We enjoyed this trip so much more than our last trip to Cancun. It was so relaxing and laid back...and the all inclusive was great...no worries about where to go eat or drink. I think we will choose a different resort next time...one that is more flexible with the meal scheduling and options...and one that is a bit more Americanized...but this doesn't in anyway take away from the Riu Tequila...it is very nice place to vacation.", "Date": "February 3, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Grand Haven, Michigan", "Title": "\u201cTequila Jan 22 - Jan 29, 2005.\u201d", "Author": "sunspotbaby752", "ReviewID": "UR3100500", "Content": "Just returned from a wonderful, warm, sunny week in Playa with hubby and two single adult children. For reference, hubby and I are early fifties and children are girl 27 and boy 23. We have been to this area before, staying once at the Gala and once at the Cameleon Marival (another name now). We truly lucked out on weather, as it was fantastic all week. Days were sunny and temps low to mid 80's - nights mid 60's to 70. We did have long sleeved to put on, which was needed. We were hesitant about the Tequila, as it is not directly on the beach. That turned out to be a non-issue. The tram to the beach runs every 20 minutes and takes only a few minutes to get there. If you walk to the beach, it is about a 10 minute walk. If you are familiar with some of the larger resorts, even if they are oceanfront it can take that long to walk to the beach due to size of area. The Tequila is a beautiful resort, well maintained. Very tropical surroundings, and beautiful pools, restaurants, lobby, etc. The following are my observations about some aspects of this resort. Food: The food was good, some nights better than others. But always a large variety - there were several buffet areas with fresh fruits, salads, cooking stations with roast chickens and other meats, fresh fish, chicken-beef-shrimp fajitas, and of course, desserts....way too many dishes to name them all. Breakfasts were wonderful, with everything you could think of being served. My fav was the cook to order omelettes. The fried donuts dipped in sugar were a hit with the son. We never ate lunch, as too full from breakfast. Did snack a little in afternoon at pool restaurant, which always had hamburgers, hotdogs, french fries, fresh fruit, and a \"hot\" food station with several dishes. My only complaint was the way the Riu's make you designate which seating time you prefer for the dinner...either 6:30 or 8:30. We chose 6:30, which was fine. However, I prefer to eat whenever I choose. Another insane thing they do is if you wish to go to one of the specialty restaurants, you must be up at 7:00 am to reserve your time and restaurant. Good grief, I am on vacation!! Anyway, we did do this for one night...went to the steak house. It did turn out to be a very good meal, well presented in a nice atmosphere. Also, a change from the buffet was nice. Rooms: The rooms were average. The bed consisted of two full beds pushed together. The bed and pillows were very HARD, which is typical in Mexico. The walls were painted a very bright but gaudy green. The bathroom was nice, the toilet in a separate room with door. Shower was nice, lots of pressure. They provided you with packets of bodywash, shampoo, soap, shower cap. Hairdryer is on wall. Refrig was in bathroom, with Corona beer, Pepsi, orange pop, water. Also a booze dispenser with 4 different bottles. Staff: Wonderful, warm and friendly. Very accomodating. Bartenders were a lot of fun, and we enjoyed spending our evenings at the bar just relaxing and meeting other people on vacation. I would say approx. 50% were U.S. and Canadians, rest were European..Italian and French. Other stuff, side trips: The grounds were beautiful, very tropical, and always being manicured. The pools were nice, but COLD. Lovely swim up bar, but too cold for me. Some were in it though. The ocean temp was about 85, so that is mostly where we spent our days. Went into Playa shopping one day, and one eve went to Blue Parrot with kids and few others. Wild place, definitely for the younger crowd, ha. Kids took the Cancun Bar-hopping tour thru Apple and LOVED it. They said it was best part of the whole trip. Hubby and I parasailed, was awesome view from up there. Took one day and went to Puerto Aventurous so kids could swim with dolphins (Dolphin Discovery) at the marina. Cab ride there was $14, and program they chose was $125. Spent about 45 min in water with dolphins. Very nice, and the area it is in is very cool. Lots of shops, bars etc surround the marina.

My girlfriend and I travelled to Mexico in July 2004, staying in the Riu Tequila. When we arrived we thought it looked nice and looked forward to spending our holiday here. Until we were shown our room. The rooms are no more than 2-3 star, they are small, bed sheets are dirty and the bathroom doesn't actually have a door. It has a curtain which you pull across. The pool is very dirty and could do with a lick of paint. If your not up at 7 am to get a sun lounger then you'll be forced to walk to the beach. Even if you do manage to get a sun lounger (which we did once) the tree's block the sun. So when you sit by the pool you are actually in the shade. The beach is the best thing going for this hotel. The walk is ok, but becomes a bit of a chore after a few days. After 10 minutes of inspecting our room we went straight back to the lobby to complain. There were not very helpfull but our persistance paid off (after 4 attempts and a private meeting with the manager) we finally got an upgrade to the better rooms located at the far end of the complex. This room was lovely, and it is what you would expect from a 5 star hotel. The bathroom did actually have a door and not a curtain which was a bonus. Lovely gardens mean loads and loads of insects. which we didnt like. After many attempts to get a sun lounger and failing, we went back to the manager and requested to be moved hotel. Again our persistance paid of and we got transfered to the Riu Palace las Amercas. This hotel was ultimate luxury. To sum up. 1) Tequila is great for kids 2) Dirty pool, dirty rooms 3) Impossible to get a sun lounger 4) Too much shade If you are going to the tequila, upgrade to the superior rooms at the back of the complex.

My only complaint would be that there isn't a bathroom at the kids club. There was one on site at the Bambu kid's club. The food at the Bambu was a little better, the rooms at both were nice and the staff at both were great. Having the fridge in the room was very convenient with little ones. We could keep friut in there for the kids to snack on and there was always something available for them to drink. It was very nice having tequila bolted to the wall.

We range from 11 to 38 years-old. Everyone had a great time! Useful things to bring are: underwater camera and watch, biodegradable sunblock (required at Xelha and Xcaret), a water bottle or insulated mug and Ziploc bags (so you can take food from the hotel on your excursions/off-resort outings). We travelled with Sunquest and they charge $5 for your airplane earphones so you may want to bring your own set. The Cancun airport was easy to go through. It took 1 hour to get to the hotel and there were no bathrooms on our bus so children may want to use the airport washrooms. There are ladies with free tourist information just past the baggage checkpoint. There is a departure tax ($25 to 45 US) so check to see if it was included in your fees (it prepaid for us). They also let us weigh our bags as a group which made the weight restrictions much easier! The weather was 27 to 30 Celsius with a slight wind most days and only one red flag day (we went bodysurfing and had a blast!). Checkin was easy and our bags were taken to our rooms immediately. The rooms had 2 double beds and a cot as well as a small table, TV, dressers, safe, mini bar fridge (2 liter water, mineral water, Pepsi, Orange, 7-Up and beer) and bar (rum, vodka, gin, tequila). There was a towel rack on the balconey for drying your towels. The buffet were very nice: lots of variety and something for everyone to eat. The staff were prompt and helpful. We went with the 6:30 sitting but it is very easy to switch to the 8:30 sitting if you are going to be late. There is a Steak House at the Tequila and it was so good that we went twice! The Yukatan has a 'Mediterranean' one which had a variety of fish and seafood. Although it is not on the menu, you can get chicken and fries for the children if you prefer. There were lots of activities to do at the Tequila: stretching/aquabics, bacci, ping-pong, volleyball, darts, tennis, water polo, scuba lessons, shuffleboard, massage/facials, etc. There are 2 large pools to use and there were lots of chairs to choose from. We used the beach at the Yukatan. It takes 7 minutes to walk there *slowly* so that is not an issue. The sand was great and the swim area was wonderful (soft on the feet, clear, large). There are a variety of watersports you can do and all nonmotorized ones are free, as are lifejackets. If you walk to the South, there is open beach and jungle starting 2 hotels away ... truly a beautiful sight. The best exchange rates were at Xelha/Xcaret and the banks (there is one right next to the Tequila and it will exchange money 9 to 11 a.m. and has a bank machine to get pesos from). The exchange was $1 US = 11.5 peso. Everywhere else only gave 10 pesos. This includes all stores, taxis and vendors so it is always cheaper to pay in peso. The vendors will sell you things for 40 to 50% of their original price so remember this for shopping. Playa del Carmen is an easy 30 minute walk or 5 minute taxi from the hotel. The RIU taxis have fixed rates and won't negotiate but taxis at other locations would get into a bidding war for you. The taxi cost $30 US each way to Xelha and $10 US for Xcaret and can hold 4 people. We went to Xelha and Xcaret while here. It is cheaper and easier to take a taxi than to take the excursion. Admission for Xelha is cheaper on Saturday and Sunday ($22 adult) and Xcaret costs $49. Lockers cost $2. You'll want a full day for both. Xelha is open 9 to 6. You can see dolphins, fish, turtles. You can snorkel in a huge area, lounge by the ocean, go through a cave, jump off a rope or cliff, float down the river, etc. It's activities are mainly water-based so not good for the nonswimmers. Lifejackets are free. Xcaret opens from 8:30 to 9. THe evening show is done at 8 and the taxis are gone by 8:30 p.m. You can see monkeys, parrots, native animals, jaguars, a bird hatchery, etc. They have a smaller snorkel/swim area. You can snorkel down an underground river. They have locked bags to put your things in and you pick them up on the other end (you can do the same at Xelha if you go tubing). There is a Mayan village and cemetary. The evening show lasted almost 2 hours with an intermission. The children were bored after the 1st half but the adults loved it! I think there is something for everyone both at the RIU Tequila and Mayan Riviera!

We were married there, and were joined by a party of 26 friends and family for the first week. The bottom line with this resort is that it is excellent value for the money you pay to go. I'll also talk a little about the wedding services available, as I had trouble finding that information when I was reading reviews before travelling. Because we were travelling with a large party, everyone had different experiences. One couple had trouble with the air conditioning and the room not being cleaned early in the day, but no one else had complaints and the maid service we received was excellent. Everyone enjoyed the food, and the steakhouse was awesome (even though you need to make reservations early in the morning). The shower pressure and hairdryers provided are great. The disco was smelly and slimy, but town isn't far away or expensive to get to, so we did most of our \"socializing\" in Playa del Carmen instead (after the evening shows). the pools are very nice, but there are lots of rude people who put towels down (dispite signs that ask you not to do so) and \"save\" beds all day to use them for an hour or so. There were lots of different things for all in the party to do to occupy them, and everyone had a great time. Make sure that all of your travel arrangements are made correctly (that your tickets are correct, etc). Sunquest goofed on 2 of our guests, and the hotel WAS NOT accommodating. Even though it wasn't their mistake, the guests were already in Mexico and at the resort, so the treatment was definately lacking (one girl was travelling alone and arrived the day before I did, didn't know anyone else, and was told she didn't have a room for the night. Inexcusable). THE WEDDING: Bottom line, the wedding was beautiful, and the wedding dinner was wonderful. Overall, I'm happy with how things went. However, some BIG things to consider if you are planning a wedding here (and I've also addressed these concerns with the resort so hopefully its better for you!): - the wedding coordinators are overworked, and there are many weddings booked there. If there are other weddings in the week you are there (there were 9+ our week) then they WILL NOT HAVE TIME to spend with you other than to arrange the basics. The wedding coordinator did not have time to do our rehearsal (after booking an appointment to do so), which understandably caused a LOT of stress! They are fairly prompt with answering e-mails, but expect to make most of the arrangements after you arrive (other than date, time of ceremony, and dinner restaurant). - I'd highly recommend dinner at the steak house. It was perfect. If your wedding package includes the trio, have them play at dinnertime - magical!! If you want to do a rehearsal dinner the night before with family and friends the seafood restaurant (at the Yucatan) is also nice, but you'll have to get up early to reserve the seating. - We had a bit of an issue with photography. We were promised one photographer and had the other one show up at the ceremony. The pictures were still very nice, BUT there was very little honoring of arrangements made at any point in the process. On the up side, it costs about $400 usd to buy the cd of high resolution pictures, and I don't know anywhere else that sells the negatives for that amount!!! - It takes a significant lenght of time to get your offical paperwork back (4 months +), so be prepared for that. If you have any questions specific to the wedding planning process there, please get in touch and I'd be happy to respond! Thanks for reading the review!

At some points, I was hesitant because of some of the negative comments that people had about such things as the food, service, and appearance. I'll just say that from the moment we landed in Cancun from the cold north, people wanted to help us. I know a little Spanish, so I'm sure that helped. We had been to the Cancun area, so we knew what to expect as far as the climate, insects, and uncomfortable beds. We stayed in a 3 star island hotel, and in a 5 star Sheraton (don't go there), and there were still small bugs around and you have to be careful of the water. Not a big deal. Anyway, from the first night to the last, our honeymoon kept getting better. Our room was fully stocked with drinks, water, beer, pop and liquor. And I'm not talking about mini bottles....Liters!! The food service was great, the food was great. We had our own server for dinner the entire week. Nico is the hardest working server that I've ever had. Even though he had about 20 tables, we felt like he was working for us. Everyday we were greeted by the staff with an \"Hola\" or \"Buenos Dias.\" The hotel was just beautiful. The pools were clean, the restaraunts maintained, the bars were clean, there were always people taking care of the grounds and buildings. If there was one thing wrong with the hotel, it's that the beds were uncomfortable and that instead of one king size, there were two full beds next to each other. But the lack of comfort was expected, as had been the case at the other hotels before. I guess I would also add that the bars do water-down all of the cocktails, but with your own bottles in your room, you can make up for that later, even though you can just ask the bartender to add more alcohol if that's your thing. But that was perfect for my wife because she doesn't like to be able to taste her alcohol. Overall, I would recommend this hotel to anyone who is looking for a relaxing, enjoying time in Mexico. It's far enough away from all the hustle of downtown and the city, but close enough to walk or ride in a few minutes. And don't let the negative talk about the beach fool you. It's really a nice 7-10 minute walk, or if you wait 5-10 minutes, the golf cart will pick you up. Other recommendations would be a trip to Chitzen Itza, but pack some water and stretch, it's a lot of walking/climbing. We also went 4-wheeling through the jungle and on a speedboat, just me and the wife. This package was nice too because we got to drive instead of just go along for the ride. All in all, a great vacation and all inclusive is the way to go! We will definitely do it again.

It is a well landscaped resort and has nice pools and facilities. When I say that you get what you pay for, you get a nice beach, not the best I've seen. You get a very average room, but we were never really in it so it didn't matter. You get buffet food, basically just pasta, breads, soups, salsa, and some chicken/steak meals, all the same just mixed up a little each night. It is only a 5-10 minute walk to the beach which is absolutely no big deal, definately takes preferance over waiting for the golf cart only to have rude, overweight Europeans run in front of you and act like they didn't know you were waiting or what you are saying. There was not power in the resort for about 5 hours early one morning, not a big deal but the room was even more musty/smelly since the air conditioning was off. The next day, 1/2 of the hotel had no hot water, still understandable and not a big deal. Had jewelry stolen out of the room and managment told me the maid had been there for 10 years and they have never had complaints on her, but the hotel hasn't even been there for 10 years, so not sure who he thought he was fooling. He did send a bottle of champagne to the room and took care of some room charges so I was satisfied. We WERE planning on having a wedding there sometime in the near future, until we meet Jessica at the Riu Palace. After waiting at her desk for 15 minutes while she stood outside, she made it very clear that she didn't have time for us, so she told us to go to the Riu Yucatan, and they could help us. They had no idea why she sent us there, and told us to go back to her. Needless to say, we didn't. Also, got violently ill from the food on the last day. Worst I have ever been.

We read all the write-ups and hoped the positive feed back was true....it was! The grounds were beautiful and maintained daily. The help was friendly. The food was fabulous. We decided to go to town one evening, just for a change of pace and were sorely disappointed because the food did not compare at all to what we received in the resort. The beach restaurant was amazing for lunch and the buffets in the actual resort were uncomparable. So many choices and not just restricted to Mexican. One of the problems we dealt with was that there were too many options and we over ate. The walk to the beach was a little bit of a jaunt but it was so beautiful walking through the walkway that we didn't mind. A trolley was available but our timing seemed to always be off. We decided that we needed the excercise anyway after all that food. The pool was great except we were surprised at the water temperature. It was a bit chilly but with the hot weather, once we got in it was refreshing. We enjoyed the ability to make our own drinks in the rooms. Each room has a refrigerator stocked with soft drinks and bottled water and 4 kinds of hard liquor available. The restaurants had self serve beer, wine, soft drinks and juices. As we were walking to the beach we got to experience seeing a mom and dad monkey with their two little ones climbing in the trees above us. It was pretty exciting. We walked to town once 2 kilometers but after that we took a cab-$1.00 each way per person. It was so hot we decided to opt for the cab ride. The ocean water was a bit rough. We expected it to be a lot calmer and don't know if it's like that all the time or just this time of year. We took a day excursion to Coba. We highly recommend it. We saw the Coba ruins, a Mayan village, swam in an underground cave and did some repelling off the side of a cliff plus got to go on a zip line. It was a wonderful day and we felt very much worth the money. We paid $75 each and were served an original Mayan lunch. It was about 1 hour away from the resort and a van took us over and back. We would do it again!. All in all, it was one of the best 9 days we have spent. The beach is gorgeous with powdered sand and about 3 or 4 miles to walk. We would consider going back even tho' we hardly ever return to the same place. This was exceptional. We loved our waiter Niko.

After this trip I came to the conclusion that the Tequila was just as nice or better than the others, the only difference being that it was not oceanfront. However I noticed that most of the oceanfront properties rooms, because of their lower height, did not offer oceanview rooms, so I definetely feel it is worth the cost savings to stay at the tequila. With that said, here is my review: *1. Lobby Area: This is very well decorated in neutral colors with murals and wrought iron fixtures. Very relaxing with lots of couches. There is no concierge in the lobby, however, representatives from tour groups such as Apple or Funjet are there to assist with booking excursions. Our check-in was very smooth. If you arrive very early, expect to have to wait until at least 2:00 for your room. Bring a bathing suit/ change of clothes to change in their changing facilities while you wait for your room. **Definite Bonus-There was no time wasting \"orientation\" to go through upon arrival like many other AI's have. Also there were no timeshare reps on the premises. *2. Room: We upgraded to a suite for $70 a night. I was very pleased with the size, there was a sitting area with a couch and chair. We had plenty of water in the minibar, also soda and beer. We left a note and $2 for the maid to give us diet pepsi and she gave us 5 bottles. The liquor dispenser has vodka, rum, scotch, and tequila. Our room was on the 2nd floor and had a view of trees, which was relaxing to watch them swaying in the wind. Our bathroom had a bidet, which is a strange sight for us americans (make sure your kids know its not a water fountain!) The toiletries provided are bath gel and shampoo, which is not very good, so make sure to bring your own shampoo and conditioner. Never had any problem with the AC or anything else. The bed is two double beds pushed together, which means you're either really snuggly with your husband if you sleep in the same bed, or you can sleep really far apart if you get sick of them! *3. Pool and Beach: The lanscaping is awesome, there are trees everywhere, with trails connecting the areas. There are 2 pools, one with a pool bar. The water is a little chilly at first, but not bad. We never had a problem getting a chair, and there are lots of chairs in the shade and set farther back from the pool for more privacy. Unless you have small children, are elderly, or are lazy, there is really no excuse to complain about the walk to the beach. You can walk down the connector road or you can just walk through the Yucutan resort. The water is a very pretty color, the waves a little rough, and yes, there are some topless sunbathers. *4. Food-Very good. Always lots of fresh fruit. Always Pizza, burgers, fries, and hot dogs for the kids. Wine, beer, and soda on tap and readily available. Restaurant atmosphere was very nice. Dinner had dessert fondue selections every night, such as fried bananas with strawbery or chocolate sauce, Yum! Better to have the late seating for dinner because then you can watch the show afterwards if you want. The lunch was served at least till 4:00 *5: Bar, Disco, and shows: The main bar was always pretty fun, the bartenders were very attentive. THe disco always had a good crowd and was fun if you like to party and dance. The shows were better than I expected. The Micheal Jackson was good, and they had a hollywood show that was very comedical and made us laugh a lot. I did Karaoke one night before the show but they only let like 6 people sing because it was only for an hour. The bar area at the tequila was much more lively than the other RIUs. *People Watching and Service: The clientele varied widely in age, which is good. There were about 60% europeans, which made it a bit harder to meet and talk to new people because of the language barrier. Get ready to see some men of all ages and shapes wearing speedos as well!! The service was very good at this hotel, you didn't quite realize how good it was until you left the resort to go to other places and areas. The workers were always pleasant and smiling and saying HOLA as you walked by. Overall it was a very pleasant experience.

I have sent it to the hotel management staff and hope no one ever has to go through this. I only provided last names to protect the innocent. Letter: My wife slipped and fell in the Riu Yucatan restaurant during our family vacation at the Riu Tequila (December 10 \u2013 17 2004). My wife, daughter and I were walking through the Riu Yucatan restaurant to get to the beach when my wife fell. Please note that the only available route from the hotel to the beach runs through the restaurant. Two caution signs, one on the entrance to the restaurant and the other on the exit to the beach, were always up warning guests of wet floors. On the morning of December 13, 2004 my wife, daughter and I were on our way to the beach when we came upon a maintenance crew that was cleaning the floor in between the signs. We walked in between the dining tables on the side to avoid the slick floors when my wife slipped and fell. She suffered a severe blow to the head and was unconscious for several minutes. When she came to she was unable to remember who she was or where she was for about an hour. I took her to a local doctor (Dr. Lopez) who examined her and advised me that she had suffered a concussion and prescribed bed rest to alleviate the pain and headaches she was having. I filed an accident report with hotel general directors Lic. Mallo (Riu Yucatan) and Dir. Ponette (Riu Tequila). I spoke with both of them at great length about what I perceived as a safety violation. I explained to them that I travel to Cancun every year and have seen better methods of cleaning floors that ensure guest safety. I went to the Iberostar Tucan hotel next door and videotaped their maintenance crew cleaning the floors along the path to the beach to prove my point. My video tape clearly shows that their maintenance crew only cleans half of the path at a time and places yellow caution tape around the wet areas. I showed this videotape to the Lic. Mallo and to the Sub director of Riu Tequila Mr. Davo. Lic. Mallo explained that his resort only provides maintenance for the club beach restaurant and the property where my wife fell belongs to Riu Tequila. I spoke with Mr. Ponette from Riu Tequila, who refused to watch my videotape. He told me that the accident report was filed and was sent to the central office. The rest of our vacation was spent caring for my bed ridden wife. We went home and my wife who was still in pain went to our family physician who reexamined her and performed special tests (CAT scan, x-rays). He verified that the concussion that she had suffered was the reason for her constant pain and discomfort. Needless to say I am very disappointed with the way my wife\u2019s accident was handled. The hotel staff made no effort to call for an ambulance, a doctor, apologize, or even check in on her to see how she was after she was confined to bed. I am also disappointed with Mr. Ponette\u2019s refusal to view my videotape. I only wanted to demonstrate that there are other ways for his staff to maintain a clean and safe property. Many of my friends who travel quite frequently to Cancun with their families have expressed their shock and frustration. They have strongly suggested that I post my experience online to alert all future travelers about the treatment that awaits them at these properties. P.S. The shuttle that transports guests from the property to the beach was out of service for 3 days. Call ahead if you don't like to walk. Had to change rooms 3 times because of inadequate air conditioning. This place needs some heavy duty remodeling. No public phones on the property...forced to use pricey hotel phones to make calls out of country. Lastly... make sure you bring your beach towels back to where you got them.

What a beautiful place the Riu Tequila is and the beach which is about a 7 minute walk away is beautiful. Once you are on the beach you can use the Riu Yucatan or the Riu Playacar bar for cocktails and afternoon snacks (brillant). The grounds of the Tequila are lovely, the place is immaculatly kept and the staff are very friendly and work very hard. We had a room on the 2nd floor at the back of the beautiful grounds (room 1815) and the balcony was surrounded by palm trees, very secluded. The room itself was large, very comfortable and airy. The air conditioning very good and not that noisy and 2 double beds are provided (not that we needed 2!). The maid service is first class and if you leave a dollar tip every day you will come back to the room with some beautiful towel designs including swans, dogs and crocodiles. The food at the hotel is amazing! My wife (being addicted to the dessert section of the buffets) put on about 9 pounds over the course of 3 weeks! There is so much to choose from and I can't believe anyone would complain about it. We went to the steakhouse 3 times and we found it excellent. It was nice to do something a bit different than the buffet now and again. We tried all the cocktails on the menu - Blue Ocean and Bannana Mamas (with Bannana liquor in) being our favourites. If we had to fault the hotel (and we are being really picky here!) it would be that there is no self service laundry facilities which would've been nice. It is quite expensive for the hotels own laundry service and you have to add a further 70% on top if you want it ironed but if you were there for just a week or two then maybe you wouldn't need to do any washing. We bought some detergent from the local shop for $1 and washed essentials in the sink. Another picky fault would be that the shows in the evenings by the in-house animacion team were a bit amateur and silly (most of what they do is dance and mime to songs) but we noticed that the kids who were staying in the hotel loved it and after all it is a family resort so for a bit more sophistication we headed downtown to Playa Del Carmen for some live bands and trendy bars such as The Blue Parrot - an absolute must! There are taxis waiting outside the hotel and the cost is only $4 to town. My wife loves shopping but the shops are quite expensive in town. They get a bit cheaper as you go further down fifth avenue so prepare for every shop owner trying to lure you into their shop! As you would imagine, most of the shops sell the same stuff - sombreros, hammocks and other typical Mexican souveniers. Remember the golden rule for shopping in these kind of shops - PREPARE TO HAGGLE! The lowest you can expect to get a really nice sombrero (most of the shops sell the same kind in different colours) is around $18. Cheapest double hammock with wood $30-35. Cheapest hammock no wood $20. As for the excursions make sure you go to Chichen Itza!!! Be prepared for a 3 hour coach journey though! We were told by our guide that as from next year they will not be allowing the public to climb up the huge pyramid here so do it while you have the chance! When we got to the top it is an awesome view but very dangerous as there are no safety restrictions and it is very steep - and a long way down! My wife found it quite scary to climb down but she was glad she did - it is well worth it. The other favorite trip was to Xcaret (pronounced eshcaret). It is only 5-miles from the hotel and such a beautiful place! Whatever you do, make sure you go to the night show which usually starts around 6pm and lasts for 2 hours - its truly spectacular! We also went to Cozumel - worth a trip but not amazing. Also went to Isla Mujeres on a fun boat - when we got there we hired a golf buggy for $25 and buggied around the island - great fun! Xel-ha (pronounced shell-ha) is also well worth a trip especially if you like snorkelling! absolutley stunning! If, like us you go with Thomas Cook or indeed any other British tour operator be warned that their excursion prices will be alot dearer than what you will find in town. The rep will try and tell you not to do the trips with any other company as the guide wont be able to speak english or the bus won't be air conditioned - this is because they want you to spend your money with them so they can get their commission! It is worth shopping around, we saved a lot of money and the companies in town provide top quality tours! We got sucked into going to a couple of timeshares which, if you have the time are worth it as when we went to visit the Mayan Palace Resort, we negotiated $200 cash and 2 free tickets to Tulum and Xel-ha but prepare for a headache from the hard sales speak! Just dont ask too many questions and say no at the end and its worth the 2 hours! To summarise we got everything we wanted from the holiday, first class hotel with beautiful grounds and food, brillant service and a lovely room. The white sands of the beach and the clear blue waters of the sea are fantastic. There is plenty of bars to visit in town and plenty of wonderful excursions to go on ( The Mayan culture and history is very interesting) In one word this honeymoon was SUPERB.", "Date": "December 21, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Telford, England", "Title": "\u201cWhat a fantastic place to spend your honeymoon\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2876910", "Content": "We have just returned from the riu tequila where we spent our honeymoon and what can I say,,, the place is superb.

We are a family of 2 adults, a 2 year old and a 5-month-old baby - we were a little apprehensive of what to expect as we had done all inclusives to Cuba and the Dominican Republic before we had children but this was a first long haul with the 2 children. We travelled with Direct Holidays and would not recommend them at all the list of complaints is too long to go into. Fortunately the hotel made up for it. The Flight Our outbound flight was changed to go via Canada resulting in a 13 hour flight! Our return flight was changed 4 times! We flew out on a Skyservice aircraft, which was a bit shabby compared to the My Travel aircraft we returned on. However this had no reflection on our holiday. The flight with My Travel was fine. We upgraded to the premier gold seats to ensure a little extra space, as our children had no seats. It proved to be valuable. The cabin crew were helpful and friendly. The Airport The queues at the airport were as all the reviews had said - quite long and slow. However we managed to get through fairly quick, we managed to avoid the bag search but there were a lot of people who didn\u2019t. On the return flight every case was opened. I was dreading all our dirty washing flying around but they were very discreet. You pay the departure tax at the check-in desk. It was $46 per adult our infants didn't pay, as they had no seat on the aircraft. There is a Subway before you get through passport control (if you fancy a baguette to take through). On the other side is the usual variety of cafes, duty frees and bars but there is also a Burger King. Hotel Check-in The lobby is very impressive. There is a beautiful fountain in the middle surrounded by ample couches. Half is open air which when we had a bit of a downpour was fun. We arrived at the hotel at midnight, check-in was extremely smooth. Our bags were taken to the room and we were told that they had left a cold meal in the room for us as the restaurants where closed. It was cheese and ham salad with a bread roll. I thought it was a nice touch, although we never ate it. The Room We had a ground floor room facing the path which at first I was disappointed about. But it was set back quite far so I never felt as though we were in a goldfish bowl. Be aware there is no light on the balcony. We like to sit out and have a drink before we go out but it was always pitch black. It was also a haven for our mosquito friends who took that opportunity to feed on us. Our room was quite damp smelling but not enough for it to be an issue. It is a hot humid country and they do everything they can but there are limits. The bathroom was curtained off which was a strange concept when I read it in the brochure but it works well. The plug in the sink in the bathroom doesn't fit. We spoke to other people who said the same. It may not be an issue for anyone not having to clean baby\u2019s bottles! The toilet was in the bathroom but it was a separate room. The optics where in the bathroom as was the fridge. They were stocked up every other day but on one occasion they hadn't left us any beer - my husband phoned reception and within 30 minutes they brought us 9 bottles of Corona. The spirits in the optics were full sized bottles of Tequila, Vodka, Gin and Rum (not the white or the dark rum, the middle one). We found we only really had the beer. There is no bath and there is no light in the shower, but we never found this to be a problem. Maid We tipped $5 on the first day and we got towel swans. The next day we tipped $2 and we got towel dogs AND the room was turned down when we returned at night. From then on in we left a constant $2 but never got anything like that again. Not sure if it was a different maid or he (yes I said he) just thought 'bugger it I can't be -----\" Restaurants Anybody saying they didn't like the food must be very hard to please. The cleanliness and the presentation was faultless. The buffet restaurant has got a vast range of foods. At dinner there was 2 or 3 soups, a salad bar, cold starters, (smoked salmon, mussels, parma ham, salads), a mexican counter (various tacos, burritos etc), the speciality roast (pork, lamb, turkey), the hot grill (fish, steaks, veg), american (pizza, chips, burgers). There was a wide selection of breads. A dessert counter, 5 or 6 ice creams. Oh and much much more that I've probably forgotten. You would be hard pushed not to find anything you fancied. Breakfast was a good selection of cereals, the cheeses and hams the Scandinavians have for breakfast, streaky bacon, all the varieties of eggs you can have, pancakes, and then wacky stuff they always through in that you think \u2018ugh\u2019 who'd have that for breakfast. I think it's fascinating you can guess a persons nationality by what they eat for breakfast. During the day the restaurant by the pool serves a similar selection with maybe not as much variety. Lunch was 12pm-3pm and I can honestly say that I never thought food was dried up if you went later. They were constantly bringing out fresh stuff. There were always enough tables in there and they were kept cleared and clean. They also had a popcorn and a nacho machine were you just helped yourself. At night the pool restaurant turned into the steak restaurant. We ate in there twice and never had a problem getting in. There was a set menu with a choice of 5 main meals. The rib eye steak was nicer than the sirloin. The other restaurant is on the beach. For some reason it always got booked up quickly. We managed to get in one night. It\u2019s a fish restaurant, again a set menu with a choice of 5 main meals. I like seafood so I enjoyed it but I spoke to some people who said it wasn\u2019t their thing. We also ate in the Hotel Playacars restaurant one afternoon. I\u2019m glad we never stayed there. Like most people say, the Tequila is the nicest. Beach/Pool We never went on the beach. We walked down with the aim of it (buying the bucket and spade set from the shop for $14, but when we got there it was so busy with hardly any shade and the prospect of trying to get the pram across the sand wasn\u2019t so attractive. So we gave it a miss. But just to say, anyone complaining about how far the beach is, is probably fat and lazy. It\u2019s about a 7 minute stroll down a peaceful, well shaded path. There is the buggy/train that goes to the beach isn't ideal if you've got prams. There's not much space. We tended to stay by the pool. There were plenty of sun beds both in the shade and in the sun. I have to admit though (I\u2019m embarrassed to say) we did the German thing and got up at 7am and put the towels on the bed!! It was mainly because of having 2 children, and 2 buggies and needing shade near the shallow pool. But we weren\u2019t the only ones and we were never the first. The pool was nice. It was big and never got crowded but we tended to stay away from the swim up bar. There was a few more leaves and floating insects for my liking but they did always appear to be cleaning it so maybe it\u2019s just one of those things. Entertainment The Animacion team work so hard. They are very friendly and well motivated. We didn\u2019t enter into much but they still came and chatted to us. They asked if you wanted to join in but never pushed it if you said no. The shows are mainly them miming and dancing to various songs with each evening having a theme. It was typical Caribbean/all inclusive hotel entertainment. Some was a bit boring some was spectacular. During the day there appeared to be plenty to do if you wanted it. Even the day it rained all day there was entertainment brought inside, dance lessons, casino, darts etc. The nightlife seemed to end about 11. There was the disco for over 18s (which we couldn't go in). It was the type of place that went to bed early and got going early. I think it was because it got dark about 5pm. It's not the place if you are looking for an exciting nightlife. Excursions We never ventured far. We went into Playa Del Carmen for the day and just strolled round. We had lunch at Senior Frogs and it was the best meal we had the whole holiday. It was a great place with a great atmosphere. Sounds like it was better doing it direct than going on the trip. We also took the ferry to Cozumel. The ferry was more fun than the place. We took the yellow ferry, which is $2 more but a lot less crowded and we never had to queue.

This had been my first time on any all-inclusive vacation, and now, unfortunately, I'm all too aware of what I have been missing. I'd go back in a heartbeat. No problems at the resort at all. The pools were phenomenal and my five-year-old will be talking about the swim-up bar for years, I fancy. I found the staff to be friendly and animated at all times, and I was never bored for one second. I did go on one outing--took a trip on the FAT CAT, and it was well worth the money spent. In fact, we even got to see wild dolphins right in front of the net off the bow, and one of the crew members told us that in the nine months he'd been on the boat, it was only the third time he'd seen dolphins and the first time up close. Note--bring some American dollars and tip your maids. My son was very enthused about the collection of towel origami that mounted in our rooms as the week went on! The only fly in the ointment had nothing to do with the resort and everything to do with SkyService. Think twice before flying SkyService, people. There was a five-hour delay on our flight home, and Sunquest never bothered to call our hotel to tell us about it although they were well aware of it and had, in fact, called all the hotels in Cancun about it. There have apparently been quite a few problems recently with SkyService. Being crammed into seats made for people under 5 foot 7 for five hours or so didn't improve our tempers. (I'm 5 foot 10 and my husband is 6 foot 2, so we were in agony by the end of the first half hour.) The RIU Tequila itself was outstanding. The activities for children were well-supervised by a lady who was better with children than my son's kindergarten teacher. Carolina was always aware of every child under her care, and there were often upwards of twenty of them clustered around her. It's an ideal place for small children. Oh, and the drinks--if you're there to get drunk, stick to the beer or the liquor in your room's bar. I spent most of the week anywhere from tiddly to completely blotto, and somehow never managed to get a hangover; I was awake every morning fresh as a daisy at 6 a.m., ready to start again. It must be something about the tropical air! I never had any success getting that \"happy glow\" when I ordered drinks from the bartenders until I switched to beer, which has a constant alcoholic content. I'd definitely go back again!

We had read all the reviews and got there there with an open mind. All the staff at the hotel were amazing and could not do enough to make our stay more enjoyable. The food was top class with a choice of 3 restaurants, cleanliness and food displays were 2nd to none. The room maids are so clever with all the animals they make out of towels. The barstaff have got to be the fastest in the empire with sometimes as many as 3 customers at a time being served. yet they never get an order wrong. We decided to go on Sea Life Discovery Plus at a cost of 179 USA Dollars per person which is expensive but money well spent. We first fed and got in the water with Stingrays, then on to the Manatees, we also fed and entered the water with them, they are so layed back, we also had free time swimming with them. Then it was time for the dolphins. You go in no more than teams of 6 people at a time, learning all about them then stroking and doing tricks with them. If you only want to swim with the dolphins and not the stingrays and manatees the price is 125 USA Dollars. The DVD for the Sea Life Discovery Plus is 59 USA Dollars The DVD for the Dolphin Discovery is 49 USA Dollars. Believe me you will want to buy one afterwards, it was brill, and the DVD is also of a very good quality. We were going to go to Chichen Itza but were put off by the long 3 1/2 hour coach journey there and only 1 1/2 hours ther then back on the coach. We caught the ferry to Cozumel which is a 20 minute crossing from Playa Del Carmen, only 4 USA Dollars taxi from the hotel. Make sure you ask the price first, we were charged 6 USA Dollars the first time. To be honest there is not much to do in Cozumel but all the big Caribbean Cruise Liners were in port. We went on Airtours Town Tour Party in Senor Frogs in Playa Del Carmen, what a rip off. It costs 29 USA Dollars for free beer and a great good knees up for three hours of mayhem. We got there at 9. 40pm and were told to come out at 11. 50 this was after having to pay 5 or 10 Dollars for raffle tickets, drinks of shorts you have to pay extra, then they are after you spending money on flowers, tee shirts etc, etc. The reps don't come anywhere near you through the night. Mexico airport is a nightmare, they open every individual case in front of you while you wait. You also have to pay departure tax of 500 Mexican Pesos or 46 USA Dollars. On our flight there were loads of people that were stunned by excess baggage, they had to pay the taxes. Some people in our party who got married while over in Mexico had to pay over \u00a380. So be warned and watch your weight. We would certainly not hesitate to recommend the Tequila to anybody who wants a great holiday with all you could wish for and more.

We had a very private balcony not facing anyone else. The liquor dispensers and the refrigerator constantly stocked with beverages is a plus. The food is delicious. The little disco was quaint. The pool is very attractive with a swim up bar. Riu's are nice because staying at one gives you privileges at the others. In this case we ate and played at the Riu Yucatan and Riu Playacar, both a five minute or so walk. The walk is pleasant. Both of those Riu's are directly on the beach. Riu Yucatan has a nicer beach and is more attractive. I did have fun taking the water aerobics at the Playacar pool however. The weather was perfect too. There are waves at this beach and don't expect to see fish right there. If you want to be with obnoxious Americans go to Cancun. If you prefer the serenity of classy Europeans go to Playa del Carmen. The town itself is lovely. Quaint bars,unique shops and safe. We also visited Cozumel, worth a day's trip but not more. I have children and thankfully for me they were not there this time, because it was Mommy's turn to have fun, (although have been to Puerto Aventuras city with them- also highly recommended), so I noticed that there were activities for the kids and a nice playground for them too.

While we have also stayed at the highest end resort, I was pleasantly surprised by the high quality of the RIU tequila; was worried as we got such a phenomenal deal on Funjet out of Chicago - that for the cost it could not be too great (I was wrong). The food was very good and plentiful and the staff was great. The bar men by the pool took great care of us. The gardens were lovely and the room was fine (very clean) not luxury but again, not expected. The walk to the beach is very short - the buggy actually took longer - but we are not really beach people so we enjoyed the pool more. The water was a bit chilly but not as cold as others we've been to. The only negative points are that you must eat the same time every night (choose a seating). We found that at the early seating (6:30pm) we were hungry later on after the show and there was nothing available for snacking until the next morning so we changed to the later time. The steak ala carte was ok; we loved the atmosphere much more than the buffet dinner but missed the selections of seafood the buffet offered. The drinks were great and this resort served more than I've seen - they encouraged everyone to have as many as you desire. Overall, this resort is of such great value, we decided we would return (save the extra money from the posh resort) to use for the tours - highly recommend XEL HA, was the best snorkeling we have done in our lives. This resort is also much more casual than others; for instance, virtually no dress code even at dinner. We dressed up anyway because we like to but others can be just as comfortable wearing shorts every night. The shows were very entertaining; especially Grease & Monster. We went off property one night to celebrate our anniversary at the most awesome restaurant ever - ALUX.

The animation team are Top people Elvis (I love my job) Tomas and the rest put on top shows without repeating any for 14 days. Trips taken this time were swimming with dolphins at Dolphin Discovery 5 Star, Xel-Ha 5 Star have a look for the Grouper fish in there its huge at least 4-5ft long, Although I give this a 5 Stars if you cannot swim its not for you. Personal Taxi for the day to Cancun taking you anywhere you want and waiting all day we were there from 9.30am til 4.30pm and the whole trip for the 4 of us was $80.00 really good value and no hassle. Jungle crossing was great 5 Star with Trino and Victor good guides and the cave swim was awesome. Some people have complained about the short walk to the beach but as stated before it must take all of 10 mins SLOWLY but there is a golf cart for the less energetic people believe me (ITS NO BIG DEAL). We really do think that out of the 4 Riu Hotels here with the exception of the Palace this is the best one for the all round holiday. We tipped quite often as our waiter told us he was on onle $4.00 a day (Disgraceful) for the work they do. Just a little reply to the previous write up when you are on holiday how do you keep a track on a week day to a weekend day they were no different and neither was the food with a great selection all the time. Also the Taxi,s are not a rip off as explained earlier and the taxi into Playa del carmen was $4.00-$5.00 (\u00a32.30-\u00a32.90)you pay that in the UK just to get into the thing!. Oswald (Director of the Hotel) was without doubt a credit to the Riu chain as he was always on hand if you had a problem with Antonio on the main desk, Raul the bellboy always couteous and friendly and a Hola anytime of the day.We look forward to our 3rd visit in 40 weeks time.

We were eating Mexican food everyday, all day but they had other food like Italian, American etc. We did go to the Steak House one evening which was OK. We did prefer the buffet honestly.

The pool is much bigger at the tequila and the food selection is much better as well. This is a great place to take the family, there was a ton of kids. A word of caution if you are leaving out of Toronto like us, with Sunquest. The tequila is overbooked and sunquest is offering it to you still so that they can fill up all the other riu hotels. We were dropped off at the playacar the first night and were disappointed especially after we toured the grounds of the tequila. BE ADAMENT about what you paid for if you are not happy about the shuffling. They are doing this to everyone. My husband simply stood his ground and talk to the director of the tequila (oswald)and the next morning we were enjoying the tequila. Talk to Oswald immediately because nobody else at the reception will do anything for you. On the plus side, if you don't mind cancun they are offering there best hotel Riu palace las Americas for no extra charge.

The beach was wonderful, with all the palm trees you could choose sun or shade whenever you liked, and the water was beautiful.

It's a short walk to the nearby shopping center, and only a 40-peso cab ride to the main shopping area in Playa. Now, to address some of the concerns others have raised: * We had no problems with Internet access, other than that the room was not well air-conditioned. The computers worked fine. * As some have said, there are no clocks in the rooms and irons are hard (if not impossible) to come by. Neither was an issue for us. I went to dinner pretty wrinkled one night, but who cares? * It is so hot and humid this time of year that the in-room air conditioning can't completely dry the air. It left me feeling cool, but clammy at night. This could be the cause for the mustiness or mold some people mentioned, although we noticed neither. * We didn't find the walk to the beach to be a problem, since it is a shaded, covered pathway, and we could look for wombats (or whatever they are) on the other side of the fence as we walked. It would be nice to have a second shuttle, though. * The pool chair situation is a problem, because people spread towels on the chairs in the morning to save them, then leave. There are signs up to discourage this, but the hotel should be more active in keeping the chairs free.

Certainly not 5 star dining, but much better than all inclusives we have stayed at in Cabo San Lucas, Manzanillo, and Puerto Vallarta. I suppose it depends on what type of food you like. We loved all the fish and the seafood dishes that were served. The selection of fruits and vegetables were great. The deserts were kind of strange for our tastes, but we have found that to be true throughout Mexico. Breakfast was probably the least interesting meal of the day. There's just so many things you can cook for breakfast. There was a wide selection of dishes available at lunch and dinner. Many of the dishes were obviously geared toward the high number of European guests. The selection of breads was incredible. So many great loaves of pumpernickle and rye and french bread. We were just in heaven! We were perfectly happy with the wide selection of food at the buffets so we never tried either of the reservation dinners, so I can't give an opinion there.

Our maid left delighful towel animals on the bed each day. Someone below commented on the lack of face clothes. That is quite common in hotels outside the US. If you normally use one, bring some from home just in case. I always do when traveling outside the country. And for not having a clock in the room??? You're on vacation for heavens sake! Why do you need a clock? And a coffee pot???? Like I said, some people have different expectations. Having the mini bar in our room restocked every other day was great. We never ran out of drinks. We left a note and a tip asking for more water and beer and got it every time. The service at the bars was great, as were the drinks they served. The staff at the hotel was quite friendly. Always had a smile and a Hola when we greeted them. The hotel is rather spread out, but the exercize we got walking was greatly needed after eating so much at the buffets. The short walk or golf cart ride to the beach was not a problem at all. Again, we enjoyed the exercize of the walk. We had no problems finding lounges at the beach at all, no matter what time of day. At the pool, the lounges that got the morning sun did tend to fill up quickly in the morning, but there were always chairs in the shade available that got sun later in the afternoon. The left side of the pool gets the morning sun, the right side the afternoon sun. The pool basically gets sun all day. The animation team at the pool were great. They were very friendly and didn't do the \"in your face hard sell\" to try to get you involved in the activities that some hotel animation teams do. We had a lovely time visiting with animation members Verena and Nadine at the pool and at lunch, two utterly delightful young ladies from Austria and Germany respectively. We never did take in the evening entertainment shows, so I can't comment on them. Most of the hotel guests were European (especially British) and Canadian. Probably no more than 20% Americans, which we thought was great. We had a great time meeting interesting people from all over. So many times we've stayed at hotels in foreign countries where there were so many Americans, it seemed like we were still in America. This was quite a nice change. Again, we had a great time. I imagine people who don't have a great time here either have very different expectations than we have, or had some specific problem that spoiled their view of things.", "Date": "June 6, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "chambersburg, pa", "Title": "\u201cworst trip ever\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2151279", "Content": "we just returned from the riu tequila june 3, 2004. this resort is NOT a 5 star by ant means! the rooms are ok at best. the beds are hard and have plastic under the sheets, not comfortable at all. the pillows, if you could call them that, were flat and worn out. the shower is gross. it is small and doesnt drain well. there are NO clocks in the room so we had no way of knowing what time it was except to pull out my wrist watch. they say they have irons you can use, what they fail to tell you is they only have 10 for almost 700 rooms?? the pool was dirty and VERY over crowded. if you didnt have a chair \"saved\" by 7:30am forget about getting anything near the sun. the food was the worst i ever had in ALL my travels! and most of it is all buffets....yuck. if you stay here get ready to walk,walk,walk,walk! they resort is large and spead out although i dont feel they have enough features at this resort to keep 700 rooms of people occupied. we were bored most of the time. all in all,,,,trust me on this one, stay somewhere else and get your moneys worth. this place isnt worth your time or hard earned cash.", "Date": "June 3, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Newport Gwent S Wales UK", "Title": "\u201cwe didnt want to come home absolutely loved this holiday.\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2124030", "Content": "Just got back from the riu tequila had a great time none of us wanted to come home.

The staff was wonderful and that goes from the front desk staff to the maids. The room was large and very clean, the maid made wonderful towel art every day for us and cleaned everything top to bottom, she even organized all my bathroom stuff!! The wait staff in the restaurant is great, gave our drink order the first night and every night after that our drinks were at the table either before we sat down or immediately after. Now not to many places give you that kind of service, do they??? The food is very good and there is always alot of variety. We tried the steak house and we thought that it was a very good meal. We walked over to the beach at the playacar and we loved it, we always had chairs right up at the waters edge. We did use advice from this site and brought our own thermal mugs and that was a great tip, we were the envy of many.. the pool at tequila was also great, good sized and never really found it overcrowed, always found a pool chair. We also went to xel ha and we did the all day at xel ha. in my opinion that is a must and I felt I could have visited xel ha two days in a row and not been bored.. this is a great day trip. We also did the atv tour and also found that to be a great trip, we had a blast. Took the ferry over to cozumel and rented the mopeds and drove around the island, stopped and had lunch on the eastern shore and that was wonderful too.we did find that cozumel was a very dirty place compared to playa del carmen. So I guess what I am saying is this is one great vacation, I don't see how anyone could have a bad time at this hotel! The staff is wonderful, we felt very safe at all times. LOVED the Place.

The Tequila, Playacar and Yucatan were overbooked. By the time we arrived, we had been up close to 12 hours and my little guy was getting tired. They offered to bus us back to Cancun to the Riu Palace Cancun. We said that we did not want to move and they found us a room very quickly. Why is this happening. It happened to a number of guests. Some took advantage of the Palace, some did not. All in all I spoke with 16 separate people who had this problem. One theory was that the Cancun Palace is at half occupancy and they are trying to fill it up and let people see how nice it is. Those who went said it was very nice, but a totally different type of hotel, no trees little pool and the beach is not great right there. Also, not a place for kids - they try to get you to go to the Riu Cancun next door for the day if you have kids. Just wondering if anyone else ran into this. As far as the holiday went, because we were travelling with a just 4 year old with a heart condition, we did extensive research for our first airline trip with the little guy and decided on the Riu Tequila. We had a fantastic time. After reading reviews here, we brought along a glade plug in, and extra towels and were prepared for the hard bed and tiny pillows. The room was initially musty, but that is because of the climate, not the hotel. The beds were fine, we slept like logs and had a wonderful time. The staff were great and my little guy made lots of friends of the staff. He now has about 10 phrases in another language, Spanish which he used all the time. The walk to the beach was fine. We took the shuttle if it was there, but walked if not. I saw a numer of complaints about the length of time to walk to the beach. All I can say is if a 4 year old with health problems can walk it no problem, then I don't think it was really far. Food was great, always lots of variety. Waiters were very helpful and friendly.

We had a direct flight from Ottawa to Cancun. Arrived at the airport in Cancun at 9:20 am and were at the hotel by 11:30 am. Checked in and had access to our room right away. Our room was located on the 2nd level, a 5 minute walk from the lobby, and did not have a musty smell (although I had brought plug-ins and candles). Our room was average but very clean and certainly nothing to complain about. The ceiling fan was very much appreciated since the air conditioning was not very powerful. We had to call on a few occasions to have bottled water and soft drinks delivered in our room and that was done almost immediately. It was approximately a 13 minute walk from our room to the beach - but that did not bother us. If the shuttle bus was there, we took it, otherwise, the walk was a pleasant one. The beach... beautiful. The water is turquoise and the sand is thin and soft. Sometimes the smell of gasoline bothered me and I think they should only have non-motorized activities at the beach. It was crowded - lots of Europeans on holidays in April. I would say that 30% of the women do go topless at the beach. We never had a problem finding chairs at the beach no matter what time of the day we went. The first day we arrived, my husband was so exited that he tried all the different drinks that the resort offered. Some of us do tend to exaggerate when it\u2019s an all inclusive. What we don\u2019t realize is that when we fly, we get dehydrated and when it\u2019s hot and we drink alcohol, we get dehydrated even more. Well... he did get sick after two days. I gave him some imodium extra strengthbut the diarrhea did not stop and he was feeling worse and could not eat. I did go to the pharmacy and bought some medication that was recommended for infection but that did not help. So finally, my husband agreed to call a doctor. I called our insurance in Canada first so they opened a file (they had advised us to that in order to be reimbursed). We went to the reception and they immediately called the doctor who arrived in our room within 10 minutes. The doctor asked a few questions, touched my husband\u2019s stomach (my husband yelled in pain) and urged him to get to his hospital (Clinica) in Playa del Carmen. The doctor waited for us while we changed and he told us to bring our credit card. He took us the his private clinic and my husband was urgently injected with antibiotic through intravenous. While he was in the emergency room, they asked me to fill out the papers and give a down payment of $1,400.00 USD telling me it could be more or less. The doctor told me that my husband might need a surgery depending on the results of the x-rays because he had waited too long before calling a doctor. But, thank God, he did not need surgery but he did end up spending 2 days at the clinic under surveillance. I want to thank Dr. Martin Hernandez and his nurse Diego for everything they\u2019ve done. Just a word of advice.... go slow on the drinks and food the first few days and if you get sick, don\u2019t wait too long before calling a doctor. And make sure you have insurance. The food was excellent. We did try the seafood and the steakhouse once but we preferred the buffet. I never ate the same dinner twice during my two weeks there. Every night I would get an entree (they had different entrees every night) with a glass of red wine, then I would take the special of the day and I would finish with grapes and cheese as my desert. If you take a little of everything every night then it gets repetitive and you feel like you\u2019re eating the same thing every night. But there is so many food to choose from - so if you don\u2019t like the special of the day, you have the choice from a variety of food. Breakfast was great.... they had everything. That\u2019s when I would eat my sweets... loved that banana bread ! Lunch, we usually ate at the RIU Yucatan since we were at the beach. Again we had the choice from a variety of food. I cannot comment on the pool, since we spent our days at the beach. But the pool at the RIU Tequila is much bigger then at the other two RIUs. In my opinion, I would even say that the grounds, the lobby and the buffet restaurant are nicer at the RIU Tequila. I cannot really comment on the night shows at the resort as we were in bed before it started (10:00 pm). We did, however, got to see the Michael Jackson show and we thought it was very good. We spent a day at Xcaret. Xcaret was wonderful and we got to swim with the dolphins. I had booked through internet and took the full package including the dinner taking a taxi from the hotel for only $10.00 US. The night show was absolutely incredible (from 6:00 pm to 7:30 pm). The dinner is served while you watch the show. Coming back we had to wait in line to get a taxi. But it was worth it. I strongly recommend the RIU Tequila, even if it is not directly on the beach.

Finally, it's true that you must reserve pool loungers early in the morning or your left waiting for someone to leave. The stretch of beach occupied by the 4 RIU properties is beautiful but very crowded. My suggestion to you is to spend a few extra dollars for a resort that doesn't have 3 or 4 adjoining properties...stay at one play at all only means you have to compete at all of them for the same amenities i.e. food, pool/beach space.

You had to be in lines for everything from beach towels to a dinner table assignement. The grounds are beautiful and clean. The beach itself was nice, with fine sand and gorgeous, warm water. It was very cowded though. The beach chairs were not a possibility in the AM, so we stayed in the pool in the morning, and then went to the beach at 3-4pm, and it was quieter and more peaceful. There was a smell from motorized sports, heavy at times. The room was fine, on the 2nd floor at least, was no smell, and beds and pillows were not a problem for us. The towel animals come only with tips. If you do not tip, your room still stays clean. I thought food was excellent, the variety is amazing and they manage to serve it all fresh.

The sand at the beach is very soft and pleasant, and the water is warm and clear. There is volleyball at the beach, and if you pay you can use motorsports. I did parasailing and that was extremely fun. That was a great experience for me. The only problem was the boat and the 45 minute wait.The boat rocks you back and forth and everyone on it was getting seasick. To add to that you have to wait for around 45 minutes. The actual parasailing part is around 15 minutes long, but it is definitely worth the wait. The food is very good at Riu Tequila. For breakfast I highly recommend the donuts which you can dip in sugar. Lunch is nothing special but the beef and steak is made perfect. The deserts for dinner and lunch are the same so don't expect any new deserts for dinner. Dinner is what I waited for all day. My favorite food was the quesadillas. They also have stir fry and many other things. If you want stir fry be prepared to wait a couple of minutes in line. After a while the food gets really boring and it begins to always taste the same. At 7:00 AM you can wake up and reserve a place at either the Mediterraneo (seafood resteraunt) or a steak resteraunt. I only went to the seafood one but it wasn't that great.

I went to the beach in the evening because the pools were crowded at that time while the beach wasn't. To get a shady spot at the pool you must place something on the chair or else it will be taken. The rooms at the resort are nice. Although they are a bit musty, they are OK. The beds are hard but not that hard to complain about them. The rooms have a minibar too in which there is PLENTY of Corona beer and alcohol, and there are also bottles of water and soft drinks. The days can become repetitive, but Riu Tequila is a nice place. I used Vacation Express to travel to Riu Tequila. Do not use Vacation Express. It is a very unorganized company. Its representative is almost never there at Tequila.

The staff at this hotel were exceptionally friendly with the exception of the front desk staff who were pleasant at times but rushed and quick at other times. The food was average but there is a huge selection so you can always find something you like. Our room was very clean and didn't smell \"musty\" like some of the other reviewers said. Out of the 30 or so of us there, only one couple experienced this smell and they were immediately moved to another room. There were plenty of drinks to choose from and our room bar was stocked almost every day. The grounds are absolutely beautiful and there are plenty of day tours to choose from in the lobby. We took an afternoon snorkeling tour and also a morning trip to Tulum to see the ruins. My only complaint would be the lack of security. I would have felt more comfortable if there was gated security at the entrance like there were on so many of the other resorts. We had an incredible time here and would return to Mexico in a heart beat. The people here work extremely hard for very little money (I was told they make about 7 bucks a day).

It's an all inclusive resort but what else are you going to spend your money on and the staff are so appreciative. Towards the end of the trip I even tipped the guy that collects the plastic cups around the pool. He was always so happy doing his job. Also, Playa del Carmen is only a 20-25 minute walk down the road. On the way to Playa there are some small archaelogical sites to explore and an aviary. We walked back to the resort along the beach but I recommend getting past the first 4-6 resorts/condos that front right on the water when you leave Playa.

It's laid back but there's still plenty to do (too much to fit in a week) & you can still \"party\" but not with all the crazy 19 year olds. The night life is not \"party central\" but they have nightly entertainment (I loved the performance of Grease) & you can go off the resort & do other things. They have a bar tour 3 nights a week which is pretty good if your interested in that. The rooms are very clean & nice, they are however a bit musty so bring those Glade-Plug ins. ( I know you've heard it before but they really work--you'll need them) We left a $2 US tip everyday & we loved coming back to our room at the end of our day to see which towel animal was left for us.

I was hesitant at first to stay at the Tequila because it wasn't right on the beach but I actually liked it better & the beach is right across the street.

Just wish he could've told me sooner, but I'll keep it in mind for next time. The food was plentiful and really good. I usually hit the Mexican part of the buffet as I really like to get spicy food, and I was never bored. Lots of salads, side dishes, desserts, too. Don't be afraid to eat anything here, it's all washed in purified water, and the dairy won't do bad things to your digestion, either! The wine at dinner wasn't very good, but it's the same at all the resorts. Maybe the Palace has better quality, but I don't come to Mexico for the wine :) The beach is beautiful, the water an incomparable turquoise. Lots of excursions, from snorkeling on reef and in cenotes, to Mayan ruins. Going to town is easy, just a 15 minute walk. Along the way, visit some of the ruins on the right side of the street, there's one way back along a path, overlooking the beach. It's not much, but the view of the beach is awesome. I'm not a pool person, so I won't comment on that. I would highly recommend this resort. It's not expensive, and it's across the street from the beach, but unless you have a mobility problem, you won't notice it.

One loved the actitivies, one the beach(a short five minute walk) and other one just loved laying around the pool.

The staff was so nice and such hard workers. They were there from early morning till night almost every day and were always so friendly. I don't know how they do it. I hope the Riu pays them well as they all are extremely hard workers. Helpful hint: they use room keys still and I was glad that I had packed large safety pins and it was so handy to pin the keys right on our swim suits or clothes.

We had a flight with Champion Air #125 at 3:45 p.m. . My wife and I and our 2 children, 12 and 9 were at the airport in plenty of time with no hassles checking in. 3:45 p.m. went by and still no plane. 4:45 the plane shows up but we all were not allowed to board the plane. Another 45 minutes goes by and we all notice our plane starts to back away from the loading gate with our luggage loaded. What could be the problem? We later find out that it was a technical error with temperature control.....whatever! 6:10 p.m. we all finally board the plane..6:40 we are Cancun bound 3 hours late. At Cancun, we are all unloaded off the plane onto a bus to bring us to the terminal for immigration. As we all make it up the first ramp in which you climb gradually, I could of just collapsed right there. There must of been at least 5000 people lined up in all directions waiting in line for customs. You had to see it to believe it. I have never seen this before at any airport. Crowds yes, but lines like this, no way. What else could go wrong. Others who have travelled to Mexico before said this has never happened to them the in all the years they have travelled there. It took us 2 hours and 45 minutes just to clear customs. At the luggage carousel Our bags were siting off to the side all in a row, which was very odd. Now we have our 45 minute van ride to the Tequila Riu. After spending 12 hours between 2 airports and me having still being awake for 38 hours, we were were all very hungry and thirsty. When we arrive at the Tequila Riu they had especially opened the buffet for the 4 or 5 families that arrived late. Talk about hospitality. These people went the extra mile and prepared several dishes for us to eat at such a late hour. The food was to die for at this resort(s) Everything at the Tequila, Playacar, and Yucatan was excellent. The tequila was by far the nicest out of them all. I even thought it was better than the Palace Riu even though it was not included. We all just turned our bracelets inside out just so we could see what we were all missing. It was a very elegant place but very snobish. Typical I guess. The grounds there were beautiful and elegant. The night life is lacking at the Riu's. The bars were closing up at 12:00 a.m. most night with the Disco bar staying open. There were to many underaged kids in here with out dated music. I couldn't believe in the amount of under aged kids with the adult bracelets they were all wearing on their wrists. These bracelets are given to you to identify you with your all- inclusive packages. Beige-adult.....Red- kids. White was worn at the Palace for adults. The nightly shows were O.K. Drinks were good, some were week. We paid the guys a couple of dollars to stock our bar fridges everyday rather than every second day. So we always had a nice stock of Coronas, Pepsi, Seven-up and water.We even had them change our Rum, Vodka and Rye to the better stuff..Smirnoffs, Canadian Club and Bacardi's. These people left nothing undone. Romms were clean. The smell was nothing to whine about. You don't notice it after the first day. We brought an air freshener anyways. You could not ask for better accomodations than this place. Chairs were never a problem at the beach or the pool. At the beach, we had to drag a chair 20 feet for a spot. Beaches were clean. If you buy any silver at the beach, make sure it is stamped with 925 and MEX or Mexico together. One of our friends told me this is government related. Just beware! The beach is a 4 to 6 minute walk along a beautiful vined enclosed path. If you cut over to the Yucatan, you can catch the Monkeys up in the tree's. Remember, you are in the jungle there. I couldn't beleive it until I saw it for myself.I must say I could go on forever about this place. It is rated a 5 Star hotel in Mexico. Families or couples, its perfect! Go to Shel Ha for snorkeling, cliff jumping, rope swinging, eating, swimming etc. Do the all- inclusive if you go and start in the morning no later than 9 a.m. . Now the trip home. Once we arrived at the airport, we went through customs with no problems. After about 2 hours we were called to our gate to load on to the waiting bus to shuttle us to flight 126 Champion Air waiting on the tarmac. After we all unloaded in front of the plane we all stood there for about 35 minutes. Now what?! Than all of a sudden a flight personel yells to the crowd for a cell phone with A T &T. This was just unreal. The guy next to me says all we need is for it to rain. It wasn't 20 seconds and it just starts to pour down with rain. Everyone was yelling and cursing. We find out that a flight attendant had exceeded his/her flight hours and could not continue. This was totally unorganized. Who know what the real excuse was. After about an hour and 15 minutes, we all were in the air heading into a storm with lots of lightning. At about 10,000 feet and still climbing we hit severe turbulance and lightning. The plane was dropping and shaking like crazy, I never thought we were going to make it. Well, we did, until we got over Detroit. There were some huge wind gusts from 25 to 40 miles per hour. On our approach to the runway the plane started to twist and turn, shake like rattle. It was by far the most terrifying plane ride I or my family has ever taken.

We stayed from March 6 - 13 / 04. We flew in on Skyservice and of course the flight was awful due to the lack of space one is provided! Customs at the airport went smoothly and we were in and out within 45 minutes. However we had to wait for an hour on the bus for the skragglers to make their way over to the busso we could leave and start our vacation(smoking etc.) Although we had a good time this year I think we may stick to the Occidental chain from now on. We went to the Occidental Grand Flamenco Xcaret last year and this resort does not stack up to the Occidental. Once at the hotel we did not get a room immediatly as check in is not untill 3 pm - so we had to leave our luggage in the lobby and walked around to familiarize ourselves with the resort. The grounds are really nice and well manicured, greenery everywhere and there is always someone around tidying up and making sure things looked presentalbe. They are constatntly sweeping the walkways to remove the leaves that have fallen from the trees! Once in our rooms we were impressed. The rooms are a gross green color but who cares! We had a king size bed (2 beds pushed together) and the bathroom area is really nice! It is seperate from the bed aread and has a cute curtain you can close for more privacy! The shower had good pressure and was always warm. The toilet is in it's own little room that does stink! We had water all over the floor from our leaking toitlet and had to call to have it fixed twice. Both times the guy just re-caulked it and it worked for a few hours and then started leaking again. We eventually just stopped calling and cleaned up the water ourselves. There is a huge closet with the safe inside, beer fridge has Corona, Pepsi , 7-up, Orange drink, and water (lots). There is also 4 - 26's in your room: Tequila, Rye, Vodka and Gin. Our tour book said Rum but there was none in the room. We asked to have our Rye swithcked to Rum and they said NO. This is all free and although they say they only stock the fridge every other day - just ask the they will do it for you sooner. Our maid did an excellent job and our room was always done by noon. She made us towel animals everyday and left little roses and such made out of toilet paper! We did tip our maid as well as leave her gifts (soaps, perfume, toiletries etc). Balcony was big and had 2 chairs and a little table to relax and have a drink before supper! TV - there is only 4 English channels and those 4 have spanish subtitles. The pool is nice, could be bigger. People are right when they say the water is cold; but after laying in the hot sun it's nice to jump into a cold pool. There is 2 sides to the pool - the one with the swim up bar is of course the most popular. The staff at the swim up bar are awesome. They don't skimp on the booze and they are really fast at getting you served. The lounge chairs are taken by about 7:30 so get up and get out there or you'll be out of luck. Beach is a walk away, it is a little bit of a distance but it's a nice walk and if you are lazy they have a golf cart that runs every 15 minutes to take you there.It is usually hard to find a beach chair here as well so you have to go early, but we just threw our stuff in the sand and went swimming. The water is beautiful and warm. If you take a piece of bread in with you and break off little chunks...tropical fish will come right up to you and eat! It's funny - a good 100 fish swimming all around you - almost more fish here then when you are snorkelling! They have a hotel photographer who takes random pictures of the hotel guests and he does a really good job! He goes to each resort in the morning and brings along his parrots and iguannas for the pictures. In the afternoon he is on the beach and can take some really romantic shots for you. You don't have to buy the pictures unless you want them. They are posted in the lobby at 6pm and you pay 6-8 US for each. The nightly entertainment is good. The animation team works from 10am to 2 am. They are poolside all day, then do the night show, and then go to the disco to keep the guests going all night. They do a really good job and are always happy. The staff at the resort work really hard to please their guests. The managers are always walking around and making sure you are happy. It must be really hard to work 14 hours a day but they do it. And always with a smile. They don't make a lot of money..our waiter told us he makes $120 a month! Some of us make that in a day! We tipped regularly and they are very appreciative and deserving of it. The only thing the resort could use more of is security. I only saw security 3 times the whole week I was there. At other resorts we've been at there is one standing outside each building. Restuarants is the worst part of the resort. The benefit is that you have 3 resorts to choose from to eat and drink at...the thing is; they all serve the same food at every meal! So there is no variety, if you are sick of your buffet - the Playacar + Yucatan have the exact same thing as the Tequila. Of course I don't know if supper is the same because you have to eat at your own resort for supper; but I imagine it's the same. They do serve Chicken, Fish, Beef and Pork at every meal along with the salad bar and the fruit bar. Then there is all the sides (fries, rice, mashed potatoes, pasta etc). But its gets quite repetitive come the 3rd and 4th day. We pretty much ate the same thing for supper almost every night we were there. We did manage to get into the Steakhouse one night which was really good. The best meal I had there all week. The other thing is that they have 1 restaurant for breakfast, 1 restaurant for lunch and 1 restaurant for supper (aside from the a la cartes which are hard to get into). At the Occidental we had 3 or 4 restaurants to choose from for each meal. Granted you can go to the other RIU resorts for lunch...but it's not different food. They have \"snacks\" available untill 2am. Theis consists of either hamburgers or hotdogs (it alternates each night). The staff in the restaurants are great though. They work hard to please and try to make the lines snappy - as they do tend to line up. There is a disco on site and it's ok some evenings. The Yucatan has one as well and it plays more up-to-date music! Not a lot of people stay up for the disco, most go to bed at 11pm after the show. So it's not crowded in there. Went into Playa Del Carmen one night to Senor Frogs and Carlos and Charlies.....better in Cancun. These bars are really small and only hold a few hundred people. The ones in Cancun hold a good thousand people! Playa Del Carmen has great shopping, cheaper than Cancun. The ocean is right there as well so you can go for a dip if it get's too hot. The locals who come to the hotels are realy expensive...and some of the locals who are on the beach are expensive too. The cheapest place to get anything is in town. For example braids in my hair cost $35 at the resort, $20 on the beach and $15 in town. Another Example was a \"playacar\" picture frame costs $20 at the resort and $6 in town! Shots Glasses - $5 on resort and $1 in town! Big Difference. The taxi ride to Playa Del Carmen is $4 and the walk is a good 2km. - but nice! Not much else to say about the resort, probably will not be going back...will stick to the Occidental chain; but would reccomend RIU Tequila to anyone. Just personal preference that's all.

I'm only 5'7\" and I had no leg room. People all around me were complaining to their seat mates about how little room there is between the seats. If you have a choice go Air Transat. The shuttle Bus to the resort was effecient, sit on the left so you can see the other resorts as you pass by. The Tequila had clean rooms, an ugly hospital green decor, and a lovely mini bar ( Free!) with Corona, Bottled Water, Pop, and a 24 oz bottle each of Rum, Vodka,Gin, and Tequila. Free. Honest! The washroom was clean but tired looking. It had been re-caulked in the shower several times to a not very high standard. Water pressure and temp were fine. Beds rock hard. Pillows the size the airlines give you. Bring your own. This resort is 5 star in the ads but I would think more like 4 star in reality. The grounds are clean but not as perfect as others I've seen, nor is the landscaping as meticulously maintained as others. The beach is a healthy 10 minute walk away ( remember it's 30 degrees out and the kids are whining) or take the shuttle which runs almost every 15 minutes with a 90 minute break from 1:30-3. It only takes about 10 passengers and there is no organized line up for those waiting. Expect a bit of a free for all when the cart arrives! The beach was extremely crowded! Perhaps a thousand or two loungers on the sand! Go early if you want one! Watch out for the flying volleyballs and parasailing salesmen. If you are looking for a peaceful and romantic beach go to another resort. There are 4 resorts using this same beach! We ate in the dining room and pool area snackbar only and didn't bother with the 2 ala carte restuarants- one of which is the seafood restaurant which is a 10 minute walk away in the Riu Yucatan. The food was excellent with a variety choices. If you're on the Atkins diet you'll love this place! Baron of beef, sirloin steaks,spiced pork, baby back ribs, grilled tuna, grouper, stuffed salmon, chicken, ham, bacon etc. We stayed at the Bahia Principe Akumal last year and found the food at the Riu better prepared and with more choices. This resort is kid friendly with a cheerful staff and a great animacion' team. They tried hard to get everyone involved in activities. Expect a party atmosphere and avoid the swim up bar if offended by drunk partiers. Would we go back? mmmm, probably not. I think we'll spend a little more to get an ocean front resort with a quiter beach.

We upgraded to a beautiful suite which was a bit of a stroll from the main resturant, but was welcome after stuffing ourselves at the great buffets and the steak house (our favorite!) We had FLAWLESS service from housekeeping to resturant staff, activity staff and pool bar servers! The grounds, again, were beautifully maintained and you see staff everywhere tidying up. The pool is huge and kept very clean-a bit chilly though until you just jump right in and aclimate to the water temp, so go for it, it really is refreshing after 60 seconds! The pool chairs are \"reserved\" by guests who seem to go out BEFORE the crack of dawn, to claim a spot with towels, sunscreen a lone shoe or book etc., so its tough sometimes to find a spot even though its CLEARLY posted not to do this. We really dont miss, at all, being right on the beach. It really is a short, covered walk, to the beach or you can hop a ride on the golf cart. The Tequila is the BEST property we've been to in the area and would recommend it to EVERYONE! Great value. Fun, involved staff, really good food, clean rooms and lots of extras!

Flew our to London Ontario which was a breeze. No problems in Cancun airport. RESORT-beautiful-all the RIU's looked very nice.STAFF- this is what makes this resort what it is. They are the best. I cant say enough we tipped all who we could. Everyone should. Didnt see many tipping and didnt think it was right. They work so hard, and really try to please. Very frendly.FOOD-Good for a few days well presented very good selection. Found that it was the same stuff every night and day with they odd little thing added here and there. Best crapes we ever had. There was some really good stuff. No prime rib,no roast anything all week. Lots of shrimp and fish and flat but tasty steaks.Ribs were not too good.All the fruits and salads you could eat. Big line ups, seating times I believe cause that, you have assinged table and your basically sitting with people you dont know because the tables are right beside each other. I was just tired of it after a few days. ROOMS-very clean, very musty smelling but didnt notice it for long, air barely works, hate to see it when the humidity hits in the summer. Toilet had no ventelation so had a bad smell embeded in to the walls, the smell never left the room. Nice big shower, Walls paper thin, you could here everything out side the room. it might be just me but the green walls are very cold and depressing colour. Hard beds but dont know a resort in Mexico that has soft beds. We slept well. Maids did great towel art. We were in at 12 and didnt get out room till almost 4. We were ok cause we took the timed 7 minute walk to the beach and swam in the ocean. POOL- good temp around 75-80 clean. Very busy its March but not near enough chairs for visitors. Got to sit at the side of the pool that was our spot. We are on vacation and dont get up at the crack of dawn. The Playacar beach you could uaually get chair on the beach but the other RIU no. The pool bar was a fun spot met lots of nice people and also encountered not all but a few peoples uncontroled, bad male kids on floats constantly splashing people and making a horrible noise non stop, I felt like going and finding there parents and asking them to controle there kids. Very rude. Mine would not be allowed to behave like that. The resort is filled with families so if your looking for a quiet, relaxing place dont go to this resort in March, off season might be ok. I didnt feel it was big enough to accomidate the amount of people that were there. Every night was kids on stage, very kid friendly place. They did a good job. SHOWS- good, they did a good job think all the resorts the shows seem the same but good. We were going to watch the Micheal Jackson show but after the first little part we realized we had seen it at the Barcelo Maya almost 2 years ago. The guy goes around to the different resorts, It sure looked like the same guy. Tuesday RIU TEquila, Friday Barcelo Maya. BOOZE- very weak, great bar staff, they are so clean they dont even touch the straws. Drinks are well presented. Boom Booms everywhere. We tipped every night at the bar. Disco was very smelly but rocken little place. Lots of teens in there. But a good little disco. All in all this is a good family resort, its very popular but not for us I would not return to an RIU not just this one any, they all seen the same from what I see and read I cant even put my finger on what the exact problem, I felt it was lacking something, 3 days I wanted to go home, I guess it was just not for me .We like a bigger resort were if we want quite we can get it. But to anyone going you will like it here but dont be afraid to try other places. There are more good resorts.This was 4th all inclusive.

Thanks to all the previous reviews, we decided to stay here. While there, we checked out the riu yucatan which to me seemed a bit run down. The riu playacar was nice too but the pool much smaller and more noisy. The palace was nice but rooms had a darker feeling. THe Iberostar quetzal yucan looked like a nice resort but it would be difficult to stroll a baby/toddler around there. Terrainwas very uneven. Rooms nicer but bathrooms very small.Anyway, as mentioned in many reviews the rooms are extremely clean but basic. Green walls and green bed spreads a little too much color for my liking but fine for one week. Bathroom was large enough to accomodate our baby'scrib. Balcony great. Every morning my husband brought back coffee and we sat outside.Food: EXCELLENT! I took the kitchen tour and in a nut shell: Food is absoluetly fresh every day. What is not consumed is thrown out! They start fresh every day. HOmemade pastries, breads, ice cream etc. The veges are washed in a special washer with something to kill any bacteria. They use their own purification water. All meat is flown in daily from Canada. The large kitchen has many rooms where the chefs work on the food, ie meat in one room always, vegies in antoher. Not cross contamination ever. Kitchen was spotless.Food was the best ar the tequila. We check out the food at the other hotels and they didn't have the same variety as ours. Delicous fish, prawns , calamari, steak, chicken etc. Fresh salsa, quac and special chips made daily. All the meals were EXCELLENT and superb. The a la carte restaurants were ok in comparison. I preffered the buffets for sure.POOL huge and nice. A little cold but nice. Kids club great.We brought voice activated walkie talkies which served as a baby monitor during nap times. We could leave the room and head to the pool while the baby slept. Our room was close to the pool.Overall, great experience. Not on the beach but no problem. We went to the Playacar in the afternoons.Front desk not very friendly. Gave us a hard time b/c we checked out late. Paid 50 for that.

The good: Food was good, meals were trouble free, except the Carribean that you can make reservations for---it is at the RIU yukatan and if you book you will have to walk the 1/2 mile to the restaurant and back because the shuttle has usually finished for the day. The gardens were lush and spralling very nice. The overall resort was very clean. Yes there was a musty smell, but it is common in the area. The mini bars were stocked every other day, but if you ran out they would stock them earlier if you asked. I really liked the fact that I could get some international liquor like Canadian club, etc. The Bad: We were not able to get any chairs at our pool. We would go out at 7:00 - 7:30 a.m. in the morning and all the chairs would already be reserved by people placing towels on the chairs. Then alot of the chairs would sit there empty most of the morning. RIU need's to re-think their policy of letting people reserve chairs and then having no one showing up for hours on end when someone else could use them for a few hours etc. I think they need a monitoring system. The shuttle to the beach does not run enough and does not hold enough people so there is usually waiting involved if you do not want to walk to the beach. It's a good 15-20 Min. walk.

There were 3 of us (women ages 25-28) and we all had a great time!!! I had originally wanted to go to Cancun for the atmosphere (party, shopping etc) but I never realized that you could get that plus so much more from the Mayan Riviera and Playa del Carmen, only add alot of relaxation. The hotel itself is beautiful when you first arrive and see the lobby, it truly takes your breath away. The rooms are very clean (and yes ours did smell a bit damp) and well stocked with different beverages...pop, water, corona, and liquor. The beds are VERY hard, which took us a couple of nights to get used to, but we did. The food was good, but the service was fantastic. If you go to this hotel you have to make arrangements to have dinner either at 6:30 or 8:30 which helps to keep the lines for the buffet smaller. The maitre'ds are awesome their names are ChaCha and Leo...super friendly, they even gave us hugs good bye:( The entertainment each night is fantastic. The dancers are the same people you will see and meet around the pool during the day. They do the games and the aerobic classes with the guests. None of us girls have kids yet but if and when we do this is definitely a place I would bring them...the staff really seem to have fun with the kids and interact with them through music and dances geared towards children. There were many children at the resort, but they were always kept so busy with the entertainment staff, that I never realized how many were at the resort until the end of the night at the show when they would all get on stage and sing and dance. As I said all the shows were great...but if there is only one that you can make...Definitely let it be the Michael Jackson tribute! There is a disco on the resort called \"The Pinata\" which is really good, there are different types of music played each night (ex. Disco, Techno, 80's&90's, and current radio hits) and there were all ages having a great time each night. The hotel is only a ten minute bike ride (which you can rent really cheap at the resort or a motorized scooter) to the downtown area of Playa Del Carmen where it's about 6 or so streets of shopping and bartering..I bought some really nice (real) silver really cheap. We went down there a couple of times to shop and still didn't get to see everything...there's a Senor Frogs and Carlos and Charlies down there as well as many other restaurants and bars if interested in eating or partying there. We did 2 excursions the first was the Mayan Adventure which cost approx. 70 U.S. where you leave at 8am and get home at 6pm... a long day but very much worth it. You go snorkling through caves and tropical lagoons, as well as you can jump of a cliff. your lunch is included which is prepared by Mayans who still live in huts and live off the land. The second excursiom was the Dolphin Discovery. 160 U.S. and this for me was worth the money just to be able to touch and swim with the dophins. The rest of the excursion wasn't what I expected. The boat was really rocky, the snorkling was only about 1/2hour and the water was cloudy the day we were there so that didn't help. We walked over to the neighbouring Rius...Yukatan, and PlayaCar, and not to sound biased but the Tequila is much nicer even without the beach. So if you are reading this and have already booked your trip to the Tequila...have a super time...say hello to ChaCha and Leo for me, and you have to try a BananaMama...delicious:)", "Date": "March 6, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Green Bay, WI", "Title": "\u201cWow, unbelievable!!

The staff are the most frindly I've encountered anywhere we've traveled, they are always saying hello and very eager to please. The entire resort is exceptionally clean all the time as the staff works extremely hard. A really great feature is the ability to walt to and use the other 2 Riu resorts, it really expands your facilities. This was our first trip to Mexico and wasn't sure what to expect, the people at the airport, Playa Del Carmen and the taxi drivers are soooo friendly. The Riu is in the Playa Car complex and is a gated area that is beautiful and extremely safe you can go for walks even at night and feel safe. We went to see the Mayan Ruins in Tulum and they are well worth the trip they are along the coast overlooking a cliff down to the turqoise ocean with a beautiful white sand beach. The entertainment at the hotel is really good, some shows we liked better than others, but always entertaining and they work sooo hard! The entertainment staff during the day works very hard also and really trys to get you involved with one of the many activities that are availble The entire resort is gorgeous! The staff is extremely friendly and very eager to please you! The lobby is breathtaking when you arrive, we were greeted with wecome drinks and made to feel very welcome. The grounds and buildings are very tropical! We saw 3 monkeys high up in the trees when we were at the Riu Yucatan across the street. It is a relly great bonus to be able to use the facilities at the other 2 Riu resorts. The pools are beautiful, but there is a shotage of chairs, people start reserving them by putting there towels on at sunrise. They should add about 100 more loungers. The swim-up pool bar is great and the bartenders are hard-working and very friendly. The htel is in the gated complex of Playa Car with brick steets, beautful landscaping and you can safely walk aroud even at night.

Rooms were great, we enjoyed the beer, water and pop which was always stocked in the room. We also enjoyed the \"liquor dispensor\", and had a few tequila shots before going out at night. The beach is gorgeous.. the ocean was very warm and since the pool was very cold, spent alot of time swimming in the ocean. They offer free boogie boards, paddle boats, kayaks, and hobie cats (for the hobie cats you need to pay an initial $35 for a lesson, then free the rest of the week). The Tequila is not too far of a walk from the hotel, but the golf-cart that transports you back and forth is not always reliable, so plan on walking alot. The food was above average, they served soft serve ice cream starting around 10a.m. in the morning until about 6p.m. by the pool, which kept my son quite happy. My son also had plenty to do at the Riu including bocceball, tennis, ping-pong, bingo, etc. They had a wonderful kids club from 3:30-4:30 where the kids (usually age 5-12 or so) played basketball, soccer, etc. near the tennis courts. Carolina who runs the kids club is wonderful. He also enjoyed the kids disco in the evening, starting around 8:30. They did dances on the main stage, then games, then off to the disco for a movie which game us some time to have a few cocktails and enjoy the entertainment during the movie time. The drinks were great, the staff were very friendly. We did tip because they were so great but didn't really feel like we needed to, they don't expect you to tip. The steak restaurant which you need to make reservations for was awesome, one of the best meals I've ever had. And the seafood restaurant (which is at the Riu Yucatan) was also great.

We would recommend any of the Riu hotels. they are all great.", "Date": "February 1, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Burlington, Ontario", "Title": "\u201cHighly Recommended - Fantastic Trip, Fantastic Resort\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1612908", "Content": "My husband and I are Canadian, both in our early 30 s, and we stayed at the Riu Tequila from January 5-19th, 2004. The resort is delightful and of superior quality and deserves all it s stars. In the past few years we have stayed at resorts in the Mayan Rivera, the Dominican Republic and Cuba. We would not hesitate to return to the Riu Tequila! The guests at the resort range in ages and nationalities. There appears to be a large contingent of Canadians, however there were also American and European guests. Given the time of year (just after Christmas), there were not a lot of children, however, there were still quite a few, and they managed to have fun with one another. Here are some of the things we noted about the hotelCheck-In and Check OutThe whole process was smooth. Make sure you have everything ready at both check-in (your confirmation) and check out (your towel cards, safe lock and key, room key) and everything should go rather quickly. Check-In time is 3 p.m. Check out is at noon. There are change huts by the pool and a locker room with a shower in the lobby, so no matter what time you arrive or depart, the day will not be a waste if you pack a swimsuit in your carry-on. There is a luggage room to keep your belongings safe, so you needn t worry about lugging things around the resort.RoomsThe rooms are average. As you may have read elsewhere, there is a musty smell to them. We solved that by bringing both candles and a Glade Plug-in. The beds are rather hard, but it didn t seem to bother us after the first night. There is no light in the shower but you don t need one. The bathroom area can be curtained off separately, which is a nice feature, especially if you want to block the light or want the patio doors open. We were on the first floor of building 11. I think that I would want a second floor room next time as I felt a little exposed leaving the curtains open while on the first floor. You can arrange for maid service to arrive at the same time every day, but the rooms are usually cleaned by noon. There is a safe, be sure to keep all your personal belongings plane tickets, passports, tourist card in here, noone will ask to see them during the trip or if you leave the resort. There is a small mini-bar that is restocked every other day. It has bottled water, Pepsi, 7-up, Miranda and club soda. There s also a wet bar with tequila, vodka, rum and gin.Resort Facilities. Activities, Shows and StaffI m sure there are things we never took advantage of at the resort, however something we did enjoy was the internet caf\u00e9 in the lobby. For $8 US, you can have an hour of internet time to use throughout your stay (you don t have to use it all at once). It s much cheaper than trying to call home!! The resort also has two email accounts you can use if you don t have one of your own. We were not able to use our cell phone so email was the way to go! There are tennis courts and sports equipment available. You may also take advantage of the facilities at the neighbouring Riu Yucatan and Riu Playacar.Like most resorts, activities run daily. In the morning there is stretching, aqua fit, water polo and Spanish lessons. There s also darts, bocci ball, ping pong, shuffleboard, and rifle shooting. There are dance lessons in the late afternoon and Bingo. Throughout your stay there may be different themed activities like a beach party or \"crazy\" games. If you are by the pool staff may encourage you to participate but they are not pushy if you say no. Participate as often or as little as you d like!In the evenings there are a variety of activities from 8pm for the children the Mini-Disco and games on the stage. By about 9 or 9:30 a guest game is on the stage and the evening show begins at 10 p.m. Although there was plenty of seating, if you have the late dinner sitting it is unlikely that you will get a place to sit anywhere near the stage. The shows were similar to what you see at many resorts in the Caribbean including lots of dancing and lip-synching. They were often entertaining, and of good quality. If you arrive on a week when the Michael Jackson show is playing be sure to get a good seat! It is amazing and almost spooky when you see how real \"Michael\" looks and acts! After the show, if you re up to it, be sure to attend the Disco, guests from the neighbouring Riu s come over as well.The staff was more than friendly and always helpful. Be sure to leave a tip for the maids, and you will find a menagerie of towel animals in your room! The Animation staff is fantastic and fun.Beach and PoolThe beach is a good 10-minute walk from your room. If you go across the street and slightly to your right, you will find the walkway especially for the Riu Tequila guests. It runs between the Riu Yucatan and Riu Palace hotels. It is a lovely walk, or you can take the shuttle from the lobby if you prefer to ride. At night the walkway is gated and padlocked sometime between 10:30pm and 11:00pm, so don t find yourself trapped on the beach (you can always walk up through one of the other resorts!)The beach has plenty of loungers and palm trees for shade, as well as places to eat, play volleyball, play in the sand and swim!! There are no rocks or shells on the beach or in the water, so you don t need to worry about surf shoes.The pool is quite chilly at this time of year. One of the staff members said she had not been in the pool since October. However, once you are in it is nice and refreshing for a quick dip. They also had water aerobics every day so it couldn t have been too cold! In order to get the lounger of your choice you have to be up by 7 am, but there are usually loungers that can be found until at least mid-morning.Restaurants and FoodThe main restaurant is open for breakfast and for dinner. There is a relaxed dress code at dinner wear shoes, and no tank tops for men. Shorts are allowed in the restaurant part of being a \"club hotel\". You will find that people do dress up for dinner as well.Lunch can be eaten at the beach or at the Jalisco restaurant by the pool, which is also where the Steak House is. The Jalisco serves a continental breakfast from 10:30 until noon and then lunch until 3 pm.There are two seating times for dinner in the winter the first sitting is at 6:30 until 8:00, and the second is from 8:30 until 10:00. You pick your sitting when you first arrive and then the same table is reserved for you every dinner. There are no worries about finding a clean or empty table!!Be up before 8 am to make a reservation for on of the specialty restaurants. The Steak house is delicious.The food is very good. There should be no problems finding something to suit everyone s tastes. At every meal you will find no less than 8 main courses as well as typical \"North American\" food like french fries, pizza, mashed potatoes and veggies. At lunch there are always hot dogs and hamburgers if you re missing the taste of home! In two weeks there was never a time when I couldn t fill my plate with things that I enjoyed!Day TripsWe went on three day trips while we were there.Chichen Itza is a full day of sightseeing to the biggest of the Mayan Ruins in the Yucatan. It s a full day trip (12 hours from start to finish) including an almost 3 hour bus ride each way. You do make stops at a small market on the way there and a small town on the way back. Buffet lunch is included, but we did not eat lunch until almost 3pm, so you may want to bring snacks with you. A bottle of water is provided, but given all the walking you will be doing, you may want to bring some water from the hotel as well. Our tour guide was Norma, and if you are lucky enough to get her you ll learn more about Chichen Itza and Mayan culture than you ever thought possible. Prices are approximately $69 US/adult and $40/child.Nohoch Jungle Crossing (www.alltournative.com) is a day of snorkeling, kayaking and exploring, travelling on a Unimog 4x4 all-terrain vehicle. The highlight is snorkelling in a cenote, which is part of the underwater cave system. When you go to the ranch where you have lunch, you get to snorkel in two of these fresh-water cenotes, which beautiful even to experienced snorkelers. The kayak trip is a little long, and the snorkelling in Punta Soliman is in brackish water but the cenotes make up for it. It is about an 8-hour day, with pick up time just after 8 am and drop off between 4 and 5. Cost approx. $83 US/adult and $70/child.Xel-Ha (www.xelha.com.mx) is a must see. It is an eco park where you will see all kinds of beautiful marine life and snorkel. For the more adventurous try the cliff jumping or the snuba (extra cost), or just drift down the river in an inner tube! There are trails to walk along, hammocks to sleep in and quiet spots to sit and relax. It is an adventure noone should miss. Lunch, transportation, snorkelling equipment, towels and lockers are included in the all-inclusive price of $74 US/adult, $42/child. If you already have snorkelling equipment you get a day pass and transportation for $54/adult $39/child. Passes are available at the gate $26/adult (or $20 on weekends) so if you can split the $33 taxi ride with someone, you may come out cheaper. You can buy lunch at one of the restaurants or you can bring some food from the resort ;)Playa Del Carmen a $4 US, 5-minute taxi ride from the resort (or a \u00bd hour walk) You will find souvenirs cheaper here than even the Mexican street near the resort. It s busy and many of the shops will sell the same items.Be sure to check into other day trips as well. Not every tour runs every day so plan ahead!Tulum & Xel-Ha combined - $103 US Tulum Express tour - $69 US Coba Jungle Safari - $75 US Xcaret Eco Park - $75 US Aquatic Expedition - $75 US Swim with Dolphins - $119 US Cancun City and Shopping Tour - $28 US What to Be Sure to BringSunscreen The eco-parks will only allow bio-degradable sunscreen. Air freshener or candles for the room Beach towels from home to reserve a lounger American currency is good everywhere, although you can convert to pesos if you wish Thermal mugs to keep your drinks cool on the beach or by the pool A sweater for the cooler nights you may need it in the winter months A positive and relaxed attitude!!Have fun and enjoy your trip!

The GOOD: very pretty and sprawling low rise resort, great lobby, great food for an AI (plentiful and problem free meal times), rooms with a well-stocked mini bar, nice large pool but COLD this time of year without any HOT jacuzzis in site - so looking at the pool is all we did! Nothing under 4 feet either. Childrens pool ? There really isn't one that we would put our kids into. The BAD: first floor rooms musty and need to be redone, \"everything \" is a WALK (even from your room to your lobby is a 20-25 min rdtp -really). This was OK for us and our 9 yr old but a big PROBLEM for my family with children under 5 and parents over 70. WHy? Because \"with this group\" IT's another 20 min walk to the beach (shuttles do not hold that many people or run as often as you would like), poor water pressure in showers, not very informative or friendly staff compared with other facilities in PDC. Entertainment is NOT a reason to stay here as the entertainment staff rotates nightly between the other 2 sister Rius that you can go to- Yucatan and Playacar. Don't bother with Yucatan and if you can afford it, stay at the Riu PLayacar, quiet and friendly. All Riu resorts in desperate need for children events/activities between 7p - 9p ( versus running around on a dark stage or into the adult crowd in the lobby).

The bedrooms were a nice size, large bathroom area and good storage space.......and mini bar and optics....what can I say !

My suggestion would be some kind of sunbed patrol ! So a tip.......if you can't get a bed round the Tequila pools take the short walk to the sister hotel across the street, to the left of the Riu Palace (can't remember the name) as you can eat lunch here as well.

What a trip. We vacationed there over Christmas (Dec 19-28) and had a great time. There's so much right with the RIU Tequila, any quibbles seem trivial. First off, the staff is excellent and sincerely try to make your stay the best. They have the best demeanor and a great sense of humor (\"Welcome to the RIU Yucatan\" as our airport bus was pulling away). Forget the complaints about the beach being so far away. First of all, it's not (five minute walks, tops) and second of all, the shuttle runs about every 5-7 minutes). The bars are great, just tell them what you want and how you want it fixed and they won't forget (it helps their memory if you slide them some folding money, but that's optional). The reservation-only dinners are nice, but the food in the main dining room is so good, it really isn't worth the effort. They put on a great Christmas show and treated our 5 year-old daughter like the princess she is! They are linked to several other (more expensive) RIU hotels on the beach and you can eat and drink at all but one of them. Here's some pointers: 1) If you're American, don't be such a putz. I was embarrassed by the behavior of several adult parents who were boorish and disrespectful to the hotel staff. Be an ass on your own turf; these people work way too hard to take crap from classless strangers. If you're French, go somewhere else. And for gawd's sake, if you're Canadian, leave a friggin' tip once in a while.... 2) Bring a plug-in room freshener and if your luggage can spare it, a small dehumidifer (very popular in Japan). The rooms are musty and the pillows and sheets are only changed every couple of days. The beds are firm and the pillows firmer, so if that's not to your liking, bring your own pillows. 3) Spider bait. Hate to say it, but this time of year there are some big country-a$$ spiders walkin' about. I threw a shoe at one of them and she threw it back. Seriously, some DDT would go a long way here. 4) Take the Coba and Chichen-Itza tours offered by APPLE (and other tour groups). It's awesome. 5) Buy a T-shirt that sez \"I DO NOT want a Time Share\" and wear it every time you go to 5th avenue. 6) Make some friends with the Europeans. This is not Cancun, this is Playa del Carmen. Have a go at Spanish, French or Italian. 7) If you're Canadian, for cryin' out loud, leave a tip once in a while.

Make sure you bring everything you need. Necessities are expensive in the hotel gift shop. If you have to buy something, you might want to go into Playa Del Carmen or to the Playacar Plaza down the street. THe Playacar Plaza has a good selelction, and they do not hassel you like in town. The only complaint that I have with the RIU Tequilla is that the exercise room isn't very big and it is shared with the Playacar and the Yucatan.

Rooms The rooms are very nice although yes they did have a slight musty smell but I think that is just due to humidity and just need to keep the room aired but they were nicely decorated and very clean. We were often greeted with amazing towel sculptures left by the cleaner which was a nice touch. Food The food was plentiful, fresh and very good, my boyfriend is a chef and he was very satisfied with the food especially for the number of people they are catering for. Although you could eat down at the beach club restaurant at lunch we much preferred to head back from the beach in the afternoon for a late lunch at Lupita at the Tequila. Drinks Its great having the mini bar in your room so you can sit out on your balcony with a cool drink and this was restocked every 2 days. Cocktails were good and I thought that the ones at the Tequila seemed stronger than the yacatans. For a quiet evening drink you have the bar in Lupita by the pool but if you want to be where all the action is there is the kiosk bar off reception where you will be entertained by the nightly shows that take place. Beach The Beach is about a five minute walk from the hotel through a lovely tree shaded walkway so a nice little walk....and after all the food you need it.

The beach is lovely and lots of loungers to laze around on....to get a prime spot though we often went down to the beach before breakfast and placed our towels on some loungers as after 10.30 till lunch time you may have trouble getting a lounger. Take a walk along the beach away from the hotels and you will find lovely quiet coves....Beautiful Excursions We thought that these were quite pricey, so might be best to shop around to try and get a bargain. One thing we did do was a 2 hour quad bike through the Jungle it was excllent you get to swim in a cenote, see a bit of a mayan ruin and a go into a cave....as well as whizzing through the jungle on your quad bike.....muddy but fun.....it is only a 5 min taxi ride from the resort and the guys at the Scuba caribe hut can book it for you...recommend it We also took the Ultramar ferry to Cozumel, I advise this on a very calm day as the sea can be quite rough as I found out the day we went, I was hanging onto the seat for dear life....funny when you look back but not at the time..... All in all an excellent vacation.......

Our flight out was 3 hr 45 min. Great to have such a short trip! Suntrips is inexpensive, but you get average flight times (arrived Cancun at 5:45pm and departed on the 8th at 8:00am). Had to leave the hotel to catch the bus to Cancun at 4:45am! We knew this up front, so cannot really complain. It is just we partied with new friends the night before we left. Felt a little hazy getting up at 4am. The RIU Tequila was a great place to stay. The hotel is very nice. We had room 722 on the second floor, relatively close to the pool and main building. The room was great. No complaints. The beds were firm and my wife brough a pillow. I did fine between the rum and tequila and the hotel pillows. Never remember a night that I was not sleeping well. The food was great for the most part. We spent most of our time going to the mexican food buffet area or the BBQ (great BBQ). We both gained a few pounds during the trip, so how can we complain about the food? The only disappointing part was that they only served the shrimp tostadas once while we were there. We did an excursion to Xel-Ha (1472 pesos for 2 people for the all inclusive). We did the all day, all inclusive one. Got dropped off (others were going on to Tulum for the morning), had breakfast and then floated and snorkeled the river. It was great. Very important to get there in the morning before all of the crowds show up and clouds up the water. We had lunch there (very good) and several margaritas and hiked and snorked more. A great place to spend the day. We also did the Altournative Tours to Pac-Chen (1900 pesos for 2 people, all inclusive) where we repelled into a Cenote (cave), rode a zip line across a lagoon, canoed and had a great Mayan meal in Pac-Chen. The repelling was a blast since we had never done that before. Swan in the cave afterwards. Pac-Chen is a community of about 100 people. This company that does the eco tours is preserving the area and helping the community through employment. Many of the men in small communities live all week in the tourist areas and only come home on Sat-Sun to see thier families. This tour also took us to Coba where we walked around and climbed the highest pyramid. We spend several evenings in Playa del Carmen (eat shrimp at LaParilla). Great place. Go to the Blue Parrot for great drinks (cheap) and live music (starts at 9am). Only a 40-50 peso taxi ride (though we generally walked). Cozumel was fun. Met some great people from the UK (hi Craig and Carmella). Partied hard with them in Cozumel, on the Ferry coming back and at Carlos and Charlies in PDC. Shopping was good, but did require a lot of bargaining. Walk away if they will not meet your price. Cheapest hammocks were at a little shop on the right, just past the security gate, leaving Playacar going into PDC. We sat on the beach several evenings and one morning. The RIU Yucatan bar is convenient. Short walk to the beach. Also, we walked the beach from the RIU resorts into PDC. It was nice. Email us if you want any more info. I would stay at the Tequila again. The only really bad part was the entertainment (that is why we went into PDC in the evenings). I think that RIU should consider hiring some of the live bands we saw in PDC. Live music would have been fun (rock/blues/jazz dance music). The RIU entertainers danced well but the lip syncing was really mediocre. I think that next time we may try an all-inclusive on Cozumel, only because we may want a change and a little more access to snorkeling sites. However, if I found as good a deal again at the Tequila, I would not hesitate to go back. You can email us if you would like any more information on the area.

We got to the hotel and checked in and were given our rooms by 8 a.m. ALL the people who worked there were wonderful, ALWAYS an \"hola!\" and a smile. The grounds were kept clean, except for the one piece of glass by the pool which of course I had to step on! But my husband went to the restuarant to get some napkins and the waiter wanted to know if I need medical attention he would call an ambulance or doctor for me. A couple of days later I was walking through the same restuarant and one of the waiters wanted to see my foot. I didn't recognize him, but I guess he could see me from inside and remembered that I cut my foot. The musty smell in the room was no big deal, it's the same smell everywhere in the tropics. The food was good to great, and there was always something new at the buffets. We never made it to the ala carte restuarants because we never got up early enough - oh well. The best thing was all the people from all over the world that we got to meet while there. It was nice to vacation with others besides Americans. All in all we had a great experience at the Tequila. Next time I think we will stay at the RIU Playacar because it is on the beach and smaller and quieter.

Anyone who is about to go to the Riu Tequila - I am sooooo jealous! I'd go back tomorrow if I could afford it and didn't have to do rubbish things like working. As the other reviews state, the Riu Tequila was immaculate and the staff were always cleaning and sweeping up... the food selection was excellent, loads of choice etc.... the alcoholic drinks were slightly weaker during the day but given the amount some people drank that was a good thing... There was loads of great entertainment during the day - you can do anything from aqua-aerobics and water polo to salsa dancing and bingo... The night-time entertainment wasn't the best, but I am quite critical of things like that... and it was the same staff doing activities in the day that put on the shows at night, so they deserve some credit. Michael Jackson was very good though! One of the things that struck me was how friendly everyone was - from the waiters to the entertainers - they all treat you like a friend and it makes your holiday seem special. The beach is only about 500m away and is seriously beautiful, and wasn't very crowded while we were there. The sea was warm and there were tropical fish swimming about (although you'll see more if you go to Xel-Ha, where you can do proper snorkelling). We had the opportunity to use the facilities in the Riu Yucatan and Riu Playacar, which were useful when we were on the beach.... however I think the Tequila is the nicest hotel of the three. The pool at the Tequila was lovely and warm.... However we found we had to reserve sunbeds before going for brekkie simply because everyone else was. Finding sunbeds wasn't normally a problem though, and we were a family of five... Although the excursions were very expensive you just have to put your hand into your pocket and not be mean! It's definitely worth doing some of them... you can't go all the way to Mexico without going to Chichen Itza and Xel-Ha... we went on those trips and they were fabulous. Don't bother with the Fat Cat Catamaran trip though - it was rubbish. We didn't actually go anywhere.... just miles out to sea for about five hours. We didn't stop anywhere nice to do snorkelling or swimming and at fifty quid per person we were very disappointed with the trip. I've read the other reviews... it seems to be the Yanks who complain about hard beds and mouldy rooms... HELLO!!! It's a tropical climate and the rooms ARE prone to dampness IF you don't keep you're air con ON. Our room was immaculate... no dampness or mould, our sheets were changed daily and bugs were almost non-existant in the rooms. However there are plenty outside... so if you're prone to mozzie bites, bring loads of extra strength Jungle Formula (with at least 50% DEET) - you'll need it! If you're about to go to the Tequila - you are VERY lucky and should be thanking god you are going to such a nice place. It's better than the other hotels in the area and you will have a great time.

There was so much for them today and out of the four riu hotels, we felt that the tequila was better laid out and safer. Mainly due to the fact that it wasn't close to the beach and everything was closer to hand. So you knew that your bouys could just slip down to the beach. However, everything outside the hotel is expensive! I thought xel-ha was great!!!!! amd the fat cat was good too, though a little short for the money spent. I was really disappointed with the dolphin experience(not the swim as we couldn't do that), far to much money and far to little time spent with them. Just a couple of kisses and a few brush past. Lots of jumps etc, but we could have watched that for free from the side if we wanted to and at $49 the video, well! so take lots of money as there are lots of things to do, we spent $800 for 3 trips and try and space them out a bit if you can and don't forget the tips at the end of the holiday.

The pillows are uncomfortable -Do not brush your teeth using tap water. My entire party got very sick, do everything you can to avoid drinking the water. -Contact your medical insurance company before you leave to make sure you are covered. If you are not, buy travel insurance. My friend broke her leg during a Jet Ski accident. Believe me you want to be covered, an air lift to the US for surgery is over $10,000.00 -Bring your own inflatable devices for the swimming pool. I spent almost $20 on a little raft for the swimming pool. -Skip out on the all inclusive option at the bars in downtown Playa Del Carmen. They are all very inexpensive ($1.50 - $2.50 per drink).Most of all have fun. Enjoy the relaxing days and entertaining evenings. We met a group of people from England and they were an absolute blast!

There is a small quaint shopping village very near to the hotel.The city of Playa del carmen is a couple of miles away and costs $4 to get to by taxi. It is not the greatest town, but its worth checking out. The ferry to Cozumel leaves from there every 30 minutes for $15 roundtrip.I would have rented a car if I had known how helpful it could have been. There is a lot to do and see in the area. You can take the tours, but they are expensive and you spend a lot of waiting time on the buses. Renting a car before you go is the best idea. You drive it right to the hotel and park it there for free. If you wait until you get there a basic car is about $50 a day plus gas.Service from the employees is great. Everyone was very helpful. Be sure to account for tipping money before you go as the workers there depend on tips to earn a living. Tip the waiters, maids, bell boys and anyone else who waits on you. It will be appreciated.The room was very nice, quiet and clean.Bon Voyage!", "Date": "July 20, 2003"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "St Louis, MO", "Title": "\u201cGreat Honeymoon\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1121437", "Content": "Just got back from our honeymoon.

One common denomimator that concerns me is the mention of people getting ill here. I stayed at several hotels in the Mayan Riviera and have never been sick until I stayed here. I had to take an extra week off from work due to a bad respiratory infection. I thought it coincidental that a lot of other peope who stayed here mentioned the same thing. I'm a pretty healthy person and a nurse. I liked this hotel, the food and itsbeautiful grounds however the rooms were very damp. So damp that I found it uncomfortable to sleep some nights. We concluded that it was attributed to the lack of ventilation, cement walls and ground floor level. Others mentioned they noticed mold on the walls. So my reason for writing this is basically let people who have asthma or any related respiratory concerns know that it's a good idea you look into another neighboring hotel. There are alot of hotels on this strip where you won't find this problem. I think alot of us stayed here because the price was right it being off the beach and all. Ive stayed at several others and believe me my husband and I both agreed that the room here were the most uncomfortable.

I would definitely not hesitate to recommend it to anyone!Even though the Tequila is not directly on the beach, it is only a 5-minute walk to a neighboring property's beach, or a short ride by trolley. The beach itself is beautiful--clear and warm! Plus, the fact that the Tequila is not on the beach is more than made up for by the fact that it is a lot nicer the RIU Yucatan or the RIU Playacar. (The drinks are better, the lobby is nicer, the entertainment is more fun, and the grounds are more impressive.)In previous reviews, some people complained about the moldy rooms. However, the room didn't bother me at all, even though I'm terribly allergic to molds. It is true that the rooms smell musty--but what can you expect in this climate? On the whole, the rooms were nothing fancy, but quite acceptable! Also, the maids really knocked themselves out cleaning the room. Not only the rooms always spotless, but the maids would sometimes leave an animal made out of towels on the bed.As far as the food goes, there was a lot of variety at the buffet. We stayed for 10 days and never got tired of the food. It is beautifully presented, with ice sculptures, \"flower arrangements\" made out of fruits and vegetables, etc. The freshly blended juices for breakfast was especially nice! I will say that, at times, the food needed more spices, but the black pepper on the table helps a lot!The drinks were also quite good. I don't drink alcohol, but there's still plenty of selection of non-alcoholic drinks at the bars. Try the Merengue and the non-alcoholic Pina Coladas! We found that the drinks were much better than at the RIU Yucatan.In your free time, I recommend getting a massage at the beach. Depending on which person you ask, they are only about $30 for an hour! Also, you should definitely plan to go to Xcaret and swim through the underground river. (Just one warning about Xcaret: the evening show lasts for 2 1/2 hours. Unless, you REALLYaving at intermission.)We felt relaxed and pampered for every minute of our stay at the Tequila.

When we got on the coach at the airport, we were given our All Inclusive wristbands, so that we could take advantage of all the facilities as soon as we arrived at the hotel. At the hotel, we were greeted with a lovely cold drink and very helpful reception staff. The reception area is very impressive and has a large fountain in the middle. Our cases were taken straight to our room and a tip was not expected (what a refreshing change). The room was nice and had all the things you need even down to flannels, shower gel and shampoo which was all replaced when used. My hairdryer broke, but was replaced almost immediatly and i recieved a call from reception to check that i was satisfied (what a great service). The mini bar and optics was a nice touch, although a little boring in choice, but saying that, i learnt near the end of the holiday that i could have requested other drinks of my choice. The water and ice in the hotel is ok as it is all purified, but do not drink it from your room. As for the food, it was all good and varied and the service exellent (best steak i have ever had). My 11 yr old son is a very fussy eater and had no complaints at all. There is a wide selection of drinks and cocktails (some of which are not on the menu). Be sure to try a Dirty Monkey and a Melon Sour ( pretty much an alcoholic slush puppy). Now for the other bits in short. The pool is lovely and has it's own swim up bar, which is great and has shady areas which is a must in the red hot sun. The bar staff are very friendly and efficient and don't keep you waiting, especially Jose, Rosa and Gilluermo, who looked after me and my family very well indeed. The beach is very close and only takes about 10 mins to walk to via a private walkway and is well worth a visit, as the sand is soft and golden and the sea a clear turquoise blue. You have use of the sister hotels the Riu Yuctan and the Riu Playacar, but the Tequila b, especially Elvis and ladies if you want to see several six packs, this is the place to go ( guys don't be sad, the girls are pretty too). They all work very hard to put on several class shows, such as Grease, Moulin Rouge etc and have a guy that comes in and does a brill Micheal Jackson. There is pleanty to do for all in this resort, you will not be disappointed. I think some brits just moan for the sake of moaning, so ignore any bad reviews. The only downside if there has to be one is that the air con is not that good in the rooms and there is no air con in the dining room, but there are large ceiling fans, which provide some relief. So if that is all there is to moan about, so what, a little sweating never hurt anyone did it? Trips are all good but expensive. Took about the best part of \u00a3500 off us for 3 trips, which were all good, but a lot of money for the time you get on them. We went to XelHa, Dolphin Discovery and the Speedboat Jungle Tour (by far the best). Be aware that you need to take pleanty of extra money on these trips too if you wish to purchase photos or a video (Dolphin Discovery), as these don't come cheap.There are many others to choose from and would like to have done more, but you would need a second mortgage to do the lot. So overall, a great time was had by all and looking to try another Riu hotel next year.

The hotel itself was beautiful, the grounds were kept amazing clean, the man that cleaned our room made towel animals every day...swans, alligators, turkeys, etc. and scrubbed the room sparkling every day. The food was excellent.

I got quesadillas every day(chicken and plain).....sooo good. We didn't venture to any of the reservation restaurants but heard mixed results from people, nothing bad, just that the buffet was better. The Spanish night buffet is excellent, enormous shrimp, paella, meats, fruits, everything. Beach was beautiful, one of the prettiest I've seen, kept very clean and my friends took advantage of the snorkel and parasail and everything was wonderful. We took a scooter into town, rent around 4pm, it's only $25 for the whole night, versus $13/hr and it was alot of fun, bargaining constantly.

I was slightly dissappointed with the rooms, the beds are terrible and you will need to ask for a couple of extra pillows and blankets to be more confortable. The activities they promote during the day are volley ball and water polo game. The ocassional bingo game that a few people like to attend and for the most part everyone stays in the pool area. Wake up early to make reservations for the stake house (7:00 a.m.) if you are late you're out of luck. The stake house is only an average restaurant, it starts at 7:00 p.m. for the first seating and you barely have enough time to eat because at 8:30 they have to be ready for the second seating (9:00) for an average dinner is not really worth it. Get up early to reserve your own beach or pool chairs, people leave towels and when you get there everything is taken and again you're screwed, this is a big problem that I think a hotel with this rating should correct. My biggest problem is the check out time. They expect you to vacate your room at 12:00 noon, if you have a late flight you will have to wander around for hours before you get the ride to the airport, if you travel with small children and are not used to the really hot weather this can become a problem. Sure they tell you to go to the pool or the beach while you wait and they have a place where to change after, but remember you are not the only one in need of a nice shower, there were two families with 3 and 4 children each ahead of us, so if you don't mind smelling like chlorine go ahead and jump in the pool. Service at the main restaurant is OK. I had a really good waiter (Nicolas, thanks buddy!!) most of them can communicate and understand what you say. Take a trip to Chichen Itza but don't use the tours if you don't want to be stuck in a bus for hours. If you have a large family, negotiate a rate with one of the taxi guys, they can give you a better ride for your money anworks out to be cheaper that the tour operators.

For the previous complainers out there, what were you thinking? You can buy this trip for $1000.-$1500. Cdn. Try going to a 5 star anywhere in the Caribbean, other than Cuba or the D.R., for that price. Before I go on and on, I have to say this, no matter where you stay, from Cancun to Tulum, don't go on any packaged bus tours if you can avoid it. We went on one to Tulum and Xel-ha. The places were great but you can do this trip on your own. Two days later we rented a Jeep and we had the best vacation day of our lives. The bus tour was $200.US. The Jeep with insurance and gas was $120.US. Tulum is $3-$4US, Coba is 3.50US to get in. Xel-ha was fabulous(all kinds of fish!) and has various prices depending on what you wanted to do $40.- $80. Since we had already been to Tulum, we went to Coba. To get there you drive down the coast to Tulum and turn right into the jungle. It was an amazing drive; Coba was the highlight of the trip. It's in the jungle and there were no bugs and there were more birds than people . It's very walkable to the tallest pyramid and you can climb it if you're daring enough. Running shoes would have been great to have. From there north into jungle again and later east to Cancun's hotel zone and then south for an hour back to the hotel. This is the same route the bus tour goes on. We stopped many times and drove into small villages always feeling very safe. It was about a nine hour day and we put more than 300kms on the Jeep but we loved it! Anyway back to the hotel. This place is definately 5 star. It's set in a gated community with many other 5 stars and a 40 peso taxi to the town of Playa Del Carmen. The town is quite small and very unlike Cancun, thankfully. The hotel itself is beautiful. The lobby is open air, very large and absolutely gorgeous, especially at night.The walkways are all curved and are meant to appear to be cut out from a tropical jungle. Very nicely done! We also toured around all the other RIUs and they were much moreove the Palace. Walking to the beach was not a problem and we only took the trolley once to try it. The beach was awesome and although quite busy, there was always a lounger to lay on. Being Canadian I'm sure my next statement wont surprise anyone, but they should serve beer at the beach. They don't have a problem with you drinking on the beach(or anywhere else for that matter) you just have to get it yourself. Very warm water and a few nice waves here and there.The theatre area is very nice but the nightly entertainment was a bit lame. There were shows such as Cats and Moulin Rouge that we could have done without, but all in all it wasn't too bad.T he disco is full of the 15-25 yr. old crowd and it definately smells bad. The music in the disco is loud and lousy. They should set up another area where the thirty-plus crowd could dance and maybe even know a song or two.The rooms were just fine, nothing fancy but ours was very nice; two double beds together, a large bathroom area and a good sized shower. Our room was a corner, on the second floor with a vaulted ceiling backing onto the golf course. I would stay at any of the RIUs we saw but it would be hard to beat the value of the Tequila.", "Date": "March 30, 2003"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Minneapolis, MN", "Title": "\u201cGreat Family Resort\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR917862", "Content": "We were part of a group of six families and spent a week at the RIU Tequila in early March. We had kids ranging from 1 to 16 years and they had a ball. We all loved it and were pleased with the good food, service, drinks, pool an lovely grounds. The buffet was expansive and excellent compared to other all inclusives we have been to and the kids could get non-alcoholic fancy drinks themselves any time they wanted (a big hit along with the self-serve ice cream all day long.) The pool is wonderful and the trip to the beach was easy. We spent time at both each day but the Tequila pool was the favorite by far. The resort was full to capcity yet they were very accomodating and worked it out so all six families could be in the same unit. A couple of tips worth noting. Bring your own pillow if you can - we did and I am so glad since the beds and pillows are very firm. Second, if you like strong drinks just ask for an extra shot and tip the bartenders (we loved Veronica!) If you have kids, eat at the 6:30 seating and avoid the reserve-only restaurants as there is not enough selection to satisfy the kids and the service is slower. The resort is expansive and can be a long haul to get around for little ones and older folks. You may want to request a room that is closer to the lobby (breakfast and dinner) and also near the pool. Rooms were musty but you spend so little time there so it didn't bother us. Day trips - try Xcaret, it was spetacular and our kids loved the 30 foot fountain in the front where they ran through in their suits and got their sandals to shoot way up in the air. Everyone is our group agreed this was a fabulous vacation and well worth the money. We will definitely go back to the Tequila!", "Date": "March 16, 2003"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "ClubHotel Riu Tequila", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g150812-d219166-Reviews-ClubHotel_Riu_Tequila-Playa_del_Carmen_Yucatan_Peninsula.html", "Price": "$136 - $235*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Avenida Xaman-ha, Manzana 3, Lote 19</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\">Condominio Playacar</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Playa del Carmen</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">77710</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Mexico</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "219166", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/e3/38/e3387a76806a13f55b2b9b8ba027043e6large.jpg"}}
