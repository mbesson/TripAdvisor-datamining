I sent the hotel an email directly, letting them know that this trip was a 15th anniversary present, and that anything they could do to make it special would be appreciated. When we arrived, they had no record of our reservation. Disaster, we thought. But the very nice receptionist (whose name unfortunately escapes me) told us there would be no problem, and gave us a room. She said they knew the deal company, and since *I* had a confirmation, they'd accept that and straighten things out with the company. When I asked if they had gotten my email, she looked in the file, found it, and after reading it, took our keys back... and gave us another (I imagine nicer) room. The room was lovely. It was on the small side, cozy, really, but immaculate and clearly recently renovated. We had a view of the street, and if we stuck our heads out the window we could see the Bastille column at the end of the road. We went out for some sightseeing and dinner, and when we came back there was a lovely bottle of Champagne waiting for us with a nice note. Breakfast the next morning was quite nice, a basic continental. We checked at the desk, and found that they had contacted the agent whom we had booked the trip through, and everything was resolved. This was really a most enjoyable stay. Although we didn't have much interaction with the staff, whenever we did it was clear that their intent was that we didn't worry about anything, and they would make sure everything went smoothly.

We were in Paris for only two nights and the first night, we saw the tower from our balcony, the second night, we were sat on the grass along with hundreds of other people, right by the tower watching it light up and sparkle right in front of us. Breakfast was lovely, plenty of choice and served by a lovely lady who was really friendly and welcoming. On our first morning, I went down very early and asked for some tea. I was expecting a kettle and tea bags etc, but the nice lady actually made me a pot of tea which I then took back up to our room. We went down later for breakfast. All the staff on the reception desk were very helpful. On our first morning, it was a lady who was very friendly and efficient, she was also there on our last morning and helped us with metro directions to Gare du Nord for the Eurostar when a massive parade/demo completely gridlocked the streets so a taxi was out of the question. There was also a gentleman there and on the second day, two younger ladies. All the staff were kind, friendly and helpful. All in all, we had a fantastic few days and could not have asked for more.

The Cafe d'Industrie located in a street behind the hotel is a great venue, the food was reasonably priced and the service great too. Another restaurant we would recommend is Chez Clement, located on Blvd Beaumarchais (10 min walk) offered a two course set menu including a drink for only 13.90 Euros each during August, not much choice but good quality food. A slightly cheaper bar for drinks is the Cafe Martini which is located near Place du Vosges. Here you can buy \"almost a pint\" of Stella for 5 Euros, whereas most other bars charge you anywhere from 6-8 Euros.

We drank in the lively bars in Bastille, and found a great little trendy party area, friendly young creatives, a great place to people watch and have fun. We also shopped the many shops in Le Marais, and loved the vintage and antique shops especially, this felt more fun and relaxed than the centre of Paris which can be a bit manic and pricey. We love walking, and so found this area fine for getting about, we walked down to the river, and in and out of the little lanes, and enjoyed every moment! We also bought a two day Batobus pass and jumped on and off the boat to see the sights. On Thursday the market is on, right outside the hotel, so it's a good one to visit if you like your food. We ate a couple of times at Cafe Sully which had gorgeous food, and at La Tartine which is on Rue de Rivoli, which had lovely food, although it was a bit bonkers sitting by such a busy road.

As arrived, they put us in an extremely small room at 6th floor, where there was not even spacve to put outr two luiggages. We asked to have a bigger room, so they put us in a room for disabled people at ground floor, saying it was thwe biggest of the hotel. It was just slightly bigger than the other, and facing the hotel patio, so that was not possible to keep curtains open. The bed was too small for two persons, and there were noises when peopole came in the (small) lobby of the hotel just in front of the room. Nearby was a toilet, so we had the pleasure to hear the sounds. More than one time the waitress opened the room door without knocking. A mid aged guy at the reception was kind and spoke english, but the girls where totally uncooperative, and with the typical sciovinist attitude that you may find in Paris. Hairdryer was not working, but i didn't bother to ask for a change, as did not want to got through hassles. Air conditioning was non existent. Only good thing was the position, but there are better places. It was expensive for the quality offered. I would not return to it.

Turns out the hotel had undergone a refurbishment in 2010, but this was not extended to the entire hotel, as I was placed in room 64, which had not been refurbished to the standard of all the other rooms which had been widely displayed on the website and on trip advisor. The room had a dated decor, separate toilet to the bathroom, but the strangest thing was the door to the room was hidden behind another door?! very weird. Apart from the room, being incredibly deceiving the hotel was nice. I did try to get moved to a refurbished room, but the hotel was fully booked. The location is perfect for getting the best of both, sightseeing but also enjoying local life, as there is a busy farmers market on a Sunday morning, where you can sample foie gras and cheese. My only complaint is that the room was a total fabrication to what was advertised and that let me down as I thought I\u2019d be getting a much more modern experience.

There is also a little shop right round the corner where you can buy drinks to put in your supplied fridge.

In our room we found the same bright furnishings, a very comfortable bed, hot shower, and also the addition of a digital room-safe proved very useful. What had not changed was the friendly and helpful welcome from the proprietors and staff. As other reviewers have commented, the location of the hotel is great for exploring Paris - 3 Metro lines run from Bastile. Exploring on foot, many discoveries can be made alongside the better known attractions, and a surprising amount of ground can be covered e.g. to the Isle St. Louis in about 15mins.

Directly next to Breguet-Sabin Metro stop. Also close to Bastille metro stop. Pleasant staff that were polite and helpful. Some were warmer than others. They did have an odd rule of insisting that you leave your room key card with them each time you left the hotel. It's not uncommon to drop off your key, but the insistence aspect was a tad strange. Overall, this was a simple, no frills hotel. Room: Small, but comfortable. The same applies for the bathroom. If you can get a room that does NOT face the light well, the better for you. Even though Richard Lenoir is a busy street, I would have preferred to have had a room with more light in it. Our room was quite dark. I will say that they respected my wish not to be near an elevator and that was kind of them to do. The floors are small. There is a charming semi-spiral staircase that connects the floors and suprisingly there are two elevators that service the floors. Get a room that is as far away from the elevators as you can. Bathroom was small, but clean and decent. BTW - House cleaning staff did a nice job each day. Cost: 530 Euro for 4 nights which we thought was reasonable. Breakfast was not included. It costs Euro 13 per person and was NOT good. So, after one breakfast there, we skipped the others and ate out. Also the breakfast room is set up in the hotel \"crypt\". That means no windows. Not a very nice space. Location: Pretty good and all of Paris was very easily accessible through the Metro system, including RER lines. Get a pass when you get to Paris as you don't want to be buying tickets all the time. Recommend: Yes, as a budget place with no frills and decent location.
