As mentioned in previous reviews, the hotel is on the 5th floor of the building, reachable by a nice old-fashioned lift. The hotel itself is quite small. It is an old building but the rooms were clean. Functional, but clean. Despite being away for our anniversary in Italy, this hotel didn't inspire much romance in us I am afraid to say! You could easily hear the neighbours next door arguing and talking. I'm not sure of the regular prices of the hotel in off season but we suspect our rates were hiked up due to the Rome Marathon which took place during our stay (which we didn't know about prior to arrival, our bad). We noticed some of the staff speak little English and on one of the mornings, I had to go out with creased clothes as the guy on reception didn't understand that we were looking for the loan of the house iron! The breakfast was fine, nothing to write home about but fine. It's very close to the metro and ideal for sightseeing if you don't have time to walk everywhere or have mobility issues.", "Date": "March 24, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Porto, Portugal", "Title": "\u201cNice Hotel, but bad employee\u201d", "Author": "Susanamoreira", "ReviewID": "UR123161381", "Content": "I stay in this hotel 2 nights and I enjoy it.

I made the check-out, and in my reservation was writted that I was free from any tax, but he forced me to pay 16\u20ac. Even when I show him the reservation, his answer was that nobody had told him anything. The only reason because I paid it was because I have to catch a plain!

He came to the desk and was not very friendly. He put us in a very small room with 2 double beds pushed together. The view was terrible, overlooking other people apartments and a business right out the window. We immediately asked for a bigger room since we would be staying for 6 nights. He told us the next day we could switch. So he put us in a bigger room. The room had a queen sized bed that was very hard with hard pillows, a bigger bathroom with a bathtub but no shower curtain. My European hair dryer wouldn't fit into the plugs so I had to use the 1960's hair dryer that was on the wall. We had a small tv with only 1 English speaking channel (CNN) which we already expected living in Europe for 4 years. The view from this room was a little better. It was overlooking a big park which we could see the bums sleeping in at night and where people were shooting fire crackers off randomly throughout the night. The walls are very, very thin. Each night I could hear the people in the rooms next to us talking and watching their televisions. I had a very hard time sleeping. I could hear people as they walked down the hall past our room talking and just walking! The pros to this hotel were that it is right by the metro. Very easy access.
