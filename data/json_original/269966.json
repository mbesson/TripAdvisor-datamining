A top class hotel in a great location. Paris is not renown for cheap hotels but we felt it was very good value for the standard of accomodation provided. The hotel is just opposite the Luxembourg Gardens a must see attraction to watch Parisians at play (even in early spring). Paris is a lot more compact than is apparent from the tourist maps and many of the great attractions are an easy walk away. We found the staff invariably friendly and helpful. Their restaurant recommendations seemed spot on - excellent food at reasonable prices seemed to be the guiding principle.

I would describe the hotel as charming, clean, convenient and comfortable. It was my first trip to Paris, and the location of the hotel made it extremely convenient to walk to several of the must-see sites. It's located on a quiet street, and there is a nearby metro station. The staff was so polite and helpful. My husband had a bad cold, and they recommended the type of medicine to get and showed us to a nearby pharmacy. Cecilia even made him a special tea when we'd come back from sightseeing. We ate breakfast there almost every day because it was convenient with plenty of good offerings from yogurt, cereal, fruit and delicious pastries from G\u00e9rard Mulot, Patisserie to yummy fromage omelets! The bed was very comfortable, and the bathroom was beautiful and clean with marble and updated fixtures. We spent more time in the room than we normally would have due to my husband being under the weather, and it wasn\u2019t much of a sacrifice due to the lovely accommodations.

And how lucky we were to find Hotel Luxembourg Parc. It is a small boutique hotel, reasonably priced (for Paris) located near great sights and great shopping. The staff are incredibly friendly and approachable (not always a common thing in Paris) and the rooms are very well thought out. There is nothing lacking in the rooms with the bathroom being surprisingly roomy. They can't do enough for you and even looked after some extra luggage while we travelled to Switzerland for a few days which was much appreciated. They service the rooms twice a day - the only fault was that when we put a Do Not Disturb sign on the room and came back to find it cleaned anyway. They said they feel that guests might \"forget\" when they leave the sign on when they go out. That wasn't the case, we had laid out some maps etc and didn't want anything touched. Please respect the Do Not Disturb sign for all guests. If they forget, then it's their issue.

It's premiere location directly across from the garden park on a main street with walking access to the best of the left bank, sets it up to be a winner. What closes the deal however is the staff, who realize the boutique choice is one which relies on more than size and name brand soaps. The helpful and outgoing staff lead by Fabienne are in the business of insuring the 23 room hotel lives up to it's hype here. They all succeed very well. Situated almost hidden in the midst of taller buildings and the Senate along rue de Vaugirard, the hotel stands out suddenly with its colorful green facade and flower adorned windows at the corner of a small side street. The inviting multiple entranced lobby, sitting area and small bar live up to the 4 star boutique description, along with a bright, windowed breakfast room attentively staffed and offering standard continental morning choices probably better sourced on the nearby streets if so inclined and not needing the pleasant service and surroundings. Any entry in the lobby area is immediately met with a friendly bonjour and offer for a drink or any other need. One definitely feels at home here and welcome after a long day of hoofing it around the city. An inviting wood adorned library and open air courtyard add to the look of the public areas. A fitness room was left unused by the already well exercised pedestrians in our two couples. The rooms are excellent - with good size and in some cases lovely large windows which swing open to the streets below. In the case of the front side, this is both a curse and a blessing as the street can get busy with the sounds of late night revelers in the next door bar and always requisite motorcycles speeding to the next best thing somewhere, everywhere in Paris. Wifi was free and always accessible and the large bathroom looked carved out of marble, with high end fixtures and dimmer equipped lighting showing the artwork and furnishings. A very nice place to spend downtime between sightseeing and sampling the nearly endless restaurant choices close by. This area of Paris oozes character and this location can serve as an excellent luxury base camp from which to explore the 6th and beyond. I would assume there are many other hotel choices nearby which offer some of the same maybe for less, but the driven staff and multiple designer touches make this hotel stand out and deserving of its consistent high ranking here. We will be back as it appears most others do as well. * The hotel was also able to work with us when a previous room reservation earlier in the year was unable to be kept after the cancellation deadline passed.

Had a wonderful time, here are some thoughts and tips: HOTEL I will start with the hotel itself; it is small but lovely. We have always stayed in larger hotels, so this was quite a change for us. We loved it. Our room was #15 on the 1st floor (which is actually on the 2nd story), which looks over Rue de Vaugirad into the Luxembourg gardens. The room was quite large by European standards and the bathroom was wonderful. We have never stayed in a room with so many windows (that open to a French balcony)- including the bathroom! Wonderful hardwood floors and exposed beams in the ceiling. We had plenty of room and comfort for our 5 day stay. Room had a out of sight mini bar/refrigerator which was great to store our extra water bottles and desserts we picked up. Hotel had cozy courtyard, library and small/cute breakfast room and also a small bar/lobby area. Had breakfast two of the mornings which was a lovely continental style for 15 euros each (Bob ordered bacon/eggs for a little extra!). Breakfast staff was fast, courteous and efficient. STAFF We were greeted / checked in / and settled in by Xavier. He was beyond helpful. Christian was also extremely helpful during our stay with advice on the Metro, Museum passes and he had also assisted with the arrangements for a driver upon our arrival from London via email before our departure from the USA. The staff is French, but speaks very good English, so getting directions and helpful hints was easy. LOCATION For us, this hotel was in the perfect location. On the Left Bank it seems removed from the busy streets of Paris, but it is only a short distance away. It has pretty convenient Metro stops. But the true beauty of the location is the Luxembourg Gardens. It also has a variety of cafes to choose from just a short walk away. Easy walk to our favorite - Cafe de Flore. WEATHER The weather varied from 70 - 78 degrees during the day while we were there in early August. Perfect. Coming from the southern portion of the USA, this was quite a treat in August. FYI The only caveat regarding the room; there is no alarm clock. So you must ask for a wake up call from the Front desk. We started using my iphone for an alarm. Not a big deal, just worth noting - you don't want to sleep the day away in Paris or miss a cab or tour. TIPS On the first day, we took a morning bike tour of Paris with Bike-About Tour, great way to see the area on the first day (separate review) Don't be intimidated by the Metro, plunge right into it (start with stop to stop runs, and move into transfers- quite easy once you get used to it- and saves loads of time and walking!). Christian was able to sell us a 2-day museum pass right at the front desk, and this saved us much in terms of time (don't have to wait in lines)- get it! We arrived in Paris from London via the EuroStar train (see our review on that!) We took a side trip to Normandy; see our review under Executive D-Day tours. Almost too much to talk about in this hotel review, we will try and sprinkle other reviews and tips for the various places we went and used. We loved Paris, loved Hotel Luxembourg Parc - enjoy yourself!!!!!", "Date": "August 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington DC, District of Columbia", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Service\u201d", "Author": "Amy D", "ReviewID": "UR116536300", "Content": "We had a great stay at Luxembourg Parc.

So, I would advise against paying for the balcony room, after all, you are just across the street from the Luxembourg Gardens, so having outdoor space sn't that necessary (and it is Paris, you won't be in your room often anyway). I chose this hotel because it had a workout room, but upon arrival, I was told it was closed, despite my specifically calling them when I booked to verify they had a workout room. We requested twin beds, they had a full size bed. I asked for someone to change this, and it took all day.

We actually stayed in two different rooms - we stayed for a week before heading to London for a few days and then returned to finish our Paris trip there. The hotel is in a great location - about 15 minutes walk to Pont Neuf and 5 minutes to the wonderful centre of St Germain, which is full of restaurants, markets, shops and cafes. Just across the road is the beautiful park, which is a great spot to relax or take a picnic. Lidia and the staff at the Luxembourg Parc were delightful - friendly, very helpful and a great source of information on the best places to eat or visit. Nothing was too much trouble for them and the stay was hassle free. The hotel has a lovely library and courtyard to relax in, and the breakfast option was great value, considering the quality of the meal - they will serve breakfast in your room if you request it, otherwise it is served in the gorgeous light filled breakfast room. The only negative was that our double bed was two singles put together (I know virtually all hotels do this) but they kept pulling apart which was a bit annoying. They need to secure them better.

My superior room was on the top floor. I had a window that overlooked the gardens and Rue Servandoni. I heard no noise of any kind, neither from the street nor within the hotel. It was a little oasis after a day of sightseeing. I slept like I've never slept before!The mattress was extremely comfortable with a spotlessly clean and cozy duvet. I took advantage of the deep tub daily. The breakfast room was cheery and bright. The offerings were fresh juice, three choices of cereal including muesli, yogurt, cheese and ham, a huge bowl of fresh fruit (not that gross packaged \"fruit salad\"), delicious fresh bread (also in loaf shape for toasting) amazing butter and many choices of jam, and a few choices of very high quality croissants/viennoisseries. It was completely worth the 15 euros. Coffee was served with hot milk if desired. We felt pampered. Madame in the breakfast room was lovely. There were also eggs with bacon/sausage for a little extra if desired. You could also have breakfast served in your room. The staff is what makes this place so special, with great suggestions and making calls for reservations, taxies, etc. The team of Laurent, Fabienne, Royce, Xavier, Jules and Michel were always courteous, friendly and professional. There are many wonderful bistros and cafes within a short walk. We actually never took the metro, because we walked everywhere (15 minutes to Notre Dame and the Louvre).

It is very well located in the 6th, right across from the Parc Luxembourg and a 10-minute walk from the Luxembourg RER station (Line B). There are several close Metro stations as well which are within a 5-minute walk as well. The hustle and bustle of Ave St. Germain is literally a 10-minute walk.

The sister hotel La Perle (3 *) is about 500 metres north, closer to St. Germain, and has numerous bistros, and restaurants literally outside its doors. We had most of our meals just along this strip of appetizing, typically Parisian establishments. We particularly enjoyed Ristorante Da Pietro, 12 Rue Mabillon, 75006 Paris, and Tel:[---]. They made excellent wood oven pizza as well as the usual Italian standards. Andreas Spove, the managing director and his multilingual staff (Sara, Fabienne, Royce, Xavier, Michel and Jules) are terrific and will bend over backwards to make your stay very enjoyable. An excellent hearty breakfast (15Euros/pp and half that for the kids) is served in a brightly lit room on the main floor.

Having carefully and thoroughly researched many Paris hotels, I hoped we had made the right choice. So many reviewers wrote of tiny rooms, cramped quarters, crawling across beds to get out of their room, terrible bathrooms with leaky showers, no shower curtains, noise inside and outside the hotel, and ineffective air conditioning. But this fortunately was not the case at HLP. We booked early on the internet and reserved an executive twin-bedded room for 254E per night. We were in Room 11. What a wonderful surprise to enter a beautiful large (approx 13 x 18 ft) room, decorated in Louis XV style. High ceilings, beautiful chandelier, bed side lamps, desk lamp, and recessed ceiling lighting along with 2 sets of windows, overlooking the inner courtyard, made this room bright and cheerful! Black out curtains provided late sleeping on 2 mornings! Our room had 3 closets, one of which held several drawers and the easy to operate safe, which was large enough to hold my netbook computer as well as other valuables. We also had a lovely desk, 2 comfy sitting chairs, a refrigerator, and a flat screen tv with several usual English channels (cnn, bbc). The beds were a bit soft but very comfortable, with standard European duvet/comforter, but no top sheet. The air conditioning was terrific! Individual thermostat and it kept the room quite cool (especially nice since it was very hot the 3 days we were there). The in-room free internet was excellent! The front desk gave us a code, and voila we were connected for the length of our stay. The electrical outlets were plentiful, although one set of our adapters did not work in the hotels outlets. Our second adapter did. The hotel also provides adaptors if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have your own. The bathroom was outstanding! Very large, beautiful marble, big tub/shower, and a shower curtain! The rain shower head was high up the wall (good for tall people) & in addition there was a hand held sprayer, and the tub option. Water pressure was excellent, water hot! Wonderful! The hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hair dryer was heavy, and you had to hold the button on the whole time you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re using it. But it had a nozzle-nose shape and good heat, so I was thrilled! There was plenty of space around the sink and above the toilet to spread out your toiletries too. Housekeeping did a great job replenishing towels each day, turn down service, and keeping things spotlessly clean and they were very pleasant and friendly! The hotel was super quiet! Our room was on the courtyard so we did not hear any street noise from traffic or people. We also had our windows closed and the air conditioning on. But we also did not hear any room to room noise which was a real plus! We found the staff to be extremely helpful and pleasant. Royce was the front desk person we spoke with most often. He was very patient in answering all our questions and printing our boarding passes for our flights home as well as arranging for our shuttle taxi to the airport (19euros per person) Royce speaks perfect English as he is part American, but all the staff speak English. We also met the charming and very cute Xavier! He too was helpful and fun to talk with! We had not planned on eating breakfast at the hotel, given the 15 euros per person cost. But when we realized that we would have a 5-10 min walk to cafes, we changed our minds. The breakfast room was lovely, on the first floor, bright and cheerful. We found the woman who served us to be quite nice, very attentive, prompt in bringing our food, and all buffet items were kept filled. We also had a young man one day, who also was attentive and delightful. So I would have to disagree with the negative remarks about the breakfast. I think for the substantial breakfast we ate each day, it would have cost just as much outside the hotel as in. I guess if you were only having coffee and a croissant, then a caf\u00c3\u00a9 would be cheaper. The lobby/lounge area was also charming. A small bar appeared well stocked & a popular cocktail spot. Off the lobby is the library with fireplace and computer for guests use. There is a fitness room in the basement as well. We found the hotel was about a 10 min walk though to subway stops (Saint Sulpice, Saint Germain, Rennes) and to more populated streets of shops & cafes. Immediately around the hotel are the post office, the Senat building, and the narrow side street with residences and a couple of restaurants. The Luxembourg gardens are across the street, with an entrance a few feet down the street. I have indicated I will be happy to answer any email questions anyone has about this hotel.

Also, one of the shower handles broke off and couldn't be fixed for a few days because it was a weekend. However, these issues were overshadowed by the delights we found around every corner.

We had 2 superior rooms on the third floor, one corner room with a view of the Luxembourg gardens and one room with a view of the Rue Servandoni, which is a small side steeet. Both rooms were relatively noisy because of the very busy Rue Vaugirard, even the room on the side street. We all used earplugs, so it did not bother us. The rooms were wonderfully apointed. Very tastful decoration, very French. We absolutely loved our rooms. Inside the hotel was very quiet. It really felt like home to us. The staff bend over backwards to make your stay memorable. Really outstanding hospitality. One exeption was the rude woman at breakfast. We waited over half an hour for our first coffee and then complained at the front desk because she had disappeared and no other staff member was to be found in the breakfast area. After she returned and was made aware of our complaint she became very rude and we also did not get our eggs any more. The lady at the front desk was very apologetic and took the breakfast off our bill. We then decided to go out for breakfast on the remaining days. It is a pity that one woman sets a damper on an otherwise perfect hotel (there are many complaints here at tripadvisor about the breakfast service). BTW on our first morning there was a friendly young man serving the breakfast and this was really enjoyable. The location of the hotel is just perfect. The gardens are so beautiful and fun to walk in and people watch at every time of the day. The restaurants in the area are great, all in short walking distance of the hotel.

Everyone at the HLP was so helpful and polite and really made our stay special. Laurent, the bartender, was a delight. He served up champagne and great conversation when we would come back from long days of sightseeing. Veronique, Fabian, Jacques and a new trainee (young man whose name escapes me) were amazing and gladly helped us with any request we had.....be it from a restaurant recommendation to which bus to take to see the eiffel tower to stamps to helping us schedule a tour to Versailles. Our tour to Versailles was another highlight of the trip. You can probably do it on your own, but I think you get more by having a tour and learning of all the nuances of this place. The gardens and water fountains are magnificent. Water fountains run on the weekends only. Back to HLP....our room looked very french and beds and bathroom cleaned and ready for us every day we returned from a long day of touring thanks to Gretchen! One thing I miss most are the beds and pillows. They were so comfortable!!!! One tip that we were not aware of in Paris and I didn't come across in any of the travel books I purchased, have plenty of euro coins (1 and 2 euro) as metro doesn't take bills. Or purchase the ticket of ten. The coins come in handy regardless and you can break a 20 euro bill at a bank for a roll of 1 euro coins. It was a lifesaver mid trip for us. The breakfast is OK at 15 euro...it's a revenue producer at all hotels. We did this a few days but decided to walk up to the McDonald's and get an egg sandwich, coffee, etc for less.

However, they were very clean, and the bathroom (where you spend most of your time anyway) was very nice. The hotel had a nice courtyard and downstairs bar area where people seemed to enjoy a drink or so everynight. We did not eat breakfast at the hotel as there were so many other options (try Gerard Mulot down the street for pastries!!!), but the breakfast room seemed very nice. There is also a very nice looking workout room downstairs. In the past we have stayed at the Hotel d'Aubusson which we enjoyed and which has a great location as well, (which I would give 4 stars to versus 3 1/2 for the Hotel Luxembourg parc).

There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a library lounge, a bar, a fitness centre, an indoor courtyard, and a small breakfast room. There is no restaurant (but plenty of choice nearby). The staff were all pleasant and helpful and the overall experience relaxing. The breakfast is a good compromise between American and French tastes. There is a public computer and free WiFi. This hotel is a good choice for those who like their luxury understated and moderately priced for Paris. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s certainly one of the best we have used in our many visits to that city. But it is small, a place for sleeping in rather than living in and probably better for a short stay.

The interior of the rooms was spotless, with recently refurbished bathrooms, period furniture and artwork. Pillows were fairly soft and flat and beds were satisfactory by hotel standards. There was a very nice fitness room with a treadmill, a cross trainer, and a couple of other machines. This was very handy after eating so much good food. Location was excellent, just in front of the Luxembourg Gardens with staff providing good advice on nearby restaurants. On this note, it is worthwhile mentioning that hotel staff were fantastic - perhaps the best we have ever had after years of world travelling, from the unbelievably welcoming reception we received and the attendant bar staff who made lovely, albeit quite expensive drinks (12 euros for a cocktail). The best room by far was the sitting room which has a working wood fireplace, a chessboard, library and dimmed lights. The experience for our children was also excellent and we would highly rate this hotel for families based on our experiences. My parents, both 70 and quite discerning, were also very impressed with all aspects of the bar and front desk service.

I'll start out with the negatives because there were only a few main ones: the elevator was broken and there really isn't a view of the park. The elevator broke after our first night, so we would come home from a day sweltering in Paris to another few flights of stairs we had to climb. That sucked, but I understand that it was just bad luck. We left before it was fixed. When I booked the room, I expected to have a view over the park. I probably should have researched more, because you get a view of the government building across the street, huge trees and part of a clay tennis court. No big deal, but just adjust your expectations accordingly. You will not be overlooking magnificent gardens. The hotel is narrow, so I can't imagine the view is any different from any other room streetside. The shower was nice, with both a handheld and a rainshower head. I noticed that for some reason the water was a lot hotter in the handheld, so I didn't use it, but I'm a wuss about hot water, so most people would be fine. The toiletries were scented with a fairly masculine scent: Chrome by Azzaro. My husband didn't like the breakfast, but it was about the same as most European breakfasts. If you like yogurt or cereal you'll be fine. I was happy with it. Usually three or four different croissants and rolls, two different loaves of bread for cutting your toast (please use the napkin provided to hold the loaf so your icky fingers don't get all over it! I saw a typical \"ugly American\" couple holding the bread with their bare hands and I was very grateful I'd already cut my slice off). They have fresh fruit and a variety of teas plus coffee. You can order American breakfast food a la carte, for an additional fee. The pillows kinda sucked and it took us a couple nights to get them just right, but they are your standard down pillows, just not as stuffed as others we've encountered. The bed was your typical European firm bed. Adequate. The room had a nice closet with some shelving, and plenty of drawer space. A desk for writing too. The room was a small but well planned space. We liked this hotel and would stay there again. The staff was very nice and accommodating, and they have a killer gym for a hotel of this size (though I'll admit I was too tired from walking all day to use it, they had one of those cool Power Plates.) The decor is charming and makes you feel very much like you're in an old, elegant home in Paris. You have to walk a little to get to the metro (we used St Sulpice most of the time) but it's not bad at all and there are plenty of restaurants within walking distance. Check out \"Aux 2 Olivers:\" the best meal in two weeks of traveling Europe. The proximity to the Luxembourg Gardens was a big plus for me. They close fairly early in the evening, so be mindful of the time. We were very grateful for the quiet location when we discovered they were having a city-wide music festival on the 21st. We went out walking into crowds of people near the Pantheon where bands were set up in the street blasting all kinds of music. Very fun! But when you're tired and want to go to bed, you wouldn't want your hotel above that, so we were happy that ours was in a quiet location. A couple we met on a Segway tour (go! it's totally fun!) had their hotel right above one of the bands set up and they didn't stop playing until 5 am! There is no room service, but they have some arrangement for take out from what I can tell. There is no iron in the room, but when we asked to have a couple of shirts ironed, they did it for free and with a fairly good turn around time, so that was nice.

The Hotel is in a lovely spot in the fantastic St-Germain-des-Pres area, really convenient to walking to many major attractions like the Louvre and Notre Dame. Although it is opposite the Jardin du Luxembourg the Hotel does not really have a view of it. Having said this, the hotel is beautiful and we were lucky enough to have room overlooking rue Servandoni which is a quiet side street. Our room was beautiful with Louis XV furnishings and a large king bed which was very comfortable. The bathroom was also a good size, marble throughout with a bath and shower over which was very good. The housekeeping was excellent, everything was very clean and the rooms were cleaned and replenished twice a day with fresh towels and facecloths. No tea and coffee making facilities, but the bar downstairs served good coffee, and you do get a mini bar. The reception area, bar and lounge were similarly beautiful, although not large areas they were very up market with beautiful furnishings and very peaceful. The reception staff were helpful, efficient, friendly and most of them spoke great English. They arranged our trip to the Moulin Rouge (highly recommended \u00e2\u20ac\u201c fantastic experience) for us. I had also sent several e-mails to them prior to arrival and they were very helpful and replied promptly each time. Breakfast was wonderful. Fresh fruit, cereals, juices, bread, ham, cheese, croissants, butter, jam, pastries and lots of wonderful coffee or tea. The croissants were fantastic and came from the wonderful patisserie Gerard Mulot just round the corner. All set in a lovely breakfast room and very friendly breakfast team. For a treat visit Gerard Mulot patisserie and try one (or more!) of their wonderful cakes, you won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be disappointed - they are a work of art. If you leave the Hotel on rue de Vaugirard and turn left you will walk past a lovely French restaurant called Aux 2 Oliviers, which we highly recommend for a wonderful meal (not too pricey) and within short (2 min) stroll from the hotel. There are lots of great places to eat in the area but reservations are probably wise if you really want to go to a particular place. We found some lovely little bistro\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in the evenings (some of them open before 7pm), where we could curl up in the corner with a bottle of red wine and talk the night away, just like the Parisians. The St Sulpice metro is right by the hotel (at the end of rue Servandoni). The trains are quick and efficient and recommended, especially the metro. You can whiz around the city in no time. We flew in from Southampton airport to CDG and took the RER to Luxembourg Parc. We were fine as only had hand luggage, but it would be a trek if you had many cases. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a long way down to the RER station at the airport, trains can be crowded and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a short walk across the park to the hotel. Lovely in the sun, we enjoyed it! I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think we could have asked for more. It is the perfect place to enjoy Paris from, with good size rooms, comfortable, elegant and good value for money.

Lured by the prospect of a view of Luxembourg Garden, I booked a standard room (all with views overlooking the gardens, according to their web site). Once there, I saw that the view consists of the back of the Senate building and some very tall trees. Possibly the rooms on the top floors might see something of more interest, but the only standard room then available, on the first floor above ground level, offered not much besides traffic noise, from two directions. Just as well, then, that the hotel had upgraded us to a superior room, on the same level but facing the picturesque side street, with minor traffic noise that was tolerable except for the morning trash collection. But never mind all that. Our stay was pleasant from start to finish, beginning with the staff's cordiality during the discussion and inspection of room alternatives. (Recommendation: Ask for a high floor room when you make your reservation.) Our superior room was large for Paris, and beautifully traditionally furnished. The bathroom had classic marble styling but a modern tub/shower with a constant temperature control that really worked, and separate faucets for the rainforest shower and the telephone showerhead. We were quite happy with the selection of delicious fresh French breads and rolls, one of the delights of morning in Paris, so we never tried to order an egg dish for an extra couple of euro. Others have noted that the selection doesn't compare to an international hotel buffet, but it was fine for us. The weekend server provided French cafe au lait, but the weekday lady, who spoke little English, brought us weaker American style coffee even when asked for cafe au lait. The location, across from the gardens and near many restaurants, was fine for dining, great for strolling in the gardens, and a pleasant five minutes walk to the student quarter and fifteen to the touristy area near the Seine. So we got to enjoy restaurants frequented by locals, in a very nice neighborhood, with no t-shirt shops or tourist trap restaurants (but an easy walk to them if desired).

I was also looking at the hotel's website while speaking on the phone with a member of staff. Unfortunately (and as expected), there was only one double bedroom left (the cheapest one). Although it looked very nice on the website, the room was apparently facing the Luxembourg Park, and as a consequence the main street (rue de Vaugirard). Feeling that I was slightly hesitant on the phone, the attendant kindly assured me that this last room was on the 4th floor, thus it was not noisy. I then decided to go for it. On D-day (a Saturday), we arrived with my wife around 5.30pm at the hotel. But...big surprise: the room we were offered was on the first floor, and this was apparently the only one left! The room (FYI number 16) was quite tiny, VERY noisy (due to the rather heavy traffic on the main street), and we could feel that people walking on the sidewalks could see everything in the room, as it was on the 1st floor with 'low' windows. The condition of the room was mainly 'kind-of ok', but when looking closely at the furniture, small details were showing that all of it was a bit worn out. Overall, this was far from reflecting the price I was being asked for, and above all this was not the room I had initially booked! I told the attendant (who was not the same one I spoke with on the phone a few days before) that I had specifically booked by phone a bedroom on the 4th floor. The attendant did not see any notes of this requirement on his booking schedule (!?), and admitted that the same room on the 4th floor had been taken by other people who had arrived earlier than us on the same day!!! Very surprising room management from a 4-star hotel, don't you think? Seeing that we were rather disappointed by what we ended up with, the understanding attendant decided as a gesture to reduce the rate by 20%. However, with my wife we refused this offer, as we thought that even a cheaper rate will not help us forget a sleepless night in a noisy room (we speak from experience). Hence about 10mn after checking in, we left the room and told the attendant that finally we did not want to stay. We explained that there was clearly a mistake made on their side: the staff should not have given our room to somebody else, only because these people arrived first. He reluctantly agreed not to charge me for the night as I obviously had given my credit card by phone. We finally went to another hotel where we stayed in before (Mercure, Accor group). For exactly the same price, we had an Executive Room (very quiet, twice the size of the room at the Luxembourg Parc) with a fantastic breakfast included. Anyway, as a recap: - Make sure (if you can afford it) to book a room NOT facing the street, - If you have specific requirements while booking, make sure that the staff take them into account, - Just in case, don't check in too late in the afternoon...", "Date": "April 15, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fleet", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel, we recommend you at all\u201d", "Author": "Coolmark", "ReviewID": "UR15006784", "Content": "Hello! we went to Luxembourg Parc hotel last week and, as usually we travel we like to share our good and bad experiences in the hotels we are, we want to make a good review of this hotel.

The rooms are brilliant, tastefully decorated with a bright, clean bathrooms - only minor gripes and certainly this is something the hotel can't help, is that our room was on the narrow cobbled street down the side of the hotel, directly opposite a small Kiwi restaurant, no trouble with the restaurant itself, it's just that with the new smoking ban which seems to be sweeping across Europe, people now congregate outside of bars, hotels, restaurants etc to have a sly fag - and of course have a chat whilst having a few puffs. Perhaps because the street itself was so narrow and quiet the chat and laughter tended to echo and kept us awake for a couple of the nights until gone one in the morning - like I said, not a fault of the hotel but an unforeseen side effect of the smoke ban I guess. The only other gripe, and again, not serious, as to be honest didn't expect much more from a European hotel, is the average breakfast - it's not cheap so would expect a bit more than the bog standard euro breakfast of rolls, pastries, cold meats and cheese - ok there was fruit salad and yogurts but that's about it, you have to pay extra again for eggs of any sort - and to be honest the service wasn't brilliant as one morning there was no meats and cheese left which was no big deal as I didn't want any, but on the second day I had to ask for fruit salad as that wasn't available either - can't say the service was with a smile either - but then again it's Paris and if you don't get one or two Gallic shrugs and looks of disdain you're not experiencing the real Paris! What really ticks all the boxes though for this hotel has got to be the location, can't think of any where else in Paris which has so many great bars and restaurants on its doorstep - we travelled outside of the area for a couple of meals on the evenings (one to the Eiffel tower) and to be honest, wish we hadn't, as everything you could possibly want for a great night out is within walking distance - Latin Quarter, St Germain and Luxembourg Parc all mingle into one trendy area. It's also a doddle to get to the hotel from Charles de Gaulle airport - line B of the REF network takes about 45 minutes and deliveries you within a 10 minute walk of the hotel for just over 8 euros - and talk about regular, I think there were about 3 in a half hour period, and that was a Sunday - First Great Western (a poor excuse for a rail network in the UK) eat your heart out! Likewise there are 4 metro stations all within walking distance which will take you all over Paris for a fraction of the cost of City travel in the UK, again incredibly fast, safe and clean - makes the London underground look like it was built in the dark ages.", "Date": "March 24, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "In limbo", "Title": "\u201cWhat warmth\u201d", "Author": "largerthanlife-06", "ReviewID": "UR14430479", "Content": "We were staying in Paris for four days, and I had been recommended this hotel by fried who stayed last year.

The room's decor was lovely and the room was comfortable but small. It must have been a bit of a squeeze for the owners to fit all the lovely furniture into such a confined space. Our room had a desk and chair, 2 arm chairs and a side table, a bureau (with the tv, mini bar etc) and a good sized closet. Luckily the room had enough hooks and cupboard space to enable us to put most of our gear away. The 2 beds pushed together worked fine as they had a common bed base. The little entry hall area helped create some space too. The bathroom was well appointed and had its own window that looked out to the hotel's internal courtyard. Again, there was enough storage in the bathroom. The shower (in bath) was excellent and the fluffy white towels were appreciated. Even though our room faced the street we found it pretty quiet. The hotel's internal courtyard looked very pleasant and must be a nice place to sit in summer. We did though make use of the hotel's bar and library on the ground floor. The library had a computer with internet access provided free of charge. There was also wi-fi internet access available on the ground floor for no charge but I had some difficulty getting a reliable connection and ended up subsribing to Orange wi-fi (which I could also use in the hotel's communal areas). The hotel's staff were all friendly and helpful. The hotel's location is fairly central. It took us about 7 min to walk to the Odeon metro stop. Whilst there weren't that many cafes and restaurants right on the hotel's doorstep they were many located a little more towards Blvd St Germain. We tended to eat breakfast in nearby cafes but we did enjoy the hotel breakfast on our last morning.

Having stayed at other 4 and 5 star hotels in Madrid (the Ritz, for example) and Rome (an overpriced, horrible hotel) -- we definitely thought HTP provided a good value for a high quality accommodation. What is great about this hotel? The rooms are beautiful...absolutely beautiful, well-maintained, and offer lovely details. For example, our Executive Room (which is picture at their site, www.hotelluxparc.com ) still retained much of the original wood-beamed ceiling. It was astonishing to look at it looking up from the bed as the ancient timbers showed a distressed past (termite damage), but they were perfectly restored and integrated into modern, clean stucco ceiling. Simultaneously, you could appreciate the age and hand-crafted nature of building, as well as enjoy the modern conveniences of a perfectly functioning climate control and a clean marble bathroom. The bed's decorative duvet cover was clean and crisp -- and it was not a polyester cloth with a print, but actually a woven cover with embroidery. The walls were handsomely decorated with tasteful art work as if the room were inside a home that had slowly accumulated art treasures from travel. The parquet wood floors were well cared for and dust free. What could be improved? The morning breakfast buffet, as others have noted, was relatively spartan given the price 15 euros per person. But, it is ideal for two occasions. The first morning after your long flight over the Atlantic Ocean from the USA and the last morning before you depart. It provides a dependable, substantive meal in a quiet dining room. And the staff? Almost all of the desk staff are native British English speakers. They are very sweet and as attentive as you wish them to be. They never thrust themselves at you, but rather readily greet you with a Bonjour and quickly pickup on if you need something or simply provide you with a generous smile and send you on your way to enjoy the city. As the weather was a bit cold and rainy during our stay -- they also made sure to offer us the use of their hotel umbrellas. Also, when I originally planned our trip I had accidently booked the wrong dates. This was totally my fault, but after a quick email exchange with the staff before our arrival into Paris -- they efficiently made the booking changes and notified me via email. And, Sara, the front desk lady that assisted me with the booking change, knew who I was when we checked in the first day. I was both touched and pleased to know that she remembered. One more item, there was a mix-up on the mini-bar tab. We did not consume anything from the mini-bar, but the cleaning staff had noted we had drank two beverages. Again, Sara did not even hesitate and took us at our word and did not charge us for these beverages. Sara, and her colleagues, are the ideal hotel staff that all travelers hope for -- attentive, kind, trusting, and friendly. I promise you won't be disappointed. We couldn't speak more highly of the Hotel Luxembourg Parc. We cannot wait for an excuse to stay there again. Lastly, do know that the staff at Hotel Luxembourg Parc is very attentive to reviews at Tripadvisor. After checking out, we mentioned that we had located them through Tripadivsor and again, Sara, noted they were disappointed to learn that a prior traveller had been unhappy with their stay. If you look for that review -- you will see it -- the one relating to an open or unlocked door for three days. Sara very quickly brought up this bad review, which surprised me. I hadn't read it as had been written during our stay at the hotel. She noted that the hotel had not been aware of the issue that the traveller recorded in their review. Further, she was disappointed that the hotel did not know about the problem until after the fact. Her honesty was astonishing because it demonstrated that the staff was (1) genuinely interested in following up on guest reviews and (2) desired to correct the situation.

The hotel is small but completely charming, well-decorated, comfortable and elegant The staff are always at your disposal, very efficient, friendly, and knowledgeable. They go out of their way and treat you as though you were a guest in their own home. With only 23 rooms, a small bar in the reception area, a library with free computer use, a small breakfast room on the park, and an exercise room in the basement, the feeling is more like being in a home or inn. There is a small but charming courtyard off of the reception area but it was too cold to sit out there. At night a light lit the fanciful sculpture onto the wall. In general, the hotel has the feeling that everything has been well-thought out but not overdone. We had an executive room on the third floor which was as nice as its photo. It had two large windows opening onto a small courtyard, an armoir area, a desk and sitting chair. The room was decent size and in very good shape. There are lovely details everywhere including the marble bathroom which was a little small but still very nice. The room was very quiet and we felt we had a lot of privacy. Each floor seems to have a similar layout. Our room number was 31 and was similar in size to 21, etc. There is one room in the hotel with a balcony overlooking the park but I understand that the room is smaller. Other rooms overlooking the park or side street might be noisier. On arrival, we had a small gift of a little, cute dog with the hotel emblem. The staff knew their neighborhood well and directed us to very good restaurants including Le Petit Coeur. The neighborhood is lovely. For an urban setting, the park is tranquil and beautiful with its winding paths, Parisians relaxing with each other, interesting and varied statues, and lovely flowers. Families walk by during the day, and the area near the hotel is very chic with beautiful apartments, small interesting shops and varued restaurants. It is a short walk to Saint Sulplice and the Cafes (Deux Magot etc), It is not far to the Seine, the Orsay, the Louvres, Notre Dame and movie theaters. There are many lovely boutiques in the area including some of the big names like Yves St Laurent.

The Library is cosy to return to after a day out and about, to sit back relax and enjoy a coffee or something stronger ! Fab location and the staff will point you in the direction of a great choice of restaurants nearby.

The rooms are beautifully appointed; quite large by Paris standards and the views are captivating. We became a bit better acquainted with the hotel staff on this visit. Two of them deserve special mention: Fabienne and Sophia. Fabienne has been with the hotel for several years. She is the quintessential Parisienne. She knows all the corners of the city and had no hesitation recommending places to eat and visit. She happily spoke with us in (perfect) English and indulged me while i practiced my french. Sophia is brand new to the hotel. A young woman from Sweden who is in Paris to perfect her french, Sophia was a most willing and attentive server at the hotel. She was very sweet and obliging with every request. Again, her english was perfect (we thought she was a Canadian) and she happily moved from french to english.

We booked a deluxue room which was superb, I think maybe the cheaper rooms are smaller but equally as sumptuous. There is an endless supply of fresh towels etc. It is very central and we walked all over paris from here, I would book a room over the courtyard as they are very quiet and I am not sure how busy the road is at night. All rooms have air con and I would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel to anyone who wanted a nice Paris break. Do check the price of drinks at the bar before ordering though as they have some very expensive cognacs wich we ordered and consumed before we were told the price! They were however very good so that is merely an advisory note for those on a budget!

It is a short and interesting stroll to Boulevard St. Germain along boutique-lined streets. The Odeon Metro line is 5 minutes away and connects to all points of the city via Chatelet or Montparnasse. There is a wonderful neighborhood bakery near St. Sulpice, on the corner of Rue Mabillon and Guisarde, which serves freshly baked breads and pastries if you want to pass on the expensive breakfast at the hotel. For other daily supplies there is a supermarket on Rue de Seine, just beyond Boulevard St. Germain. The front desk staff speak English and are helpful recommending restaurants, local attractions and arranging transportation. By all means, take time to walk around the Gardens across the street and see the famous fountain in which children sail rented sailboats a la Madeleine. St. Sulpice, currently undergoing exterior renovation, is at the end of the cobbled alley that borders the hotel. Rooms are beautifully decorated and functionally outfitted. Double/triple glazed windows keep street noise to a minimum. The marble baths have generous counter space and excellent lighting. The interior designers have done a magnificent job of creating environments that are elegant but comfortable; unique prints and paintings (some artfully illuminated), high quality fabrics, wood floors with Persian carpets and comfortable furniture make a stay here pleasantly homey. There was no iron or ironing board provided, although there was same day laundry service (in by 10am, back by 8pm).

Altogether it was a great trip and we will likely stay at the Luxembourg-Parc again in the future. Many positives for this hotel. Firstly, the location is great, right across from the Jardins Luxembourg and within easy walking distance of three metro lines and at least one RER station.(which goes directly to the Charles de Gaulle airport). Many of the sites on the left bank are within a 5-10 minute walk including Rue St-Michel, and even Notre-Dame. The hotel is also quite attractive. Our room, which I believe was an upgrade on the basic room, was not huge, but was very attractive and comformtable. The bathroom was very nice and roomy by European standards. The one slight downside was the service. When booking, we had asked for, and been told we would get, a room not facing rue Vaugirard (which is quite busy/noisy). We ended up getting a room right on that street and were told that we could not switch rooms due to the hotel being fully booked. Apart from that, the front desk service was just OK, with some of the attendants very helpul and others a little less so (for issues such as restaurant recommendations and taxis).
