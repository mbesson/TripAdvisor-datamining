There really wasn't a choice about it as the entire the entire wedding party & guests ended up staying at La Cima. We hoped for the best. Here is my review: Check-in: After a long flight to Aguadilla & EXPENSIVE cab ride ($35 for literally a 2 mile ride) we were greeted by a front desk person who spoke NO english. He couldn't make our party of 5 extra keys, and there was no one to help us bring bags to our room. We reserved the 2-bedroom apartment for our group of 5. Ahead of time we requested a cot for the 5th person. When we got there - no cot. Night 1 the extra person had to sleep on the couch. There weren't even extra pillows or blankets - and the guy at the front desk was unable to find us any. (When we went to talk to the english speaking front desk clerk the next day she tried charging us $15 extra per day for the cot - luckily I had my confirmation letter stating that there was no extra charge.) The living area of the apartment was alright, old furniture, but decent in size. There was a full kitchen, but of course no pots or pans. The bathroom had no fixutres, just bare bulbs hanging over the mirror. Moldy shower/floor (other wedding guests actually went out and bought their own cleaning supplies to clean their bathrooms!!), no shelf for toiletries, 1 roll of toilet paper (which is all were were ever given on any day), the carpets were FILTHY - and we never saw a maid with a vacuum our entire stay. They only used mops & brooms. HOW do you clean carpet without a vaccuum. YUCK. The door to the back patio got stuck twice (and the knob had to be removed by maintenance). Not too big of a problem since we only used the patio to hang wet suits since the table & chairs were so filthy, and who wants to sit on a patio surrounded by barbed wire (seriously). The pool area is decent. Except that there are only 5 lounge chairs (3 of which are broken & missing slats). Every day the pool area was PACKED with screaming Puerto Rican kids (not sure if they were local or guests) - and it's a TINY pool (backyard sized). The jacuzzi was more of a whirlpool - not warm at all. Good luck finding a pool towel. Apparently you have to know to go to the laundry room and ask housekeeping for a pool towel. Why wouldn't they put the pool towels near the pool? The website says that La Cima has a pool w/BBQ area. The BBQ area is across the parking lot from the pool area. There is one stone table, a dirty charcoal grille, and a bar. Our entire stay the bar had a dirty rolled up carpet laying on top of it. It's also beside the \"game room\" which is chain locked shut. The website says that La Cima has 2 air-conditioned restaurants on-site. In reality - there is NO restaurant on site at all. It is closed. So is the bar or \"cocktail lounge\" they claim to have. The \"exercise facility\" had 1 weight bench and was not airconditioned. The complimentary business center with internet access - wasn't working. In order to get to a beach you will need to rent a car. The hotel is a good 7 minute drive to a beach (although once you get there, the beaches are definitely worth it). I felt the need to write an honest review - because I was definitely duped by reviews written before me.

La Cima was a delightful place to spend a few days. It is close to some great beaches and has a great pool area itself. The staff made us feel welcome and the rooms were very clean. For the money, you cant beat it! Make sure you go horse back riding nearby!

The stay has been home away from home. Started in room 301, great studio for a long stay, but got tired of the stairs and carrying my computer and papers up and down everyday and asked to be moved. I packed they moved me to 102 in front of the Pools and jacuzzi, love the sound of the waterfall at night. The 2 restaurants have great food and are very accomodating with special requests of things not on the menu. Got to be on a first name basis with the Fantastic Staff, from Frankie, Gladys, Lucy and even the cheff at the Nomada Rest. Rooms and grounds very clean. It is not the RITZ but it is sure a nice place to stay!!! Thumbs Up from me.

I was in Room 103, which is by the pool. The room was very clean on arrival, and housekeeping was there every day to straighten it up. The room was quite large and had a very comfortable king-size bed, a sofa/sitting area, microwave, refrigerator, coffee-maker with daily refills of coffee, in-room safe, hairdryer, a liquid soap and shampoo dispenser in the shower, and an iron/ironing board. The cable TV worked perfectly, and the water was VERY hot in the large shower. On the property is a cocktail lounge which is open until midnight, a Chinese Restaurant, and a Continental restaurant, which is also open for breakfast. Breakfast was around $6.00, and the dinners ranged from $7.00--$16.00. The food was quite good, and any special requests were not a problem. There is also an exercise room, and game room for guests to use. The staff was extremely friendly, and helpful in planning day trips. For $85.00 a night, this hotel is a great value--and location wise, you can't beat it. 10 minutes to anywhere in town.

Next day we came to front desk to ask for the pool purses and after waiting there for about 20 minutes my wife an I asked very gently if there were a problem on giving us the purses. The manager came out from his office yelling at us and threatening with his hands(almost hit us) with a complete lack of respect attitude accusing us of trying to use the pool without a reservation. He was asking me to pay a ridiculous high additional amount for my 10 months old infant child. After discussion the trip was ruined . He apologized with my wifes family for his attitude. Anyway the pool had cigarette smell and a lot of drunk people drinking inside it and throwing ice. I don't recommend you to stay here.
