One can tell that the building has been renewed recently, but the furnitures is the old (and dirty) one. Cleaning is really something unknown there, breakfast leaves something to be desired, and the rooms on first floor are noisy. But the worst was the bathroom, with a very bad smell (like drain) and not working properly or at all. Avoid it unless you're desperate, and in any case bring with you something to clean and disinfect the place.", "Date": "May 30, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR807531068", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "d71"}, {"Content": "B As my first time in Europe, I was under the misconception that Bed and Breakfast would in fact include a breakfast. Also looking at the website that stated linens included meant that you had to specificly ask for towels that it promised with your room. This would have been fine if we had been able to ask the mananger of Alex House for them, however he was convinently gone most of the time. This made me as a visitor uneasy, specailly when we were told that we were lucky to have caught him to check in. Another uneasy moment was when he needed to be paid that night, leaving as soon as he had our cash. The next morning, the only other encounter we had with him, was when he told us of the check out time which was immedately. The room that we immedately had to leave he said had to be cleaned for the next group due to arrive, this was a hard statement to believe because just the night before we had been told the same thing. It was however apparent that he did not clean it because in the shower, that early the previous day had held cleaning products, a used razor was found.", "Date": "Jun 29, 2004", "ReviewID": "UR351424861", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Buon albergo ed ottima...   showReview(21364980, 'full');", "Date": "Oct 23, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR330224231", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Hotel Alex...Al di sopra della sufficenza!   showReview(21020163, 'full');", "Date": "Oct 20, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR457198863", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "BurghyRome"}, {"Content": "Ottimo hotel.
