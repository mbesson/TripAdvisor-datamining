My expectations were really low due to reviews. There were lots of complaints about crappy, tiny rooms with small or no windows at all and unfriendly staff. I wondered if I had come to a different hotel.. I payed about 20-30 euros per night, and I think I got really acceptable value for the money. The reception, breakfast room and my room were neat. They gave me a double room, although I was traveling alone. It was more spacious than e.g. Finnish double rooms tend to be. Ok, there were some moldy spots on the roof of the bathroom, but they didn't bother me as otherwise I was happy with the room, and I didn't stay very long. There were also a pretty painting and beautifully framed, big mirror in the room. The view was to the backyard. Soundproof was pretty bad, that was a bit of a problem as the room was in the ground floor. They cleaned every day, brought clean towels etc. The staff were really friendly, young and perky. They didn't allow my friend to come to the room, but the reason was very understandable. Otherwise they were hospitable, my friend got to use the Internet and so on. Breakfast was okay, similar stuff I'd have at home. The breakfast room was peaceful, not very many other guests there. I was surprised that there were so many elder people at that time. (My friend stayed in another hotel and it was full of very young people.) Location is good, the area looks very wealthy and neat. Museums and shopping streets are close. For a budget meal we had to walk a bit further. I felt safe when I walked back to the hotel at night. The bus to the airport stops nearby, next to the Rijksmuseum :).", "Date": "April 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Idaho", "Title": "\u201cLoved the location\u201d", "Author": "t_w_s_d", "ReviewID": "UR128057824", "Content": "I thought for the amount of money I paid for this room (granted, it was a busy time of year) I would get more than a tiny closet in the basement of the building.

Both were en suite, and the shower was powerful. The only down side was one of the night porters, who was very grumpy, but as we didn't need to have too much to do with him everything was fine. The hotel is ideally positioned for the Leidesplein, a short walk away, and also Museumplein, both very close. The rooms were cleaned everyday, and towels changed.

However upon entry we were plesantly surprised with the rustique tables, wooden floors and general ambiance. We arrived a few hours before checking and so wanted to sore our suitcases. After being issued with the fence post key, my friend kindly took my suitase (being a fine blonde) down the stairs of death and into the dungeon basement, ignoring the suspicious smells. Having stored our luggage we went out to enjoy the pleasures of the city. We returned to check in and were informed that although we had booked two rooms together we were in fact not going to be neighbours. I was condemmed to the top floor of the left hand side of receiption and my friends the right. Im no bear grylls, but even my friend who's a fireman was out of breath climbing the stairs to hell. Why didnt i take the lift you ask- because they dont have one. Oh and the floors arent linked so to visit my friends room i had to walk all the way down and all the way up again. May i recommend this place as a low class fat camp. Having reached the summit we opended the gateway to hell! It soon became apparent there was more DNA in these rooms than the brothels in Amsterdam! Mine came with an interesting patch, i think they must have moved the body a few hours before. I honestly dont know what it was but im sure it hand life in in. My friend saw the upside, 'oh at least youve got a nice big wardrobe' he said. He couldnt have be more wrong... the wardrobe was the bathroom/wetroom/beeding ground for lime disease.. Distraught my friend departed to discover the likes of his room. The only luxuary was the two inch window. It opened but not enought to abort the flithly smell of the DNA in the room. Safety is clearly very important here. My fireman friend soon noticed that a large stripy sock had been placed over the only fire/smoke detection in the room. Stay here at your own peril. We hired bikes, we went out, partied and enjoyed the city spending nd much time away from armageddon as we could. Our good mood was quickly squashed as soon as we returned to the hotel.We had to shower in the dark as the bulb went, got eletrocuted by the light switch and were constantly examining the red bites over out bodies. Concerns for our health growing by the hour we finally escaped but not unscathed. We are still discusing the whole experience one month later and are all still very much emotionally affected.

The room is right next to reception, the stairs, and the breakfast area, getting all the possible noise, screaming, etc.. At 4:30 am, someone decided to sing a whole song, to the top of his lungs, and no one in recption seem to see it fit to stop him. In a minor note, the TV in the room was missing all but one of the buttons. To make things better the light switch for the room tripped throughout the night (apparently it happened in several rooms) and we were left in pitch black to find the door, or the bathroom (as there was no source of light whatsoever: no windows). The single beds were tiny, and wobbly, making them unconfortable to sleep in. In general, location & customer service are the only redeeming features of a horrible sleeping experience.

First of all I stayed in an \"economy\" room as I usually do when traveling, I was not expecting anything more than a simple bathroom and enough room to sleep. Upon arrival we were put in a tiny room in the musty basement, no big deal I've slept in worse places and I was there to see the city anyway not the hotel. After spending a nice evening in the city, we returned to our room to sleep. Right away my Fiance noticed stains on the sheets resembling \"bodily fluids\". After entering the bathroom I was overcome with a putrid smell coming from what appeared to be a pump to pump toilet and shower waste out of the basement. It was late so we slept on top of the blankets using our extra clothes to keep warm. Needless to say the next morning we decided to check out, and the hotel charged me for 2 nights stay which I had originally planned on. After talking with the manager the 1st time she had informed me that she would not give me a refund for the night I DID NOT even stay. but she would look into it and call me back. I was more than happy to pay for the night I stayed but didn't feel it was fair to be charged for the second night even though I left early due to the dismal conditions of this hotel. After not receiving a call-back I decided to give the manager a ring back and she told me \"you booked a budget room, you are obviously poor and are lying just to get your money back\". Needless to say I was appalled as I had never been treated this way, after all I was not trying to get money back for the night I had stayed, just for the night I hadn't.

It was a spur of the moment decision to visit Amsterdam. We were given the name of this property by a different Quentin hotel whose clerk said all of Amsterdam was booked ( we had walked into several hotels) but she said this one might have a budget room available. We walked over as it was nearby and were shown the room which was at the front overlooking the street. It was very simple, and tiny, but clean and on a quiet street and very well located. Really, if you think about it, all one does in a hotel is go to sleep and wash up as you leave for breakfast and don't return, usually, till after dinner. While we are a young senior couple, this hotel would probably be better suited to younger folks or seniors who just want a basic room. If you want extra amenities and decor and ambience, the England isn't for you. If I remember correctly, soap wasn't provided but I'd packed a small hotel bar I had for just such a possibility anywhere we went. The bathroom was clean too. Again, tiny and minimalist but all that is needed is a toilet, sink and shower. The price was very fair, around 80 Euros I think. This in August in the height of tourist season. And Amsterdam was just packed with tourists, a zoo actually. So no surprise everything in budget range was booked. We had a room only one floor up and had no problems with the stairs, even my husband whose knees don't like stairs. Bed and pillows were great. Not too soft, not too hard. We didn't buy the breakfast as the desk clerk told us off the record that for about 1 E more than what is charged by the hotel we could get a more authentic Dutch breakfast around the Leidesplein or elsewhere.

Situated between the lively Leiseplein and the tranquil Museumplein, QE is well-located for easy access to all of Amsterdam\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s major attractions, but enjoys a peaceful setting in a quiet side-street. Approximate walking distances: Vondelpark = 1 minute Leidseplein (cafes, bars & restaurants) = 90 seconds Van Gogh Museum (& Museumplein) = 3 minutes Singel = 5 minutes Annfrankhuis = 10 minutes De Wallen (Red Light District), Dam Square & Centraal Station = 10-15 minutes \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6Personally I prefer to explore Amsterdam entirely on foot, even for lengthier distances, but the QE also enjoys very close proximity to the canal and tram lines of the Leidseplein. 2) Rooms = basic, but clean. For all 3 of my stays, I have stayed in the same room (this was accidental!), which is a double ensuite situated on the ground floor. The room was spacious for its price (never more than around \u00c2\u00a340 per night, sometimes a little less), with a compact but full-equipped toilet/shower room, a double bed, 2 chairs, desk and TV. The rooms are cleaned daily. The only negative points I can think of is that it can be a little noisy at times (this doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bother me), and during one stay, the radiator was cranked up full blast, yet the heat control dial was broken so I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t turn it down \u00e2\u20ac\u201c this was a little uncomfortable, even during the blistering cold of early February 2009, but it has only happened once. 3) Hotel facilities = somewhat limited. Wi-fi was extremely temperamental, and access appeared to be turned off for most of the time. This wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t much of an issue, though, as it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s definitely more of a vacationers hotel than a business hub! You can get a half decent cup of coffee at reception for 1.50Eur, which by Amsterdam standards is really cheap. There is an abundance of free maps and city guides available for guests to pick up. Hotel staff are not overly-friendly, but again not a real concern\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6we had a minor issue with our room key card malfunctioning during one stay, but this was sorted out quickly. Hotel staff are multi-lingual with impeccable English and if you NEED them (which hopefully you won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t), I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m confident that they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be helpful and courteous.

We stayed at a room in the basement of the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hotel\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, which is really more of a hostel. It was so hot I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sleep and it took almost 24 hours to get a fan. The window was broken so that it stayed OPEN and we had to explain to them that this was unsafe and they had to fix it. The guy came down and looked at it and said: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcWe don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a key for the lock\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (which was broken anyway). Although he eventually put a screw into the wall so the window could only be opened a few inches, it took a while to make he and the (extremely unintelligent) girl at the front desk to understand why it was a problem at all. Next. The room was dirty. They claimed to clean it every day, but I KNOW they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sweep the floor and there was black dirt everywhere. The room itself looked kind of like a dingy crack-head suite from a low-budget depressing we-want-to-make-you-hate-life sort of movie. The bathroom didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have soap (it was out and never got replaced) and the shower is separated from the toilet by a flimsy curtain. One good part about the shower: it didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a problem draining since there was a large hole in the tile next to the drain! How convenient. Finally, when we asked for the manager to call us a cab, he started talking to another guest and about 10 minutes later noticed we were still sitting in the lobby. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Oh, did you want me to call you a cab?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he asked. Um, no I just said that for fun. Yes, of course I want you to call me a cab, thanks. He did and we got to the train station in a timely manner.

However me and my brother have just got back from a 3-day drinking/cultural holiday in Amsterdam and for the 40euros each we paid i thought the hotel was fine. Ok, lets get down to business.. Bad points; The general decor of the hotel is very shabby, it's not been painted or decorated in years. No bar, the only refreshments available are a very limited range of canned soft drinks from behind reception. There was a small hole in the window of around 2 inches wide. No soaps or toileteries (apart from toilet paper). No towels provided (see below). The two single beds were tiny and uncomfatable with 'rubbish' pillows and bed covers. The hotel is noisy, you can hear people upstairs, next door or whenever people are walking up and down the stairs (quite loud). The stairs are very steep and hard to walk up. AND THE GOOD POINTS; Excellent location, only a couple of minutes walk from the shops and bars. I found the staff were genarally polite and helpful.. i've had ruder at the Hilton. Towells were provided when requested. Not 'clean' but clean enough for a couple of days. Despite the noise this was due to the structure of the hotel and despite the number of young people in the hotel i didnt come across any 'rowdy' people. The thing for people to remember is this is a really cheap hotel in a really expensive city. I wouldnt want to spend a week or more here but id be quite happy to stay for cheap short breaks. It depends what your after. Even though we could both afford the Hilton we were even considering staying in a hostel as all we were using it for was sleeping. This hotel is fine.

We arrived late, cold, wet, tired, and hungry from a long international flight to be greeted by one of the most unfriendly female receptionists I have ever met. Even though our room had been booked and paid for in advance, she still demanded a credit card swipe to cover them for any damage we might cause to their room. We then asked her where we could buy a cup of coffee and something to eat. Her answer was, \"Not here, maybe 10 or 15 minutes walk down the street\". (We later found out from the day staff that you could buy a hot or cold drink and a snack from reception 24 hours a day, but at 11 pm the female receptionist was obviously not in the mood to serve us). To get to our room we had to climb up 2 flights of steep stairs with our heavy luggage (no lift, needless to say). Her only contribution was \"Bad luck, this is Amsterdam you know!\" Fair enough, but it wasn't the physical problem so much, as the 'attitude' she adopted that riled us. After struggling to get into the room, we found that the beds were not made, there were holes in the walls, the window wouldn't close, the bedlight wasn't working, the telephone wires were hanging out of the wall but there was no telephone, the TV remote control was held together with sticky tape and the bathroom stank of something which made me gag. It was also very noisy as we could hear every sound our 'neighbours' made in their rooms and in the passage ways. Towels were not changed on a regular basis and we had to lock our cases when we left the room after finding out that someone had gone through them on the first day. Breakfast was served downstairs at an extra cost, but it was highly over priced. A tray of crockery & cutlery was 'dumped' on your table after you paid and after that it was a case of help yourself to whatever was left. The variety and quality of the food was poor and the toaster only worked when it felt like it! The breakfast room was very small and often extremely crowded and noisy but the coffee was excellent. Service was non existent. We stayed there for a week and during that time I never saw any of the staff smile once. They all seemed to be unhappy and unfriendly.

Breakfast was continental and adequate as well as adequately supplied (7 euro per person). Paid 70 Euro per night for 2 people (booked through www.easytobook.com.) Room 301 - Shower, sink & toilet were very small & shower was only separated by the shower curtain so the entire floor got wet when the shower ran.

Here there was some air and I was able to sleep a bit, but there was still nowhere to hang my clothes, no instructions on how to use anything or to call out (this phone also didn't work) or get out in case of fire. There wasn't even a notice telling you how to call reception. Only one towel in this room (two handtowels and no bath towel in the previous room) and no hairdryer, etc. This hotel was convenient in its location, but my stay here definitely interfered with my work.

Upon arrival the hotel looked quite well kept on the outside and even in the reception area I thought that the hotel looked ok for a 2 star rated hotel. The chap at reception was ok. He gave directions to my room. I immediately almost smashed my neck on the stairs down to the basement.

I struggled to locate a light switch and could not believe my eyes when I switched the light on. The room was less than 1/2 the size of standard prison cell. The bathroom was filthy and there was a constant sound of what I can only assume to be a boiler 'ticking' over, hour after hour. The single bed was up against a filthy wall nicelyl decorated with squashed insects. For light you are presented with what doesn't even equate to a skylight. There 'window' was approx. a sq. foot in size and opened about 1 inch. No storage space at all for suits, shirts, etc. The window is on the street level and so you can always hear folks passing by at all hours. Worse again are those that sit on the chair outside. My window was immediately under the chair outside and I lost count of the number of times I freaked out at the shuffling of shoes, drunks, etc. Not a good place to stay for those of a nervous disposition. Only way to get over the awful conditions is to drink at least 16 cans of lager from the reception and collpase in a heap somewhere. Little point talking about the food as this was awful too. Room was full of dead spiders, especially around the window area and they only served to block the odd ray of light that managed to squeeze it's way off the street! Lack of towels and had to ask for fresh ones taht seemed as thought they has alreay been used.
