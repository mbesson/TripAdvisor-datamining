To start, the location is fantastic! You are right on the beachfront walk, close to the pier and steps away from the beach. The view from our room was also perfect \u2013 there are no buildings obstructing your view of the ocean, palm trees, and sunset. If you\u2019re looking for a good view, however, request a 2nd or 3rd floor room \u2013 the 1st floor rooms have a patio and places to sit, but have an obstructed view. They do have a parking garage underneath the hotel, though you can only park one car per room in it. They also offer a continental breakfast, which had cereal, pastries, fruit, hard boiled eggs, yogurt, waffles, toast, and bagels. The breakfast area is pretty. The pool is heated and well kept, with nice lounge chairs around it. The hot tub is also nice, and is next to the pool. Our bed was comfortable, and our room was large. It was decorated in pastel colors from the 70\u2019s (most notable in the bathroom), and could use some updated decorations. Also, the room smelled of chlorine and humidity. We did have a microwave and mini-fridge though. My one complaint, aside from the decorations, was our curtains. There was mold starting to grow on the sheer curtains, and they could have used a good washing. This was kind of gross. Overall, we enjoyed our stay, and if we got a good deal on room rates, we would stay here again.

The location is wonderful-right on the beach. Rooms were attractive, and the hotel was close to restaurants. The problems we encountered were with the room itself.

We heard the shower very loudly from the adjacent room. The adjacent bathroom must be directly behind the head board of the bed. When I called the front desk, I was told that people come off the beach and it should end soon. We went out for dinner and turned in for the night at 11pm. In the middle of the night approximately 2am, we were awakened by the sound of rushing water. This went on for 40 minutes! It was impossible to sleep. I have stayed in many hotels and motels and have never encountered water sound as loud as this establishment. The sound was loud enough to record on my iphone which I did play back for the front desk to hear. This was supposed to be more of an upscale hotel. I'm surprised they do not invest in sound insulation between the guest rooms. Fortunately, we were only booked for one night. It would have been nice if the font desk offered to change our room after our first noise complaint at 5pm, rather than shrug the complaint off and tell us to wait it out.

There were plenty of bars and restaurants in walking distance and other places of interest -- the Gaslamp district, the Zoo, etc. -- were just a short drive away.

I called several times in the next week and each time no one allowed me to speak to the housekeeping manager or the manager of the hotel.

You won't find two nicer guys who are always willing to help you with anything you need. After getting to my room, Patrick called me to be sure I liked the room and if there was anything that I needed. He has always been great at suggesting excellent places to eat in the area too. I had some people visiting for just a few hours over Labor Day weekend and there was absolutely no place to park anywhere in Pacific Beach - Sachin made sure that there was a spot for them at the hotel when they got there. How awesome is that? These guys are the best!!! All of the staff ave very accommodating and nice, but these guys are \"the bomb\"! They usually have coupons for discounts at various places in the area so ask them - they will be glad to help you out. Parking is $10.00 a nite in their own underground parking garage. Spaces are somewhat small, so larger vehicles may have a bit of a tight fit. Considering that on the weekends, and any holiday, parking in the area is nonexistent, this is a great plus to have available at this price. It is also gated so that you can feel secure when coming or going. The hotel is right on the Boardwalk which is a constant flurry of activity. Be it people walking, jogging, on roller blades, skate boards or bicycles. If you like people watching, you will have plenty of that here. The boardwalk extends for 3 miles all the way to South Mission Beach. There are many shops, restaraunts, bars, rentals and snack shops along the way. (check out the Fish Tacos at the Pacific Beach Shore club right next to the hotel!) Views from the Ocean view rooms are breathtaking to say the least. At sunset everyone along the boardwalk stops what they are doing, and watches as the sun goes down. Each balcony has a small table and 2 chairs making it a perfect cozy place to relax and just chill watching the people or the sunset. As one guest mentioned here, the water pressure in the shower is fantastic - something you don't often find in hotels. There's lots of counter space and the bathroom is roomy compared to many hotels often cramped bathrooms. People have mentioned the homeless that tend to hang out on the boardwalk near the hotel. I spend quite a bit of time walking around the boardwalk and sometimes standing near them and have never, ever been approached or ever felt threatened in any way (I am a single female). This year in fact, there were less than previous years and police presense was higher than any other year (perhaps because it was Labor Day Weekend?) I would not even consider the homeless as a factor in not choosing this hotel. The \"Beach Flies\" are quite harmless. As mentioned by others here, there is a nice flat panel TV, small microwave and mini fridge in the room. The beds are a bit soft for my taste and I'm not sure that they have changed since I started staying here, but I did not have a problem getting a good nite's sleep.

Yes there's transients on the boardwalk in front of the hotel, but I stay at the Gaslamp Hilton and have to tell them no every time I walk down the road. At least the ones in front of the hotel leave you alone as the cops make frequent trips on the boardwalk to enforce your privacy.

The continental breakfast each morning included fresh fruit, cereals, DIY Belgian waffles, pastries, bagels, muffins, juices, etc. and was excellent. The parking spaces are below the hotel, and most are too small for anything over a midsized vehicle, but it was nice to not have to waste time looking for a parking spot along the street somewhere (parking wasn't free, but was only $10/day if I recall correctly). I've read that some reviewers had problems with noise from an establishment next door, but neither I, nor a fellow traveler in a different ocean front room had any problems with noise at our rooms. That problem might be only with certain rooms (not ocean-facing). The staff was fantastic. I definitely recommend stopping by the front-desk if you have any questions at all (traffic/travel routes, local eateries, etc.). And the room itself was very clean and everything worked as it should (including the free wifi, a microwave, small dorm-sized fridge and nice-sized flat screen tv). Also, the pool and hot tub were both spotlessly clean and well-maintained. OPI seems like a good place to stay no matter what you're doing in the San Diego area. It's only about 20 minute drive to the Gaslamp/East Village/Old Town area, and about the same to the Torrey Pines area to the north. If you don't have a rental car and can't get away, you probably won't miss it, since you're literally on the beach and can walk to several good eats and shops, and there's also Belmont Park down the boardwalk (to the south) where they have carnival rides & a roller coaster. Lots of fun near OPI within walking distance. On my last day in San Diego, I took a later flight so I could find a place to go hiking and Torrey Pines SRA is just a short drive north of OPI.

If I stay again (and I want to) I'd ask for an oceanfront on the other half of the building away from the bar.

I was able to keep my car there the whole next day before I drove out of San Diego, which was really nice. The rooms got a 3 for clean. At first glance they seem ok, however I travel so much for business I've learned to tear apart and inspect certain areas for certain critters (my room was clean of signs of those) -- but there were layers upon layers of dust everywhere behind the scenes. Months of not vac'ing or getting behind the cracks or furniture. However - the room view was so awesome I could overlook it. Bed was ok, I mean, it's not a Hilton resort, and I didn't wake up sore. I did wake up with the sunshine and waves, and ate a peaceful breakfast on my patio, then wandered to north Pacific Beach and Tourmaline Beach and found awesome colorful shells for jewelry, a whole sand dollar (3.5\" in diameter!), lots of wins and epic fails watching the surfers, and some fossil hunting on the cliffs.

From check-in through checkout, the staff was very friendly, helpful and accommodating. Yes it's rather expensive, but you walk right onto the boardwalk which directly fronts the beach. We were furnished towels for the pool, spa and beach. The breakfast features do it yourself waffles, cereals, pastries, muffins, yogurts, fruit, juices, milk and coffee. The room with the two queens looked out over the alleyway and could get noisy at night. The Firehouse BAR & Grill next door really hops Friday - Sunday nights and can get quite noisy. The food at Firehouse was mediocre at best - a medium rare to go burger came extra well done and was ridiculously small. Cheesesteak sandwiches were okay.This is obviously a major hot spot and it's not for the food. The hotel is constantly maintained, just watch Todd doing cleaning and chemical balancing every morning on the pool and spa! There's outdoor showers when you enter in from the boardwalk to rinse off the major amounts of sand clinging to every part of your body. What a treat to boogie board for hours, be able to come rinse off all the stuff and then jump into the crystal clear pool and hot spa. (No wetsuits in pool please!). It's a high 3 star property. But it pays for itself in location, customer service and amenities. High speed internet is hit and miss, worked better in one room than the other and sometimes went in and out. The parking garage can be VERY cramped for anything larger than a compact car, but it seems very secure.

I walked up and down the boardwalk and I don't feel there is a better place to stay. I was on the 3rd floor with an ocean view each time. It is breathtaking at sunset. The hotel was in the process of upgrades during my last stay. My room had not been updated yet - it was in dire need of new bedding I will admit. The bed was quite uncomfortable. The TV was out dated - they were replacing them with wall mounted flat screens however. They were also painting all of the hallways - I see someone mentioned the hallways were not air conditioned - I don't spend time in the hallway, so I don't see why this would matter - I never noticed the hallways being uncomfortable. I used the pool area quite a bit to tan, and was usually the only one there. Pool area is great. I have read some reviews stating that the management and staff were rude, that the area is noisy, and there are people hanging around the hotel. I had absolutely no problems with any of the staff on either of my stays. Each one was consistently helpful, courteous - almost to a fault!, and friendly. Jay, Chanel, Patrick, Sachin and Karelia - made my stay all the more enjoyable. The hotel is on the Pacific Beach boardwalk - there is noise. There are people on the boardwalk, rollerblading, skateboarding, biking, walking and jogging from early morning to evening. The beach is also immediately off the boardwalk - what do people expect?!? For there to be no one on the beach and no one on the boardwalk? If you want quiet and solitude, stay on an island. It's Pacific Beach, it's a beach community - it is what it is. I never found the noise to be over-whelming and slept with my slider open every nite. Yes, there are a number of homeless that stay directly in front of the hotel on the boardwalk - they keep to themselves and don't bother anyone. I never saw them approach anyone at any time. They are gone by early evening. Traveling alone, I never felt afraid to be near them at any time-in fact I talked to some of them. They are harmless. T The continental breakfast changed last year and didn't offer as much as it did the year before (there were waffle makers the year before). However, there were several varieties of fresh bagels, packaged pastries, toast, butter, jelly's, cream cheese, fresh fruits, cereals, coffee, juice and milk. Just like any other continental breakfast FOR FREE. I'm just not sure what people expect. It was quite adequate. I would rather not have a full breakfast offered in lieu of keeping costs down. Again, having walked up and down the boardwalk, there are some really trashy places to stay - including the Best Western that are old, outdated, filthy and run down. Yes, there are a few nicer places like Tower 23 but the cost is also considerably higher.

We did a lot of research prior to the vacation to find a hotel that would fit our needs of location, moderate cost, pool, free breakfast, and overall value. I was having a very difficult time finding a hotel under $250/night that had decent reviews and had the important amenities we were looking for (e.g. accessible to restaurants, pool, breakfast). We were very pleased with our choice of the Ocean Park Inn and glad that we positioned our vacation in Pacific Beach. Prior to booking a room, I called the front desk to ask about the difference types of rooms and which rooms were affected by the neighboring bar's noise (from prior reviews). We booked a limited view king-bed room on the hotel website because it was the best value in our opinion (compared to the slightly more expensive partial view and most expensive ocean view); the front desk let us check out a partial view room when we arrived in case we wanted to upgrade. We stayed with our limited view room because it had better light / larger sliding glass door and was conveniently on the ground floor so we could walk right out to the hotel pool every day. There are partitions between the rooms and the pool, so we didn't feel that there was less privacy from facing the pool on the ground floor. If any rooms have less privacy it would be the ocean front rooms because the hotel is only a few feet off the boardwalk. But the views of the ocean surf are fantastic! We walked out to the Crystal Pier for amazing sunsets when we weren't enjoying the sunset at a boardwalk restaurant. The room was clean and updated, slightly unexpected after reading prior posts, with the exception of the outdated light teal bathroom (but it was very spacious and clean so we didn't mind). Our king bed was comfortable (and huge!), we had a mini-fridge to stock beer and snacks for pool time, and we were happy with the very convenient location right on the boardwalk and within walking distance of many restaurants along the Pacific Beach area. Our room had a loveseat, small closet, wardrobe, and a desk. We rented a car for our vacation so that we could explore other neighborhoods every morning until the sun came out around noon every day. Parking was very reasonable ($10) whereas it seems that every other hotel in the San Diego area charged $30/day! We enjoyed being able to drive straight down Garnet Ave (only a block or two north of Grand Ave) to Trader Joe's for getting beer, wine, and snacks. We were able to look up restaurants, directions, and lots of info on their FREE wireless internet connection, which was great and rare! Bring your laptop! The front desk was very helpful, in allowing us to ensure we had chosen the best room for us, recommending restaurants and other helpful suggestions. Jay, especially, was very friendly and helpful. After reading reviews that the front desk was staffed by teenage kids that didn't care about their customers, this was a relief. Breakfast was a little spare, but they had cereal, bagels, juice, yogurt, and (cheap) coffee. We were expecting the Belgian waffle maker previously mentioned or at least something with a little protein, so it was disappointing, but free. There was a family there telling us about all the great breakfast fare (eggs, waffles) they enjoyed during their stay there a few months earlier, so I know they have the ability to provide a more satisfying breakfast! It was apparently not busy enough that weekend to provide their superior breakfast foods. All-in-all, this was a great choice for us. Pros: free wireless internet! free breakfast until 10am, enclosed outdoor pool (for wind protection), right on boardwalk, clean/bright rooms and good value, unlimited towels for pool/beach, affordable private parking, friendly employees, and great location in Pacific Beach neighborhood to ocean and nearby restaurants (see other TripAdvisor reviews: try the Green Flash and the Fishery, avoid Gringos Cantina)... Cons: breakfast a little minimal, hot tub turns off at 10pm, can be noisy but only if in a room facing bar behind the hotel (ask front desk), no onsite restaurant but they offer room service from the neighboring bar & grill (Firehouse?)...", "Date": "June 23, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "1", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "vb", "Title": "\u201cmixed feelings\u201d", "Author": "rewyanc", "ReviewID": "UR30513759", "Content": "THis place is in a goiod location if you want to be on the boardwalk and next to the beach.

The BAD: Unfortunately, we had a room facing the Firestation bar (I think that's the name) directly next door to the hotel. The music was SO loud and people were partying and screaming until 2 or 3am. It sounded like it was right outside our window. There was NO way to sleep through the night. We found out the following night that ONLY the rooms facing this bar get the interruption. So if you're staying there, opt for a room away from that section and get a quiet sleep. The UGLY: I called the front desk at midnight to ask when the music would stop - they said 1:30 am. It went later than this. The hotel did not offer me to switch rooms and I didn't think to ask since I assumed all the rooms had this noise level from the bar. After discovering that we could have had a better room location, I asked the hotel manager for a discount and said I'd love to stay there again as long as I got a better room location.

The only fair way would be to split the review of the hotel from the area. Some of the problems my family(hubby and 2 teens) encountered were not the fault of the hotel. Yet the area is usually how most choose their hotel. The Ocean Park Inn: Even though I made reservations 6 months in advance they were not able to accomodate us in the same room for a week. The first 2 nights we stayed in a 2 room suite that overlooked their very nice and warm pool. This room had a large balcony(could fit 4 chairs) and a nice small view of the ocean. You could hear the ocean if you kept your patio door/windows open at night. The room was clean, decorated nicely and had a full size table and kitchenette. We really liked this room and pleaded with them to let us stay in it even though we would be giving up the full oceanview. It was perfect for the 4 of us. My teens could stay up later since it had a TV in the living/kitchen area and also one in the bedroom. Since they do assign rooms at the time of reservation we had to move to our 1 room oceanview room. This room was very spacious but not nearly as nice. It needed updating and the bathroom was in desparate need of caulking. The patio screen door was broke but they did fix it immediately when I called. The balcony was very small and could only hold 2 small chairs. This was the kind of room that even when cleaned(which they did a great job on) did not look like it because it was old and needed work. Showers in both rooms had excellent water pressure. We found the staff very pleasant and helpful. The continental breakfast was fabulous. Waffles, eggs, variety of cereals and the best cinnamon rolls and other pastries. I grade a continental breakfast on the serving of some kind of protein and they got an A+. Parking in their garage was an issue. We had rented a small SUV and most parking spots were for compact cars only. We had a very difficult time parking our car, often having to take up 2 compact spots, which everyone was having to do, which resulted in less spots. Also, if you came in late at night-forget about it. With updating and their doing work in the rooms, this hotel could be a 4* hotel. Our first room was great, our 2nd was not. Pacific Beach: The beach area and boardwalk were not clean. When asked, I was told they clean every Friday. Once a week is not enough with the amount of people in the area. Water temp was great@74degrees. However, we did not like the amount of seaweed that would wrap around you when playing in the waves. My teens loved the surf area which is separate from the swim area. The Pacifc Beach Surf Shop across from the hotel is the place to go for lessons and rentals. Gave us a discount since both kids got lessons and even gave us a 2 for 1 rental on skateboards. This is not an area for kids. I was not happy that my 2 teens were exposed to an area of heavy drinking. Open street bars everywhere and many adults were walking around that obviously had too much to drink. The bars were filled to capacity(seen as walking down the boardwalk) even during the day. Average age in the twenties. Felt we could put up with during the day but not good at night. I disagree with the previous reviewer, the area by this hotel is crowded. There were police patrolling and they were kept busy. Every night at least one big fight in the area. Usually over a girl. We read on this site about the homeless and were prepared. They sleep out on the benches on the boardwalk directly across from the oceanview rooms. Most are quiet but not always. I called the front desk at 5am one morning because of all the noise. They did send a security person out to ask the homeless to leave the area, which they did. The boardwalk is very busy, at least in August, with a lot of noise and partying crowds walking by until about 1-2am. For this reason, I cannot recommend this hotel to families, unless they reserved a room in the back of the hotel and off the boardwalk. We did not have any of these problems with our first room we had that was back by the pool. As you can see, this was a difficult review. Maybe a month other than August would be different. See my San Diego Crowds review. We liked having a Ralphs grocer, 7Eleven and numerous restaurants nearby. Just north of our hotel was Tower 23 and Pacific Terrace Hotel, both much quieter but a lot more expensive. A few blocks south was the Best Western, more in the mission beach area which is quieter. All are directly on the beach and boardwalk. The Pacific was on a bluff and had a lot of stairs to the beach.", "Date": "August 13, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Iowa", "Title": "\u201cPerfect spot on the ocean\u201d", "Author": "Kayla77", "ReviewID": "UR7712778", "Content": "We just returned from here.

However when I arrived, I was told that because I did not pay an additional twenty dollar fee that was never mentioned in the call, I did not have a confirmed reservation. I paid over $650 for the stay, made the extra effort to call and confirm the floor that I wanted and I certainly would have paid an extra $20 to make sure that I got the oceanview, if anyone had mentioned it. The Manager then tried to sell me on a second floor room with two Queen Beds, when I wanted a King Bed, for an additional $50 per night ($150). I was checking in early on a Thursday, and could hardly believe that all the rooms were occupied. As we discussed the options, the story changed at the Manager's convenience. They had at least two such rooms, but none with a King. I feel that the procedures of the hotel lend themsleves to a bait and switch type dynamic. Service was hit and miss. Some of the staff had bad attitudes and some of the staff were exceptionally helpful..so try not to take it out on the good ones.Because of this experience, the apparent dishonesty of more than one employee and the numerous BOLD RED signs warning of a $250 smoking fine, I half expected some bogus additional charges at departure and asked the Housekeeping Manager, Chris, to inspect the room prior to checkout even though I am a confirmed non-smoker.

In fact, I have booked a reservation in December. This is the second time I have stayed at this hotel, and I just love it. First of all, the hotel overlooks the ocean. You are ON the beach. Some people have complained about accommodations and service at this hotel, and granted, it is NOT the Ritz Carlton. I found the staff to be hard-working, and at times, over-worked, but friendly. I've also found that if you are nice, patient and friendly with people; they are likewise with you. We arrived in San Diego on Friday around 12:30 PM. Our room at the Ocean Park Inn was not yet ready, as they had 100 percent occupancy, and had to get the rooms cleaned for check-ins. Check-in time is 3 PM. My boyfriend and I parked our rental car in the OPI lot, and walked around the beach and went to lunch. When we checked back at 2:30 PM, our room was ready. I had booked a king, partial ocean view room on Expedia. This room was facing the pool, and beyond that, the ocean. Basically, it was an ocean front room without the ocean-front price!!!! We were thrilled!!!! This hotel is in such a great location that you don't really need a car. Unless you are going to SeaWorld or exploring San Diego, there is everything within walking distance to the hotel. My boyfriend and I walked so much that our legs and feet are sore!!! Across the street is a Ralph's grocery store; Starbucks; UNO restaurant (best pizza in town! great place!); Sketchers; Long's Drug Store; Jack in the Box; Wells Fargo ATM; 7-11. Down the street a bit is Rubio's and LaSalsa for fresh Mexican food, Taco Bell and Burger King. Next to the hotel is Taylor's Restaurant (which is good, but not great); Joe's Crab Shack (also good); and lots more of everything. For live music, try Blind Melon's (now 710 Ocean Avenue or something like that ) at the pier (two blocks away). They feature different music nightly, all of it good. For nightlife information, get a free San Diego READER magazine. For t-shirt or other beachwear shopping, try the beach front shops about 4 blocks south of the hotel. They have the BEST prices on sunglasses, postcards, t-shirts, hats, swimwear, etc. WAVE is a little pricey; try the unnamed \"mom and pop\" shops just past the Best Western and Surfer hotels. The OPI also offers a free continental breakfast, with cereals, fruit, bagels, sweet rolls, a variety of juices and coffee. Parking is now $7.00 per night, in a secured, underground garage. There is a microwave, refrigerator, in-room safe, hair dryer, coffee maker, iron and ironing board in each room. The beds are comfortable, and the rooms are clean. I much prefer OPI over the Best Western Blue Sea Lodge, because it is smaller and cleaner, and it caters more to families and couples than wild party people. I was very glad to be staying at the OPI instead of the Surfer Hotel, Blue Sea Lodge or other adjacent hotels, because the beach this past weekend was like Spring Break. Lots of wild, noisy, drunk 20-somethings...but none of them appeared to be staying at Ocean Park Inn. I also much prefer Pacific Beach to Ocean Beach. Ocean Beach is in an older, lower-income section of town, and I just did not feel safe in that area in general. While Pacific Beach has its share of homeless people, they tend to mind their own business. I felt quite safe walking at any time of the day or night on Pacific Beach, and there always seems to be people walking around, regardless of the hour.

We have been woken up several times by bums yelling in the early-morning hours; i.e., 12:00 am - 4:00 am - and have had to call the San Diego police department several times. Unfortunately, the only thing the police can do is shoo them off, but they come back an hour or so later. As the continued problem with loitering bums has been consistently becoming worse through the years, we will not be staying at the Ocean Park Inn any longer and will take our business further north.

When I called the hotel and spoke to Jade, she informed me only the GM could cancel the reservation, and that he would have to review the account to make sure I could do this. When I asked what that meant, she said that is the policy. I don't know about anyone else, but I have never been refused to cancel a reservation especially when it meets all the requirements, which in this case was a 72 hour notice, I am giving close to 72 days notice.

The whole hotel was terrible - cheap and depressing. Go there if you don't care how comfortable you will feel and don't mind the noise and the bums. I'll never ever go there - that's for sure!", "Date": "December 30, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Winnipeg", "Title": "\u201cGreat scenery\u201d", "Author": "WinnipegFamily", "ReviewID": "UR2852506", "Content": "My husband and I found this an excellent hotel. The view from our balcony was of the ocean and the sounds of crashing waves lulled you to sleep at night. The room was very large with an extra couch. The fridge and microwave were very handy. The bathroom was large and there was also a safe in the closet for valuables. The continental breakfast was amazing. So much selection and it was constantly being refilled throughout the morning. Housekeeping was very fast in getting your room clean. Most days it was done by the time we got back from breakfast. Free underground parking was also included. Room price was about $160 ($CAD) but we got the 4th night free through a promotional offer. Location wise, we had to drive everywhere but it wasn't too hard to find the sights we were looking for. The outdoor pool was heated and it could have been just a bit warmer but we used it anyway. The hot tub was great for temperature.", "Date": "November 29, 2004"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Ocean Park Inn", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g60750-d80251-Reviews-Ocean_Park_Inn-San_Diego_California.html", "Price": "$194 - $746*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">710 Grand Ave</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">San Diego</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">CA</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">92109</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "2515412", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/93/c2/08/ocean-park-inn-4th-of.jpg"}}
