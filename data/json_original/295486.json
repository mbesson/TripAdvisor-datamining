The Turkisch/European breakfast buffet can be enjoyed on the outside terrace, next to the swimming pool. (ignored the sound of the terminal and enjoyed all the rest). I had numerous ferrytrips to the European side and could not get enough of the great views, day or night. The courteous hotel staff was always helpful and made this hotel my home away from home.

The ferry is just across the road from the hotel, and ferries depart regularly every 20-30 minutes, take about 20 minutes to cross and only cost 1.5 TL per crossing. The views from the ferry are spectacular, especially at night. The only thing to watch out for is missing the last ferry home, which we think was 9.30pm or 10pm, but it's best to check before you leave! We had a triple room which was extremely spacious and comfortable, with everything we needed, a superb view across the Bosphorous and onto the swimming pool below. The pool was a haven from the bustle of Istanbul - large enough to get a proper swim, with plenty of loungers and shades, and never busy. The only slight downside to this hotel was that the breakfast was not great, but it was adequate for us (stale-ish bread, cheap luncheon meats, cheese, cake and boiled eggs). The food in the restaurant was fairly average, but not too expensive. The hotel staff didn't seem to speak English but this was not a problem for us either as we didn't lack anything. All in all we had an extremely enjoyable stay and would definitely visit this hotel again. Next time I will use the spa!", "Date": "August 25, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Berlin, Germany", "Title": "\u201cGreat view, location and staff make up for dated interior\u201d", "Author": "Berlinaut", "ReviewID": "UR61195047", "Content": "To my knowledge, Harem Hotel is currently the only asian side hotel that offers a view across the Bosphorus to Sultanahmet with Hagia Sophia and the Blue Mosque defining the skyline. And what a view! Go for one of the suites - for instance room 402 or 502 - and you'll also get a great vista towards the Golden Horn, Galata (with its tower) and Bey\u00c3\u00b6glu. The location is perfect, especially if you want to explore the fascinating asian side neighbourhoods - like the bustling, conservative muslim \u00c3\u0153sk\u00c3\u00bcdar or the modern and very western Kadik\u00c3\u00b6y and Moda - a hotspot for young, alternative hipsters. As mentioned by other guests, there's a ferry going directly from Harem to Sultanahmet, so you can do some guerilla sightseeing and take off back home, as soon as the tourist masses start making you claustrophobic. The port and bus station just in front of the hotel are pretty loud during the day, but close the windows and you won't hear a thing - at nighttime it's really quiet as well. Well up until sunrise, anyway, when the muezzin in the mosque next door starts his morning call. The staff at the hotel is incredibly courteous and will help you with everything - from arranging your transport to the airport and to explaining how you negotiate good deals at the grand bazar. There's always a smile and a blink of an eye - even when things don't work like they should at the hotel. And that's the only minus: the hotel is somewhat dated and sometimes not everything is functioning properly (in my case it was the internet). But it didn't at all have a negative impact on my stay at the Harem. This is Turkey, this is Istanbul - it's charming chaos!", "Date": "April 13, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oregon", "Title": "\u201cWorld Travelers...............................................Straight Information here!!!\u201d", "Author": "travelertwo2", "ReviewID": "UR51848314", "Content": "This is a second generation, family owned hotel.

We selected this hotel as we were staying two weeks purely as it had a swimming pool,terrace and fantastic viewS across to the Mosques, Topkapi Palace, and Galata tower. It is situated on a small but steep Hill so may not be suitable for the disabled. It is more like a two star rather than three by UK standards but there is 24 hr room service and fridges in the rooms, The rooms were cleaned exceptionally well daily... except for black mould on shower tiles. All rooms have balconies.and airconditioning,and not a sound could be heard when the doors were closed,even though the Mosque was nearby. We requested a sea view on booking and were not charged extra,and were able to chose our room on the top floor, rooms vary in size and decor.The staff were very courteous,kind and helpful.The hotel is not a typical tourist hotel, nor located in a tourist area, so may suit a traveller.most guests are Turkish usually business people during the week and families at weekends,so there is a real feel of Turkish Hospitality. There is Internet access and a Steam room... must book steam room in advance these facilities were free of charge. The swimming pool was always exceptionally clean and well maintained,and is surrounded by a lovely terrace with overhanging plants,trees and birdsong.Overall we enjoyed our stay.

Until the subway crossing of the Bosphorous is completed sometime in 2007 (if we're lucky) the only way to connect to the main part of the city (i.e. business centre and historic attractions) from this location is by boat from Uskudar or Kadikoy. Both ports are approximately 2 kilometres in opposite directions from the hotel, necessitating a taxi ride, local bus or a bit of a walk (walking at night, alone, as a tourist in Istanbul is not recommended.) Boat crossing costs 1.30 Turkish Lira and boats run every five minuytes or so from Uskudar and every 15-30 minutes from Kadikoy. The rooms tend to be a bit run down, but modern enough. The bathrooms are modern and clean. The views at night from the ocean-view rooms are spectacular. The food at the breakfast buffet is nice, and there's plenty of it. The staff open up the terrasse around the pool for breakfast and eating on the terrasse while watching the busy life of the harbour below you is a grand experience. There is wireless internet in the downstairs bar area. It is easy to find a place on one of the many chairs or sofas to read emails etc on your laptop and there is a computer terminal in the 'business centre' at which you can read your emails for free.
