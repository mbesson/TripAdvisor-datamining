We chose the hotel because it was affordable and the pictures of the rooms and bright yellow Spanish style building won us over. We were EXTREMELY disappointed! Let me first say that... IT LOOKS NOTHING LIKE THE PICTURES advertised on the internet. The bar and restaurant were closed the entire time we were there. When we got to our room it was hot and muggy because the a/c had not been turned on as a courtesy and the room reeked of some sort of perfume/disinfectant. The table and chairs on our balcony were covered in mildew. The headboards and frames on our beds were not secured, the pillows were flat, the bed was terribly uncomfortable and we woke up our first morning there with bites on our legs, arms and torso! OMG!... The iron was broken, the ironing board cover was covered in stains and don't even think about asking for extra towels or pillows! They acted as if I were asking for their first born! It was two of us and only one small hand towel. I love my sister but neither of us desired to share the same washcloth. Our room didn't get cleaned until late in the afternoon, and again two people, one washcloth. It was close to the airport so we knew we'd hear airplanes go by... but nothing could have prepared us for what we heard. We could have sworn that the planes literally taking off on the same street! We paid $109 a night, but it was worth every bit of $50 bucks a night.

Squished it and then followed my new personal procedure (thought up right then) for staying in hotels with confirmed bedbug sightings: all bags and clothes onto the fold down bench in the shower, and sleep with the light on. When I first arrived at this hotel there was a man ahead of me in reception complaining that the hotel had left his family's bags at the airport for 4 days after having promised to deliver them to his room. The receptionist's response was glib--something like \"well, you have them now, so it all worked out in the end!\" No apology. For me this was a last minute booking to save me from having to spend the night in the airport, so I tried not to judge. The man then said, \"this is an interesting hotel you run here. When I was here at 4pm there were four girls sitting at the bar drinking margaritas. Well, those same four girls are still here drinking the same margaritas!\" (It was then about 10pm.) There were indeed four pretty girls sitting at the end of the bar laughing with each other. I imagine that they were hired by the place to sit there, be pretty, and bring in traffic. My room was on the first floor behind the receptionist and the door slid open and closed. There was an alarm clock in the room but it was stuck at 12:00 and the time set buttons didn't work. The bathroom was very clean and the rest of the room looked clean enough (until the bedbug crawled out). There was a working minifridge in the room, and the TV gets 100 cable channels. The receptionist delivered the wake up call on time. The shower is a walk in and the bathroom was handicap accessible, with railings and a fold down shower bench. Water pressure was good. Soap & shampoo were provided. Towels were clean & plentiful. Street noise wasn't too bad and what noise there was could be drowned out with the window air conditioner. My #2 recommendation for improving this room, after fumigating the whole hotel for bedbugs, would be to get a working remote for the TV and put it in the room. #3 would be a working alarm clock.", "Date": "March 7, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "NJ", "Title": "\u201cWe liked it!!\u201d", "Author": "Tiffany627", "ReviewID": "UR19756877", "Content": "My friend and I stayed at the Hotel Villa del Sol and we thought it was great.

Our room was SMALL and musty smelling. There were those little tiny black ants in the bathroom. The knob on the bathroom sink came off with a lift. The shower handle was a challenge. There wasn't much play to the handle. The first night my husband ended up taking a cold shower because he hadn't figured out the trick to get the handle to turn in order to have hot water. The two other groups of family members staying at the hotel didn't get a shower the first night, because the hotels power went off/surged for a moment, thus rendering the hotel \"waterless\" for a couple of hours, apparently a common accurance. Thin pillows like the other review said. Also, amazed that there are no hand towels and only one wash cloth besides the two bath towels and bath mat. The street noise, people walking by talking, etc. are very noticable, as if the window were open when it wasn't. And to finish, we were there for four nights, and on the last night, I discovered the carpet is in desperate need of a shampooing. I put on a pair of socks after a day on the beach and had them on maybe, ten minutes, and had made a few trips \"around\" the room, back and forth to the bathroom, etc. then sat down on the bed and caught a look at the bottom of my feet--my white socks were black, YUCK! I'm glad that I hadn't noticed this on the first day, 'cause that would of made the stay that much worse, knowing what I was walking on and going to be walking on for the rest of my vacation.

There was no way someone could bathe (much less 6 people). I immediately went to the desk and explaiend the problem.

At the time, I was a bit skeptical due to our interaction with other hotel employees, but she was absolutely right. We were treated wonderfully.

Before booking the hotel I had read the reviews in this site, and I was terrified to go there, but this was a very affordable hotel and we booked it in spite of all the bad reviews. I must admit I was pleasantly surprise! This hotel, first of all, is small, but beautiful. The hotel staff was always courteous. The bar had all the drinks we wanted at a very low price. The pool was small but always warm and clean. The room was spaceous, and clean. The beach is very close.

The first night we found out that my pillowcase had blood stains. Then our toilet flooded the following day. We did not receive new towels 2 nights in a row...despite many visits to the front desk to ask for towels. Our fourth night the toilet flooded again. We reported it, once again, to the front desk and they just dried the floor and left. No apologies!! No nothing! And of course, our sixth and last night the toilet flooded one more time. But this time with more impetus and got some of our clothes wet. We once again visited the front desk. But since the incident happened after hours we had to wait until someone could come in and clean it. The manager came in and they just cleaned the floor. I demanded a new room!!! The manager gave us a room on the 3rd floor (no elevator!!) and didn't even bother to help us with our luggage or even apologize for the great inconvenience that this caused. Oh! Before I forget, I asked for an extra bed at the front desk and after paying for it, they told they'd bring it in. Two hours later I had not received my extra bed. I went to the front desk and the worker asked me to \"go and pick it up myself from the storage room\". Lastly, they charged a service fee when we checked out, I assume because of the toilet!! Anyway, this may all seem unbelievable, but it's true! Please don't make the mistake of staying at this hotel. For $92 a night you could find something better.
