What a find . . .\u201d", "Author": "txboiler1", "ReviewID": "UR126421731", "Content": "We stayed in Paris for two nights at the L'Empire Paris after having spent three nights at Disneyland Paris (at the Disneyland Hotel there). This was a family trip doing both \"The Mouse\" stuff and some sightseeing. Most of the reviews were positive for this hotel prior to my booking it, but they didn't do it justice. We were in room 303 - \"Rembrandt\" - I think. It overlooked rue de L'Arbre Sec. Location - The hotel is a 10 minute walk to Notre Dame, a 5 minute walk to The Louvre Museum, 20 minute walk to the Seine River boats/tours. There are huge department stores 2 minutes away. There are wonderful, cute little boulangerie/patisseries ALL around the hotel (3 minutes in any direction), and there are several little restaurants / wine bars on rue de L'Arbre Sec. You want to get on the Metro, you say? 3 minutes one way towards the Louvre for one station or 4 minutes the other way for Les Halles (a major RER + Metro/subway station). The hotel is tucked back 30 yards or so on rue de L'Arbre Sec, so it's not easy to spot from Rue de Rivouli (sp?). Once you find it, though, you're hooked. Rooms - We had a \"family room\" with a jacuzzi spa. It had a king bed (very comfortable) and a pull-out double for our two children in another room. Each room had it's own TV. Very modern, and very, very spacious by French/European standards. The bathroom was also very large and spacious by European standards. Then entire \"apartment\" was decorated in a very modern style which we all liked. Huge, spacious closets as well. Staff - The staff all spoke very passable English. My French is far worse than their English. They all were extremely accommodating - from asking for an extra luggage rack / holder in the bedroom, to asking to take some coffee and tea back to the room after our breakfast the staff was warm and welcoming. Better than the treatment we received at Disney, if you can believe that. The staff was knowledgeable about both the local area and how to get to different places. I'm sure they would have called a taxi if we didn't want to walk. Fluent in English, so no worries there. Breakfast - Breakfast was included with our room package. I would suggest that if you book at this hotel you ante-up for the breakfast. It had both hot and cold components, including salmon. Very upscale in both the presentation and the service. The restaurant / bistro (?) people were as nice as they could be. If you don't want breakfast at L'Empire, there is a McDonalds about a 3 minute walk from the hotel. You'll still spend 10 Euros per person, and you'll have to walk to get it. Downside - 1.) I don't know if this hotel would be a good choice from the middle of July through the middle of September. Our room did not have air conditioning, but it did have ample heat. The \"air conditioning\" we had to use was opening the big windows overlooking the street below. Effective in mid-March, but I don't know how effective it would be in the heat of the summer. 2.) Hot water - the temperature of the water in the shower changed every 2 - 3 minutes, when I suspect there was toilets flushing in other parts of the hotel. Come on, man! You can fix this with a 3 Euro valve, such that the water isn't scalding one minute and freezing the next. The water pressure wasn't that great, either, since it took almost 25 minutes to fill the jacuzzi tub. Summary - I would most definitely stay here again. Close to everything. Wonderful staff (better than Disney in most respects). Good breakfast. I would even suggest \"buying up\" to stay here if you have the means.", "Date": "March 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "sydney", "Title": "\u201cperfect in every sense\u201d", "Author": "crisb7", "ReviewID": "UR126398401", "Content": "My wife and i stayed here for a week, this was our fourth visit to Paris and was by far the best hotel with the best staff we have experienced so far in Paris.

There was a fully-stocked minibar, robes, furry slippers, separate toilet room, but too small bath/shower room that had a tower-heating rack however. There was a large screen TV with ipod holder. Male front-desk staff and bellboys were very friendly, and made the stay pleasant. Breakfast included in the room price was of mixed review. The bread basket and freshly-squuezed juice choices were excellent. The eggs were green and inedible as was the cheese (old brie) on some days. But the mixed bread/croissant basket made up for this. The cappuccinos were terrible, so don;t bother ordering cappuccino here -- stick to the cafe au lait which was fine. There is no spa or terrace bar unless they mean the tables outside on the sidewalk in front of the construction.

As you walk into a rather wide hallway, which is the lobby, you realize that in lieu of the front desk there is a pedestal upon which a laptop computer rests and behind which stands an earnest, friendly young staff ready to greet you and check you in. As you look around, you may be somewhat comforted to see another room to your left in which there is a bar and eating area, and another room to your right in which you see newspapers in several languages ready to view, along with a small but interesting selection of books available to you during your stay. If you are checked into Room 402 as we were, you will find yourself in a very small room with no chair and no desk and with barely enough space for two persons to move around without saying \"excuse me\" to one another. This may not be what you expected, so, since you got in writing that your reservation includes a chair and a desk -- you did do that, didn't you? -- you do succeed in getting moved to Room 202 for the rest of your stay. This room is much better. It is perhaps 50% larger and has a place to sit and a desk. There is much more good news here. The young multilingual staff are very helpful and friendly. Upon checking in we were given a list and map, created by L'Empire, of local restaurants which they recommended. We followed this for every dinner during our stay and it was a super, super guide to local cafes which is worth its weight in gold and which is providing our favorite memories of Paris. A buffet breakfast was included in our rate. This was more than adequate and was quite enjoyable every morning we were there.

Its location is it best feature being situated very close to both the Pont Neuf and The Louvre. To me this is a hotel trying very much to be a boutique hotel but done on the cheap and is now starting to fray around the edges. Where you should have seen leather they used faux leather which is starting to peel, the red tops of the small reception pedastals for example. For the bar, white covered MDF, which again is starting to show signs of age. The reception/lobby area has a machine that pumps out sickly sweet smoke/essence, again missing the mark, not at all like the very nice subtle almond/spice smells of the Gramercy Park or W in New York for example. We were staying in a room in the basement (Superior) and the carpet in the hallway outside had a large stain on it, a vacume cleaner was an ever present article in the stair well during our entire stay. The room itself was a good size but again it was all starting to look very shabby, the wardrobe door had a couple of large chunks out of the front, the tiles in the bathroom had been poorly grouted and made you focus on these rather than the actually sizeable bathroom. This leads me onto the shower (always my first barometer of a decent hotel room!) it was one of those extensions off of the main mixer tap unit and looked pretty poor. However looks can and were decieving and the shower was really powerful which leads me onto the next issue. The shower screen was woeful and could not contain the volume of water, the first time my wife used it we had a serious flood in the bathroom, a 2 inch deep puddle across the whole floor. The staff were quick to supply us with a mountain of towels to mop up the mess but this is a problem that could and should be avoided. The bed was huge and comfortable with clean bedding but the pillows were like sleeping on 2 blocks of concrete, really hard uncomfortable foam. We phoned down but the guy was unhelpful and we spent the first night using the supplied bath robes as pillows, again pretty unacceptable. The next day 2 new softer pillows turned up but again these were pretty poor in quality. Also our toiletries were not refreshed during the whole duration, i think that had run out of the \"Bulgari\" toiletries as when i asked the maid i was left with a rather blank expression, lucky then that the store room was left open and i could wander in and replenish the shower gel and shampoo with another product. One thing that cannot be faulted was the breakfast included in the price of the room, lots of choice, fresh and very tasty. To summarise this hotel is in the perfect location, some aspects of it were good and the staff tried hard but it is needs to tidy up as it is missing the mark for what it is trying to be.", "Date": "June 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Newry, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cA very enjoyable, relaxing holiday.\u201d", "Author": "gobi44", "ReviewID": "UR106199440", "Content": "Myself and my husband stayed in L'Empire and were impressed by the friendly staff and the lovely hotel.

Its just 2 red block or columns standing next to each other where the receptionist stands to take calls etc. A bit bizarre.

We stayed for 5 nights and every night either sweeties or chocolates were left on our pillow. We had complimentary bath robes and slippers. The room was spotlessly clean - no sign of dirty curtains as previously discussed in another review. There was a problem with the bath tap but the staff could not do enough to help and even though it was a Friday evening took steps to locate a plumber. As the plumber could not come until the following day we were offered a different room on the first floor. I must admit that room was much smaller and cramped than our suite and I would not have traded places. There is some noise outside at night but that is only to be expected as the hotel is situate just off the main road Rue de Rivoli. There are street cafes around and cafe life is such in Paris that you have to expect some noise. We felt that this was a minor price to pay though for the excellent location. There is a fabulous patisserie just around the corner which is not to be missed.

We were reminded no less than 3 times that we had been upgraded and once again when shown in to the suite. The bedroom was pleasant but lounge area very crampt with almost no daylight.

Avoid the front of the hotel - with no double glazing this will always be a problem - we may have just have left the window open!

The room was really big with a stylish decor and very large and comfortable bed! We are both quite tall and often find French beds a bit too short for us.

Bathroom was big too, but noticed some flaws in the design, there's very little space around the sinks (we had double sinks in ours) to put your toiletries on, no hooks for the towels or robes and no shower curtain or proper cubicle, just a tiny little glass wall in the end of the bath which basically meant it was very difficult to shower without flooding the entire bathroom.

The Louvre is literally a stones throw up the road, the Seine is about 5 minutes walk, if that, and the hotel is tucked away just off the main road but surrounded by lovely little restaurants, bars and cafes. The metro is just accross the road for anyone wanting to go farther afield, but we found it very easy to walk everywhere and to use one of the boats on the river to go up to spots like the Eiffel tower. The boats are very reasonable and a much nicer way to see Paris than going underground via the metro! When we arrived at the hotel, the staff were very friendly and upgraded our room straight away. Having read lots of stories about how small rooms in Paris are, we were very surprised. Our room was really lovely with lots of space, a huge window looking down to the street below, and a huge bathroom. The bed was extremely comfortable and large. The hotel provides dressing gowns and slippers, leaves sweets on your pillow when you go out and has a well stocked and reasonable mini bar. There is a cafe downstairs that looks very trendy although we didn't get a chance to use it. They also offer facilites such as in room massage, although again, we didn't have enough time to use this! There is an excellent room service menu and the room was immaculately clean. I would definitely stay in this hotel again, and I would recommend it to anyone visiting Paris.

The hotel staff were friendly and helped out when asked (restaurant recommendations/ bookings, maps, tours etc.) I would stay here again.", "Date": "July 9, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hampshire", "Title": "\u201cMixed feelings\u201d", "Author": "SarahDarren", "ReviewID": "UR14678351", "Content": "Hi My husband booked a night away in Paris the day before departure and selected this hotel via the Eurostar website. We have mixed reviews because the hotel left very little impression on us. This hotel is situated in the heart of Paris centre so the location as previoulsy mentioned is great. We didn't have to walk too far to visit many of the top attractions, and there are bistro/restaurants all around the hotel. It's located on a side street off the main Rue Rivoli and near Rue Honore. The positives were the friendly staff and the room size was great (we were on the top floor in a deluxe room). However to be honest I was glad to get out because the overall impression was that it was cold, dark, slightly clinical and theres not really a vibe about it. The floorings are all hard, walls are either painted white, grey or black with a few splashes of red and the check in desk is just two columns. It's neither contemporary or funky and I think it will look very dated very quickly. I normally love modern boutique hotels but this just didn't fit the bill. The stairwell (the lift only goes to the 5th floor) was like one out of a hospital with awful flooring and dodgy paintwork. It really spoilt the entrance to our room. We didn't stay to eat breakfast, we went out to eat at a local restaurant. We very nearly walked out to stay somewhere else but as we were only there one night we couldn't be bothered. In response to previous points regarding the sitting room with fireplace, it is now open next to the entrance. It's neither cormfortable or warm and has white/grey walls with just 4 small leather tub chairs and two tables, with a modern fireplace which wasn't on. The blinds are black and were closed. Anyway enough doom & gloom. We wouldn't stay again, we love boutique hotels but prefer luxurious furnishings.", "Date": "March 31, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "St Albans", "Title": "\u201cLovely, modern hotel\u201d", "Author": "GemmaO", "ReviewID": "UR13903562", "Content": "My boyfriend and I have just got back from Paris and really enjoyed our stay at L'Empire hotel. We had a lovely big room with wooden flooring, a huge king size bed which was very comfortable (apart from the pillows were a bit hard), big LCD TV, very big bathroom with 2 sinks and the shower was extremely powerful. Fabulous location a 2 minute walk from the Louvre and the Metro, you couldn't ask for a more central location. The only slight down side is that because the hotel is so central you may find that when you go to sleep you can still hear a bit of noise, but it really didn't effect us at all, so don't let that put you off staying at this hotel.

I can't fault the rooms and the location, particularly the little cafe on the corner nearby which did amazing lunch, traditional French things. But.........on returning from dinner at 12pm we found a party going on in the block of flats next door to the hotel, our upgraded room was only two windows away and the noise was unbelievable. Being tolerant Brits we didn't mind despite it being extremely loud, thinking it might end at 2am, unfortunately by 2.30am it was getting worse. I went down to complain only to find other people down there already complaining. The hotel staff said there was nothing they could do, the police had come and not been able to find the party. I suggested they ring them again and I could lean out of the window and show them were it was ! The hotel wouldn;t call the police again and insisted the hotel was full and we couldn;t be moved. The party went on until 5.30am and we could not sleep at all. Once we finally slept we woke up at 12noon the next day and therefore missed out on our morning in Paris (we were only there for one night). Despite this the hotel insisted we paid the full \u20ac300 room rate. Insisting we had to email the manager on our return to the UK. We did but surprise surprise the email bounced, and the hotel will not return our repeated emails. Do not stay at this cr\u00e1phole. It might have been an isolated incidence but no effort was made to accomodate us elsewhere or to find us an alternative hotel. For a couple on a rare night away from a young baby this was not exactly what we wanted from a night in Paris.

The rooms exceeded our expectations. Not sure if we were upgraded but the room was really big for Europe, double sinks in the bathroom etc. Everything is really modern, fresh and clean. The staff couldn't do enough for us, were really friendly and helpful. We went to Moulin Rouge which I would really recommend, the show is fantastic and well worth the money. Best to book direct as you pay a premium for the hotel to book, but at least it is hassle free. My only complaint would be that the walls are pretty thin. A couple in the next room were having a huge row at 2am one night and the walls felt paper thin. No noise the following night after they had moved out so I'm not sure if they were just exceptionally bad and would have been heard word for word anywhere!

We'd never stayed in the 1st arr before - it's OK but we prefer the other bank. The hotel is what they call a \"minimalist\" style - no table in the room, so breakfast was literally in bed, really no other furniture other than a very large and comfortable bed and plasma screen TV with no English channels. No lobby to speak of, which is OK by us though. Certainly NOT a traditional Parisian hotel with silk wall coverings and Louis XV furniture. Very modern, very hip - not our bag though. Great for a quiet stay though.

The hotel is modern and clean. We found the staff very welcoming and friendly. We were also told that our reservation had been upgraded to a Suite. Very nice!! The accommodation was excellent; large bathroom with shower, the sitting area had the mini bar, wardrobes, sofa bed and it's own plasma TV and the large bedroom also had it's own plasma TV. Of the 1045 TV channels available, only 4 are in English (but we didn't come to Paris to watch TV!!)
