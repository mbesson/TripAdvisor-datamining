{"Reviews": [{"Content": "good business hotel I stayed already few times in lungwood hotel, it is a good business hotel, rooms are cleaned, big enough for the japanese standard. breakfast is good for quality but not for the variety, typical japanese breakfast, mainly japanese business men stay in here. as foreigner, i miss international channels, more variety on breakfast, internet broadband free an high speed, there is a fitness and swimming pool but you will have to pay for them. the location is ok and really depending what you have to do, but for short stay i would recommand this hotel, be aware it is a very busy hotel and need to book few weeks in advance as the price is quiet resonable.", "Date": "Oct 23, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR714817741", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "gaidjin"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1066441-d557562-r21121918-Hotel_Lungwood-Arakawa_Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html", "HotelID": "557562", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
