No, the towels are not the best - not bath sheet or towel size, but I had seen the warnings on this, so had bought my own, but they served the purpose if needed. Modern facilities and great to have a fridge and microwave in the room as well as a large flat screen TV.

With big hotel names like Ramada, Hilton and many other showing up. We tried to find a hotel that had a reasonable location, accommodation, and price. Something that wasn't too cheap or too expensive, yet still was pretty good.\u00a0 Cassandra Hotel stood out from the rest. Not only is the location quite prime being in the Kingsway Area (which is pretty close to central/downtown Vancouver) it is also quite close to Metrotown, which is excellent for shopping. The only downside to the location is that it's quite hard to get anywhere to and from the hotel without having a car. The overall accommodation is great as the hotel is really clean and comfortable. It might not be as luxurious as other hotels, yet it had a warm and friendly environment. With the receptionist greeting us in and out of the hotel at all times. One receptionist (named Jenny) was especially helpful and informative regarding the hotel facilities. This really impressed us at how well trained and personal the staff is at this hotel.\u00a0 A definite plus of the hotel is the complimentary breakfast of a muffin, juice, and croissant. Although it wasn't much, it made us feel appreciated and it also tasted good as well. For the price, Cassandra Hotel has a excellent wifi service. With about 3 wifi locations inside the hotel so that it's really easy to get a high signal strength. The rooms really impressed us the most. They have a quite large space for the room and the clean bed sheets changed everyday. We also liked the room's simple yet elegant minimalist design while still including useful amenities (like the microwave/coffee maker). The only downside to the rooms are the beds that slopes inside and the fairly loud fan. All in all for about C$70- C$110 a night (depends on the day and rooms available), this has been one of the more memorable stays we had in Canada.

The hotel is based near china town, about 8 stops from downtown Vancouver on the skytrain, the station of which is about a 10 minute walk from the hotel.

My kids enjoy the whirlpool and sauna service there, and that's for free. The frontdesk staff can speak our language, we are really appreciated because we can know more information about how to get our sin card and they help us a lot. Thanks. We are new here, but they let us feel better in a totally new place. The room is pretty large enough for our 4 people, my wife, my two daughters and me. But the only thing is that they don't have a kitchen.We were planning to live here monthly, coz they have monthly rent which is much cheaper than paying daily; but we need a kitchen. Friendly and multi-language staffs make our stay very happy. So if you like us,a family,we suggest you living there.

The room was clean-ish and didn't smell of smoke, but there was a cigarette burn on the bedspread, the soap was about as big as a 50-cent piece and only slightly thicker, the sheets were thin and limp (polyester?), the pillows were hard, the towels were small. I had to go down to the front desk and sign for a TV remote - I guess people steal them or something. And as others have noted here, they charged $5 a day for internet wi-fi. The desk clerk had trouble setting up an ID for me so I didn't get to use internet the first day but they charged me for it anyway. But the real rip-off came when I decided to check out a day early and go stay near the airport for the last night because a) I had a 7:00am flight the next day and b) I couldn't wait to get out of there. I notified them the night before that I would be leaving in the morning, and the clerk on duty said no problem. But the next morning the kid on the front desk charged me for the full 3 days. He said their cancellation policy required 48 hour notice and his manager would be angry if he gave me a \"discount\". But the manager was not there and the clerk refused to call him. I made the clerk print out a copy of the cancellation policy for me, and it turned out to be the standard \"no show\" policy where if you don't come at all and fail to notify them 48 hours in advance they can charge you for 1 night. It says nothing about leaving a day early after you have arrived. I am disputing the bill right now via American Express.

Despite the apparent cleanliness of the room, it did not make up for the lack of courtesy from the hotel staff--no one looked up when you walked in and they seemed annoyed by the simplest of questions. The rooms were big enough for four of us and could be satisfactory if there for a night or two. We stayed for an entire week and the longer we stayed, the more creepy it got. Besides the smell of ganga, a persistent garlic/onions aroma pervaded the second floor. About 25 minutes away from city center, but the area around Cassandra is pretty interesting in and of itself. An Indian movie theater, restaurants, Starbucks, and a Safeway are all in walking distance. If you go, check out the Jaguar's pub at the Ramada up the street...one word: CLASSY. They even have a Jam night on Sundays, definitely worth checking out. And if you find yourself on Marine Drive, look for the bun master, it's the best baked goods you'll ever eat. Overall, if you're with a family, avoid Cassandra. But if you're like me and my friends (a group of twenty-somethings looking for an interesting/cheap hotel) Cassandra is the way to go.
