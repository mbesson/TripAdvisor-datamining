We had chosen this Best Western because we have never been disappointed by a Best Western hotel, and because we wanted a hotel close to the Harrah's casino so its location was perfect for us. You walk five minutes and you are at the Harrah's ! We found the area safe even late at night. Valet parking was easy and fast, and so very convenient. Front desk staff was OK, professional and pretty friendly. Our room was really very nice and comfortable, bathroom also. I just regret they didn't tell us at front desk that our room had no window, so we might have tried to get an other one. I am claustrophobic so that was a very unpleasant surprise for me. They knew it because I told them I don't use elevators, and asked for a room at a low floor (here they were very kind and did their best but couldn't help much as the hotel was pretty full so we got a room at the 6th floor). Well, the beds were very comfortable, so I finally managed to sleep ! Breakfast was OK, yet with average food, they could propose a wider variety. And the breakfast area is not very large, it was crowded when we came down and had a hard time finding a seat. Anyway, we'll definitively choose this hotel again next time we'll be in New Orleans. Very nice rooms, good price, and perfect location (just a few minutes drive - and very easy - to parking lots for French Market).

It was everything we ever looked for coming to New Orleans. But we had a very negative experience with the front office staff regarding our laundry. We had a desperate need to get some of our clothes washed. And was given a laundry bag in the reception, as it was missing in our room. I delivered it down the same night to the receptionist, and was told it would be ready the day after before 6. The day after there where no signs of our laundry, I thought maybe it had been delayed, and wasn't warned because we had a couple of more days to stay. The day after that, we are on the third day, I asked again. And they had found a bag in the back of the front-desk. And it was my laundry! unwashed! They called the laundry and ordered a speed pickup as i was listening. I was in a hurry because the day after was our check out day. They told me that it was going to go just fine. The next morning as we where checking out, I asked if my laundry had arrived. And they had the bag with my dirty laundry still sitting in the reception. As I said earlier, I would have given this hotel top rating, if it hadn't been for this terrible incident. The rooms where great, the bathroom large and spacious.

Let me say now, that we booked a room without a window. We knew this when we made the reservation. However...nothing prepares your brain for what it actually means to stay in a room without a window. Upon reaching the seventh floor we noticed filthy carpet in the hallways. Like all of the grime of Bourbon street had been building up on it for months. When we got into the room, I noticed that the carpet in here was not that much better and the bathroom floor looked as though it hadn't been mopped in weeks. The whirlpool tub was gross - all the jets were dirty looking. By the way, who takes a bath in hotels? That is so grody. Whirlpools suck all your dirty, and everyone's dirty into the pump and it just festers in there. Then when the next person gets in and turns the jets on, all that dirty gets pumped into your bath and swirled all around you. Sick! The shower pressure was great. It really helped blast all of the dirt, grime and sweat that one accumulates while roaming around NOLA in July. The linens on the bottom of the bed, that serve no other purpose than to either be decoration or to allow you to lay on the bed with your shoes on and to have somewhere to put your dirty feet besides the actual bed, were filthy with big blotchy stains on them. They immediately went on the floor over by the TV. One of our pillow cases was completely shredded. I'm not talking a few little holes here and there. Shredded. There's no way housekeeping didn't see it. You could see as much actual pillow as pillow case. My friend peeked behind the curtain covering a mirror window on the wall and scared herself because she saw one of our reflections in it. We laughed about it for a while, but as the weekend progressed, the windowless room became a bigger issue. We couldn't tell if it was light or dark outside, if it was raining or not, or if robot aliens were taking over the city. We would've been the last to know, because we had zero access to the outside world in that room. It really started bugging us, but never as much as it did very early the morning of our departure. For those of you that don't know, even the French Quarter has its limits. It's been a while since I've stayed out late enough to know this, but about 3-4 a.m., the NOPD drives their cars up Bourbon street with the lights flashing and the loudspeakers blaring with a message of - you don't have to go home, but you gotta get the h*ll out of here. So, it was about 4:15 when some of the hardcore fun seekers got back to the hotel. One person decided to slap the door of a nearby guest for about 15-20 minutes until finally I heard someone say [laughing] - hey man, I think you're on the wrong floor. Enter stage right, a girl who really wanted \"Jay\" to open the door to their? room. \"Jay, open the door. Open the door Jay. Jay. Jay. Jay. Open the door.\" So about 4:45 I'm laying there thinking about the drunk action in the hallway and what if that progressed to some dangerous stuff and what if one of them dropped a cigarette or something and lit the floor on fire, and the hallway went up in flames? We would be in some deep you-know-what because there's no other way to get out besides the door! I started having a pretty good panic attack at that point. What I'm trying to tell you is, you might want to pay the extra bit of money the hotel charges to stay in a room with a window. OR - just stay at another hotel. A cleaner hotel. The continental breakfast, though it had lots of choices, was pretty blah. None of the choices were very appetizing to the 8 of us who stayed there. Try eating at Red Gravy a couple of roads over if you want some yummy fuel that'll help get you through the day. The location of the hotel is great. The people who worked there were nice. The valet situation, especially upon checkout is sort of obnoxious. We tried calling down for our car, but they couldn't hear us and we ended up waiting over half an hour for the car once we were down in the lobby with all our stuff. Oh and by the way - when you get your car from valet - in July - in NOLA - after they've been running all morning...it will smell like a valet that's been running all morning. In NOLA. In July. We had a fun trip. The windowless room was like being in an episode of The Twilight Zone - it altered reality a bit. The hotel was cheap for the area and we didn't spend that much time there.

The hotel is just a few steps from Canal street; only a 2 min walk to the Canal St Trolley and within a couple blocks of St Charles Ave (take the trolley to the Garden District), Bourbon St and French Quarter. It is also a few minutes walk from the Casino. The rate was good and water pressure/temperature in the shower was excellent. My room (#408) was located VERY close to the elevators and vending machines, but I didn't hear a sound. CONS: The mattress was the WORST! I had to cut my stay short by 3 days prior to checking in, which I was disappointed about, but I am so grateful that happened because the mattress was totally spongy/springy and worn out. I spoke to the front desk clerk in the morning and asked if there was another room I could change to because the bed was awful. She acknowledged the mattresses are all old and because of that changing rooms wouldn't make a difference. No apology or offer to discount the rate was made, which surprised me. Not only was the mattress well beyond the point of needing to be replaced, the hotel uses cheap small \"throw cushion\" type pillows, and one of the pillowcases was filthy (see photo). I cannot imagine how a anyone could wash, dry, fold it and make the bed and not see the stain... it was also on the bottom side, obviously meant to hide it. On my second night I didn't get back from a business dinner until about 1am. When I entered the hotel, no one was at the desk. I went to my room and called the Front Desk. The man who answered the phone was extremely rude and cut me off mid-word with \"What time do you want the wake-up call?\" I excused myself and said that I wasn't finished speaking, and was calling to have the phone/clock replaced while I was out the following day in addition to the wake up call. He did not apologize for being so rude and interrupting me. The hotel has old tube TVs, and the sound/video on the TV in #408 is very fuzzy. (Although, if you're in New Orleans, why bother watching TV?!) I completed a survey emailed to me about my stay, and also emailed the hotel to outline these issues.

If you're gonna stay in this hotel, DON'T be late for the checkout, DON'T try to check out early, and definitely DON'T do anything that would require you to have to speak to this horrific woman.

It is just three blocks from the start of Bourbon street and is itself off the main drag of Canal. Crossing over Canal, Magazine street turns into Decatur and is just a 10 minute walk from world-famous Cafe du Monde. The shower water pressure is good, the rooms modern, clean and comfy(recently updated) and the wifi is decent. The free breakfast is the typical pastries, cereal, etc. Since this is in New Orleans, the air conditioning is paramount and I'm happy to say it's capable although a bit loud. The price is right and the location is prime if you book *early* for Mardi Gras(not at all too far from the parades, but not too close where you'll be pushing over people just to get out or people throwing up on you). Now, for my problems with this hotel, it's the service which blows. Since parking seems to be the number 2 industry of New Orleans after tourism, it's hard to find and expensive when you do in downtown New Orleans(for example, there is a restaurant just across the street which charges $20 to valet, just for dinner!). Essentially, you are left with having to valet with the hotel. Well, the first time I asked for my car, the valet brings it around from the garage and scrapes my front, left rim on the curb. You'd think that a valet, who parks and retrieves cars all day, would know where the curb is or at the very least be extra careful not to scrape a rim. On some cars, rims can run $400 each! He then had the presumption to loiter around while I was visibly upset getting into my car like I was going to give him a tip! When we came back from dinner around 11pm(from the excellent but pricey Commander's Palace just two miles away), there was a line of cars in front of the hotel waiting to be parked. We sat in the steet, essentially blocking a lane of traffic, for *20* minutes, no valets to be seen. My wife went in to ask what the deal was and was told they'd be back shortly. So we waited another ten minutes with the other cars in the street til two valets come leisurely strolling down the street from the garage to start parking more cars. After we got back in the hotel, I went straight to the front desk and asked what the reason was for the delay. The desk attendant demurred saying sometimes it just takes a while. I then told her I felt the $28 per day was poorly spent to have to wait 30 minutes and especially blocking a lane of traffic and asked to have this charge reversed for poor service. Her response? In a shining example of poor customer service, she said New Orleans is a big city and there are plenty of other places to park a car while giving her co-workers nearby a sideways glance. I was utterly shocked and then livid at this response. This is *not* customer service, she didn't even try to \"fix things\" which is the number one rule of customer service. She did not try to apologize, explain, comp, offer a future discount or anything. I have stayed at over 40 Best Westerns across the country(and even the other one just on the other side of the French Quarter 3 years ago) and this was the single most incredibly poor experience I've ever had with a Best Western. So, overall, my advice is to stay here if you really want the good location and a decent nightly rate, but do so with the clear understanding that the staff(and ultimately the onsite management) is likely the worst example possible within the otherwise decent Best Western family of hotels. You are really rolling the dice handing your keys to the valets there(and who knows what negligence they will treat your car with while behind the wheel out of your view!). A giant scrape on my front, left rim is not the souvenir I was expecting to get in New Orleans! Also, the sidewalk is at a high angle to the street, so be careful when opening your door(and watch that the valet is too!) or that will likely get raked over the concrete as well.", "Date": "July 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Morecambe, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cnightmare Manager\u201d", "Author": "rosie_priestley", "ReviewID": "UR115446665", "Content": "The hotel is in the perfect downtown place to see the city, it looks lovely inside however do not be sucked in!!!!! We were 2 friends male and female travelling together, when we arrived we were met by a lovely man(Quenten) booked us in gave us our room perfect - then we opened the door - we had a kingsize bed!!!! no other bed at all in the room and since Im a married woman and my male friend is gay this was totally unacceptable! Right back down to reception and explained the situation - we had booked a queen queen room which we believed contained 2 queen size beds? Yes thats what the room we had booked was however the hotel was full and they had no other rooms to offer us!!!! the nightmare began!!! There was no roll away bed to offer us and the best he could do was give us extra bedding so my friend could sleep on the floor!!!!! We paid for 2 beds and my friend had to spend the night on the floor - great start!!!! We were assured this could be easily sorted out at 9am when the manager was back in Next morning after a very uncomfortable night for my friend on the floor we went at 10am expecting to be able to speak with the manager - was met by a very hostile receptionist who informed us of 3 different time the manager would be in work. when i questioned she had given me 3 different times, without even allowing me to finish what i was saying she shouted at me - erm i thought we were the guests in the hotel and they were providing us with a service??? We were given another room at 11.30 however still didnt see the manager of the hotel until about 2.30pm and then our niightmare really began. She told us we got what we paid for - we were really shocked since we were holding a booking confirmation that stated we had booked a room with 2 beds - OK the manager said we have sorted it now whats the problem? even more shocked now we explained we had paid for 2 beds and only received one, she then said she would speak to Bookit.com and see if she could get us a refund for the night we only had 1 bed - ok we thought thats fair enough and we went about our holiday. The next morning we got up late and went down to reception about 10.30 to see who were had been told was the manager the day before however she was sat in the lobby on a sofa talking to someone - so as not to be rude and interrupt her we decided to go out and see her later, however as we reached the door of the hotel she looked up and shouted across the hotel \"Bookit.com said they would refund you 20%\" I was so embarrassed by this outburst in front of other guessed I just said \"thank you and left\" however when we spoke to Bookit.com later that day they said they didnt say they would refund anything. We were feeling quite upset by this time and decided to contact Best Western Customer Services who informed us the person we had been speak to (the manager) was not the manager at all so things got worse - we got the name of the General Manager of the hotel and spoke to her and then things really did get bad. She screamed at us on the phone to check out of the hotel - oh my god I really couldnt believe this was happening and really believed there was no way things could get any worse however they did. After the General Manager had told us how sorry she was for what she said the very next morning there was a banging on our door like there was a fire in the building since we had put the \"do not disturb\" sign on our door we really did think there must be some sort of emergency that someone would bang on our door so loudly and with the sign there. My friend opened the door and a woman burst through it and right away began shouting at me - I was in total shock and had no idea who this woman was! I asked very calmly excuse me who are you? she informed me she was in fact the General Manager and wanted us out of her hotel by 11.30am at this point it was actually 11.45am when i asked why she informed me that I had complained that the iron in the room was not working right!!!! We choose to ignore this person however it did have a very big impact on the rest of our stay - we feared to go out of the hotel and leave our belongings in case they were not there on our return, we feared to speak to any of the staff in case this woman became irrational again and our room was never cleaned from that day on - to get clean towels we had to go to reception and ask for them daily and anything else we didnt dare ask for. So if you want somewhere that looks nice on the surface, you get screamed at by the staff and you fear for your things then this is the place for you. However if you want somewhere you will receive polite professional staff then go somewhere else and I have not exaggerated any of this if anything I have not expressed just how bad it really was", "Date": "July 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Philadelphia", "Title": "\u201cSweet Spot\u201d", "Author": "moonmanphoto", "ReviewID": "UR115247342", "Content": "I can not say enough nice things about this location and its staff.

The rep at the 1-800 Best Western number said the fee was $22 a night for pets. I told him we had two dogs. He said that that would be $22 for the pet fee for the one night we booked. However, upon check out, the bill showed that I had been charged $20 per pet on my credit card, a total of $40.00. I told the desk clerk this was not what I had been told when I made my reservation. She called over the manager who came to talk with me fifteen minutes later. The manager argued that the Best Western website states the pet policy is $20 per night. It doesn't. For this hotel, it says to call to verify the pet fee. Disgusted, and realizing that the manager would not budge and take off the extra $20, my husband and I left the hotel. I also told the manager that our room had been booked as one with a city view and all we got was a view of a brick wall and that in the morning, a maintenance man walked on the ledge right outside our third floor window and looked in on us! The manager wasn't bothered or apologetic. After our trip, I posted a complaint at the Best Western site and heard from someone from the hotel. She refused to refund my $20.00. I do not like to complain. But this, to me, was downright rude. Since I was told the pet fee was only $22, then charged $20 for each pet and then when I argued was told if I had only looked up the policy on the website, I would have known it, frustrates me. And in addition, having a hotel maintenance man looking in on us from a window was just creepy!
