The breakfast buffet was wonderful and the staff kept the food replenished during the entire breakfast from 6:30 AM until 9:30 AM.

Each room has a refrigerator and a microwave. The bathrooms have been remodeled and the showers have a functional shower head that varies pressure and spray. The rooms are kept very clean by a cheerful cleaning staff. Coffee is available in the lobby at anytime and it was good. However, the room also had a coffee maker that made one cup at a time and the quality of this coffee was outstanding. Usually the coffee in most motel rooms is almost undrinkable. We had a king size bed that was very comfortable with nice clean bedding. The room was not huge but very adequate with a table and two chairs, a computer desk with ergonomic chair, and a comfortable, overstuffed armed chair. The open closet was about 6 feet long and easily held our clothes as well as our luggage on the floor. The TV was good and had many channels including HBO. The location is perfect.

Another person staying at the motel suggested that I use a big trash bag and tie it around the tank to catch the water. Fortunately it worked, although I should not have had to do that myself. I had to use some towels to soak up the water and when I asked for more to shower with, they didn't have enough! The water wet the filthy carpet so the room stank the entire weekend. (They had no other rooms or I would have moved.) Later that night, my 10 year old found a cup filled with a condom box that had been left in the room from a previous occupancy and the cleaning staff had not discarded it.

The location is very close to sea world and major highways, but it is also in a bad area. I would not feel safe walking around outside at night. We stayed here because it was one of the few reasonably priced hotels on hotels.com. Also it was rated 2 out of 4 stars on hotel, which I thought would be a good rating. Obviously I was wrong. I will never trust or use hotels again. Of course had I know about trip advisor before my vacation I wouldn't have stayed there in the first place. The bathroom was extremely small and there was a bubble at the bottom of the tub so it was uneven. Had I had shower slippers I would have worn them. No one in our party slept on the sheets, we all brought our own blankets. There was a funky smell in the room. It was just gross and not worth the money. The only good thing I can say about this hotel is that nothing was stolen.", "Date": "July 11, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "BAKERSFIELD", "Title": "\u201cPerfectly Fine Place to Stay!\u201d", "Author": "AHAMMONS", "ReviewID": "UR3495216", "Content": "The room was clean and it had free breakfast and free shampoo, and free maid service. For $46 PER NIGHT???? In San Diego??? No complaints here. Actually, I booked the room last year sometime and all I could get for this price was a smoking room. I called a week before our trip and asked to be switched to a non-smoking room for no extra charge and the lady said that it would be taken care of. However, when we got there, we were still in the smoking room and there were not any non-smoking rooms available so we did have to suffer with that AWFUL smell, and there was a nasty cigarette burn on the side of the bathtub - but we aired out the room, sprayed lysol and lit a candle - by the time we left you wouldn't have known it was a smoking room. That was my only complaint. I would definitely stay there again!

Uh Rah-Marines! Before deciding on staying at this hotel we almost stayed at the Good Nite Inn nearby until we read the reports . This place was maybe a smidge above that. I felt uncomfortable the whole night......not comfortable enough to go in the shower without shower shoes. There was a smell in the room that seemed someone tried to heavily mask with room spray. We got a room with two queen beds upstairs and it seemed that the t.v. was in a weird positon to even watch .......not inbetween the beds as it should be but nearer to the one closest to the bathroom. In order to comfortably watch t.v. one had to pile in on one bed. The ceiling had spots on it that looked like it came from bad plumbing from above and anytime anyway left or entered a room you could hear it. When I finally climbed in bed I noticed dirt on the sheet and some unidentifiable stain. Needless to say I used a shirt that I brought as a pillow case and covered the stain with kleenex. I said my prayers went to sleep with my socks on.
