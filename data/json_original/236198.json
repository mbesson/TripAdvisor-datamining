Housekeeping only came once while we were there even after we requested it. The rooms are very small with rock hard beds and plastic drawers for you to put your clothes in. The bathroom is a totally different story. The sliding door to bathroom never worked and my husband got stuck in there a couple of times. The bathtub is really high and I slipped and bruised my knee one morning. The room in general were very uncomfortable to be in. The hotel walls are paper thin. Our first night was a Saturday night and we can hear people up and down the hallways, talking outside in the courtyard, etc. Basically we did not sleep well one night when were there.

We have previously stayed at its sister hotel the Hotel Palaceta. Although the Palaceta is much more grand the location of the Continental is far better - right on La Ramblas. From the minute we arrived which was quite late at night, until we left ,the staff were so friendly and helpful and nothing was too much trouble for them. The 24 hour buffet is great and came in handy the following day as we were tired from our travels and didnt get down to breakfast until late, which you cannot do in lots of other hotels as breakfast is usually set times. Wine and beer is on tap also 24 hours a day which was good to come back to at the end of the day or after coming in at night and wanting a nightcap. The rooms although not over big are very clean (and pink) which we knew from staying at their sister hotel. This was not a problem at any time as we only used the room for sleeping in. We had a room with a balcony overlooking La Ramblas which was great to people watch and to see the street entertainers but if you are a light sleeper i would recommend you ask for a room at the back as it is quite noisy until very late with people going past. The room is fully equipped with a free safe, microwave and a fridge to keep your drinks cool which is also an added bonus. The location is very good as the bus from the airport is just at the end of the street and the metro station is almost outside the hotel. This is our second trip to Barcelona and we will definitely be back. It is a great city with lots to see and do and the food is just delicious.

It also was not noisy even though it was on Las Ramblas. The wi-fi works even though it was a bit slow in the room (but hey, it's free, so no complaints here!). The food was good & varied and really is available all the time. Look at the website - the pictures and descriptions are right on. What really made this hotel & The Hotel Palacette stand out was the staff who are extremely helpful and speak excellent English. See my review on The Palecette for more on the excellent staff who went above and beyond to accommodate us. Of the two hotels I preferred The Continental because of the location & the balcony. The Palacette is not that far away and has much plusher surroundings although the rooms are similar to The Continental as well as the food available, etc. TIP: The A1 Bus from the airport is extremely convenient (we used it several times), inexpensive, easy to use, & drops you off right in the Placa de Catalunya which is about 5 mins. walk to The Continental. When you get off the bus, Les Rambles/Las Ramblas/The Ramblas (Catalan, Spanish, & English respectively) is almost diagonally from you if you turn to your right. So go to your right off of the bus & walk to the end of the block (one of the corners of the Placa), & cross the street.

There wasn't a tub or a shower exactly...there was a shower head with hose and a shower floor with a small rim around the bottom but strangely now shower curtain?

Also if you get a lower level balcony room the noise from La Rambas is difficult (I slept through it by my wife did not).

The price was right (117 E for a balcony room overlooking Las Ramblas), but not so sure about staying there again. First, every single surface in the rooms is covered in PINK! The drawers consisted of stackable plastic bins, and the room was extremely cluttered by 2 chairs, a small round table, 2 square platforms (for suitcases?), a wardrobe for hanging clothes, etc. Each room features a microwave, small fridge and safe, along with hair dryer, all nice amenities. TV was a flat screen mounted up near the ceiling. Balcony had 2 nice chairs and a table - all good for overlooking the action along Las Ramblas while writing postcards. The main attractions for us were the location, price, and promise of free 24-hour food buffet items along with beer/wine. The food offerings were pretty unappetizing, and looked like they had been left out for a while. They did offer soft-serve ice cream with a variety of syrup toppings, and excellent coffee & cappicino from a machine. Noise from Las Ramblas made sleeping almost impossible. People were partying at all hours of the night. Others in our group had non-balcony rooms (less expensive at 87 E/night) but reported no views from their windows at all. Someone was almost pickpocketed in the hotel's street level foyer. On the plus side, the hotel is 1/2 block from the Aerobus stop at Placa Catalunya, and a short walk from La Boqueria Market (where someone else in our party was pickpocketed). The staff was friendly and helpful. The lobby balcony was another good people-watching spot to hang out in, and there was a small patio off the buffet area.

We were doing a cruise that started in Barcelona so we got to the city a day early to check it out. We had a fantastic time and I would highly recommend traveling to Barcelona. This hotel was perfect for us. Location and price were our two main criteria with a big emphasis on location. The hotel is located right at the top of Las Ramblas, which is the main pedestrian street with all the action. Pay up the extra $10-$20 for a room with a view of Las Ramblas, it's well worth it as long as you don't mind the noise from the hustle and bustle. I read a few other reviews that said the noise was a problem, but it didn't bother us and we're pretty light sleepers. The hotel is located right by a metro stop making it extremely convienent when traveling from the airport. We never took a taxi and used the very modern metro system the whole time. The top of Las Ramblas where the hotel is located as opposed to the other end by the sea is also a lot safer a night. The rooms themselves were not anything special. Do not stay here if you are looking for a 5 star hotel with a spa. The mattresses were firm, but more comfortable than the hotel we stayed at in Paris. The bathroom was actually pretty spacious compared to other hotel bathrooms in Europe. You will get a kick out of the light switches (by the way, you have to put your key into a place with the light switches in order for the electricity to work, also you have to have the balcony window closed if you want the A/C to work, very much about energy conservation). This is definitely a small traditional hotel you would expect to find in Europe, however it had the feel of a B&B with the friendly staff and the 24 hour food and drink buffet. The wine was just a house wine but the beer was pretty good. The hotel has free internet access which is a rarity in Europe. The manager at the front desk was British so it helped we could speak to him in English. We also had a situation where we had to check out in the morning but our cruise didn't leave until that evening. We were able to store our luggage in a storage room at the hotel so that we could explore the city a little more. As long as you're not looking for luxuory, I highly recommend this hotel. It served as a perfect homebase to see Barcelona. A couple tips about the city: If you like trying new foods, you should fnd a restaurant/bar that serves pinxtos. They usually consist of a small piece of bread with some sort of meat or fish on top of it along with a cheese, sauce, or something else with a toothpick holding them together. The fun part is that there are plates filled with different types of pinxtos all along the bar and you just grab a plate and help yourself. You pay based on how many toothpicks you have left over. They were relativily cheap at a euro and change so we were able to try a lot of different foods at one time without breaking the pocket book. I would say rioja is the wine of choice there, and the glasse I had were very good and affordable (2-3 euros for a glass). Lastly, in case you are heading on a cruise: A taxi can take you right to your cruise ship, however taxi's are definitely your most expensive option. You can take the metro from the hotel down to the mouth of the port at the bottom of Las Ramblas (or you could walk it, probably 3/4 of a mile), and then take the \"blue\" bus to the actual cruise ships. There is no sign for the blue bus or labeling of the bus itself, but it is the color blue so that's how you know which one you want. There will also be a relatively long line of people with luggage waiting for it. The bustop is just NE of the big Columbus statue. Have a great time on your trip, enjoy the city, there's plenty to see in way of art, cathedrals, and culture. The food was very good there, however there's probably less English spoken in Barcelona than other European cities. Brush up on your Spanish, but be aware that they actually speak Catalunyan there (I would say it's a Spanish-French hybrid).", "Date": "February 24, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cCozy in Barcelona\u201d", "Author": "starcitydee", "ReviewID": "UR54597602", "Content": "Reasonably priced.

There are two free internet computers (one by reception and the other on the second floor). Peter, the receptionist is fantastic. This hotel is owned by the same people as the Continental Palacete and there are a lot of similarities between these hotels. Of the two, I actually prefer this one. It is a bit cheaper, is right on the Ramblas, has draft beer (rather than cans) and has an ice cream machine! The hotel shares an entrance with two other hotels and there is a common elevator that often seems to break down. There are 57 steps to climb if it does -and it did! For E77 per night, it is excellent value and of the the 5 different hotels I have stayed at in Barcelona, this is the one that I will certainly try to come to next time. My room was at the back of the hotel where it was very quiet.

Bought different antihistamine creams and cortisone cream in Dubrovnik, now spent about $50 on meds. We saw no evidence of any bugs or blood on the cruise ship and hubby was't effected. Well the last 6 days of my cruise were not fun with the itching and rash but pills and liberal application of the cortisone gave me bits of relief When I returned home I went to the doctor who said yes, it was a bed bug bite and the subsequent rash was from it. UGH!! Seems the saliva of the bed bug causes an allergic reaction and causes the rash which spreads from scratching. I emailed the hotel and they were rude and dismissive, I am a travel agent and will never put anyone in here again (used them quite frequently before this), not because of the bugs, (5 stars have had them) but because of their nasty attitude when I notified them.

BTW the hotel shares the entrance with 2 other hotels of lower class. So no one looks after this entrance and you can easily find a tramp sleeping downstairs or somewhere near the lift.

Fab location in the center of town, La Rambla. Street theatre crazy markets selling chickens and all sorts. Yes the rooms are dated in decor and gave us many laughs as we giggled about the wall papered walls/lampshades & fans but we loved it there. Its central location makes it great for shopping and eating out. Make sure your back by 8-8.30. do as the energy changes and becomes unsafe after that time watch your bags at all times and treat it like central london. i was luck to have a great guide book with maps (Eyewitness Travel top 10 barcelona) got it off ebay for \u00a35 invaluable! and it made our trip, planning the day before, what we would do the next day. Trains are so easy to work out if you get a map from Tourist information located in huge square on right of this hotel they will help you plan your trip. We didnt bother with the tourist buses for 21 euros a day we just jumped on the trains for 1.35 euros each way and weaved our way round using our map. Dont get ripped off eating on the rambla in the tappas bars find a recommended restuarant in your guide or try, la fresca theres a few around where you can eat all you like for 7.95 euros each (lunchtime- 9.99 euros in the evening) salad, soups, pasta,pizza,chicken, icecream,cake,drinks, loved it. Anyway back to the hotel dont get too excited about the buffet but the on tap beer/wine/fizzies/teas/coffees/water is a bonus to the hotel. Toast and cakes ok but not to our taste we prefered to go to the famous fruit/veg/meat market ( mercat de boqueria -left outside hotel & opposite) you can miss it so ask at reception. they sell a wide range of fruit smoothies for a euro fab energy boost for the day. The staff at the hotel were helpful, the rooms clean and comfortable the beds very comfy if you prefer a firmer mattress, we did. some say their rooms was small but ours was just right. We loved it and its true, all we want to do now is go back. Computor in lobby shared by the guests, internet connection in each room, fridge, microwave,hairdryer. Clean towels toilet roll each day. All the little extras made our stay a pleasant one. Surperb location, great value in an expensive city. Highly recommended. Oh yes lastly turn right out of hotel and walk straight up onto Rambla de catalunya. walk straight for a good half a mile and number 102 Mauri is the name- its on the right and is the best cake shop in town where you can sit and drink tea and eat sanwiches with the crusts off with the very rich. Our bill was 11 euros for two exquisite cakes, a pot of earl grey and a cappicino, worth every penny was a real treat. A wonderful experience and the shops that line the streets as you walk allow your mind to enter into another world. you,ll need the walk back to burn off the calories.

We had booked a room with a balcony overlooking Las Ramblas for two nights after our 21 day Med cruise. What a great choice!! After 21 days on a cruiseship we were perfectly contented to just eat the food at the hotel's 24/7 buffet, which we hear has been expanded in recent months. Before the cruise we had two days and tried local restaurants, tapas, etc. At the Hotel Continental there was always crereal, bread, cookies, dried and fresh fruit, peanuts, walnuts and soft serve ice milk with 3 topping choices! (DH especially LOVED this as he thinks ice cream is one of the main food groups!!) They also had soda, orange juice, white and rosa wine and beer available free 24/7 too, along with coffee, hot tea and cappachino!!! AND I saw hard boiled eggs every time I checked the buffet. Also a salad bar with lettuce, cheese, tomatoes, olives, green peppers, and oil and vinegar for dressing - and surely some things I missed listing. Oh yea, they had some kind of cold reddish fish on it that I once accidentally thought was another bin of tomatoes!! They also had some hot dishes like paella (rice with veggies), some delicious white fish from time to time, veggies, and a potato stew. Even a nice ham pasta salad that was very tasty! Variety stayed fairly constant, too, though better when there was someone there actually preparing and cooking. We were VERY impressed, and found out that the eating facilities had been recently moved from a higher floor to the brand new reception area where there is a front breakfast room and a back (by the drink and ice milk machines) two row seating area. You could also use a back way up yo your floor and not have to go through the automatic doors each and every time. It took a bit of ingenuity to figure out how to do this (you go through the old empty breakfast area), but we liked this way to and from the reception area. The free internet access after the exhorbitant costs on the cruise ship was WONDERFUL! They have one computer by the food place that we got to use several times! Our room had a nice hard bed that was good for our backs, and a newly installed automatic black out shade over the glass doors to the balcony. Really cut our any light from Las Ramblas plus cut down on noise. Nice addition! Very clean \"pink\" room and bath. We enjoyed our stay there IMMENSELY, especiallyy sitting out on our balcony at night with a glass of wine and \"people watching\"! We used the convenient Aero bus to get to the airport on the morning we had to leave.

The set up is quite strange in that there are three hotels in the one block (like a converted apartment block). Floor 2 is Hotel Continental.

The staff were polite, but quite standoffish. No one showed us to our room, we were given a key and told - down the corridor to your left. The couple behind us were then checked in. The room was small. The size of a standard master bedroom, same with the ensuite. The room was clean. However the decor (pink walls, pink ceiling (!), pink bedspread, dark carpet, dark curtain and cream net curtain) was definately outdated. The balcony was small but had a terrific view of La Ramblas - the main street in the area. The all day breakfast (included in the price) was a great bonus, and there was a generous selection of food. The location of this hotel was what drew me to it. Directly on La Ramblas, you are at the heart of hustle and bustle of the city. The marina to you left (approx 5 minute walk), and a bus tour centre location to your right (approx 2 minute walk). There is a great pizzaria next door to the hotel, and the hard rock caf\u00e9 is out of the hotel, follow the road to the right, and right again (opposite the fountains) - approx 2 mins away.

Anyway,this was a treat for me as i was on holiday on my own,leaving husband and 2 small children at home,so it was a much needed break!!We checked in at about 10.30 pm and were given our keys and instructions to our in room safes,my room wasnt a bad size,queen bed and a nice bathroom,however,from the minute i walked into my room i noticed a really horrible false smell,if you know what i mean,i dont know if it was the a.c but it was not nice,and sooo strong.Anyway,one of my friends was upstairs and her room was much bigger than mine! and my other friends room was the smallest,it was very small,but neither of theirs had the horrible smell that i had.So,we put our bags in and went straight out,i was really shocked at how busy it was,we had been warned about pick pockets and kept our bags tight to our bodies,i did feel a little unsafe to begin with but soon got used to it.There are some great restaraunts nearby,some that were stupidly expensive and some very reasonable,on the whole eating and drinking was much cheaper than i thought it would have been.Hard rock cafe,tour buses and shops just round corner,so the location was perfect.Also i must tell you and you must go,we were desperate to see real Flamenco and considdered going to the restaraunt over the road,cant remember the name,but it was something ridiculouse like 90 euros for dinner and show which we thought was too much,we asked at the reception of the hotel who were extremely helpfull and directed us to Las Tarantos,i think it was in the plaza(great big square 5 minutes walk away with loads of restaraunts and bars etc).Anyway,the show started at 8 i think but we were told to arrive early which we did.The place itself was very tucked away,we had been sitting opposite it the night before and hadnt realised it was there!!!But it was beautifull,vrrrery small and dark with little round tables and Gaudi style seating areas,you get the picture!!!It was lovely.The show was just fantastic and at 6 euros,you cant knock,but i cant tell you enough how fantastic it was,it was breathtaking,no touristy stuff,just proper flamenco with fantastic music and singing,my friends and i went for pizza after and loved it that much that we went in again for the last show,its even cheeper second time round at 4 euros!!!Anyway,im getting eye ache now,but the hotels location was good and the buffet was very handy and staff very helpfull,as mentioned by someone else,the hallways are pretty bad,just dont look down and spry lots of perfume in your room!!!For the price we paid it was very good and easy for sightseeing,but you must make sure you go to Las Tarantos,it made our holiday!!!Ive since found out it is the oldest Flamenco bar in Barcelona....that explains everything!!!", "Date": "April 14, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "brussels", "Title": "\u201cBring earplugs and wear a blind-fold\u201d", "Author": "sunfunmom", "ReviewID": "UR14682596", "Content": "We picked this hotel based on Rick Steve's review in his Spain 2008 book.

We ended up staying the entire week because we couldn't find another affordable hotel (we paid 122 euros a night and the other hotels were quoting 200+ euros/nt). The location is excellent.

Turns out the hotel have a policy of maximum allowable number of people in one room - but was resolved, and we were helped by adding a mattress. With the price we're paying, we expected a teeny-tiny room with a broomcloset-like bathroom/shower as with other hotels in Europe. I braced myself for having to do acrobatic tricks while taking a shower to cope with the cramped quarters. The room was quite small but not as small as the ones we had in London hotels with the same price, and found - surprise, surprise! - a (small) full bathroom with bathtub, that even have a bidet! It's true that the decors are too pinkish and \"flowery\" for my taste but who wants to stay in their hotel room and stare at the wall for too long in lively Barcelona? Furnitures are cloth covered plastic - but we only use them to dump our backpacks on when we were sleeping anyway! We opted for a room overlooking the Ramblas and we're glad we did. The view was magnificent and if you want you can stay for hours looking at the passing crowd and street performers below. Locations is everything for a hotel. Continental Barcelona is at the North end of Las Ramblas, only a few yards away from Plaza Catalunya, Barri Gothic, Metro, El Corte Ingles Dept. Store, Carreour Express, the stop for Barcelona Tour Bus and endless shops along Las Ramblas. Hard Rock Cafe and Starbucks is just around the corner so this one has a perfect location to start your adventure in Barcelona! Being family with children, we love the convenience of having the 24 hour snack and drinks at the hotel. No more rushing to the supermarket for evening milk for the kids while we were there! On Christmas day they even handed out free champagne for guests! The staff are very friendly, polite and helpful and they will go out of their way to make things work for you. Cristina, Peter and others at the front desk will make sure you have all that you need, and help out with enquiries on what to see and where to go in the city, even handed out the brochures for some of the local attractions.

The reality.... -The rooms were tiny -The rooms were worn and out-dated -The furniture pieces were plastic rubbermaid organizers with a metal sheet on top to create a table. -The bathroom was a little moldy and the cold water was not coming into the shower on the first night. The bathroom itself is bad enough, but the fact that I had to bathe in boiling water is ridiculous. -There were two small towels and two bath towels. No hand towels, tub mat, washcloth or anything of the sort. -Couldn't turn off the heater, so we opted for regulating the temperature with the amount of air coming in from the window -The bed was hard as a rock -The pigeons outside our window would not let us sleep -Getting the toilet to flush toilet paper was a 1/2 hour ordeal -The key was attached to a ruler, so everyone would leave their keys at the front desk in order not to have to carry the thing all day -The maid smelled so bad you could smell her all the way down the hall and around the corner.

Discolored old blankets and beds made one worry about sleeping in them. The breakfast bar was disgusting, stale. We had to go and spend more money buying breakfast outside.

The Hotel reception is on the second floor of the building and can be reached by a small elevator which didn't smell too fresh. The reception area is a little shabby, but the staff are very friendly. Our room was just off the reception area and although we'd read about the outdated decor on this site, it really did come as a shock. George Orwell is said to have stayed here in the 30's - well, it looks like he picked the wallpaper and carpets because they've got to be that old at least. Despite being a balcony room with window over La Rambla, it was dark and dreary with a very musty smell. The bathroom also smelled quite badly and we discussed the idea of walking straight out and finding another hotel. We decided to stay and I have to say that after a while we did get used to the decor and once the room was aired it was quite comfortable and clean. Obviously we were prepared to deal with the noise of La Rambla, and this was reduced to a murmur when the balcony doors were closed, but noise within the hotel was bothersome at times because of the thin walls. Noise from the dining area which adjoined our room wasn't a problem, but the resident dog's barking at times through the night was. It's a big dog with a big bark and would be a problem for light sleepers. The worst noise problem became apparent when a couple moved in to the room next door on our last night. Let's just say that they enjoyed themselves frequently and loudly, and we were spared none of the details between banging headboards, enthusiastic vocalisations and creaking bedsprings. This means that the hotel might not give you the privacy required if you want to either be shielded from the shenannigans of others or get up to your own. Although the hotel has some serious negative aspects, there are some very good points which made our stay there very enjoyable despite the bad points. First and foremost is the location which simply couldn't be better. Placa de Catalunya, the hub of the city, is only a few yards away with the Hard Rock Cafe, Corte Ingles and the Metro station within a minute or two's walk. Being able to make a convenient pitstop at your hotel from running round the city all day is a huge advantage. Then, of course, there's La Rambla itself with all it has to offer. The other major plus point is having the balcony room. It was so good to sit with a cold beer or two at the end of a hectic day and watch La Rambla going about its business. The provision of a buffet and the chill cabinet full of reasonably priced beer are also nice touches. On balance, I don't think the Hotel Continental was particularly good value for money. While certainly not the most expensive hotel, the Ramblas rooms aren't bargains either. If the hotel were in any other location it would be horribly over priced given its antiquated decor and limited facilities. The Hotel Cortes, which is just around the corner, has almost as good a location with a much better environment and at a better price. There are any number of hotels nearby that would be better quality at a lower price. I guess it just depends how much that balcony on La Ramblas is worth to you. For us, it just about made it worthwhile putting up with the negatives.", "Date": "October 10, 2004"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Continental Barcelona", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d236198-Reviews-Hotel_Continental_Barcelona-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "Price": "$121 - $214*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Rambla de Canaletets, 138</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">08002</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Barcelona</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Spain</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "236198", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/01/bc/5e/9b/balcony-ramblas.jpg"}}
