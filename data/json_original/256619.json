The ONLY positive is the location but there are plenty of other centrally located hotels to choose from. Check-in took forever, we then had to lift our suitcases up 3 or 4 steps to get to the extremely small landing to get an elevator. No porter service at all. We stayed on the 15th floor in a room that was the smallest I have ever stayed in and we've travelled around the world. The room had a soft spongy queen bed and a single bed for our son. My husband complained there was a lump on his side of the bed, well upon stripping the bed linen off we found a large folded cloth sitting on top of the mattress, obviously left there to soak something up from the mattress (!!!!!!) or accidently left by cleaning staff which is very hard to believe. The room had only two low watt ceiling lights which weren't even over the bed so none of us could read in bed as the room was SO dark. I didn't even have a bed-side table. The bathroom could accomodate only one small person at a time, it was the smallest I have ever seen. The soap dispenser fell off the wall when pressed, the shower was marginal and the toilet and sink stained due to age. There is no restaurant in the Park Regis, no bar, no mini bar in rooms, no chilled water in the fridge and the fridge was empty. We paid NZD$275 per night for a standard room and felt absolutely ripped off. We checked out the next morning and checked into the Jamison Amora which is a wonderful hotel and cost us only a few dollars more. There is NO comparison. We will NEVER return to Park Regis and could hardly wait to leave the place. It should be re-named to Park Regis Back Packers and the rate should be 1 third of what we paid.", "Date": "April 16, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Auckland", "Title": "\u201creasonable for the price, great location\u201d", "Author": "kiwicanfly73", "ReviewID": "UR127686572", "Content": "We choose the hotel for the location and price, the room was clean, serviced well and reasonably sized given the city location.

Having read the previous reviews, I will admit I was a bit apprehensive, but I had no issues at all at the Park Regis. I reviewed lots of hotels in the CBD, and decided to pick the Park Regis because of #1 - the location, and #2- the price, which I found entirely reasonable. I arrived at the hotel about 1/2 hour before check in time, but was advised by the very friendly lady at reception that my room was ready. She reviewed the hotel policies with me, which were all pretty standard, and made sure I had the info I needed to use the elevators. I was pleasantly surprised when I entered my room - it was spic and span clean. I had no troubles with the TV, or the noise from the street. I guess when I am staying in the very heart of a vibrant international city, I expect to hear noise (and in all honesty, the noise was quieter at the Park Regis from the ninth floor than it was when I stayed in Manhattan, and I was not expecting that at all!) The bed and the pillows were clean and comfy, and both nights I had a great sleep. Yes, the bathroom is small, but I wasn't looking at buying the place - and I came to Sydney to see Syndey, not stay in my hotel room or the bathroom! I had no issue with the condition of the bathroom, the towels, or the pressure in the shower. The location of the Park Regis is FANTASTIC! There is a Subway (the fast food restaurant) right next door on one side, and a coffee shop right next door on the other side. There is a Starbucks within 1/2 block on the same side of the street, a Macdonalds within 1/2 block on the other side of the street, and a Woolworths only a one minute walk on the next block over on the same side of the street. The room had a small fridge in it, which thrilled me - I walked to the Woolworths and stocked up on things like water which cost 4 times more elsewhere. Plus, it was nice to have healthy snacks on hand (like being able to pull strawberries out of the fridge!) and seeing as the hotel provided milk and a kettle, I was able to have a cuppa at any point without having to get dressed and go out! Circular Quay is a 15-20 minute walk from the hotel (although be prepared as it takes longer to walk back as the walk back is mostly uphill). Town Hall is within one block, as is the major newly renovated shopping mall (Westfields if I recall correctly). Once I was in the CBD, I did not use a cab once. There is a free transit bus #555 that runs on Elizabeth Street (one block over) from Central Station to Circular Quay regularly. I thought the staff working at reception were lovely - any time I dealt with them they were friendly and efficient. I booked a return shuttle at the airport upon my arrival in Sydney which required a 24 hour notice of pickup time for shuttle back to airport from the hotel - when I asked the fellow at reception if he could help me do that, he was fantastic. There is also a map available at reception which I found very helpful, along with the information the staff at reception gave me.

The rooms were very small and very outdated, there was mould on the bathroom floor and the beds were extremely uncomfortable, the air conditioning had minimal settings so basically it was either on full or off!! not good if you just want light cooling in your room, our key card randomly stopped working on our last night and we had to go down to reception to fix, might I add there was no apology just a swipe and a few taps of the keyboard to get it going. Internet is expensive for wireless connection and the internet in the lobby is $2.50 for 15 minutes, youll even get an unreliable computer that freezes how awesome right?? The house keeping staff barely speak a word of English and use the guest elevators for their laundry service tubs so if your in their way you better move. You need to slam the doors when going out to get them to actually shut, this made me a little concerned as I thought i may wake other guests.

We actually chose the place because the manager responded to feedback on here and we thought that showed respect for patrons and figured we had so much crammed into this one weekend that we would literally only shower and sleep there, so it couldn't be that bad. Man were we wrong! Room was liveable, pretty shabby, but not unhygienic, but probably on par for the usual room rates. I believe looking at the rates now, compared to what we paid, that our rates were jacked up due to the demand for that weekend. The hot water takes ages to heat (probably 20 seconds) and the channel selection on the tv was terrible - all I wanted to see was some Australian News coverage and all I could get was BBC UK! Couldn't even get Sunrise / Today and co, let alone fox news! Location was ok for what we wanted, but it depends where you're planning to go. Worst part was definitely the housekeeping and management. The hallway was filled with the smell of marijuana, and the staff on the desk never appeared interested when it was raised. Rooms weren't made up until late afternoon, which was irritating as the towels are so thin they are saturated after one use, so you throw them on the floor to get changed, come back wanted to shower before dinner and still don't have fresh towels! Worst of all, as I flew straight from work I had my iPad with me. As it was WiFi only it stayed in the room the whole time. We arrived at the hotel at around midnight Friday night and I put it on charge on the desk in the room. Got up early Saturday morning and we were out all day, stopping in for a few 30min - 1 hour blocks and not getting back until probably 1am, the same for the next few days and nights as well. When packing to leave we noticed the iPad was gone, we searched everywhere, nowhere to be found, so we reported it to the front desk and I have never been poorly treated by hotel staff in my life. There was a young man and a woman at the counter and I spoke with the man, advised what had happened and the woman, who was midway through serving another customer started shaking her head and rolling her eyes as I spoke. I asked her if she was alright and she began interrogating us about what we had said asking us rapid fire questions until she became so enraged by our consistent answers that she just barked at us about us not yet reporting it to the police. I explained to the woman that we felt it best, since it was stolen from our locked room and there had been no one in our room but us and their staff, we felt it best to talk to them first, and of course, I wouldn't have had the first clue about the Police station closest to us. I asked them to review their records to see who had been in the room she just said 'yeah we'll get right on that' and laughed. Luckily, the man agreed he would 'look into' it and promised to be there at 4pm to discuss. Upon returning at 4, of course he was no where to be found, and the receptionist tells me he was only rostered until 2! Lucky me, angry woman from the morning was there and I asked her to organise for the manager to call me and explained that we had been to the police and reported it, she started asking for the name of the officer I'd reported it to and I explained that the officers in the station put me on the phone to the reports line, she laughed at me. Next she asked where my 'police card' was and when I said I wasn't sure what she meant she just rolled her eyes. The look of shock as I read the police report number to her out of my phone was priceless, however. Anyway, no call from the manager, so I called them, he said he'd investigate and call back and never did, so I called again and he said he'd asked the staff who said they didn't take it... Gee because they'd admit that, as long as you ask nicely! He then tells me he isn't actually the Manager, he just manages the desk and that the real manager would have to review it to decide if they will accept any liability, wanted any further evidence, ask further questions etc. so I ask when will I hear from him? No... He won't call you, you have to write him a letter! FFS! So I have written him a letter 6 weeks ago, I included a signed statement from myself and my partner about our versions, a statement from the friend who picked us up from the airport who saw me using the iPad to get the address for the hotel, i provided a copy of the original purchase information, a photocopy of the box with the serial number on it and confirmation that I had wiped and locked the iPad. No response, not even an acknowledgement, By the time I'd finally got everything together to send down I'd already replaced the iPad anyway, but it was more the principle, that I hadn't been considered. There are signs in the room saying that if there is a noise complaint they will bill the offender the amount equal to the compensation they pay the complainer (or something to that effect) the fact they would compensate a person for making a noise complaint, but not even acknowledge my complaint is ridiculous. I understand that there are dodgy people out there who probably try to rip them off, but if that was the case, why would I supply proof I owned it, statements from people who saw me with it, and if I still had it, why would I block and lock it!

It is overpriced, the rooms are incredibly small, also the hallways are extremely small and there were unpleasant smells when I went up to my room. The hotel pool on the roof is kind of nice but pretty useless, I don't think anybody actually uses it. When I went up there to go for a swim in the next morning after my arrival, there were lots of huge dead bugs and insects swimming in the pool, also some food and a newspaper, so obviously nobody takes care of the pool or cleans it (at least this was my experience). I felt disgusted and didn't go into the water. Also, \"pool\" is a bit overdone, it is more like a larger bathtub, you cannot really swim, because, after one stroke you've crossed the whole \"pool\" already. This \"pool\" is probably only installed there to earn more hotel stars or for promotion reasons, but it is actually pretty useless and a bit disgusting. The hotel is not nicely decorated in the interior, the floor carpet looks very cheap, the rooms are extremely basic and VERY small, almost like in a backpackers hostel. There was lots of dust and dirt in the room, I didn't even have space to store away my luggage, and in the bathroom there where fungi on the tiles - DISGUSTING! This hotel is like a better backpacker's hostel but definitely does not have the quality of a a good, decent hotel. I was very disappointed and found the hotel WAY OVERPRICED, considering the quality of the room I had (7th floor with no view at all but to the wall of the neighboring building). Maybe top level rooms are nicer, but that's not the point here, because EVERY room has to meet minimal standards in a hotel when they charge that much for it. The reason why I finally only give one point (=not acceptable) for this disappointing joint is the extremely unfriendliness of staff when I arrived after a 22 hour flight from Europe at around midnight. The clerk at the front was just an idiot, bossing me around and acting in an aggressive manner when I was asking for a better (and, of course, much more expensive and also overpriced) room. I couldn't get another room because, allegedly, the were booked out. Although I had credit card reservation, he said, they thought I would not arrive and that they would have given away my room to the next customer, so I should consider myself lucky to still have a room. WHAT AN IMPUDENCE !!!!! - such an idiot. I've been traveling all around the world, but such a cretin I've never had to greet me at a hotel front desk!! I acknowledge that the clerks on the next days were more friendly and helpful, so you could say, I had bad luck with that person, but I think, such a socially incompetent person should NEVER be in charge at the front desk to begin with. Because of that experience and the overall very bad, disappointing impression this hotel made on me, I can only give one point. The ONLY advantage of this hotel is its convenient location near to downtown, in the middle of business district, but that's all and that is not worth the overpriced rates there. In particular, when I'm on business travel, it is important for me to have a good experience at my hotel, which wasn't the case here at all. I recommend spending even more money for one of the other probably similar overpriced hotels in that area but having a probably much nicer experience and getting more value for your money. All in all I cannot at all recommend this hotel.

This is my first stay at this hotel and would only stay here again if out of options, which was how I ended up booking into this hotel in the first place (late in organising accoomodation in Sydney for a large international conference). In defence of the hotel, there is a price difference of $300+ dollars per night difference comparied to where I would normally stay, for the period I stayed (price hike due to shortage during the conference). Given the same scenario of late booking and significant (200-300%) price hike at the other hotels I would not hesitate to book this hotel again if there wre no other options. Pros - location. Center of the CBD and close to the monorail. This was for a conference at Darling Harbour. Using the monorail, over a week it never took more than 15min from leaving my room to arriving into the exhibition hall at the Convention Centre; many restaurants nearby; near the Town Hall train station - Comfortable bed. - Internet. Reasonably priced internet with reasonable speed (tested via Speedtest.net: 1.45Mbps upload; .13Mbps upload); Starting at $7:50/hr. Also offers a range of access options to total time (I bought 8 hrs for $30, which was sufficient as I only needed a couple of hours per night) which only counts the time one is online, to blanket full day to multiday access. Cons - Rooms are small (see photo .... the photo of the room was taken right at the corner of the room with an iphone and could not capture much of the bed) - Noisy. Very poor sound insulations from the street (at least when on the 11th floor) Sounds from every car, street sweeper, bus, mono-rail, fire trucks, police cars, etc is heard all through the night - Sydney streets are not quiet in the middle of the night. - Very poor temperature control - see photo. No temperature adjustements, just a fan speed adjustment for the air-con. I found the room to range from cool to too cold.

But there are many negatives about this hotel that mean its not top of my list when visiting Sydney - its very much a place I stay only when my favourites aren't available. The negatives start with check-in. Once I finally had the clerk's attention he checked me in and advised that they took payment for the room up front. OK. And they charge a fee for using a credit card - so either go out and find some cash or pay more. Credit cards are the way the world pays when travelling and this practice of charging extra to use credit cards stinks, and it is becoming more widespread. While waiting for the clerk's undivided attention I also noticed the hotel now charges $2 per bag to hold your luggage after checkout. This is something I haven't encountered before, I have always found hotels happy to store your bags if you are not planning to travel until some time after checkout. The vibe I was picking up continued when I got to my room. The room itself was comfortable if somewhat dated - the hotel was one of the earlier additions to Sydney back in the 60s and 70s when more modern hotels started to open. Standard room furniture included queen bed, wardrobe, easy chair, fridge, and a desk/bench with chair. The desk was covered in promotional material trying to get me to spend more - internet, city attractions and the like - lots of those three sided free standing thingys, there were even a couple on my bedside table. I had to put them all in the drawer to make room to actually use the desk. As I said it continued what I felt was a pattern of trying to get whatever they could out of me. The room, being dated, was actually quite noisy despite being on the twelfth floor. But the noise was not just from traffic down below. Being an early riser and early to bed I reckon I clearly heard every other guest on my floor return to their rooms throughout each night I was there. Some of them were probably a bit louder than they should have been but it wasn't like the guests were partying or anything. Lighting in the room was poor, not really enough to be able to read in bed, or not for me anyway.

Check in was a breeze, the staff were very nice indeed. We opted to pay $35 for onsite parking, and were lucky to get a spot as December in downtown Sydney is just mental. The hotel is in a perfect spot, right in the middle of town and pretty much in walking distance to everywhere. We had a party to attend at Circular Quay and, though it's about 2kms we walked there in no time at all. Expect to hear some traffic noise. It is, after all, a major city and there are always cars about, no matter the hour. A lot of people have said the rooms are miniscule. These travelers have obviously never stayed in a major city like Tokyo or New York, where you can practically brush your teeth without leaving your bed! A lot of big cities have hotels just like this one - an old building (opened circa 1960) with small rooms that have been renovated. The room was clean, with nice, modern decor and a very comfy bed, great flat screen and high-speed broadband. I didn't find it small - there was even the surprise of a 2nd single bed in addition to our king size bed. We were supplied plenty of linen and towels, spare pillows, and blankets. I was happy to see there was a little bar fridge, as so many hotels have now taken them out to save on electricity costs. It was stocked with milk for tea and coffee, which was welcomed in the morning. There was a sign in the shower saying that water pressure may be an issue, but as we were on the 6th floor this wasn't a problem at all. The bathroom is small, but who cares if you are there for one or two nights. The check-in staff said we could pay in the morning, but as an experienced traveller I opted to pay upon checking in (thus avoiding the mad rush at 10am on Sunday). It was a smart move, the lobby was packed in the morning. We just popped our key into the express box, had breakfast next door at The Coffee Club, and then left the hotel with no dramas at all. I recommend this hotel as it's good value, a great location, and the staff were very friendly and efficient. Don't stay here if you are used to enormous rooms with no sound of traffic.

Checkin was fairly quick. However when we arrived at Room 1706, not only was a towel propping open the bar fridge (perhaps due to water leakage), but disconcertingly the bathroom light was inoperable. We went back down to reception: the male staff member immediately offered us an identical room several floors down. We stayed at the hotel on two non-consecutive nights. Friday night was marred by near constant street noise from Park Street, ranging from the usual drunks through to the 0400 bottle collection truck and the 0530 City of Sydney mechanised street sweeper. While not the hotel's fault, the building's former status as the 1968-opened Koala Motel means (or perhaps is an excuse for) the owner not having gone to the expense of double glazing. The airconditioning was quiet: the first bathroom in room 907 that we used had some dirty grout: teh second room (1006) had a spotless, near identical bathroom. Bothn had deterioration around windowsills: in one, it appeared that water from the ancient Dux water 'instantaneous' (actually after running the hot tap for as much as 45 second) hot water and its cold water counterpart was able to find its way behind the tiles. I am no building expert but this cannot be good. The shower and vanity basin both had the old-style palm of hand-controlled dispeners for shaving cream, body lotion, shampoo and conditioner. I last saw these in some reasonably remote Australian country motels. The bathroom tiles were not particularly safe when wet (although not the worst that I have seen). While both beds were comfortable and the properly laundered linen of excellent quality, both rooms only had one bedside table. Lighting in the bedroom was poor, while the psotioning of the power points meant it was hard to connect an IPod charger, the design of which is bulky. A little more thought might have raised the power points two or three centimetres. A good supply of tea, coffee and sugar was on hand while the hotel deserves credit for having installed plasma televisions, albeit with a pretty poor selectrion of channels that compares extremely poorly with the standard offering in say Manila or Singapore CBD hotels. I did not have breakfast on site, but used the expensive Internet ($2.50 for 15 minutes). It was unimpressive to have to pay $2 per stored luggage item. While the object of this charge might partly be to reduce the inevitable high demand that comes with anything free, it was more of an annoyance. Some guests might call it insulting! It would be nice to be able to give this hotel 2.5/5 not 2 but TA's ratings do not so allow. That said, I would avodi this hotel on Friday and probably Saturday nights as well: other nights might be as quiet as the Sunday night on which we stayed. This hotel is part of a building that as far as I know has individually owned apartments (probably suitable for students) so its chance of being demolished is low. That said, the design is (unsurprisingly) 1960s. No paint job or plasma television can make me avoid that sinking feeling that the room suggests I'm in a Moree, NSW country motel not smack bang in the middle of Sydney.", "Date": "November 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cDISGRACEFUL\u201d", "Author": "Adrianmob", "ReviewID": "UR120316747", "Content": "Shocking room.

First off, it was amazingly located. Right in the heart of the CBD, all locations I had to get to was quickly accessible, either by monorail, cab or on foot. I loved the convenience of its location. The room I had was a bit small (it looked exactly like the one in the main picture on top) but it was fabulously clean and well maintained. The workdesk wasn't one of the largest I've come across, but was adequate. Internet connectivity wasn't a problem, except that there was no wifi and you had to plug in the \"blue\" cable. The only thing I wasn't quite satisfied with was that the bathroom was extremely small and cramped: a tiny sink, tight space for latrine & teeny tiny shower (definitely no bath!) but it too was very, very clean. But I suppose you pay for what you get, and for the price, the small bathroom was a small trade-off for everything else. The service here was excellent. The staff is efficient and things get done with a minimum of fuss. Our entire team built a rather fond friendship with the night manager, Craig, who processed our 3am check-in efficiently and with just the right touch of dry, sarcastic humour. For those looking for a single-occupancy, fuss-free, easy & comfortable place to stay on your business trip, I'd definitely recommend the Park Regis City Centre. For those travelling in larger parties, especially families with young children, perhaps this isn't quite the place for you.

There is also a small swimming pool. -Good laundry facility. Also on the top floor is a coin-operated laundry room with plenty of good quality washers and dryers. I found this very handy as I ended up doing several loads of laundry. You can buy detergent from the front-desk. Cons: -the room itself was fairly small, and felt a little cramped. -the windows are single paned, and there was no screen.

Our 6th floor room was bleak, walls and skirting boards marked and dirty, the air con extremely noisy and not working, the room was small and the en-suite even smaller, the beds were really hard and lumpy, the lamp insufficient and dusty, the window small and high with a view of nothing but a small car park, the hair dryer quickly stopped working until it cooled down again, etc. The corridors were really narrow and everything felt neglected and very basic. None of the images on the website looked at all like our room. On our way out, I mentioned to another receptionist that the air con didn't seem to be working in our room and he said he could move us to a different room but we would then only complain again about something else. Blimey! I said that sounded a bit rude and not great customer care but he just shrugged. I then asked if we could have a spare duvet to put under the sheet to lie on as the bed was really hard and he said he would arrange it (which he didn't until I asked again about 5 hours later at bedtime). There were no mattress toppers/protectors on the beds (so the sheet is directly on top of the mattress - not super hygienic) and we were advised later that this is because they were single beds and they can't get toppers for these!! On our last morning we had a 12 noon check out but were woken at 7.10 am with the loudest noise - which sounded like a helicopter in the bedroom and lasted over 10 minutes. It was as loud in the corridor and I rang reception who could hear it too. We were later advised that this is a monthly test in the apartment block in the same building and should not be done until after 9 am. We asked to speak with the manager as we were leaving and explained what had happened. He promised to check out our issues and refunded approximately 10% of our stay. He advised that he had heard my comment upon arrival about the poor customer service and had asked the receptionist what the issue was after we had gone but been told it had been sorted out. I think that a manager hearing a customer saying that the customer service is not very good, should intervene immediately to try to remedy the situation. He also advised that the beds had not been replaced for 5 years but had not received any complaints which he had been surprised about as he would imagine that beds needed replacing every 3 years. But why wait until guests complain before replacing them? The report of the air con not working had never been noted by the receptionist and therefore no maintenance was requested.

We thought it would be uncomfortable, but they joined them, had a cover on top, a duck down layer on top of that, and then the sheets etc. The bed was surprisingly comfy for joined singles!! The doona was luxurious and soft! The smell on the other hand, we figured out it was spilt milk that hadnt been cleaned out of the carpet very well. We just left the window open most of the time so whenever we returned we didnt get hit with a wall of vomit smell. The bathroom was failry small, but definitely big enough for 2 nights. However it was not very well cleaned. Lots of different colours/types/lengths of hair in the corners and over the floor. And there was shaving cream or similar on the inside of the shower curtain from the last guest. The shower curtain likes to join you in the shower, quite annoying but like any other shower curtain! I saw a couple of reviews complaining about the water temperature, but our room actually had a plaque on 'how to' use the shower so that you didnt burn and freeze, so that wasnt a problem. We had a 'Do not Disturb' sign on our door, as we didnt feel we needed our room serviced daily. When we returned from our day out, there was a plastic bag at our door with fresh towels and bath mats in it. The rooftop leisure area was quite nice. Not much around the pool but the sun room type level was great. And let you look out over the whole city. It's a shame you couldnt see the harbour bridge or Opera house though, but was still quite nice, and fresh.

On arrival, the reception looks fine if a little tiny. Two busy, presentable and polite receptionists. The problem is what lies behind the reception: narrow corridors leading to small, noisy, depressing rooms with tired decor and spartan furnishings; overall the impression is that the place is grubby and nothing like the published pictures - I really should have taken some pictures to back this up. The first room we were given was small and noisy - the windows faced onto hyde park and the busy main roads that border it; the windows were dirty and one window didn't close properly - which added to the noise - it wouldn't have been a quiet room even with the window closed. We took the matter up with reception - after a considerable wait, having had to rejoin the check-in queue, another room was found for us after some persistence. Though quieter than the first room and slightly larger, it only had a small high slit window and so lacked much natural light - same depressing tired decor as the first room. The bathroom consisted of a cramped toilet and shower. It does not have any of the facilities that one has come to expect in this price range - bar, restaurant, etc. note that many favourable reviews emphasise its proximity to such amenities - to be honest, I have no idea why others give this place such high ratings - but that's their prerogative. We found it to be so bare, cramped, grubby and depressing that we checked out having paid for one night and found accomodation nearby at the Menzies hotel - suffice to say that this is a large, spacious hotel in an excellent, central location with bars, restaurants, a large indoor swimming pool, gymnasium etc. etc; the room was huge, well furnished and clean - and \u00c2\u00a320 per night cheaper than the Park Regis. I note that comments similar to my own go way back over some time yet the responses from the management of this establishment to such criticisms are nothing more than a formulaic whitewash presumably aimed at reassuring prospective customers. This is undoubtably the most negative review I have ever written; as such, I should point out that I have absolutely no connection with the Park Regis (or the Menzies for that matter); I'm simply reporting my experience of the Park Regis, its Premier room and how it compares with other establishments near by.", "Date": "January 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bath", "Title": "\u201cPark Regis City Centre is not a Hotel nor a Motel\u201d", "Author": "scott_p14", "ReviewID": "UR93980185", "Content": "The Park Regis City Centre is not a Hotel nor is it a Motel or Travelodge. there are no facilities e.g. Bar , Breakfast room or Restaurant .

NOISE: Others have commented on noise being an issue, particularly at night. While we did hear some noise, it was not excessive, and we were able to sleep without any problems. Found it best to have the window completely closed, as made a huge difference. FACILITIES: We booked a \"family room\", which was one room with a King bed and Single bed. While not a lot of space in the room, it was still comfortable, and we survived the 5 days without getting on each others nerves. Our bathroom was small, but not too cramped. Each room seemed to have a different bathroom configuration, so I guess it depended on which room you were allocated. Room had all necessary facilities - iron, board, hairdryer, tv, mini fridge, kettle etc. Roof top deck offered fantastic views, and a great place to relax. Pool good, although water was quite cold due to it being quite windy up on the 45th floor. VALUE: We stayed in the Park Regis in the days leading up to and including New Years Eve, so did pay more than the usual rates, however when compared to other hotel rates for the same period, Park Regis was still good value.

The check out time is unexpectedly early (10:00a.m.) as most of the hotels I stayed before, the check out time should be at least 11:00a.m. and the most ridiculous thing is that if you would like to request for a late check out, you need to pay extra $30-40 (I forgot the exact amount as I do not expect to pay for this) and I think that the hotel needs their staff the clean up the room but didn't employ enough staff to do so, so kick the guest out earlier and give them more time to clean up!!!!

Not much lighting must say, although there are 2 lamps in the bedroom and a light at the desk there isn't an actual light within the bedroom so felt kind of dark even during the day.

No romantic or other special treat - it was just for weekend accommodation whilst attending a conference, so there were no great expectations. We liked the location as it was pretty close to everything we needed: The conference venue, an easy walk to Chinatown for dining, the Galeries Victoria monorail station nearby for transport to and from some sightseeing and with the close proximity of Town Hall railway station a block or so away, rail transport from the airport was a breeze. The tariff, considering this is the middle of Sydney, was attractive also. Those travellers who really do need room to swing a cat could possibly consider the room a little small but we're in central Sydney; space is at a premium. I believe this establishment has been has been around for about forty years and is starting to show it's age. For example, because of water pressure issues, some technique is needed if one is to enjoy a shower that is at an ambient temperature (No bathtub, so don't look forward to stretching out in a relaxing sea of warm water.). The other age (The building, not me!) related issue is the air conditioning. The advertising says \"air conditioning\" and whilst there is apparently an ancient evaporative plant somewhere in the building, it is turned off for the winter months and warm air is pumped to the rooms. There is no individual temperature control other than to have it either off or on. We found those two conditions made the room either hot or hotter. The solution was to open the window, put up with the noise of the traffic and risk the rain coming in. If the marketing says \"air conditioned\" then one's expectation is that it's functioning. Apart from the air-con gripe, Park Regis served our purpose. Clean secure efficiently maintained ensuite accommodation in central Sydney at a reasonable tariff and with courteous and helpful staff.

It's right in the centre of the city, right near shopping, restaurants and Elix'r gym. That's about the best part of it though. Although the hotel does not bill itself to be five star, it certainly wasn't up to the standard I was expecting.

Although I accept that there was a shortage of accommodation, the hotel was not fully booked and for the price paid, I would have expected better. I've stayed in many hotels, apartments and youth hostels in Sydney and for the price paid, the Park Regis was certainly the worst value. The room fittings were old and to say the room was cosy is being generous. I have no issue with no frills establishments and if the price was under $150, I would not have been as annoyed. But for the price paid, I would have had better facilities at Sydney Central YHA (and had a private with ensuite for considerably less). The staff were friendly and as previously mentioned, the location is perfect, but these were the only positives.

Having worked as a waitress for three years communication and keeping guests happy is the way to be. Unfortunately not once was I greeted good morning or how may I help you while entering and exiting the hotel (and mind you they weren't doing anything just talking amongst each other). I have to make a special mention to the name Louis- who treated my boyfriend and I with such disrespect that if it werent for the great location of the hotel, we probably would have left. He not once greet us BUT he had time to acknowledge some French tourists who were leaving the hotel a \"bonjour\" and even had time to converse. Another incident with Louis was when my boyfriend didn't have a key since they only gave us one and I had the key since I was upstairs doing laundry. My boyfriend asked if there was a way that they can have him go up to our room. Louis replied that he can take the stairs but that would be 45 floors (since that's where the laundry room was) in a sarcastic and serious manner. There was another girl (Caucasian lady dark brown-red haired) that was with him and she gave him an attitude as well. Ultimately my boyfriend gave them an attitude (at this point we had been staying at the hotel for a week and have been seeing these front desk attendants daily!) and they proceeded to let him up. Unfortunately I do not have the name of the other one two that I am complaining about ( think the other man was John). We wanted to book two tours from the same company for the Blue Mountains and the Wine Tasting tour and had previously asked another host to book it for us. John (whom I will call by this name, he worked the afternoon shift until I think 10 or 11pm) , when asked to book it for us, looked at me in a funny manner and stated with a look on his face that was surprised by my question and a look that said \"You're crazy if you think that\", answered to me \"We do not do that.\" I then noted that I was surprised hotel front desk doesn't do that as I would think it would be part of their job description or if not, they can perform such act as a sign of courtesy and I know that having worked in some form of customer satisfaction industry. He then asked if I worked in the industry with now a smile and actually trying to be nice. I replied that as guests of the hotel that it would be nice for them if they did and didn't answer his initial question. He then proceeded to call the company and booked for us the two tours. Ever since then he was nothing but nice to us when we approached him-though all of the front desk personnel never really greeted us. Overall the trip was good. hotel? Not so good. 2.5 star. Ultimately, I would recommend the location- it is very close to Darling Harbor and China town (10min walk) Circular Quays (if you ilke to walk is about 20 mins) and very near convenient stores. Woolworhs grocery store is only a block away. Across the street is a McDonalds that has free WI-FI so don't bother using the hotel one. Look at my review for what amenities the hotel has, which is very few. NO: restaurant, room service, good service at all, air conditioning when its hot during the afternoon so they open the windows to let cool air in.. how cheap.

Getting a good nights sleep is one of the main things you look for in a hotel. Some of us were staying 10 nights and some were sharing 3 to a room. The rooms are small but certainly okay for a couple. Definitely not okay for 3 sharing for 10 nights - easy answer - we upgraded to an executive suite. It was not much dearer and meant we had more room and a nice decor. Would definitely ask for an upgrade at this hotel on my next visit. Our friend who was sharing with us got bad news on our first day and had to get to Brisbane urgently. The staff organised everything for her, getting her flight information so she had a couple of times to choose from and then booking the flight. It was left open for her to come back to the hotel as and when she could. They could not have been more helpful. The location was perfect, everything we wanted to get to in less than 30 minutes (my slow walking speed) walk away - Paddy's Market, Darling Harbour, Opera House and botanical gardens, Kings Cross, monorail and train station. The reception was 24 hours and the taxi stand opposite the same. Lots of eateries all around including McDonalds and Hungry Jack across the road, clubs like the Catholic Club wich serve good meals for a reasonable price, the pub next door which serves big meals with lots of chips, again for a good price, the coffee bar downstairs a good breakfast and great coffee, Gloria Jeans opposite on one corner and Starbuck opposite in the other direction. Being on a main street did mean there was noise throughout the night. Upgrading gave us double glazing in our bedroom but the lounge, where our friend slept, and which faced out on to the main street, did not have double glazing and she slept with the window partly open and did not find it difficult to sleep.

Everything worked and the bed was comfy. The shower was a bit tempremental when it came to giving us hot water but turning it off and on again seemed to sort that out. The bathroom was tiny but it was clean so it didnt really matter. The one thing that lets this hotel down the most is the fact that it is situated on a really busy road. This didnt keep us awake or prevent us from sleeping on week nights (but i would imagine that if you are a light sleeper you would suffer) but on Saturday night it would appear that Sydneyers don't sleep and the noise levels from the street are much worse. I would advise taking ear plugs with you if you are staying there over a friday or saturday night or you're a light sleeper in general. The reception has internet access and has plenty of tourist brochures. Pitt Street is just round the corner for shopping, and Woolies and Coles are down the road for your bits and bobs like water etc. The nearest train station is Town Hall (the airport link train stops here) and its approx 5mins if that walk from hotel. Darling Harbour and Circular Quay have plenty of places to eat and are worth visiting a night to see them lit up.

If your visiting the east coast of Australia click on my profile to see other hotels we visited. The Park Regis is in a fantastic location for being central to most of the tourist attractions, However it can suffer from the fact that there is no double glazing and at weekends the noise from the people coming out of the bars is clearly audiable, I read the previous reviews mentioning this and thought probably the same as what you are thinking now while reading this, \"no surely you cant here people talking in the street when your in your bedroom on the 11th floor with all the windows closed and air conditioning turned on\" Trust me you certainly can here them, the police sirens ambulances etc as well seem to go on until 3am. Having said that the I had some ear plugs which cut out the noise and also if you have a good drink you wont here it or if your a heavy sleeper. We did notice that it was only fri and sat nites mind you, and if it had being really really bad I would of moved us to another hotel, but it all depends on how easy you can get to sleep I guess as we are all differant. In terms of the room, we have 2 children aged 9 and 13 and we had a 1 bed room room with fold out bed in the lounge. No problems at all with the cleanliness of the room or hotel what so ever. I noticed others on trip advisor complain about the size of the bathroom, well I dont know how much room you need to shower or sit on the toilet but as far as we were concerned yet again no problems what so ever. The rooms had every thing we needed there was plenty of room it was clean modern apart from no double glazing it could'nt be faulted, depends on whether you want to trade off the fri-sat noise for the fantastic location. There is a swimming pool on the roof, floor 45, and I think its from floor 15 up over that its owned by local residents in induvidual apartments ie locals living in sydney, the hotel only owns from 14 downover. And you can most definately use the pool with the locals up on the top floor, cant comment on that as we were too busy to use the pool. The hotel staff were very friendly and helpful. For local directions etc Turn left out of the hotel and walk straight down Park st for approx 10 mins or so past the monorail and you will come to darling harbour, or simply grab the monorail which you can jump on and off all day long once you pay. For the Harbour Bridge and Opera house, Turn left out of the hotel, take the 1st right onto Pitt St and keep walking straight down approx 10 mins or so and you will come to Circular Quay and the Bridge area where all the ferries are and the Opera House, Check out the Manly ferry and Manly beach its better than Bondi beach after getting off the manly ferry just walk straight across the road down the pedestrianized zone and you will come to the actual beach, most people think the beach either side of the ferry at manly is the correct manly beach its not, walk through the shopping area opposite the ferry terminal. For that Spectacular Family Photo with the Opera House behind you and the Sydney Harbour Bridge behind the Opera house all in the same shot, you need to go to Mrs Macquaries Chair, as you look at the opera house in front of you its the green park over to your right and you can easily walk round to it, There are professional photographers there up the top section who for $10AUD will print you out a professional photo taken by them so you know you are getting that once in a lifetime moment captured professionally, get them to copy it to CD or onto your own cameras memory card so you can print it yourself and email it later I asked them and they gladly put my cameras memory card into there laptop and copied the photo they had just taken of us to my cameras memory card which was great as I can now get it printed out at differant sizes etc and framed. Families We found families are catered for well in sydney with regard to eating and drinking, however on the night time unless you are having a meal its pretty hard to simply walk in with the kids for a drink so simply walk in and ask for chips or something small and grab yourself a drink, APART FROM the Darling Harbour area where there was no problem, they have differant rules in darling harbour for kids as its the main tourist area but you still had to be out by 10pm at the latest with Kids, APART FROM the Pyrmont Bridge Hotel, pyrmontbridgehotel.com which we found to be the closest to an english pub in the central CBD area.

If outside noise is not an issue (and it is not that bad as suggested), this is a very modern, cheap and central hotel in Sydney and I would most definitely stay there again.", "Date": "November 20, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "VIC", "Title": "\u201cStaff are rude!\u201d", "Author": "hez7", "ReviewID": "UR10910510", "Content": "The location is good - but a few of the staff were rude, one of the guys said he didnt like us.

We booked their \"Spring Fever\" special that gave us a King size bed and free \"breakfast\" and a noon check out time. When we checked in, we noticed that the 2 breakfast packs were on the dresser. They each consisted of a small box of cereal, a small carton of milk, a cereal bar, bowl, spoon, sugar and a small carton of orange juice. The hotel sells these for A$7.95 each - glad we were getting them no charge. The next day when we returned to the hotel, there was only one pack on the dresser, and I had to let the people know that we needed a total of two. The staff, although trying to be helpful, did not have a great command of the English language. I finally got across to them that there should be two breakfast packs each day. They still never got it right until our last day. Be wary of their internet description. It says there are free daily newspapers at the front desk, but when I tried to take a paper, the staff person told me I had to pay for it, and the only free paper was the weekly one. I told him what it said on the internet and he rudely pointed out to me that he had been there 6 years and the papers were never free. Their hotel booklet states that there is a discount for guests that eat in the cafe next door. When we went there for dinner and showed the waiter our hotel key, he said the discount is for breakfast only! The bathroom is VERY VERY small. The hot water comes from an under-sink canister that can only provide a small amount of hot water at a time, so it is very hard to have a shower, without almost scalding yourself and then freezing. VERY dangerous! There was only one night table and one table lamp, but the room itself certainly had room for another night table. The closet was a stand-alone unit and very very small. There were two dinette style chairs in the room, so it was very uncomfortable to sit in the room to watch tv. The ceiling light was very dim. There was a flourescent fixture over the bathroom sink but it had a sticker on it saying it was temporarily disconnected. When I asked the clerk about our check out time she said 10 a.m. I suggested that she look up our reservation and when she did, she said it was 12 noon! I would not stay here again.

We booked a standard Studio for AU$129. The reception staff were super friendly. We were allowed to check-in at 9am instead of 2pm. I jokingly asked for a free upgrade, since it was my birthday the next day, and suprisingly the young reception guy did not hesitate at all! He gave us a \"slightly larger\" room worth AU$179. *THANKS MATE!* Although big enough for 2 people, the room wasn't that big, so it makes me wonder how small the original room would've been. We were on 7th floor with a view of Park St, which wasn't that great since we weren't very high up... However it was very nicely furnished, with a small widescreen TV in front of the bed. As for the bathroom, it was PUNY. The toilet was only a feet away from the shower CURTAINS. Showering was ok but very squashy, and water leaked onto the whole bathroom floor. Sleeping was a nightmare - probably coz we were on the 7th floor facing the street, and it was a Saturday night. But I did an allnighter the night before! And the bed was comfy! So I thought I would be easily knocked out from 36hrs without sleep!!! >=( .. I woke up so many times during the night, but then at 5am I turned on the radio and managed to sleep til 9am without hassle. Oh, and it costs $20 for every hour after check-out so beware. For some reason the clock in the hotel room was half an hour fast, which we didn't realise til we went to stay at another hotel hehe All in all, I would stay at this hotel again, for its location and price.

After flying for 10 hours to get to Sydney with my partner, this was not appreciated! Finally, after much discussion, a Premier King room became available. The room itself is quite nicely finished for a 3 star property - modern and fresh. The biggest problem is the noise from outside. Single glazed windows means that even on the 10th floor, you are awaken multiple times throughout the night by street noise - people, vehicles, sirens, and the rest. The other problem we had is that on the 3rd night, we left the room at 1pm. Apparently housekeeping had finished for the day, so they left fresh towels outside the room in a plastic bag for us! Not very professional at all. The staff at the hotel are a bit of a mixed bag. Biggest complaint I have is that the staff should remember they are working at a 3 star hotel, hot a 5 star one! Attitudes are sometimes not very friendly, and on check-out, we had to pay $2 to store each bag for a few hours. I have never had to pay to store my bag at any other hotel and after spending $700 at the hotel, I was fairly unhappy having to pay $4 to keep two bags there for a few hours!
