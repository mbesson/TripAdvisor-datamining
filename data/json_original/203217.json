Claudio at Hotel Tirreno answered my emails promptly and was very accommodating. The best thing about this Hotel is the location--walking distance from Termini but on a quiet street away from the Termini hotel frenzy. Very easy to walk to all the major sites in Rome. However, the room was dark and gloomy. The only window was around the side of the bathroom and did not let any light into the room. The bathroom was nicely tiled and fitted with toilet, bidet and standing shower. We had 2 twin beds that were OK and one extra bed that was just a step above a camp cot. But sleep comes easily when you've been out touring wherever you lay your head. Breakfast was good coffee and tea plus juice, corn flakes, pastries and a basket of packaged goods like biscuits and cookies. Nutella, butter, jams were provided to go with your croissants. Claudio was very nice and helpful as were the ladies who served breakfast. The other clerks were distracted and not very interested in being helpful. One night as my girlfriend and I were up late talking in the sitting room of the hotel (so as not to disturb my mother who was sleeping in the room) the Hotel Clerk asked us to leave so that he could close up. So it seems that the sitting room is only available for guest use during certain hours. Overall, this is an average hotel in a great location. Since I was not planning on being in the room other than to sleep it was fine for what I needed.", "Date": "December 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Greece", "Title": "\u201cDisappointing\u201d", "Author": "ToTravel_10", "ReviewID": "UR120537105", "Content": "This is my 3rd review for a hotel in Rome. I would have liked to go again at Imperial Suite but the travel agency solved my accommodation so it was a surprise at what hotel I will land. I must admit that I am a little impressed with all the comments from tripadvisor. It is true that it is clean but it should be refurbished or redecorated and maybe renovated. It has an old flavor. It is not a new hotel or with new furniture. If you book at this hotel take care in what room you will stay. My room was an incredibly small one and when I asked for a bigger one they said that I should pay an extra amount. The bathroom was very very small and the doors from the shower were with stains of water. On the TV there were only Italian channels. The blanket that was on the bed it had to be washed. The breakfast consisted of coffee/tea, orange juice, butter/marmalade, 1 croissant & 1 small piece of bread and a basket with bought things (corn flakes,pies,biscuits). The breakfast didn't surprised me so much because this is the Italian breakfast as far as I know. Another problem was with the internet. Only till 23:00 o'clock you could have internet and only in the lobby. On short I am not sure if I would go back to this hotel.

You can get cheese and butter but you have to ask for it. Major drawback is staff does not allow discount for returning customers. They also lack any information on renting scooters/cars. I think they have airport transport, but generally they are at a pretty good location. Was good they kept our bags before we checked in. Prices vary very much depending on the days of stay coinciding with Vatican's Christian Holidays.

We stayed 6 nights in room 201 which is a triple room on the back corner of the building with windows on two sides providing great ventilation, and an a/c unit which we did not use. The room was not overly large, but equal in size to all other triple hotel rooms we stayed in during our travels. The bathroom was spacious and good with windows on two sides, and there was sufficient cupboard space to empty two of our 3 carry-on sized suitcases. The third suitcase was conveniently slipped under the bed for storage during the 23.9 hours a day it was not being used. The little bar fridge was adequate to store our survival kit of chocolates and beer, and we found BBC World News to watch on the TV. We never heard any other guests whilst in our room, with the exception of one couple chatting whilst getting out of the lift one night. The staff at the front desk were always friendly and helpful and willing to speak english with us. When emailed direct, the reservations manager was quite happy to give me another nights accomodation after I had made a mistake in my booking.com booking and it was showing no availabilty for my extra day. Breakfast was a Continental breakfast. It filled us all up for our exciting day ahead, and was served by the lovely ladies in the dining room (Italian speaking) - cappuchino included. My 9yo son was also very chuffed to have hot chocolate every morning and over the moon when he found the individual serves of Nutella in our breakfast basket - I had never seen a croissant with nutella spread all over the outside of it until then. There are some restaurants in the same street - less than 50m away , which we dined at for most nights - special mention to the restaurant \"Il Nizza\" (I think thats its name) which provided good , honest food at reasonable prices (menu Touristico was 10 euro) and run by a young couple who were nice,genuine honest people. The location was excellent , only 10 minutes walk from Termini station, and like some people we had difficulty finding it the first time - I put it down to my Southern Hemisphere navigational skills (which sometimes dont work too well in N.Hemisphere) as the street was on my map.

The windows were near the top of the wall so we had to stand on a chair to open them. Then we had a view of the knees of people walking on the patio, and they had a clear view down into our room. So we ended up keeping the windows shut all the time. The air conditioner dripped water all night. We mentioned it to front desk but nothing was fixed so we laid towels underneath every night. The hotel overall is dull and dingy, the carpets were filthy. The street it is located on is narrow and home to a couple of tiny bars.

We were early so couldn't check in till after 2pm and when we returned to check in we found our room (on the 4th floor) to be completely smoky and the bathroom smelled as though somone had died in there then they used heavy duty cleaning solution to disinfect it! As we were so tired we thought we could air the room out by opening the balcony doors while we had a sleep for a couple of hours....no such luck. After just over two hours in the room we were both choked up from the smoke and cleaning products stench that we couldn't breathe even with the doors wide open. I'm asthmatic and didn't want to cause a fuss but there was no way I could stay in the room. We went down and told the front desk of our problem and were told 'everybody smokes' even though it was supposed to be a non smoking room, and 'what can we do?' i asked if we could change and we were given the key to another room (303) to see if it was acceptable...it stil smelled of smoke but not as bad as the other room and no chlorine stench either so we swapped rooms immediately. This room was about 1/2 the size of the previous one but for our lungs sake we didn't care. The breakfast at the hotel was pretty average...a couple of stale bread rolls and a crossiant and the usual mini toasts and crackers. Coffee that was like thick sludge. other partons were offered esspresso but we weren't. When we asked she said 'no espresso'...weird. We went out for breakfast every other morning. On a good note the little restaurant almost across the road I think it's called 'nipitino de solitarno' or something to that effect is fantastic! The pasta, bruschetta, pizza, wine and everything we ate there was fantastic and we never paid more than 30 euros for our dinner. On the whole the location was ok....the walk to the termini is easy but that area is a bit shady after dark.

We went to the hotel reservation service at the train station to find a hotel after a lousy experience with a hotel booked from the travel agent. They give us a very small room initially, but asked if we liked the room. We didn't but let it go. When we come back from dinner, Giorgio (what a sweetie) could tell that I really didn't like the room and offered the next day to switch us to a bigger room. We were stunned! Our previous experience was with a nasty hotel who didn't even offer to change anything after we complained. Plus the room had a tub, which I insisted on. Giorgio was so great he directed us to dinner, and told us to use his name for a discount! He gave us recommendations on how to get around and was all around fantastic. The neat thing about the hotel is you are in the middle of the two metro lines Cavour down the street and Victtorio Emmanuel up the street and around the corner. Giorgio also gave us the heads up on taxis--dont! they rip you off. The next day, we went sightseeing using the metro and our Rick Steves guide. Here's a tip--take the metro to Cavour and go to Colloseo (I think it is only one stop away), when you get out of the station look across the street and be blown away. We then returned to the room which they gave us three choices. We finally picked room 101 which is a big room with its own little patio and shade tree--a lovely spot for a glass of wine at the end of long day of walking. Fantastic!

We were delighted to find that our expectations were off the mark. Our room and bathroom was very clean and modern. The shower was just like at home with great water pressure. Although the rooms were small by American standards, the French doors leading to a large balcony made the bedroom seem larger. There was a table and chairs on the balcony and we sat out there with our friends evey afternoon and enjoyed the peacefulness. The hotel was very quiet and we slept with the French doors open each night. The hotel staff was very friendly and helpful. They always greeted you with a smile and provided guidance on what to do and directions. Breakfast was typical continental. Since this was our first trip to Rome, we reserved the hotel limo service for pickup at the airport. The driver was waiting for us with a sign with our name on it and he whisked us and our baggage right to the hotel. I would recommend you do this if you are unfamiliar with Rome or don't like having to wait in lines for a taxi. The ristorante and pizzaria just across the street from the hotel do have limited menus, but the food is great and you can't beat the prices. Best pizza ever. The hotel's location is great. On a side street away from the crowds but close enough to walk to public transportation or the sights.
