Now the cons- there are MANY. Rooms smell bad, have never been properly cleaned (check the air con vents - yuk), are extremely noisy and have things that don't work - ie. when a DVD plater breaks they don't replace it (neither room we tried had one). After our first noisy night I asked if we could be moved to a quieter room. They lamented that the standard rooms are all in the noisy corner positions but they did have one at the back but no windows or balcony. As sleeping was our priority that night and the room was much cleaner, we took it. After being in the room for a while, we noticed the air con was dripping quite heavily onto the bedside table. i pulled the bedside table forward and found water splashing onto a power point. We turned it off and told the staff on our way out who promised to look into it and swore they hadn't known (even though an unplugged lamp was nearby). When we returned we found that their way of dealing with it was to put a towel under it. Not having the air con on was too stuffy in a room with no windows but being electrocuted in the night would have been worse. This place needs to be closed down.", "Date": "April 8, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Central Coast", "Title": "\u201cA Pleasany Stay\u201d", "Author": "Gary H", "ReviewID": "UR126117606", "Content": "The Haven Inn is a medium sized, friendly, and convenient place to stay in Sydney.

Despite the photos showing a restaurant, there is in fact no restaurant at all - unless they're claiming the cafe across the road as their restaurant.There is no lift so if you're on a higher floor you need to climb the stairs. I travelled in a party of 5 and we had 2 different rooms. One room was at the front of the building and in the 15 years I've travelled around the world, I've never experienced so much noise! A bus goes past every 5 minutes and you could almost touch it out the window! The other room was at the back of the building so definitely quieter. When we opened the door to this room, it stank, it was dark and gloomy and despite knowing there were 3 guests staying, they only provided 2 towels. Both rooms were tired with badly worn decor and would barely pass the cleanliness test. The beds sank in the middle and you could feel the spring in your back and the pillows were terrible. 2 of the 5 pillows I looked at were actually broken inside the cover so it was like sleeping on 2 lumps which were paper thin! It looks like they've recently painted the bathroom doors but they've only had one coat and you can see the roll marks and in many places where the paint has accidently ended up on the ceiling. We paid about $110 per night for each room and stayed for 2 nights. I think that they should be charging backpacker prices of no more than $50 - $60 per room per night - and even then, it needs a good clean. The only thing the place has going for it is it's location. It's on the bus route and only about 5 minutes by bus to the CBD. It also has nice restaurants and cafes nearby.

I was happy at the time of booking because the motel looked beautiful on the website. What a difference it is in person. We arrived to no underground parking, when we inquired, the \"receptionist\" came out and grudgingly moved his own motorbike, and then we had to get him to park our car as the parking spaces were so small. When we were told we were on the third floor we took the steps with trepidation due to our first impressions. When we got into the room it was like an oven and smelled. There were tiles missing off the bathroom floor, the smoke alarm was hanging from the roof, the \"balcony view\" was over a back lane and into a rundown house next doors yard. The stairs down to the pool were filthy with half the roof missing in the stairwell. The cleaners cart was just left at the end of the corridor under the missing roof, god knows what bugs extra would have gotten into it. The pool had tiles missing from around the edge and was fithly and rusted on the sides. The steps and hand rails into the pool were very loose and unstable. There was no restaurant as the website predicted, you were directed over to a cafe across the road where we found out that the owner of the cafe was the owner of the motel. On our second day the air con broke and when we asked about it the reception said there was nothing he could do. We demanded to be moved and was eventually moved into a room smaller (if possible) than the first, thank god it was only for one night. They also claim on their website that movies are free, however they aren't. The whole motel is a disgrace and should be shut down for being filthy, not meeting aus safety standards and unsafe.

Had read some very positive reviews and also some very negative ones so went with an open mind and as it was only for one night I wasn't too perturbed about the negative ones. The young guy on reception when we arrived was very pleasant and helpful. Yes, the photos on the website do make it look a bit nicer that what it is, but the location makes up for it as it is an easy walk to a variety of cafes and restaurants. It was an extra $15 to park the car and the car park is very small and is hard to maneouvre in and out of a car space, took a small car so wasn't too bad but a larger vehicle may have some difficulty. I was able to leave the car parked there after we checked out which was much appreciated and also great value as car park costs in and around the city are very expensive. Noise is a problem as it is right on the road with buses going past during the night, council trucks in the early hours of the morning and a few arguments out on the street from people walking past didn't do much to help get a good night's sleep. Our room was also near the pool and so we had a lot of noise from that but I don't really mind the sound of kids having a bit of fun. The pool closed at 9pm and the noise from the pool stopped straight after that. We had a balcony but it is very small and really only good to stand on to get a bit of fresh air. The television had very poor reception so gave up trying to watch anything and went for a walk instead. Stairs may cause a problem for those needing to carry a bit of luggage and perhaps prams etc. All in all, not a bad place for a night's stay but I wouldn't want to base myself there much longer than that. The room was clean as was the bedding and towels and if you're looking for something at the lower end of the price range close to the city and you don't want to spend a lot of money or a lot of time in the hotel itself, then I think it's ideal.

So we went along and stayed anyway, we weren't quite sure what to expect. What we did get was a comfortable room that was value for money in a great location with friendly staff. The Hotel & Room: The photos ARE of the hotel, but obviously they are staged and glamourized - most hotels do that, so not sure what the fuss is all about. The pool was heated and ready to go but we weren't too keen on swimming in the colder weather. We had an average looking room obviously refurbished and had no issues with any of the amenities (except the pillows, you definately want to bring your own). Didn't see any cockroaches.... Overall, the place ain't nothing special but it does the job. If you want something fantastic then spend your fantastic money and stop complaining. Location: You just can't top it. Several kms from the city we had the \"bridge views\" so they are not fantasy! I'm amazed at all the people whinging about it being noisy - it's in GLEBE people, learn to use google maps. This AINT out in the suburbs somewhere, you're talking a busy inner-city area... what do you expect? If you are sensitive to early morning traffic this isn't the place to go, but if you want to stay in a great area close to the city then this definately is worth a look. Parking: Limited spots so get in early or make other arrangements. Only a short walk from the train station though. Wasn't very happy to pay $15 extra for parking - thought that was a rip, so rethink this one if you can. End of the day, for what I paid, the room was not too bad. We got a good sleep, had good amenities at our disposal and the location was great. You can always find things to whinge about nomatter what hotel/motel but we generally enjoyed our stay.

There are times in your life where you need a budget motel and this serves that need. But I warn anyone who books to ask for a first floor room as lugging a suitcase up three flights of stairs ,is a tedious exercise and also, when something goes wrong ,as did my credit card type key ,which did not work twice, my fault as I put it near my mobile phone apparently, I had to go down to the desk and then up again once it was re keyed. and then go back down again,good exercise I suppose. I am 52 so anyone contemplating staying there or anyone who is eldrly should reconsider staying here, because anything that involved an emergency would make it very difficult to get out in a rush, without an elevator. There is assistance to help with luggage, and I could definately have asked for that and should have done this..Balcony ,no room to swing a cat or sit on dirty chair, and little view of anything. Video would not work for my free DVD and as I rang the guy at the desk telling him about the problem, he came up immediatley and showed me how to get it working, and this impressed me. There are times in your life where you want a budget motel and this served my needs and the cost was very reasonable, considering many of the other hotels were either too expensive or booked out. If I was young and energetic I would stay there again.Staff did not say much or greet you each morning but it was only a relative type stay , so iIwasnot sightseeing and it served my needs.

The hotel is well-placed for public transport - the buses feel like they're right in your room. Glebe is not a bad area, but this hotel has little to recommend it. The hotel website seems to have taken creative photography to new heights, as our 'superior' balcony room looked nothing like the pictures - the couch was falling apart, the furniture was basic and worn, and there were bare wires hanging down above the shower head, where the bathroom renovations hadn't been finished. We asked for a different room, but none was available, we asked for a replacement DVD player because the one in the room was broken, but got a 'there's nothing I can do' response from reception - this seems to be their standard response as we also heard it when asking them to book an airport bus for us after 9pm.

The outside of the hotel is ghastly. Even in the 1970s, this would've looked out of date. You then get to reception, and one whole wall has been replaced with clear glass showing, errr, a car park.

A large bed, a single bed next to it, TV & DVD player, good air-con, fridge, iron, large bathroom (walk-in shower). The reception has a large selection of DVDs for you to borrow (no charge). And yes, there is quite a small but nice outdoor pool. And the reception staff are really friendly. Full marks there. All in all, it's not a bad hotel, as long as you close your eyes as you walk in.. but the location is truly terrible. You're 30 minutes (2 miles) walk from Central Station, 2 miles walk from Darling Harbour. There ARE bars and shops near the hotel, but very little else. Personally, I would opt for a hotel in a better location - there are plenty of quiet, similarly-priced hotels closer to Central Station, and all will then allow you to walk to Darling Harbour, the shopping precincts, and so on.

Mid - March 2006. Superior spa room. Cost on wotif - $140/nite. When the Legion cab bearing yours truly pulled up at the Haven, I frankly didn't know what to expect. The reviews I'd read of the place conflicted wildly and I hadn't set foot in trendy Glebe since Star Wars was on at the Valhalla. So I'd come prepared for anything. OK. First impressions. The Haven isn't going to win any prizes for architecture. I'm tipping that the rash of heritage orders in this area didn't get going til well after the Haven was already up. With its off-white brick exterior and early 70's decor, it's not a particularly attractive building from the outside. If you're looking to take in the Victorian ambience of Glebe's streetscapes, I suggest you take a walk down Glebe Point Rd with the Haven behind you at all times. 1/5 for external appearance. Once inside though, the place doesn't seem too bad. The girl on reception's friendly, efficient and helpful. There's no waiting to be checked in and no leave-a-credit-card-or-$100-cash-to-cover-your-mini-bar-rorting formalities either. Guess that's cause there's no mini-bar. There's no lift either and I'm on the top floor, but the offers of assistance with the bags are coming thick and fast. On top of all that, I can get free DVD for the night, so happy days. 5/5 for check in. Up the stairs and into my room and it's cold (YES!!!) there's air conditioning and it works a treat. Despite the sub-tropical Sydney funk of the day outside, I have to turn it down in the end because it's just too efficient. 5/5 for air conditioning. The room's reasonably sized and clean enough, but the balcony is quite small and spartan and at no time during my stay do I get motivated to venture out there. The room decor's like you used to see in country motels - in fact the whole place reminds me of the Flag Inn at Holbrook circa 1988. It's clean and it's comfortable. It's not 5 star. There's a small fridge with tea and coffee making facilities and an iron and board as well. 3/5 for the room. The bathroom is OK, but quite overwhelmed by the spa with shower over. The sink is also pretty small and awkwardly located under a shelf, causing me to headbutt the shelf when I was brushing my teeth. 3/5 for the bathroom. Across the road is the Toxteth Hotel - a fine drinking establishment even if the punters DON'T like my jukebox selections. What's wrong with some people anyway? The Ramones are SEMINAL, man. Glebe Point Rd is littered with eating establishments so you won't go hungry, ever. It also boasts the highest proportion of Tarot reading places per square mile in the southern hemishere. 5/5 for local activity. Night time. Noise. Oh deary me. How's the serenity? Well there isn't any. Glebe Point Rd has a surprisingly high volume of traffic late at night. The double-glazing mentioned in an earlier review was not in evidence and this is no place for the light sleeper. 0/5 for serenity. Brekky. The price is right at $5, but don't expect a wide selection. A bit of fruit to go with the cereal would've been appreciated. 2/5 for breakfast. Overall I'd recommend the Haven for budget travellers and those with powerful sleeping drugs or narcolepsy. For $140/nite, I've found better places in the city on wotif in the past. The Haven staff are quite good but the building is a bit dated and could use some maintenance.
