I had my two teenage sons with me, so they were ok with it, but they were not really all that excited for the place. Not much for them to do. The location was ideal. You walk out the door and see all the stars in the sidewalk. The staff was exceptional and treated everyone with equal respect. Even the valet parkers had class. They worked hard - running to get people their cars in a timely manner. I asked for help several times and the staff were always courteous and helpful. The rooms were on the smaller side, but it was nicely decorated in a contemporary theme. Clean. The only thing I really didn't like was the pool. It was small with not many chairs around it. There were cabanas, but they're pricey to rent. Starting at something like $200 and up to in the $1000s. Definitely not kid friendly. Keep in mind in the summer months, the weekends are reserved for adult only parties at the pool, so the kids are definitely not allowed in then. The restaurant attached to the pool was very cool looking and trendy, but again, after a certain time, there is a hefty cover charge and the kids are not allowed in. If I stayed there again, I would either go only with my husband or go with friends.

Super comfy beds, really friendly staff etc. The downside to this hotel is that because the club is on the roof and the lounge is in the lobby and trickles outside to a bar that faces Hollywood Blvd, you're pretty much in for a night of limited sleep if you're on the club side of the hotel or facing Hollywood Blvd. Always try to ask for a room that faces Argyle or or is on the non-club side of the building. I've found that rooms you can't go wrong with tend to be between the 5th and the 9th floor on the even side of the building ending in 38 or 40. Other rooms to avoid are ones that are directly above the valet on the lower floors (think these end in like 20 or 22).

It may be worth US$89 on a good day. Maybe. W needs to understand that \"design-driven\", even if minimalist, is NOT an excuse to scam us on the cheap. Their usual cute trick is to \"renovate\" old Holiday Inns (or whatever) into \"luxury properties\" but after staying at 3 now, I am convinced this is a scam to go low budget on cost and try to use \"hipness\" to sell crappy hotel rooms at astronomical prices. So, shame on me for being fooled, I guess. Apart from location, this property is a disaster. The rooms are dark and poorly constructed. Everything is thin and low-end feeling. White painted MBF furniture abounds, covered in white vinyl. A lot of it is chipped or stained and showing wear. The bed has a soft mattress with a hole in it, like sleeping in a hammock. Car parking is US$45 per day (on top of the $350!). There is NO pool (OK, they have one, but they have sublet it to a nightclub contractor, and guests cannot use it). For the four days we were there, the front door itself was actually broken, with a cutesy sign on it that said, \"I have issues\", (go around). For four days, you cannot fix the front door of your hotel? Really? They are understaffed, and what staff they have really couldn't care about guests at all. You have to give anyone $5 to get them to do anything. Their annoying refrain \"Whatever, whenever\" comes across more like, \"Yeah, whatever\". In spite of this - perhaps Hollywood plastic types are tragically stupid as well as hip - the place is packed. In particular they always seem to have a big event going on, but guests are neither invited nor allowed. Problem is that when you rent out your common areas to \"exclusive\" events, where do you ask your guests to go relax? Seems they haven't thought that one through. The nightclub on the roof of the hotel isn't related to the hotel at all, they claim. You have no special privileges there (despite the $350 room charge). You have to actually physically leave the hotel front door and go outside around the block to line up at a side entrance of the hotel building if you want to go up. At 11 pm, in this neighborhood, that means past 2 hookers, 6 homeless people begging, and a guy selling K (actual list from our experience). The place was empty after all that. Didn't stop all the staff form being arrogant, though. The only positive to this experience is that at checkout - I am guessing due to incompetence - they simply omitted to charge us over US$170 in various things like parking, drinks, a meal, etc. Hotel fun fact: All-nude stripper place across the street.", "Date": "March 15, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Stavanger, Norway", "Title": "\u201cHollwood without the W.\u201d", "Author": "VikingsEnjoyingLife", "ReviewID": "UR126070608", "Content": "Stayed here quite a few time.

The clientele included those with fancy sports cars, watches and arm candy, of both genders. However, if you want to get some sleep then this might not be the place for you.

The key thing that I always worry about when staying at a W is if the room is functional. Surprisingly there was an ample amount of desk space to actually get work done. Food: There are several dining options around the property as it is in the heart of Hollywood Boulevard. However, I decided to dine at the W\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Delphine, which was a solid selection, just right off the lobby.

I was a little concerns before arriving based on several very negative review on TripAdvisor. Well, either the hotel has made major changes or the reviews are just wrong. Yes, there are a few pointers that you have to be aware of, but overall, if you are wanting to stay in Hollywood, the W is a very good choice. Upon arrival, the valets and front desk staff were very friendly and welcoming. We were upgraded to a marvelous suite, which is a very nice room. The staff was sure to mention to us that the club on the rooftop (12th floor) and lobby can get very loud in the evening -- which to them is midnight to 3am. They suggested that we get a room on the middle floors to avoid and noise issues. We were on the 9th floor and it was just fine. Yes, you could hear a bit of the noise at night, but it was not bad enough to cause us any issue. (I was told, however, that rooms on the 11th floor -- right under the club -- felt a bit like you were sleeping on the dance floor.) Service was first class in every sense of the word. The bell staff was attentive and helpful, our car was always there and ready when we were heading out and everyone had a smile on their face. To be fair, the hotel is in a part of town that seems to be in early revival. The Pantages theater is right across the street and the hotel sit right above the metro station -- making it fairly convenient. The walk down to Hollywood and Highland Center (the home of the Kodak theater) is not bad, but there are a few seedy sections that you want through. And, the street vendors hawking tours of stars homes can be a bit annoying -- but also part of the charm. Overall, if you want to stay in Hollywood, the W is a current, hip and reasonable new choice. It's expensive, but not out of line with W hotels in general. (I am not sure that I get the $38.50 per night parking fee given the location -- there are large empty parking lots all around the hotel -- but assume that it is competitive locally.) I would return.

I have stayed in several W properties before: more established ones like San Diego, Seattle, and LA-Westwood and newer ones like Scottsdale, Hong Kong, and Taipei. The property itself is nice, however, the quality of service is really sub-par. My friend dropped my fiancee and I off at the front door, the bell man didn't even bother to open the door nor acknowledge our presence until I told him that we are checking in (maybe it's my friend's \"fault\" for driving a non-flashy, inexpensive car...) so I was immediately alarmed, I have always been greeted by enthusiastic W staffers wherever I have stayed. At check-in we were able to get a room and I failed to realize that the lady that helped us got the wrong reservation as I had paid more for my reservation, unknowingly, we went to the assigned room and were relaxing in bed until our door all of a sudden opened. There was a couple that had keys to our room! It was a shock for all of us! I don't even want to imagine how much worse it could have been? It was not until 20 minutes later I got a call from the Welcome Desk to apologize about the confusion! This kind of mistake should not even happen if I had handed the staff my drivers license and the credit card I I made the reservation with. The staff apologized and I let it go and let him know that it was ok. My fiancee and I went to the LA Opera with the car service arranged by the concierge who really was friendly and helpful so that was a plus. The next morning, I went downstairs and went outside trying to get some Starbucks and pastries for breakfast. I generally would greet and acknowledge people as I see them. Again, the bell men and valet were standing less than two feet from me and when I said \"Good morning, Gentlemen!\", they just stared and me and kept on talking to each other. WOW....... I thought in my head... this is really something else. What is wrong with these people these days? Is it because it's Hollywood? The property itself is not inexpensive and I am a world-traveler, these bell men and/or valet were the worst I have ever, EVER seen in a 4-star hotel. Hip and modern is W.

A comfortable bed, beautiful crisp decorations, and nice bathroom - along with great amenities. The location of the hotel is great for Graumans, the Hollywood Farmers Market, Katsuya, and other attractions on and around Hollywood Blvd. We were able to walk each morning, and even spotted a few celebraties near the hotel. For further distances (up to 5 miles) the Acura experience is certainly worth trying, and a great way to save a cab fare. As far as the nose compliant, we never had any trouble with it (though we are still in our 20s so we enjoy a good bar).

Each evening, this place becomes more like a giant nightclub that happens to have hotel rooms attached. The beautiful lobby becomes a pumping cocktail lounge, and there's the Drais nightclub for a clubbier atmosphere. The pool area is also a party venue, so there's plenty of choice without having to leave the hotel. Once the party kicks in, it can of course be quite noisy inside, so if you like your hotels to be serene and calming at the end of the day, this isn't the place for you. In the evenings the entrances are guarded by bouncers, and you'll have to push past the party-goers and show your room key to get inside. You'll do the same once inside to get to the elevators before finally getting to your room. Our room was spacious with a stylish fitout. Nice big bathroom, and plenty of room to unpack to move around in. Also very nice bathroom products from the spa downstairs. Note that there's no included tea or coffee making facilities in the room, but there is complimentary coffee in the lobby in the mornings. No tea though. Given that there are several nightspots within the same building, there is quite a lot of noise around the hotel, and the room was not well insulated against this. Music, shouting patrons and general crowd noise was clearly heard well into the night, only stopping at around 3am. Again, if you're here to party, and are a bit of a nightowl, this won't be a problem. The hotel's location on Hollywood Blvd also puts it in the middle of many popular nightspots, so there's plenty of party action going on just outside the door. The service was generally ok from the hotel staff. We only experienced a couple of strange situations - on checkin we were given a room with two beds, even though we'd booked one king bed. Rang down to reception and they said no other rooms were available. Then went down to ask in person, and was moved to a different room immediately. Also, soon after arriving I needed to organise a taxi to pick me up after dinner at a nearby restaurant. Since the party was in full swing in the lobby, and I wasn't sure where the concierge was, I asked at reception if they could book a taxi for me. \"No\" was the response. I was told that there was a taxi rank in the street not far away and that I should walk there and ask one of the drivers to pick me up. I don't think I've ever experienced a hotel refusing to organise a taxi, so I was very surprised that one of the W standard would do so.

The concierge service was below average for a W (we saw a guy, who did not pay much attention to us and a woman the next day who was more service-oriented). It still puzzles me why the W chain insists in ripping off guests with things like a $9 bottle of water in the room. If you stay at this chain and pay what they charge, you are already in a more select crowd, however, regardless of how much money you have, nobody enjoys the feeling of being taken advantage of. I think that either complimentary water or a $4 charge is more appropriate. Other than that, the pool is superb, great beds and lounge chairs to enjoy the pretty people...

I was a little aprehensive at first, not by the staff, they were lovely but by the items in the room that were for sale. I found it quite unnerving to be surrounded by items for sale in my room and had to be so careful not to open anything accidentally or it would be charged to my debit card and believe me, the prices were astronomical i.e. $9 for a bottle of water... WATER!!!! Not sure how closely Delphine is affiliated with the hotel itself but it seemed to be the same company... anyway, we had our first meal there and decided never to return. VERY expensive, food poor, service ok but not worth the prices. Our bill came to $110 and i didn't even have a starter and only one drink!!! My advice re eating? Drive to Mels Diner on Sunset, open 24/7 and the prices are amazing, food spot-on and service is the best. Anyway - hotel charge $5.95 for 15 minutes use of internet and $0.50 per printed black&white a4 sheet of paper... Disgusting!!!! So it cost me nearly $10 just to print our bording passes off to fly home. The room was nice, bathroom lovely and great shower but i found bed a bit hard. Apart from that though, room was great. Valet parking is $25 overnight with in/out which is pretty good but car park opposite charges $20 for 24 hours with in/out and is secure. There is a constant line of taxis that park alongside the car park at night so you can rest assured no damage will come to your car. Nice big TV in room with dvd player which was great. If you want to go to the pool on the roof, you can use it even though it is a different company to the hotel but beware, they will try to get you to buy food/drinks which are soooo expensive i.e. cocktails are $17 each, average bottle of spirit is around $500 EACH!!!! We sunbathed and used the pool for a couple of hours but felt uncomfortable not buying anything when we kept being asked. I think the hotel need to make it quite clear that the pool is nothing to do with them instead of using it as a huge selling point on website etc. Also the hotel seemed to be filled with people who have absolutely no consideration for other guests when returning to their rooms in the early hours of the morning because we were woken several times most nights!!!

It started even before we got to the hotel. I first contacted the hotel manager to request for some information since this was our first visit to L.A. In his absence, his wonderful assistant responsed quickly to my questions. Since I was travelling with my young family, she made sure that I was aware of what the hotel night life atmosphere would be like and even suggested that if I was not comfortable with that she would be more than happy to relocate us to another one of their other hotels . I was truely appreciative of that, but because we wanted to get the full Hollywood experience we were more than happy to stay there. At night it does get very busy with the nightlife crowd and security into the hotel is strict. But totally understandable, the hotel only wants to make sure that their guest are safe. As long as you show your room card to security they were more than happy to let you in. The only thing I was a bit disappointed in was that the internet in the room was an extra charge. The amount per day was not bad, but it was per unit, so if you had 2 laptops you would need to pay usage for each computer. Other than that, the W hotel was what we expected and more and we had a great view of Hollywood Blvd from our room. My youngest daughter especially enjoyed walking up and down the beautiful red carpeted staircase. The hotel staff was wonderful and was very accommodating.

I rang whatever whenever and the bed linen was taken care of straight the way. In the morning I asked to switch rooms to a higher floor with a better view and this was delivered without any hassle, we moved from the 2nd floor to the 11th floor.

We both liked the decor in the room it was very modern and much cleaner. As we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t rent a car during our stay we struggled to get around although we did use the local bus service. We were disappointed by the hotel surroundings, there were a lot of homeless men sleeping around near the hotel and we saw some unexpected events outside the hotel, such as police arrests and being approached by many of the homeless people, most of them are rude and asking for money. There are a few good restaurants in the area, Tender greens, Chipotle, kitchen 24 and Johhny Rockets (Kodak theatre).

We used the service once to take us to Beverly Hills, the service is only a drop off so we did have to find our own way back however this was no problem. We used the rooftop pool 3-4 times, My boyfriend & I decided to rent a day bed for the day which cost $150. I highly recommend doing this as you get treated like a celebrity! There are a few sun loungers around the pool, however these do get taken up very quickly. The drink & food at the pool are of a high quality and the view from the rooftop pool is also amazing!

Lets start with the upsides: It is a new and chic hotel in the center of Hollywood. Location is just perfect. Surrounded with many sightseeing points, nice bars and restaurants and many more. It is on the Hollywod boulevard, what else would you want?:) Fabulous king rooms are big enough for 2 people. Everything is brand new in the room, bed is super comfy, bathroom is equipped well with everything you need, electronic stuff is cool and fun. Downsides: Dont expect to see any nice, smiling or helpful staff. Every time you ask questions about anything they seem like you are bothering them or your question is too silly to ask. Especially reception staff! We stayed for 3 days and maybe we got the chance to see them all but they are all same. Shame for the name of W. There are 2 nightclubs in the hotel. One in the entrance area and one in the rooftop. These 2 clubs are always active and crowded in the evening and at night. Especially because of the one in the entrance area; reception, elevators, sitting area etc are always crowded. You see kids and adults (strange mix of people) wandering around with drinks in hand. Some of them drunk and speaking loudly or bothering you in the elevator while transfering to the roof bar from the down bar. Some of these party people are also staying at the hotel for a night and if they are staying next to your room, you are in trouble. There are no rules or regulations at the hotel to put all of these in order. Unfortunately it seemed to us that customers who come to nightclubs and spend a couple of hours in this hotel are more valuable than the customers who actually stay in this hotel and pay much more than the party animals. Dont even think about touching the drinking water in the room. It is 9 dollars. All extras are too expensive. Buy your own stuff from the supermarkets around and keep your money to yourself. Noise of the music from the clubs will always come to your room. Be prepared for that. If you are sensitive, you wont be able to sleep easily after a long day of discovering the city. I kept the most shocking thing to the end. When we entered the room, we found a post it on the LA guide book written by the previous guest saying: \"Dont let your 200 dollars to puff in the air!!\" How is that? :) If i go to LA again, i wont be staying in W for sure.

Our room was small and despite being on the 11th floor the view wasn't good, it overlooked a rooftop. For $300+ a night I guess I was expecting a little more from the room. It was very stark, cramped and typical (although the beds were wonderful). Anyways, after checking in we were excited to put on our suits and head up to the pool. But, then found out they were charging $20 per person cover charge to use the pool, yes, even for hotel guests. That's just crazy and had we known ahead of time we probably would have booked elsewhere. There was also no lounges available so our visions of lounging poolside, reading magazines and drinking girly cocktails were crushed and we just headed out to explore instead. Parking at the hotel is $35 (plus tax) and maybe that's the going rate for Hollywood but it seemed like the hotel was trying to nickel and dime every chance it got (even a charge for wi-fi). That night the lobby bar was going strong and had an amazing jazz group playing. They were cabaret style and super fun. We checked out the following morning and headed to the beach where we could actually catch some rays. So long story short, If you're ever in Hollywood on a Sunday night I highly recommend you head to the W for the jazz performance.

Saturday afternoon on the top floor with swimming pool is just a sort of MTV beach party with a DJ and girls dancing around. That is a real social experience of some American way of living I guess. Hotel is very noisy as you can imagine. Room service is just terrible : they just cannot get the right order. 3 times wrong out of 5 . Car valet ... Nice guys but amateurs. They need more than 15 minutes to bring one car. One advise, call from your room in advance ! You have to pay for wi-fi in your room. Water bottles are not complementary either.

We got a great deal on price, but having stayed in hotels of this (apparent) standard before, we had certain expectations. Many of these were not met, so here's a summary of them. Location: a hotel of this standard would be expected to be in a nice location. Don't be misled, the W is not in the cleaner, nicer West Hollywood area, but in the run down area of Hollywood Blvd, about a mile from the main Hollywood bustle. If you're into smoke shops, 'adult' shops and tattoo parlors, this is for you. If not, you may not (like us) enjoy the area so much. Surprising therefore that a 'designer' hotel would be located in this part of the city...in fact, we did not like the atmosphere outside of the hotel complex after dark. The hotel complex: nice restaurants and bar areas (if you're happy to pay $15 upwards for a drink) but full of wannabe types and those who reckon it looks good to be seen in this place. We were unimpressed by this. Compared to hotels such as the Gamercy Park in New York this one seemed to try too hard to be something it wasn't. Rooms: nice room, not massive, but had a nice look and feel, retro-futuristic design. We really liked the room. We had a courtyard view, which was nicer than the view onto a parking lot or the rather run down hollywood and vine area. Also this aspect meant it was quiet at night,so we got good sleep. Cleanliness: we couldn't honestly say whether our room was actually serviced or not. If it was, it was certainly a rushed job! Overall, nice rooms, wrong location, a hotel which attracts wanabe A-listers, but tries too hard to be something the location won't allow it to be. A good 3-star hotel at best, with some good price deals at the moment. Just don't expect the same feel as Sunset Blvd or West hollywood here!", "Date": "June 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, California", "Title": "\u201cStaycation Bliss\u201d", "Author": "kdem52", "ReviewID": "UR111825372", "Content": "Needed a break but couldn't get out of town.

To their credit, colleagues on 2 other floors had loud partiers in their hallways - and within a few minutes of calling the front desk to complain, those noise issues were corrected. The neighborhood definitely leaves something to be desired. It's pretty much a mix of stripper clothiers, tourist shops, tattoo parlors and a Trader Joes. The hotel itself is amazing, however. Morning and afternoons are lovely, quiet and mellow. In the evening it turns into a hot spot packed with hipsters looking to see and be seen. The Bliss Spa on the 4th floor is delightful. The restaurant on the roof has a great view, but beware the dresscode by the pool. This is definitely not a kid-friendly hotel, which was fine with us. Certainly not the place to bring the family if you're doing the California Disney circuit. Also, you will probably not feel comfortable schlepping around the W in shorts and a t-shirt.

It was just OK. The rooms are very very stark and minimalist. I absolutely love modern, minimalist design - but this hotel has done it very poorly. It feels cold and clinical - much like you are in an insane asylum! There is no artwork on the walls and very little color - it's all white basically. The bed in very low and there are a lot of fluorescent lighting (just to make it seem even colder). The shower had the worst pressure I've ever experienced - it was just better than a dribble! Was such a let down as the shower head looked so big and luxurious. The toilet blocked a few times and we had to call for maintenance to unclog it. The maintenance Service was prompt and followed by a courtesy call to see if everything was OK - a nice touch. The airconitioning was the loudest, most annoying system you'll ever hear - it stopped and started throughout the night with a big clunk and rattling sound like an old, noisy refrigerator. We ended up turning it off over night as it kept us awake! Whilst LA is very spread out, and its hard to find a good location for everything, the location of the hotel is terrible. It's sleazy and dirty. I felt a little unsafe at night. There's very little around in terms of shopping and eating - it is however, very conveniently located above Hollywood & Vine underground railway which you can take to Hollywood & Highland, for instance, where there is plenty more choice. The area looks to be improving though. I guess in 10 years it will be OK! For a good location - the Sofitel much better. I also didn't like that the pool was shared by Drais nightclub. Whilst a very funky looking area and a great night spot, it seemed like the pool wasn't part of the hotel. I didn't want to use it as it wasn't private enough (that's just me - there were people laid beside it). It's not all bad though. The service was exceptional - very warm and friendly and personal. We never had any issues with service in any way, but we never do at W properties. The Bliss products used in the rooms are very good, and there are like 6 different products they give you each day which is great. We also loved the special multiple-charger station which had about 10 different connections to charge your phone or camera etc and the iPod dock beside the bed (seems to be standard at most hotels these days). Overall I wouldnt stay again - it just didnt seem homely like some hotels are. I did like the party feel of the hotel - it's basically a nightclub not a hotel but it just wasn't wow-ing enough for me. I wouldn't recommend against staying here, but I wouldn't be recommending it like I would with some other LA hotels.", "Date": "April 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, California", "Title": "\u201cNot sure if there is anything wrong with this place\u201d", "Author": "bsetting", "ReviewID": "UR104950348", "Content": "The W has amazing service, exception taste, a great lobby, comfortable beds, spacious rooms, a subway station beneath it and amazing restaurants and night clubs around it.

They even have a special room service menu for us furry types. As for you human-type visitors, take the time to learn about your hotel and its location! This is a very hip, modern hotel--great for young couples or singles, NOT families! Hollywood has become a nightlife hot-spot, and lots of locals go to the W Hollywood for the clubs (Drai's, the pool, the outdoor Hollywood Station lounge, the Living Room lobby) and to eat at Delphine. It is a see-and-be-seen kind of place. Visitors should keep in mind, however, that Hollywood is still gritty in parts and not completely gentrified. LA also has the largest population of homeless in the USA (well, where would you live if you had no home?), which is something beyond the hotel's control. The security in the lobby and the elevators make sure street traffic doesn't bother guests at the W. The Rooms: The W decor is modern minimalism with a neutral palette. Everything is brand-new and super clean. The bed was ultra comfortable. The window seat was a nice touch, even if the view from Room 320 is of the valet parking area. Noise from there was minimal, but echoed. Room wasn't huge, but enough to move around. The Bliss bath products are great (and so's the spa) and the walk-in shower is spacious. I wish there was a tub, though. If I had to complain about anything, the lighting (the bathroom in particular) was dim. The noise from the hallways was loud (keep it down, people!). The clock radio/iPod dock did not work. The phone on the desk only worked in Speaker mode. Those are little things that need to be checked and fixed regularly. The extras are also pricey- $9 for a lg bottle of Figi water, a $25 face mask sample by the sink. My Blackberry, which gets excellent reception anywhere else in H'wood, could not get a 3G signal in my room. The only free WiFi is in the lobby. Breakfast room service was fast and delish. Great French press of coffee. All the staff I encountered were very friendly and excellent, to both of us (furry and non-furry). **There is a locals-only rate, which is a great bargain.

This hotel is located in one of the worst areas in Hollywood. DO NOT WALK AROUND AT NIGHT. Its very run down and crime ridden. Ok, I checked in and was upgraded to what I was told was the best suite in the hotel, room 1101. Great, so I had to wait for the room to be ready, but it was fine and got all checked in. The room itself was huge and pretty cool. Very modern interior and nice ammenities. Had excellent views of LA and the bathroom was big with a tub in the middle of the room. All great. I settled in and did some work, there is free internet if you are a platinum member, and its very fast (not common of any hotel). So from here on out, it went down hill. The room is not very insulated. You can hear the outside traffic and street noise. I was down on the end of the hall, but could still hear people outside walking around. I took a shower and there was no water pressure what so ever. I am use to it, but something that should be addressed. I went to bed at around 10:45pm. At around 11:00pm I heard some huge thumping and super loud music. I thought it was a car outside, but it would not stop. I finally realized that it was coming from upstairs. It was so loud that I could barely think. It just got ouder and louder. The bass was so bad that the glass and furniture in the room were rattling. I called down and was told that there was a club, literely above my head, and it goes to 3am. Its called Drais?? The girl was nice enough to offer my earplugs, but that was she could not do anything. I told her, BS, and spoke to someone else. They were confused and thought I new about this club and the noise. I had to tell them that I had no clue and was here for business, not clubbing, and needed to sleep. They finally agreed to move me to the 10th floor. So I packed my stuff and moved. I got to the floor and I was amazed. It was just a normal room, but it was still SUPER loud. Not as bad as the 11th floor, but still loud. I called again and told that I had to come the lobby. I get to the lobby and it was super loud there too. They have a lobby bar and it was crazy. I had to yell to the manager about my problem. They finally gave me a room on the 5th floor. It now way past midnight and I got my new key and headed back. I was then stopped by security and asked me where I was going? I told him to my room. He told me wait as there was too many people around trying to get upstairs?? I was blown away. I said I was guest and just wanted to go to my room. He stated \"too bad\". I then said I would just get a manager, then he said, OK, go ahead. WTF?? I checked out that next morning and was given points from my troubles.. Points dont cut it here.

If you are a business traveler, SPG member, or looking for a quite weekend, avoid this place, its not worth it.

Throw in celebrity guests and a live band in the lobby and you've got the W Hollywood. I had a chance to stay here for 4 days and was impressed by the vibe and attitude of the place. It's very new and is breaking new ground in a once-seedy section of Hollywood. There's still the old-school walk of fame sidewalk and dive bars (the iconic Frolic Room across the street) nearby but the newly-built W condos and soon to be built luxury project across the street promise a definite upgrade for the neighborhood. TIP: Book this hotel through a wesite called Magellan Travel and save hundreds. We stayed here for $170 a night, at least a $100 off the rack rate. Speaking of upgrades, I was upgraded to a suite (I'm SPG Platinum) that was maybe the largest that I have ever stayed in. It featured an all white, 60s retro cool look with a circular couch, a mid-room curtain and electric shades. The all marble bathroom was larger than 2 normal hotel baths. Very impressive but I was annoyed by the bottles of booze, snacks, water, clothes, etc. with price tags on them scattered about. SPG- stop trying to sell me stuff. The lobby is spectacular, with high ceilings, a sweeping staircase and a bar scene that was lively. We were there during a Sunday night jazz promotion where the lobby was turned into a club-like scene and there was a glitzy turn out by the guests and locals. The disco on the top floor is apparently a hot spot, as there was a line of the young and the beautiful waiting behind the velvet ropes for the elevator to the club every night. TIP: Avoid any of the top floors near the disco if you want a quiet room. One night, the manager had a Gold/Platinum reception at the lobby bar, which are usually lame, but this was an open bar and a nice touch. The manger and his assistant were chatty and nice guys to talk to. Upon checking out, I had some problems with items on my bill that I had to argue with the clerk about (free movies that I was charged for, internet access on more than one laptop in my room, etc.) and it took a few calls to SPG and the hotel accounting department to get them deducted.

I am a 30 year old young professional that am pretty amiable to whatever scene I am in- but for some reason the staff at W Hollywood thought they were better then anyone, infact I was told to leave my seat in the \"Living Room\" because if it was reserved for I'm assuming more important people- I mean c'mon it's a freakin Hotel Lobby- if they wanted me to buy a bottle- that could of been done easily.

I liked the decor which is fabulous. The front desk service was very good. I was lucky to stay on SPG cash and points so you cannot complain. It was a fabulous deal. I liked the restaurant in the hotel called Delfina or something like that. The breakfast was good. When you stay in a nice hotel you know that the food and anemiites aren't going to be \"cheap\" so I found the restaurant food very good. We had a lovely brunch and because it was lunch time, the hotel had a \"card\" for a dessert which the host gave me and it was fabulous. Having the SPG card is great when you stay at the Starwood property because we received a gift of 2 small bottles of fiji water a day which was nice. There was coffee in the morning also complimentary. Though we didn't use it, there was a 1 time car service with Acura or something like that. Quite nice. The area isn't what I had hoped but then again, I never stayed in Hollywood. We did walk around but mainly LA is a driving town. If you do drive, the car valet is almost $40 a day which is typical but to me that's like 2 nice cocktails so for 5 nights, the $200 not including all the tips was as bit of a sole point but that is typical and I only wish there was a self park option but we were told there was not. The roof top pool is awesome. Even though it was December we did lay out. We were there was one lovely couple and it felt like we owned the world. The design looks like something you would see in the TV show Entourage....all cool. I do have photos but I don't have time to post but it really is a nicely designed space. One strange thing I noticed...we don't get our shampoo or soap replaced. I think its all part of the green movement but it's so embarrassing to call the front desk to request soap, shampoo, etc. I wish they would just give it to you. And lastly, I love the closet with the automatic light. The nice dryer in the room, and the built in tv. There is a small mini bar and we actually never do this but one night we just \"went\" for it and splurged. It was fun. The bed is low but quite nice. Must say - great place.

On the positive, the staff attitude and helpfulness was outstanding. The only shortcoming is not enough front desk staff and long long waits to check in or get service or even ask a question. The rooms were very stylish, yet comfortable and spotlessly clean, but I do miss having a soaking tub. Handy to have all the chargers and outlets on the desk, so you don't have to fumble through your bag to pull yours out. On the negative, there are no coffeemakers in the room, so to just get coffee ($8) on the menu was $17 after taxes, service charges and tip and $9 for in room water. I went to Trader Joes around the back of the hotel and stocked up for breakfast rather than overpay. The parking was $38/day with no discounts for guests. I pay less in Manhattan. Also, the pool area did not have a single lounge chair for sunning, but lots of cabanas, for which I am sure they charge for rental. Also, internet was $15/day, which is excessive, especially for US hotels.I would stay again, but bring my own food supplies, since even though I am on an expense account, I hate to feel that I am being ripped off just because they can. I was on the upper floors and could hear the disco at night, but I turned the Heat/AC fan to high and that helped drown the sound out.

The W Hollywood is a beautifully designed hotel with spacious, modern rooms. The clientelle tends to be primarily in their 20's and 30's (with a lot of money to spend it seems as this is not an inexpensive hotel). The hotel's Drai nightclub is a major draw and there lies the problem in trying to get a good night's sleep. Nightly at about 3 AM when the club closes you'll either be hearing the ruckus outside the hotel or in the hallway outside your room from those who had one too many drinks. We had to call security on more than one occasion during our stay. I'd suggest bringing heavy duty earplugs if sleep is important to you during your stay. That being said we did find the staff very courteous and extremely helpful especially those that worked the concierge desk. We appreciated the use of a nicely equipped gym but the rooftop swimming pool is more of a \"set design piece\" than a pool you can actually use. To enjoy your first cup of coffee of the day one needs to make the trek down to the lobby to get it as the rooms are not equipped with coffee machines. We did eventually ask for a coffee maker for the room and they were nice enough to provide one but they had to be reminded daily to provide the coffee for it. The location of the hotel was convenient for our purposes but the neighbourhood as such left a lot to be desired (unless you're looking for a tattoo parlour that is, there are lots of them in the area). So would I recommend this hotel? yes and no. It all depends on what you're looking for.

The banquet staff who worked on our event was exceptional - Donald, Cat and Daniel. Nothing was ever an obstacle even with the ever changing number of meals needed. They were so amazingly accommodating. And Albert was just the answer to everything. Never failed to help me out with whatever I needed. And a special thanks to Michael who took care of specific requests and needs and they just kind of happened. It's like asking the wizard and poof - DONE! Chantelle really came through for me with the short notice that I had with all the changes in our corporate schedule. I'm thankful that Chantelle was able to find us a meeting space and going through the contract phase with ease. And a special thanks to Jacky who really made everything easy from the moment we got on the phone to discuss BEOs and through the entire execution stage of the event. She was such a great help with the issues in space (our attendance grew) and all the other additional things outside of the actual event. Which definitely made getting through the weekend much easier for me. The entire front desk, housekeeping, valet, everyone was just a delight. I can say that the team at Hollywood truly does take the W's motto of \"whatever, whenever\" to heart and own it. Also the PSAV at this property were just fantastic and so quick to react to any glitches as they do happen. I just wanted to express my appreciation of having had such a great experience and congratulate the W Hollywood in having such an excellent team. Especially for one that is fairly new! Kudos!

Thought this was great and could not wait to stay there. When we arrived check in was fine. We had flown from New York at 5am so we settled down for an early night. But sadly until about 1am the room next door was playing thumping music and girls were screaming - I was actually really concerned that our room backed onto the club (as I heard they had a night club), I went out into the hall to investigate and no, it was all coming from a room next door. I could hear the lyrcis to each song they were playing through my ear plugs it was that loud. The next night those guests must have left but then we heard the music from the club/bar. no sleep again. I wanted to cry, we were out sightseeing all day and just wanted a decent nights sleep but did not get one during our stay. We did not venture to the rooftop pool or the club as once we saw the type of people that were going in, we felt we were not 'glam' enough and had heard stories from other guests that they had to wait at the rope just to get back into the hotel. it was all a bit pretencious with the red rope and loads of glammed up people despearatly trying to get into the club/pool- we left them to it. Location-wise, no really the best, depends what you want to see. We would stay over in West Hollywood next time or at the Beach. Once you leave the doors of the hotel you are right above the Hollywood/Vine station - which was great. What was not so great is that as soon as you get out of those doors you have homeless people asking you for money and ciggerettes - really opened my eyes to the real Hollyoowd. On our first evening we walked from the hotel to Hollywood/Highland. On the way (20 min walk) we saw one guy get arrseted, a police helicopter swooping over, the shops literally were all smoke shops, tour shop, sex shops and so on.....we did not walk back at night but got the subway as we did not really feel that safe. Servcie from the hotel - well non existant for us.We had a call on our last night from the conceirge/whatever, whenever guy asking if there was anything we needed? Was a bit late as we were checking out in the morning. On check out I knew we had not spent a penny at the hotel (would you buy a small bottle of water for $10?). The lady on the desk gave me a piece of paper with 'amount to be charged - 0' and said 'all good to go'. I thought that was it, no charge as I had pre-paid the room. Got in taxi and checked again, I had been charged $188 for Spa treatments I had never had! I had to phone the hotel 6 times and no one ever called me back apart from after 6 calls, a lovely lady from their finance dept. Guy on the desk was poor, Spa employees were poor, everytime someone took my number and said they would get back to me but never did. One guy on the desk even gave me the Spa's number but when I rang it was for Madam ussauds in Hollywood? I finally got my money back onto credit card a week later but am not lumbered with \u00c2\u00a335 worth of mobile phone charges.

We stayed in a \"Wonderful\" room on the 5th floor; room and bathroom were modern and spotless and included a 42 inch plasma, ipod docking station, European platform bed, circularmini bar and window seat: all very chic.

All these great features are easily tarnished by poor customer service. The W heavily advertises use of their \"Acura Experience\", which is a complimentary short-distance car service provided by the hotel. So, my fiance and I rang the hotel after we made our room booking to reserve this car service. We were told that since we were 3 weeks out from our arrival, the service car could not be booked that far in advance and we were told to ring back within a week to 3 days of our arrival to reserve this service.\u00e2\u20ac\u00a8\u00e2\u20ac\u00a8No problem. I rang the W 6 days before our arrival and spoke with concierge. We had a lengthy conversation about the car service, I explained that we wanted to reserve it for 7pm on our arrival day, and concierge couldn't be happier booking this for us. We even chatted about the venue my fiance and I were attending. I was repeatedly told that \"you're good to go, just visit the Acura desk in the lobby at 7pm for pick-up.\" Upon our arrival, in a nutshell: 1. The car was not reserved for us, they had no record of my reservation and was now fully booked for the evening; 2. Conceirge \u00e2\u20ac\u0153vaguely\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd remembered our conversation. He then told us that we would be mistaken to think that it would be booked, since: a. Bookings can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be made over the phone, they can only be made in person and on the day at the desk (?) and; b. Even if he wanted to make the booking for us, he would have had to transfer us to the Acura desk (which contradicts his first point) 3. After 25 minutes, all we were told was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sorry for the misunderstanding\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. No remedy was offered, such as a taxi voucher or that our parking be comped for what clearly was not our fault. My fiance and I suggested these options but we were told that the hotel cannot do either. 4. After requesting to speak with a manager, who so happened to be standing nearby and listening to the whole conversation, we were finally (begrudgingly) offered a taxi voucher. 5. The next morning we were told by the front desk at check out that the parking had be waived out of courtesy, which we appreciated. However, my fiance and I discovered two days later that our credit card had been charged by the hotel for the parking. 6. I rang the hotel to fix this, and after explaining the story I was told \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see any reason why we should remove the parking.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd I asked to speak to a manager and then after a minute on hold I was told it would be removed (did they remember me all of a sudden?) 7. After speaking with SPG customer service about the whole affair, my fiance and I received a very nice, apologetic email from their head office, which admitted to poor service during our stay. In good faith, we were given complimentary rewards points. Summary: Being forced to believe that their error was a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153misunderstanding\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on our part, which it was clearly anything but, was disappointing from such a high calibre hotel.

Mainly, the racket of Drai's kind of makes this place less chill to stay at and seems to bring in a particularly Chachi clientele. There were lines to get into the pool, club, and even the lobby at night. We had drinks in the lobby one night, where friends who live in LA waited in line to have a cocktail with us in the lobby. We attempted to go to the outside space of the lobby once they got through the first line only to find another velvet rope and line to get to the outside part of the lobby, and even found a line that we had to wait in when we tried to leave. We had to wait for someone to open the velvet rope to leave! My friends and I immediately left and went to a more chill bar in Hollywood.

Having just returned from a trip to L.A I have to admit that I heartily agree with so many of the previous reviews on this hotel. It's 'style' (if you like that kind of thing) over comfort every step of the way here. We've stayed in Starwwod Hotels worldwide and this had to be our least favourite experience. The staff were 'fine' but certainly didn't go out of their way to help and more thought had gone into appearance than substance throughout the hotel. It started off well - we'd requested a quiet room (having read previous reviews) and we got one no problem so don't stress, all you have to do is ask. Great. And to be fair, it was quiet althought possibly the air conditioning hid all outside noise! The room itself however wasn't the kind of place you'd want to spend a lot of time. We always judge a room by whether you would be comfortable if you were taken ill there and with the 'W' the answer would most certainly be a resounding 'NO'. The bed isn't quite a futon but if you have a bad back, forget it. There is only one chair at table height so unless you're alone, don't order room service although the waiter's comment was 'oh I love to recline to eat when I'm in a hotel' - what ? To eat soup ???!!! The window seat is very comfortable though so not all bad. Interesting placement of hand towels in bathroom doesn't seem entirely hygenic to say the least! I'll leave it at that on that point. Complimentary Acura service - I'm sure it's very nice but it only has a 4 mile radius and no-one seemed able to tell us which areas that covered so forget it unless you know exactly where you're going or have a map of your own. Car park attendants - unless you're dressed up to the nines expect to be largely ignored (unless aforementioned glamour puss takes pity on you and admits you were there first) Lighting - what is it about this place (and, to be fair, the rest of this city)?? Are they all vampires??? Mega dim lighting everywhere was quite bizarre. - feel like you're in a nightclub just walking up the corridor Location of hotel - right next to Metro which is very handy but the area outside seemed to be a favourite haunt of the local down and outs and there was a delightful aroma whenever you left the hotel. Again , I'll say no more on that. In a nutshell this was our first, and will definitely be our last, visit to a 'W'.

It was our first vacation together, so I wanted everything to go well. I contacted Jim, the GM, to ask him to set up something special for my boyfriend through their Whatever/Whenever service - my boyfriend is a huge brownie addict and I wanted to get some specialty pastries and a quart of milk delivered to the room when we checked in. Jim went above and beyond - he had Jonathan from the W/W Concierge set up the order with a wonderful pastry chef, and asked me to send a picture of myself and my boyfriend to him so that they could have the brownies set up in our room as we were checking in (sidenote: we were also given a complimentary room upgrade!) Everything went as planned, and my boyfriend was extremely surprised and delighted. And the pastries? They were AMAZING. We also asked Jonathan about setting up a chauffered limo to take us and two of my friends around LA for a nighttime tour, since my boyfriend had never seen the city. We were given a number of options and they took care of everything for us. The driver was phenomenal and went out of his way to point out places of interest, knowing John had never visited before. We had massages at the Bliss Spa - and both our masseuses were up to the quality I expected from the W. They were professional and thoughtful in their approaches to each of our needs, and the brownie bar was a fabulous touch. Finally, I have to say, all the people complaining about the quality of their sleep at this hotel... I don't know if it's because of where our room was or not, but we didn't hear one PEEP from either other guests or the nightclub during our stay. We had the best nights' sleep of our whole relationship in this room - and that's saying something, because John has very bad arthritis and usually has to get up once or twice a night to stretch. He didn't move once at all during sleep, and we both woke up refreshed and ready for whatever the day was bringing.

Beautiful lobby, outer couryard that turns into a bar at night with a huge projection tv screen (they were showing the football game). Everything is very clean and new which is wonderful - esp. in Hollywood where 'good' clean and reasonable hotels are hard to come by - esp. so close to the chinese theatre area if you are looking for the touristy stuff. However, I have to agree with other posters - I wonder if the staff are aspiring models or actors and are just there to make connections? They are certainly not as helpful as other W hotels we have stayed in (or other 4 - 5 star hotels in general). We drove. When we pulled in the valet automatically came and took our car. We said \"we're just checking in\" and the valet said \"that's fine - I'll go park your car\". When we asked how much it was they said $38 with in-and-out privileges. We asked if there was self-park and they said no self park in the hotel -but you could self park across the street but there was no in and out. When we asked at check in they said that yes you could park across the street for $10 for the day (from 6 am up until 3 am - although the front desk didn't tell us this - they just said \"yes,you can park there\" - it was the ppl at the parking lot that gave us the times) and an extra $10 for overnight (if you were going to be there between 3 am and 6 am). Had we not asked the valet would never have told us this - just taken our car - and the lot is LITERALLY across the street. The valet must take the cars there because I don't know where would be closer? We ended up parking there and when we asked at the lot they said that you COULD go in and out. Also, the pool closes at 7:00 as it turns into a bar later in the night. If you have kids or if you just want to swim you can only go until 7 and then they will close everything down and reopen it later. We werent told about this when we checked in. We weren't even told there was a pool or anything about the hotel. It's only when I saw people in the elevator in bathings suits that they told me they are trying to get a quick swim in as the pool would be closing at 7. We ran up just to take a peek at the pool before it closed and figured we would come back later for a drink as we were on our way out. When we came back at around 9:00 and tried to go up for a drink we were told that it was a bar that was not 'associated' with the hotel and the cover is $20 a person to get up (they lock off the elevators so you have to put your key in to get to the rooms and the key doesn't work to get you to the pool after 7 - you have to enter through the bar elavator). The guy at the front that was with the W said \"oh yes, we make sure and tell all our guests that there is a cover - even if you are a guest\". Well, the woman who checked us in never said anything about it. We weren't going to bother paying $40 just to get upstairs as we weren't going to stay long - we just wanted a quick drink and to see the place as we didn't have time earlier. So know this before you go - we wish we did we would have planned better. Also, in the past the cds that they give out in the room were complimentary. We took ours to listen to in the car as we've enjoyed the music on these. When we checked out (early the next morning - so too early to see the pool again) of course the guy at the front asked \"how was your stay\" and I said \"great, except for not being told about the pool turning into a bar and the cover charge\" and he said \"oh, sorry about that - she should have said something\" and that was it. Then I realized I had the cd in the car so ran it back in and said \"I forgot I took this from the room - do you charge for them? Can i just leave it here with you?\" and he said \"yes, there is a charge, if it's missing from the room you will be billed, would you like to purchase it?\" (and it wasn't that great compared to other cd plus by now I just thought \"geez - the least you coulda done was offer to let me keep the lousy cd after the whole pool mix-up\") so I said \"no thanks - if you can just put it back for me\". But come on? That's not \"4 star\" treatment and not treatment I expect from the W which in the past has been so into customer service. So again, be careful if you 'take' the cd by mistake. Also, like with many hotels, the mini fridge items are on sensors, so they will charge you if you move anything (even if you don't consume it and leave it back but take it out) - so make sure and check your bill if you use the minbar to make sure they didn't charge you for more than you took just because you moved stuff. That being said it is a really nice property. You can't beat the \"newness\" of it. Like I said - there's not much of a selection down there in Hollywood. (we've been a few times on business so stayed in a number of hotels there - including the \"haunted\" Roosevelt hotel - yuck). This is by far the nicest one in the area - unless you want to go all the way over to Beverly Hills and stay at the Luxe or somewhere like that. But it is a bit of a hike. The metro is connected to the hotel if you aren't driving so it's really convenient - and if you are driving - like I said - just self park - it's really easy. It's a 1 minute drive to the freeway which is also really handy. We took the kids to Universal Studios and it was about a 5 minute drive - but so much handier than the Universal hotels as it's so close to the Walk of Fame and the new city area they recently built. And nicer than any Sheraton or Marriott or other hotels closer to Universal. We've been to Hollywood without kids and yes, the W hotel would be more fun without kids (like, we could actually stay for a longer drink ...) but it's also fine with kids. I didn't feel out of place having my kids there and I saw lots of other kids there. My only other problem is I booked a \"fabulous\" room and as an SPG member I'm entitled to an upgrade to the next level which would be some sort of suite. Having the kids I really wanted something a bit bigger than just 2 double beds but the girl at the front said \"no, sorry, the next level up from what you booked are the suites, and we only have 8 suites in the whole hotel and they are all booked\". EIGHT suites in the whole hotel? That didin't sound right. But maybe I'm just projecting because I'm still bitter about the pool ;-) . I thought the 'fabulous' room would have had 2 beds and a couch area to give a bit more space but she said all the rooms are exactly the same (except for having either 2 queens or 1 king) except for the 8 suites. hmmmmm ... seems strange in such a big hotel. Also, all the views from the rooms aren't good. They face the parking lot, or street - no rooms face the hollywood sign or anything which is to be expected as the hotel is right in the town and the rooms aren't high enough to give much of a view. Just a point if a view is really important to you. As another poster said, the rooftop would have nice views ... just not the rooms. I paid $155 so I was really pleased for that rate - but it still doesn't excuse the lack of service. If I paid close to $300 as I know the rates can get that high I would have been really mad. But for one night - close enough to get to the sights, comfy bed, clean and really fun lobby and vibe - totally worth it. Esp. with the cheap parking across the street. If you plan on going for the nighlife be warned about the cover and plan for it - or just plan to stay by the lobby bar - it's nice there too - and was busy. Yes, it can get loud - so be warned and ask for a room away from the bar as it stays open till 3:30 if you don't want the noise.

We finished off a 2 night stay at the W after spending a week in Vegas. I really enjoyed this hotel and it has been my favourite over the last six 4+* US hotels I've stayed in. Yes it is a little pretentious with all the ropes and bouncers but it is in Hollywood. I loved the design of the hotel and the rooms are beautifully furnished. However I wasn't fond of the glass window dividing the shower and beds and thought this was a bit much for a shared queen room. Check in was great - loved the girl at the desk. She was very warm and friendly and thankfully gave us an early check in at 11:30. I had booked through Hotwire after working out it would be the W and there was no problems with upgrading us to a double queen room. I thought this may have been a problem as when I tried to book through their direct website it stated that a double queen room was not available for the dates specified! So it was a big bonus! We hadn't decided if we were going to use their valet parking (a bit pricey at $35 a day when there is a car park across the street) but upon check in and entering our room, the concierge rang to inform us that they had removed our bags from the car and were bringing them straight up. We hadn't even asked for this so it was very nice to not have to worry about it. They then did valet our car and the service for this was wonderful. There were also a few times when we arrived back from some shopping and parked out the front with a line of people waiting for entry and we wouldn't even be required to show our instant access passes, and would just receive a welcome back! with an immediate opening of the ropes.

If this was a general review for style, location, amenities compared to say the Holiday Inns of this world, I would give it a higher rating. Upon hours of travel I arrived and went up to my room (no one even offered to help with my bags once they got them to the lobby, which was odd, but I could handle it). The room itself is similar in design to other Ws, so was nice, but the view was of an ugly parking lot. The lighting is mood lighting meaning even with every light on, you can't really see, which for a business traveler is not ideal, though typical of these trendy-style hotels. The main place the lighting bothered me was in the bathroom. I think that room should at least be bright enough to put in my contacts without struggling, but the mood lighting extended to the bathroom. A few minutes after I arrived a man came in to check on restocking the room and fridge; I thought this should have been handled prior to my check-in. He came back 10 minutes later, forgetting he had already done my room. The internet connection didn't work at first even though it charged me so I had to go down and talk to the front desk who refunded my money and I reconnected. So my first half an hour set the tone. After that it was just minor service things. My floor towel was never replaced in the 4 days I was there and had a big black shoe print, obviously from the housekeeper, on it all 4 days (in general, the cleaning job was sub-par). I never got new moisturizer despite using it up (though they did replace shampoo etc. which I didn't need). Room service didn't bring milk for my tea; upon calling to have them remove my tray one night they never came. My colleague had a broken toilet upon check-in; her in-room checkout was broken (she was only there 1 night and only in the room to sleep so these were annoyances in a brief stay). These are little things but are a-typical of what service level I have been treated to at other Ws or the other similar class hotels. I had good experiences at Delfine - nice servers and when one made 2 minor mistakes he treated us to 2 free desserts to make up, which was nice. The food/wine was pretty good and outside was nice though the inside atmosphere is a bit dull. The hotel concierges were friendly though I didn't rely on them for much. I agree with other reviewers re: Drai's. You should think of this as Drai's nightclub with an associated hotel and not the W hotel with Drai's nightclub. I find it rude and annoying that getting back into my hotel at night the bouncers (even on the parking side of the hotel) treated hotel guests a bit rudely and I had to queue up (!) and show my room key at multiple ropes inside & out just to get through to my room. Also, as there were private events daily while I was there, this closes off one of the hotel entrances I would have used out onto Hollywood Blvd. Hotel guests have to exit via \"the back door\" into parking lot like 2nd class citizens. They seem to be running a successful club, but I think the effort put into the hotel service (in relation to other Ws) is dubious. This hotel would have been nice if I was there for a clubbing weekend but if you are not going to have a fun weekend partying at Drai's, there are much better hotels in the same class and price range.", "Date": "August 2, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Charleston, South Carolina", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel, not designed for kids\u201d", "Author": "JMBax", "ReviewID": "UR73315236", "Content": "We've stayed at several W hotels and have always been impressed with the hotels, lobbies, and rooms.

It's beautiful, and the location is amazing, and contrary to what I've read, I received great service from everyone from the front desk to the concierge (who we utilized several times) to the bellman. We were able to get into Drai's after a bit of a wait on Thursday, we found it nice enough but not someplace we HAD to return to. When I requested a song of the DJ I was very rudly shot down. As I work as a DJ myself I never would have said what he said to a patron. The songs I requested were right in line with what he was actually playing, so Drai's did not really impress us. We actually turned down an invitation to return on Fri evening. The room was very nice and ultra modern although I kept banging my right shin on the edge of the platform bed, I still have the bruises. But the reason why I don't see myself returning was the noise at night. You hear EVERYTHING from doors closing to regular conversations from all directions. After a rather sleepless Thursday I asked the front desk for earplugs which I was shocked to see she had right onhand, prepackaged and ready to go! However Sat night the earplugs did nothing to mask the people who decied that the hallway outside our room was the place to party at 3am. At first I politely poked my head outside to the couple who sat on the floor in bathrobes with food and drinks laid out picnic style in front of them and asked if they would mind taking it inside as we were trying to sleep. They apoligized, then moved maybe 5 feet away and keep on their conversation. After that I called the front desk and explained the situation. Their reply was not an apology but to ask if I had earplugs. After I explained they weren't making a dent they sent up security. I was prepared for a party hotel, as I've stayed in several other W's including Mahatten but nothing prepared me for the noice level at night. We were on the 10th floor and could hear the nighclub two floors up quite well. Of the 3 nights I was there, I didn't sleep for two of them. At checkout when they asked how my stay was I relayed the above. They took my info and promised a manager would be in touch right away but so far I have not heard anything.

A reading light. Which did not exist in the lamp above the chair. I'd rate what was there at 40 to 60 watts. So I called down to the desk.

After waiting in the \"special\" hotel line for 45 minutes and seeing that people were getting in ahead of her she finally asked why and was told she wasn't \"HOT\" enough. At that point I asked at the desk if there at least was another pool that we could all go to and relax after this experience and they said there was not. Now regardless of whether or not Drai's is their own special entity they are still connected with the hotel and guests should be treating accordingly . I certainly don't feel I should pay to stay at a high end hotel and have my daughter insulted in this manner. In addition, this is California, and people expect use of a pool. If the pool is not for use at a particular time they should al least have another pool for clients to use with a shuttle service.

It annoyed me after a long day of traveling or sight seeing to have to elbow through a crowd to get to the front of a roped off area and show a card to be able to get into a hotel I paid good money to stay in. (How about a separate entrance?). A nice touch was the young man with the clipboard looking us up and down (granted we were dressed very casually for a concert at the Hollywood Bowl) and saying \"Can I help you?\" with a tone indicating that we were obviously not going to be let in. Also lacking was attention to small details. For instance, we were at one point informed that the Acura car service would take us up to 5 miles from the hotel--only to be informed after making plans to use it that it could only take us 2 miles during certain times of the day--we needed to go 2.3 miles but the 2 mile rule was apparently set in stone. Also, we requested a high room to avoid traffic noise. We avoided the traffic noise on the 11th floor, but we could hear the bass from the nightclub for hours that night--it would have been nice if the person who noted our request had informed us that we might be better off on a lower floor.

Well I can honestly say that the negative reviews are way off base. We checked in on Friday of the July 4 long weekend and was in our hotel room within minutes after a long day at Universal Studios. The rooms are impecably clean, and have yummy spa products and a huge rain shower head...my boyfriend literally showered 3 times in one day!!! It was like a mini spa. The bed was heaven after exploring LA during the days and the maids did an awesome job tidying our rooms and providing fresh towels and linens and of course refilling the spa products! There is anything you could want in the room from Figi water to grey goose vodka even with a martini shaker and of course lots of yummy treats! Our room was on the third floor facing the Living Room Lounge and was a bit loud into the night...but I called \"Whatever/Whenever\" for ear plugs and shortly fell asleep. The other nights we didn't seem to notice...but perhaps may have been due to the fatigue or wine consumption... Overall every inch of the hotel is spotless and stunning to look at. All of the staff were very friendly to us and didn't feel it was an act. The valet was easy, we never had to wait for our car (but usually called ahead from the room). The much anticipated line to pass to enter the hotel from Hollywood Blvd was not an issue....ever. We were greated pleasantly and almost escorted to the door. We also had no problem getting past the line to go to Drai's as there is a seperate line inside the hotel for guests. When asked who to talk to for access into the club a staff member directed us to Chris Nelson...who actually existed and was right on his word to get into the club! Also there is a seperate elevator to Drai's and the pool during the day for non hotel guests. The pool scene was pretty chill...not a big pool but the fun of it is that its on the roof!! There is a pool party during the day on Sundays that we weren't interested in going to, but I had asked the doorman if we had to pay or wait in the line and he pleasantly replied \"No mam! Just put your suit on and go have some fun!\". This hotel stands out for service in the details....there is a car service that will take you anywhere in the LA vicinity and we really enjoyed that service for a ride to Madeo. We were considering on not keeping our reservation for dinner as did not want to taxi or drive there, but after being offered a complimentary ride how could you turn that down!!! We didn't eat in any of the restaurants but did order room service for dessert and of course it was delicious. There is complimentary coffee in the lobby in the mornings which was very nice. We also used the gym and had great workouts!! Lots of equipment and top of the line cardio machines with personal TV's and plenty of water to hydrate. Overall this hotel far exceeded our expectations in every way! I don't know how anyone could not enjoy this hotel!

The room was fantastic, everything about the place screams \"Sexy Hollywood\"...my only issue is with the shower, because let's face it, we aren't all here to perform. Some of us are just on holiday with friends and do not see it necessary to have to shower in plain view of others. Yes, this is what each and every room at the W offers you. A glass shower that offers a floor to ceiling window view right out into the bedroom area. Sure, the glass is 'frosted' from about your knees to your chest but let's just say it's not frosted ENOUGH! And even if you aren't in the bathroom to use the shower, whatever it is you are doing in there, whether you're on the toilet, brushing your teeth, changing clothes, you won't be doing any of this in privacy (unless you are staying alone) because if no one is in the shower, we get a clear view of whatever is going on there. If this doesn't bother you than you're all set. Our solution was to tape Madame Tussauds brochures all over the bathroom window. Didn't expect to have to add tape and miscelaneous brochures to my shopping list, but hey, over all, it turned out to be a minor inconvenience. This is my only complaint.

Avoid.\u201d", "Author": "foiegras99", "ReviewID": "UR68883699", "Content": "As a regular W customer with SPG status, I often stay in W hotels. I was working in LA, so we booked a group of 4 of us (3 of us SPG gold card holders) into the W Hotel Hollywood. W is considered an aspirational brand, and most W hotels are fun, funky and supposed to be trendy. This hotel seemed to have its very own ego. Walking past the disinterested doorman (roped off, presumably to \"keep the riff-raff out\"?), upon entry they require guests to deposit $500 on a credit card (yes, $500!) even if your room & tax are pre-paid. Now one of our party didn't have $500 left on his card, and had arrived a day earlier while we made our way to LA. The hotel staff were quite happy to send him back out into the street without negotiation (even though his room had been pre-paid!). Thankfully (though after a lot of persuasion to largely deaf ears) we were able to use one of our own cards over the phone to place the deposit. Why they couldn't have just taken a smaller deposit of $150 or held his passport until we arrived, I do not know. Perhaps they were expecting him to steal the TV? This made us look bad as the colleague in question was working for us, and was technically under our hospitality. Not a nice experience after a 10 hour long haul flight. A day later the rest of the party arrived and checked in. Well, we tried. Despite having high status with SPG and it being nearly 4pm, our rooms were not ready. We were offered a room DOWNGRADE (note that normally you are offered an upgrade) if we needed to check into our rooms, which we did. We took the room downgrade as we were working at night at a concert. I would have expected to have some kind of credit applied to my room ($20 or so or a free drink? Would have made me feel a lot happier about the experience). At the outside bar we ordered snacks from a waitress that can only be described as indifferent and obnoxious, firing verbal abuse at our party when we were annoyed at slow service. Once the bill arrived, we discovered why - service is added to all bills. Normally in the USA service in restaurants and bars is impeccable, because the staff have to work for it. Not here - they get it added anyway, so there is no need to go the extra mile as they do in the rest of LA. My experience of the W hotel Hollywood has tarnished the whole W brand for me. Thankfully I understand SPG hotels are owned by different companies - important as I would not want to give any more of my money to this particular organisation. I have stayed in W Hotels cities all over the USA and never had a problem. I should point out at this point that the rooms in the West Hollywood W are extremely nice. Comfortable beds etc. It is the staff that let the hotel down (and the whole W brand nationally as a result), with their snobby attitude towards guests. Totally unnecessary, and to think we PAID to stay there. Surely you pay to be treated with respect in a hotel, and equally guests should respect the staff? It is even an effort to get in and out of the hotel, with guests treated as rather incidental to the whole \"party scene\" of the property. There is more. My friend ordered room service and received completely the wrong order, and I was charged 3 times for internet access despite being there for under 24 hours. Thankfully after having to ask twice, this was removed, as was the room service charge. Will the management contact me to resolve this? I seriously doubt it. It takes something for me to take the time and effort to complain, but I shall be on the phone to SPG to let them know of my experience. The sad thing is that this hotel will always be successful anyway, due to it being a W in Hollywood, so the company likely has absolutely no interest in whether customers are happy or not.", "Date": "June 27, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Leiria, Portugal", "Title": "\u201cW Hollywood isn't really an hotel...\u201d", "Author": "Ruimmgoncalo", "ReviewID": "UR68576313", "Content": "...It's more likely a club / pool party site!

A week before arriving, I sent a request for a booking in Drai's lounge for drinks one evening before going out to dinner which was left unanswered and when we inquired at check in were told that we would have to contact Drai's directly as there was no relationship between them and the W.

The rooftop pool is lovely and I believe accessible during the day but not at all at night when the club is operating. Can you believe that you need special passes during these times just to get into the lobby and up to your room but as before, this doesn't give access to many of the facilities listed on the website.

However, the service at the W Hollywood is among the worst I have ever experienced. Our bed was layered with: flat sheet - dirty duvet with no cover - and another flat sheet on top of that. Nothing else. We called down to see if it could be remade properly, someone came up and dropped a stack of flat sheets at our door and scurried away. Not that we were able to sleep anyway... The noise of the club downstairs echo'ed into our room (bass drum sounds all night) well past 2am on weeknights, and we woke up at 7am to incessant hammering. When we finally called the front desk at 7:30am to complain about the noise, the front desk person audibly snickered. She actually laughed out loud at my complaint. When I asked her why she thought it was funny, she said \"oh, ummm sorry, it's not funny, we can hear it too and it's really loud\" -- OK, then thanks for doing something about the racket. Isn't it your job to attend to these things before people complain? Or to offer any kind of solution? She then put me on hold for 10 minutes listening to music that ensured I wouldn't be able to fall asleep even if the hammering stopped. And then, of course, the hammering never stopped, and the front desk person was unapologetic, and didn't offer earplugs OR COMPASSION. This is the kind of place where earplugs should be dropped in your hand along with the room key when you check in. We slept less than 3 hours that night due to all the noise at night and in the morning. Rude and absurd, uncourteous and unclassy. We ordered breakfast in the room and my $20 waffle had three pathetic strawberries on it and tasted & looked like a stale Eggo. We got a slab of bacon heaped on top of my husband's meal -- Thanks, DUMMIES, we're vegetarians! Final total for inedible crap: $53. Our wake up calls never came through. Our toiletries were never replenished. Our final bill was incorrect. A friend who came to pick us up was told that he wasn't allowed to pull into the stadium-sized driveway to wait TWO MINUTES for us to descend in the elevator, told that he would have to circle the block and call us to have us meet him on the street. We didn't feel we were treated kindly or with respect as guests at any point. This hotel is loud and obnoxious and snobby, and is perfect for guests who are loud and obnoxious and snobby. - - - - - Weird sidenote: don't share a room unless you're totally comfortable seeing your roommate naked.

We pulled up in front of the hotel, gave the car to the valet and were greeted with a chain of velvet ropes and men in black suits who did not say \"Welcome to the W,\" but rather \"Where are you going?\" We told them we were going to Delphines. We were asked if we had a reservation. We said yes. We were asked our names. We told them. We were then passed through the velvet ropes and into reception area. The restaurant was on the other side of the lobby (which is essentially a giant nightclub). To cross the lobby we met Man in Black Suit #2. He asked us where we where going, did we have a reservation, what were our names? Testly we answered again and we were passed through. On the far side of the lobby Man in Black Suit #3 allowed us to pass into the restaurant where the hostess said \"How are you doing?\" To which we replied, \"Not so happy about all the velvet ropes.\" She was nice, seated us and we proceeded to have a lovely meal, fabulous food, reasonably priced, great service and we were wiling to let the bad experience pass because the food was so great. We paid our bill and then proceeded to leave the restaurant where upon we encounter Man in Black Suit #4 who said \"Where are you going?\" By this time we were ready to blow up. We said \"TO OUR CAR\" After spending over a $100 we now have to go through the indignity of three more Men in Black Suits and three more velvet ropes to leave! The manager was called. Two \"managers\" arrived. One listened, the other yelled directly in our faces. We both blew up. So here you have two men in their 50's, well traveled, sober, properly dressed screaming at the top of our lungs in front of reception with this evil \"manager-bouncer\" while peopel are checking in to $300 a night rooms. While we did not stay in a room and we cannot vouch for the rooms themselves, I can assure you we will never set foot in the place again. If you want to experience the indignity of the old Studio 54 in New York where people begged in get in to spend their money, then this is the place for you. A perfectly lovely meal was ruined by hotel staff who have no idea what real security is about. And never once was the phrase \"What can we do to make this right?\" uttered amid the staff shouting.

The pool is definitely a seen and been seen kind of place. There are really nice cabanas to rent which will be the place to be in the summer. The valet staff and front desk staff were very pleasant. Disliked- Ok, where do I begin? The security at the hotel is some of the rudest I have ever experienced. There were 3 guests staying in the room, all registered with the front desk. However, security would not let all 3 of us up to the room. He told us that he would only allow 2 people per room to go up. We went to the front desk and they tried to talk to security but security wouldn't budge! We waited for a manager for about 10 minutes before I asked another friend of ours for his key so that we could get my guest to my room. I understand they are trying to keep non guests out of the hotel but let the guests in! It took 6 hours to bring bags to the room. I was waiting until 3:30 in the morning for the bags, not even sure if the hotel had lost them or not. We just kept getting told the bags were on their way. The Restaurant downstairs was amongst the worst food I had ever had. Almost nothing we ordered was even edible- I will say the Ahi was decent though. Even though I said the lobby bar was fun, the bartenders had HORRIBLE attitudes. A smile goes a long way The rooms are so/so. They are new and decent for the price but I wouldn't say they are up to W standards by any means. The waters on the night stand were $9 each. I don't know how they justify that.

Also the shower was very SEXY! two people can fit comfortably in the shower without being crowded. I don't have an issue but if you have an issue with your shadow showing in a frosted panel in the shower - this is not the hotel for you! The window seat was a neat touch! I was fun to just sit there and read a book and write a few notes. The bed was VERY big & comfortable but was kind of low. There is a dock for your iPod/iPhone so you can blast your own music. The flat panel TV was large enough as well. Cmon where is the free internet!?!? there was a fridge with a few over priced beverages, a few snack items & a large Fiji water = $9. Do yourself a favor and go to Ralph's down the street for a larger supply of those same items for less than half the cost. This hotel was totally awesome but the only downside was the BLARING MUSIC from the club or the \"living room\"? at 3am I do not want to hear the latest remix from the Black Eyed Peas!!!

Nice touch. Positives: 1. Located at Vine and Hollywood, two blocks or so from the main action. 2. People/Staff/Vibe was young and friendly (remembered my name multiple times) 3. The room had many features: Comfy beds, two cordless phones, charging station for Blackberry or iPhone (nice touch), Fast internet (WiFi) 4. Fantastic breakfast restaurant in the style of a French bistro downstairs 5. Amazing lobby 6. Grammy after party was held there 7. Concierge services were awesome 8. Nearby Japanese restaurant was fantastic http://www.sbe.com/katsuya/ Negatives: 1. Compared to other LA Hotels (and even the other W Hotel in Westwood) the rooms were small but well featured. (Obvious Tip: Booking a King size bed room will give you more space as it is just a room (not a suite). 2. The Spa & Pool and Fitness centre were not operating when I was there so I cannot comment on those services. 3. Prices were not cheap (Valet $35 day, Room $300 to $400, Breakfast $65 for two) 4. Bathroom was not really private - smoked glass to shower from room (beware if you like your privacy but this wasn't a problem for us).
