The same ppl own this hotel and price it a lot less. It is clean with very friendly staff and the location couldn't be better. Medici Palace is two doors down. There is an exhibit on Da Vinci on the main floor. The Duomo is at the end of the block. San Lorenzo and all the vendors are a couple blocks away. Michelangelo's David is also two blocks away....what more could you want?!?", "Date": "Jun 8, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR248099863", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187895-d530019-r3837988-Hotel_Sofia-Florence_Tuscany.html", "HotelID": "530019", "Price": "$143"}}
