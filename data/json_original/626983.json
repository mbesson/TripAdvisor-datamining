The location is perfect, right at a centre near Vatican (about 10 minutes walk). We stay at the luxury floor, that is the name of the floor at other building across the street where Vatican Garden inn has another rooms. Room has been clean, new, with free wifi, plasma tv and comfortable beds. Bathroom has been new and clean, there is everyday cleaning by the hotel stuff. Breakfast in hotel is pretty good but there is not many chances to choose between food. There is only cereals, some toasts, coffe and nothing else. Near the hotel is a few good restaurants for lunch and dinner. During the stay there is no problems, we make payment by credit cart with no problems and also the stuff was very kind. So I can definitely recommend this hotel because you get very good value for good money :)", "Date": "August 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGoog hotel nice location bu trude and arrogant manager\u201d", "Author": "Sidihmed A", "ReviewID": "UR113366891", "Content": "The hotel was nice our room was very specious and clean, Bathroom was decent even though had issues like water leaks etc..

The room was charming, in a good location, with a balcony overlooking a small street. The bathrooms, however were quite small and in need of repair. Our shower head shot water all over the bathroom and when we called maintenance to fix it, they simply loosened a bolt in the shower head, fixing the uncontrollable spray, but providing zero water pressure. We also had a problem with the hair dryer falling off of the wall, and unfortunately our room had no back-up hair dryer. Although they advertise Wi-Fi, we were unable to pick up a connection in the room. The only area that I found connection was the check-in/breakfast area, a few blocks away from our room. One evening we came home to an obnoxious alarm going off. When we called the front desk, no one was there, as they had left for the evening, so we were forced to deal with a loud alarm until it shut itself off a few hours later. There was 1 staff member that we saw in the 3 days that we stayed at the Vatican Gardens Inn. I felt quite bad for him as he tried his best to accommodate us, but 1 person isn't capable of tending to new guests, checking out guests that are leaving, preparing breakfast each day, tending to the grounds, and helping people with room problems. Overall, I wouldn't recommend staying at the Vatican Gardens Inn unless you're only planning on staying there to sleep and not shower.", "Date": "November 30, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dubai, United Arab Emirates", "Title": "\u201cGreat place with english speaking staff & awesome breakfast\u201d", "Author": "LeeJon13", "ReviewID": "UR88487363", "Content": "The decor & the rooms are very nice, and the location is very close to the Vatican.

The hotel is well decorated, well located(10 minutes walking to Vatican City) but our room and our bathroom was very small. Breakfast was a joke.

Our stay was okay but there were some major problems with the booking, compounded by the fact that the manager pretended that she was just another member of staff and so unable to help us.

We were content to occupy these rooms ( and pay the extra) but at the managers request moved to two double rooms with the agreement that our booking ( and bill) would be changed to two double rooms. Two nights in we were moved room again (as an arriving guest had requested one of the rooms we occupied). I will only mention the discourtesy of the hotel in moving us from the room in preference of a guest who had not yet arrived. The hotel did not book specific room numbers so this really was very poor customer service. We then spent two nights in a double room beside major buildign work and had a very disturbed rest. At the end of it all we were charged for a double and a triple room even though at the managers request we had only occupied this booking for one night (the rest of the time we were in two double rooms). The woman who dealt with us (whom we later discovered to be the manager) avoided all debate by pretending to be following the orders of another.
