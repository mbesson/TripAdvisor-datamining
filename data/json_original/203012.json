{"Reviews": [{"Content": "I was sooo impressed Sorry I didn't write this earlier. I was at this hotel more than a year ago. I was in Florence for a few days to attend a trade show. One day, I realized my beloved (and very valuable) ring was no longer on my finger. I went balistic and started to walk backward looking at every inch of the floor, inquiring the various people I had met during that day whether they had seen the ring, killing myself trying to remember whose hand I had shaken... It was a nightmare for me and everybody else near me. I had lost, or they stole my ring at the show! Then, phisically and mentally exhausted, I decided I should go to the hotel. Back to my room, MY RING WAS ON THE DESK. The woman who cleans the rooms found it and put it in a little white bowl. Of course, I made sure all the woman's superiors at the hotel knew about this miracle of honesty. Today is thankgiving and I am wearing my ring. I wanted to thank all the honest and hardworking people of the world, including the little woman at Tuscany Hotel in Firenze. I wanted to share this with you, too.", "Date": "Nov 27, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR274269046", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "beatriceughi"}, {"Content": "Lovely holidays Great Hotel       room 2", "Date": "Nov 21, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR841110622", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "ANGELA,GREECE"}, {"Content": "Beautiful Hotel Stayed here for one night on a Globus Tour.

We were NOT disappointed. Yes, the hotel is situated further away from the city center than the other choices, but with the free shuttle service, it was still a convenient location. The only problem with the shuttle service is that it services both the Starhotels Tuscany and the Starhotels Michaelangelo and there is only room for 8 passengers at a time. There is only one shuttle that makes the loop all day long (between the two hotels, the airport and the train station), so there is a good chance that there won't be room on the shuttle for you--- however, booking a reservation for a spot on the shuttle will hopefully eliminate that possibility (which you can do by calling the front desk at any time).Otherwise, the hotel is beautifully decorated, clean and comfortable. The front desk staff is helpful and speaks English. The morning breakfast that is included in the price of the room is fair and comparable to the other breakfast services found at other hotels. We did not eat at the hotel restaurant so I can't comment, but the menu looked great (although a bit pricey). We did however, find a WONDERFUL restaurant just around the corner called Mi Amore which we HIGHLY recommend. Mostly filled with locals, the menu is handwritten and only in Italian and changes daily based on what's fresh/available in the market. Oh, and the supermarket located behind the hotel is quite convenient for bottles of water, fruit, snacks, etc.I personally consider myself a hotel snob and have decently high standards for a hotel, and this hotel has met my expectations. I would absolutely stay here again.", "Date": "Mar 31, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR471307317", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "JNJHERN"}, {"Content": "Good choice in Florence       hotel lobby", "Date": "Dec 8, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR420381630", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "TravelerFromNV"}, {"Content": "Starhotels Tuscany excellent hotel.

It was a 5-minute taxi ride to the airport, 15-minute bus ride to the Duomo area.The hotel was a bit of a challenge to find (we had an Italian driver at the time). Most of the staff was helpful, though some were not at all interested in helping us. Our room was outstanding: clean, quiet and modern. A choice of six different types of pillows (we were tempted to try them all but quickly settled on a favorite). The best room lighting I have ever encountered, bright and handy. A comfortable bed. A wonderful buy for 150 Euro for a night in Florence.The hotel has a free shuttle that runs on a fixed schedule to the airport and to the downtown area seven times a day. Since our schedule didn't match the hotel shuttle schedule, we opted to ride on the city bus instead. The bus (Number 22) stops directly in front of the hotel and takes you into town or back for 1.20 Euro each way; the bus comes approximately every 15 minutes.This hotel would be a great place to crash for a day if you're just arriving from a long overseas flight.

First of, let me say that the hotel is a beautiful modern hotel with very nice, high-end rooms. You will not be disappointed in the rooms. It is not in central Florence, but we picked it for that reason for our last night in Italy because it was closer to the airport and wanted the convenience of not having to drive in to the city to get to the hotel.But...We had trouble finding the hotel. Not the address, we found that, but there was no hotel there. We called several times and they said, yes, that's the correct address, we don't know why you don't see the hotel. Well, what they failed to tell us is that there is a north and south or east and west version of the address. You'd think they would have known this and told us on the phone. So, an hour later we found the hotel.The front desk was very unconcerned that we had trouble getting there and was uninterested to know that there are two addresses of the same number. We thought this info would be of use to them.We had a ton of luggage (for 30 days in Italy) and no one offered to help us with it, We figured there was no bellman since they watched us drag in everything and didn't say a word. Once we got it all in to the lobby, a guy showed up to help. You'd think the desk would have told us to hang on a moment until he was free.Once in the room we discovered that the bed was in the configuration of two individual beds pushed together, but sheeted for two individuals not a couple. This is common in Italy and they simply have to remake the bed for a couple. I asked the woman at the front desk if they could do that for us and the manager overhead us and without even looking at us said to her in Italian, It's already done for two. That was it. We found the housekeepers and they did it for us.The next morning we had a 10:00 am flight out . We had turned in the car the previous night to make the morning less complicated and would just take a cab. We went to the front desk at 7 and asked that they call us a taxi. Without looking up the guy (yet another guy uninterested in helping us with anything) said that it would be difficult because the taxis all went on strike. No concern on his part that we had to get to the airport. I don't even think he looked up. There was an unused shuttle bus outside but no offer to use it for us. I asked them to help us to think of something. I told them I'd pay anyone for a way there, any way. No emotion on their part. Finally, making enough of a fuss, a woman called a friend taxi driver and got him to come and get us. He brought us to the airport and said the strike didn't start until 8 anyway.We went to many hotels in Italy and were always kind to the staff, and even spoke in Italian. We never had a problem anywhere with the people but here. I would not recommend this hotel until they learn about customer service.", "Date": "Jun 8, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR365394968", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "slobizman"}, {"Content": "Fantastic Hotel In Beautiful Florence This hotel is a modern, super clean, stylish gem on the outskirts of Florence, a wonderful free shuttle was convenient for going into town (10 minute ride) Wonderful service, awesome rooms and amenities and all over great deal...
