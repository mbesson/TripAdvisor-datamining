This gave me some concerns but it's actually not that bad. First, the location is OK. It's a bit of a walk to places of interest, but not too bad. For example, on foot it's about 15 minutes to the Rocks, 15 minutes to the Pitt St Mall and about 5-10 minutes to the Darling Harbour area. It's also just down the hill from the Wynyard train station, which is very convenient as that station has links to the airport, central station, the inner west and north Sydney. The immediate vicinity of the hotel is uninspiring though - just the backs of office buildings. If you want anything more interesting (or to find food), you have a 5 minute walk to York St or Erskine St. We stayed in a studio room. This was very spacious and had a small kitchenette and air-conditioning. It was quite well appointed and very comfortable. The furnishings were slightly tired, but better than some places we have stayed for the price. The bathroom was fine, but the complimentary toiletries were not very nice and seemed like they had been left by the previous guest or re-filled. This is one of those places that does a weekly service of your room if you stay that long, so you need to make your own bed, hang up your towel etc. I don't mind doing that, but it's good to know in advance. The freeway (literally) above the hotel didn't bother us. We had very little road noise and what we did have came from Kent St itself, not the freeway. We slept well here. All in all, a perfectly adequate stay, and we would stay there again.", "Date": "April 1, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brussels, Belgium", "Title": "\u201cGreat place, wonderfull staff\u201d", "Author": "KoenVR", "ReviewID": "UR125922999", "Content": "Well after reading some reviews here we were a bit afraid of what to get but we were so surprised of our one bedroom apartment.

Every room has at least one window so we had enough light. The only problem was smell in the dining room because of not efficient and not enough clean kitchen hob. It would be also great if apartment would be served every 3 days and not only once a week (additional room service is available at additional costs). -Second two weeks we got a common studio apartment which had only one room with kitchen, double bed, dining table ad sofa. But it was clean and useful. We faced the same problems as in one bedroom apartments plus studio had only balcony door and no window. So we could only get fresh air through opened balcony door.

Not the most inviting lobby though. We had a room one level up. It was equipped with a full kitchen. We didn't try out anything so can't comment on how updated it was. The bed was comfortable enough. We had a longue chair that was also comfortable (we took a nap on it for a couple of hours after our walk!) and the bathroom was clean.

Most ferries depart from Circular Quay but there are infrequent services to and from Darling Harbour as well. The night we arrived we headed the wrong way looking for somewhere to eat and couldn't find anything open - head for Darling Harbour instead (ie look at a map, don't just head off like we did!) which is really well set up for tourists and where you can eat until late. There are many cafes and pubs and a food hall near the apartments as well. We didn't actually cook in the apartment, just ate breakfast, but it was definitely very well set up for it. There is also a huge list of restaurants that deliver to the apartments. Staff members at reception seemed very helpful and there was lots of information on what to do and where to go in Sydney. (By the way, we recommend the outrageously expensive Bridge Climb, the Zoo and the tour of the Opera House especially). The laundry in the basement is very handy with heaps of machines. Overall, a very good value option in Sydney - we would go back.", "Date": "March 11, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brisbane", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location...but a couple things\u201d", "Author": "Fabs07", "ReviewID": "UR5834309", "Content": "The hotel is in a great location - right in the Sydney CBD and short walks to absolutely everything! However, we were unfortunate enough to hav e road works between 8pm and 5am (yes - overnight)! Because the rooms are right on the road, there was no escape from the concrete drilling and noise of trucks constantly backing up and moving forward. It was terrible, and needless to say, I did not sleep a single minute and was incredible angry and tired the next day. I'm sure this is a one-off occurrence, however, because the hotel is situated in a high density commercial area, bear in mind that construction is allowed to occur overnight. So make sure when you book that there won't be any road works scheduled during your stay! We were only provided with ear plugs, which did absolutely nothing! And we were also not informed that construction was going to occur, which was disappointing. When you first see the hotel, you'll wish you had chosen another one because this is situated right in the midst of two busy roads and underneath an overpass! However, even though Our room was right on the footpath, it was well insulated. However, you did get the occassional motorcycle or truck that would wake you in the middle of the night. The bed was very uncomfortable, and caused us lower back pains during our stay. The room had the stove and all equipment you would need to cook and was very well self-contained. We also had cable with heaps of movies - so that was good too. Staff was friendly, even after a night of mind-breaking concrete drilling. They gave us a bottle of champagne to compensate. Overall, am quite indifferent to this hotel. The roadworks on our first night probably tainted my perception of the place...", "Date": "September 25, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rotherham, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cReally well sound proofed\u201d", "Author": "Chapas77", "ReviewID": "UR5614173", "Content": "Went in April and to say it is under the underpass to the bridge, it is remarkably quiet inside, in fact of all he places I stayed in in Australia It was the quietest.
