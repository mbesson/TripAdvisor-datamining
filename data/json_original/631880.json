So as one can imagine I was very unhappy. However, I used my cell phone called and it was resolved in less then 5 minutes. Then I was provided a very nice room with all the amenities promised as advertised and manager was very friendly and cooperative.

The bad: The manager at the desk chain-smokes outside of the front door which made the lobby reek of smoke when we arrived. There was a stale smoke smell even on our non-smoking floor, something I haven't experienced in a hotel in many years. There is no counter in the bathroom so there is no place to put \"stuff\", which seems silly but is an inconvenience nonetheless. Housecleaning employees were very loud in the morning with music and what sounded like wireless radios. Granted, we were sleeping late, but in a hotel I usually expect that employees would be respectful of guests who came to do exactly that: sleep. The room generally seemed sloppily finished and maintained. Nothing is especially comfortable; it's just a place to stay. The good: Obviously, the price.
