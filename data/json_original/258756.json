The hotel staff was pleasant and helpful - especially the woman who prepared the breakfast buffet and cleaned the rooms - she was a total gem! It is not a fancy hotel at all, but it provided a good night's sleep at a very reasonable rate. It was easy to find and proved to be a good home base for our week in Barcelona. One BIG compalint that I had was that one evening someone was either smoking in the room next to us or in the hall and the odor wafted into our room - GROSS!

The hotel has been fully modernized and is very comfortable and pleasant. The front desk staff are thoughtful and helpful, but this is not a fully staffed large hotel for businessmen. You can easily walk (to the right) down hill several blocks to the calle Gaudi, a pedestrianized street that leads to the Sagrada Familia. The closer you get to the church the more touristy it is. The first part however is populated with Barcelonans. The location is not ideal for visitors not connected to the hospital or other nearby institutions. (The 1900-1930 old hospital is being converted to UN peace and other international entities.)

One of the cleanest hotels I've stayed in, without question. Small hotel, very friendly and helpful staff, smaller and relatively simple rooms--neither cramped nor spartan or bare-bones, just simple in terms of size, furnishings, and amenities (not truly business class, but certainly good enough for a short stay). Room had two twin beds, which we pushed together to make on larger bed for the 3 of us. Not sure if they have other bed options. Simple breakfast layout in the morning. Mini-fridge and safe in the room, no restaurant in the hotel, no room service, no gym or health club. That said, there's so much to see in Barcelona, we didn't miss those things at all. Plenty of cafes and small shops nearby. Right across the road from the sprawling Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau. Plan to take a taxi from the airport, about 25-30 minute ride. Don't know if there's parking available, if you have a car. Approximately 300m from the Guinardo subway station-- which made it truly easy to get around the city. By subway, it's about 15 minutes from La Rambla, the Barri Gotic and the harbor. If you're inclined to walk, it's about a 10 minute walk from the fantastic Sagrada Familia. Great to stroll around the neighborhood, but be prepared for some steep hills, depending on which way you go. One evening, we had to get off the subway early due to some problem on the line, and we had to walk about 20 blocks to the hotel, some parts quite steep - this is fine for adults, not quite so much for younger kids. That said, my daughter didn't complain (much) about the walk. The location won't keep me from recommending this hotel. I would stay here again if the price is right, but if you're looking for something more centrally located, you might not find this the best place to be. Again, friendly staff, clean and simple, overall a good value. Quirky bit of trivia: I read somewhere the building used to be the old Chinese consulate before it was converted to a hotel--this made it a bit cool and creepy at the same time.", "Date": "April 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cheshire,England", "Title": "\u201cA SOUND CHOICE FOR A SHORT STAY\u201d", "Author": "DaveSpencer32", "ReviewID": "UR102758283", "Content": "we have friends in this area of Barcelona and have stayed here before when visiting.

Very comfortable rooms with good A/C. Didn't really hear any ambulances. There aren't many english channels on the TV, but when you are in Barcelona, TV doesn't really matter. Service was very courteous. Didn't try the breakfast so no comment on that. The hotel is located up the hill from the direction of the sea, so the best metro to get off (if you are not taking a taxi) is also the closest- Guinardo/Hospital de Sant Pau, which happens to be the yellow line. The best walk from the hotel is this- turn right when you walk out of the door, heading downhill on Carrer de Cartagena. Take it until you get to the pedestrian boulevard Avinguda de Gaudi (small cars and motorcycles run on the sides). It runs diagonal to the other streets and begins right across the street from the main entrance to the historical part of Hospital de Sant Pau. You will be able to see a great view of the Sagrada Familia from here and the walkway continues all the way to the church. The street is lined with restaurants and cafes and is a very pleasant walk. FYI, a good grocery store is located right across the street from the hospital on Sant Antoni Maria Claret called Bon Preu. You can get tasty crossaints and sandwiches for good prices there to take to the beach!", "Date": "December 3, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wirral", "Title": "\u201cA clean, safe hotel in a good location for a few days in Barcelona.\u201d", "Author": "JMyersWirral", "ReviewID": "UR70383158", "Content": "This is a clean, safe hotel.

It also has air conditioner with temperature controller. Lighting was sufficient. A safe and a fridge were available. High speed internet worked very well, accessible from the room without problem. Downside is no drinking glass or in-room tea/coffee facility. Nevertheless, one night requested spoons to be sent to the room and the staff happily brought it up. The room was nicely furnished like a 3-star hotel expected. Bathroom was big, with a bathtub and a good-size counter and a huge mirror. The water pressure wasn\u2019t very strong but water temperature was constant. Towel wasn\u2019t replaced everyday, which did not bother us. The breakfast consisted of two types of hams, cheese, eggs, cereals, breads, fruits, and yogurt, slightly too expensive for what it is.

I read reviews and sounded mainly ok for the price it did state it had four floors. We landed at Girona caught the Barcelona bus outside straight to centre, then caught taxi to hotel. So when we entered hotel small lobby ,but clean, very helpfull. But I was suprised when we were told to go up in lift to fourth floor and walk the last flight of stairs which was a small flight. At the top of them were two doors right and left ,we had one each. Now I was worried had we been put in two small loft type bedrooms. Wow opened the door big bedroom probably one of the biggest I stayed in beautifully furnished an clean. The bathroom had big corner bath with shower over marble floor again lovely. By then my husband had found balcony doors which went round the side of the hotel and the view was amazing. Our friends had the same so between us there was not much you could not see. Breakfast was basic but enough, the cobs were fresh but it is just a cold buffet. When we left the hotel to go out we did look up at he hotel and could see no more balconies so they could be the only ones.
