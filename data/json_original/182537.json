It's cheep, I'll give it that. However, the front desk staff are totally indifferent and completely useless. The rooms were OK and clean but the whole place is just tired. There is a funky, poorly lit hallway (not accessible - stairs) that leads to the scruffy looking parking garage. Upon checking in, there was a women at the front desk with a complaint and she was exasperated and asking to talk to the manager. (Bad sign number one.) I could hear him on the phone with the front desk clerk in his office, just behind the front desk. He was too chicken sh*t to come out and talk to her. On my last, and very likely LAST, stay I was trying to get down from the 5th floor to check out and both elevators stopped working. After waiting for 15 to 20 minutes I went back to my room and called the front desk. He said that one of the elevators wasn't working but the other one was. I told him that I could tell from listening that neither was working. \"Oh, well I don't know what to tell you.\" Really! That's your best response to a customer who is trapped in your building?! I finally asked if I should just go down the stairs and set off the fire alarms by doing so. He just said \"I guess so...\" Absolutely bloody useless! I shudder to think of how they would handle a true emergency. Anyway, I went to collect my bags and head down five floors of stairs. Just as I collected everything up, the elevator door opened. I hesitated for a second then decided to just go for it. Luckily, everything worked out OK. The lobby looks like a 1980's disco. It's just missing some drag queens and a mirror ball to at least make it camp. As it is, it's just tired like the rest of the place. I am not at all likely to stay there again.

The first room smelt like someone had lit 3 packs of cigarettes, the air conditioner didn't work, and the sheets hadn't been changed just made. The second room hadn't be cleaned and we checked in at 4PM. The third and final disappointing room had cob webs on the wall, mold growing all around the tub and the air conditioner was so loud you could hear it outside the room and looked as if it were from the 1980's. 2) In all three rooms the windows had no screens. So with the air conditioning not working you couldn't open a window either because of the bugs. 3) I'm not handicap but if you are stay away. The only way into the hotel from the parking is up or down stairs that lead to an elevator. 4) The hotel may tell you that there is a restaurant but there's not. In fact there is a bar that becomes a night club around 10 o clock at night. Oh, and there's a liquor store. This brings out very shady and scary people. 5) This hotel is in a horrible part of town. 6) We left early. When checking out we told the lady at the check out counter all the problems we encountered and she argued with us the entire time. She even told me that there were indeed screens on the windows as she snapped at me. And she told me that bugs can not fly to the fifth story.

It's close to the airport, but the location is a bit seedy, with a pool hall adjacent to it. There are what look to be former conference rooms which are now more or less abandoned and filled with old broken furniture and vandalized. The underground parking is locked, so that was good. The \"continental breakfast\" leaves much to be desired, go to Tim Hortons instead. Honestly, for $50 a night, the room itself is fairly servicable, not the cleanest in the world but not the worst I've seen either. It's more the rest of the hotel that gives you the creeps.

With mostly late-afternoon arrivals at the airport, my calls to the hotel result in a pick-up within 30 minutes. At the hotel, I have always found the staff to be attentive (and even after five years, some of the same staff still there). The hotel is not new, and it's not elegant by any means. However, the rooms are clean, and the amenities/level of service are adequate for the price of the room. I do like the fact that guest floor (3-6) access is restricted by room key, especially when there are a lot of non-guests on property (like when there used to be a casino on site--gone since 2005). Although the A/C units are window-mounted, it's not often that the Vancouver climate requires their use. I opened up the windows to enjoy the cool and dry air--a departure from my sticky Florida home. Having taken two trips with someone needing wheelchair accessibility, I found the facilities to be mostly easy to navigate. Reserved parking is scarce though (only three spaces up front, usually taken by those without parking permits), and the bathrooms may be a little small. Ask for an accessible room, but call **well in advance**--they only have 2 or 3 accessible rooms. There is secured parking, but one is advised to be careful with belongings in the car. Vancouver is a relatively safe city compared to other cities of the same size. But property crime is an epidemic, including auto theft/break-ins. It's not just this hotel--it's one of the few flaws that I've discovered citywide in my many trips there. If you don't need to rent a car, don't. This hotel sits immediately along two bus routes (100 is east/west with connections to YVR, 8 for more frequent north/south, and up to the downtown core). The system is efficient, reasonably clean and safe, and far-reaching. Save money on the rental car and spend $8 CDN on a day pass. hint...the Esso station across the street sells the passes, but it seems to be a well-kept secret. I choose to stay there year-after-year for the value and the staff. Although I could spend more on a hotel and get a more upscale decor, I stay here, spend less, and have extra spending money for the rest of my vacation. My main purpose of a hotel is to have a place to sleep and keep my stuff, and so a wealth of amenities is not important to me. As for food, it is limited on site, unless you like to laugh at (bad) multi-lingual karaoke. There's a White Spot about a 10-minute walk east (under a minute by car). Open late, and good quality food.
