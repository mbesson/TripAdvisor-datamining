The hotel is ideally situated for exploring old Dubai, a short walk from the soukhs and the Creek. The nearby Dubai museum is well worth a visit, not in any way \"stodgy\". We resisted the temptation to use the in-house restaurants and discovered \"Mama's\",which was a 5 minute walk away. The food was South and North Indian, with Chinese thrown in for good measure. We ate there every night, fantastic value,quality food and first rate service. I did use the Irish Bar \"Waxy's\", but not often, thirteen or so lagers,Kilkenny Bitter,Guinness and Strongbow were on draught but at 32 dirhams a pint (\u00a36 ish) a bit on the prohibitive side. Go on Wednesday night and roll the dice with the bar tender for a free pint! I did and won 2 pints! Now for the negatives. We had stayed in 10 hotels in the days leading up to our stay at the Royal Ascot, all of them provided free WiFi, tea/coffee making facilities in the bedroom and HOT water in the shower. The Royal Ascot failed on all three counts. I suppose the WiFi and the tea/coffee you can manage without but TEPID showers cannot be excused.

SOOO, ask for a room as far as possible from this restaurant!!), an Indian, a Japanese, A Thai/Chinese, a Steak Place (very good with a very good deal for steak and wine for lunch) etc - I could say that out of the dinner we had at the Burj Al Arab hotel, the food served at Royal Ascot was the best we had in Dubai, especially in the Russian Restaurant... After trying a lot of places, we decided to dine at the hotel! Taxis in Dubai are not expensive and they are metered. So, it is very easy to go everywhere in town from our hotel. Subway is not complicated either. The hotel also offers a free daily shuttle to Jumeirah beach, which the Burj Al Arab and beaches are located. The breakfast is OK, nothing really exceptional about it. You have to pay to use the internet (no matter if in your room or in business center), and I wouldnt say it is cheap, but, not that expensive either. They dont REALLY have non-smoking rooms. For sure people smoked (and a lot) in both rooms they assigned to us at the hotel. We changed the first one because the Lebanese show and also, because of the heavy smell of tobacco.

We asked for a quiet room (other reviewers had complained it could be noisy) but we didn't get one. It was however not the fault of the hotel. It was our misfortune to pick a time when road works were being carried out, right outside the hotel. The time they choose to do such repairs was when the road are at their quietest, which is in the early hours. A quieter room would have been at the rear of the hotel away from the main road. Oh well. When we arrived, we left our luggage in the hands of a bell boy and checked in. After this we were shown to our room which was right opposite the lifts. The expected noise normally associated with such locations never materialised, but our luggage did, in good time. Not only was it all there but there was an additional plastic bag mostly full of cans of Fosters lager. \"That's not ours\", I said. \"I don't remember whose it is\", he said. After some scratching of heads, he asked if he could leave it in our room while he tried to find the owner. About fifteen minutes later he returned saying he had no idea who they belonged to and then offered them to us, three times. \"They're not ours\", I said each time, suggesting he look for a recently arrived Australian. Was all this genuine or was he trying to pull of some sort of scam, I know not, maybe you do? Our room was a good size and everything we expected, clean, big television, comfortable beds, decent bathroom etc. Our first night there coincided with our wedding anniversary, so being on there on a B&B basis and not wanting to search for somewwhere to eat, we decided at the Korean restaurant on the ground floor after an excellent pint in the bar. The actual ordering took a long time and the staff weren't really interested in dealing with us, there were after all, several groups of (I assume) Koreans already eating there. Now I don't mind a little bit of spiciness in my food but my wife doesn't, so we told them this. The starters were great and the BBQ OK, but the casserole had a chilli floating in it. I fished this out and tasted it. \"Not too bad \" I told my wife, however she thought it was hot and so I looked for more chillis. I found another seven(7). After two mouthfuls she had had enough and even I struggled to make a dent in the generous portion. What a waste of otherwise good food. Unless you like really spicy hot food, I don't recommend eating here. On the last day we took advantage of the 110 AED deal of steak and half a bottle of wine in the Wellington bar. I had the rack of lamb and my wife the steak. Both were really good although we weren't asked what type of potates we wanted (got chips). About a third of the way through I had to go to the bar and ask for the wine. \"Oh you want it now\" is what I got, Well \"yes please\". The swimming pool is on the roof and very pleasant with a great view. On our final day, our ride to the airport was going to leave before breakfast. \"Not a problem\", we were assured at reception. They took our wake up time and breakfast order the evening before. The wake up call was ten minutes early and the breakfast hadn't arrived as we left the room, half an hour after the time it was ordered for. \"Oh\", is all we got at reception when we checked out.

Some staff were very nice and friendly with the kids, others just looked like they were smiling through gritted teeth and were on a power trip. We had an issue with the breakfast manager who took objection to us taking 2 bread rolls for the kids who did not eat at the table, and was told there are international rules to follow, and if everyone did it then there would be no breakfast left for others! Must be different in dubai than the rest of the world where kids are treated like kids and given exception and breakfast even sent to rooms after. On checking out was asked if had used anything from mini-bar told them no, they still sent someone to the room who entered whilst my wife was getting changed.

Lovely restaurants in the area if you can find them, particularly a Punjabi restaurant about 5 mins away at most, low prices and better food than the restaurant in the hotel.

There were some tissues in the dustbin that had not been cleared away. The room had a kitchenette area with a fridge-freezer but no tea/coffee facilities and no complimentary bottled water.

The bathroom was small and the toilet was difficult to get to as it was behind the bathroom door. There was no separate shower and there were no toiletries to speak of provided in the bathroom. I was told that I would get a complimentary newspaper but none was provided even though I saw them outside other guest rooms. Breakfast was good, with a selection of meals available. Service was reasonable but no pleasantries or smiles evident from the staff working there. My room was meant to be charged directly to my company but the hotel claimed they had no paperwork. Several calls later, they finally accepted that the bill would be charged to the company but at check-out, I was again told that I would need to pay for my room - this was eventually resolved but left me feeling quite annoyed.

The best part about the hotel as per me would be its location. It is situated on Khalid Bin Walid Street, one of the prime roads of Bur Dubai. But what matters more is that it is just opposite many discount shops (Seventh Heaven, Green, Carrefour) and also Indian restaurants (Vasantam, Udipi hotels, Thalssery, etc). This is a big advantage if you are looking out to buy a lot of souvenirs and bulk shopping for essentials. It is opposite the local computer and technological-related item shops like Sharif , etc for the latest updates on the electronic market (mobiles, cameras). The Burjuman Mall, Karama, is close by for the brand conscious and the Gold Souk Deira is also near for all the dazzle shopping. The breakfast spread was adequate with English, continental, Indian and Arabic food to choose from. The breakfast tables were always full implying that the hotel was well occupied during our visit. But then the Dubai Shopping Festival was on during that period so I guess that explains the high occupancy rate. The housekeeping, restaurant and the reception staff were coordial and prompt in their responses. There are also lots of World cuisine restaurants in the hotel like Korean, Russian, Indian, Arabic, etc. They also have a beauty parlor and Spa Massage facility. Internet is chargeable which was not cool. The pool was on the rooftop but we couldn't enjoy it though. They also have a night club which appeared to be crowded whenever we returned late in the night. It is a very nice hotel but didn't spend much time in the hotel to enjoy its facilities much. We did avail of the complimentary drop at the airport though.

I had to manually crank up the aircon in the middle of the night. The breakfast was unremarkable and par for a hotel of this class.

This hotel needs modifications and organization. so far 3 star is enough for ROYAL ascot hotel!!", "Date": "January 20, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dubai, United Arab Emirates", "Title": "\u201cDon't eat at Troika restaurant\u201d", "Author": "SuperMissG", "ReviewID": "UR23593182", "Content": "We went there to celebrate a friend's birthday .

Pros: rooms are quite large and adequately air-conditioned, large bathroom with good water pressure, friendly and knowledgeable concierge. Convenient location to the Dubai Museum area and in driving range of some of the major malls. Smoking rooms (I was unfortunately appointed one and could not be relocated to a non smoking room) are not too smelly and I as a non smoker was not really bothered by it. Turn down service with a complimentary fruit platter (bananas, apples, grapes and oranges). Cons: noise from the next door night club can be heard, even on the 6th floor and won't stop until around 3AM. Check in/ Checkout agents are very inefficient; it took us about 40 minutes to check out (there was no queue; this was the actual time it took to get checked out). There were items on the bill that could not be explained by the check out agent (we did not use the mini bar, but the hotel insisted that it was a charge for the mini bar). In total the bill was printed out about 5 or 6 times, each time mistakes were made and the bill needed to be reprinted. In the end we missed our flight check in deadline with about 5 minutes and we mainly blame this on the long check out process. When we had to find a hotel to stay in until our next flight, we did not think twice and checked in to the Hilton Dubai Jumeirah: what a difference it was! So save yourself the potential troubles ahead and avoid this hotel which has the potential to be a decent hotel, but at this stage is certainly no more than an average 3 star hotel with inadequate staff (except for the concierge staff).", "Date": "December 6, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bologna, Italy", "Title": "\u201cgood hotel in good location\u201d", "Author": "ritafant", "ReviewID": "UR22040424", "Content": "We had three days in February 2008 (and 4 days last year, same month).

Normally we travel at least once a month, this is our monthly business trip; we choose the Royal Ascot as a result of the website, and the fact that this was a hotel that claimed to be a 5 star. IT IS NOT BY ANY MEANS!! The service is very frustrating to say the least, each morning we've ordered breakfast in our room, and each order has been wrong or missing half of the items. Sorry just doesn't seem to cut it when you're expecting 5 star service/quality. The bathrooms in the main reception were completely trashed the other day, as a result of a huge party of tourists that had to use these to \"shower\" before leaving to fly home. When I complained about having to walk through a puddle to use the bathrooms, and lift my trousers to avoid stepping in what might be urine and water mixed together was horrifying, again, this IS NOT A 5 STAR HOTEL! Room service takes over an hour for breakfast, we requested our laundry this morning at 9:00 from the previous day, it's now 12:15 and still no sign of our clothes. Next time we'll be staying at the Palace, as the service there is as close to a 5 star as possible. We'd rate this hotel as a 3 star at most. The staff at the front desk are extremelly rude, in any other 5 star hotel they bend over backwards to make sure you're comfortable. We ordered a ironing board and iron for our room, and the ironing board they sent up had black marks all over it, we were told to take a sheet off the bed and cover the board with this!! Does this sound like a 5 star to you??? Ha, hardly! Save your money and stress levels and book someplace else! P.S. No CD players, no DVD players, the radio on the TV's does not work, and every morning we wake up to the smell of garlic meat cooking. I truly can't wait to check out of this sham of a hotel.

The service was very slow and we found the Staff not very friendly as everyone seemed busy. Our rooms weren't cleaned to the standard of a 5 star hotel we had to keep calling room service for them to finish the job correctly. The biggest let down was the breakfast room. It was situated right next to the reception area which we found it bizarre with people walking in and out of the main entrance. The staff were not friendly to greet us in the morning and it was constantly busy. Staff had no idea where to find a table for us it was ridiculous.
