It's great for viewing the sunset as well. The gym in the hotel is very small and only comprises of a few pieces of equipment. If gym is your thing during your time away from home, this hotel probably isn't for you. I can't comment on the hotel restaurants as I was too busy exploring all the great food the city has to offer. I stayed in room 1039 which is a lovely extra large room with a king bed but there was a small issue with it. There is a strange smell in the room (you get used to it very quickly and only notice it the first minute or two when you enter) that the staff didn't manage to get rid of.

NH Calderon has a nice pool area where you can enjoy the view of the city and work on your tan.

It's a buffet which I sometimes find not very charming.

The stay was pleasant for my colleagues and me, and I wouldn't hesitate to look into this hotel on business or pleasure, as the location is great and the surroundings are excellent. As usual with my reviews, the Good, Bad, and Ugly. The Good - Room. It was a corner room next to the elevator bay - which I typically don't like because of the added noise. However, the room included a second interior door that kept out all outside noise (if there was any). In addition, the room was of good size and had some nice amenities: large closet, safe, combo tub/shower, working desk, hardwood floors, etc. (See note below under \"Bad\" concerning bed). - Cleanliness. Hats off to the cleaning staff. My room was spotless. - The windows must have been double paned because even though I was on the second floor, I could not hear much traffic. Yes, the occasion horn honking but nothing horrible. - Location. Close to underground (2 blocks) and relatively in the heart of the city. One night we ate at the waterfront and walked back to the hotel. It took about 30 minutes, but the walk was nice and we got to see a bit of the city. - A tip. Next door to the hotel (go left as exiting the property) on the corner is an absolutely excellent tapas bar. Do yourself a favor and either grab a table or sit at the bar. The barstaff and food was outstanding. What made it even better is that clearly the restaurant appeared to be more of a local haunt that a touristy spot. - Doorman. Helped me with my bags and offered to grab me a taxi, recommend spots, etc. Nice job. The Bad - The beds. Two major issues. First, the bed moved. I believe it was on wheels and would roll just a bit. Kinda of odd. Second, the bed was too soft and almost uncomfortable. I slept OK, but the bed was not up to par from what I would expect from a NH property. - Staff at check-in/check-out. Maybe it's the local culture, but neither was I greeted properly or thanked when I left the property. I understand it's a hectic week most likely, but at least look me in the eye instead of chatting with your co-workers (I was the only customer present at check out.) The Ugly - Charging a high amount (24 Euroish for 24 hours) for spotty wireless broadband access. Pathetic. I don't mind paying - but at least give your guests high speed access. Don't like this review - don't outsource your wifi service. With the mix of a nice room (questionable bed) and location, I would look into the property again.

The reception desk, although a little bit formal, were very helpful: we arrived very early, but were able to check in straight away; and we had a late flight so they allowed us to keep the room a little bit later, and then stored our luggage for us between checking out and getting a taxi to the airport. The breakfast was extensive and very nicely presented. The waiting staff are unobtrusive but very quick to assist when needed, and they are always busy tidying and cleaning tables and making sure the food is neatly arranged and presented correctly. We were very impressed! The rooftop pool's a bit small and there aren't many loungers, but it's o/k; and lets face it, who spends much time there anyway? We spent maybe an hour up there: you get some good views! The location is in my view excellent.

They took note of my credit card details and let us go to the rooms. The rooms are really small, however comfortable for such a short stay. They have LCD TV, comfy beds, bath tub with a good pressure, shampoo, shower gel and hair dryer. However make sure you close your room door properly, because it does not close automatically as it does in most hotels' rooms. The room is relatively good soundproofed, hardly heard any street noise however could heard flushing noise and banging doors from next rooms. Wifi Internet is 9\u20ac a day. They also provide parking at 24\u20ac per day, which is a good rate because all the parking spots in the city cost the same: 2,65\u20ac/hour. However having a car in Barcelona is definately not needed as it is a nightmare to find places to park! Also the hotel has a fantastic terrace on 11th floor with a good size swimming pool and a few loungers. Pool towers are provided for free. Make sure you go there for amazing city views! My rate was supposed to include breakfast, however when we got to the breakfast room we were told that our rate only included 1 breakfast per room, and that we would need to pay extra 20\u20ac per person?!? I think the way this case was handled was not acceptable because a simple call to the reception would have solved the problem, however we had to go downstairs to solve the problem ourselves! They called the breakfast room and it took 15 minutes from the moment we got out of our rooms to be seated at the breakfast room!

More importantly the best tapas restaurant in town (Ciudad Condal) or possibly of the country even is just a few steps away on the other corner of the block. Needless to say we have never tried the hotel's restaurant (Ciudad Condal is excellent for breakfasts too! And for lunch, and for dinner, and for in between snackies,...). The swimming pool on top of the building, although small, is a very welcome point of rest after strolling through the city on a warm day and has a superb view of the city. They could do with more sunbeds though, there never seems to be enough. There used to be a small indoor swimming pool as well on the ground floor but unfortunately it's no longer in use. The rooms (both standard and superior) are fabulous: very clean and modern. The room has a flat screen tv with several foreign channels (German, French, BBC) in addition to the standard Spanish channels. The bathroom is well appointed and clean. It used to be stocked with plenty of toiletries including razor and comb. For some reason this has been stopped and so we had to go out and buy a comb and razor during our last stay... The minibar is expensive (but not outrageously), the safety box is free. The only negative point I can think of is the airconditioning. During our last stay (early March) the inside temperature in the room was higher than the outside temperature and we couldn't get the airconditioning to work on full (winter setting). Sleeping with the window open is not an option because of the noise (especially on a Saturday night). Not all staff are fluent in English but they do try. Greeting them in Spanish usually breaks the ice! They will also keep your luggage safely stored on the day of your flight home so you don't have to lug it around before your return to the airport. Don't be put off by the security men in the lobby either: they are very much on the ball and actually make you feel safe. Another nice touch is the computers you can use in the lobby. On request you are given a free voucher (one per day) which will give you EUR 5 worth of internet use / page printing. Enough to do the OLCI for your flight home and check your email.

If not for a swim, at least for the spectacular views. Also the room had nice extra touches, such as nh-smints and extra bathroom amenities such as comb and shoe polish. Only thing unfortunate is that the hotel, for some legal reasons, is unable to deliver an iron + board to the room. I therefore had a very crumpled shirt to wear. On the other hand, there are plenty of shopping opps just outside the door, that one can always buy a shirt on the spot. My rate did not include breakfast, which was just fine. When you walk out the main entrance and take a left, there is a lovely cafe/bar about 10 metres down where you can have an excellent service of coffee, pastries and juice.

WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT. My partner has been staying at this hotel for close to 10 years and always selects this property for our visits to Barcelona. Four years ago, I joined him and fell in love with Barcelona and this property. The area is awesome and it's location near the Ramblas is fantastic. I am sad to say that this hotel is not worthy of my affection & we were both MAJORLY disappointed & disgusted by the staff, the rooms and the general property. In summary, point by point. 1) pool is crap with no more than 8 or 10 pool beds 2) spa is closed on weekend - despite the hotel being 100% full 3) room was small and filthy 4) staff were rude with unprofessional telephone manners, incapable of eloquently responding to issues 5) not possible to internet in the room - missing necessary cables to connect laptop and when we called down to ask we reached some kind of caveman who was never taught how to communicate on a phone let alone to guests. Shocking to speak to someone who communicates like an ape PLUS did not have any knowledge of computers. 6) rooms are small, using every space - when I was working on my laptop (without internet - needed to check emails from work but could not) and could not open the desk drawer which was unable to be opened completely cuz of the space. 7) We asked for a quiet room and were given a room directly in front of the elevator- front desk not very smart about floor/room layout. 8) Changed rooms and was then given a room without a bathtub - how DARE they charge 155 EUR for a room without a bathtub. Front desk said they were unaware that that room did not have a bathtub (only a shower). 9) Third room has 2 tiny beds together which resembles hospital beds with giant wheels that moved and rolled around anytime you moved - UNBELIEVABLE! 10) On our last night, the wheel of one bed broke off and the bed would tip over if I moved. Could not fix it because it had a broken screw. Did not bother to call maintenance since it was 2AM and doubtful that the hotel actually employed staff to help with these issues since most of the general services were lacking staff. I have digital photos to show proof of the shabby bed conditions. 11) carpets in the halls outside our rooms (and on the 3 floors I visited) were all filthy and not vacuumed during our entire stay. They had completed a renovation phase (with unfinished walls in front of elevators and buttons not functioning etc. etc) and seemed to lack any sense of style to complete the job. 12) We noticed that the room also did not display any fire escape route behind the doors which is quite illegal but not a concern for this property. I also have pictures of this and will forward to the authorities. 13) On the day before our flight, we wanted to check in online for our flight the following day but, as mentioned earlier, we were unable to get internet access in our room so we tried the mini-business centre off the lobby - WHICH ALSO DID NOT HAVE ANY STAFF. There was another guest using a computer for over 30 minutes so we used another computer since there was nobody around to guide us. Five minutes into our task, some front office staff member came shouting into the room HEY HEY HEY .... to get our attention, rather than politely addressing us as guests should be. He proceeded to shout us and tell us that we should NOT be using this computer. So I responded by advising him that there is not staff or signs anywhere informing us - plus the computer was turned on so how were we to know. He continued to be angry so I asked for the manager IMMEDIATELY. But he disappeared and the manger never came so we walked away after 20 minutes of waiting and found ourselves thoroughly disgusted by this point. These were just a few of our experiences, we have many more along with some lovely digital photos to document the poor state of this hotel. WE DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS HOTEL TO ANYONE and I will be sure to share my message with everyone I meet and on every travel forum I can find.

This hotel is belonging to the NH hotelgroup. The founder of this hotelgroup later on sold his chair and opened the AC Hoteles, with even more eye for detail and guests'needs. The building is from the seventies and was completely refurbished. The NH Gran Hotel Calderon has a private arts collection, which you can see in the corridors and the lobby. The hotel is a good 4* hotel wih all modern ammenities, although some rooms are rather small. Rooms all have private bathroom with great bath products, make-up mirror, hairdryer. Rooms have private safe (electronic), minibar, interactive tv with games and pay tv. Bar: nice, but not a lot of people make use of it, so it's more a quite area to read a book in stead of a cosey bar. Breakfast buffet is just great, with great variety (dietic and normal food, fresh fruit juices, etc...). Eggs: they cook them as you wish. Normally they have apart from the outdour rooftop pool an indoor swiming pool (ground flour - with sauna and gym) but last time I went there they were refurbushing and constructing a SPA on the rooftop near the outdoor pool. Guests, however, were given an alternative: free entrance to a nearby gym. Location is superb: near the Ramblas (the hotel is situated on a shopping street - Rambla de Catalunya - which is the prolongation of Las Ramblas), near major shopping areas: El Corte Ingl\u00e9s, Portal del Angel and Passeig de Graci\u00e0 (more luxurious shooping) are just arround the corner. Eating out: on the corner a great tapabar, worldfamous in Barcelona: Ciudad Condal!!!! Opposite a decent restaurant: La Tramoia. In the neighbourhoud: Citrus / Jean Luc Figueras - 2 Michelin stars/ Tragaluz, El japon\u00e9s... The location is also superb for sightseeing: just around the corner: las ramblas, gaudi-monuments such as La Pedrera and Casa Battl\u00f3, Plaza de Cataluyna where you can take the BUS TURISTIC (hop on, hop off)... Public transport: metro and train and busses: Plaza de Catalunya (less than 100m). Also on the plaza de Catalunya you can take the AEROBUS to the airport for 3.50 euros. Great value, because has very few stops (max 3) and is specially designed for passangers with luggage. This hotel can be recommended both for business as for leisure! Enjoy your stay!
