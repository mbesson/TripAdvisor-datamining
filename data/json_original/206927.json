The location was outstanding, near the top of the La Rambla...we walked from the hotel to the Sagrada Familia, Torre Agbar and to Port Vell. Pretty much all of the sites are within walking distance of the hotel. The staff was friendly enough, but there was, at times, a breakdown in the language barrier; their English not being all that great and my Spanish not existing at all. Despite this small problem they were very helpful and answered our questions to the best of their ability. I only found a few things disappointing regarding the hotel and that was: the size of the lobby compared to the picture on the internet, no handicap ramps for our stroller and the lack of a bar even though there was a sign saying that the bar was on the first floor. I posted a picture of what I think they may consider a bar (vending machine with beer in it). ;-) Regardless of these small flaws we loved the Barcelona, will recommend it to friends and will definitely stay there again.", "Date": "September 22, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Milwaukee, Wisconsin", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location, Simple and Friendly Hotel\u201d", "Author": "OphirBY", "ReviewID": "UR8255389", "Content": "The hotel is a simple 4 star (actually 3 stars in my opinion) located smack in the middle of the Plaza Catalunya, Barcelona's tourism center. 5 Minutes walking from Las Ramblas, 10 minutes from the Barri Gotic (old city), 20 minutes from the Segrada Familia Cathedral.

It was really nice that the hotel offered breakfast each morning from 7am-11am free of charge. Great location to all shops and La Ramblas (great tourist walk). The bad part was the room. It looked much better in the pictures on the website. You could hear the people on the balcony clear as a bell in your room. The doors are pretty thin as well. Oh and don't let me forget the bed bugs. From the first day to the last they got worse. My arms were eaten alive. I really didn't know what was bitting me at first because it was one or two bumps. By the end of the week my entire forearm was a mess. Upon checkout I told the front desk person and guess what.. for the first time it seemed they didn't understand english.

The biggest problem was the bathroom which smelled damp and mouldy - it was an extremely strong smell, which really had an effect on the atmosphere of the room. In the end we decided to change hotels. The lift didn't always work but I'm not complaining since walking the staris is good excersice :) The breakfast was nice, you'll be ready to tackle the sights after it. The service at the front desk was friendly and we were always greeted with a smile. Husa Barcelona is located right in the city center on a quiet side street. It's a walking distance from almost all the interesting sights and there's a metro station close by. Check out the small bar right opposite the hotel if you want to stay away from the really touristy bars :) No English was spoken there but don't worry, you'll get your point across! Barcelona is such a wonderful city with so much to see that you won't be spending much time in the hotel, so locationwise I'd say go for the Husa but if it's atmosphere you're after - forget it!", "Date": "May 18, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Stansted, UK", "Title": "\u201cGood location\u201d", "Author": "Sue60", "ReviewID": "UR7245428", "Content": "We liked this hotel,(24-28 March 2007). It's so well located near the top of La Rambla, we walked to the cathedral, Casa Battlo, Casa Milia, the sea, Palau de la Musica. The staff were pleasant & helpful & spoke English as I'm ashamed to say we only had a few words of Spanish/Catalan between us. We were on the 7th floor & our rooms had outdoor terraces with chairs & tables. Our friends in 707 & 710 had a good view over Placa de Catalunya but we had asked for a quiet room so were put further along the street, away from the busy square. The double glazing was good so the rooms were quiet . They were comfortable & clean with a pleasant breakfast room.There was a buffet of fresh & tinned fruit (this could have been a bit more imaginative),4 types of cereal, yoghurt,cold meats, cheeses, breads, hard boiled eggs, scrambled egg, bacon & sausage, various delicious looking croissants & pastries.So plenty of choice. We'd have used the terrace more if the weather had been warmer,as there's a great market about 10-15 minute walk away off la Rambla so you could buy lovely fruit etc. If your room doesn't have its own there is another terrace with tables & chairs on the 7th floor. It was a good base & we got the 4th night free, booking with Expedia. We'd certainly consider this one again if we go back & there's lots to do & see that we didn't have time for. Do look after your money & cards in Barcelona. Our friend who travelled separately from us had her purse taken from the bottom of her zipped-up bag that was over her shoulder, at the bus station as soon as she arrived. At the police station she met someone else who had her bag taken when she put it down to get her case out of the bus, & at the hotel was someone else who had something taken while she was out. My neighbour had her bag snatched from off her shoulder last year. It's worth having a bag or camera on a long strap that can go across your body & you can hold it on the front, with the opening on the inside.I had small amounts of money in different zip pockets in my bag & in a body belt, & didn't take a purse. The hotel room had a safe, 10 euro returnable deposit for the key.

The size of the rooms were spacious enough, the decor was a bit let down. The bathroom and W.C was separate. The hotel maids were very good, cleaned rooms everyday, clean towels available everyday and also changed our bedding in the duration of our stay. The location was excellent as it was very accessible to the centre of catylan square and fanstatic shops located near by. Plenty of restaurants within walking distance. We had arrived by taxi as we weren;t sure of location, but travelling back we took the Airport bus which is literally few minutes walking distance from the hotel and it only cost 3.75 euro's per person. This was our second visit to the beautiful city and I can say the location was perfect. We had breakfast booked separately which we stayed for one morning. Many choices available. The beds were comfortable but we found it was it abit noisy with traffic late at night and early in the morining which woke us up. There was a mini-bar available but no coffee facilities in the room. Not to worry as there plenty of coffee houses located near by, and one across the road. There is also a theatre across the road, we were lucky we had a room with trees giving us privacy from the bright lights.

We paid \u00a3516 for a twin room for five nights - it was recommended by a travel agent - a proper travel agent not just one who hands out brochures. We were a bit surprised at the minute size of the reception area having looked on the web site it looked quite spacious. One of the young men behind the desk took our cases - perhaps because we were two ladies on our own - put them in the lift and we set off to our room. The lighting system is rather eccenric, every time we turned something on we turned something off, but it just amused us. The bathroom was small with over the bath shower and vanity unit with a big mirror and excellent lighting - handy for make up etc and a hair dryer. A plus point was the separate loo and bidet across from the bathroom, very rare for a hotel of this size. It was just a minute from Placa Catalunya with buses and Metro close by plus El Corte Ingles department store which to us spoiled Londoners didn't have any of the style we are used to. We asked the receptionist on the first night to recommend a restaurant fairly close by and he suggested one about 20 years away which was excellent Catalan food. He didn't give us a card or tell us to say Jose sent us so that he would get a kickback. The breakfast was very good with plenty of choice of breads, cakes, cereals, jam, honey, ham, cheese even olives! Tea was a bit weak but we had taken the precaution of bringing a few English tea bags with us. There was bacon and scrambled egg for those who have to have the hot breakfast. On the morning of our departure we struggled down to the mezzanine level with our suitcases - one of the guys came out from behind the desk and said we should have left them in the room and they would have fetched them later. he luggage room was full, we went back after lunch to get our bags, they ordered a taxi for us and took our bags out to the taxi. We did wonder on our first evening where the bar might be, but as there was a very nice little bar bang across the street, it didn;t really seem to be a problem. They have conference facilities there - maybe the bar is opened then. We seemed to have had a totally different experience from others with the staff, but the Spanish are a sort of insular race they are not like th Italians who always want to make a fuss of you. Another point unless you are paying top dollar you are always going to find city hotels in Europe small - I have stayed in dozens of hotels all around Europe and for value for money and pleasant service - I would rate the Husa Barcelona quite highly Perhaps some times if you approach the staff in a courteous way they will be more courteous and helpful to you.
