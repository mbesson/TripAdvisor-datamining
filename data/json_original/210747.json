However, a double en-suite room was on offer for \u00a355. Not having heard from them, I decided to walk down to the hotel (10 minutes from work) and enquire about a room directly. The young man on reception was polite and helpful but explained that they had only room available, a single without facilities. In fairness to him he let me see it before I paid. The room was at the very top of the hotel, was tiny and the nearest toilet/shower facilities were on the floor below. It was clean though and adequate for my needs but the price was still \u00a355! Sadly, what he failed to tell me was that all the water tanks for the hotel were located in the ceiling void above the room. Consequently, every time someone took a shower, flushed a toilet, washed their hands, filled a kettle, my room was invaded by the sounds of water gurgling, tanks filling, etc. It didn't make for good night's sleep and at 4:30 I gave up and left the hotel before 6, foregoing breakfast and deciding to take a shower at work. As I left, the same young man was on reception and even though I got a terse 'good morning' from him, he didn't look up and meet my eye. I also noticed that the vacancies sign was still showing from the previous evening so I suspect he MAY have been a little economical with the truth about my room being the only one available. All in all, I suspect that had I been given a different room and managed a good night's sleep, I would be leaving rather different feedback. It is probably, a fairly decent budget hotel.", "Date": "March 8, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cFantastic location!\u201d", "Author": "DanielVinkelman", "ReviewID": "UR123719318", "Content": "Stayed for three nights back in September.

I didn't go for the usual 'show and hotel' package, instead booked everything separately as I had limited funds. I booked the Dover Hotel in Belgrave Road, Victoria after reading reviews on TA. I had already booked 2 cheap flights with Ryanair (\u00c2\u00a328 rtn) so we were good to go. We stayed for 3 days - Monday to Wednesday (29 June - 1st July) and crammed a lot in! The hotel was as described in TA - basic but clean and that's all I wanted really. We spent very little time in it as we were out all day sightseeing as my daughter had never been before. The owners were very friendly and helped us with directions. At breakfast the women serving were also very nice. Breakfast was - again - basic but what you would have at home, fruit juice, cereals, tea/coffee and toast. Near the hotel was Victoria Shopping Mall which has a food court on the upper floor so if we were hungry there was plenty of choice nearby. On the Monday after checking in to the hotel, we decided to have a look around. We went to a couple of ticket booths to price tickets for 'Wicked' and ended up getting two for the stalls for the Tuesday evening performance at the brilliant price of \u00c2\u00a332.50 each - 4 rows from the front! We then just wandered round the capital - from Buckingham Palace, through Green Park and up to Fortnum and Mason's and Piccadilly Circus. We had our dinner at TGi Fridays where they sang Happy Birthday to my daughter and presented her with a huge slice of hot chocolate fudge cake with a candle in it - she looked embarrassed but I think she really enjoyed it! On the Tuesday we decided we would go for a bus tour with the Big Bus Company - well worth it for anyone who really wants to see the capital - but opt for the blue tour with the headphones as it goes out round Kensington, whereas the red tour doesn't appear to do that (according to the map). As you can hop on and off, we were able to spend more time at particular places - e.g Trafalgar Square, etc. Tuesday night was spent in the Apollo Theatre - the show was amazing! On Wednesday, we went to Covent Garden where there was a real mix of performers. Bearing in mind that this was one of the hottest days so far this year they all were brilliant and their shows were definitely worth seeing! All in all we had a great time shopping and sightseeing.

Now we aren't picky, but when paying over $500 for four nights, you expect your own toilet. I go back down and the guy says of course their is no refund, but we have the privledge of a room on the ground floor with our very own toilet, for an extra $200.

It was small and cramped. However, the location couldn't be beat and it was cheap for London standards. I wouldn't stay there with kids, but just for us adults, it worked out nicely. You can walk to Victoria Station to get anywhere around town. We walked to Parliament, Westminster Abbey, and Buckingham Palace pretty easily. It seems to be family run and the staff was very friendly. If we asked for anything, they were on it quickly. It could definately use a renovation.

Location: Excellent. Minutes' walk from Victoria train and coach stations, lots of restaurants and grocery stores in the area. When you come out of the underground at Victoria, you have to walk through the train station and up another set of escalators to exit near the coach station and Belgrave Road. There are actually tons of hotels in the area. The Dover is literally next door to the Calvados, Easy Hotel, Winchester, across the street from the Stanley, and around the corner from the Blair Victoria. The Comfort Inn and Quality Hotel Westminster are also in the area, amongst numerous others. Room: The room was actually not as horrible as we had expected. Twin room was very small. We didn't have any problems with bad smells and the room and bathroom were fairly neat and clean, although obviously old and run-down. It was by no means nice and it lacked any semblance of charm, but it was ok for a few days. Provided in the room were a small TV with 3 channels (one of which was in German); kettle with provisions for tea; alarm clock; functional hairdryer; and a small desk. The bathroom was miniscule and no toiletries were provided except for soap, but it was kept clean and mold-free. Fresh white towels were also provided. Breakfast: Breakfast was actually quite disappointing. It was vending machine coffee, self-serve cereal and juice, and white toast. The ladies in the breakfast room seemed chronically depressed but were helpful enough. Service: Front-desk service was friendly. Our room was not cleaned on the second day but fresh towels were brought up to our room immediately after we informed the front desk. Value: We felt the hotel was way overpriced for what you get, but in consideration of the extortionate hotel prices in London, this is probably true of most hotels in the city. Overall: Our stay was comfortable enough, location was fantastic, free wifi was a definite bonus, breakfast was terrible, value for money was lacking. Would recommend finding another better quality hotel online for similar price if possible. Also would recommend taking the public buses for sightseeing rather than the underground, as a daily bus pass is cheaper than a subway pass and you get to see the sights as you travel.", "Date": "September 10, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "manchester", "Title": "\u201cDont Go There\u201d", "Author": "manchester99", "ReviewID": "UR8116460", "Content": "The room had an awful smell , the carpet up the stairs was threadbare and dangerous.

We found out about the Dover Hotel thanks to Trip Advisor: reading other travellers' reviews, it seemed to be not too bad... so we decided to try it! We booked our double room with ensuite shower one month earlier, and then we started praying: we already knew taht hotels and B&B around Victoria station in London are usually terribles, and we have to say we have a very very high clenliness standard... Well, we arrived very late in the night, just looking for a loo and a bed. What a surprise! Staff people were very friendly and helpful. The room was very small, but incredibly clean, with immaculate sheets and pillow; face and body towels were white and clean too; although the carpet, the curtains and in general the furniture were not brand new (especially the carpet on the stairs was quite old), everything was clean and well keeped. The bathroom, not bigger than a train toilet, but deeply clean, I would say shining!!! Bed was comfortable and room quiet, maybe too hot, but this is not a problem: you just have to keep the window slightly open (as we did). We got facilities in the room to make tea and coffee: I expected a stinky, crusty kettle, but it was very clean, and the cups too. We had every night a warm and nice tea in our room! The buffet breakfast consisted of a lot of warm toasts, a good choice of cold and hot beverages, cereals, butter and jam. You can eat as much as you like! The brakfast room is quite small, but this we'll give you the chance to meet other people from all over the world - we enjoyed our breakfast with 2 german guys, talking and laughing a lot!!! The hotel is 3 minutes walking to Victoria train station and 5 minutes to Victoria coach station: this means you are very close to all the strategic points to start your tour around London. With a longer walk you can easily reach interesting places like Buckingham Palace, St. James Park, Westminster Abbey. The place around is safe and quiet, even if you get back late in the night. We will definetely be back to te Dover Hotel. Of course is not the Ritz, its a cheap and simple accommodation, but it was so clean, comfortable and friendly that we decided the Dover hotel is OUR hotel in London!

The shower got warm and everything. About the room itself: It wasn't the biggest and not the smallest, not the newest but clean enough, and it had all the things it needed. Bed was okay, clean sheets, as 2 people you do definitely have to be a couple though - no space for polite distance! The television was lovely, the teamaking facilities were there - my main criticism is that they had whitening powder instead of proper milk!
