Getting to the hotel, we suggest that you use the hotel shuttle service. We checked the practicality of using the metro and then transferring to the T1 tram. The problem lies in getting from Aksary metro station to Yusufpasa tram stop. You will have a long, inconvenient walk which will include going down and then up the steps of a highway underpass, another walk, and then up and down the stairs of the overpass leading to the platform of the tram stop. Also, it will require your buying from an automatic vending machine two separate tokens at 1.75 TL each (note that different modes of transport can use different types of token, for instance, metal rather than plastic). In Istanbul changing from one mode of transport to another usually requires your having to buy a new token. To get to the airport from the hotel, you can find local shuttle services in the vicinity of the hotel for as low as 5 TL. The hotel can also arrange for your pick up. Note that if you will visit Istanbul for an extended period and use public transport extensively, consider buying an \"Akbil\" travel pass (a small metal disk on a plastic handle with multiple trips encoded which you can conveniently recharge at vending machines). The Akbil (which you touch at a point in front of entry turnstiles) makes it convenient to use all types of public transport, gives you a small discount on the fare, and makes transfers both easier and cheaper. Remember to collect the refund on your Akbil deposit before you leave the city. All the staff we encountered at the hotel were exceptionally welcoming, friendly, cooperative and hospitable. The service that they rendered to us would have done credit to a five star hotel. In particular, Vesyl at reception was extremely amiable, charming and helpful; Baris was very pleasant and efficient (having replied promptly and fully to all our e-mails arranging a reservation and pick-up at the airport). Vele and Ibrahim were attentive to the needs of guests at breakfast and at other times during their shifts, for instance serving us tea and coffee when we returned exhausted from an active day of sightseeing. Every day Ilke and Nebibe consistently and reliably made up our room, and replaced toiletries and bottled water that we had used. For our purposes of exploring as much as possible of Istanbul and surrounding areas on foot and by public transport, the location of the hotel on Nobethane Caddesi in Sirkeci was superb. Nobethane Caddesi is a small street, recently completely repaved, one block away from the main street, Hudavendigar Caddesi, along which the T1 tram passes and will take you to major tourist sites. If you would like a base convenient to historic sites, restaurants, shops, and to tram, train, bus and ferry services, you could hardly find a more central point for starting your day of sightseeing. For those of us who enjoy walking as a way of absorbing the atmosphere of a city, the following details provide a rough estimate of walking-strolling times from the hotel to places of major interest: local restaurants 1-10 minutes; T1 tram stop \"Gulhane\" (closer, more convenient and 3-4 mins. to the hotel) or \"Sirkeci\" 4-6 mins. (in both directions which it travels, the convenient, modern trams will take you to most major tourist sights or to a stop only a short walk away); Sirkeci train station and the tourist office outside (10 a.m. to 6 p.m.) 5-7 mins.; ferry terminals 10-15 mins.; Yeni (New) Mosque (fabulous tiled interior and my favorite mosque) and Egyptian (Spice) Bazaar 12-17 mins.; bus terminal at and Galata Bridge 15-20 mins.; Gulhane Parki, Archeological Museum, Topkapi Palace 15-20 mins.; Hagia Sofia (breathtaking interior; better visited at the end of the day when most of the tour groups have gone and afternoon light floods the interior; note that the guards start shepherding visitors to leave more than an hour before \"official\" closing at 7 p.m. and try to have everyone out by 6:30 p.m. at the latest), Blue Mosque, and Turkish and Islamic Arts Museum, Binbirdirek Cistern 20-25 mins.; Grand Bazaar 25-30 mins. The rooms we used were suitably appointed and of adequate size to move around and to open a suitcase on the parquet floor. The bathroom had a shower stall of reasonable size; it did not have a bathtub or bidet. The hot water system worked well, except for one morning; staff had the service fixed promptly and apologized for the interruption. We found the bed and the pillows (two per person but you can ask for more) comfortable. The air conditioning worked well. We had the hotel remove the beverages (for purchase) that they provided in the small bar fridge so that we could use the space for items that we bought at a small, convenience supermarket (which had a limited selection of basic items) a few minutes walk away on Hudavendigar Caddesi (the main street one block away). The coffee and tea making facilities in the room included a selection of ordinary and herbal teas. The free WiFi connection worked flawlessly during our stay. (Opposite the reception counter in the entrance were a desktop and a laptop computer for the use of guests who did not bring their own computer.) Smoking was not a problem as most guests did not smoke and the staff smoked outside the hotel. If a previous guest had smoked in your room, you could air it out quite easily by fully opening the French doors at your convenience. The flat screen TV satellite service provided scores of international channels in numerous languages. There were two remote controls. The red button at the top of the larger one marked \"Vestel\" turned the display on and off and controlled the volume. The smaller one marked \"botech\" turned the satellite TV service on and off, and controlled the selection of channels and, to some degree, also the volume. On the smaller remote control, pressing OK displayed a list of 10 channels, the left arrow showed the next 10 down and the right arrow the next 10 up, the up arrow selected the next individual channel above, the down arrow the next channel below, and pressing OK made the list disappear and displayed the channel highlighted. At the back of the ground floor was the breakfast room (buffet breakfast available 7:30 a.m. to 10:30 a.m.). The choice did not vary during our stay; however, the selection was sufficiently broad that we could concentrate on different combinations on different mornings according to how we felt. The choice included: tea, coffee, milk, orange and pomegranate juices, three cereals (four on our last day), bread (you could toast), bread rolls, butter, several jams, honey, cream cheese, hazelnut-chocolate spread, three types of cheese, two types of sausage, raisins, dried apricots and figs, two types of cake slices, sweet biscuits, pastry roll slices, sliced fresh tomato, sliced fresh cucumber, hard-boiled eggs, plain yogurt, black and green olives, oranges and apples. The hotel had a personal feel because of its small size (we counted 16 rooms distributed over seven floors) and the warmth of the staff. Room 101 on the ground floor opened directly into the back of the breakfast room. The second, third and fourth floors had three rooms each: one in the front facing Nobethane Caddesi, one in the middle facing the back and one in the far back at the end of a corridor. The fifth, sixth and seventh floors had two rooms each: one in the front facing the street and one in the back. The front room we had first was reasonably spacious, and furnished with both a king and a twin bed, and a sofa plus a desk, stool (I suggest replacing stools with chairs which have a back), easy chairs, bedside tables (the addition of table lamps for reading at night and stronger room lights would brighten rooms), etc. The lift-elevator (small and suitable for two people, three at most) and stairs were just outside the door. In the room, triple-glazed French doors when closed admitted only minor street noise such as occasional car horns and persons shouting (the narrow street is not a main thoroughfare so carries only limited traffic). These sounds should be less of an issue the higher up your room. During our stay, workers were digging up, excavating, laying pipes and re-laying the street, even at night, (the work would be well finished by the time you read this review) so we moved to a back room. The staff were extremely obliging in this transfer. Vesyl recommended that we wait for room 403, which had no other room above, and it worked out quite well. The back rooms look over Sirkeci train station (the destination of the Orient Express and featured in an Agatha Christie mystery \u00e2\u20ac\u201d have a look in the station restaurant) toward Galata and its tower in the distance. You might also be able to glimpse the water of the Golden Horn and passing ferries. Room 403 has a small terrace with a round cafe table and two chairs. Room 502 has a large terrace with patio furniture. Rooms 602 and 702 have small fire escape balconies. The x02 rooms are set back so do not have as much of a view because to the right is the side wall and back of another, large hotel. The doors of the rooms on the seventh floor face the lift-elevator machinery; also, one has to walk up the stairs from the sixth floor to reach the rooms. In our back room, which had a king size bed, the triple-glazed French doors blocked the entry of outside noise quite effectively. There is some construction at the side of Sirkeci station for a tunnel which will connect the European and Asian shores; however, with the French door closed we did not hear anything from the work which might have been going on. Around the hotel there are lots of restaurants at various prices and quality. The one next to the hotel entrance actually belongs to the hotel. We did not eat there because we thought the prices a bit high for the dishes listed on the menu. If no one offers you a discount, ask for one before eating there. Two (parallel) streets up from the hotel, pedestrian Ibni Kemal Caddesi is lined with restaurants. Opposite the front of Sirkeci train station are a McDonalds and a Burger King, if you feel like conventional western fast food. The pedestrian walk under Galata Bridge itself is lined on both sides with fish restaurants and bars and in Galata itself there are numerous restaurants along the many side lanes of Istiklal Caddesi \u00e2\u20ac\u201d the main, pedestrian shopping street and center of night life (accessible on foot from the hotel, about 20-30 mins., but uphill once you have crossed Galata Bridge). We found the lack of internal soundproofing insufficient to prevent a night's sleep (as the hotel was quiet when everyone had settled in), but enough to prevent an uninterrupted night's sleep because of different guests leaving and returning to their rooms at different times (which normally happens in a hotel). If you sleep soundly, the following details should not affect you; however, some of us are a bit sensitive to extraneous noises. The room doors and their frames are not soundproofed (wood-against-wood with nothing in between). This means that sounds from the corridor and stairwell can enter the room. In fact, attractive as the doors might be (suitable perhaps for private apartments), they do not seem suitable for hotel rooms. Some sounds which can come into the room: people commonly slamming their room door, even on other floors (which we knew of from our initial enquiries, but did not know the extent of); attempts to fit a key into, and the opening and closing of room door locks (conventional metal key and spring-loaded metal tongue lock); people's shoes as they clip-clop up or down the stone stairs \u00e2\u20ac\u201d partially screened by panels of sheetrock but otherwise open and connected between floors; water flowing when someone in a center x02 room takes a shower (the ventilation port opens into the corridor), conversation if people linger in the corridor (for instance, waiting for the lift-elevator or saying goodnight to others), cleaners preparing rooms, any other noise of activity outside the room. The owners could cheaply and easily alleviate this deficiency. On the door of each room, they could install heavy-duty, institutional-grade door closers (the mechanisms which automatically and gradually close a door so that it cannot be slammed) and ensure that they are properly adjusted for rates of closing and latching. They could also install a seal around the entire frame and the threshold or around the entire door so that it acoustically isolates the room from the corridor. Were it not for the lack of internal soundproofing, I might have given this type of hotel my first rating of Excellent from all the modest hotels around the world which my partner and I have stayed at; hence, given the superb staff, exceptional service and outstanding location, I will leave it at Very Good. A last note about the back of the hotel. Just to the side there is a yellow, emergency electric power generator about the size of half a cargo container. It belongs to another building. If there is a power failure (which occurred during the street works when an excavator cut the electricity cable to the area), it will start automatically. When it operates, it sounds like a mechanical jackhammer. You can hardly hear it at the front of the hotel, but will hardly avoid hearing it in the back should it start. A power failure should be an exceptional and rare event, so for greater quiet I would still prefer a room at the far back of the hotel.", "Date": "June 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "puerto rico", "Title": "\u201cN\u00c4\u00b1ce hotel good people\u201d", "Author": "itsme8976", "ReviewID": "UR113291851", "Content": "Stayed at GALATA ISTANBUL HOTEL for 2 weeks and enjoyed every moment.

The bathroom newly refurbished, power shower, I wish my own looked like this! Superb experience!

Pre-arrival Baris had been extremely helpful with information and speedy communication. A good first impression! On arrival we were shown to our terrace room on the 5th floor which had french doors opening onto a large terrace. Admittedly, the terrace was in amongst the back of various buildings and was a bit noisy but you could see the river and the Galata tower. The terrace could really be very beautiful if they put some plants out there. I think the hotel has been recently refurbished and the room itself was modern and very clean and the en-suite was small but modern. Breakfast was good and varied but room 102 seemed to open onto the breakfast area - this mihgt bother some who get woken easily... We asked for dinner recommendations and were taken persnally by one of the guys to a restaurant they recommended. We also booked dinner at 360 (Definitely recommended) and the hotel reserved for us and arranged a taxi. It was easily walkable though and we came back on foot over the Galata bridge. All in all I would definitely recommend this hotel for the friendly staff, cleanliness and great location. The location of the hotel is excellent with the Blue Mosque, bazaars, Hagia Sophia only a few minutes walk away!", "Date": "October 21, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney, Australia", "Title": "\u201cFabulous!\u201d", "Author": "Diane255060", "ReviewID": "UR82940447", "Content": "Clean comfortable room, great breakfast, helpful & friendly staff.

Overall a great place to say! There are only two things that I will mention, just in case it is important for anyone. The lift is small, we could only fit one of us in at a time with our luggage, but without our luggage it was fine. Also, if you get any laundry done, they give it to people up the road to do and they charge a lot. They charge on weight so make sure you only put in what you really want/need washed. We learnt the hard way, so I would suggest that you ask the total price before you agree to go ahead, and make sure you say you don't want things ironed if you don't want to pay extra.", "Date": "October 6, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bucharest, Romania", "Title": "\u201cExcellent\u201d", "Author": "turizim", "ReviewID": "UR77078904", "Content": "we love this hotel, perfect location, everything is wonderful so kind and so nice staff highly recommended", "Date": "August 27, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ashburn, Virginia", "Title": "\u201cexcellent staff, comfortable, clean new accomodation, close to historic sights, complimentary tea throughout the day.\u201d", "Author": "amera1234", "ReviewID": "UR72615582", "Content": "very welcoming and flexible staff, great service, complimentary breakfast.
