The first hurdle was finding the hotel - taxi driver didn`t have a clue, and had to phone a few people to find out where it was; even though we had the address written down, ready for him. Not the most auspicious start, really. The hotel is situated midway along a sidestreet - there are plenty of local shops, supermarkets, metro station etc. all within easy walking distance. We`d just disembarked a cruise; it was approx 10.00 a.m. when we arrived. We fully expected that the room wouldn`t be ready, but we wanted to drop the luggage off, then go explore for a while. So we were somewhat surprised to be told our room (117) was ready! Wow, that`s a promising start. Sure enough, the room was ready - clean enough, little kitchen with all you need for a few days (except the food). The only \"problem\" was that we couldn`t get into the room with our keycard - we had to get maintenance to let us in for the first two days....apparently the keycard machine broke down! The hotel had a ready answer for this......we were moved next door, into 116. So, now we get to the things you \"need to know\" regarding the rooms: 1. All the electrical equipment supplied in both our rooms was 2 pin, european plugs. 2. All the sockets in the room were british 3 pin. You need an adaptor, but probably the exact opposite of the ones you normally take! 3. There were bedside lights on the tables; but, in room 116, there isn`t a socket within reach of one side off the bed - and the other side is a bit of a stretch to the nearest socket. 4. The supplied kettle was leaking onto the base - took it to the maintenance guy, who apparently \"mended\" it ......by making it leak more than it did to start with. After a bit more arguing with the young girl at reception (who we`ll get back to later), another kettle was provided. 5. The \"double room\", as is often the case, is 2 single beds pushed together. What surprised me was they were individually made; i.e. as 2 single beds. 6. The \"view\". This is probably the worst issue, aesthetically speaking. The windows have, in all likelihood, never been cleaned. You`ll need to open the window, to know whether its light or dark outside; and all we could see was the back of an equally dirty building, 6 metres away across an alley. ***** The \"restaurant\"***** We (luckily) chose not to eat there the first night. The hotel don`t have their own kitchens - the food is carried across the alley from the indian restaurant next door (breakfast, lunch and evening meal). Apparently, the first night was a very poor choice of 3 \"things\", unidentified, which were supposed to be served hot, but weren`t. By way of apology, the management offered a free transfer to Mamzar beach the next day. The breakfasts weren`t bad (but I usually only have cereal, toast and coffee - difficult to mess up). There were \"hot\" options, which changed daily - all I can say is they looked nice enough. Reception - specifically staff attitudes. We saw three reception staff during our stay. The young girl mentioned above, a youngish guy and an older man. The young man was pleasant, polite, helpful, friendly. The older man was \"alright\"; but the young girl. I`m not sure what to say, to be honest, other than \"avoid if at all possible\". There is a rooftop pool. But there is limited sunbed space; a wall so high you can hardly see any of the view; and it was closed off for most of our stay. Would I return to this hotel? Not if I had a choice. I`d have given it two and a half stars perhaps.", "Date": "January 16, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Edinburgh, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201c2 Star Hotel AlManar Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Colin F", "ReviewID": "UR122516712", "Content": "I have just returned from this Hotel and I would not rate it anymore than a two star hotel,we stayed in the Arbain Park Hotel which was a 3 star hotel on 18th December 2011 and it was certainly of a higher standard than the Al Manar.

The hotel is a ten minute taxi drive to the Al mamzar beach park costs around 14 dirhams \u00a32.50 entry fee to the park is five dirhams \u00a30.90p. There is a pool area, place to eat, male/female changing area and a lovely beach. The gold and spice souk/market are not far away if you like that kind of thing. I would recommend going to the Wild Wadi Water park great fun for adults and kids and you can get some great pictures of the Burj Al Arab. We went bed and breakfast. The breakfast is not the best i've had on holiday however its not the worst. The only other downside is there are no fantastic views from your room as there is a construction site next door however we hardly noticed it as we spent most of the day sight seeing. Noise you cannot notice as all windows are fully double glazed. The staff are quite friendly and always willing to help. There is a small pool on the rooftop with sun loungers a shower area and toilets for that all important tan! Location wise its ok, however if you decide to travel to the Jumeirah end it will cost by taxi around 60 dirhams \u00a310 each way and more if you venture futher afield. There is now the partially completed dubai metro(un manned automatic train Like the DLR in London) which you you can get around town with running from Jebal Ali to Rashidya called the red line started 7 weeks ago. However from the hotel you need to get a taxi to Deira city centre station 10 mins away. Its very modern and very clean with the average single trip costing 4/5 dirhams less than \u00a31.00. You can buy a silver card for 6 dirhams and top it up as you go. (A bit like an oyster card on the London underground but way cheaper ! The green line will be completed by mid 2010. The only other thing is that you must get into the right compartment as there is a women and children only carriage the others are mixed. Perfect if you want to go to the emirates mall. There are a good few places to eat nearby the hotel serving western and indian food. I quite enjoyed the iranian chicken sandwich made in fresh bread from accross the road. Drinks are very cheap too stock up as you will need it due to the heat ! I would recommend this hotel to anyone on an average budget.", "Date": "October 26, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "africa", "Title": "\u201cOk rooms construction next door\u201d", "Author": "Geminidreams", "ReviewID": "UR29034240", "Content": "Room was nice and modern. Had reasonable size bedroom large tv, kitchen, big fridge so of for extended stay. There was construction of building next door and noise was an issue but it stopped at nightfall. Dont like these Dubai hotels wanting to hold passports. I have stayed at 2 4 points and they scanned passports and returned them in 5 min so I dont understand why others take hours and complain when you ask for them back right qaway. Dont really know about the location. It was opposite direction to central hotels I normally stay at and probably 15 - 20 min from main terminals. I stayed as a Dubai stopover as I had a long connection and my wife needed visa so ended up here. Good point was the free shuttle to the airport.", "Date": "April 29, 2009"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "AlManar Hotel Apartments", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g295424-d1057300-Reviews-AlManar_Hotel_Apartments-Dubai.html", "Price": "$60 - $196*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">24th Hor Al Anz East</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Dubai</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">POB 62495</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">United Arab Emirates</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "1057300", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/d0/ea/d0eae8ecae2b9c34986032e4d0fcff7a3large.jpg"}}
