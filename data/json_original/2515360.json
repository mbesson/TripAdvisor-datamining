After dropping the car off at MasterPark and waiting 10 minutes ( it takes about 5 minutes to drive there) MasterPark personal called the desk who said the van would be right down. Ten minutes later when the van had not arrived Master Park called the desk again who told them that the van had gone to the airport and it would be at least 10 minute longer. MasterPark took pity on me and drove me to the hotel (Many Thanks!) . When I expressed my displeasure to the clerk for being abandoned at the parking lot ( it was late and I only had a few hours before our flight) I got a shoulder shrug as a response. To offset the miserable desk service, when we took the van to the airport a few hours later, we were treated to one of the great van drivers in our experience- his upbeat cheeriness at that hour of the morning and excellent service restarted our trip on a much better note. Our flight was too early for the hotel's complementary breakfast- but that is life. The rooms are functional but little else; internet is complementary which is a plus.

We cannot say enough about the kindness shown the children and ourselves. The desk staff are quick at check-in/out and room service from the Sharps Roaster Ale House next door is always prompt.

We always walk away more than satisfied and the children look forward to breakfast before flying out. The business center is well supplied and complimentary. Access is controlled by the front desk so there are no children in the way when you need to print tickets or check email. Computers are up to date. Although a pool/ spa would be a nice addition, they offer a small fitness room that has limited equipment that is adequate to get a decent workout. The property offers airport shuttle service and while we have never waited more than 10 minutes to get the shuttle, we have begun to walk to and from the airport just to stretch our legs a little more.

I did learn to ask for a room that doesn't have a connecting door (you never know if the person in the next room snores or tends to talk loud on the phone at 3 a.m.) and that makes all the difference in the world - quiet and relaxing. Of course, this is true for most hotels, never get a room with a connecting door, always ask. The rooms are clean, furniture and bedding in excellent repair, the wireless high-speed Internet access in each room is amazingly fast, there is a mini fridge and microwave, as well as a coffee maker with an ample supply of coffee, etc., and the bathroom is well lit and comfortable with all the items one would need while traveling. You can either have a room facing International Blvd or the airport. On the airport side you would never know you were within walking distance of the jumbo jets unless you looked out the window, good soundproofing. The airport shuttle, I believe, runs about ever 15 minutes or you can go to the front desk and let them know you need the shuttle and they will radio the driver to alert him or her that a guest is waiting. I've never had a problem with this, and the drivers always help me with my bags and are friendly and knowledgeable of the airport - just tell them where you need to go at Seatac and they will make sure you are dropped off as close to the area you need to be as they can get you. During my last visit I needed to catch the Kenmore Air shuttle to Boeing Field to fly to Port Angeles (I live on the Olympic Peninsula) and the shuttle driver drove me right to the pickup spot where the shuttle would be arriving a few minutes later. The front desk staff are courteous, friendly, and very helpful. During my last stay I had arrived on the spur of the moment without a reservation and they had me in their computer system as a Coast Rewards member with my preferences, etc., and quickly checked me in, literally within 2 minutes flat. Non-connecting room, in the corner like I prefer, facing International Blvd. You can't beat that type of service, and they do it with a smile! The room service at this hotel is EXCELLENT. The restaurant next door, Sharp's Roaster & Ale House, provides room service from 11 to 10 PM on weekdays and noon to 10 PM on weekends.

Their staff is just as friendly and helpful at the Coast Gateway staff, and as a habit when I stay at Coast Gateway I'm on the phone to room service ordering my salad for dinner.

I only stayed here one night with my girlfriend at the tail-end of a trip which included Vancouver, B.C., Canada and Seattle, USA. Our stay was on July 31, 2005. My experiences with Priceline[-] have been mixed. When selecting a \"4-star\" hotel, the quality has been quite good; however, results for 3-star hotels vary considerably. I used Priceline[-] in the USA and was booked into the 4-star Hyatt Regency in Dallas for $70 USD. Great deal. I used Priceline[-] to book while I was in Vancouver, Canada and obtained a price of $75 USD for the Hyatt Regency (good price). These previous bookings on Priceline were for 4-star hotels. For the TWO recent occasions when I booked with Priceline[-] for 3-star hotels, they have both been disappointments. Like several other reviewers of THIS particular hotel (Seattle Coast Gateway Hotel by the SeaTac Airport), phone calls to the hotel to make requests such as my preference to stay in a non-smoking room were treated rudely and no ATTEMPT at accommodation was made. They said disparaging things about Priceline[-] and were basically saying \"you get what you pay for\" (which to the hotel staff means \"bad service for low price\"). When the front staff noted that my reservation was based on Priceline[-] prices, they were very curt, rude, and unhelpful. They said that they cannot take ANY requests if I booked on Priceline. Frankly speaking, I ended up paying a few dollars more than their regular rate on Priceline[-] based on their \"bidding\" process. I recall paying about $90 USD for a one-night stay. Considering this, they still were very unhelpful and rude. You may want to also check out my COMPREHENSIVE TripAdvisor review for the Crowne Plaza Hotel Georgia in Vancouver, B.C., Canada. A similarly poor experience resulted from the front desk seeing a Priceline[-] reservation. You can read my review directly by copy & pasting this URL: http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g154943-d181923-r3816695-Crowne_Plaza_Hotel_Georgia-Vancouver_British_Columbia.html The room quality was more like a cheap motel you see traveling through the middle-of-nowhere in rural areas. The mattress quality was very bad. It was not firm or supportive. I suspect the mattress coils were worn out and the bed needed replacement. The quality of the bed covers reminded me of the cheap blankets they hand out in economy-class airlines if you are taking an evening flight. They were neither warm nor comfortable. The \"bathroom\" was fairly interesting as well. The sink was not located in the bathroom. It was located just off the bedroom area. The toilet and shower were in the same (very small) room. While the shower was of the \"shower in bathtub\" variety, it was barely even a \"half-tub\". The shower area was very minimal. We literally stayed in the hotel no more than 5 hours that evening as we had to make it back to Vancouver, Canada to make a 7:45 a.m. flight... so we had to leave at 3 a.m. The hotel had no room service at that hour so we had to walk down the street to a 24-hour Denny's Restaurant. While the location of the hotel may be conveniently located close to the airport, the quality of this hotel negated this \"benefit\". I noted that there was a nice \"Doubletree Hotel\" across the street from this hotel. It looked much nicer. That hotel name is: Doubletree Hotel Seattle Airport. The downside of booking on Priceline[-] is that you cannot get a refund after your booking is confirmed... otherwise I would have gotten OUT of this hotel! At any rate, while I cannot say that I got to enjoy all the hotel amenities (if there were any) because of the short-nature of our stay, the service we received on the phone before our arrival combined with the very low-quality (1 or 2 star) quality room... makes it necessary to highly UN-RECOMMEND this hotel. STAY AWAY FROM THIS HOTEL. You are warned. Kudos & admiration to a previous reviewer of this hotel who choked up the cost and decided to stay elsewhere despite losing his money because of the poor phone service he received prior to his anticipated stay. If booking on Priceline[-], beware of \"3-star\" rated hotels. You probably should try bidding on a 4-star hotel and cross your fingers for a good price. 3-star hotels do NOT seem to treat Priceline customers very well.

After using priceline on many occassions, I have always asked for non-smoking rooms and two beds. Even though I know it is not guaranteed, every hotel has always been pleasant and accommodating, until this one. My first call I was lied to and told there were no rooms available for the night we were to stay and we would get what we get. After checking online and reserving the room I wanted I emailed the company asking if there was a better way to handle this. I received no response. On my second call directly to the hotel, I again was informed that there were no other rooms available and that they would not accommodate priceline customers. The next day I called to see if the reservation I made online could be swapped for the priceline room (I would keep the reservation and then cancel upon arrival). The response was more than rude, I was informed that they were definately not full for the night we were to stay but under no curcumstances would they let us have a non-smoking room with two beds.

Overall the hotel was very clean from the carpets in the halls to the bed in my room. The bed was very firm, which was a bit uncomfortable for me on the first night since I wasn't accustomed to sleeping in such a firm bed. The room was equipped with a microwave, small refrigerator, an iron and ironing board, plus a coffee maker. Given that it borders the airport and is on a busy street, I was surprised that the noise from outside of the hotel was not an issue. Instead my main noise complaint was with the plumbing. I expect to hear water running through the pipes at a hotel but this seemed overly loud. Closing the door to the bathroom mitigated the noise enough so that it wouldn't wake me up at night when the people in rooms above me were flushing the toilet or taking a shower. The door to the room didn't seem to be great at blocking out noise from the hall (including the lobby area if you're on the first floor), but it was generally quiet in these areas so this wasn't a problem. Vending machines seemed a bit limited on the property. I tried the vending facilities on both the first and fourth floors, which had mostly Coca-Cola products in cans for a dollar (Coke, Diet Coke, Sprite, Fanta Orange, Barq's, and Dasani water) and typical snacks. The first floor soda machine was sold out of just about everything on the day I checked out. Parking is quite limited but I never encountered a completely full parking lot during my stay. Some spaces are an insanely tight fit that would work only for people driving subcompact cars. The checkout process was efficient. I do wish that the hotel employee checking me out could have at least uttered the words \"thank you\" after handing me a receipt detailing a couple hundred dollars worth of credit card charges. This isn't a problem at all specific to the Coast Gateway, but is a pet peeve of mine at hotels (and other businesses) in general. The Coast Gateway Hotel was sufficient for my few nights stay as a tourist, but if I'm ever back in the area again I'll probably try my chances at another hotel.", "Date": "May 22, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Middle Island, NY", "Title": "\u201cNoisy and old\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3262980", "Content": "Based on the positive reviews, I booked a stay for a short weekend trip at the Coast Gateway Hotel. I am usually not disappointed with tripadvisor reviews. This is one of the few exceptions. I do not recommend this hotel. I agree that the lobby, dining room, and hallways are pleasant and clean. The breakfast is adequate (enjoyable \"make your own waffle\"). However, the room I stayed in was old and noisy (expect 5-6 am wake up calls from dump-trucks). There were cracks in the sink. The cramp bathroom had a shower door that swung outward causing the bathroom floor to get thoroughly wet every time you exit the shower. Because of this, the tiled floor was discolored with mildew. I do not know if the managing staff feels that the customers are just the \"fly-in/fly-out\" kinds, and do not feel that there is a need to obtain customer loyalty. Oh well, I am flying into Seatac again next week and will try my luck at another hotel.", "Date": "March 9, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3260126", "Content": "I stayed at the Sea Tac location in March 2005.This Hotel exceeded my expectations.

They were even very understanding and helpful when we were nearly four hours late in arriving after being Dollar-rent-a-cared for most of the night trying to get our rental car.
