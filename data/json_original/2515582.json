Our room was a solitaire suite with a strip view, and it was absolutely amazing. Not only was the room spotless and devoid of that stale smoke smell that plagues so many of Vegas' other hotels, but the views from the large picture window in the bedroom, and from the balcony off the living room were fantastic at night. The mountains in the distance provided a lovely backdrop for the glowing neon and LED lights of the Stratosphere, Wynn, Encore, Palazzo, Venetian, Trump and other casino hotels. Our interaction with the staff was equally impressive. Each hotel employee we encountered was attentive and courteous. Everyone from the valets, to check-in staff, to bartenders, to restaurant waiters, seemed to truly care about the experience that we were having, and went out of their way to make sure every detail was just right. I have especially high praise for the bartender at Stir Lounge, Daniel, and the waiter/bartender at the hotel's Kil@wat restaurant, Brian, for their exceptional service and positive attitudes. The Kil@wat restaurant was a tasty, if pricey, option for breakfast/brunch, and featured mammoth portions of very well-prepared breakfast staples like bacon, eggs, and pancakes. They also have a limited lunch/entree menu, but we didn't order anything other than breakfast during our stay. We skipped room service due to the abundant food offerings available near the hotel. I'd recommend stocking your own bar with beer and liquor from the AM/PM Mart right next to the hotel or from the package store across the street rather than paying the crazy prices for room bottle service. When you're ready to explore the wilder side of Vegas, the strip is only a two-block walk from the Platinum Hotel. Ballys and The Flamingo are the closest major gambling casinos, with Paris, Caesar's Palace and the Bellagio another couple blocks away. With such a perfect location in the middle of the strip, and exceptional hospitality and service, the Platinum Hotel has assured a repeat visit from my wife and me.", "Date": "April 27, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "los angeles", "Title": "\u201cConsistency\u201d", "Author": "chirotine", "ReviewID": "UR128656050", "Content": "This will have been our 2nd stay at the Platinum.

It was a good location; about a 10 minute walk to the Strip near the location of Bally's and Caesar's Palace. And there are multiple buses that go up and down the Strip from there (the Deuce, the Express bus; the 202 bus goes up and down Flamingo Rd). Taxis are accessible, as well. I loved that this was a non-smoking and non-casino hotel. The room was spacious. The kitchen was equipped with the basics. I did have to request some coffee mugs, but they were provided. Complimentary coffee filter packs were provided daily (just be sure to use no more than 5 cups of water, otherwise it's too weak. And use filtered water from the fridge.). The reception staff was very pleasant and helpful, as was the concierge. We had breakfast twice at the hotel restaurant and it was delicious. My only complaint would be the housekeeping staff--it was very erratic and should have greater oversight and supervision. On some days, our room was cleaned well with ample fresh towels provided and dishes washed (in dishwasher). Other days, I noticed a dirty coffee mug placed back in the cabinet and the coffee pot was just emptied and placed back in the coffee maker without cleaning. I did have to request (twice in one day) that the bathtub be cleaned and the room vacuumed (it was getting pretty dusty). It was eventually taken care of, but I should not have had to ask in the first place. I did notice lots of food crumbs between the cabinet and the refrigerator and some small stains on the carpet. This is a lovely hotel with lots of pluses. But the housekeeping does need improvement.

We were in town for 4 days for a soccer tournament and ended up here because it was a non-smoking and non-gaming hotel. The non-gaming aspect is a whatever for me personally but the non-smoking benefit is very nice. I'll start with the good stuff.....no smoking and the staff, as mentioned in other reviews, was very nice and friendly. And that's about it for the positives. Now for the not-so-positives....even though I made rsvp's 4 months in advance for a 2 queen room, we were given an ADA room. Typically, this would be just an inconvenience as the bedroom is tiny and the bathroom is huge but the shower in the room wasn't designed for both sit down and stand up use, as most are, and was only designed for sit down use. Since we were there for 4 days/3 nights, I asked to be put in the room I reserved 4 months prior. I was told they were sold out of the room type I had reserved. Really? We took a room with a King bed and a roll-away. The room left a lot to be desired. The carpets were filthy, in desperate need of a deep clean. The shower floor was nasty, with mold and peeling caulking. The TV in the bedroom was a CRT! When was the last time you could even buy a tube TV? And yes, the TV in the main room was a flat screen but with no HD. When was the last time you even saw programming in standard definition? Maid service was sketchy too. We had to call the front desk for toilet paper, fresh towels, and tissue...twice. Then came the valet service...again the guys were nice but completely understaffed. Keep in mind that there is NO self-parking. They wouldn't allow us to call down early and have the car brought around, we had to go downstairs first and wait, and wait, and wait. As the line continued to grow the lone valet started just handing guests their keys so they could go get their own car. This hotel hasn't been touched since it was built, original carpets, furniture, and technology. Definitely would NOT stay at The Platinum again. If you want to be near the Strip stay ON the Strip.

Internet access was included in the hotel price and there were no resort fee. In addition to the great room the next best thing about the hotel was the incredibly attentive staff. The were very accomodating. Our one meal in the restaurant was good, but they appeared to be a little understaffed and we had to walk around some until someone came out to greet us. The lounge looked cute but was mostly empty. Now here comes the but! I own a housekeeping company and notice things that others may not. Like a previous reviewer named Steve, I did not feel that the hotel was clean. The hallway carpets were not edged properly, the carpet in the room very stained and when I walked on the large tile area in the room my feet got very dirty. This is probably what caused the dirt track from the kitchen area to the bedroom. In addition, there were many spots in the carpet. When I told the room attendent about the dirty rug she was quick to get someone up to address it. When I left that night for dinner, they came in and shampooed the carpet. Impressive, but the carpet clearly needed to be replaced. The floor mats in the bathroom were frayed and should have been discarded. The water in the shower kept changing temperature making for an unpleasant shower. It reminded me of the old days of taking a shower and whenever someone in the house turned on the sink downstairs, the water changed temperature. The pool area was nothing short of a disgrace.Thank goodness the weather was unseasonably cool so that I focused on doing things other than spending time by the pool. It was probably the worst pool area that I have ever experienced while staying in Las Vegas. The chairs were rickety and worn and there was not a palm tree, flower or anything that would enhance the area. Many of the towels needed to be thrown away or used as rags. We left after spending only one hour there and $32 for two drinks. The work out area was under construction and I did not find that out until I walked around the fourth floor several times and then had to call the front desk. I was told that I had to go to the Westin to work out. The walk to the strip was far enough and through less desirable areas that I drove or took a cab whenever I went at night. During the day, it was ok but not normally the type of area that I want to spend time in. I would have graded this hotel lower for me personally, but I needed to be fair. I thought I was getting a boutique hotel but the hotel really was more about the room The room was a 5 if cleaned, but the areas that were also important to me only a 2.

We got around on the bus service but if you want to get to Fremont or somewhere exact go for the express rather than the Duece which can take a long time. If you go for the day ticket it is handy to know that on the other side of the street from the hotel on East Flamingo youcan catch the bus on the same ticket one stop and you are at the main junction with caesars palace / ballagio ect. Same way stop outside Ballys drops you right outside platinum so no 15 minute walk to main strip. Think it was the 202 or similar, only one that uses East Flamingo.

I called the front desk to ask for a different room as I did not want to disturb the partiers. The receptionist responded \"The Platinum Hotel is not a party hotel, We will send up security immediately\". WIthin 2 minutes, security arrived-went to all three rooms, and ended the problem. Apparently they have a one warning policy where when a room is warned there will not be another warning. They do not tolerate wild parties in their rooms.The security team then came and assured us if there was any other concerns, to immediately call them.

We stayed here because we have small children and this ticked the boxes. This would be best described as apartments rather than rooms. Rooms have a kitchen and a lounge separate from the bedroom which was great to use when the baby was asleep. There is also a small laundry hidden in a cupboard. Gorgeous heater! Our room was on the lower level with a view toward the strip and overlooking the pool. During the day the view isnt pretty, but that is Vegas for you. There is a no smoking policy but clearly people abuse that as I saw plenty of butts on the roof just past our balcony. It was pretty cold when we went so we didnt venture to the pool but it looks inviting. We also didnt use the bar area but again that looks great. We did order room service once and the food was great (try the wings!) but pricey - having said that if your not on a tight budget its fine. No casino - which I loved as we dont gamble on a regular basis.The bath in the apartment was soooo big it was great. The staff are amazingly helpful and arranged a babysitter for us from Nannys and Grannies. We had an amazing lady called Kaye P who was on the granny side and i felt sorry for her to have to deal with my active kids!, She bought books and bubbles for the kids. small minor issues was that we had internet included in our package and that wasnt activated or presented to us upon check-in but I didnt ask either. Also, the housekeeping staff didnt knock on the door before entering a couple of times. I read some people saying it is so far from the strip - if you dont like walking for more than 1 minute or mobility impaired, you may need to look elsewhere but seriously the walk is not that bad. As far as feeling safe on the walk, I found walking during the day more daunting as there are a fair few homeless people in Vegas and they openly ask you for donations. I enjoyed the walk - especially after all the food we ate at Ellis Island next door! OMG the ribs...yum! While your here, check out and book in advance \"Dig This\" its amazing for men and women. Getting back to the Hotel, one night we went to see Jersey Boys (again fantastic) and the taxis were very slow so one of the staff drove us in the company car - gave them a tip which i would have given to the taxi - what service, we got there in the nick of time!

The 2100 sf 2 BR huge (doesn't describe it) unit with 2 balconies was wonderful. Since we got it for a fraction of the price I can't really complain. BUT if I were to have paid full price ($399 a night) for this unit I would have said I was extremely disappointed. Mostly due to it's appearances. I arrived on a Sunday morning to a beautiful modern looking facility, however the glass doors that greet you were noticeably smudged and finger printed all over - which a little windex would have cleared up in minutes. They were like that most of the day too. The door men stand around outside talking/smoking. Check in was great - they even offered me free wifi We had time to kill before the room was ready so we checked out the SPA and was disappointed - curtains and just a desk? You couldn't get a feel for it at all so we passed. We had lunch at the restaurant by the pool which as delightful - you could sit outside if you wanted. Friendly wait staff. The pool area looked as if the party around the fire pit from last night hadn't been cleaned up yet. Cushions have on/off and untied. Rather messy out there with cups and stuff blowing around - and it was 10am. When our room was ready (we got early check in) we headed up. As spacious as it was the cleaning staff had done a sub-par job. It smelled as if they used a dirty rag on the kitchen floor. Carpet was frayed at the edge where it met the ceramic tiled foyer. Cushions not put on the couch properly (zipper side exposed), lint on cushions as if they had just been flipped them over. We had a full/washer dryer in the unit - baths were huge and ADA ready. The curtains were coming off the hooks and several were broken and just darn right falling off their bar. They had nice sheers under the drapes so you could have some privacy without total darkness. The balcony had a nice little metal table and four chairs but someone had spilled a red-drink on the concrete and it was never cleaned up - and very sticky. There were also several beer bottles still sitting on the floor of the balcony. Cleaning never even bothered to go and look out there (obviously). I found several plastic things on the floor - that were pulled off new clothes (to hold the tag) so their vacuums did a very poor job. The bed skirt was hanging longer on one side then the other too. It just seemed like cleaning did a 1/2 way job and rushed. The hallways throughout the building needed vacuuming badly. It's unfortunate because the place just looks 'worn' for how nice it is. The place needs some deep cleaning, light painting and curtain repairs for sure. The next day cleaning stopped by at 5pm to clean the room! Unbelievably late in the day and we told her to just skip it - why bother! I think they are run on a small cleaning crew - otherwise the place would be immaculate. From what I gather it was a CONDO sales type building where you would buy the units but when all of them didn't sell they decided to make them into Hotel rentals. If you have kids and need great space and a nice kitchen - this is the place for you. It's 2 blocks from the strip and an easy walk, but you go through open area to get there (strewn with empty beer bottles and wrappers). One block closer would have been better but just a few blocks off the strip and it gets dirty We even saw a dead-beat sleeping under the bushes in the vacant lot next door (I guess that's Vegas!). The view from our balcony was very nice as the sunset and the strip started to light up (def want to stay on Strip side of building). I saw parking ramp/garage but do not know if it's additional money. The bar on the first floor looked high class - however, we never did stop in there. Overall - be prepared to get a lot of room but not a lot of cleanliness. Beds were great! Towels good - the normal ratings would apply to this place on that kind of stuff. Coffee Maker - dishes/silverware - large fridge, dishwasher/full oven and microwave. Granite countertops. Huge dining room table seats 8-10 people.

Stayed at a few places over the years and also have had a separate night at the end of my trip in downtown for a different experience. As far as the strip area hotels concerned my last few visits have been New York New York and Signature. The latter being more comparable to the Platinum. All the reviews about the room quality are exactly right, the rooms are huge and well laid out. The massive breakfast counter was perfect for my notebook and laying out my stuff, loved it while enjoying a coffee or snack. I have the Princess suite but looking now at the floor plans they dont seem to much different from the solitaires so may do that next time. Having a washer / dryer in the room was brilliant, I work out at the gym 2 x day so being able to wash my own stuff was just great. The non smoking aspect is not to be overlooked and a big plus is a state that still is pretty open about smoking. Having free valet parking was good too and I never had to wait more than a couple of minutes. My only small gripes would be 1- The gym is ok, Startrac equipment but not in the best order and the cross trainers took a little work. I used to work with these so now what I'm doing. The entertainment system is a little poor to with just 3 channels to the tv's one of which was not working right. I was pretty much alone though so unlike some hotels where you're fighting for equipment there were no issues here. Its one of the few areas I can think that the Signature scores mush higher, its gym is exceptional. 2- I was on the 6th floor by the dreaded fans, these kicked in and you knew about it, otherwise there was no noise at all and you're not far from the pool and no issues, would have wanted to be a little higher. 3- Some may well be bothered by the location. The comment by a previous reviewer about 7/11 is spot on, you will pass a few folk that you really would like to avoid, shows the less glitzy side of LV and I never felt in any trouble but if I had my wife with me she would not be happy passing these people right by the hotel. Its about 10 minutes to Bally's the nearest main strip hotel. Most strip hotels it can take a while just to get to the front door / outside, at the Platinum at least you are not wading through acres of casino so I doubt the time factor was a huge difference. Again compared to the Signature you had a massive walk there to get to the strip but it was all covered and totally safe. So I'm not sure which I would go back to on a future trip. Alone - then the Platinum and with my wife then possibly the Signature but both are decent choices if you prefer to have a room with more ammenities than a plain hotel room and want to be just a little away from the actual casino.", "Date": "April 3, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver, Canada", "Title": "\u201cFantastic Spring Get Away\u201d", "Author": "twodadsupnorth", "ReviewID": "UR127205356", "Content": "This is a great hotel to stay at while in Vegas.

It is direct and only a couple of blocks for about 12-15 minutes, but there is a short space past an empty lot that I didn't like at night. But cabs are quick and the trip is short, so we walked during the day when there were plenty of others on the street and cabbed at night. Our reservations were in place at the agreed price and check-in was quick. It is not a full service big hotel, so you have to expect a bit less, but for the price it was excellent.", "Date": "April 2, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, CA", "Title": "\u201cBest place for an extended stay\u201d", "Author": "interplanetary", "ReviewID": "UR126924061", "Content": "Yes there are many great reviews already about The Platinum Hotel. \u00a0I have a couple of things to add to what people have already said. \u00a0 The hotel is very quiet which is fantastic as it is a perfect escape from the frenzy of the Las Vegas strip. \u00a0You will not hear a thing in your room and will have a great night's sleep here. \u00a0They are adamant about their non-smoking policy so don't even think about staying here if you plan on smoking. \u00a0You will automatically be charged a $500 fine even for smoking on the balcony and the fine is not negotiable. \u00a0For me, this was a fantastic policy as I suffer from severe asthma. \u00a0Most hotels say their rooms are non-smoking, but I always find them to smell of smoke anyway. \u00a0There is no casino which is a plus. \u00a0You really feel like you're staying in a quiet apartment building, it turns out that some of the units are actually condos. \u00a0This is far more than just a room, it is a one bedroom apartment with a full washer/dryer and a full refrigerator with an oven and a cook-top. \u00a0There are many supermarkets nearby, so you are not forced to eat out all the time which is also a great perk. There are a couple of cons that have been mentioned before, but not very frequently. \u00a0I do not recommend walking around this area at night. \u00a0The 7-eleven is next door to the hotel, so we ran over to get some supplies and were shocked at the people both inside and outside the store. \u00a0There were many edgy fringe characters on the street around the hotel. \u00a0I decided to drive the 3 minutes to the strip after this, even in the day time. \u00a0The second issue I have is just a matter of personal taste. \u00a0I disliked the decor in the room. \u00a0I know a lot of people have described the rooms as plain or neutral. \u00a0All I can say is BEIGE, BEIGE, BEIGE. \u00a0Every surface is beige, the walls, the carpet, the tiled floor all beige, it almost feels institutional. \u00a0The art in the room is sparse and bland as well. \u00a0The rooms are fabulously huge, the amenities incredible, they even have a Bose Wave radio in the living room and large flat screen televisions in the bedroom and the living room. \u00a0On the other hand a lot of people come to Vegas expecting a spectacle in their hotel room, instead this room is all about neutral and quiet. \u00a0I personally didn't like the taste in furniture or decor at all, it feels much more like furnished corporate housing to me. This all said, would I stay here again, absolutely. \u00a0I have stayed at all the fancy flashy hotels in Vegas and if given the choice I would definitely choose to stay at The Platinum again. \u00a0This was the first time that I've had a decent night's sleep on any trip I've taken to Vegas. \u00a0The convenience of having a full kitchen, massive amounts of space and absolute quiet is completely worth \u00a0it to me. \u00a0The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because of the decor and the nasty vibe on the street outside, also it would be great if the hotel had a shuttle to the strip. One last comment, the service here is incredible. \u00a0The valet parker noticed that we came into the hotel with groceries. \u00a0He immediately told the front desk to send pots and pans up for us to cook with. \u00a0A couple of minutes later there was a knock at the door with the delivery and then believe it or not, a couple of minutes after that, the front desk called to make sure that we had received everything we needed and if there was anything else they could help us with. \u00a0Everyone you deal with here is polite and thoughtful, such a refreshing surprise. (One important tip: \u00a0book through the website of The Platinum. \u00a0Not only do they give a AAA discount, but more importantly if you book through them you get free wireless internet in your room and also believe it or not an unheard of 2pm checkout!!!)", "Date": "March 29, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Smithtown, New York", "Title": "\u201cNext time I will make no mistake, and stay here for my entire trip!\u201d", "Author": "barbsab88", "ReviewID": "UR126884268", "Content": "OH MY GOSH.

The bed was very comfortable. The hotel is quiet, looks brand new, no casinos, everything is spic and span. The refrigerator was so helpful with leftovers. It was annoying to have to pay extra for one at other hotels. My only dislike was the valet parking. I can't handle valet. I need to go to my car constantly and I want to get it myself. Plus I would rather get my own car than constantly tip different people to get it for me 5 times a day. I booked through a third party and got a low rate.

The bell boys are real nice and hold doors and carry your bags and will hail a cab every time you ask for one with no complaints.

We had spent a lot of time researching suitable hotels in Vegas prior to our stay and finally decided on the Platinum ... with no resort fees, no smoking, no casino, within walking distance of the strip and great value rates it really was an easy decision in the end. We booked a Princess Suite Strip View Room. It was late evening when we checked in. It cost $20 incl tip for taxi from airport (no tunnel). We were allocated a room on the 16th Floor with amazing views of the Strip. Our suite was great ... good size kitchen and living space and balcony. Our bedroom was huge ... two queen beds and an abundance of space. The bathroom was even bigger with separate bath and shower, double sinks and closet space. A washer/dryer just off the kitchen. We really were very happy that it lived up to our expectations. There was also free WiFi. After we had a look around and freshened up we went to the 7 Eleven Store next to the hotel to buy some food for breakfast etc. It really was well stocked and we got all we needed. We really saved money by making our breakfast every morning in our room. I have a bad back and so I didn\u2019t find the beds especially comfortable. On Christmas Morning there was homemade cookies and a candy can hanging from our door handle which was such a lovely surprise and a nice touch. We have been away a few Christmas and no hotel we stayed in has ever done anything like that. It took us no more than 15 minutes to walk to the Strip from the hotel. On one or two evenings it did become a bit of a pain to walk back again but once you got back to the hotel to the peace and quiet it was worth it. I used the gym once, I had great intentions but I think walking up and down the Strip is a work out enough! It was well equipped with treadmill, weights, stair master etc. Our room wasn\u2019t cleaned on one of the days of our stay which was very odd because I took the \u2018do not disturb\u2019 sign off our door when we were leaving in the morning but when we returned there was another \u2018do not disturb\u2019 sign hanging on our door and the one I took off was inside where I left it. We had a great views of most of the fireworks on the Strip from our balcony on New Years Eve. It really was amazing. The fire alarm went off new years day morning at 4am and we had to evacuate the hotel \u2013 16 floors and once we got to the bottom we were told it had been sorted.

Did I mention the balcony that's big enough for a table and four chairs. We asked for an East-facing room, because we prefer the sunrise to the Striprise. Considering that we stayed over the weekend of NASCAR, NCAA basketball, and a big grappling tournament (not to mention a couple dozen minor conventions), it was as though we had the world to ourselves. The room was very quiet and restful, even though it's a 10-minute walk from the Strip. We hiked down the street to The Flamingo one evening for a light deli meal (eating by the flamingo fountain in the garden), then rode the Monorail up and down, just because it's there. We are former locals who ignored the Monorail for 5 years, but decided to try it as tourists. Got that checked off our list. Still it was a very easy walk back from the Paris/Bally's Monorail stop to the Platinum. This time we availed ourselves of the indoor-outdoor pool (on the 5th floor), and the nicely equipped fitness center. Since we last stayed at the Platinum, we had both become gym rats, and it was great to continue our fitness habits in between eating at our Las Vegas favorites. I lost count of how many pleasant, positive encounters I had with the staff, whether calling for an extra blanket for the sofabed, or with a question about the thermostat, the response was always friendly and professional. I think I met most of the parking valet staff over the course of 3 days, and they were also unfailingly courteous and helpful. The restaurant (for Sunday morning breakfast) overlooks the pool and deck, and we found the menu to be a little limited, but perfectly adequate. Our food was very tasty, well-presented, and reasonably priced, by Las Vegas standards. Bruno, the head server, made sure everything was right, even when he was obviously very busy. If you want noise and smoke and flashing lights and staggering patrons, then you probably don't want the Platinum. If you want spacious comfort, convenience to the Strip, unfussy elegance, value-for-money, and a friendly, attentive staff, then give the Platinum a try. Maybe we'll see you there next time.", "Date": "March 14, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Anaheim, California", "Title": "\u201cLarge comfortable suite\u201d", "Author": "redwing99", "ReviewID": "UR126071694", "Content": "We spent 5 days at the Platinum.

We wanted everybody to have a bed, and to stay at a nice place without spending a fortune, and thought we had found the perfect place in The Platinum, as we got all that plus a full kitchen for $129 per room per night (Travelzoo rate). It was almost exactly what we had hoped for. Let me explain. The service at the front desk was fine. Checked in fresh off the plane at around 1pm with no problems (advertised check-in time was 4pm). Was upgraded to the bigger suites with washer/dryers in them. Non-strip view, but that was no big deal as the strip view from the pool was neat but nothing amazing. Rooms were nice, but the tube TV in the bedroom stands out like a sore thumb and the shower just would not get hot enough (this was an issue in both rooms). But those are nitpicks. No resort fees, wifi worked fine in the lobby, the beds were terrific, assortment of pillows, room temp. easy to control, blackout curtains nice for those hungover mornings, large bathroom, safe was easy to use, somebody brought us pots and pans up right away once we got up to our rooms, valet staff were really helpful, baggage storage on our last day was efficient, and they even took us someplace in their housecar (SUV) because we were going to have to call 2 cabs being a group of 6, as long as we took care of the driver with a tip, which we gladly did. The issue, and it's really the only issue, is the location. It wasn't even the walk (which is super easy- one crosswalk, then 400m to the Bally's side entrance) or the neighborhood (a couple homeless people outside the adjacent 7-11 almost every time we walked by, but they were harmless and thankful for spare change/stray can of Bud). It's that it's not right on the Strip. And yes, we knew this 100% going in, so it was not a surprise, and we were prepared for it, and I know it might seem silly to complain about it when there were numerous strip options available to us, and we picked The Platinum instead. It's just that after being in Vegas, we truly underestimated the advantages of being right on the Strip, as well as the quality of some of the so-called \"lesser\" casinos like Treasure Island, Flamingo, Luxor, Excalibur, NYNY, and some of the other lower to mid-priced options. We walked through all of those places and while they weren't The Mirage or The Wynn or The Cosmo or The Venetian, they were still way nicer than I thought they were going to be. The only room we saw was one we partied in at NYNY, and it was about on par with our at The Platinum, just smaller and without a kitchen. Yes, we would have had to pay resort fees and maybe get 3 rooms instead of 2, and we couldn't have made eggs and bacon in our room each morning, But being able to stumble down to any number of casinos/shows/restaurants from your room in less than 5 minutes would have been invaluable, for about the same amount of money. Bottom line, stay at The Platinum if you're familiar with Vegas and/or exactly where it's located. Or if you NEED a full kitchen for dietary reasons. Or if you know ABSOLUTELY that you don't need/want to stay on The Strip. Or if you're with a big budget-minded group of 3-6 people and want to split one room. Just know that none of our group would ever NOT stay on The Strip again, and that is not a strike against The Platinum. One more thing. Ellis Island Casino and Brewery is a gem. Don't miss the steak dinner special for $9.99, and if the outdoor grill is running when you're there, do that also. Half chicken/full rack of ribs/or chicken-rib combo for ~$15, with 4 sides. Awesome. The karaoke bar was full of goofy/drunk/local-Vegas energy, pus the home brews are crazy good. The hefeweisen is just about the best I've ever had. The casino is a little smoky, but they have $5 eight-deck blackjack that id dealt without a continuous shuffler, and the crew running the $5 craps table were awesome in teaching us the rules of the game as we played. So much fun- if craps intrigues you but you're intimidated about playing/learning, saddle up to Ellis Island and give it a shot. Never had so much fun gambling.

Room:- We had a Princess Suite on the 14th Floor with a Strip View and balcony which was wonderful, although as we went in February it was a bit cold to sit outside when it was dark, so we enjoyed the view from the lounge. The suite was spacious, nice furnishings, usable kitchen, a lovely bedroom with 2 big comfy beds and pillows, a lovely big bathroom and ample closet space. More than enough room for a mother and daughter. Some reviewers had mentioned that the t.v.'s weren't modern, we didn't go to Las Vegas to watch telly so it wasn't a problem for us. As we only have a snack first thing in the morning, the fitted kitchen with a toaster, microwave, over and hob was more than adequate for our needs, as was the massive fridge freezer. Facilities:- The hotel doesn't have a casino, it's completely non-smoking which is great. Coming from the UK, it was really strange to see smoking indoors in public areas and in some hotels/casinos the smoky smell is over powering. The restaurant food and staff were the same as everything else in the hotel, FANTASTIC!! as was the gym and the pool. Location:- It's proximity to the Strip meant that my mum and I walked to the Bellagio in 10 minutes, which is quicker than the time taken to exit the casino hotels on the Strip, due to casino, restaurants, and shops. Some reviews have stated that the area around the hotel wasn't great, my mum and I walked to and from the hotel day and night and never felt unsafe. Infact, I've been in scary places in the UK, any homeless folk we did see were not interested in us. Staff:- Everyone we dealt with was brilliant and they could not help you enough. When I wanted to use online booking for our flights home, the guy at the front desk did it for me and even printed out the boarding passes. Hints:- If you get a taxi from the airport, as the driver not to take the freeway, it's cheaper. If you have never gambled before, start at \"Ellis Island\" next door it's a small casino and the odds are good. Then when your ready, move onto the bigger Strip casinos.

The rooms are worn down some, the carpets need replaced and the TV's are very old (both did not bother us, but might others). The hot tub was extremely hot one day and had no heat the next day. Saying all of this we really like this hotel. I do not know if we will stay here often, but will be back. We have stayed at over 10 different hotels in Vegas and this would rate in the upper middle.

It is easy to get to the monorail stations at either Ballys or the Flamingo and there are numerous bus stops to get you most places in LV a 1 minute walk from the front of the hotel. The NO SMOKING policy of this hotel is fantastic and one which we very much appreciated. The pool area was clean and towels were abundantly available at all times. The restaurant served great food at a reasonable price, and happy hour in the bar was definitely a great place to visit. The wifi in the hotel was perfect and always available. We would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel to family and friends, and we hope to stay again in the future!!", "Date": "February 6, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cHigh rating for this hotel is not deserved\u201d", "Author": "lycheewaves", "ReviewID": "UR124209617", "Content": "Why is this hotel so high in the list of Las Vegas hotels?!

However I thought the fixtures looked a bit aged, the TV\u2019s are certainly from the dark ages! I didn\u2019t try the hot tub. Our windows faced out onto the road, not particularly nice. The room is really too big for a couple, it doesn\u2019t feel cosy because of its size and the decor is so bland and not designed to make you feel at home. Staff were ok at check-in and the valet were ok too. The walk from the Strip is a bit dodgy at night, I didn\u2019t feel safe even with my boyfriend. I didn\u2019t really like the location, even though it is close. Either stay off strip with a shuttle or stay on the Strip. However the worst thing was I left a charger in the room and came back after a trip to the Grand Canyon to see if anyone had handed it in. I rang and got put through to lost property but no one picked up the phone. Left a voicemail to be asked to be rung back but they didn\u2019t. So we went personally. Got told by unhelpful front-desk that if they didn\u2019t ring me back it meant that it wasn\u2019t there. So I said well in that case someone from Housekeeping has taken it. I asked if there was a possibility that the hadn\u2019t seen it because it was under the side table. He said it wasn\u2019t possible, it was hotel policy to check thoroughly everything, several times over. So I said well either that wasn\u2019t the case or someone had stolen it. Front desk guy didn\u2019t even want to check if someone had taken the room in between our stay. I insisted. He looked exasperated and reluctantly called the security guys. They were a little more helpful and took me back up to the room. Contrary to what the check-in guy said the room had only been basically stripped and not cleaned or cleared. I got back my charger which is great but only based on my insistence and not through any help from the staff. I didn\u2019t try the rest of the facilities but this hotel totally does not deserve such a high ranking nor the price I paid for it.

Good kitchen, big bathroom with double size jacuzzi bathtub. Would definitely come back. We've been to Las Vegas before and previously liked being on the Strip, but now that we've seen it, it was very nice to be away from it in this quiet hotel. Couple of minor niggles: - mattress ok but a bit soft for my taste - the hotel could do better on providing information. The website doesn't have much practical information, and in the room there's no ring binder type hotel manual. I guess they expect you to call reception whenever you have a question. Some practical tips: - The location is a 10-15 minute walk east of the Strip. You reach the Strip where the Bellagio/ Caesars Palace are. But the hotel is also on the inside of a bend in the Strip, so you can also walk directly north and in 20 minutes end up at the Wynn and the Fashion Mall. So the location is not bad. - Also: highly recommended: keep walking east away from the Strip from the hotel and after about 15 minutes you get to Roys restaurant which is the nr1 Las Vegas restaurant on Tripadvisor. Great cocktails at $5 between 4.30 and 6.30, and really good prix fixe dinner menu. - From the airport to the hotel you should take a taxi. I researched the buses but it's just not practical, and the monorail still doesn't run to the airport. Taxi was $16 from the airport and $11 to the airport (plus tip). - The hotel pool is on a roof terrace on the 5th floor and is nice and warm and free. - As other reviews say, there is a 7/11 next to the hotel, but that really doesn't do more than drinks and snacks. Not good for trying to stock the kitchen in your suite. But then again, don't bother: in-room breakfast service is pretty cheap and big portions (one breakfast serves two). If you do want to cook, a quick phone call to reception is needed to get pots and pans. - Wifi: conflicting notes in the various reviews as to whether it's free. Technically it's not ($10 per day), but when we arrived at the room, we got a call from reception whether everything was ok; we asked about internet and were immediately offered free wifi for the duration of our stay (you get a password). - We were on the 9th floor which was fine to get a good view and not hear too much traffic noise. But on the whole I'm not sure I would bother again paying the unmark for the strip side view. - End of January is a great time to travel to Las Vegas. We got a good deal on the room (about \u00a380 per night), and Las Vegas was pretty empty - no queues anywhere.

One TV set had a HDMI input, handy if you're traveling with a tablet supporting HDMI output. The room has no glitter, unlike some hotels on the Strip, but it's exactly this \"normal\" look, coupled with its sheer size, kitchen area and large refrigerator that makes you feel like if you were in a flat or apartment, basically in a \"home away from home\". The staff is efficient and friendly. The breakfast menu is delicious, and while they don't have an internal restaurant for a full dinner (you can have some food at the bar though), the hotel is literally a five-minute walk away from the Strip so you have hundreds of places where to have a good dinner.

Essentially a small apartment, with a complete kitchen. Full \"walk out\" balconies are a big liability problem for hoteliers, but every room in the Platinum has one - so you can actually prepare a meal in the room and eat at the table on your own terrace. - Staff service level is excellent. Your presence in the hotel is acknowledged by everybody. None of the staff ever walk by you and try to pretend that you aren't there. - The Strip is literally within sight (you can see the Bellagio fountains when they are running) but you don't have the cigarette smoke and intrusive security of a casino. If you want to sample the Strip Experience, it's an easy walk - or a short cab ride - away. - The place gets a \"4\", instead of a \"5\" because there were things - such as bathrobes - that were missing from the room that I thought should have been there.

The first day we noticed various types of hair (long and short) on the bathroom floors (we had a two bedroom suite), which we cleaned up.

We did leave generous tips to housekeeping, but noticed that certain things like vacuuming, and cleaning of counter tops, etc. were not done... or done very well. After reading many reviews on the Platinum before booking for a local trade show I was expecting a bit more. The cleanliness of our 2 bedroom suite was not good. This is one area that means A LOT to me when traveling. Although you know there were many people staying in your room before you, you don't like to see evidence of it. Overall the Platinum Hotel has a lot to offer, but this is was real weak point in our view. I do give high props to the room service quality and price. We enjoyed every meal (breakfast and dinner) that we had there. As well, the spaciousness of the suites is obviously a big selling point! The kitchen is great, but you could tell that half the glasses had been taken away or broken by prior guests, and never replenished. Walking to the AM/PM and 7-11 next door is something best done before dusk in my opinion. We encountered the homeless asking for change every time we walked over, and encountered one sitting in the bushes of the hotel. The doormen and valet are great!!!!

Requested room change which was thankfully granted. 2. Hallway smelt of vomit for 3 days. 3. Room decor is looking a little tired and didn't look like the pics on the website - are only some rooms renovated?? I would say probably 8 years old?? 4.

Walk to strip is 10 mins - drops you at Bally's or Across road from Caesars Palace. Seemed safe enough. 9. Free car valet parking is good, but does cost you a tip every time you want your car 10. Pool looks OK but didn't use it. 11. Maid service was slow, with rooms not being done until late in the day at times. 12. Complimentary internet was given to us - maybe because we booked direct with them?? 13. Rooms were reasonably clean, but could've been better in our view. 14. No casino is a positive 15.

Being a busy period it was nice to be able to get a taxi relatively quickly, enter and leave the hotel without passing through a smokey casino, and generally escape the vast crowds of people along the strip and in the major casino hotels. The kids also enjoyed the pool in the evening, while the view of the strip hotels for the fireworks at midnight on NYE was definitely a positive. However the general location is also a major negative in our opinion. Platinum isn't in the most attractive location. From the strip, the walk isn't too long (about 5-10min), but it is surrounded by vacant lots / car parks and two main roads. Although we were on the 15th floor the noise from the road was constant. Our room also overlooked the electricity sub station which wasn't overly appealling. (Tip: ask for a room directly facing the strip). Being New Year, there was a lot of activity in the hotel. While noise late into the night was expected, the fire alarm at 4.45am on new years day was not. (It also clearly came as a surprise to the night staff when people started to exit the fire stairs!).

Fitness center is open late (tend to close early at all the casino hotels...) and fitness room was huge and well equipped. Indoor-outdoor pool and hot tub - great deck to hang out on, and the whole property was wonderfully quiet. It was a quick cab ride to get to the action, and a couple of times the hotel had a car available and dropped us where we needed to be.

Arriving: we got a taxi from the airport - got driven round the freeway whilst being told how quiet everything was and takings down. $30 - so no tip. Hotel says it should be $10-$15 to the Platinum and you need to say go via Paradise Road straight to Flamingo - not the freeway. Marquis suite: was excellent. Two bedrooms/bathrooms separated by large sitting/kitchen area. Fully equipped kitchen and a washer with separate dryer in a large cupboard. And 3 views of the strip with a balcony that would be more inviting in warmer weather. Housekeeping: seemed to be having an off week when we were there. Others have noted that here. Hope that is a temporary blip or it will blight what is an excellent hotel. Fellow guests: the touring Michael Jackson Cirque du Soleil cast and crew were staying at the Platinum while it was playing at the Mandalay - it would be a good place - quieter but still close to the Strip. Dining: We arrived late so had room service first night. It was surprisingly good in terms of quality and price. Above average for room service. Breakfast - again more of the same and the staff were really great. You can get a Platinum breakfast, which will be far more than you can eat, for $11. Less gigantic dishes also available... Walking: we walked back and forth a bit - there is a reduced price tickets place just on the right where E Flamingo meets the Strip - as you have to be there early (9:30) to get the best choice of the day's tickets, it's good to know it's less than 15 minutes away. We wouldn't really recommend walking around on your own anywhere much but there were 3 of us and we never felt uncomfortable. There were some homeless people around but they seemed to be pretty absorbed in their own difficulties. Anyway, once you've walked past the Westin on the other side of the road you can turn into the side road of Ballys and then into Ballys and out onto the Strip if you want to. We only did to get out of the evening cold. You can also walk down Koval and up East Harmon to get to the Aria/MGM end of town though probably only in daylight. It does avoid the piped music, which does get a bit spooky after a while. The Strip: Fantastic lights, Bellagio Fountains, MGM Lions, The Venetian and Caesars Palace all worth seeing. Definitely take in a show and if you can stand the smell of stale cigarettes overlaid with carpet shampoo then a stroll through the casino area of any of the main hotels is great. The Fashion Show mall is huge - just down from TI - with a Macys, Nordstrom, Neiman Marcus etc. Our absolute favourite thing was the Antiquarian Book store - Bauman Rare Books The Shoppes at the Palazzo - probably because it was so unexpected and they had some extraordinary books. One thing you probably already know but in case not... the sex trade is very present, in the form of magazines, advertising material and people trying to push flyers at you every 2 minutes or so.

We visited just after-Thanksgiving, and changed our planned one-night visit into three nights. A sanctuary of relative peace in the middle of the Vegas bustle. For contrast, I'll tell you about a night at a different hotel on our recent visit. First night: Stayed at a famous old casino, recently renovated, with a discounted room through their reservation service. It was mediocre service, bored employees, crowded elevators, long walks to parking, no view, broken vending and ice machines on multiple floors, hair other than ours in the bathroom, and redish-brown paint stains on the room carpet and furniture. Not a terrible facility, just barely mediocre. 'Express Check-out' box caused a $50 'late checkout surcharge' because the box was emptied after the11am checkout time. Overall experience: underwhelming mediocrity and poor value. Days 2-5: The Platinum Hotel and Spa(ahhh!) Parking: The valet opened my companions door, was cordial, professional, (and handled our luggage personally all the way up to our room.) He familiarized us with the valet service, basic hotel policies, and operations. After taking luggage to our room, he made sure we had everything that we needed, offered us extra towels, and had the cookware delivered. There was no valet charge mentioned, so I gladly tipped $10 for his positive attitude, good service, and attention to our needs. Check-in: 10pm was very smooth with only one other customer ahead of us. We were seated by the valet attendant in a small plush lounge, with comfortable sofa and chairs for the short 2-5 minute wait. A polite and efficient young gentleman handled our check-in. While working on our check-in he asked about the purpose for our stay, and then made some great recommendations on everything from food, shopping, and even general questions about Vegas. He answered some questions with an honest, 'I don't know, but will find out,' and then actually followed-up the next day! When he found out that we might stay for three nights instead of one, he asked my permission to change our room so that we wouldn't need to change later. He then apparently upgraded us to a better (princess?) suite with view at no charge! There were no sob stories needed, no $20 tip-sandwiches, nor a request was needed for that level of attention. Tipping for this level service is a pleasure. The Room: A Full Princess suite, clean, quiet, Kitchen with polished appliances, stove, full-size fridge with in-door ice and water, full smooth-top range, microwave, dishwasher, shiny clean stone counter tops. Laundry room with clean washer, dryer, iron and ironing board, laundry soap, etc. Living Room with balcony, big (sleeper?) sofa, chairs, electric fireplace, massive flat screen TV, balcony with table and chairs, and even a decent view. Bedroom:Two plush queen beds, soft clean sheets, big-screen tv in bedroom, closet with in-room laptop safe. Lots of room, plenty of lighting, and a window with a decent view. Bathroom was very clean, big deep multi-person spa tub with jets, large shower, double sinks, stone vanity, extra mirrors, hair dryer, large closet, nice tile floors and windows. Very nice, very clean. Late check-out and later housekeeping service was offered to us due to our late arrivals. This allowed us to sleep late in the mornings, with no pounding on the door by housekeeping...nice touch. A cooler of chilled water with real fruit and large cups were available in the lobby. It really helped us adjust to the dry climate and was welcome after walking the strip. There was a nicely appointed cocktail lounge off of the lobby, with music at a level that allowed relaxed conversation. We didn't try the food service, but the wings (I think) smelled great. Each trip we made out and back via car was painless due to the quick valet service. The staff even spoke to us by name after the second day, which was a nice touch. Internet service was quick, television reception was clear, and there was a good selection of free programming. The desk/operator answered the phones within three rings the few times we called. All in all, this was a very comfortable, quiet, quality stay within a block of center-strip hustle and bustle. Check out Google maps for just how close it is to places like the Bellagio and Bill's. The Platinum is an excellent value based on our experience. During our stay the suites were discounted to under $150/night, which I consider a steal given the level of service and location. There are a number of places to eat reasonably nearby, reasonable Italian, and even a new excellent Fogo de Chao all-you-can-eat Brazillian Steak house just down the block. Check it out for a great lunch that will stay with you until the next day! But with a full kitchen available, it's really convenient to eat cheap when you want in your suite.

Besides the normal amenities, the rooms are remarkably well appointed -- plates, flatware, glasses, cooking utensils, paper towels, dish washing and laundry soap. They had large closets and a double whirlpool tub. Our room was spotlessly cleaned everyday. The staff at the hotel was great. Valet service was prompt (thanks Donn). The Spa was very welcoming (thanks Tina). While the Spa has a $5 charge it you don't have a spa service, it is well worth this modest charge. Though the hotel was a short distance from the strip, we had a car and would park in the hotel garages on the strip (free). This was quick and convenient.

The restaurant staff were awesome!!!! And the food was first rate... One evening after a long trip to the Grand Canyon Skywalk we ordered room service and it was very prompt and reasonably priced. The young lady who delivered our meal took time out to chat and recommend things to see and do. We mentioned to her that we were going to see Garth Brooks at the Wynn and a few days later we met her on the elevator and she asked us aid we enjoyed Garth....we were very impressed that she remembered us.

The bedroom was approximatey 21 x 12. It had a t.v. (not flat panel), lounge chair, 1 drawer and shelf nightstand, one lamp between the beds (not great lighting), 4 pillows per bed, lamp by the lounge chair, sofa, 3 drawer dresser, closet with safe. The bathroom amenities included shampoo, conditioner and body lotion as well as a magnifying mirror (unlit). There are two sinks in a nice pullman. You will enjoy a separate shower with an excellent shower head as well as a jacuzzi tub for two. Water pressure was good. The bathroom is large (18 x 9 approx) with a full length mirror. Towels are stiff and not luxurious.....but plenty provided....4 bath and 4 hand. We did not receive night service. A substitute product for Kleenix was anything but satisfactory. The bathroom was clean and had marble throughout. The living room was 20 x 13 with a 13 x 9 kitchen. In the living room there was a couch, coffee table, lounge chair, end table with lamp, desk and desk lamp with chair. There is a flat screen t.v. with a wide range of available chanels. The kitchen had a s.s. refrigerator that includes a freezer (side by side). There are 4 bar stools, lots of counter space, toaster, microwave, oven and a varied assortment of utensils and and dishware. Certainly enough to get by. Of course there is a wine opener and and ice bucket. Maid service was good. So this is not a luxury hotel.....no gambling.....no shops.....but a nice coffee shop and cocktail lounge. We went here for value and the comfort of a suite and were not sorry. It was a good experience and we would return. If you want a luxury feel, head to the Wynn, Mandarin or Four Seasons.....If you want comfort and want to save a few bucks I think you will enjoy the Platinum. It compares with The Hotel in comfort although The Hotel might have a slight upsmanship in class.", "Date": "November 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne, Australia", "Title": "\u201cSuperb hotel offers a fantastic value for money and is only minutes walk away from the Strip\u201d", "Author": "andytseng", "ReviewID": "UR120603781", "Content": "My fianc\u00e9e and I was in Vegas for 3 nights as part of our California trip.

We stayed in the \"Solitaire Suite with a Strip View\" and it was located on the top-most floor (17th). The room is massive, clean and tidy, and the view from our balcony (especially at night) was just beautiful. The Jacuzzi in our bathroom (again, a huge bathroom) is superb and we used it every night when we were there - a nice way to wash away a day of tiredness. We didn't spend too much time by the pool (but it looks really nice) as we had a busy schedule but we did have breakfast in the Kil@wat Restaurant 3 times and it was a always wonderful experience every time we were there. The duty manager and staffs there (in particular a lady originated from Florida, can't recall her name) were extremely friendly and helpful, and offered some great conversations - you cannot beat that to start the day!! ;-) The hotel is only a 10mins walk away to the Bellagio Hotel (where we saw the 'O' - cirque du soleil, a must see if you are ever in LV, we saw 'KA' one as well but 'O' is clearly the BEST!!) which is in the middle of the Strip, perfect for exploring/walking to either side of the Strip. We had no problem in walking home at nights as we felt very safe there. The cab is a short ride away and will cost you something like $7 (inc. tip) from Bellagio Hotel if you don't want to walk. The Platinum Hotel and Spa may not have the glamour exterior design (though I like it) than some of the more established hotels in LV but it is certainly one of the best hotel you can find there in Vegas.

I could have brought my entire family with the space that I had in this room. Washer/Dryer(there was also detergent and softener provided), stove, microwave, fridge this room had everything one could need other than the groceries. The kitchen also included glassware, plates, bowls, silverware, and some cooking utensils. Dishwashing detergent for hand washing and the dishwasher was also provided as well as a scrubby pad for cleaning dishes. The pull out bed from the sofa is a little thin and you will need to contact the front desk for bedding for it but it was still much more comfortable than expected. Pillows fluffy..bedding clean and an extra roll of toilet paper in the bathroom closet. The jacuzzi tub also functioned correctly...great after walking all day. Took the stairs down from the 14th floor...the staircase is well lit all the way down. I did not hear a bit of noise that wasn't being made by the TV the entire visit. I was amazed!! Stir happy hour includes the tapas menu so everything is 1/2 price from 4-8pm which is awesome if you want a quick snack before heading out to the vegas strip. I can vouch for the spicy bloody mary..mmmmm. The fitness center has new equipment and opens at 5am. It was very clean and they provided towels and a water cooler. They had both weights/strength training and cardio equipment. Would have like to have seen a spin bike versus your standard recumbant but I can't have everything. The pool is gorgeous and the view is even better! Front desk included 2 mounted I-pads so that you can print you boarding passes for the airport right there!! Wireless internet worked well in my suite even for a webinar I had to attend the 2nd night I was there. There is climate control in the room and to activate it for your own personal settings you must insert your room key directly by the light switch in the kitchen. The thermostat was next to the fireplace. I run a little cold so it was nice to be able to increase the temperature in the room to my liking. There are 3 convenience stores within a block including a 7 eleven and a am/pm. At night, vegas is gorgeous from any side of the hotel due to all the lights in the city. It is a short walk to the strip ~3-6 normal blocks so make sure you have comfortable shoes unless you utilize a cab the entire time you are here. Bought a 3 day pass for the bus which runs 24/7 up and down the strip for $20.

For this trip we got an excellent deal through Snique Away at the Platinum Hotel and decided to give it a try. On arrival - a short cab ride from the airport - we were told that our room was not ready but would be in 15 minutes. I was a little surprised because it was 3 PM when we arrived but we went and sat in an area just off the lobby and waited. After 10 minutes the front desk clerk told us the room was ready, apologized for the wait and offered free internet connectivity from our room for the duration of our stay. I thought this was a great way to start off our stay at Platinum. The room was large - kitchen, living room, bedroom, bathroom with jacuzzi tub and separate shower stall. Very nice and clean and very quiet despite being on the 2nd floor overlooking Flamingo Road which is quite busy. The kitchen was well equipped and we took advantage of having the kitchen for breakfast in the morning. There are a couple of convenience stores close by or you could walk 2 kms along Flamingo to Albertson Supermarket or Target. There is no \"WOW\" factor to the rooms like at many of the strip hotels but for the price it was a good room. The hotel offers a pool, fitness centre and spa - we did not use any of these facilities. They also have a happy hour from 5 PM to 8 PM daily in the Stir Lounge. Minuses - though I didn't think two blocks from the strip was a big deal, it is at night when you are walking back to your hotel after a long Vegas day. Housekeeping did not put bathrobes in the room and never replenished the coffee/creamer supplies. We had to ask for bathrobes and coffee supplies at the front desk. These were quickly delivered but I don't think we should have to ask every day for coffee. The front desk and door staff are very friendly and helpful.

We selected this hotel after reading several reviews from past guests. When we arrived we were greeted by the parking attendant who offered their assistance with true interest and not the -- I want a tip attitude. FYI, self parking is not an option at the Platinum and quite frankly for a couple of bucks here and there, well worth it. Checking in was a breeze with the same \"how can we help your stay more enjoyable\" attitude from the staff behind the counter. This theme by hotel staff carried on throughout our stay. Our reservations placed us on the 9th floor looking towards the strip. The view from our room was OK at best because you are looking out over an old large vacant parking lot and towards the back of the casinos on the strip. At night the view was much better due to the lights. Opening our room door, you enter into the kitchen which is a full kitchen to include, fridge, stove, dishwasher, plates, glasses, etc... What was not in the room but we soon requested were pots and pans. We choose to make breakfast in the AM when we got up. A bit different having a full kitchen with no cook ware, but no biggie we just called down and they gleefully sent up anything we needed. It also includes things like dish washing soap, sponge, etc... The kitchen counter was granite and it separated the kitchen from the living room. The living room was also quite large which included a large flat screen TV with a sleeper sofa couch, coffee table, etc... There is a sliding door leading to the balcony that looks towards the strip that has a table and a few chairs for sitting. Located in a separate closet off of the kitchen/living room are the clothes washer and dryer . It too includes the all the necessities needed for washing your clothes. The little things like no need to get soap, sponges, detergent, fabric softener, etc... speaks volumes in being a customer service oriented facility. I say facility versus hotel because from what I gather, some units are owned by permanent residents and others are rented like you would experience in a typical hotel encounter. Enough of that, back to the details. Off of the living room is a door leading to the bedroom. The bedroom is very spacious and the bed was very comfortable. Not some cheesy worn out mattress but a seemingly new firm mattress. There are the typical night stands, lights, clock radio, and chairs adjacent to the bed. The bedroom has a clothes closet with a safety deposit box. We didn't use it but it's there for your convenience. There's a large window that also overlooks towards the strip. Off of the bedroom is the bathroom that comes with a large tiled shower, a large Jacuzzi tub for two, a double bowl sink, and another clothes closet that has its own hangers. There are two doors into the bathroom, one from the bedroom and another off of the kitchen. The hotel has a inviting restaurant/bar on the first floor that was warm and comfortable. We ordered drinks and had a few appetizers only once during our stay. The drinks were fine but we did complain about the shrimp ceviche they offer. I'm a bit picky on ceviche so if you are you too, you'll be disappointed. To their credit they were apologetic and immediately took it off our bar tab. Located on the fifth floor is an indoor/outdoor pool with a medium sized outdoor hot tub adjacent to the outside portion of the pool. The temperature in November was in the upper 50's/60's. The pool has its own towels so there is no need to bring one from your room. There is no life guard on duty so be cautious with little children. There is plenty of comfortable seating available. The temperature of the water was very relaxing and I'm not a cold water lover so you gauge. All in all I would highly recommend this place and return again. Keep in mind this is a NON-gambling hotel so if that is what you want you'll need to walk/drive to the strip for that or find another place to stay. The hotel is located on Flamingo Rd. and the walk to Las Vegas Blvd. takes about 5 min. From there your right smack dab in the middle of things. Now for the bad. The view from our room was OK. There weren't enough towels in the room. There were three sets. I never asked for more but I'm sure based on past experiences they would gladly provide more. That's it..... p.s.

At check in we had a small issue but the front desk was quick to resolve that issue. Once we checked into our room we had encountered a couple housekeeping issues.

Once I showed them the issues they informed us they would send someone up to fix it. When we returned from dinner my husband and I found a bottle of sparkling wine for our anniversary which was nice and noticed that housekeeping had come by and fixed the issues.

I had told her that my husband was in the shower and if she could come back after an hour it would be appreciated. However she never did. When we came back to our room nothing was done. I called the front desk and unfortunately at 9pm there is no housekeeping service but we did get new towels. Apparently the exact same thing happened to our friends staying next door. Not a big deal but a little disappointed in housekeeping at this location. Although I had encountered issues at check in and with housekeeping, I would probably come back depending on price.

The Platinum is one block from The Strip, about a 10-15 minute walk from Bally's and The Bellagio. (The blocks are very long in Vegas). The small lobby has a chic, night club feel to it. This is a non-gaming hotel, so there is no noisy, smokey casino floor to walk through. Whew! We had a pleasant check in. We had room 302, probably not the best room in the hotel due to the low floor, and it was right across from the elevators. However, I did not hear one single peep from inside the hotel during the entire stay - not the elevators, not a door slamming, no one walking through the halls. There was some minimal traffic noise at night, which was easily taken care of by earplugs since I am sensitive to noise while sleeping. The room was a solitaire suite with two double beds, strip view. The beds were pretty good but had a bit of a trough down the middles. Four pillows of nice fluffiness per bed. The room was huge and very comfortable, with a full kitchen and palatial bathroom. There is a separate living room and two TVs. The bathroom included a large jet tub, and I spent a wonderful hour sipping wine in there on Saturday night. There was also a separate shower. No bathrobes but apparently you can request them at no charge. Nice shampoo and soap. We ordered room service twice and it was prompt and mostly tasty, but the chicken soup and the sea bass were way over-salted. Some drawbacks that prevented me rating this hotel 5 stars: -horrible coffee, in the room and in the restaurant. Cappuccino was okay, but the regular coffee tasted like soil. -poor wine selection. Kind of like cheapy stuff that they jacked up the price on. Particularly the chardonnay. The pinot noir (not on the menu) was better. -continental breakfast was pretty lackluster -way too much chlorine in the hot tub. Our eyes were stinging within minutes. I rushed my daughter back to the room for a shower so we didn't get a rash from it. -surly check out lady (Ginger, I think). Overall, though, it was a very nice hotel.

I like to tip, but that got annoying when I had to run some errands and tip 6 or 7 times a day after waiting 15 minutes to get my car. They need to make this valet-optional. In the middle of the afternoon there was only one poor valet guy parking cars and retrieving cars so, needless to say, I was pretty pissed off when I couldn't get to my car quickly.

The whirlpool bath was lovely until I turned the whirlpool part on and a load of green gunge spluttered out. Yuk.

The only thing I would suggest here is a better place for potty for dogs. There is a gated area by the valeted cars but it only has astro turf (which ended up making my dog's feet green and covered in turf) and she would just jump up onto the rocks to pee. Not sure if a sodded area would be a solution?? Like I said, I know there aren't many people who bring their dogs and there isn't much grass period in Vegas, but something natural might be nice. The distance from the strip wasn't a problem for us. Bally's is right there and they have a monorail stop for $5 a ride or $12 for a 24 hour period, so if you work it right, you can make it work.

I had booked for a high floor quiet room and strip view (a more pricier option) and I got a middle floor with a roof and an air conditioning unit right outside my balcony. I did try to change but the staff over two days could not find me a suitable room. In the end I gave up and lived with it. Also once again although the housekeeping staff were so sweet and friendly the room on the surface looked clean but it was not...on arrival even the dishwasher had not been cleaned or emptied and still had the last persons china in it!! I ran and then emptied it. The cutlery drawer was also pretty yukky! I had to request my bath be cleaned after the first few days (the bath is huge by the way with fabulous jacuzzi bubbles if you so require) and it did not get cleaned again the rest of my vacation. Nor did the room get hoovered for the last four either...I know because I was up late the last four days and so was there when housekeeping attended. I gave up requesting things be cleaned by then! I had also previously requested also the kitchen tops be cleaned as they weren't touched either. There was thick dust around the furniture at the bases, on the lamp and telephone leads and even on the table tops. They turned my room around in a max of 5-8 minutes a day when I was there and the suites are huge so it was just a case of replenishing stuff and not much cleaning as you can imagine. On the \"in room service\" I did order a couple of times and the food was good but on one occasion the food was barely warm. Be aware of the extra delivery and service charge they add as that can really hike it up.Also it would be nice to have service by the pool for at least drinks but I never saw anyone. Failing those faults the hotel staff do a lot to make up for it. I have never met such pleasant staff....If you request an item they always follow up with a phone call to check you have received the items. They took exceedingly good care of my car which I was nervous about leaving anywhere having just had it scraped at another hotel in LA. The hotel room does have everything you need and if you do get a strip view room you get a washer/dryer which was a godsend....going back home all washing done a real plus after a month away. I did not find the distance to the Strip a problem because I used my car but I think you would definitely need a taxi to and fro otherwise as there's not just the walk to and from the hotel but the strip also and that can be very tiring having walked all the casinos or other attractions. Whether I stay here again I don't know as I was expecting just a bit more for the price I paid...there are other non casino hotels offering as much for cheaper but I went for this one as at the time it was #1 on trip advisor and I see it is now #3.

The week earlier we had had a one night stay at the Golden Nugget on Freemont Street which was ok for a Vegas hotel but it did have that amazing light show just outside. If you haven't seen that you need to. It has all of the excess that Las Vegas has to offer without the continual hassle associated with moving up and down The Strip. Anyway, I digress. The Platinum is just 2 blocks from The Srip at Ceasar's Palace and so it is well situated for geting to the main action, but as I say, misses out on the \"the vibe\" which was disappointing for the 2 days that we were in Vegas but probably a God send if your visit is for longer than that. Hey, we've all got to sleep sometime. Facilities and service I really cannot fault. Polite, efficient, friendly, what more could you ask? The room came with a huge bathroom and I mean huge, a fully fitted kitchen with breakfast counter in granite, a good sized lounge and a balcony from which we could see most of The Strip. There is a good sized swimming pool sheltered from any wind and a good supply of sunbeds and towels. Also, just to make the break from The Strip complete, there is no cassino. Yippie! On the next block heading for The Strip there is a very nice and handy shopping walkway that gives a number of options onto the main street including through the Paris Hotel. It's pleasant and even if you don't like shopping it's good to walk through. That means it is not very far away from the Bellagio and they have, without any doubt, the best \"all you can eat\" buffets in the city. Whatever time you go there will be a queu. Be patient. They'll get you in and it will be worth it. All in all, I would without hesitation reccommend this hotel to anyone looking to stay in Vegas for a while just on price but for 2 days?

This was our 4th time in Vegas, but first in an off-strip hotel....and we loved it! Although we are both gamblers, it was a treat to be able to walk out of the casino, walk back to the hotel and have peace and quiet. We didnt find the walk to the hotel at all hard work and we never felt threatened, even walking back in the small hours....we encountered the odd homeless person, but they were nothing but polite and we encountered more on the bridges over the strip. We stayed in a princess suite, which was huge. It was clean and comfortable (especially the bed) and whenever we requested anything from housekeeping it was with us within 10 minutes (now you dont get that on the strip!!) We ate breakfast at the hotel a couple of times and it was good and convenient, but we also went to Tuscany Suites more or less next door and ate at Marilyn's cafe which was also very good (and slightly cheaper). The pool area is lovely and reasonably quiet even on a weekend, with everything you need on hand. We also used the spa, which was great and the prices were so much cheaper that anything you would find on the strip. All in all, this is an excellent hotel with fantastic staff who are attentive but not intrusive. In my opinion the short distance of strip is a pro not a con....in my experience you can walk further thru a casino and along a hotel corridor to get to your room than we did to get to the action....

We proceeded to check in which was very smooth and directed to our room. We were welcomed by a full kitchen area, full lounge area, massive bathroom and super king size bed and balcony with a wonderful view of the strip. Bliss for weary travellers!! We thoroughly enjoyed the double size spa bath and huge shower, large comfortable bed and the views of the entire strip. We even had a view (albeit small) of the Bellagio fountains in the evenings from our balcony. Everything was comfortable, clean and well maintained. The pool area was great too with indoor and outdoor areas and lots of room for sunbathers on large padded sunbeds. There are towels for guests to use down by the pool so no need to bring them from your room. This hotel is non-smoking and non-gambling but after being in a few of the casinos this is a welcome haven to come back to.

Food in Vegas is expensive!! The walk from the strip to the hotel is around half a mile so not worth doing by anyone with walking difficulties. The valets will flag down a taxi for you from the front of the hotel if this is required. If you do take the walk then you will come out right in the middle of the strip between the Flamingo hotel and Bally\u2019s which is directly opposite the Bellagio and Caesars Palace and right in the middle of everything.

Perfect for families, there will be no problem for you and your kids to stay with comfort.

You are not that far off the strip, but far enough that it can become dodgy at night to walk all the way out there (especially if the ladies are planing on putting those stilettos they haven't dared wearing since they bought them some years ago). So you have to use taxis, and without a cab rank, it takes forever, even if ordered by the receptionists. If you are on your way to a show, make sure you are organised. The same for security. No need to have a hotel room card to access the floors, you can just walk in. I never felt threatened, but you never know, especially as a women or with young kids. The views are terrible, giving you a direct access to the car park, boulevard and other empty land sections that surround the place. One pro, is the 7/11 and petrol station around the corner, if you forgot the bread or if the room service stopped serving (at 11PM). A con, the business centre is really bad and forget about printing the last minute presentation. The board room is nice and well organised but pricey. Business in there, only if you have to.

I won't repeat the very well described, well deserved, extremely accurate descriptions below, because I agree with all of them. The Platinum is exactly what we were looking for, and it is exactly what we got -- with several very pleasant and unexpected surprises. I'm also going to include an invaluable \"tip\" for those of you reading this review and others who've mentioned the distance to the strip. Yes, it is a bit of a walk. We're seniors, we walked it only once to get to the closest self-serve ticket-wicket (around Planet Hollywood). The City runs an exceptional public transit system. A 3-day, unlimited use pass costs a mere $20 per person. With this pass you can ride the DEUCE up and down the entire strip PLUS it gives you access to the ENTIRE bus system throughout the city. What can be better, cheaper, faster? Bus No. 202, which runs along Flamingo Drive runs every 15 minutes on the quarter hour (like clock work!!). The stop to use to get to the Strip is in front of the Westin Hotel; the stop coming back to the hotel is not 50 yards from the hotel's driveway. And from the Strip, the bus stop faces Bill's Gambling Casino (just steps past the elevator structure from the pedestrian walk-way off the strip). Unlike other reviewers, we saw neither \"vagrants\" nor \"ladies of the night\" around or close to the Platinum. We ate at the Kil@Wat restaurant following our check-in. Although the service was very slow (probably because it was 2:30) the food was delicious. We also took advantage of the Happy Hour at the Stir Lounge. Like everything foodie in Las Vegas, the tapas portions were HUGE. My husband and I each ordered 2 items from the extensive menu. We couldn't finish it all. Hubby had a shrimp cocktail (huge, fresh shrimp), some 6 shrimp and chicken wings. He thought being tapas, he'd get 5 or 6 wings -- nope, a dozen. I ordered bruschetta and veggie spring rolls -- got 3 beautiful and very tasty bruschetta and 7 spring rolls. I managed to eat the bruschetta but only 2 spring rolls. Tapas? In Canada you'd get 1 piece of French bread cut into 4, and 2 or 3 spring rolls. The drinks were also half price. All in all, take advantage of the Happy Hour .... after a long day's walking, we didn't much feel like going to the Strip again to eat. I do want to mention the outstanding front desk staff, especially Nathan Rex, the housekeeping staff, the engineers (who fixed the washer connection and the spout in the jacuzzi tub) and of course the valet/doormen. No sooner did my husband call down to report the problem, within 5 minutes (honestly) a knock on the door, an introduction, an apology for having disturbed us, the engineer went about his task; explaining what he found broken, what he would do, and the time frame in which he would complete the task. A phone call some 10 minutes after the task was completed, asking if the job had been done to our satisfaction. Our last night we called down for clean wash cloths because we opted not to have the room \"done\" (I'm anal about making the beds and tidying up myself), housekeeping was knocking on our door within 3 - 5 minutes. Ten minutes later the phone rang asking whether the wash cloths had been received. Another call about 5 minutes after, again, asking whether the wash cloths had been received. Service ...... no competition Wynn, Ceasar's, Bellagio; take a lesson from the Platinum. Oh and about 4 hours after having checked in, a knock on the door; the management and staff had sent up a bottle of champagne and a platter of chocolate covered strawberries along with a congratulatory anniversary card!!

The lobby was pretty dark and small, but functional. They had one small bar next to the lobby, but I never saw anyone in it. I assume everyone was like us and walked to the strip for actual \"stuff\". But the first floor really was the _worst_ part of the hotel (and, really, not so bad (just dark - lots of dark wood - what's up with THAT?)). The room hallways were nice, simple but nice. The rooms were nice - _almost_ classy. Tile/stone floors and walls in the bathroom, giant separate tubs, REALLY lots of room in the \"lower end\" suite we stayed in. The only negative I can think of for the room was there was only a single, small dresser. But they you have two decent size closets too, so really not the end of the world (VERY minor negative). The pool area is even nicer than the pictures on their site let on. Not sure what the drink prices were on the pool deck, as that would kind of spoil things if they rake you over on that. A small restaurant right next to the pool. Also, the pool area was on the 5th floor, so you're very removed from the street. Nice little \"oasis\" if you're looking for a place to quiet down from the strip. It wasn't as glamorous as the Palazzo or anything, but certainly nice you you just want someplace to hang. The gym was HUGE compared to most hotels with some VERY good equipment. You could easily get a decent workout here (most hotels you're really having to compromise the workout as the size/equipment is so limited - just simply not an issue here). The room was super clean. The kitchen was almost bigger than the one I have at home! They aren't kidding that it's a FULL kitchen. however, absolutely no food (not even ketchup) so it's pretty limited as to what you're going to actually cook. Unless you're driving and bringing a bunch of condiments/spices and everything else, the kitchen is not going to be much good. Honestly, they could have just left the kitchen out entirely and the room would still be great. We paid under $200 and that was a steal. This hotel on the strip would be worth a lot more... As for going to the strip, WALK you will. While it's really only one block off strip, it's a B_I_G L_O_N_G B_L_O_C_K with nothing but the backside of Bally's (and front of Westin...?) and a grimy parking lot. It would have been pretty sketchy but there were very few people along the way (only one couple begging for money! ( the pedestrian walkways were worse ;) ) It's well lit, but you might consider taking a taxi just because it is one BORING walk... Especially compared to the total sensory overload of the strip. So... Nice rooms, great pool area and gym, not really all that \"glamorous\", but more than adequate unless you're trying to show off. All non-smoking and no casino (yeah!).

We arrived around 11 pm and check-in was handled extremely efficiently - 5 minutes total from walking into reception. Our room was on the 16th floor and we'd chosen a strip-view Solitaire Suite; again, first impressions were positive with plenty of space, immaculately appointed kitchen area, adequate storage and a large, very comfortable bed. Larger rooms are available but if you're travelling as a couple, the Solitaire should be plenty big enough - the only advantage I can see for the upgraded Princess Suite is that it comes equipped with a washer/dryer. The bathroom, whilst large and nicely appointed, was starting to show its age and a couple of the door frames had started to rot at the bottom, but otherwise no issues with the room at all. The only slightly disappointing aspect was the 'strip view'. You can certainly see the strip from the 16th floor but you are effectively looking at the back of the Paris, Planet Hollywood and Bally's. Is the additional premium for a strip view worth it? Maybe from a higher floor, but if a strip view is important and you're prepared to pay for it, know that it will be a distant strip view and ask for a room on as high a floor is available (elevators are quick and there was never a queue for the 4 nights of our visit). We only ate in the hotel once, which was breakfast, and whilst it was probably slightly pricey by Vegas standards, the quality could not be faulted. Special mention also to the table staff (sorry, can't remember their names) who were excellent. The Platinum was a compromise choice as my wife and I travelled with her parents who are non-smokers and do not gamble. The hotel is only one block from the strip but one block in Vegas is quite a trek and if the casinos are your primary reason for visiting, consider carefully. Also, being off the strip, The Platinum will not have a steady stream of taxis waiting outside reception. That said, the guys at the front door do a great job at hailing cabs from the street and I don't think we waited more than 5 minutes on any occasion - in fact, twice they arranged for the hotal car to take us to the strip which was greatly appreciated, thanks guys.

We were allocated suite number 1415 on the 14th floor. The suite was a good size with a full kitchen including a fridge and ice making machine and a strip view which was very impressive. The bathroom was very spacious and had a door from the bedroom and also the main living area and had a double jacuzzi bath and separate walk-in shower along with 2-sinks, a large selection of towels and toiletries. The suite was very clean and the towels were changed daily. In the evening - we could see the Bellagio fountain display through a gap between buildings! The bed was the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in, as were the pillows which is often not the case in hotels. There were a number of extras like a full size ironing board with new iron and a hairdryer with long cable which was not permanently fixed in the bathroom (a big plus). There was also a kettle for use on the hob. At night the room was very quiet and had black-out curtains to ensure a good nights sleep - the only noise was a very slight rattling on occasion from the air con unit.

First of all we do an event in Vegas every year or so and it is always a challenge. Land in the heart of the strip and attentions wander, too far from the strip and you have rooms full of pouting professionals. The location cannot be beat, right next to Bally's and a quick walk anywhere you need to be. As far as the event itself, the attention that the staff gave the members of our group was nothing short of amazing. Marie Quinby runs a fantastic events team. No request seemed to be too big or too small. However, they were so detail oriented that we did not have much left to request, and I will readily admit we can be pretty high maintenance. Lauren Simms and Alejandra Ramirez ran our day to day coverage for meals, snacks, etc. and never missed a beat. More importantly they made it a point to quickly learn the needs and likes of each participant and quickly had things ready and waiting for everyone before they could ask. Truly a great team! Now as for the hotel itself... Prepare for the biggest bang for your business buck ever. When we do these conventions I expect a Marriott style room (and there is nothing wrong with that), but was greeted with something out of the Hangover for the same price. For the same price as an average room in any other city I had a full kitchen with granite countertops, a washer and drier, a fireplace, a balcony, a bathroom the size of a small apartment, and a king size bed that rivaled any of the high dollar chains for comfort. Additionally, they have a great lounge downstairs with very reasonable prices and a happy hour from 4-8 that was a great way to unwind at the end of the day. As you can tell, I became a huge fan, and WILL go back for business and even vacations any time I go to Vegas. This place is can't miss, but the main reason was the people.

The hotel restaurant is chic, the food delicious and handsomely presented, and the servers efficient and genial, and in-room dining, of which we did plenty, proved to be of extraordinary high quality. An added bonus is being able to enjoy a stunning view of the Strip (just ask for a room with a Strip view) without suffering the noise and hurly burly of a hotel right on that busy thoroughfare. The Platinum is an easy walk--it took us about twelve minutes and we don't speedwalk--from the Strip itself and the monorail is just as close. We do a great deal of traveling, both in and out of country, and thus have tasted the fare of many, many hotels: the Platinum ranks right at the top.

I read the reviews on TA and thought this hotel would be great. There are a few things that spoiled our stay. Check-in was smooth and by all accounts pleasant. They upgraded us to the bigger Princess suite which was a nice bonus. The suite itself is nicely furnished and is large enough for a family of 4 to spread out. It was a nice suite except for a couple issues.The suite smelled of mould! After looking around, I figured the smell was coming from the bathroom. The tiles didn't seem like they were cleaned properly-the shower was the worst. I don't think it drained properly. I was equally turned off when I saw the huge jetted tub missing jet nozzles and other pieces to it. It's such a shame other guests would abuse the furnishings. It would have been nice to try it out. I appreciated having two queen beds but the mattresses were in poor shape. They were not comfortable at all and were very cheap. To top off my gripes with the bed, the linens were extremely poor quality and smelled dirty. I'm not convinced they were changed from the last guests. What does poor quality mean? I wore black pyjamas which by morning were covered in lint. They were certainly not high thread count bedding you'd see in such a beautiful and first-class hotel. On another note, this hotel has a valet service only. We are not used to this service and my biggest fear would be something would happen to the car rental. Well, on day 2 when our car was brought up, there were two dents with paint removed off the rear passenger door that were not there the day before. My husband being the non-controversial type didn't mention it to the driver. I realize car rentals might be seen as not a big deal but to me I would treat this car like my own. It made me angry. Here's where it gets more interesting. The pool area has potential to be a great spot to relax and swim. It's on the 5th floor and overlooks the strip. The indoor section of the pool is nice especially when it's extremely hot outside. Unfortunately, I found a cigarette butt on the pool deck. This hotel is suppose to be non-smoking so how could that be? I think the worst part of the pool is the fact it looked extremely dirty. We planned to swim and there were others in the pool but the water was cloudy. Other guests were commenting about the cloudiness too. I don't think this is normal, nor did it seem normal that there was little chlorine smell. Anyway, my little one developed itchy eyes after the first swim. After her second swim the day after, her eyes were extremely red, very painful which made for a miserable evening. She developed an ear infection as well! The in-room washer and dryer were nice and I did a couple loads of laundry. Not sure whether it was the detergent \"surf\" they give you but my husband developed a terrible rash all around where his shorts/swim trunks would be which occurred after I washed some of his clothes. He was the only one to come down with it but it took nearly 3 weeks to go away. I hate to leave such negative comments on a review but this was honestly our experience. I won't return to the Platinum hotel because there are others which are better. Perhaps there are two classes of rooms and we never had the deluxe version but I'm thinking mould-free, decent bed, higher quality clean linens, a clean pool and careful valet drivers are a must when paying for a higher priced hotel in Vegas. I can't say our experience here was all bad. Room service was excellent. Our service provider was wonderful, friendly and polite on both evenings. The food was very good and hot on delivery. The restaurant breakfast was very good too and the service equally as pleasant.", "Date": "September 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Albuquerque, New Mexico", "Title": "\u201c\"First Class Experience.\"\u201d", "Author": "David M", "ReviewID": "UR118378424", "Content": "I've been to Vegas so many times and I can say this place absolutely is 1st rate.

The rooms were immaculate and clean with no odors. We had the one bedroom suite with the sofa that pulled out into a bed and it works well for us.

The kitchen itself was the best I have ever seen in a hotel. The bellman saw that we had groceries and took it upon himself to request the pots and pans needed. The valet service was awesome and each time we arrived back at the hotel they would greet us with \"welcome home!\" How awesome is that!?!? They even held the doors open for us and everything! Again, outstanding customer service. We needed the sofa bed sheets and so we called down to request them. Within minutes a lady arrived with the sheets in hand and made the sofa bed up for us! WOW!

We travel to Vegas every August for a trade show and prefer to stay at condo/extended stay hotels due to the length of our stay. We got an amazing deal on a travel website and decided to try it out. The hotel itself is beautiful. It's still fairly new and they did an excellent job with the decor and ambiance. The rooms are absolutely huge! We reserved a solitaire room which is the smallest room at 950 sq. ft. and a Princess Suite which is even bigger at 1150 sq. ft. Really, the only difference between the two suites is size and the Princess suite has a washer/dryer. They were laid out the same and the bathrooms were almost identical. They have huge fully functioning kitchens. The bathrooms were probably the biggest I have seen in a hotel. The only thing I thought was odd about the bathroom was the small shower. It seems unproportional. They each had a jetted tub and a large closet. Very comfy beds with lots of pillows and a nice balcony. These are the quietest hotel rooms I have ever stayed in! The door was very heavy and hard to open but this made for very soundproof rooms. I loved it! Location to the strip is okay. I wish it could be closer but it's not bad. It would have been better for us had it not been in the 110 degree range when we were there. It made walking back and forth miserable. We did like most other people do and cut through Bally's Sportsbook area and then onto the strip. TIP: You can walk through Bally's to Paris and out onto the strip to catch the Deuce or the Express bus for way cheaper than catching a cab! We did this several times and saved a lot of money. The staff was very friendly with the exception of a couple people. The girl at reception was very helpful and got us into rooms on the same floor away from the elevator (as requested). The guys in the front of the hotel (valet, doormen) could have cared less when we arrived. The three of us packed our 5 suitcases into the hotel without even one of them holding the door. I thought this was odd as I have stayed at lesser priced hotels and at least had them hold the door for us. However, each day after that, the door was held open and they valet guys were very, very nice. We did have some issues/confusion with housekeeping. We do cook some of our meals at the hotel due to the length of our stay and almost every dish/utensil we pulled out of the cabinet was dirty. And not just a little bit dirty, some of the silverware actually had peanut butter on them. Caked on. The coffee maker had old stale coffee and grounds in it as well. We used the coffee maker each day and were never restocked on sugar/creamer. We had to go down to the lobby and ask twice. These are very little issues to me though. All in all, it was a very good experience and I would definitely stay here again. You can tell that they take pride in their hotel and are there to serve their customers.

All the rooms are suites and having a kitchen in our room is great!

I have been coming to Las Vegas since 1990 for both holidays and conventions. It is, without doubt, my favourite city in the world for holidays in particular. Anyone who tells you that you can \u2018do\u2019 Las Vegas in 3 days has not opened their eyes to all the city and the immediate surrounding area have to offer (beyond gambling in which I have no interest). Over the years I have stayed at many hotels including t Sahara, Stratosphere, MGM Grand, Luxor, Venetian, Rio to name a few so this review is based on a wide range of experience. Add to this in my day job I spend 100+ nights away from home in hotels and have been lucky enough to have stayed at some of the very best. I have also grown to rely heavily on Trip Advisor to guide me in places where I have no knowledge and to look for a change when visiting a city I know well as was the case when visiting Las Vegas for the past 10 nights. One reason I will write a review is to counter negative reviews where I feel that they are ill informed or unreasonable. Having had an extended stay, I feel well qualified to write what follows. The fact that The Platinum has been at or near the top of the Las Vegas Trip Advisor reviews for at least 12 months in the city with probably the most diverse choice of hotels on the planet is an amazing feat of achievement. This is even more the case when you consider what it offers is a hotel with normal (well except for the room size!) facilities, it is not as is the case with many of its rivals in the city a centre of entertainment. The hotel sits 1.5 blocks from the Strip. Getting to the rear entrance of Ballys takes exactly 7 minutes at a normal walking pace. When you get to Ballys rear entrance you are almost at the Monorail Station so are then within easy reach of all parts of the strip. Also by the back entrance to Ballys is a really good small caf\u00e9/pizza place together with a few small gift shops. If you ignore the Monorail and walk through Ballys to The Strip (it\u2019s cooler than walking outside) another 7 minutes will bring you to The Strip itself, roughly at its mid-point in terms of where all the action is. Hiring a car can be a good idea as if you are staying for any more than a few days what you will pay in Taxis fares will easily pay for a hire car. In our case I rented a convertible for $220 from Enterprise. UK visitors DO NOT be bullied into buying extra insurance. Instead have a look at http://www.insurance4carhire.com/ . One of the few moans about the Platinum is its compulsory Valet Parking. I read one negative review which claimed to have spent $100 on tips for their Valet Parking, all I can say is that the reviewer does not understand the commonly accepted tipping levels ($1-$2) a \u2018park\u2019 paying when you get your car back, not when you drop it off (some folks do it both ways which is too generous in my view!). Another comment and one which would concern me was from the reviewer who said their room had been broken in to while they were in it? I don\u2019t quite get this, all rooms a fitted with the security bar that prevents someone, even with a key, getting access to the room. If your in the room this should be set! I must also say that on a number of occasions I saw security patrolling the floors. Lets be real, this is a big city and as with any big city there is always a small risk of crime and both hotels and guests should work together to prevent it. So far as the quality of the place, its all been said by previous reviewers! The hotel is clean and well maintained, the food good and service excellent. All in all this is a GREAT place to stay in Las Vegas, regardless of the purpose of your visit.", "Date": "August 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Burleigh Heads, Australia", "Title": "\u201cPlatinum lives up to its name - and its TripAdvisor ranking\u201d", "Author": "carpediemoz", "ReviewID": "UR117345983", "Content": "Although the Toastmasters International annual convention we were attending was being held at Bally\u2019s, we chose to stay at The Platinum, a couple of blocks off the strip largely because its guest reviews rank it so high on tripadvisor.com - at the time exceeded only by The Four Seasons (at double to 25 times the price).

So on the 3rd day, quickly headed over to the Platinum. They even accommodated us with an early check-in. Rio advertises suites, which is nothing more than a large room with a small refridgerator. In fact, found this to be true with many of the other strip hotels .. they advertise \"suites\" and you only get oversized hotel rooms. At the Platinum, you have a separate living area, full size kitchen (complete with fridge/dishwasher) spacious bathroom with jacuzzi spa tub and separate glass door shower. You have all the amenities of home, and then some. What really sold us on the Platinum was the main bedroom separated from the living area, by a door. Great for privacy from the teenager, who slept on the sofa bed in the living room. It was enjoyable sitting and eating breakfast on your private balcony, viewing the mountains and some of the strip. Pool area was clean and the indoor/outdoor pool was refreshing.

Valets and porters rushing to open the door for you, always with a greeting and a smile. We never waited more than a few minutes to get our car -- can't say that about our Rio stay. When we called guest services to request bathrobes and pots/pans, a follow-up call made to see if the items were received and if everything was to our satisfaction. About the only \"problem\" encountered during our stay was that on the last day, our room failed to get cleaned. A call to the lobby quickly rectified that situation and fresh towels, extra shampoo and body lotion were brought up.. Since it was late, told them it wasn't necessary to send housekeeping up to make/change the beds. Another call soon followed to confirm our request. Now that's what you call great customer service!

It was clean, spacious, and you could choose a \"regular\" apartment suite, or a more luxurious one with a fireplace, etc. Even in the basic room, the balcony had a nice table and chairs. A surprising plus was how quiet the room was. I was worried because we were near the fitness center - but no problem at all. We didn't hear anything in the hall or the neighbors, and barely heard any outside noise. Our room had a beautiful view of the mountains. The staff were very nice, and especially Julian with the valet staff was so helpful in getting cabs. The Well Spa at the hotel was also amazing. The deep tissue massage was great - and a great value too compared to other spas. The only negatives, which are relatively minor, was the somewhat small menu at the restaurant. Also, it had good food, but not spectacular. However, compared to some of the horrendous reviews I saw of similarly priced strip restaurants, it is a good value. The bed was fine, not spectacular, but hotel beds usually aren't. Although there is no convenience store in the hotel, there are three next to the hotel, and a Starbucks half a block away. Whole Foods is about 10 minutes away in a cab. If we ever have to come to Vegas again, this will be our only choice! Note: The reviews about the other hotels are correct - ANYTHING with a casino STINKS of smoke. As a non-smoker, the stench hits us when we walk through the door, and most dining options are adjacent to or in the casinos so that makes even trying to eat in the large hotels unpleasant.

Also, area is a bit run down - looks like renovation started but hit a problem.

You know, the biggest bang for your buck. I found this little jewel and got a suite room with a \"view\" of a strip. We only paid $119.00 per night so I think it was a fantastic room for what we paid for it. As far as the room was concerned, you couldn't have asked for a better one. The only thing I would have liked better about it would have been if the Solotaire Strip View Suite had a better view of the strip. The room was on the end of the building. If it had been on the front of the building the view would have been much better. I would imagine the Princess Strip View Suite would have been on the front and had a better view but they were more expensive. The walk to the strip was a little farther than I had imagined when I viewed the hotel on a map of Las Vegas. It appeared to be one block off the strip behind the Bally which is right on the Strip.

We used the restaurant once, and the prices were reasonable (especially for Vegas) and the food was good. The pool was a tad murky, but for a quiet couple like us, so very nice not to have a 'zoo' in the pool area. The kids that were there were attended and well behaved. We never had to fight for chairs or umbrellas. Tried to get appointment w/spa on short notice (24 hours), they were booked up - so we went elsewhere for that luxury.

This was our first time and we were thrilled with excellent services and wonderful smiles from the front desk staffs. We arrived at 12:00 PM and they let us check in. No line at all. The hotel is non-casino and non-smoking room in all areas so it is great for young kids and adults alike. Room was great with big fridge and freezer, marble counter top, and working area. They did not have pots and pan stored, but you can call the front desk and they will bring them right up. There will also be a follow-up phone call to check if you receive them. This hotel has a good procedure to ensure that your stay is wonderful and pleasant. I can tell that they have a good management team here. Bath room is huge with a jet bathtub and a stall for a shower bath. Dining area is also nice. Bed is comfy wiht two TVs in the room (one for me and one for my daughter after a long day). Internet is free if you book your room directly with the hotel. Pool is on the 5th floor. They have both indoor and outdoor pool connected with one another. Children bath toys and noodles in the box are located next to the pool. You can also enjoy a poolside breakfast there as well. It was very pleasant in the morning because the building itself blocked the son and it's not up and shined on your head until noon. The hotel also surprised me with a birthday card and two Norwagian water bottles on the following day. When I opened up the fridge, there were chocolate dipped strawberries inside. My daughter loved it and said what a wonderful hotel! At the reception area, there are chocolate chip cookies, sugar cookies, lime water, straweberry/orange water, and apples for refreshment. The hotel is located one block away from Bally's and strip. We purchased three days unlimited pass to monorail to go everywhere in Vegas. It was $28 per person. I believe kids under 5 ride free. Since I have youngs kids, we tried to walk from hotel to hotel to avoid the heat. We came back to the hotel very late at night after seeing the Lion King show at Mandalay Bay and had to walk from Bally to Platinum. Duringn our walk, we didn't find anything that made us feel uneasy. The lights are all over the places and there were many tourists walking with us. There were so much to do in Vegas.

This place is about you, your enjoyment and your comfort. It is great that you don't have to fight your way past gamblers and gamers, slots and restaurants just to get to your room. That said, if playing the slots or tables is your thing, then there are several major hotels/casino's just a few steps away (5 minutes walk maximum) where you can gamble through to the early hours.

The bar staff, were excellent, funny & helpful, witty and again nothing was too much trouble and the same goes for the guys whatever time of day you arrived or wanted to leave the valet parkingteam were were there waiting and enthusiastic.

Staff: This is by far the best asset the Platinum has. Every single staff member was extremely helpful. Coming from the UK and Australia, we are not accustomed to tipping as it's not part of our culture. I did tip however whenever our bags were brought up/moved etc but I never got the impression that a tip was expected at all. Juan, Julian, Verun, Nathan, Rebecca and a host of others, genuinely made us feel like they were only there for us. This is a major credit to thehotel. I don't know what method of staff training and motivation program they have, but they need to keep on doing whatever it is they are doing because it's working. My job involves me evaluating suppliers every day, I've done it for 15yrs and whilst I've never done it in the hospitality industry, I do know how to tell a service provider that cares from one that doesn't. Bravo to them all on this. The hotel is just the right 'vibe' for us, fairly low key but something to do always. We made use of the pool area and never felt pressured into ordering from the pool/bar menu at any time. We did not eat in the resaurant but we did have a bar snack on our first night, which was half price due to the 4-8pm happy hour. The only downside to our stay was that on Saturday night there was a party above us and we could not sleep. There seemed to be a lot of people in the room. I did call security as I had someone knocking on my door looking for the party (above us). The issue was dealt with by hotel security in a professional manner. All the staff were very helpful about this and wanted to know how things were for us the next day etc. We had to be up early Sunday morning for a trip to Grand Canyon so I did not get to speak to anyone properly about it until Sunday afternoon. I spoke to Nathan who arranged for us to move to the 16th floor on our return from our GC trip on Sunday afternoon. It was a very quiet room and had a different view from our other room which was nice as well (still a Strip view). I don't think there would have been any issue with staying in our old room after saturday night but it was great to have a different view for our remaining 4 nights anyway. Summary: A fantastic place to stay. The walk to the strip is not far, even in the heat and the staff and overall experience cannot be beaten for the money. I've stayed in much more expensive hotels and have sometimes gotten a lot less in terms of service from them compared to what I received at Platinum. I'd recommend anyone to stay at this hotel if you're looking for a bit of a 'geatway' from the hustle and bustle of the Strip. Our incident with the party on Saturday night was far far outweighed by the overwhelming positive experience of our other 7 nights.

Thought we'd try it again this time, and although there were many options (including on-strip hotels), I worked with Nathan in making room reservations and he made the booking process so convenient and smooth that we went ahead with staying at the Platinum again. There is something to be said about professional and excellent customer service- Nathan clearly cares about representing the hotel well. Nothing was overlooked in our room reservation process- everything went as smoothly as we had hoped when we checked-in (my pet peeve is when the hotel staff has communication problems and we don't get the room type we expect- thankfully, this was not a problem here!). Anyways, upon staying at the hotel again, we were not disappointed! Despite being pretty busy, the hotel front staff members were excellent and efficient (it's amazing how so many hotels don't get this correct- given how front desk service can really affect guests' hotel experience). The rooms were very LARGE and clean (everything still seemed new and in great condition, despite it being another year of wear-and-tear with Las Vegas guests). We were traveling with our son, and it is SOOO much better to have the separate bedroom/living room areas so that we could have our privacy. And with the fully functional kitchen- we were able to easily make breakfast in the morning. Also, the view of the strip from our room was fantastic! Lots of usual Las Vegas strip lights, and my son especially loved seeing the monorails go by. The hotel is obviously run by good management who ensure that the rooms are well-maintained, and the front desk is running smoothly. We had no difficulty with valet parking at all- again, despite it being busy. During check-out, we were able to call down to the valet and put in a request for the bellman and valet. I think this helped with the valet experience being fine for us (I remember staying at one of the on-strip 5-star hotels previously and they didn't allow us to call down beforehand to valet- irritating!). Also, when we first arrived, my sisters had to rush to check in so that they could make it to the Jersey Boys show-- the valet guys were great in making sure that the car was in the front and ready to go when my sisters were- no delay and they made it to show on time. We ate in the downstairs restaurant, and honestly- it was just OK. Next time, we'd probably stay in the room and order room service (which worked well last time- not too expensive and decent food).

The bathroom had a spa/hot tub, shower and two sinks, all clean and in excellent condition. The one and only caveat I would place on this hotel is its location. The walk from the crossroads on the Strip (which house other hotels like the Bellagio) to the hotel passes several liquor stores, an employment office for the larger hotels and a few dark car parks. As such, the many homeless people that are situated in Las Vegas, along with some people who clearly start drinking from an early time, make you a bit wary when walking back to the hotel.

We ate at the restaurant for lunch a couple times and it was good. There is not a big selection on the menu but we did enjoy what we ordered. The walk to the strip was as everyone said, about 2 blocks and if you don't mind inhaling the smoke, you can cut through Ballys by the 2nd block. It really was a pleasant walk as the weather was decent when we visited. There is a big empty lot you have to pass and I would not have felt safe walking by myself at night but the area is very busy so we felt fine as a group. Cabs in vegas are very reasonable. We did not have a problem getting one to take us to a show one evening or to the other hotels for sight seeing. The valet was able to get us one right off of Flamingo. If you need a cab from the strip just go into one of the hotels and there are plenty of them. We were told it was illegal for the cabs to just stop on the street.

There was also plenty of room to setup and get 4 or 5 hours of work done each morning.

Likewise, there are no entertainment options inside the hotel other than a small cafe that closes at 2:00 p.m. and a lounge bar. The rooms also look directly over the roof of a 7-11 and dry cleaner.

We knew going in that this hotel was off the strip and we'd have to walk a bit or take a cab to get places - not a huge problem. We got a deal on the room for $75 a night through sniqueaway.com, so we were willing to deal with that. What I wasn't aware of was that the hotel looked over a gas station on one side, and a power plant across the street. So, don't expect much from the surroundings. Our room was nice and large, clean and well furnished. We were on a fairly high floor so we had a decent view and it was quiet. Nice to have a full kitchen though we didn't use it much. The bathroom is huge, with a large tub that was fabulous for a soak. The only issues we had with the room were 1) There was no body wash/bubble bath soap, so I used shampoo for the bath instead; 2) The phone in the living room didn't work. Not major problems. We also liked that the hotel is smoke-free and doesn't have a casino, and that they put an emphasis on being environmentally-friendly. It's a much more serene experience than the other hotels/casinos. The reason this hotel isn't a winner in my eyes is the service. There were a few hiccups that made the experience less enjoyable. The biggest issue we had was with room service, starting with the snotty/bored-sounding woman who answered the phone and took our order both mornings, and ending with the second morning when we waited almost an hour for brewed coffee (our initial request for house coffee, as it is called on the menu, got us a packet of coffee grounds instead of the brewed stuff we wanted.) Considering we were staying there on a Monday and Tuesday, I didn't think the hotel could be that busy and didn't understand why it took so long to get our orders. The food itself was ok, nothing to write home about. For a hotel that calls itself \"green,\" I was hoping for things like organic eggs and jam without high fructose corn syrup in it. Then there was an instance in which we asked for a cab to be called for us, as we were going out for dinner and a show. We were told we'd have to come downstairs and then ask the valet for the cab. So here we are, all dressed up, standing in the heat waiting for the valet to show up at the front of the hotel and call a cab. We were told the cabs wouldn't wait... except we were coming right down and were there in minutes. I don't get that. When we checked out, a bellboy took our luggage downstairs and we asked for our car to be brought up front. After checking out at the front desk downstairs, we went outside up front and waited for our car and luggage. The two valets working were running around like chickens with their heads cut off trying to help everyone that was checking out at 11 a.m., and the whole operation seemed disorganized - nothing like the quick service at the bigger hotels. Finally it was our turn, and we are told our car was waiting on the SIDE of the hotel with our luggage this entire time. Great. Finally, they charge $10 a day for in-room wireless internet (while giving it away for free at the pool, restaurant and lounge) which I think is highway robbery and super annoying. I think if they work out all the kinks in service, this would be a decent place if you don't mind the distance from the strip. But on our next trip to Vegas, we'll probably pay a bit more and stay somewhere more central and hopefully without the service issues.", "Date": "June 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Canberra", "Title": "\u201cHuge double bath, very nice\u201d", "Author": "sim_zlatko", "ReviewID": "UR114173369", "Content": "We enjoyed our stay here.

We weren't sure that we wanted to be off the strip, but with a Number 3 rating out of 289 on TripAdvisor, and after reading the reviews we decided to go with it. Well, it was unbelievable and if and when we return to Vegas we will definitely stay here again. Thanks again to TripAdvisor, they have never steered us wrong. We were with my 90 year old dad, and 85 year old mom and my dad stated to me: \" I have done a lot of traveling in my life and have stayed in many, many places but none like this.\" He was thrilled. We stayed in a suite and the room was to die for; a fully equipped kitchen (glasses, dishes, silverware, etc.), a full sized refrigerator and freezer, stove, diswasher and microwave. The counter for eating at was just beautiful and with four stools. There was a full living room area, extremely comfortable with a flat screen HD tv, a lovely separate large bedroom, a bathroom with a double sink, a shower stall and a jacuzzi bathtub. In addition, we were on the 12th floor and we had a balcony outside that had a Vegas strip view, with the mountains in the background. Breakfast is not included, but there is no resort fee so they balance each other out. On the strip you pay for breakfast and have the resort fee. The breakfast menu is very varied and the food was great. The pool area was large as there is a connecting indoor, outdoor pool. It is adjacent to the restaurant so one can easily eat outside on the pool deck. Another interesting thing that I have not seen before is that on the pool deck there was a large chest and inside the chest were all kinds of water toys for children to use while in the pool (tubes, balls, noodles etc.). These provided free to the guests by the hotel. The lounge in the hotel offers half-price drinks and appetizers every night from 4-8. It is a slight walk to the strip. My husband and I could have done it quite easily I assume but we did not walk because we were with my parents. Although they are in very good physical health, we knew we would be doing quite a bit of walking in the casino/hotels and along the strip and did not want to add this extra amount, especially at night . We had a rental car. At the Platinum it is required that you use Valet parking for your car, but that turned out to be very easy. We never had to wait more than a few minutes to get our car, and it was an extremely short and easy drive to the strip. In addition the free (unless you choose to tip) valet parking at the hotels on the strip was very easy to use . Or if you choose to do self-parking at the hotels on the strip you can do that too. All in all, the Platinum is a phenomenal place to stay!!! In addition,it is an eco-friendly hotel, and even the water from the refrigerator is purified water.

The staff were wonderful and when they found out that we had gotten married in the morning that evening there was a bottle of champagne and the biggest chocolate coated strawberries we have ever eaten, yummy. The happy hour everyday includes not only drinks at half price but the food too and the food was great. Our room was a fantastic size, with an awesome bathroom complete with spa... the kitchen fully equipted meant that we could have meals here if we wanted to with a 7Eleven close by, this kept our costs down which meant we had more to use on our sightseeing, there is also a washer/dryer so again no laundry to pay out for. This is a non smoking hotel, very clean and anything you require is promptly delivered or dealt with. Starbucks just across the road at The Westin so again you don't have to walk too far. We didn't eat at the restaurant here as there were plenty close by. Possibly the only drawback for us was the outdoor pool, we thought there was not enough cover although there is an indoor pool for kids, it was really too hot to sit outside so we didn't use the pool area at all. Monorail is about five mins away and a cheap and easy way to get around the strip. Big tip.. carry water with you and lots of one $1's as you can buy water around the strip for $1.

You opened doors, were a few steps ahead pushing the button when we went to get the elevator, answered questions on the front desk, came and repaired a problem with the TV, cleaned our room and made sure all the necessities were there, gave us frozen melon balls at the pool, and finally on our last day hailed the cab for us that wisked us off to that busy airport.

The Platinum Hotel & Spa was the ideal choice because of all the above plus full kitchen, proximity to the Strip, and a whirlpool. After a lengthy flight and an exhausting shuttle from McCarran, we checked in to the Solitaire Suite with two Queen beds + kitchen + whirlpool. To our shock and dismay, the whirlpool was very small almost apartment-sized! It would only fit a person with a small frame. Outside the room was a sign that stated something as a room for handicapped persons. We weren\u2019t sure if the tiny whirlpool is designed for them. However, the large size of the Solitaire Suite would certainly allow for a two-person whirlpool. We immediately complained and asked for an upgrade. Fortunately, the staff member, Nathan, was kind enough to give us a complimentary upgrade to the Princess Suite. We had to wait for an hour since it was being cleaned. As soon as we came back to the Princess Suite, we were pleasantly surprised with the suite. It was huge! It included a full kitchen, 2 Queen beds, 2 TVs, Internet access, balcony with patio furniture, a washer/dryer, and a large bathroom with a whirlpool to fit two people. Overall, it was quiet except for the odd garbage truck noise overnight. Most importantly, we were very comfortable. We planned to rent a car and drive to suburbs of Vegas. We inquired about buying a map but it wasn\u2019t available at the hotel. Next door was an am/pm gas station that had maps for sale. In a bizarre way, there was a sign to not open the maps or we had to buy them. We took the risk and bought them. What a major mistake!! You seriously need a microscope to see the names of the streets! Don\u2019t waste your $10 on this garbage. If you need good maps, go to the ABC Store in the Miracle Mile Shops. Also, go there for cheap munchies, souvenirs, and alcohol. Valet parking is mandatory. Unlike other Vegas hotels, we didn\u2019t have the option to park our car by ourselves. The walk from the Strip to the hotel was roughly 10 minutes. Finding a taxi in front of the hotel was difficult. Thus, we had to go across the street at the Westin Hotel to get one. Bonuses: complimentary access to two jugs of fresh water infused with strawberries or citrus fruits, free newspapers, cookies, and apples. We didn\u2019t inquire about access to a computer printer to print out our boarding passes. Instead, we went over to the Bellagio where the staff was very helpful in not only directing us to their free use of the printer but to direct us to a great rental car place in their premises. Checking out was trouble-free. We were surprised to hear that we weren\u2019t charged for the Internet service. Normally, it would go for $9.95 per night. Due to the rocky check-in, we probably won\u2019t come back.

We booked this hotel because it is a totally non smoking (including the pool area), non gaming hotel set slightly back off the strip. We stayed in a Princess Suite which was huge and including a fully fitted kitchen with microwave, range oven and hob, American style fridge, washing machine and dryer as well as a full compliment of crockery, pots and pans etc. Washing up liquid, paper towel and a dish cloth are provided as well as a dishwasher. The lounge area is seperated from the kitchen by a large breakfast bar area. The lounge includes a sofa/sofa bed, chair 50\" plasma TV, living flame fire, workstation/desk, coffee table and opens directly on to a fully furnished balcony. The bedroom includes a king size bed with feather pillows, bedside tables and a walk in wardrobe, a further TV set upon a a set of drawers. A panoramic window overlooks the strip (or the mountains depending which room you are in). A large, double jacuzzi, seperate double shower, his and hers sinks with large vanity area and full size cupbaord for coats, dressing gowns (which come complementary) and which houses the ironing board, iron and hairdryer. The reception area leads to the Stir bar/restaurant which does a happy hour from 5-8pm each day with free canopes and wine each Weds between 5-6pm. Happy hour is great for bottled beers with Becks at $2.25 a bottle (normally $4.50) and a Mojito cocktail costing $5.00 rather than $10. Bar snacks include Angus Sliders (three mini burgers) Salmon mouse on toast, three types of humous with pitta bread and I enjoyed the fish in cheese sauce. All reasonable and great value for money in the happy hour. The pool bar opens from about 12-5pm and served the same drinks as the main bar but has a different menu. I would recommend the Cobb Salad, which was so delicious. The cheese and chicken quesadillos were also very yummy. The standard burger was fine and typical American size portions. Huge!. The pool side loungers are comfortable and come in a range of typical loungers, cabana sized beds with over head canopies for shade and a few large round love seat style chairs which were great for cuddling up with a book and large cocktail. The pool is only about 4ft at all parts of the pool with walkd down steps. The pool has a small canal style entrance joining the indoor pool with the outdoor pool, quite different and lovely to swim from the warm to the cold or vice versa. There is also a fantastic gym with modern and clean equipment. The hotel also has a spa/beauty salon, though we didn't use this. Room service menu is reasonable for a hotel and you are not served \"ping food\", there is a chef cooking at all times of the day, so you get high quality food. Room service is charged at an additional $3.00 trip charge olus 20% service charge added to. I could have easily tipped again having not read this, but the delightful delivery lady told me that all charges were included. Room service food served on silver ware and over the course of our 9 days we had 3 complementary bottles of champagne brought to our room to help us celebrate. The hotel is actually within walking distance (30mins) if you have light luggage but BE WARNED, we were charge double the regular taxi fare as we didn't know the quickest route. If you are taking a taxi then insist that the driver comes straight out of the airport and goes along Paradise, not the highway on to the strip. Our \"rip off taxi\" was $30 and our \"correctly charged return taxi was only $12.50. We were told that had we got a receipt and the name of the driver and company we could have complained but we learned this too late. A few wise words. We walked from our hotel to the Strip each day (five mins), quite safe so long as you cross at the lights etc. The Strip is quite safe to walk along 24 hours a day from Mandalay Bay to Hilton Towers Grand Vacations. However beyond the Hilton (which is as you head towards the Stratopshere hotel, The Sahara hotel - now closed, and NASCAR) I would strongly advise you catch the bus. I would NOT walk past the Stratosphere and I certainly would not walk past the Hilton after dusk. Unfortunately this area is very run down with many homeless and less desirables. Downtown Vegas, i.e The Freemont Street area, the Golden Nugget area etc I would not recommend you stay in, nor walk about after dusk. I was really disappointed at the state of this area. On the Strip (Mandalay Bay to Hilton) you will be bothered by the street touts selling girls/sex/shows etc. It's a pain in the backside and if you ignore them as my partner and I did you often get shouted after and not the kindest of words. We saw one man square up to one of these touts which wasn't pleasant. Las Vegas, is an experience of grand proportions. Everything is huge. Hotels (with canals/gondolas, theme parks, theatres, casinos, shark reefs, lion reserve and shopping malls the size of your average high street INSIDE the hotels!) It's worth having a look inside the hotels as each one is themed. A 24 hour bus ticket costs $7 and we bought this at 4.30pm one day and it lasted until the same time the following day which is ideal. We took a trip to the Grand Canyon with Let's Go Tours and paid $139 each however we learned that we could have paid $80 each had we negotiated direct with the company. The driver drove safely, was knowledgeable and the tour included a very light breakfast and lunch ( we were still hungry, but its something). All in all we loved the Platinum hotel, Las Vegas was good, but once you've seen one casino, they are all the same and very smokey. The grand Canyon was breathtaking so if you are only going to Vegas once, then it's worth going to the Canyon and do the South Rim tour which has better view points.

The hotel in non-smoking and gamble-free - two oddities for Las Vegas. I must say, we loved that aspect. Returning to a nicely lit hotel with clean air was a treat, as I have stayed in many on-strip hotels that are filled with smoke and dinging slots. The people were very friendly during our stay, and the room was HUGE. Adorned with two giant TV's, a full kitchen, king bed and double sinks in the bathroom we were HUGELY impressed with the size of the room for the reasonable price. It is also within reasonable walking distance to the strip. Additionally, the pool gets great sun coverage all day - and is not packed like many Vegas pools. It was much more relaxing. Sadly, we will not return to the Platinum. We opted to use the jacuzzi in our room one night, as the hot tub was already closed. The next morning, my skin started breaking out in small white bumps - similar to pimples. It was much different than anything my skin had done before, and within hours I had developed these bumps on my neck, jaw, shins and arms. It was awful. Before I was able to get in with my dermatologist, I was google-ing all skin conditions associated with hotel stays, which was extremely stressful and very upsetting. Within 24-hour, my friend also developed the same symptoms. My dermatologist diagnosed it as hot tub folliculitis, an infection that comes from bacteria in hot tub or jacuzzi jets. When I called the hotel to let them know what had happened, no one bothered to call me back. My friend also called, and the man he spoke with said his wife had had hot tub folliculitis and her symptoms were not as my friend described so it could not be the same. Overall, we were very disappointed with the lack of response and courtesy given. We were not asking for a refund, rather we wanted to let them know what had happened. Instead, we were ignored.", "Date": "June 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Edinburgh, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cA fantastic option close to the Strip\u201d", "Author": "SusieBMck", "ReviewID": "UR112060323", "Content": "We were in Vegas for 7 nights and had originally intended to stay on the Strip for the whole week, but having seen the great reviews for the Platinum on Tripadvisor we decided to split the week 4 nights at the Platinum and 3 nights at The Mirage.

From the Platinum it is a 10 minute walk to Bally's, The Bellagio and Paris Las Vegas on the Strip, and we never had any concerns about walking back late at night/in the early hours. We did a couple of trips outside Vegas and they didn't offer pick-up service from the Platinum, but were happy to pick us up outside nearby Bally's. Our suite (Princess Suite) was massive for 2 people and we each had a very comfortable double bed. The suite had a well-equipped kitchen for preparing food and a balcony with views towards the Strip and the snow-capped mountains beyond. We didn't ever visit the restaurant but took full advantage of the 1/2 price tapas (which were delicious) and drinks during Happy Hour every night at the bar, and we were pleasantly surprised by the choice of free wine available at the Manager's reception on the Wednesday night.

A special thank you to Varun on the front desk. On our arrival from an 11 hour flight he could have not done anymore to help with any question we had, made the check in as quick as possible so we could just relax in our room and WOW what a room, it was the biggest hotel room we have ever been in, everything you could wish for, king size bed, view of the strip. He gave us a map of the strip and info booklet and recommended the best way to get reduced tickets for food and shows and the times the kiosks opened. The room didnt have pots and pans or bath robes but a quick call down to front desk and two secs later a knock on the door there was everything, amazing service. We went for the hotel mainly for it location, yes it is 5/10 min walk off the strip but Bally's was only 5 mins away where there is a tram stop. This was so usefull as we then could go north or south and be at either end of the strip within a few mins. We were walking around all the gambling hotels on the strip and to see the people walking through the main casino just to check and these can be 5/10mins with a heavy case(if you are going with a lady who has to carry everything and the kitchen sink), then walking back through the casino to where the room was located another 5/10mins. I didnt fancy that. At the Platinum you are greeted at the front door, in to the main lobby and straight to your room no hassle, no walking through a mass of people and no smoke. I am not going to lie we did have a few little problems with the door lock, but a phone call from the phone located in all the lift areas a member of security came up, had to show I.D to prove we were staying in the room it was all sorted. Every hotel gets problems it is how the hotel sorts them out is key and we could not fault it. There is a 7Eleven and fuel stop next to the hotel, and also a 24hr mini mart across the road so you don't have to go far to pick up a few things. Also a U.S Bank 5 mins away so if you're taking travellers cheques (which we strongly recommend as all the ATM's charge varying amounts to withdraw money ontop of your bank charges) which is commision free. They also offer a grocery ordering/delivery service. The pool was not the biggest or most elaborate but it was great for us (when we could tear ourselves away from the strip!) comfy loungers and excellent service.

Everything in Vegas is farther than it seems, so I'd say it was maybe a 15 minute walk. And if you like to walk like I do, do it. It's not sketchy, lots of people are out. Would I walk at 3am? Probably not, but still, it's fine. If you don't want to walk, get a bus pass. $20 will give you all-access for three days and it's an easy way to get around anyway. To get to the Strip, the stop is at the corner across the street and to come back it drops you off right in front. Since it's not a huge hotel, cabs probably won't be waiting around at all hours. Rooms: Gorgeous! Stayed in the Princess Suite with two queen beds which are the MOST comfy beds I've ever slept in. Nice and soft, I love it. The big window looked out across Flamingo Rd away from the strip. Not the most fantastic view, but I could see the mountains and the sun came in around 8 am. Love. The tub is the bomb. Big enough for two, but lovely for one, especially when you want a nice relaxing jet massage. :) Also liked the fake fireplace. Nice touch. And I wanted to steal the big makeup mirror, but I didn't. I swear. I'm not sure when the cleaning people came by, but it isn't at 9am like regular hotels, so that was much appreciated. You never feel like you're being rushed out the door in the morning. The staff washed all the glasses and dishes we left out too. Thank you! One more thing: internet is only free if you book through their website. Otherwise it's $10 per day or you can use the free hotspot in the lounge downstairs. Amenities: The pool is great. Half indoor/half outdoor. And did I mention it's heated? Cuz it is. My friend and I usually showed up around 10:30, 11ish so it was never crowded. And it's a smaller hotel, not some people rodeo, so it was always quiet. Food: Stir Lounge is awesome! Go for the happy hour everyday from 4 - 8 and the whole menu is 50% off. My only disappointment is that they were out of some lobster risotto balls or something. The happy hour menu is bigger than the one on the website, don't go by that.

Oh, free flavored water all day by the front desk. Fruit in the morning, cookies at night. :-9 Service: The whole staff is great. Speedy and easy check in and check out. I had a late flight so they held my bags for the afternoon. Room service was crazy quick. Everyone is really polite and happy too, always asking if they can help me with something. I read the bad reviews and I'm convinced those people are crazy. If you don't want housekeeping in your room during the day, put the privacy please sign up. I met almost the whole front desk staff and they never copped an attitude or refused to help me or fix something. Be polite and they'll be polite right back. If you think it's noisy, that's your neighbor's fault, not the hotel. I never heard a peep. If you don't like the view, move. There's a restaurant and bar on one of the upper floors. Sit at the pool. Who stays in their room and looks out the window anyway? Voodoo Lounge at the Rio, go there. Or the Eiffel Tower. It's SUGGESTED that you tip valets, not required. If you're going to complain, keep your money. And don't say someone forced you, that's BS. Lastly, if you think the area is full of \"vagrants\", don't go to big cities. Everyone minds their business as long as you mind yours. Thanks, Platinum Hotel!!! I look forward to staying with you again. :D", "Date": "May 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, California", "Title": "\u201cExcellent off-Strip non-gaming hotel\u201d", "Author": "coolcaesar", "ReviewID": "UR109419981", "Content": "I stayed at the Platinum over Christmas weekend 2010 for a badly needed vacation. I recommend the Platinum Hotel & Spa to anyone looking for a reasonably priced nice off-Strip hotel that is upscale, pleasant, and quiet, and is seeking to avoid the overcrowded, tourist-jammed, noisy, factory-line nature of the huge Vegas megaresorts. The Platinum's decor is contemporary and soothing. The room and bed were comfortable, well-maintained, and excellent. The fitness center and pool were superb. I especially liked the indoor/outdoor pool feature where one can comfortably enter/exit the pool in the indoor room (where the ambient temperature is kept toasty), and swim through the channel to the outdoor pool. The rates were reasonable compared to the megaresorts, too. The exterior balconies are a nice touch not available at megaresorts (or most other Vegas hotels either). The significant downside to the Platinum, as many other reviewers have noted, is that it's jammed onto a tiny lot in a sketchy neighborhood about two blocks east of the Strip. This resulted in several awkward design compromises at ground level, such as mandatory valet parking, a small lobby, and a cramped porte cochere where the valet parking people are constantly running around to keep the cars flowing. Other than that one issue, though, the Platinum is still an excellent choice.", "Date": "May 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Montego Bay, JA", "Title": "\u201cMade us feel like a king and queen\u201d", "Author": "jamaicajohn", "ReviewID": "UR109327840", "Content": "I am semi-retired and have traveled the world.

BUT it does have short comings, when we arrived the pool was full of drunk 20 year olds shouting at each other and up to their mates on the upper floors, just what you want after a 3 hour drive, never mind this is Vegas we thought. After getting changed we went down to the bar only to find it was happy hour (half price drinks 4-8) guess what they had all now moved to the bar, so back up to our room and try the in room dining ( as restaurant is only open for breakfast and Lunch NOT dinner!!) which seemed very reasonably priced for a hotel. Food arrived promptly but on further inspection my wife\u2019s sweet and sour had no rice, phoned up room service only to be told \u201cok we will send some up\u201d, no sorry from them or the lady who brought the rice. The price of the meal was knocked off our bill but we only found this out when we checked out no one told us or left a note in the room apologizing. Later on we ventured down to the pool area only to find it littered with wet towels,cans,plastic glasses and bits of food, not impressed. Next morning we were charged for breakfast (even though we had breakfast included in our rate) this also happened the following morning. My wife rang up to complain and the woman at billing started to argue with her until my wife told her to look at our booking, she then changed her tone and said it would be knocked off the final bill, again no apology. In the afternoon we went to sit by the pool, the lady who took our drinks order lost our bill along with everybody elses round the pool so we had to sign twice then around four a manager came out with a cleaner and started rearranging the sun beds and power wash the deck even though people were still relaxing around the pool, again not impressed. Also as others have said the strip is a ten minute walk which is ok during daylight but seems to attract shall we say the more undesirable element at night. we only popped to the 7Eleven behind the hotel and were approached by street people asking for money. To sum up it is a very nice clean hotel but needs to make up its mind what type of clientele it wants to attract either couples/families or the party crowd it cannot have both also it really needs to brush up on customer service being nice is not the same as being helpfully.

Great Experience.\u201d", "Author": "TravelingBeautifully", "ReviewID": "UR109004619", "Content": "Why I picked this hotel - After carefully researching all of the hotels Las Vegas, I kept reading amazing reviews on The Platinum Hotel. This is a relatively unknown, more obscure hotel, just off the strip that constantly got raves for space and efficiency. When the price dropped to \u00bd off on SniqueAway.com, I jumped on it and promptly booked a 1200 SF Princess Suite, strip view. Check in \u2013 After many trips to Vegas, I have spent my fair share of time waiting in line for my room at the check in, demoralizing my trip. (I am talking to you, Venetian.) Not here. I was greeted promptly by a bellman from my cab, then welcomed by a very friendly night attendant. They had me for a single bed, when I wanted a double. Without hesitation, they moved me up to the 15th floor for 2 queen beds. The lobby was decorated modernly and modestly, with good taste and chilled water for guests. In fact, there were 2 large containers of chilled iced water, with slices of oranges inside one container and with slices of limes in the other. How nice! There were also light cookies and apples to refresh yourself after your flight in the lobby. This property was clean, efficient, and calming inside \u2013 exactly what I was going for. Rooms \u2013 The room was an amazing, huge space overlooking the Las Vegas strip and I was instantly impressed. (The rooms here are all eco-friendly, so once you stick your room key in the activation slot, everything electronically in the room will operate.) This is also great because you always know where your room key is! The rooms have granite counter tops, stainless steel appliances, full sized refrigerator, ice maker, water dispenser, full sized stove, oven, and cupboards are stocked with dishes /silverware. The living room has a very nice pull out couch, fireplace, and small work station for business needs. What I loved was that you actually have your own balcony, so you can go out there and have dinner overlooking the Las Vegas strip if you wanted to. What I also liked was that the room had a fireplace in it, which was activated with a flip of a switch, no hassle. This gave the room a romantic feel, so it could go either way as a romantic room for couples or a nice, spacious room for families. I loved the size of this room, because it gave me the option of having all of my Vegas friends over and not feel crammed into a tiny space. My friends were able to comfortably lounge on the couch, enjoy the view from the balcony, or help themselves to a drink in the spacious kitchen. The room was perfect! Another nice amenity was that it had a washer & dryer inside the room. It always sort of disgusted me to haul home dirty laundry in my luggage, comingled with my clean clothes I didn\u2019t wear. Here, I was able to wash everything up quickly before I caught my flight. No dirty, gross, soiled clothes roaming around my suitcase! They provide you with detergent and dryer sheets; they really think of everything here for you. Bathroom - The bathroom is enormous with double sinks, granite counter space, and big shower. They all have a sunk in Jacuzzi tub, and it worked perfectly with a push of a button. It was really nice to get to soak in a big tub after a long day of walking the strip, so I appreciated the big tub. (They sell really amazing dissolving bath salts in the shape of an ice cream scoop for your tub, $9, single use, in the spa. Check that out!) There was a makeup mirror, which was nice, but would have worked a lot better if they had them mounted into the wall like most hotels. It was unlit, so I had to kneel on the floor to do my makeup, but it was fine. The provided toiletries were basic and unremarkable, so I would pack the things that you like / need from home. They do provide you with a blow dryer, so you can leave that behind. Bedroom - The rooms have double closets, but have about 5 hangers each, so you may want to call housekeeping for more hangers for your things. Also, I wish I would have called my first day for a bathrobe, because they are free to use while at the hotel, but you do have to call down to get one brought up to you. There is a large view of the strip from both the living room and the bedroom, which was really nice. There is an in-room safe, which worked perfectly when I used it for my laptop. The bed, I would say is comfortable, although not outstanding. They could have had higher quality mattress and linens, but it was fine. Perks \u2013 There are a lot of them! I read online, prior to coming that the free Internet is limited to the common areas and the pool. Not any more. I was given a free Internet card upon check in and had access to Internet throughout the hotel property and in my room, no restrictions. It worked great and I never had a problem with it at all. The other major perk of this place was the food. I could hardly believe that you could get an amazing meal delivered to your room at a super FAIR price, almost unheard of in hotels. The reviews on here said that the food was good and they were right! Because the prices were so fair, and the food was so good for the money, we just kept ordering room service out of sheer convenience. (This hotel is smart in the way that it recognizes that it is off the strip, and people are really at the mercy of the hotel to provide good food, fairly priced to them, which Platinum does repeatedly.) Room service arrived always faster than expected, hot, delicious, and by friendly staff. I have stayed at much higher star rated hotels that didn\u2019t come close to delivering this quality of service. It was truly remarkable and appreciated. Everything we ordered for 4 days was outstanding. What I missed \u2013 This is a very small, modest request, but I actually missed a common Vegas TV station that plays nothing but new music coming out. They had this channel at Mandarin Oriental, South Point, the Palms, and Hard Rock. I always look forward to listening to music on that station while I get ready, and then downloading new music that I like to my laptop from my room. This is something that I look forward to. Also, I figured the room would have something to play my Ipod, but thought I would bring my travel player, just in case. Good thing I did, because there was no Ipod player in my room and that would have annoyed me while getting ready with no music. What I liked \u2013 This property is nothing but value. I loved that I could get a massage here for $85 in a hotel, so close to the strip. I also loved that I could invite my Vegas friends over to the manager\u2019s cocktail party on Wednesday from 5 -6 PM and have food drinks, wine, cocktails for 3 people for $11. Come on. $11? The service was great and staff was super accommodating. This is the perfect hotel and night to invite your local friends over for a little catching up before you head out to the strip for dinner; I was so pleased! Also, I liked that it was a non-gaming property so I wasn\u2019t inundated with noisy slot machines every time I went to my room. I loved that it was smoke free and was sort of a free standing, Vegas sanctuary of peacefulness. I could cab into the chaos, but cab away from it at night. It was perfect. Spa \u2013 Typically, I would not get a service done at a hotel, but because this hotel offered so many affordable services, and didn\u2019t price gouge you, I opted for a Swedish massage with Shelly. When I walked into the actual spa, I was in awe. Everything was new, tranquil, dark, modern, and lovely. I really liked my service and the surroundings inside the spa were perfect. I did read on here previously that the sandals they give you are cheap and uncomfortable inside the spa. That person was right! I ended up 86-ing the sandals provided and putting my own back on for comfort. They need to order more comfy sandals, but other than that, it was perfect. I would definitely recommend this spa and use it again based on quality and value. Overall \u2013 The reviews and ranking of this hotel are correct; it is just plain excellent. Whoever is running this hotel is doing a great job with attention to detail. There is no undertone of pomp or circumstance here with employees; everyone here is warm, friendly and accommodating. At my checkout, the bellman noticed that 3 of us all needed rides to the airport and they used the hotel SUV to drop us all off. Such great service here. From the value of the room, amenities, food, service, and heavily discounted happy hours, you just can\u2019t go wrong here. This hotel is perfect for \u2013 Families, solos, girls getaways, large groups, business professionals, value travel, wedding groups, bachelorette / bachelor parties, those with dietary needs / issues. This hotel is not perfect for \u2013 Someone that wants to be right on the strip, wants a casino onsite, wants a smoking hotel, wants high end-opulence for accommodations.", "Date": "May 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "greyhoundmom24", "Title": "\u201cGreat find!

ROOM: We had a princess suite w/ strip view which was very large (living room, bedroom, large bathroom and a kitchenette) and had a nice balcony looking out towards the strip. The only negative I have is that the pillows were awful, but that was pretty minor. The rooms are energy efficient and require a room key to turn/keep the room's AC/lights on (nice to see a hotel doing that!). At night, we picked up a 6 pack from the gas station nearby and enjoyed a few beers on the balcony. It was such a nice way to unwind after the crazyness of the strip/casinos but still having a view of the strip. LOCATION: We walked from the hotel to the strip and back during the day and night. I didn't think the area was bad at all (no one bothered us while we walked) and I saw a lot of other people/tourists walking in the area. It would be worse in the heat of the summer though. TIP - it is hard to get a taxi from the hotel since they don't have their own taxi stand/area, so we would just walk to Bally's and get a taxi there.

They always had a smile on their face and were eager to accommodate us. Didn't have time to try the restaurants, spa or pool. As others mentioned there is no self parking, only valet. But the staff is very quick and we never waited longer than five minutes for them to bring our car around. Yes there are homeless people who hang out at the gas station next door but the Platinum valet and security do an excellent job of keeping unwanted visitors out. Housekeeping cleaned room daily and provided fresh linens. At some hotels housekeeping begins knocking at your door at 9:00 a.m. We prefer to sleep in so it worked out well that housekeeping didn't arrive until after we left at 11:00 a.m. I needed to google Fedex locations back home and asked the front desk staff where their business center was located. To my surprise the staff member offered to google it for me and printed off his findings which saved me a trip to the business center.

From the photos on the internet I knew it would be a nice hotel, but it was the extras that made this hotel exceptional. The rooms are spacious and flow nicely as soon as you walk in. The kitfchn is fully equiped with an oven, microwave, fridge (with built in ice-maker), and even a full oven. When travelling in Vegas it is nice to have the option to be able to have an occasional meal in your own room. The bathroom had a separate jacuzzi tub as well as a separate shower stall. His and Her sinks were a nice touch. The bathroom had a spa feeling to it. The staff at the hotel make a huge difference. They are very courteous, friendly, and accomodating. They make guests at this hotel feel valued. From the managers to the maintenance staff a high level of professionalism was maintained throughout. The 5th floor restaurant overlooks the indoor-outdoor pool. We went for breakfast twice (before going out to find a grocery store), both times were pleasant experiences at a reasonable price. Valet parking is complementary and they are very quick to retrieve your vehicle. I do like the option of self-park, but could quickly get used to using valet more often. The internet connection is not free, but for Las Vegas this is not uncommon. But the signal strength is high. There may have been a free signal in public areas such as the lobby but I did not investigate this. There is a business center if you only need a short amount of time to keep in touch with family/friends. This hotel does not have a casino, but there is a casino in the hotel located directly beside the Platinum and another as you walk towards the strip. The walk to the strip is roughly 7 or 8 minutes, but you will find that you are at a central part of the strip, i.e. close to Bally's. There are a few homeless people who are on streets in the area, but there is always so much life at this part of town that security is not an issue. From my point of view this hotel provided a nice break from the busy Vegas strip.

After a lot of research, I chose this hotel because we wanted something a bit more intimate than being one of 5,000 rooms in one of the huge casino hotels. We also like our peace and quiet! The hotel really is great. It has a nice layout and a nice atmosphere. Everyone we met at the hotel seemed very chilled and it was nice to be able to get away from the chaos of the strip. The suites are huge and the whirlpool bath is really nice after a day walking round Vegas! and the beds are firm but large and comfortable. The hotel has a happy hour from 4pm until 8pm in their bar area. We only really drank in here once and ordered some of their 'tapas' food, although it's not really tapas (thai chicken skewers, battered prawns etc.), which was good. We ordered room service a few times and the food was good, but you do pay a price for it (like all other hotels we encountered). What made it for us was one of the valet's, Roger, who was excellent during our stay. On several occassions he got out the house car and drove us where we wanted, instead of having to take an expensive taxi (you just tip him). I'd highly recommend you ask if the house car is available as it is very confortable and costs a lot less than a taxi. Sometimes they ask you if you'd like to take it when it is quiet, but ask anyway...it's really worth it. Roger even arranged to have a bottle of bubbly sent up to our room when he found out we'd got married the day before! The hotel is pretty quiet compared to the strip, but it is a 10 minute walk down the road to the Bellagio on the strip. The area it's in is fine, with a few shops to buy basic supplies, although late at night it can seem a little bit dubious, mainly due to some beggars out on the streets. Having said that we walked back at night a few times and because it's along a main road, it was fine. Everyone we met there said they chose it to give them sanity away from the strip, and interestingly, many of those people were seasoned visitors to Vegas, where I think the novelty of staying in a ridiculously austentatious hotel with no chance of being given special treatment, had finally worn off. The Platinum only has 250 rooms, compared to thousands in the other hotels, so you obviously are treated in a much more personal way. If I had to be ultra picky, the only thing I could say about the hotel (apart from the walk to the strip) is that the Strip view isn't all that great and the living room/kitchen can be quite dark as not much natural light comes through the window. Still, the suites do have balconies, which is unusual for Vegas, and the suites are massive! Also, they have a kettle for all us Brits who like a cuppa, which we didn't find in other hotels on the west coast (just coffee machines). When you arrive they also ask you if you want pots and pans to cook with, which is good. Overall, I'd highly recommend this hotel and its staff and if you want a bit of sanity and peace and quiet away from the madness of the strip and don't mind a 10 min walk to get back, this is the place for you! Oh and one last thing......they have the nicest cookies in the lobby I've ever had!", "Date": "May 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Gillingham, Kent", "Title": "\u201cFantastic\u201d", "Author": "Librarian39", "ReviewID": "UR107021438", "Content": "We stayed at the Platinum for 5 nights in May 2011 and could not find fault with any aspect of the hotel or service.

The Gym was well equipped, towels, water and headphones provided. The Strip is a short walk away (we found that it was quicker to cut through Bally's and the Paris to get to the centre of the Strip.)

Opposite the rear entrance to Bally's is a little bar where you can get a bud or bud light for $1.50 and add a hotdog to that for another $1. Fantastic. The Platinum is a smoke free hotel.

This is my 5th time staying here while it was Preferred Hotels and now Marcus Hotels. Even with the change, the hotel is still my favorite. The staff is very friendly and courteous and will always do their best to accommodate you and your needs when you ask. I have stayed at Wynn, Venetian and Palazzo and you will not get this kind of service at the high class mega resorts on the strip without being referred here and there and walking everywhere to get what you need. PROS - The guest suites speak for themselves and is better than my own apartment. Spotless and clean with a spacious bathroom, spa tub, kitchen, own laundry/dryer, and a private balcony. You don't get this on the strip for the comparable prices even on a weekend! - Even better is that it is non smoking because I hate smelling like someone else's exhaled breath. - An invisible housekeeping staff keeps your pad in tip top shape, they don't even have the service hangers on the door to let housekeeping know that you have left and needed turnover! They put dishes in the dishwasher, remade the beds and they even neatly laid out my already ironed clothes that I left on my luggage on the remade bed. Absolutely amazing. (don't forget to tip them) - Very relaxed pool area without the scene and loud music - Amazing happy hour - NO RESORT FEE. I rather put that money to tip the incredible staff they have. - I am very glad that they have decided to include free wireless internet so that I can now keep up with my business! CONS - The only downside is that parking is valet only and is a bit inconvenient when you want to drop off/pick up things for a few minutes without the hassle of valet. That shouldn't be a reason not to stay here, this is my 5th time here and most likely a sixth stay in the future. - The location could be a turn off for some. Walking isn't that bad to the strip since it is no more than 15 minutes but during the summer that would be quite prohibitive or if any in your party are in heels. - More available taxi's but this can be remedied by calling ahead for one if you don't want to wait around for one. - I do wish the hotel could make a minor adjustment in being more environmentally friendly. I left my once used towel back on the ledge by the toilet to dry to reuse and it was already taken away by housekeeping and wasn't replaced with new towels. Just a minor thing but I do like that they now have the room key for the lights instead of going around turning everything off when you leave.

It is a short walk (less than 10 mins) to the corner of Ballys, The Flamingo, The Bellagio and Ceasars Palace. The suites are great, more like an apartment with room service! We booked a strip view which really looks fab at night. Great for enjoying a nightcap. The bedroom is situated away from the hallway and is very quiet. The weather was in the high 80s the week we were there. Relaxing by the pool and the hot tub on the 5th floor was a great start to the day. There is also a steam room and relaxation area on the 4th floor. Food and cocktails are served at the pool so we never managed to leave the hotel until mid-afternoon! On Wednesday evening the hotel hosts a reception for guests with free drinks and nibbles. There is a happy hour in the bar every evening. Customer service is high on the agenda in this hotel.

(I've been to Vegas many times, and always found the strip hotels pretty loud.) Read the reviews here on Trip Advisor, and thought the Platinum sounded good. Since my sister and I were arriving from two different parts of the country, we connected at the airport...and arrived at the Platinum around 11:30am. As the taxi approached, at first I thought, \"Maybe this wasn't such a good idea,\" because it seemed as if we were pretty far from the strip. We arrived to check in...but were told the room wasn't ready, but would be in about an hour. So, we went to the Ellis Island casino, after the bellman suggested it..(it was right around the corner)...and had lunch.(Pretty good by the way...) Came back about two hours later...and was told the room still wasn't ready. Well, by this time, we were getting tired of just killing time...but the man behind the desk basically said, \"Well, you did arrive early...so what can you expect?\" This ticked my sister off...and she suggested we go to another hotel....however, I had already paid for our stay, so I asked if I could see the manager.. I believe his name was Nathan...(if not, please forgive the oversight.) He was very cordial, and told me that our room was ready. After we made our way to our room, we were both pleasantly surprised. The suites were spacious...the kitchen area very functional...and the beds extremely comfortable. Our view overlooked apartments across the street...but we weren't there for the view. We found that our walk to the strip wasn't as long as it looked...and actually, gave us a chance to exercise. The strip is only about 4 blocks away. When I made our reservations, I mentioned that not only was it my sister's birthday, it was also her first trip to Las Vegas. So, on our first night there...there was a knock at the door, and a server presented us with a tray of chocolate and candy covered strawberries, and a bottle of sparkling wine with a card that read, \"Happy Birthday!\" My sister was so impressed, that she has decided we should come back very soon, and of course stay in Room 606. She even joked, that she could live there... So overall, after an initial gaffe, the entire stay at the Platinum was wonderful, and I do plan to return. I've stay at many of the major hotels on the strip, so I can honestly say, that they can't hold a candle to the Platinum!", "Date": "April 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Richmond Hill, ON Canada", "Title": "\u201cBest Girls Trip Ever to Vegas!

Having stayed in strip casino hotels before we didn't want to deal with the hassles of lugging our suitcases through a large casino and waiting in the endless check in line for a one night stay but we wanted to be close to the strip. This hotel is the best of both possible worlds. You are a five minute walk to the corner of Flamingo and Las Vegas Blvd. (this corner has the Bellagio, Bally's, and Caesar's), so this is about the best possible location you are going to get if you are not staying on the strip The rooms are spectacular. Full kitchens with a separate living room and bedroom. The bedroom is far enough away from the door you don't get any hall noise at all. The bathroom contained a shower and a whirlpool along with double sinks. We paid extra for a strip view and while you do get a view of several hotels along the strip, I'm not sure it is worth the extra cost. This hotel is not as tall as the strip hotels, so your view is blocked by the taller hotels . Also, since you are located behind the strip hotels, your best view is of the parking garages and monorail located behind the strip hotels and not the strip itself.

From the moment we checked in until I was put in a cab to the airport, every aspect of our stay was ideal. The rooms are not to be believed: spacious and well-appointed, comfortable and posh at the same time. I was worried that the beds wouldn't be that comfortable, but I slept like a log the entire time. The water pressure in the shower was fantastic, and the jacuzzi tub was a welcome respite after long days of walking around. Maid service was impeccable, and it was wonderful to have a fridge and microwave available when we needed them. It would be great if there were an actual grocery store nearby, but the 7-11 out the back door was one of the best-stocked I've ever seen. The facilities in the public spaces of the hotel are gems as well. The pool is small but uber-clean, and lounges are well-placed and comfortable. Food and beverage service are available, and let me tell you: the restaurant is great. It's very casual and low-key, but everything we ate there was delicious. The spa is small but homey and relaxing, and the services provided are a HUGE value compared to the larger spas in Las Vegas. But what really makes the Platinum THE best hotel in Vegas is their staff. From the folks at the front desk to the waitstaff at the restaurant to the therapists at the spa to the guys out front who get you cabs to the bartenders in the lounge (ask for Matt Taylor. He is by far the best bartender I've ever met, bar none. Ha ha), every single person who works there is friendly, professional and eager to please. The Platinum IS a non-smoking, non-gambling property, but how awesome is it to get a break from the hustle and bustle of the big city?! And it's a short walk to the monorail at Bally's; from there, you can get almost anywhere. Cab rides aren't that expensive if you want to go from point-to-point, but I would NOT recommend walking around in that neighborhood at night; it's a wee bit sketchy.

Just a few minor downsides: 1) Very little cutlery and very few dishes in the room (and no pots or pans). I know we could have called down for these, but it then becomes rather inconvenient. 2) Free internet in lobby and around pool area, but not in rooms -- would have had to pay additional $10 daily. Why not just make it free everywhere? And faster please! 3) Valet parking was generally convenient, but a self-parking option would have been preferred on some occasions, especially on days when we wanted to go in and out a few times. I don't mind tipping the valets, who were very pleasant, but I would prefer not to do it multiple times in one day. 4) The climate control unit in the room was noisy and the only way we could get any sleep was to totally turn it off. Even then, there was an odd dripping noise from the unit. 5) I appreciate having a non-smoking hotel, but why not allow smoking on the balcony with the door closed? I actually like a cigarette with a beer or glass of wine and the balcony view would have been a great place to enjoy this.

The rooms are huge (starting at 950 square feet!), with kitchens that you can actually cook meals in (and there are three mini-marts very close to the hotel, which is a nice plus); large showers and tubs; very comfortable beds; and excellent views from the room balconies (be sure to ask for a view of the Strip). 2. No casino and no smoking = a great place to relax and get away for a while from the craziness of the Strip. :) 3. The prices are great -- you'll get value for your money. 4. The spa, called \"Well\", is fantastic. 5. The service is great and responsive. 6. It's a very short walk to to Ellis Island (best inexpensive steak dinner in town -- ask for the unadvertised special!) and Lawry's (best expensive prime rib dinner in town). Yes, the Platinum is a \"long Vegas block\" off of the middle of the Strip (it's behind Bally's and Paris). So, you won't be right in the \"middle of the action\". However, considering all you get, I think it's worth the walk. And there are some advantages to the location -- for one thing, you won't be far away from the Bally's stop of the Las Vegas Monorail.

The first & second times were only a week apart as we decided to go back there after our first visit instead of spending some time in Los Angeles. It was the right decision as it was great to relax there after a few days of driving & sightseeing. We love that it's a non gambling & non smoking hotel which is well located for getting to the 'Strip' either by walking or by a very quick Deuce bus ride. So when we decided to go to Las Vegas again this year(3rd time) there was no question of where we were going to stay. We were very well looked after in terms of a free upgrade of our room(great view especially when everything's lit up at night), free high speed internet, complimentary breakfast and a fantastic daily happy hour! Our suite was spacious, very clean and our king size bed was extremely comfortable. The Kilawat restaurant was great for breakfast/brunch every day, in room dining service was quick & we love their delicious Stir burgers and the happy hour was fantastic value for food & drink! The only negative was on the morning of our departure when our wake up call didn't happen. Luckily we also had our own travel clock alarm as we had an early morning flight to catch. The Duty Manager at checkout was very apologetic, asked enough questions to be able to identify who'd made the mistake & said he'd speak with them. He also immediately gave us a discount on our final bill which we really appreciated. We will definitely be back again - we love it!!

Three of us stayed for 5 nights; myself and my my two sons, both in their early twenties. The hotel rooms were enormous each with kitchen, living area, balcony and large en-suite bathroom. The service was excellent and Clare attended to us as we booked in ensuring we had super rooms for our stay. The valet team were efficient and looked after us well. The maid service was excellent keeping the rooms in good order throughout our stay, no mean feat with my boys! Much was made of the distance to the Strip, but this was only a block and took about ten minutes walk. The advantage was you ended up right at Bellagio in the centre of the Strip. People staying at say the Luxor or the Wynn, by comparison, would have had a much longer walk to the same point. Being from England we appreciated the relative quiet of the Platinum and the no smoking policy. We all found the casino hotels very smokey and also very noisey. Minor comments on the Platinum are: 1. The pool opens at 10am, so you can't have a morning swim. 2. The room service menu is a little limited; see below generally. 3. The party room on the 17th floor gets a bit noisey. 4. The wait for a cab can take a while and because of the road layout it costs about $5 just to turn around! Expect to pay $10 to get to the Strip, again see below generally. 5. The hotel ventilation would benefit from humidification, it's too easy to get static shocks from the doors and lifts. In general I'd offer the following tips: 1. Hire a car, we spent a small fortune on taxis and wore out quite a bit of shoe leather! 2. We hired a car for the weekend and did Death Valley on the Saturday and Hoover Dam on the Sunday. Both visits are excellent and Death Valley makes a great alternative to the Grand Canyon if you don't have much time. Allow about 5 hours for Death Valley and fill up with fuel in Pahrump. 3. We struggled to find food that wasn't potato or meat! Vegetables are an endangered species in the States! Burgers and steaks are the order of the day in most restaurants. 4. The casino hotel buffets are quite good value, but the food sits around for a while. Better at the end of a mealtime than at the start. Also can someone please explain to American chefs that Fish and Chips in England means fish with fries, not crisps (American chips)!! 5. We won and lost money on the roulette table in Ceasars Palace and won in a poker tournament in O'Sheas. Blackjack wasn't worth playing; with a 6 deck shoe and shuffling between hands in most casinos. Considering it was Chinese New Year the casinos were very quiet.

It\u2019s not a great view (see picture), but still nice & the balcony would be a fine place to have a drink when the outside temperature is right. It is about a 10-15 minute walk to the strip (things are far apart in Vegas). You can get to the strip faster heading to the MGM grand by cutting through Bally\u2019s on the left and then through Paris; cuts about 15 min off of going to the corner (Bellagio & Ceasar\u2019s at the corner). You can also get to the Venetian by walking up the back road across from Bally (you pass an old Italian restaurant on the left. We were told to not eat there). It is a bit deserted, but go straight up the road with a slight curve to the left & walk through the Venetian parking garage and take the elevator up and presto you are in the mall; this saves about 30 min. The hotel was fine and the staff pleasant. I thought the corridors needed a serious vacuuming, but otherwise the place was clean. We did not use the pool, but saw a lot of families using it in the cool weather. We did eat our breakfasts in the restaurant and they were much better than expected; pleasant staff there too. With so many choices we would probably try another hotel next time (we\u2019ve stayed at the Venetian twice and Treasure Island once).

The Platinum Hotel certainly fit the bill. The walk to the strip is about 10 minutes, which is a small price to pay considering the hotel is non-smoking, non-gaming and blissfully quiet. Considering we stayed in the the base level suite, I can only image how beautiful the more expensive rooms are. The suite was beyond spacious, inviting and comfy. The bed was one of the softest we've ever slept in, and the hot tub was huge. The bathroom was very roomy, with two sinks proving most convenient. The lounge room had a large flat screen TV, and all the appliances and fittings in the kitchen were stylish and new. As far as the shared facilities go, special mention must be made of the heated pool, which remains open during winter and is fringed by large deck chairs and lounges. On our first night fire torches were lit outside, adding that extra bit of ambience as we looked on to the strip (it feels like a roop top pool, although it's actually on the fifth floor). The indoors / outdoors nature of the pool area is great, and the public hot tub is also excellent (very warm). There is free wi-fi in the restaurants and also in the pool area. I happened to check in on the eve of my birthday, and within 30 minutes of our arrival the check in staff member had sent a bottle of sparkling wine to the room, which was a nice surprise and a great start to our stay. Room service will bring up basic toiletry items (razors etc) and other things like laundry powder (if you have a washing machine in your room) free of charge. The hotel prides itself on its service and when you do ask for something, they ensure you receive what you need promptly and even ring the room shortly after to ensure you received it. We had a problem with the safe in our room and a staff member was upstairs within five minutes, even refusing a tip when I offered one. I also asked them to arrange our airport shuttle on departure and this was done without a fuss. The gym is very clean and has a great range of equipment for a hotel gym. You really could put in a proper work out there if you desired. We ate at the restaurant once and, being the only ones there, service was prompt and friendly. The food - while not stellar - was decent value. The only negatives were that the on-site day spa is closed several days of the week, and when I did go in to enquire about their services the receptionist was a touch frosty. That was a shame, as the prices seemed low for Vegas and the spa itself looked nice from the reception area. The business centre computer charges are also on the expensive side, and it would've been great to have free wi-fi throughout the hotel. I am already planning to bring a group of friends to Vegas in the future and will certainly be booking rooms at the Platinum Hotel.", "Date": "January 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cleveland", "Title": "\u201cFamily Trip/Swimming Outdoors in Winter?

It was nice to have the mircrowave to reheat as desired throughout the day. I might add that Ellis Island has a great barbeque restaurant and it's a very quick walk around the corner from Platinum. We also used the washer/dryer (they furnished pack of detergent). My mom is a swimmer and really enjoyed the indoor/outdoor pool. The water was really warm (almot too warm) but it was fun to be swimming outdoors in late December with the air temp around 46. The pool is very nice. They have fire pits and plenty of seating. The strip hotels can be seen from this area and it's beautiful in the evening. We spent alot of time (both day and night) swimming. The fitness center had nice equipment and I only saw one other person use the facilities when I was present. Of course I did wake early (6:30am) so I assume most people are not so crazy while in Vegas and would prefer to sleep in. Speaking of sleep, very quiet hotel and peaceful sleeping conditions! Anyone that is coming to Vegas with a family, this is a great place to stay--close enough to the strip, but far enough away from the craziness.

Throughout our stay, all front desk staff and valets greeted us in a friendly manner, and we really liked the personal touch. It was wonderful to return to a more sane, peaceful environment after the hustle and bustle of the Strip, yet it was barely a ten-minute walk away. Granted, as others have mentioned, the vacant lot strewn with beer bottles en route isn't very appealing, but all one has to do is to walk on the other side of the road to avoid it! And we never felt unsafe walking back from the Strip at night. We didn't hear a sound from any other guests during the entire stay, even when it got busy around Christmas Eve! Our suite was on the twelfth floor with a lovely mountain view, which we enjoyed from the balcony. The suite itself had a fully equipped kitchen with breakfast bar, a living room with flatscreen TV, and a separate bedroom with its own TV. as well as a large bathroom with whirlpool and twin sinks. The beds were super comfortable. We encountered a small problem with the kitchen light not switching off, but it was dealt with immediately with a follow-up phone to call to check if it had been satisfactorily resolved, which I thought was a nice touch. My only complaint is that while the bathroom was sparkling, the bedroom and living area didn't look as if they had been thoroughly cleaned prior to our arrival. There was a layer of dust on the coffee maker, the telephone, and the clock radio; and I had barely taken a few steps on the carpet before the bottom of my black socks became totally white --nothing that a good vacuuming wouldn't cure, however.

Located 5 minutes walk east of Bally's and from the monorail at the back of the Flamingo the location was perfect. All of the staff were friendly and helpful, no queues at check in and the rooms were large and spotless. On arrival I mentioned I was here to celebrate my birthday and to my surprise a complimentary bottle of Champagne was delivered to my room 15 minutes after check in (a very nice touch). This was just an example of the superb customer service we received during the whole of our stay. The front desk and concierge staff would go out of their way to be helpful including making reservations for dinner at other hotels despite the fact they had a very acceptable and reasonable restaurant of their own (we ate there 3 times 1 Breakfast a Mid afternoon light meal and once in the evening and on each occasion the food and service was excellent). There is no casino in the hotel but you are only 100 yards away from one if you really need to gamble 24/7. There is however a fully equipped gym, top class Spa offering a wide selection of treatments and a heated swimming pool that is half indoors and half outdoors making it ideal the whole year round. we went swimming in the middle of December and the pool was a really pleasant temperature.

While there were many great things about it, I thought a couple of things were disappointing. If you just want the bullet points: Pros: Huge suites for the money Great location, not far off the strip No smoking or casino Friendly,helpful staff No resort fee Free valet parking (obviously not including tipping) Free wireless internet due to booking online; otherwise you have to pay for it in your room Cons: Other areas of the hotel were a bit weathered Maid service was disappointing as we had to ask daily for things that should have been restocked (see below) Spa not open every day No concierge the whole time we were there The suite: Stayed in the princess suite strip view. At check-in, I asked if we were in one of the upper floors. No, but she easily put us in the 16th out of 17 floors. We had a great suite which was at the end of the hallway. We were never bothered by any noise or other people. In fact, I never saw anyone else up on our floor (or on any of the floors except for the lobby). Great kitchen, full oven/stove, full refrigerator. Also stocked with plates, silverware, etc. No pots and pans, but they'll deliver them if you ask. Small dishwasher which didn't get the dishes incredibly clean. Washer and dryer were very helpful (soap supplied.) Also coffee maker, coffee, etc. Granite countertops and comfortable stools for the counter seating. The living area was nice too with a flat screen TV, fireplace, and balcony. The bedroom was big with another TV in it. (not flatscreen). The bedding was nice enough, but the mattress itself was a bit hard. We asked for more blankets and pillows. The bathroom was huge: double sink, shower, huge bath tub. Also the room was supposed to have robes which we had to call for. The robes were awesome! The lighting in the bathroom was a bit lacking which didn't matter to us, but I know that it does to some people. The suite was over 1100 square feet for about $124 per night. We used to stay at the Signature MGM and the rooms were much smaller and more expensive. The service: Valet guys were very nice. They gave us a ride a couple of times when we asked for a cab (\"as long as you take care of the driver\"). There was often only one front desk person which meant that we had to wait in line about 80% of the time. When calling for something like extra towels, they were very friendly and prompt. They'd almost always call back to make sure that the item had arrived. The room cleaning service was the most disappointing. The bed was made, but often the towels were not restocked (although the used ones were taken away), the dishwasher was not started, and dishes were left in the sink. Coffee and dishwasher soap not restocked either. Although I didn't mind calling for these things, it would have been nice if they would have been here already. Plus, it seemed that there was always the expectation that you tip for them bringing things up which should have already been here. Also, the garbage was not often emptied unless I left it out. My adivce on the missing items: once you arrive, take stock of what you'll need: robes, towels, dishsoap, pots/pans, spatulas, knives, etc. (these were among the items we had to call for). Call once. Daily, as we left we stopped at the front desk to ask for missing items. The pool: Part indoor/part outdoor. We didn't use it, but it looked nice. The workout room: Nice machines. Room itself looked weathered. I used this several times, and there was never anyone else there. Also, the \"complimentary headphones\" were never available. Sanitizer cloths to wipe things down were dried out. Guess no one exercises much here? Overall, we would definitely stay at the Platinum again. If you are looking for someplace very glamorous where you will be constantly catered to, this is probably not the place. However, if you would like the full suite for a good price, off the strip with no casino or smoking, it is perfect. My main disappointment was the inattention to detail when it came to the gym and the room ammenities.

The management (I think his name was Nathan) and front desk did an outstanding job taking care of our bookings for 5+ rooms, despite all of our potentially confusing telephone calls to them (we have too many chiefs and no cooks in our family). The actual stay was really quite perfect- great, easy check-in, friendly and efficient front desk staff (surprising how so many hotels don't have this), spacious rooms with real kitchens you can cook in (instead of \"kitchenettes\" that are meant for looks rather than real cooking), and top-notch housekeeping (I'm a clean-freak, and boy-- housekeeping should be rewarded here because the rooms were super clean despite their large sizes!). Room service was also quite good and affordable. Gorgeous view from the pool area, and especially for the small kids in our group-- it was nice to have indoor and outdoor pool option. The only disadvantage to this pool is that it's not on the strip and not quite close enough to walk if really hot outside, so you'll want a car (which we had- so easy enough) or at least be OK with taking cabs around Vegas. Oh- and if you like parking your own car-- forget it, this hotel is valet-only. So-- just make sure that you give yourselves enough time to get your car and you won't be frustrated. The hotel was quite booked when we stayed but we didn't have any problems with the valet service taking too long. They do work fast there. One final thing- don't even THINK about staying here if you are a smoker. It's a total non-smoking hotel, which is actually the #1 reason why we chose to stay here in the first place. We have babies and toddlers in our group and really liked that the air was clean here. And because of the spacious room sizes with great lay-outs, it was easy for different members of our group to babysit the kids while the other adults went to shows, etc. We hope this place stays competitively priced- because would like to continue staying here for all future visits!", "Date": "November 21, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Denver, Colorado", "Title": "\u201cOur Permanent Hotel Of Choice In Las Vegas\u201d", "Author": "MachineMac", "ReviewID": "UR87689247", "Content": "Wonderful accomodations.

Please read the wonderful reviews about the Platinum Hotel and now that we are home a few days after staying six nights, I will add our review..First, to the people who made our stay so special, I have to mention some names (ala the \"Academy Awards\"): HUGE THANKS to the Platinum Hotel General Manager Dennis Gradillas for the generous guestroom upgrade! Front Office Manager Nathan Rex for arranging the spacious, beautiful Princess Suite w/the private terrace Strip view on the 11th floor, the jacuzzi, fireplace, and the surprise gift of yummy chocolate- covered strawberries and champagne. All of these added to our romantic wedding anniversary celebration! Again thanks to the conscientious concierge Dita for highly recommending and last minute arranging a tour to a hidden gem-amazing, mystical Valley of Fire National Park! Our knowledgeable tour guide Mountain Buck of \"Annie Bananie's Wild West Tours\" made this particular tour far surpass any we have taken anywhere! Appreciation and thanks go to the smart Claire Nagel, office manager, for being so helpful and informative about great restaurants in the area. Many thanks to Barbara, our competent housekeeper who made our suite fresh each day for us! Thanks also goes to Michelle, the nice waitress in Kilowatts Restaurant where we enjoyed delicious breakfasts with a lovely pool view(Strip buildings and mountains in front as a backdrop!)! Thanks to all the friendly valets in the lobby entrance who opened, held the front door, and hailed cabs for us and of course all the other \"behind the scenes\" hard workers who keep the Platinum Hotel in tip- top 5 star shape for us to enjoy! We don't think you can get this level of impeccable and personal service in any mega hotel on the \"Strip\" in Las Vegas! Our feeling is that the Platinum Hotel and Spa's management and employees will try and keep guests extremely satisfied throughout their stay! That is why Platinum Hotel and Spa, you are really worth the 10 minute walk(not that bad a neighborhood- a well-traveled Flamingo Rd.) to the best-located center of the Strip , we found that out by walking through the mega hotels on the Strip, those are even longer walks just to get from your room to the front lobby! Another important perk to mention- NO annoying ala carte Hotel or non-optional \"fees\" to use the Platinum Hotel's up- -to- date gym equipment! So don't hesitate- book this truly quiet Oasis in the land of Las Vegas Overwhelming smoky Casino Hotels! We would definitely return and stay at the Platinum Hotel and Spa anytime! P.S.Also for gambling , we advise the small Tuscany Suites and Casino just east (next door on Flamingo) of Platinum Hotel for some actual winning slot action!", "Date": "October 8, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Canberra, Australia", "Title": "\u201cFantastic!!\u201d", "Author": "Aussie_traveller032", "ReviewID": "UR82130862", "Content": "Great place to stay in Las Vegas.

The bedroom has two double beds, another tv, plenty of cupboard space. The bathroom has a double Jacuzzi bath and a separate walk in shower and his and hers washbasins.

We have the privacy of our own hotel (we had no casino or nightclub, which means we had no flow of people coming in and out) - also in Vegas hotels are quite a walk apart. So either way you are going to walk lots! Which means the fact we were a block away didn't really make much difference. Our room was IMMENSE!!!!! Suite - kitchen, living room, bedroom and bathroom (shower, 2 sinks, toilet and a whirlpool bath!) - Best room i've ever stayed in. Bargain price too!!!! (I booked with ASDA Travel) Staff were good also - as it's off strip the cabs are a bit harder to get but the porter will nip out into the sun and get you one which means you can appreciate the air con a bit more! Also on our last day they got us the hotel car to take us to the airport rather than get a taxi - that means you just pay what you think is right.

This was our first time to Las Vegas. There was a slight problem checking in; the hotel could only charge his card for one night of a 4 night stay (8/30-9/03) and needed a copy of his card to charge the rest. This might have been a problem since he is in the military and not always easy to get a hold of. Nathan Rex, the mgr. on duty, emailed him and took care of the whole thing for us. Then they had a bottle of champagne and a plate of the most delicious chocolate covered strawberries delivered to our room to make up for the problem. The room was the most beautiful room we have every stayed in. We had a Princess Suite on the top floor (rm. 1715). The view at night was spectacular. We got some great pics of the strip. There was a table and 4 chairs on the balcony. We could also see the strip from our bedroom, which had a king size bed that was so comfortable, we almost didn't get up after a nap to go out to the strip. The sheets were so soft. The bathroom was pure luxury. First there are double sinks with granite countertops, a beautiful shower with a rain showerhead and then the two person jacuzzi tub. The kitchen was top of the line granite and stainless steel and all you need is right there. That opens onto a huge living area with a flat screen tv over an electric fireplace. The balcony opens off of the living area. I can't stress enough how clean this room was! We did eat at breakfast there and it was quite good and reasonable. The pool is great. You can swim from the outdoor side into the indoor pool, but that was a little chilly from the a/c. Plenty of outdoor beds to lie in and you can use the phone there to call in your order if you would like food or drink. The only drawback to this hotel is the location. The walk to the strip was a bit much for us. I have serious back problems and the walk did take us 20mins each way. One evening we needed a cab to go to Fremont St. and the doorman couldn't get one for us, so he offered to take us in the hotel car. The next night, we asked if he could run us up to the strip and he did. (Didn't mind giving a tip for such great service.) In the morning, they had cabs waiting to take you to the airport. Both the AM/PM mini market and the 7/11 are right next door. So is the Ellis Island Casino and behind the hotel is the Tuscany hotel and casino, so you don't need to walk to the strip for gambling. This hotel is on Flamingo Avenue, so when you walk straight up to the strip Bally's is on the left and Bill's Gambling Hall and The Flamingo are on the right. I would highly recommend this hotel. It may not be in the middle of the strip, but you can take a cab up to it and the room is absolutely gorgeous for such a reasonable price.

So we gave it a shot..Compared to the $500 a night we had just experienced we were still hesitant... We took a cab from the Bellagio to the Platinum($9) and yes its off the strip(not quite way off) but not so far off that you cant simply walk the very very long block to the strip(less not forget the heat(115 average we we were there and humid(not typical) but it was)...or you could always just cross the street and take the monorail which stops inside the Bally's..mind you there was no signage for this inside the hotel or outside the hotel..so Google and Jesus helped us find the fairly priced monorail... Back to the hotel, first impression, this place is new and while from the outside not super uber fabulously flamboyant like the rest of Vegas, it looks strong and beefy like something you would find in a earthquake zone better said, like a made to last upscale NYC apt building..the driver pulled up to the entrance where you could see the valet's hustling to move some cars into the valet only parking lot..so much so they were no where to be scene for luggage assist(but then again, I could carry the 2 carry-ons myself and didn't feel as if I needed to tip for this, so..) The lobby feels more modern than the outside and the staff was very pleasant as expected. We checked in early(2pm) and thus no wait..went up to the very large room(princess suite) and just WOW unbelievable.. ...the suite was the slightly higher princess and was not in front of the hotel but wow..you even get the impression that if the hotel thing doesn't workout they will sell these off as higher end condominiums(each room has individual breaker, heat, air, etc setup..yes I looked) the list of amenities is ridiculous...fireplace, washer/dryer, 55\" mounted/swiveling flat screen, an abundance of channels(abundant by any hotel standards), Free High-speed internet(free w/online booking), full balcony with patio table and chairs, separate living room(sofa, love-seat, desk), full kitchen, bathroom with separate shower and spa tub etc etc...just amazing especially considering we had just left the Bellagio where something remotely like this would have cost several thousand per night...the fridge was immaculate as were the stove and everything else..they even include cookware, utensils and other kitchen like amenities..oddly enough no vending machines that I could see..so had to go outside to get some food supplies..we did change rooms 20 minutes later after deciding we wanted a strip view..the front desk lady was very accommodating and helped us get moved within the hour(when a room was available) no problem..We ordered room service for dinner and the service and food were quick and really good..unlike house keeping which seems slow as if they have maybe 1 or 2 persons(that day..sat) even though we didn't need it..Overall the staff seemed sparse..Our tray from room service literally sat outside our room for a day+ and i said nothing, trying to see when it would disappear(never did)..aside from that the pool was smaller(not tiny) and cozy with lots of chairs and seating and umbrellas..and very quiet as if no one really used it, a fluke perhaps.. The one bad thing, yet a good thing is the price point...its soo low for the area that it tends to draw a particular younger(crowd) that i'm sure during the week is non-existent but on the weekends(especially at night) they're everywhere...thus I noticed the increased amount of plain clothed(black suits)security..this seemed more of a deterrent for the drinking bunch and not for any other reason. But at times there was some noise in and out elevator and in halls but it was always passing and nothing really to complain about..never felt unsafe or remotely un-secured, just not the case..very modern, very clean, very secure feeling throughout... As to the area, well its in development..this is what I believe most of Vegas must have looked like at some point over the last 20 years when a new hotel was in construction..literally right in front of the hotel is a gas station and a 7 eleven, across the street( in front there appears to be a very large old parking lot/development space)..(on the right side is a small transformer(not the robot) power plant), behind the hotel is another family friendly 4 story villa type Howard Johnson-ish hotel..on the left is the pool setup which is tastefully setup in front of the hotel restaurant(all of which is elevated about 6 stories up and sits on top of the hotel parking garage(you would truly never know this)...this perspective from the strip view... The surrounding area feels like it should be sketchy because the hotel is mostly alone amongst some empty development, 2 gas stations, 7 eleven and 2 hotels...but really its not, surprisingly enough there's foot traffic on the walk (where it gets and can feel really lonely) at night going towards the Ballys for the monorail..but again area is development..You almost get the feeling that the Platinum developers have first dibs on the immediate gas station property in front of the hotel should they ever go bust... All in all this place is beyond fabulous, a diamond amongst zirconias and arguably the best family affordable hotel in Vegas. I don't expect there rates to stay this low forever, the hotel is still new, with some popularity and good word of mouth, I see price increases in the future...if your not into gambling, partying, drinking, etc..and no that's not sarcasm..Vegas is an adult city but not all adults want to be constantly surrounded by slot machines, vendors, bars, clubs, unspeakable busyness/loudness(and I'm from NY) and no this not a Buddhist thing, just a \"I likes me quiet time thing\"...this is the place for you..once you get past the I have to walk, cab or monorail to the strip thing..you'll find that you have hit it bigger than anyone else staying Vegas...seriously PS I do not normally write reviews but in this case much is to be said...and I wish i had more information about this place prior to...would have been less hesitant to book..", "Date": "September 4, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tampa, Florida", "Title": "\u201cApartment home close to the Vegas Strip!!\u201d", "Author": "NanaBeeTampa_Florida", "ReviewID": "UR78168307", "Content": "We selected the Platinum Hotel and Spa based on other reviews from this Trip Advisor website.

The price of the room!! Amazing Value!! I booked a 21-day non-refundable room rate and made a slight error which Claire helped me with. Upon arrival at the hotel we had been upgraded to a Strip View Princess Suite which was 1,150sq ft. Huge!! The suite comprised of fully functioning kitchen, with oven, hob, fridge/freezer, microwave, dishwasher and coffee machine. Crockery, Glassware and Cutlery/Utensils were all provided but if you wanted pots and pans you had to request from \"Service One\". Lounge comprised of fireplace and 48\" plasma TV as well as balcony area and washing/drying cupboard with complimentary washing detergent. Bedroom was very roomy with the usual requirements and bathroom was amazing!! Twin tub with whirpool, shower and twin sinks for washing which really sped things along. \"Service One\" system failed the hotel as often the hotel operator/staff didn't know the answers to your questions. Frustratingly, there is no guest services directory in the room which could have answered the questions I had. Phone calls from the room to local or toll-free were exorbitent when compared to chain hotels. So didn't bother. Loved the pool area, some areas of shade (particularly in the morning) but afternoon it does become a bit of a sun trap. However there are automatic sunblinds/canopys that come out if you just ask \"Service One\" or you can swim/walk through to the indoor pool area which keeps you nice and cool. The pool was a good temperature as was the spa pool. If you want any pool service you do have to call service one, so we didn't bother, but compared to other Las Vegas hotels, no room key no entry. Really enjoyed my stay at Las Vegas because of this hotel, was really great to get away from the chaos of the strip, and would certainly stay here again on my next trip.

Our suite on 14th floor had a good view of the Strip (we booked a Strip-view Princess Suite) from the bedroom window and from the balcony accessed from the living room. My sister was also staying in a Solitaire Suite at the same time, the only differences between the Princess and the Solitaire Suites that I could see were that the Princess Suite was slighly larger and contained a clothes washing machine and a tumble dryer (one sachet of washing powder and two dryer softening sheets provided, additional free supplies also available on request). The washing machine and dryer were a godsend after two weeks on the road in Utah and Arizona. The Suite had a fully equipped kitchen with large fridge/freezer (with ice maker), dishwasher, full cooker/hob, microwave oven, coffee maker, toaster, kettle (useful if you like tea!), crockery/cutlery/glasses/cooking utensils and granite worktops. The washing machine and tumble dryer are housed in a cupboard. In the living area there is a sofa, desk, large flatscreen TV, Bose CD player/radio, fireplace and patio doors to the balcony which has a table and four chairs. The bedroom had 2 queen beds, a TV, radio, safe and telephone. The bathroom is very large with 2 sinks, a walk-in shower, large jacuzzi bath, hairdryer and bathrobes. Suite is air conditioned throughout of course. There is no free internet access in the suites (it costs $2.99 for 2 hours of $9.99 for 24 hours) but is free in the lobby and by the pool on the 5th floor. The location of the hotel was fine for us, a short walk to the Strip made easier as you can walk all the way through Ballys Hotel (one block) which is also directly connected inside to Paris, Las Vegas both of which provide direct access to the Strip. We used the pool, it doesn't have the same atmosphere as some of the larger Las Vegas hotel pools but was a nice place to relax in the sun and cool down in the water; there is a also an indoor pool directly connected to the outdoor pool if you want to swim out of the sun.", "Date": "August 14, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Phoenix, Arizona", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel - except for the staff!\u201d", "Author": "marae87", "ReviewID": "UR75087927", "Content": "I booked this hotel for my wedding, and had all the wedding party staying there. Loved the location - close enough to the strip for walking but far enough from the chaos of casinos. I booked these rooms well in advance and all together - my husband and I were paying for all the rooms, but they made us put down names of the guests staying in them which is fine. We wanted to check in all the rooms prior to our friends arrivals since they would all be arriving at different times and we didn't want them having troubles checking in. I left keys at the front desk for two of my friends. When they arrived the front desk told them they could let them check into the room and we had about five very confusing phone conversations between our friends, and different workers. Finally they allowed them in. (The next morning I saw the packet with the keys with their names written on them sitting on the front desk....must of gotten misplaced?). The staff wasn't particularly helpful or friendly to anyone all weekend. They also split all of the rooms up - a room on every floor - instead of grouping them together (since we were a wedding party) like asked. Very weird. I will say the valets and bellman were exceptional - if all their staff worked as hard and were as nice as them it would be a superb hotel. The two times we went to the pool and ordered drinks by the time we got the drinks (I'd say 30+ minutes of waiting) we had to take them to go since we were in a time crunch. Since there were probably only 20 people at the pool, I didn't think it would take 30 minutes for a drink. I only recommend this hotel because the rooms are awesome, especially if you are traveling with kids. Loved the full kitchen.

My wife and I were especially impressed with ability of the air conditioning system to drop the room temperature in a flash. When we requested extra towels, cooking equipment or info on other hotels the staff was prompt, courteous and more than helpful. We did not try the restaurant but while out for a morning swim in their indoor-outdoor pool, I noticed a couple of ladies having breakfast brought out to them poolside. The omlete looked well portioned and the standard breakfast seemed very adequate. An easy 10 minute walk and your at the intersection of the Bellagio, Ceasar's Palace, Bally's and the Flamingo. There is a monorail stop in the back of the Flamingo which can zoom you down to Mandalay Bay or up to the Stratosphere, which is even closer. All in all, this hotel is for the person that wants to experience Las Vegas up to 16 hours a day. The town is crazy and people everywhere.

Since our flight out was at 11PM this worked out perfect for us as we only needed to buy two nights instead of three. Arrival: I am familialr with the area and remember this place being built so it was easy for me to find. Upon arrival we were met quickly by the valet (it is vale only for parking) and equilly as quickly we were checked in by a very friendly check in person that explained the property etc and told us our room was upgraded to a high room with a view of the strip. The room: Well, you have seen pictures already and they are all accurate. The room is clean and nice and BIG. I dont cook when I am traveling but this place has a great kitchen with everything you would need to put a meal together. The living area has a LCD tv and couche and chair etc. The bedroom is similar to what you would find in a standard hotel with a bed, chair and tv and a couple of nightstands. The bathroom is huge! It has the jacuzzi big enough for two medium sized folks and one if you are a person of size and it fills up qick and has good enough pressure on the jets. I like having a seperate shower also and of course double sinks with plenty of counter space. Also, there are lots of closet space with is nice. One of the best things for me though is a balcony as I love to sit out on the balcony at night. Restuarant: We only dined at the restaurant Kil@wat (I think I spelled that right) for breakfast and it was great. I hate buffets that you get at a lot of hotels and I hate even more bad hurried service and this place has personal and unrused service. Sit there and drink coffee till you explode if you want to. Very nice ladies working the breakfast area. I also thought the prices were reasonable. You can find the menu online. The people working the restauant also work the pool area so take your breakfast out at the pool for a really nice relaxing breakfast. Bar: We did not try the bar area at the lobby level called Stir but it looked like a nice place to have a drink and I know they do have a happy hour so if you are here on biz this could be a nice place to chill and finish up some work and have a drink a meal (I am assuming you can get food). The place was never really that busy. Valet: Ok, let me start off by telliing you that I hate valet services. It is not that I mind tipping but I hate waiting for my car when I can just go get the thing myself in half the time. We did have to wait sometimes and had trouble finding an attendant at times but it was nothing serious so I am not saying they were terrible just gets a little quiet there sometimes so I think they get lost sometimes. It is valet only here and no charge. Internet: It is free at the restaurant and pool on the 5th floor and the lobby and lobby bar. In the room it is $9.95 per 24hours for wifi from your room and same for wired. Our wired access did not work so not sure if that is the same for all rooms. They do seem to limit the internet speeds by session if that is important to you (if you work in tech like I do) but I understand why they do this but it is frustrating if you need to download a large file etc Location: Ok, I know everyone says this location is sooo close to the strip and although it is close....a block in Vegas is much different than a block in NYC. If it is 110 degrees outside it can be a long walk to the strip. I suggest going into the Bally's sports book and walking through Bally's to reach the strip. It is not a five minute walk at all. The only time I dislike making the walk is when I have had a few and then it is a taxi. It is about $5 taxi from Caesars. I like the location but I want people to understand it is not a quick stroll to the strip. Pool: I really liked the pool. It was busy but not so busy that you could not find a decent seat. It does not get sun early but there is sun in the afternoon for those that want to bake. Nice jacuzzi with strong jets and there is rarely anyone at the indoor pool so you can head in there and get some short laps if you like. Most strip hotels that pool is so busy you cant find a spot to lay out and that is not the case with this place and that is a big plus. Would I recommend this place to a friend? Absolutely.

After enduring the super-crowded pool area, walking through the smoky casino, and paying exorbitant prices for substandard pool-side food, we escaped to the relaxing and smoke-free Platinum Hotel. I had booked one night at the strip Mirage hotel, and two nights at the Platinum Hotel. Although the Mirage was conveniently located on the strip (and the rooms were nicely renovated and discounted), we DEFINITELY enjoyed our stay at the Platinum better! It was such a pleasure to have all the space (especially since we were with young kids), full workable kitchen, FANTASTIC housekeeping services (and I am a clean-freak), and no casino with smoke and noise pollution (we weren't there to gamble- just to see shows). The pool was simple, yet wonderfully uncrowded- loved the patio furniture. Although the room had a nice strip view, my toddler son was most enamored with the view of the monorail- he loves trains! The room service was efficient, the food was delicious, and the prices were reasonable (not cheap- but not stupidly expensive like the strip hotels-- they were priced just right so that we were inclined to use them despite having a full kitchen). I liked the free internet in the bar and pool area. The icing on the cake? Well, I didn't tell them that we were there to celebrate my husband's birthday, but the front desk person who checked my husband's ID at check-in must have noticed that it was his birthday, because when we returned from lunch, there was a delectable plate of chocolate-covered strawberries and a nice note from management wishing him a happy birthday! The only negative was the valet service. For the most part, they were great- but one guy was TERRIBLE in his attitude. He was so rude that it could have colored our experience and ruined it for us but I was able to ignore his misbehavior (although I saw another couple who was really turned off by his yelling and rude behavior). Thankfully, we only saw him a couple of times. Because of our great experience, I've convinced my family to celebrate our parents' anniversary there this upcoming weekend! Hopefully, it will be just as good of an experience.

We didn\u2019t want to get stuck at the end of the Strip, like MGM or Mandalay or TI, because the walk would\u2019ve been terrible. Even though the Platinum isn\u2019t on the Strip, the walk is not that bad, because it is only about 10 minutes to Las Vegas Blvd (and even closer if you cut through Bally\u2019s). If you need a cab, the valets easily flag one down for you, and there is no long wait (like other hotels). We\u2019ve never heard about this place, but based on reviews on TripAdvisor, we had high expectations for the Platinum. The hotel definitely exceeded anything we had expected. For a busy holiday weekend, the Platinum was the best choice for us, because after partying and clubbing, we were able to return to a nice, quiet room. The non-gaming, non-smoking was a plus for me. The full-kitchen had appliances that looked and worked like new. We were able to store drinks in the fridge with an ice dispenser (VERY CONVENIENT!), boil hot water on the electric stove, microwave food, and had plenty of utensils and dishes for dining and glasses for drinking. The living room area was spacious and had a pull-out sofa. We also had a balcony, which overlooked the Strip. It was amazing, considering we had a great view of the fireworks show from Caesar\u2019s Palace and was able to avoid the crowd that gathered in the street. The balcony had a table and chairs, so we were able to sit out and drink and just enjoy the fireworks in our own privacy. Even without a view of the strip, we were told we could watch the show from the pool or the rooftop, which they opened specifically for the event. The bathroom was HUGE. There were his and hers sinks and a standing shower, plus a giant whirlpool tub big enough for two people to lay side by side. There was a bathroom closet in addition to a closet in the bedroom. There were also two entrances to the bathroom, one from the living room and one from the bedroom. That way, people staying in the living room could have access to the bathroom without walking through the bedroom. The suite was very spacious and clean. Also helpful was that it was almost soundproof. When we closed the door to the bedroom, the tv playing in the living was almost negligible. For those that need internet, there is free wi-fi by the pool and at the bar. Not to mention, the service here was amazing. Everyone, from the valet, the front desk, room service and poolside service, were friendly and helpful. The gym was state-of-the-art. The pool was average, but still nice with a firepit as well. The prices were especially reasonable. Where else can you order beer for $4 and a chicken quesadilla for $8 POOLSIDE?? They even let us bring our own drinks to the pool, which other hotels would never allow you to do. They even had spa services that had decent pricing which I would have loved to try, but just didn\u2019t have enough time. The Platinum made this trip to Vegas the best I ever had. For a holiday weekend, I was expecting to deal with crowds and long waits, but staying here I was able to avoid all of that! The walk may be a bit of a hindrance, but all the perks of the hotel make you completely overlook that one minor thing. I would love to stay here again. I can\u2019t believe I never knew about this place before. It is an amazing find! I wish I could keep it all to myself, but I can\u2019t stop telling people about my great experience here!", "Date": "July 7, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Winnpeg, MB", "Title": "\u201cWonderful oncde again!!!!!\u201d", "Author": "bartondarr", "ReviewID": "UR69827952", "Content": "This is the 4th time coming back to the Platinum, and love it!

We now have a 1 year old and found that staying in a standard Vegas hotel room was no longer an option for us. What attracted us to Platinum was the fact that it was non-smoking and non-gaming ... a better environment for our daughter to be in. We figured that 11 years of staying where we wanted was good enough for us. This trip was also partly business in Henderson and we had a car, so the need to stay on Strip just wasn't there either. Upon arrival we found the valet staff fantastic! They were very attentive and very prompt. As we were staying for two weeks (with a weekend break in better), they got to know us, and more importantly, they got to know our daughter and just loved greeting her back each time. The first room we were given was on the 16th floor, unfortunately you can hear the airconditioners on top of the hotel which made this constant buzzing sound. We asked to be moved and were given a Strip view room on the 6th floor. The only set back with this room was the fact that the pool is on the 5th floor and when there is a function you sure can hear it. Luckily the only function was a wedding on our first night and it ended at midnight. The sound was nearly unbearable, but short-lived. The customer service at this hotel is second to none. When we had a request - whether it be housekeeping or maintenance, we were seen to promptly and a call from the front desk always followed to ensure our requirements were met. The room itself was huge. We had a princess suite as we thought the washer/dryer would be handy (which it was). It was a real benefit to have the separate bedroom/living area and 2-way bathroom - particularly with such a young child going to sleep quite early. Our daughter had a lot of fun running around the apartment opening doors, turning on the bath taps and hiding in drawers (we really didn't need to bring her any toys)! The only set back with the room was the bed, it wasn't very comfortable and quite squeeky. One of the benefits of the larger/newer hotels (ie Wynn), the beds are sooooooooooooo comfortable! The kitchen is large, well equipped and very handy (especially with a young one) and you are supplied with all your cleaning needs - washing power, washing liquid, dishwasher tablets etc. We found Platinum to be our home away from home and will highly recommend it to anyone - whether you are in town for business, pleasure or with a young family. It was a nice change to be off the Strip, but still close enough to walk it quite easily (10 minutes to Planet Hollywood). Don't let the \"valet only\" service deter you, these guys have a system and they are fast! We never waited more than 5 minutes for our car, even less if we called down before! They run a very tight ship at Platinum and we can now see why they get such great reviews!

Most staff we personally dealt with were exceptional, including the valets, but I was a little disappointed with the cleanliness.

The staff was extremely friendly, either during check-in/out, or merely making conversation in the elevator.

The beds?...Like being back in the womb... The separation of the bedroom from the bath and living room allowed one of us to sleep in while the other got the day going with breakfast and coffee on the balcony. The grocery store was a mile walk and made using the kitchen easy. As the hotel was a 5 minute walk from the strip, it was a great place to get away from the sensory overload of lights, sounds and smoke. One of the best evenings was sitting by the gas fireplace at the pool, sipping a beer and relaxing...a pool that you did not have to pay an additional $20 to enjoy. If we had one complaint, it was the business center: Internet was charged by the minute and the airline check in kiosk was a per use charge as well. I can understand that hotels need to generate revenue. However, perhaps a five minute daily comp to check e-mail or print a boarding pass would be nice.

One of the reasons we chose this hotel was because it is a non-gambling, non-smoking hotel (unlike most, if not all, of Vegas). This hotel is in such a great location though (about 2 blocks from the Strip), that it was great to be able to explore the Strip all day and night, but then only be a short distance away from our no smoke and no slot machine sanctuary! However, upon arriving at our room, it was clear by the number of cigarette butts on and over our balcony that alot of guests don't abide by this no-smoking policy. Our room was great - each of the room were large, the king size bed was very comfortable, it had 2 TVs, a self contained kitchen, the bathroom was huge, and it had a washing machine as well. Having said all that though, we weren't all that impressed with the service/front desk staff at this hotel. It appears to be the sort of hotel that isn't sure what it is - it tries to cater for business travellers, but then it also tries to cater for honeymooners like us, as well as young people - without really having the level of service to satisfy anyone. There were a few occasions where we found the front desk staff to be generally unhelpful and unresponsive to our queries, and the service in the restaurant/bar was also very average. Unfortunately they only had one poor girl serving a bar the night we were in there, and she was struggling to cope. At first we put this down to the teething problems of a new hotel, but then we were told by a doorman that the hotel had been running for 2 years! As an aside, one night we took the sunset helicopter tour of the grand canyon and Strip - which we would HIGHLY RECOMMEND. Overall, the rooms at this hotel were very nice and spacious, and the hotel was in a very good location.

It's only a short walk to the strip; maybe a 7-10 minute walk to Caesar's Palace or the Bellagio. Bally's is only about 5 minutes away. What a great place and experience! We were initially attracted by the good reviews, and the fact that it is a non-gaming and non-smoking hotel (bonus!), but the room, service, and amenities far surpassed anything I would have expected.

We got our key and headed to our room, only to find a set of double doors leading into our room. We entered the room, and we immediately felt like we won the jackpot!

For example, a very good breakfast sandwich with 2 eggs, ham, and cheese on a croissant was $5. Their lounge, Stir, was excellent as well, with an inexpensive happy hour. The staff was fantastic as well. I wish I could remember the name of the gentleman that checked us in when we arrived, but he was very professional and friendly. At the time of checkout, Brianna was very helpful, and she offered to check us into our returning flight, and she printed out our boarding passes.

First impression of the suite was large, bright, tastefully decorated, very large flat screen TV above the fireplace, massive bathroom with an excellent shower and soaker tub, and clean. We made use of the modern kitchen facility and the laundry - everything worked well. The front desk was very responsive to any needs that we had, from calling for our car to requesting a late made service to finding extra dishes. The two queen beds were excellent and we all had great sleeps. The shower is a separate, walk-in style with a large glass door and a powerful showerhead. My wife loved the large, thick and fluffy bath towels that were always replenished when requested. Only criticisms have been mentioned before and they are the distance away from the strip and the outside noise (E. Flamingo Rd. must be on a ambulance/fire route). However, I will say this - we expected to walk. And when you consider the walk from the MGM to Treasure Island, the short walk from the Platinum to Bally's (strip) is minor. Even with children, we did not find it unsafe to walk on Flamingo Rd. Finally, when sitting on the balcony enjoying the lights of Vegas it was a little noisy for a property off the strip; however, the hotel had very good windows and there was no problem sleeping. As an aside, we found the entire hotel to be very quiet but we were there early in the week and not on the weekend. All in all, my expectations were exceeded by this property. I would come back again in a heartbeat and would strongly recommend it to anyone who doesn't mind the quiet nature of the hotel (no casino) and its location (one block E of the Strip).", "Date": "April 11, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "cumbria,england", "Title": "\u201cWow!Amazing accommodation and great service!\u201d", "Author": "tuichic", "ReviewID": "UR60900384", "Content": "As a travel agent,I carefully picked this accommodation since I was travelling with a young family and wanted to be able to escape the hectic Strip and have plenty of space in our room to relax in.

I had never heard of the hotel, however I had been looking at the MGM Signature and found the Platinum\u2019s description to be superior. I decided to take a chance and booked the hotel looking forward to St. Paddy\u2019s day week and hopefully a fantastic time.I was not disappointed. We rented a car at the airport and drove to the hotel a little worn out from the long trip. The portable GPS we brought with us made finding the Platinum a snap. Coming down Las Vegas Blvd from the south it\u2019s just behind Bally\u2019s and a couple of blocks from the strip. It\u2019s a very convenient location actually. Far enough from the strip to be away from the large crowds and noise, but close enough to access it quite easily. A monorail station is located in Bally\u2019s which can take you as far as the MGM Grand and the Deuce bus stops in front of the Flamingo nearby.When we drove up the valets were there right away. They were super efficient and polite and made an effort to learn our names. Whenever we needed our car it only took moments for one of the valets to retrieve it. We never had to wait long even during the busy times.The front desk clerk was very friendly and polite and upon learning it was my birthday the following day, upgraded us to an amazing suite with a stripview on the 17th floor. We were very grateful as it was an amazing suite. Our first morning we noticed that there were no bathrobes in the bathroom , so I let the front desk know and they assured me that someone would put them in the room later on in the day. We were on our way out to drive to the Grand Canyon. On our arrival back that night, the bathrobes had indeed been brought up as promised.In my opinion the reality was even better than I had expected. We opened the door to a 1150 sq ft one bedroom suite on the top floor which overlooked the pool and the casinos along the strip. The suite was supplied with an oversize whirlpool tub, king bed, 42\u201d plasma TV in the living room and a smaller TV in the bedroom. It also had a washer and dryer with soap and fabric softener supplied. A stainless steel fridge with an icemaker and a stove with oven dominated the kitchen. Past the granite countertops were a microwave oven and all the kitchen utensils necessary to eat and drink with. The bathroom in addition to the enormous tub also sported a glass enclosed granite shower, two sinks and a separate closet. The other closet was located in the bedroom. The Platinum has a pool on the fifth floor which was adequate for the number of guests staying at the hotel at the time. The pool staff were very helpful and attentive and the Kil@wat restaurant offered great value and quality for the price. We had the chicken pesto burger with fries which was delicious. A convenience store right next door to the Platinum sold beer which we could enjoy cold in our room and Elis Island close-by has a pizza place that makes a perfect pizza for those late nights when most of the restaurants have closed in the casinos. It also has a microbrewery and cheap beer. I noticed a lot of locals frequenting the place.The atmosphere and friendliness of the staff at the platinum made our stay there a pleasure. It was a perfect retreat from the craziness of the strip at the end of the day and a wonderful environment to unwind in.

There is a giant flatscreen over the fireplace so you can watch movies or the game. The bathrooms are new construction with granite, great showers and a huge spa tub. Our rooms looked over the pool and hot tub on the fifth floor below - which looked great but we didn't use it because we were too busy betting on the tournament. Because of the space, the Platinum would be a perfect place to hang out with a large group of friends or bring your kids. Having a working kitchen (with plates, cookware, glasses and everything else included) really provides flexibility for your group. The location is about a five to six minute walk to the heart of the strip. If you are worried about this being an issue - you shouldn't be. We grabbed a drink at the store next door and walked to the casinos with no problem. You can't beat this hotel and I can't wait to come back next year.

Valet Parking - Staying for business training in Las Vegas can be a hassle if you stay elsewhere and have a car, but the quick and efficient complimentary valet parking was a key asset to this hotel. The men were courteous, helpful and never expected a tip although I did anyway since they truly hustled to get your car and keep the patrons moving. Thank you Donn and Julian for excellent service. Hotel - Clean and well maintained. None of the room service remnants in the halls like you see at so many other places. There was night roadwork going on in the front of the hotel during my stay so that was a bit distracting since the hotel itself is very quiet on the floors. The room was extremely spacious and I loved being able to sit on the balcony in the evenings to people watch and get some fresh air. The kitchen was very well appointed and I felt guilty not using it, but it would be great for a family to save some money by eating in here. This is actually a perfect hotel for families with no smoking, no gambling and plenty of room space. Location - Very easy access on the corner of Koval and E Flamingo Road but it is a bit of a walk to the strip as a solo female and I did not feel safe doing so alone and elected to drive up to the strip and park in self-park at various hotels to walk around there. When I go back I would ask for a room on the side facing Koval/Strip side if on the lower levels since the lower levels on E Flamingo face the electric substation which is not such a great view and more street noise. Otherwise the view from probably 5th floor and above would be comparable from anywhere I would think. Pool/Hot Tub - Loved this setup with the indoor/outdoor heated pool surrounded by comfortable lounge seats and couched seating areas surrounding fire pits. Plenty of places to stretch out. Very clean and warm even for March which still has cold nights. The hot tub was well maintained and clean as well with some seriously powerful jets and plenty of space for sitting and meeting new people. Would have liked to have seen the waitress more often and have her actually acknowledge me on at least one pass by my chair. When I finally hailed her to order a drink she forgot about me and a gentleman in the hot tub had to remind her about my order. Not too impressed with the wait staff up at the pool, more interested in the large groups of \"men\" than actually attending to patrons. Restaurant/Bar - Thank you to bartender Dale at Stir for great service and keeping the quiet bar interesting in conversation on St. Patty's Day. The food was presented well and served with a smile but it was only OK and nothing to write home about for dinner. Did love the creme brulee for dessert though! Breakfasts were very good at Kilawat and the hostess was perfect for the job, very friendly and inviting. Well Spa - Yep, I took advantage of everything this hotel had to offer and really loved the Spa for a 50 minute Swedish Massage. Tracey did an excellent job and the whole experience was very relaxing. Would have liked to have spent more time to enjoy the steam room and lounge area but ran out of time that day. My only change would be to remove the piano soundtrack from the massage rooms, each time that set of songs cycled through it built up such a crescendo in the music that it was not necessarily restful, although the other tracks were very pleasant. Overall it was my favorite hotel experience in Las Vegas. If you are looking for something well appointed and not a haven for Spring Break raucousness than this is the place for you. If you are looking to be a party animal and rock out at your hotel, there are plenty of other choices to consider elsewhere. For business travelers, couples looking to enjoy the strip but have a relaxing hotel to rest or a family looking to have space then this is the right spot.

The bathroom has a HUGE two person whirlpool tub, which after walking almost a marathon daily on the strip was a nice perk to come home too to sooth your weary bones. The shower is very nicely appointed and roomy with a \"rain\" style showerhead.

We had a mountain view (not strip) and this didn't really matter to us or make a big difference. GYM: I used the gym one day (state of the art) a good selection of equipment and four flat screen TV's to choose from for your viewing pleasure.

In fact, TripAdvisor reviews of Ellis Island place it in the top 20 restaurants in Vegas. The hotel is especially convenient if you have a car. Rental cars in Vegas cost less than we would have spent on taxis or the tram ($13 a day per person), and almost everywhere in Vegas has free self-parking available. Some reviewers have complained about the mandatory complimentary valet parking. I asked why self-parking was not an option and was told that the parking garage has sharp turns that some people would find difficult to navigate. Our experience with the valets was very positive. On the Saturday night before St. Patrick's Day, the hotel was packed and everybody seemed to be going or coming at the same time. The valets fell a little behind then, but otherwise they were available and fast whenever we needed them. They did not seem to be looking for tips, but they did appreciate it when they were given. One suggestion. We paid a little more for Strip view rooms, which was nice, but if I was going to be there in hot weather, I would opt for the other side to have shade, rather than sun on the balcony in the afternoon.

Bathroom also was HUGE with a shower and a jacuzzi tub (that three girls fit in comfortably at once... but that is another story) AND a separate shower, as well as a two sinks with a huge mirror... it was very easy for all six of us to get ready at the same time. Kitchen was huge (big double door refrigerator with ice machine, full sized oven, silverware and stemware for 4) and had a nice bar with stools. The room initially only had enough towels for four people, but housekeeping quickly brought us three more as soon as we asked. The restaurant in the lobby does 1/2 off drinks and appetizers from 5-7 every night. Three of us each had 2 vodka tonics, one meal, and we shared 1 appetizer... I paid a total of $14 not including tip! Grocery and liquor store was a quick cab ride away which was great for stocking up on food to save money all week. Pool area is very classy, quiet, and well-kept. Overall, the hotel surpassed all of my expectation and is just far enough off the strip so that you hear absolute nothing! We didn't even hear the other guests for the duration of our stay.

Breakfast service through the restaurant and room services was extremely slow and at times no one was around but they still expected a tip at the end of the meal. Fitness center is nice but several machines were broken during our stay. Valet parking is nice and free but get ready to tip, every time you take your car out. On one night our heater went out and when we tried to call the front desk no one answered the phone for ten minutes and it took almost two hours for someone to come to the room and fix the problem. At check out our card was charged a wrong amount and two weeks later were still trying to get someone from the hotel to respond to our request for assistance to get it fixed.

We had a huge flat screen TV in the living room, a big one in the bedroom, a nice balcony, and a Bose stereo! The bathroom was flawless! So clean, with marble, and a seperate spa tub! They offer a good happy hour in the Stir lounge on the first floor. Great prices and food (esp. the spinach and artichoke dip). There was a minus at Stir. The waitress was very nice, but clueless about cocktails. They appeared to be short staffed in this area. I tried to book a last minute massage, but they were booked up. They only offer spa service from 9-5 Thursday-Sunday. There is only valet parking. They were fast and courteous. A cab ride to the strip was about 7-10 dollars depending on traffic.

Matt at the front desk was so sweet to spend time calling various places to try and get us a reservation.

Having come from a Tower room in the Luxor the night before (which was disgusting), I can tell you that it truly was an oasis to find ourselves in the Platinum -- we found ourselves actually wanting to spend time in the room. As we were on a girl's weekend, we took full advantage of the spa -- I especially recommend a facial and pedicure there. The breakfast and lunch restaurant was on the same floor as our room (the 5th), so were pretty much able to roll out of bed and go to breakfast. The restaurant overlooked the indoorr/outdoor pool and extensive patio area. We never got to the dinner restaurant/bar downstairs, but it looked nice. The room service is to-die-for! I believe it's even cheaper than the restaurant, which is very unusual in Vegas! We had asked for a cheese plate when we first arrived and they brought us this huge, stunning butcher block overflowing with various cheeses and fruits, accompanied by a large tray of assorted crackers (ie, no skimping at all there!). The only negative was that when we got back to our room on a Saturday night around midnight, there was some sort of private party happening somewhere within the upper floors of the hotel (we were asked to show our hotel keys to two very well-dressed bouncers before we could enter the elevator, which was roped off, with plenty of hip youngsters lining the walls of the lobby waiting (or hoping, should I say?) to be let upstairs.

Its not super scary, but there is road construction, some sort of construction site, a lot of traffic, and many questionable people that you cross paths with. (Like all of Vegas) I do not intimidate or worry about things like that, so other than the heat, it was fine for me. The hotel was pretty clean, but could be slightly better, there's just a couple of small things I would improve upon, but I admit, I am picky. It's nice having a refrigerator and washer/dryer, but certainly not a necessity unless staying a long time. But nice to have, especially considering the amount of water you need to drink when it's over 100. Overall, it's a pretty good value and if you are looking for off strip and specifically non-smoking, non-casino hotel , it's a pretty good choice.", "Date": "January 4, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Houston, Texas USA", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel - Great Location - Well Appointed\u201d", "Author": "TheDizons", "ReviewID": "UR52339514", "Content": "We stayed here for a week between Christmas and New Year's Day in a Princess Suite facing The Strip. For the most part we loved it. The following are the pros and cons: PROS --- The size of the room was awesome. My husband and I travelled with our 9 y/o son and 11 y/o daughter and there was plenty of room for all of us. The full kitchen was a great amenity. We were able to bring back leftovers and heat them up in the microwave or oven. The room had Cascade for the dishwasher, a sponge, and they brought us some dishwashing liquid. There were also dishes, utensils, glasses, and 2 cookie sheets. --- The washer and dryer were also great. There was Tide in the room and powder clothes softener (not sure of the name because we went out and bought Bounce). It was great being able to wash and dry as needed. --- The view of The Strip was great and although we didn't use the balcony much (because it was very cold), it was a great sized balcony. We were able to get a fantastic view of the New Year's Eve fireworks. The extra charge for The Strip view is well worth it. --- Housekeeping was good. Everytime we needed anything it was brought to our room in a very timely manner --- We never had to wait a long time for our vehicle. We would call the valet before we left our room and for the most part our vehicle was there when we got to the lobby. --- There was never a long wait for the elevator. CONS --- My biggest complaint would be the wireless internet service charge. We paid $12.99 per night. The disappointment came in the fact that my children were not able to use the internet on their brand new netbooks. They were really bummed out about this. I could not justify paying $12.99 per laptop. I've stayed in a Holiday Inn Express once (very small town) that had free wireless internet. If I was charged $12.99 per night I would have liked my children to be able to access the internet for their netbooks. --- Just a minor complaint because we don't access much help from the front desk during our stays (we also brought our GPS which was very helpful and eliminated the need for help for directions). The evening we checked in, the front desk agent greeted us with, \"Name\". She didn't even say \"Good Evening\" or \"Happy Holidays\" (we arrived on Christmas evening). She seemed bothered to be working on Christmas day. ---- Just one pot and one pan would have been very helpful. --- Not necessarily a con because I love free valet. If you are bringing a car, be sure and plan for the tips that you will give the valet drivers each time they bring your car around. We didn't go in and out much so it was very reasonable for us. We are definitely staying at this hotel again. It was a great place to stay. I hope that next time we stay here there is a better wireless internet arrangement. My children also love to browse the internet from their iPod Touch.", "Date": "January 2, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Scotland", "Title": "\u201cGet Your act together!!\u201d", "Author": "ManzilScotland", "ReviewID": "UR52212561", "Content": "Stayed at the Platinum 5 nights from 16th Dec 2009 to the 21st Dec.

The first night was my bridal shower which we had in the suite. When checking in, I told the front desk what the reason was for the stay and they upgraded us to a larger suite and were so helpful in telling all of my guests which room to go to and helping them with large gifts. They brought us things my sister (the hostess) forgot. They were fantastic! Having the full kitchen in the room was so helpful. The second night was the night before my wedding and they were great about having a cab waiting for us downstairs large enough to accomodate our group of five. My husband and I stayed there together the third night, our wedding night. The fireplace was so romantic. It was overall a beautiful, calm place to stay and the people working there just made it so much better. The only things about this hotel that may be negative would be about the valet parking and the bathtub. The forced valet parking was fine, I was just surprised by it. I never felt pressured to give a big tip but I just like to park my own car and lock it. I prefer to self park over valet. The jetted bathtub was so big and inviting looking. I took a long bath one morning and but when I finally turned on the jets, there was some stuff that came out with the water. Like a dark filmy substance. Now, I am sure that it was from whoever took a bath before me and they were using some weird bath salts or something and the bath was clean when I got in it. I guess that they just didn't clean out the jets properly which I would imagine they don't do every time anyway. I mean, I don't expect them to fill the tub up with water and run the jets every time they clean the tub just to make sure someone didn't use something gross in there and then repeat that for every room, every day.

All we can say is that it was like a home away from home.... From check in with Brianna we were at all times treated so well by everyone, especially Nathan the Manager on duty. We were celebrating my 40th birthday and were treated to complimentary champagne and chocolate covered strawberries on more than one occasion during our 5 night stay. In particular, Nathan, Trinity, Brianna at the front desk and Joel and Marco, Bell Men and Christian in the Bar were outstanding. Matt and Alex at the front desk were also pleasant. Nathan and Trinity were great at suggesting trips and looking up tours to the Grand Canyon and tickets for shows, much appreciated to get the local heads up... During our trip to Vegas we travelled to San Francisco for 3 days and were delighted to be welcomed back to the hotel. Our room 1516 was spacious, with a good view, ok its the back of the buildings on the strip that you see. We had breakfast coupons for the first 3 days, but these were inadvertently charged to our room, which Nathan sorted out when mentioned to him. The only slight issue was on our second day we had to phone 3 different times 12 noon, 6.30pm and again at 04.00am for the guest bed to be made up, in the end the linen arrived quite quickly and we made the spare bed up ourselves at 4am. The late arrival was after enjoying the $6.99 steak and beer special next door in Ellis Island, definitely an experience worth trying... good food, home brew, great value Next door to the hotel there is a half price tickets booth for all the shows and we were lucky enough to be able to enjoy 3 superb shows... We were on foot and had no problem with the short trek to the strip, so we cannot comment on the valet parking except to say that the Bell Men were great at getting cabs when needed for the airport etc and even ran after our taxi man after he tried to pull a fast one and drive off with some of out christmas shopping left in his trunk..... Just a tip re cabs, get the number of the driver if you have any issues, we heard scary stories of people being overcharged for regular cab fares The hotel is an oasis of calm within the madness and insanity that is all about Las Vegas.

Also, having a full kitchen at our disposal saved a ton of money and it was refreshing not to be forced to eat out for every meal. The rooms were very clean and spacious. It was handy having an MP3 dock also. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. We didn't get a chance to visit any of the restaurants or pool, but we did take a look at them and hopefully next time we'll be able to fit them in.

Definitely check the VRBO site for deals that the various owners may be having. Our room was basically a one bedroom apartment with the bedroom having 2 queen size beds; the living room area had a large sleeper sofa. The room was clean and modern with all the standard amenities. The bathroom was probably the largest I've ever seen for a hotel/condo; the tub could easily fit 4 people. Towels and toiletries are provided but not replenished unless you request them at no charge. There is a charge, however, if you want your room cleaned daily. We paid a cleaning fee upon checking out. The hotel itself was also new and modern with all the bells and whistles. STIR Lounge is located on the first floor adjacent to the lobby. There's also a spa located on the 4th floor and the very large outdoor pool area with hot tub is located on the 5th floor overlooking the Strip.

My family and I had the best time there this past weekend (9/17 - 9/20) and we'll definitely be staying there again! Not only were the rooms huge & comfortable, it was wonderful being away from the chaos and craziness of the Strip. We read so many negative & positive reviews here that we didn't know what to expect but, it was everything we could have hoped for and more! The non-smoking, non-gaming environment was perfect for my sister who is highly allergic. We didn't spend a lot of time inside the casino's but, it was still nice to return to a clean place to relax and sleep! The Valet staff were a DREAM! They helped us take apart the motorized scooter that we rented for my mom & get it in & out of our rental car. By the end of our stay, they knew us all by name. They even gave us tips on places to eat & party and provided great directions to the outlet malls, etc. There was a bit of confusion @ check-in but, it was quickly resolved. At one point, we realized our suite door wasn't locking but, after a call to the front desk, a technician quickly arrived to repair it. Initially, he thought he would be able to reset the lock but, after realizing he couldn't, he simply installed a new one. The whole problem was solved in no more than 15 minutes. The food at the 5th floor restaurant was great with such large portions that I brought 1/2 of my pancakes home. They were even better the 2nd day! The staff were helpful and had great meal suggestions. The view of the pool and Strip from the floor-to-ceiling windows was fabulous! One final positive thing, I originally reserved a Marquis Suite for (6) girls but, when (2) dropped out, we downsized to a Princess Suite with strip view. Even though the Princess was beautiful & spacious, we were still curious about the Marquis so, I asked the Front Desk about taking a peek at one. They graciously made us a temporary key so that we could check things out and man, did we get a treat! That room is incredibly HUGE! Our only disappointment was that we weren't staying there! lol.... Be aware, there is quite a bit of construction going on but, it's nothing to cry about! Just plan to leave a little earlier on your outings or just park the car and walk.

Our stay couldn't have been much better. We had come to Vegas to party and play poker and the hotel was perfect for the times when we wanted to relax. The rooms are basically apartments. We stayed in a standard twin room - 2x comfy queen beds, large bathroom with shower and jacuzzi/hot tub and 2 sinks, FULLY fitted kitchen with American fridge freezer (it even has crushed ice for your home made mojitos), utensils etc., 2 TVs, double sofa-bed, Bose cd/radio... plus more! The view from our balcony caught the stunning sunrise over the mountains. Strip views are available too I believe. There are 24/7 shops nearby if you want some food to cook or beer to keep in the fridge. The only annoyances with the room was the balcony floor was dirty and blackened my feet though that was cleaned after a phone call to reception. The other is fairly minor - the coffee and tea on offer in the room was terrible. Tea in Vegas full stop is terrible. The bar is pleasant. Good selection of spirits, beer and wine plus there's happy hour 5-7pm daily. Bar food is OK for the happy hour price but wouldn't want to pay full price. Bartenders were great - knowledgable about the city and very friendly. There is a spa but neither of us got a chance to go plus it was closed Mon-Wed though that might be an off-season thing. Winter months and Easter are the busiest times in Vegas we were told. the first weekend of Septmber was \"labor day weekend\" where people flood to the city to party - be aware prices on restaurants and clubs tend to go up. The Bellagio breakfast buffet was double the price at $30. The gym at the Platinum is well equipped and FREE. A word not often associated with Vegas. A manager of the hotel sorted us out with a great deal for Pure nightclub at Caesar's Palace, which happens every Tuesday and is rammed. We got a booth and a buy one get one free offer on bottle serves. One of the funnest and drunkest nights I've had (and I'm a bartender!). The hotel is no smoking and casino free, which means it has 2 massive appeals over places like the superhotels Caesar's, MGM, Mirage, Bellagio etc. No stinking of smoke and no 10 minute walk past the slot machines when you forget your camera from your room. The big casino hotels, though pretty awesome, are mazes and can be a pain to walk around in. The pool at the Platinum is a bit lame but there's nothing stopping you from going to another hotel's pool. I didn't come to Vegas to swim seeing as it's in the desert. $20 is ample for a taxi from the airport and the monorail station at Bally's is just a few minutes walk away.

CONS PUBLIC Areas: Grubby carpets inside the elevators & in the elevator \"lobby\" on several floors - the carpets needed cleaning and the hallways really needed vacuuming; almost all the chaise cushions at the pool have ugly stains; the driveway entrance can only be approached Eastbound on Flamingo due to construction as concrete bollards block the center line of East Flamingo; Driveway is not as nice an approach as The Sig which is set back from Harmon & is more private & quiet: The Platinum driveway right off Flamingo & is cramped, with space for only 2 or 3 cars at a time. It is often very tight jockeying the valet cars & taxis in this small area. THE ROOM: Many, many issues and it became very tiring to constantly call to have problems addressed. The air conditioning did not work (yes we had the room key in the slot). It stopped working twice in the middle of the night when that day had reached 108! We asked to be moved to another room which only occurred after visits from the repairman, then 2 calls to request a different room. Housekeeping definitely needs to be improved as there were hairs many places: on the sink, in the tub, in jacuzzi jets, between the dish plates in the cupboard! Really! The carpets were not vacuumed nor were the floors mopped during our entire 5 day stay. Always something was omitted each day: fresh towels, shampoo, conditioner, dish washer soap,paper towels, laundry soap, dryer sheets (yes there is a washer/dryer in the unit - which The Sig does not have). One day housekeeping did not clean our room at all. Batteries were dead in the TV remote. Everyday it was something- we just got tired of doing their quality control for them, especially when the front desk often did not answer the phone. Then there is the design of the room: only 3 lamps with dim CFC bulbs in the bedroom and living room. Very difficult to read/see in the evening. There are no ceiling lights in either of these rooms. Lighting in bathroom is also poor. Also if one has a shy bladder the \"privy\" is not private, its not in its own room, like The Sig. So...when at The Sig, one has privacy when using the toilet & someone could be using the sink/tub. OKAY the PLUSES; The Platinum does have washer/dryer combo. The hotel is closer to the center of the Strip and is about half a mile to the Bellagio & Caesar's. Price - we paid around $135 was a good value versus $219 (then add their $20/nt + tax \"resort\" fee) at The Sig. We found the valet to be very quick as we called from our room to request our car. We never waited more than 1 minute for our car to arrive once we descended to the lobby. The valet staff were excellent. The happy hour is very good value: 1/2 off well drinks, 1/2 off appetizers ($3.50 for a good size of chicken tenders w/fries, or 8\" pizza). The barista does generous pours and we would return the Stir bar even if staying elsewhere. The bar is sophisticated and intimate with comfy chairs & tables, even a nook with more privacy. It is definitely better value that The Sig. The Sig's bar seems more like an after thought, set off a central hallway & their small drinks are expensive. The Platinum's Fitness Center on the 4th floor is very good (not as nice/equipped as The Sig) and we usually had it all to ourselves. Twelve machines (ellipses, treadmills, Gauntlet, bikes, Stairmasters), plus weight machines and a small selection of free weights. The bottom line is we saved about $300 by staying at The Platinum. But if The Sig had been offering a Stay 3 nights, Get 1 Free promotion - we'd have gone with the The Sig. Even with all the room & housekeeping issues, we just kept reminding ourselves of the $300 savings.

My family consisted of myself, my spouse and my 3 children. We had stayed at the Platinum a few times, but recently in April 2009 which was a nice stay, but we did have a small issue with the communication and understanding of the incidental deposit charge. (Make sure you have $100/night set aside on your credit card for the deposit-most hotels/resorts with nice rooms do charge about this amount). I spoke to one of the managers about the issue, and after a detailed survey, was graciously re-invited back to the Platinum with a comp night stay. Also, depending on availability, it's possible to get a comp upgrade. It appeared to me that the management here does stand behind the value of customer satisfaction. The hotel has valet parking in which the attendants provide nice personable service, & if you stay long enough they really know you by name, which is always nice. Just make sure to have a dollar or so for a tip here-and-there (unless you hit the big bucks!). On several occasions, the clerks at the Front Desk have accommodated ALL of my requests. Our 1st night, we stayed in a Solitaire Ste & had addtl reservations to change to the Princess Ste. At check in, Juan had pre-arranged a smooth transition to change rooms ahead of time. We turned in the keys from the Solitaire room & Eva gave us the new keys for the Princess Ste with prompt bellhop service without having to leave the hotel for hours and return at the next check-in time. Awesome service! We haven't had the experience at the lounge or the restaurant yet, but definitely made good use of the full kitchen with everything, except antibacterial liquid. We even used the washer and dryer this time (in the Princess Ste). Loved the fact that dad & the kids had their own areas to sleep in (sep by a door) and their own t.v. The pool was excellent! The temperature was great, and my kids loved going back and forth from the outdoor side, to the indoor side. We even stayed to the new extended hours, 11pm. Using the huge jacuzzi tub (fits 2 adults) in the large dbl-sink bathroom the next day was a treat. Room service even brought us extra towels and bedding at almost 8pm at night. We all loved the views from the balcony. Even though it was hot in July, it was still so nice to just stand out there and see the lights and feel the atmosphere from out on the balcony, especially from the 9th to the 17th floor. On our way out, I was able to meet with the manager and thanked her for a GREAT stay, and she even did a restaurant search for us and provided us with a print out of directions. Much thanks to Claire and her team at the Platinum. They really did it for us this year. They enhanced our stay which was uplifting during these hard times in 2009.

While we were very impressed with the reviews we had seen and the descriptions on their website, this hotel fell far short of all our expectations. We booked the together forever package which was to include our suite, a couples massage, chocolate covered strawberries and wine, and breakfast in the morning. Upon arriving to the hotel to check in after requesting a king sized bed we were told by the woman at the front desk that rooms type are not a guaranteed and are just a request. If we wanted we could upgrade to a higher floor for additional money and she could get us a king sized bed, otherwise we would have to take the two queens. We went ahead and paid the additional $20 for the upgraded room on the higher floor which ended up having a view of the power plant across the street. After requesting at check-in that the strawberries and wine be sent up to the room, and being told they would arrive shortly, they finally arrived a mere one hour later. We then attempted to book our couples massage in the spa for that evening only to find out that 1) they cannot accommodate two massages at the same time (no staff), we had to book one after the other and 2) the spa was already closed for the night (6pm) and we would have to wait until the next day if we wanted to get our massages. We decided to try and salvage our already losing battle to celebrate our anniversary by heading over to the strip and have a romantic dinner and take in a few sights. We had an exceptional dinner at Three Olives inside Bellagio (A+++) and greatly enjoyed the fountains and our trip up the Eiffel Tower. This was without a doubt the best part of our stay, being outside of the hotel! However, upon returning to the hotel we were amazed by the number of kids in the lobby and inquired as to who else was in the hotel. We were told a bunch of sports teams were in for the weekend. Throughout the night we continually heard kids up and down the hallway bouncing balls, making lots of noise and making it absolutely unbearable to sleep. We called the front desk several times to report the noise and were told that they would send someone up, however it never ended and it was a horrible night. The next morning tired and hungry we headed to the restaurant to have breakfast. The service in the restaurant is an absolute joke. We ordered and saw our server once to drop off the juice, after that we waited for almost 30 minutes before I finally got up to ask were our food was. The restaurant wasn't even that busy maybe 10 to 15 others in there as well. I was told it would be right out, however, it still took another 10 minutes before we were served. The food was only luke warm and I was just ready to go home. My wife suggested that we just pack up and head home as who only knew what would happen if we went for our massages and since we couldn't have our \"couples massage\" together it really wasn't worth all the hassle. We went to the front desk to check out and had been told by the woman at check-in to charge everything to the room and all would be taken care of. But to our surprise when we looked over the bill our credit card and already been charged for the strawberries, wine and breakfast. The woman at the desk quickly removed the charges from our card and told us the systems had posted them in error. We just received our credit card statement in the mail and the charge which was supposedly removed for the services has now reappeared on our card. I called the hotel several times last week and tried to speak with someone in accounting as the front desk manager said she could not remove the charges from our card and I still have yet to hear back after leaving three messages for some woman that never seems to be available. In all for the amount of money we spent to have an enjoyable anniversary in a nice off strip hotel we are now wishing we had just booked at a lower rate at one of the mega resorts and called it even. We would absolutely not recommend this hotel to anyone as the service level is well below where it should be for the price paid and all the extra hassles are just not worth it. I don\u2019t know who\u2019s in charge of this place but it would do them good to take in a good dose of their own customer service and learn from it.

This is definetely that! I don't like cigarette smoke, so my number 1 priority when booking a room, is that it is non-smoking. The Platinum hotel is an all-suite, non-smoking hotel (I LOVE that). No walking around the hotel smelling like an ashtray. The hotel is about a block from the strip, not sure how long it would take you to get to the strip on foot (it's July & waaaaay to hot to be walking in the daytime). We caught a taxi everywhere we went (mainly because we were all drinking) & the average price for the 4 of us was $8. All of the places we went to were on the strip. We didn't eat at the restaurant, per say. We ordered food from the restaurant and ate it in the lounge. It was pretty good. I'm not sure of the restaurant hours, but there isn't room service after a certain hour, so if you're coming back from partying somewhere, you may want to pick up something to eat or eat out. There aren't any restaurants within walking distance (well, there is one at the Ellis Island Hotel, but I wouldn't recommend it. We didn't feel safe in there at all). There is a 7-11 & AM/PM close by. We had a great time at the Stir Lounge! Dante & Raul are very sweet & they make sure you are always taken care of. It's not a big lounge, but thats ok. I'm all about low-key & relaxing. If you're looking for the night club experience, you won't find it here. We didnt' use the pool, but it does look very nice. It wasn't ever too crowded (our balcony overlooked the pool). Very nice gentleman named Julian helped us with our luggage & showed us to our room. We stayed in the Marquise Suite. It is a humongous room, plenty of space for the 4 of us. It has 2 master suites with very large bathrooms. The spa tub is amazing! The kitchen is huge in this room, it's bigger than the kitchen in my house. We had an ice maker, so we didn't need to go run for ice. We also had a washer & dryer, which came in handy after hanging out in the Palms Casino (smokey). Dining room & living room are also very large, which made a great place for us to hang out. My only two minor complaints about this hotel would be that housekeeping didn't clean the room very well. We found some Cheetos left in the couch by the previous room occupants. Also, the surrounding neighborhood isn't quite as pretty as the strip, but really that's ok. I like the comforts that the hotel has to offer, and I'm sure by the time I go back, all the empty lots surrounding the hotel will be filled with some other hotel. We really loved this place & can't wait for our next stay! Thank you Julian, Dante & Raul!

Breakfast and lunch were delicious and very reasonably priced with great service. The pool wasn't crowded at all. It was nice to hang out there because we aren't gamblers. We didn't use the spa or 1st floor restaurant. Unfortunately, we had almost constant high WINDs the entire 3 days we were there. We enjoy walking on nice warm days, but found the walk to be a chore in the wind. Also, the construction on Flamingo made it a bit hard to get a cab, for they had to go right out of the hotel and drive down quite a ways to turn around towards the strip. Also, it irks me that there's a charge for internet at these Vegas hotels. Vegas finds a way to get into your wallet at every turn!

The pool area was small but not crowded even on a sold out day and in the middle of a heat wave (all 3 days were a sweltering 100+F). The kids really enjoyed the pool using it to cool down and tan themselves. We had breakfast once at Kilowat (which also services the pool area) and used a coupon from restaurant.com so it was good value for our money.

We had three rooms to accommodate us all - one of the rooms was extremely large with two huge bedrooms and bathrooms, flatscreen TV plus a balcony and a dining area. We used this room as a 'meeting place' for our group and prepared cocktails and appetizers each night before going out. The room I stayed in was a very large one bedroom with another huge bathroom and smaller balcony. All the rooms had big, full size kitchens with large, American-style refrigerators. The rooms are very tastefully decorated in muted tones like olive green, beige, brown and black. The beds were comfortable and the rooms were large enough to add a couple of extra cot beds to accommodate our group. We arranged for groceries to be delivered to the largest suite and the staff took care of putting everything away. The main drawback to this hotel, in my opinion, is the pool area. It is basically a no frills pool deck area that sits on top of the car park, and is rather disappointing considering how nice the rooms are at the hotel. It is painted in orange and has some seating areas with yellow umbrellas. The sun loungers are padded and they provide towels. There are no plants or other decor. The pool area, at least during our trip in April, stays shaded in the morning until about 11:30am because of the side of the hotel it is situated on. I am making these points about the pool because I have stayed in other hotels in Vegas including Mandalay Bay, the Venetian, and the Rio. All have large pool areas with multiple pools, jacuzzis, bars, etc. If you are looking for a pool scene, then the Platinum is not the hotel for you. Because we were a group of girlfriends catching up, this was ok for us and actually it was very easy for all 20 of us to sit together. At the larger hotels during peak holiday periods, finding empty chairs can be a challenge. The location of the hotel actually was not that bad. Yes, it is off the strip but you can walk about 10 minutes and reach Caesar's Palace. We did not have a problem getting a taxi.

The suite at the Platinum was really lovely. Appreciated the full kitchen and all the space. They upgraded us to a better suite than we reserved (fireplace and 2 person whirlpool). I'm not sure why -- perhaps because we wanted a low floor (DH doesn't like heights), and that was what they had available. Anyway, would have been wonderful even without those extras. All the staff at the hotel were extremely friendly. Good fitness room. The pool is fairly ordinary looking (but adequate), but we didn't use it anyway. Nice large tv, but not too many channels (but good enough for us). There is a lovely spa (but never got around to using it -- pricey!) Really happy there (actually I wanted to spend more time in the room than we did!). There is an Enterprise Rent a Car in the Westin right across the street, if you need a car for a day (we did, to go to the Hoover Dam). There is a 7-eleven almost next door. For real groceries we went East a couple of miles on Flamingo to Maryland pkway (there is an Albertson there). We had a car for that. Suppose you could take a bus or cab (or walk, if you are really, really, energetic and not carrying too much). Originally we had wanted to stay at the Signature, but it didn't work out (too expensive). Signature is more upscale I think, but I actually prefer the Platiinum now that I've been there. In terms of location, the Platinum is much better in my opinion. The Signature is farther south on the strip and that stretch of the strip doesn't seem as nice (lots more people there trying to force girly pictures into your hands). Also, it would be a much longer walk up towards the Mirage or the Venetion from the Signature, if you just want to wander around. Depends on where you want to be, I guess :) Anyway, I highlyrecommend the Platinum.

What attracted us to the Platinum was the size of the apartments, the newness, the location- a couple blocks away from the strip, good ta reviews and the price. Check in- great, we arrived around 2 and were given an upgrade for free, we got a view suite with a washer and dryer, I wish I packed less! Room- very nice sized 1 bedroom, simple, modern decor, big kitchen with nice black granite, full fridge, lots of cabinets, dishes included. Living area- nice size with sofa, chair, desk with chair and flat screen. Patio- nice size- our view was the back of Bally's, Paris, Flamingo, you could see parts of Ceasars and a slim shot of the fountains going off from Bellagio. Bedroom- 2 queen beds- comfy, nice pillows, nice closet. Bathroom, big tub- kinda cheap plastic sides tho, nice tiled shower- good water pressure, 2 sinks, a closet. Washer and Dryer was off to the kitchen and that worked great, did laundry twice, housekeeping provides laundry soap. I thought it was a clean room but my husband found some garbage under the sofa bed and a dirty rag in the bathroom that was missed, but overall nice new room with lots of storage. Groceries- we bought stuff- juice, water, chips from the 7/11 nearby, there's also an am/pm but not much variety. Pool- wow, 3 of the 4 nights we had the pool to ourselves! My kids loved the indoor pool, warm and they'd go thru the outdoor pool to the hot tub and loved it. It was their favorite part of their vacation. There are lots of chairs and towels. Service- everyone was pretty nice and helpful. To get a cab from here is easy, you just go down to the front and they get one for you, take 5-10 minutes. I tried to print my boarding passes and they do not have free internet, surprisingly. Their business center to use the computer had so many instructions and it was like .69 a minute to use and it looked so confusing. This service should be free. This was my only complaint. After 2 days, we got burnt out on the walk to the strip. It's about 12-15 minute walk with kids and we walked the strip most of the day so the kids got tired of walking. The buses were often full and the monorail is not that convenient, behind the hotels and pricey. Platinum was nice and reasonable but if we were to go to Vegas again, I'd choose something right on the strip, just easier. If I went with kids, I'd stay at Mandalay bay for the beach and pool but then again, I'd probably just save my money for a real beach vacation in Kauai. Highly recommend Ellis Island which is 2 doors across from the Platinum- we ate there 3 times, twice for breakfast which was great, reasonable, and dinner was awesome- the BEST ribs ever! My DH had a plate of ribs, corn, beans, slaw for $11- huge plate, tender, meaty ribs. I had the 1/2 rack ribs and 1/2 chicken for $9, again awesome, delicious bbq cooked right in front of you in their patio, don't miss it!", "Date": "March 11, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Canada", "Title": "\u201cGreat rooms, something a bit different, non smoking\u201d", "Author": "JelmeisterCanada", "ReviewID": "UR25462702", "Content": "I usually stay on one of the strip hotels, and certainly there are cheaper places than the Platinum to stay, especially with all the deals at the moment.

We appreciated the opportunity to bring our restaurant leftovers to this location as well! My biggest complaint was their Valet Parking. When visiting, we ended up parking next door at the Tuscany Casino just so we would not be required to pay out any extraneous tips. To me, this is a Ripoff. Required valet parking in Las Vegas is unusual -- so, that's an unfortunate thing with the Platinum. I have one more complaint: we arrived at 3:30PM and they did not have a room ready for those who were staying in the room. I'm not entirely sure of their check-in time but the guests were waylaid for a half hour until an upgraded room could be assigned. Generally, the group who stayed in the room really loved the service staff. The hotel is about 5 blocks from the Strip but not a bad walking distance.

I have read hundreds of reviews about The Platinum and it is often referred to in the same breath as The Signature, or The Hotel at Mandalay Bay. I have stayed at The Signature and Mandalay Bay many times so I was curious to try The Platinum because it was cheaper that the other two hotels on the weekend I was traveling to Vegas. The Platinum is nice, but it is not close to the caliber of The Signature, Mandalay Bay, or even Red Rock for that matter. I was traveling with my spouse and 3 children under 8. Upon arrival I was less than impressed with the initial first impression that the hotel gives. There is a gas station in the parking lot, and a boarded up building next door. The entrance into the hotel is very small and you have to flip a U-turn to get into the Valet parking. There is no self parking, but that is ok with me as I prefer to Valet. There was no bell hop present and the Valet Staff was less than eager to help me with my bags. They eventually brought a luggage rack to assist with my baggage as my wife was unable to help because she was 7 months pregnant. The lobby is nice but very small. There is no snack shop or store of any kind in the hotel. The lobby has a small club that is open in the evenings, but nothing distinct. Our room was on the 6th floor and we were as far as you could get from the elevators. With small children this proved to be a chore. The room was very nice. The kitchen is nice with very nice countertops and stainless steel appliances. The separate bedroom was essential for us with three children in tow. The accomodations were very comfortable. The TV in the living area seemed small, I think only 32 inches, but it is a plasma which is nice. The TV in the bedroom is not a flat screen and was probably a 27 incher. Our room did not have a view at all as we looked directly into a wall. You get what you pay for I guess. On Saturday evening we wanted to retreive our vehicle around 6pm to go to dinner with family members that live in the area. I called valet prior to leaving my room and they did not answer. When I got to the lobby , there was no wait at the valet desk and they quickly took my ticket. For several minutes I was the only one waiting for my car. There is no waiting area designated for valet so I was practically standing in the parking lot with my wife and 3 small children. I waited about 15 minutes for my vehicle and there were no other guests waiting for cars. This is not a big deal, but waiting in a parking lot with little kids made me very irritated. Upon checkout on Sunday morning the staff was very friendly. I called the bell staff and they were to my room within 5 minutes. He asked if I had a car in valet and promised to have it waiting by the time I got to the lobby. When we got downstairs all of our luggage was loaded and the car was ready for us to drive off. This service was the highlight of my stay. The pool is very nice for winter months because half of the pool is covered. It is a little deep for small children but fulfills its purpose. Overall I felt that the hotel was nice, but not luxurious like so many reviews have said. We paid $139 and about $152 with taxes and fees. The room itself was worth the money, but the ambiance, location, and lack of ammenities would keep me from staying here again. I would not recommend this hotel if you don't have a car. If you have the chance to stay at The Signature, jor any 4 or 5 star hotel on the strip, ump at the chance. You will not regret it. I think I even prefer the Grand View at South point to this hotel.

It's within walking distance of the Strip (you can cut through Bally's), but I'd still recommend getting a car, because it can be quite a hike after a night of drinking and gambling. We didn't eat at the hotel or use the pool or spa, so I can't comment on that.

Apparently it began its life as an apartment building and the room that we had was essentially a 1 bedroom apartment. We arrived early in Las Vegas and when we got to the hotel, we expected that we would have to leave our bags and return later in the day to complete check in. Thankfully they had a room ready for us and we were blown away when we opened the door. The first thing that greeted us was the large open plan kitchen/dining and lounge room. Then we saw the large bedroom and gigantic bathroom where you could have had a small party. Everything about the place is fantastic and recently renovated. The room also had a small private balcony. It would have been wonderful to enjoy the amenities in the kitchen, as well as a soak in the large bathroom, but unfortunately we were only in Las Vegas for less than 24 hours. I understand the hotel also has a pool and beauty facilities, but our brief stay meant we didn't get the opportunity to enjoy either of these. The price that we paid for the room was very reasonable and I am really glad that we made the decision to pay for the room earlier this year when the Australian Dollar was stronger. Regardless of that, the room price represents exceptional value for money. The hotel is an easy walk away from the strip and if you get loaded up with lots of shopping, it isn\u2019t too far to come back to the hotel to dump your bags. You should be aware that, unlike most of the other hotels in Las Vegas, this one doesn't have a casino or themed shopping arcades on site. But when all of that is so easily accessible elsewhere, you don't really need it right outside your door.

We booked a Solitaire suite and it was SO nice. There was a full kitchen with refrig, stove, dw, microwave and stone countertops. It was stocked with dishes & utensils if you like to cook your own meals (we didn't). There is a living room with flat-panel TV & Bose radio, a bedroom with a 2nd TV plus a pillow-top king-size bed and the bathroom is unbelievable. There are 2 sinks, marble countertop, tile shower and jacuzzi bath. Everything is very clean and well kept - just like the entire hotel. The entire building is non-smoking so there is no cigarette smell that you get just about everywhere in Vegas. They charge a large fee to anyone caught smoking in their room. We did see & smell evidence of smoking - butts on the floor in the stairwells, but nowhere else. Check in is at 4pm so plan accordingly. We got there around 1 on Sat and our room wasn't ready until 4. We left our bags with the concierge and checked out the nearby places. There is an Arco gas station right next door with music playing, so I don't think you'd want a room on the lower floors next to that (ours was on the \"mountain\" side rather than the \"strip\" side). Ellis Island is about a 2 minute walk around the corner and is a great place for cheap good meals. Be sure to get the $4.99 5-oz NY steak & eggs breakfast or the $6.99 10-oz sirloin steak dinner. Bally's is a 5-minute walk from the hotel, very safe but lots of traffic on the street. One thing we learned is to go through Bally's parking lot where it is much quieter rather than walking on the sidewalk. Once at Bally's its another 5 minutes to the Monorail station, where we each bought a 3-day (72 hours) pass for $28. This will take you anywhere on the strip between the MGM Grand up to the Hilton. As advised here, we asked for a room on the upper floors and got a room on the 5th floor - very quiet yet convenient to the fitness center & Kilawat restaurant. The fitness center was very nice with several machines & free weights, and 4 TVs to watch. Bring your own headphones though as the ones provided were all in the \"used\" bowl.

It's nonsmoking with no casino, both pluses for me. The two-room suites are huge, with a full kitchen, washer and dryer, and two-person whirlpool with separate tile shower. It was really more than I needed, but anyone, especially a couple, coming for an extended stay would really hit the jackpot (ha!). The rate was outstanding - $160 per night. The hotel was quiet. There is some road noise from a busy nearby intersection, and some airplane noise, but keeping the A/C fan on takes care of that. There is a 7-11 next door for food and snacks, including frozen entrees if you actually decided to cook in the room. It is a short walk to the monorail and Strip (10 minutes). The neighborhood is tacky but OK. I had a business meeting at the Flamingo, and walked the two blocks several times. People staying at the Flamingo complained about mold and noise, and I just smiled. If you want to gamble, the Westin is a half block away, with a nonsmoking casino. Ellis Island casino and restaurant is next door, a throwback to early Vegas- dark, smoky, and funky - but with decent and cheap food available (a $6.99 steak dinner).

The front desk was a continuation of great service and check-in was a breeze. They upgraded us at check in to a larger suite which was nice. However, all rooms at the platinum are suites, the smallest being 900+ square feet so you wont ever be staying in a bad room. The room was very clean and tidy and smelled nice. It included everything including a washer/dryer with included soap and dryer sheets as well as a fireplace. The room was absolutely gigantic with GREAT views of the strip. The hotel is non-smoking which is an extra plus if you dont smoke. (Those of you who dont like tobacco smoke know how impossible it is to get away from it in vegas.) Each time we entered in the hotel, the front desk asked how we were and how the room was. They were very kind and courteous. The location of the hotel is about a block and a half off the strip. However, we were located only about a 5 minute walk to the monorail station at Ballys and that was perfect. The location isnt that bad and my wife and I enjoyed the 5 minute stroll each night back to the hotel on a safe Flamingo Rd. You can also take the Deuce bus that runs flamingo rd if you dont want to walk. There are no dangerous concerns that you need to worry about. The only bad thing we encountered was an interesting smell as we got off of the elevator on the floor of our room. It was only by the cleaning closet and it wasnt in our room but it wasnt pleasant.

I arrived at 11:30 to check in and the girl at the front desk informed me that my room was not ready yet (I figured that might happen, no big deal). She told me I could upgrade to a better room for either $45 or $60 per night. I declined and asked when the room would be ready. She said 4pm. I was prepared to hang out and do something, I asked if there was a chance the room would be ready earlier, she at first said no. I inquired if maybe, possibly, I could check back one of the rooms might be ready, she seemed hesitant to admit that one of the rooms in the entire hotel could be ready then, but conceded it could be. She said she\u2019d check me in and I could just come back for the key, well during the check in process she tells me she is upgrading me for free, that\u2019s awfully nice I think. I get to my room, excited to freshen up and think to myself, this seems exactly like the room I expected (my sister confirmed it was a standard suite when she arrived later on). So I wonder if they tell you there are no rooms to coerce you into an upgrade, I thought about complaining, but figured I\u2019d let it go. Then I couldn\u2019t get the TV on or adjust the AC. I called down to the front desk and she informed me I had a \u201cgreen room\u201d where you need to insert the room key into a slot near the door to activate some of the lights, TV and AC. Gee, you think they would have told me that when I checked in. The next problem was with the AC, I could adjust it and it would work for about 5-10 minutes and then shut off. I stopped by the front desk, the girl who checked me in said \u201cI don\u2019t think you can adjust the air\u201d. I walked away thinking that didn\u2019t make any sense and when I returned from the pool later I called down again and they sent up a maintenance guy to look at it, sure enough he had to reset the system. He even changed the AC filter, he was very polite and quick about it. The suite was quite spacious with kitchen, living room, bedroom, although the toilet is not separate from the shower or sinks or tub, so you can only have one person in there at a time, which is a weird use of space for such a large suite. It was very clean, although we found if you were in the room in the morning when housekeeping came they either wouldn\u2019t come back or would call to ask if you wanted the room serviced. The location is a bit off the strip, which I knew. The walk to Bally\u2019s wasn\u2019t so much far to enter the side door by the Sport\u2019s book, it was a little sketchy though, not sure I\u2019d feel safe if I was a single woman. Right next to the hotel is an AM/PM market and an abandoned dry cleaner that has about 4 dudes who look like Tom Hanks from the movie Castaway living in front of it. There is also a 7-11. So there are all kinds of snacks, etc available nearby. This is good since in the hotel itself there is only one restaurant and room service available. There is a bar downstairs, but it was empty most of the time. There is no quick place available for coffee inside, you can make it yourself in your room or do like I did and walk to the AM/PM, which was fine with me since I got to see a guy who looked exactly like Eddie Murphy as Velvet Jones from SNL. The Pool area is nice, I don\u2019t really have any complaints about it, although there is no lifeguard or supervision there so if you get a rowdy group they will jump in and horse around, etc. Doesn\u2019t bother me, but it might some people.

The positives: - Just a few blocks off the Strip. An easy 5 to 10 minute walk. - Reasonable prices by Vegas terms. We paid about $180 per night, all-in.

Large kitchen with refrigerator and dishwasher. - Quiet (that's a biggie !) The negatives: - 100% valet parking - can be a hassle if you need to get something out of your car. Also, you can wait a long time if others are wanting their cars at the same time. - No automatic doors and no doorman. This was a problem as we had a lot of bags and nobody offered to even hold a door open. - The room was not exactly clean. There were some long black hairs in the sink when we arrived. Also, we used the pull-out sofa bed, and when we moved it away from the wall, there was a lot of dirt and other stuff hiding back there. The cleaning appeared to be superficial and not particularly thorough. - Expensive spa service (we thought about using it, but saw the prices and changed our minds) - No shuttle service, which would be a great selling point for this place if they had one - Not a great neighborhood (is there one 3 blocks from the Strip?)

The rooms are amazing, really huge and comfortable with all the amenities you could ask for: jacuzzi tubs, washer/dryer, full kitchen, all great stuff. All this for around $100, it's really hard to believe. The location is decent, you can walk to the Monorail and the Strip, but you're far enough back no tot have to deal with the traffic and headaches. I think the \"valet parking only\" idea is crap, frankly, I am more than capable of parking a car, even in \"one a dem parkin geerages.\" But hey, they have limited space and I don't think they charge for the service. Now, here's the big 'ol problem. It's bad enough that I would probably not recommend the place to anyone else. A group of us traveling on business booked six rooms. One of our group doesn't travel much, so his company credit card gets used only once or twice a year. Within a day of checking out of the Platinum, the only place where he used the card in the past nine months, fraudulent charges start popping up--online purchases delivered to PO Boxes. Another member of our group was mysteriously charged an extra $150. Another guest had his rate changed at checkout time without any explanation. Me, I had a $14 charge show up with no explanation either, after I checked out. Four out of six of us having to call either the hotel or the police due to activity related to the hotel seems to be more than a minor problem, it seems systemic and perhaps even sanctioned.

This hotel offers fantastic accomodation; an apartment rather than a room! We were fortunate to be allocated a 12th floor suite with a good view of the strip, particularly Caesar's Palace, from our balcony. Unlike other travellers, we did not experience significant road noise, although Flamingo Road is a busy highway, day and night, so being in a suite on a lower floor and directly adjacent to the road, which we weren't, i can imagine it would be noisy. We were impressed with the high standards of cleanliness and attention to detail within the suite although we did experience some difficulties with the jacuzzi bath, which emptied half its contents onto the bathroom floor due to the jets being at a very high pressure and angled up, rather than in towards the bath! On this occasion housekeeping were quick to respond with plenty of fresh towels to mop up. We also experienced difficulties with the remote control for the TV which led to us inadvertently ordering a movie twice, one charge of which was refunded at check out. As a general comment, it was frustrating to not have a manual for the equipment in the suite, and no kettle! We had to 'filter' hot water through the coffee percolator with no coffee to make hot water for a morning cup of tea. The pool area was very pleasant and a welcome haven after the desert heat although on consecutive days the water temperature went from being comfortable to freezing cold! All of the staff we encountered were polite and helpful. We did find however that concierge were not knowledgeable about transport options to an out of town retail outlet. We ended up taking a cab (approx $20) because we had been advised there were no alternatives despite us asking specifically about the 'deuce bus' which runs up and down the strip ($3). We later discovered that the deuce bus was indeed an option. Our biggest concern was that on one occasion we returned to our suite after a full day out, to discover that our suite door had been left open. However, when we raised this and our other feedback to Dino, at check out, he immediately credited our account to compensate the issues we had experienced. This customer service was very impressive and left us feeling very positive about our stay.

The room was huge, and, as mentioned, had a great view. We headed to Albertson's a few blocks away and bought some groceries which were a nice change from the pricey restaurants of the strip.

The strip was a $5 taxi ride away, but it was enough to make a difference.

The cons about the hotel are: no full-length mirror anywhere in the room (which is crucial when getting ready for a night out) Not a huge fan of the restaurant. the service is slow and the food is underwhelming. check-out was a little long. I didn't see anything about express checkout, and going to the front desk in the morning took about 20 minutes which was enough to miss my flight, so plan ahead.

Room was very good, lots of space, clean and very well appointed pretty much as shown on the hotel web site. The hotel is small (when compared to LV strip hotels) and has a more contemporary European style/feel about it. Walking to the strip from the hotel is possible but due to its location a car is a plus and the best option. The only minor issue is the valet only parking, at busy times the staff are not able to keep up with the demand resulting in long wait times and a call in advance often resulted in no reply.

We originally booked a pretty basic king suite (which is actually not that basic, except for that it overlooks the mountains instead of the strip). Upon arriving, we learned that we had been upgraded to a strip view for free - fabulous! This hotel is not right on the strip....it's about a 10 minute walk to the corner of Flamingo and Las Vegas Boulevard (which is the corner that houses The Bellagio, Caesar's Palace and Bally's). However, the view of the strip, especially at night, was really fun. The best way to describe this place is an upscale/glorified Hampton Inn. I say that because I actually find Hampton Inns to be quite nice for the cost. These rooms are massive, with large sitting areas and kitchens. The kitchen was well stocked - glasses, plates, etc - which was appreciated when I wanted a glass of wine. It didn't have a wine opener, but the staff managed to find one pretty quickly, so they scored bonus points for that. On the first day we wanted a late lunch and we opted for pool side service. The pool is pretty nice - nicer than a standard Hampton Inn pool for sure, but this is not The Mandalay Bay either. The service was excellent, but the food at the pool was not anything special. I ordered a Caesar salad with grilled chicken and my husband had a chopped salad...for the price of lunch ($40, including 2 beers), it disappointed us. The salads were pretty small - mine was mostly romaine and croutons - and the chicken was not the best quality. It wasn't terrible, but it wasn't worth what we spent. We were able to walk to the strip pretty easily, which was great - if you want to save some cash, this is a wonderful place to stay. For roughly $200/night in savings as compared to some of the nice strip hotels, I can walk myself a few blocks, thank you very much. Here is a tip, though - walk THROUGH Bally's (enter the Flamingo Street doors) - in the heat, this is a really nice short cut to the strip and Paris hotel. Overall, we were satisfied with this hotel, especially for the price. We ordered room service Friday night when we got home around 2:00am, and the food was quite good - the cheeseburger and fries were tasty. The macaroni and cheese was a little fancy - I mean, at 2:00am you want your Kraft mac and cheese, not the fancy white stuff. But, it did the trick and was fast. Definitely don't stay here if you are looking for a mega resort with a casino on the ground floor.....however, if you are looking for a clean and spacious place to sleep and shower (which is basically all you need when in Vegas), the price cannot be beat. The kitchen is a fantastic addition if you drive (which we did) - we were able to have cold water, diet coke and wine at our disposal with no ice buckets and hassle. The bathrooms were clean and more than ample. My only complaint is that the towels and sheets could be of a higher quality, but if they upgraded those, this place would be even nicer. It is non-smoking, which is much appreciated. The clientele tended to be younger (seemed to be a lot of singles - groups of girls or guys), but it wasn't loud or dirty. We ended up having to leave abruptly on Saturday night because of my husband's work, and they managed to get the car for us quickly....they never did send anyone up for the bags, but we handled it in two trips ourselves. When I got home, I realized I had left my precious perfume, and they did call us back right away and said they'd mail it to me (at my expense of course). Overall, though, I recommend this place as long as you recognize it for what it is - a nice place to sleep and shower and maybe even hang out at a cost much lower than what the premium strip hotels command. They did manage to get my perfume back to me, which is quite admirable, in my opinion. How often do you actually get something back when you leave it in a hotel room? However, the guest relations people did not even attempt to appease us with our emergency departure....I just wanted some sort of concession - either a half night's stay removed (since we didn't spend Saturday night), a gift certificate to the spa, a free night for our next return - anything!!! They made no effort whatsoever to help us, though....which was very disappointing, especially since they were extremely rude in the process.", "Date": "May 2, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Carp", "Title": "\u201cFirst trip to Vegas-Wow!\u201d", "Author": "Missy46", "ReviewID": "UR15533008", "Content": "Fabulous Hotel, huge room, comfortable king bed, wonderful hottub in bathroom, huge kitchen, beautiful balcony, can't say enough.

After much research we decided to try the Platinum because of their spacious floor plans and relative low cost compared to the Paris and other hotels within easy walking distance of the Platinum. Two of us were sharing a 2 queen \"princess\" suite booked with a \"strip view\" Arrival: Front desk competent and very professional - Free required valet parking in the parking garage right there on site (more on this later). We got there at lunch time - room wasn't ready but we were cool with that - decided to have lunch at the restaurant on floor four. Let's start there... On Site restaurant: I was impressed with the prices - most hotel restaurants on/near strip are outrageously priced for less than great food. Server recommended an excellent wine. Over the course of our 3 night stay - we ate at the restaurant often - my only complaint was the service while good was slow at food delivery. The Room: Where do I start - they gave us an end room on the 16th floor with strip view - if you come here - request a high floor with strip view - it's worth it - every room has a spacious balcony that can easily sit 4-5 people comfortably. The room was terrific for it's size - large sitting area, huge bathroom - well equipped full kitchen. The only problem we had was the Big Screen plasma tv in the living room didn't work. It was 3pm on a friday and we called 4 times for engineering to fix. We had dinner reservations so we had to go and found out on our return they \"needed to order\" parts - would take a few days to fix - they were full up so they offered us some dining credit and 50 bucks off a night for our stay if we chose to remain - we figured that was fair and honestly we were gonna be not watching tv as our main activity. I will give this hotel major props for how they handled this problem. We found out later all they needed to do was a seven hour reset but regardless - the management handled it fairly and professionally. VALET PARKING Free, required and on site. I got to say we never waited more than 5 minutes for the car and without notice. They were excellent LOCATION We had a rental car to pick up friends at the airport and outside of bar hopping - we used it often. However you can easily walk to the Balleys monorail stop or the Strip itself - it's about half a mile i guess - I wouldn't reccommend it for high heels though :) The location of the platinum is ideal for people looking for a place that they can access the strip with a little walk or quick cab ride or drive. There is no gambling, smoking at the hotel and they handled a bunch of rowdy guys like us with class, professionalism and we cannot say enough about how they made a great weekend for us.", "Date": "April 29, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Blackpool, England", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel - loved the trip to the Grand Canyon!\u201d", "Author": "Julesp2008", "ReviewID": "UR15392723", "Content": "My mother and I have just returned from a 5 night holiday in Vegas, staying at the Platinum Spa Hotel. What a fantastic place! The room was everything you could wish for - very spacious, clean and best of all - no smell of stale smoke. Hotel staff were very polite and helpful. Due to the Platinum being a small hotel (by comparison to the hotels on the Strip), we were in the hotel reception area within a couple of minutes of leaving our room, (all 3 lifts working every day with no problems whatsoever). The walk to the Strip was a pleasant 10 minute stroll (Bally's/Bellagio at the end of the road). For weary feet at the end of the day, there is a bus stop at the side of Bally's hotel where you can catch a deuce bus and just one stop away you can be dropped off right outside the Platinum Hotel. The deuce buses run the full length of the Strip. We travelled south to the Luxor Hotel (the IMAX theatre and ride inside the Luxor were great), and north as far as Fremont Street (the dinner buffet at Fremont Hotel was excellent value for money). One deuce bus journey costs $2 ($1 for seniors and children), or $5 buys you a 24 hour pass - well worth the money! The highlight of our holiday was a 3.5 hour trip to the Grand Canyon, booked via the internet with Sundance, (an extremely organised company and a very knowledgeable pilot). We were picked up at the hotel in a stretched limo and taken to the airstrip, a 45 minute helicopter ride to the Canyon, over the Hoover Dam, landing on the floor of the Canyon for some great photo opportunities and a champagne picnic lunch, then a 45 minute ride back, flying over the full length of the Strip - fabulous and not to be missed!! Our only disappointment was we didn't get to see the Bellagio fountains - if it's windy (and it was windy when we were there), the fountains do not operate. There's so much to see and do in Vegas - on our trip we only scratched the surface, so I guess we'll have to start saving for a return trip!!

The only negative: We had a fairly late check in at around 9.30pm which for some reason took ages- the guy at reception wasn't overly friendly and was tapping away for what seemed like an eternity. He asked us if we wanted to upgrade to a large room with a washer and dryer for another $30.00 a day- we said no- as we didnt really think we needed a washer dryer for an extra 30 bucks for every day! So after more tapping on the screen and no conversation he then said that he was putting us in the suite with the washer dryer for no extra charge- most likely because they didnt have one of the smaller suites available...that kind of annoyed me because he had tried to get 30 dollars extra a day from us- and then gave it to us for nothing anyway- as they didnt have our pre booked and paid suite available! i asked if there was a room with a strip view and was told that would be an upgrade- ie you have to pay more- and actually I felt our mountain view was more inspiring- with all the construction on the strip the strip views from the Platinum really only cover the back of Ballys and Planet Hollywood as Bellagio is obscured as is Paris Las Vegas! Having a full kitchen is brilliant- we stocked up on groceries at the local Albertsons and was able to have breakfast each day in the room...saved a few bucks and actually there are only so many buffet breakfasts you want to eat! The balcony was great as it meant a brief respite from the interminable air conditioning found throughout Vegas and the double sized jacuzzi bath was a great touch! The kitchen came with plates, cups, bowls, cutlery and toaster, coffee maker and kettle, microwave- really top notch! The large fridge freezer had an ice maker on the front which was great for evening drinks before heading out on the town! Housekeeping was efficient- they would fill the dishwasher with any crockery used so when you got back in the late afternoon it was ready to unload! The washer dryer actually came in handy too as we have arrived home and have no holiday washing to do! I would definitely recommend the Platinum- it reminded me of a swish New York Hotel- and for the price we got we loved it! One last point- there is no self parking- it is all valet parking- we found the parking guys to be efficient and friendly-and we never had to wait long for the car....made a change just going down in the elevator, getting the car and driving off, whereas with some of the larger Strip hotels you have to spend 20 minutes walking out of the hotel and finding your car!", "Date": "March 27, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco", "Title": "\u201cGreat experience at the Platinum\u201d", "Author": "Gonowwally", "ReviewID": "UR14527702", "Content": "The Platinum was a great experience for us.

You can't get away from the strip and casino craziness if you don't get off the strip, so the 10 min. walk is actually about perfect.

Upon my return, the staff seemed to be really concerned and walked me to my room. Sorbet was delivered on the house shortly after! I felt much better (iv fluids and anti-nausea drugs and a 3 hour nap are magical), soaked in the giant tub, cleaned up, put on a dress and went downstairs. They drove me once again in the house car to Caesars. The next day I was treated wonderfully at the nearly empty pool after a brisk workout in the empty, spacious workout room. I took over a lounger made for two and read my geekly books. Highly recommend the grilled chicken sandwich from the cafe! The service poolside was fast and excellent. Later on the pool filled up, but I headed to the room to get ready for another night. The entire trip was like this for me. Everyone seemed to know I had been sick. I was honestly treated like I was a famous person or something. Normally I'm not into that sort of attention and would feel uncomfortable, but for once in my life I just soaked it up.

For those seeking a frentic Vegas strip experience and want to party all night, it's probably not a good choice. First thing, the rooms are terrific. Spacious, new and homelike, all the rooms have separate bedrooms, full kitchens, huge jacuzzi tubs and balconies. Some of my colleagues were upgraded to larger rooms with clothes washer/driers and gas fireplaces. These are great rooms for extended stays that allow you to unwind, put stuff in the fridge, and even make your own meals if you get tired of going out. Mine was on the strip side of the 17th (top) floor, so the view was pretty decent too. The downsides have already been written in other reviews -- the hotel is a long block off the strip, it's tough to get a cab and the u-turn back to the strip is annoying (maybe faster to walk through Bally's actually), service (especially room service) can be extremely slow, there's no casino nor huge choice of restaurants like you'd find in a strip hotel, there's only valet parking, it's strictly no smoking and the hotel is generally kind of quiet. Depending on your preferences these are not all bad things. I would recommend trying to stay higher than lower in the hotel for both the view and the fact that there's some construction going on at the AM/PM directly underneath on the strip side. We rented the \"boardroom\" for a day meeting and were impressed with the amenities, service and food offerings. They have both wired and wireless LAN, although you have to pay for it. The bar, which had great service, was a nice place to unwind after a full day, and at the time they were running a \"free\" $50 bar tab if you bought an entree in the restaurant. Pretty good deal! I did not use the workout room or pool but heard they were decent.

Prices are starting to inch upward, as expected, now that it is more known, but IMO, still by far the best value for upscale luxory accomdations in Vegas. All the comments on this site about the rooms themselves are on the mark. Simply incredible. Think new luxory apartment w/ a view; don't think in terms of hotel rooms. Distance from strip has its pros/cons (as discussed in previous posts). To each is own, but for us, the pros far outweigh the cons. I see on trip Advisor that they received a couple negative reviews now. One related to overbooking. That sucks when that happens. I know hotels and airlines do that all the time. Unfortunately that risk exists at every hotel. Also saw a negative review about getting charged for evidence of smoking in the room. Obviously I have no idea if the Platinum was right in their accusation or not, but I do know that The Platinum takes their no smoking policy extremely seriously. My advice would be not to stay here if there is any chance someone in your party may break down and try to smoke on the balcony or in the room. And even if you have cigarettes and don't intend to smoke them, keep them out of sight in the room so cleaning people don't see them and get suspicious. I know this policy might be a turn off for some people. But to me, I love how serious they are about this policy. Its one thing to be around smokers when out partying in a bar, but that awful smell in hotels and houses from previous smokers is a HUGE turnoff. Having a Washer/Dryer in the room is a great convenience too. The unit-mart next door allows you to take advantage of having some food drink in the room handy. The bar, exercise room, spa, and room service are all very good to excellent. Not cheap (other than the exercise room which is free), but nothing in Vegas is cheap. The cab situation is better than in early stays, but still can be a wait at peak times. Not any longer than at the big places (like the Bellagio for example), but pschologically it may seem longer as there is not a line that is constantly moving like at places like that. But when all is said and done, the wait is basically the same. During peak times, i suggest ordering the cab through the bellman and then getting a drink in the bar and waiting there. The bellman will get you when it gets there. Just don't open a tab. Pay or your drinks when you get them and ask for glasses/cups you can take w/ you in case the cabs gets there real quick. The Bellman are FANTASTIC. Will do anything to help you out. Much better that the other larger places in town. One gripe I have is the price of Internet access. I am used to it being free. I can even expect paying a couple bucks, but they really stick it to you here. I think it is $13/day or something. That really seems excessive to me. TIP: you can usally tap into some free wireless networks if you have a decent wirless router on you laptop.

We drove to shows at the Venetian and Wynn, both about 5-10 minutes away by car. The jetted whirlpool tub was heavenly, as was the comfortable bed. One note of advice though, fill the tub up all the way before starting the jets or you\u2019ll have water spraying all over the place! We were in the room so much that we missed housekeeping one day, but a staff member came by at about 5pm and offered housekeeping service. Although we didn\u2019t accept, the thoroughness was impressive. The only uncomfortable aspect of the stay were the police sirens throughout the night (a few blocks away but distracting nonetheless), and construction noises from a former gas station below our window starting at about 7am.

The curtains are nice and heavy to make the room dark. The hotel was quiet, though you could hear music on Saturday night, but only for a few hours. The bar, Stir, is very open to trying a wine before committing (I am somewhat picky). The restaurant bartender and waitstaff were very attentive to our needs (we were in a rush for a show). Two thoughts on the food: Beef is done extremely well, sides are not overdone, but the salmon was a little run of the mill. The valet guys were very attentive to our needs (especially when in a rush). Great service holding our golf clubs and retrieving our truck, hailing a cab, or firing up the Escalade.

You can catch the Deuce ($5 for 24 hour pass)--a bus that runs up and down the strip (best way to get around the strip in my opinion, taxi rides around Las Vegas get pretty costly--and cabbies will take you all around the world for a ride if they know that you're not a native of Las Vegas!). I did not have a problem with walking to the strip. From Platinum to the Venetian (where I had to go for a conference) it was about a 20 minute walk. The staff was attentive (they brought me towels, soap, body wash and shampoo quickly when I called for it). Gita at the concierge desk was an absolute angel--very helpful lady!

I never would have considered this off-the-strip hotel if not for its rating here on TripAdvisor, and boy am I glad we checked with TripAdvisor, because this was the best hotel I've stayed in for this price (and for considerably more). First, it's a suites-only timeshare. Before you stop reading, this is not a sales-pitch for a free stay kind of time share -- the units are already owned, and they're rented out like a regular hotel. Except the rooms are very spacious, they have full-size refrigerators, a small dishwasher (which housekeeping runs for you if you use any dishes), real hair dryers and irons... almost like home. We stayed in the smallest of their suites, the Solitaire. It was quite ample for me, my wife, and our four-year-old son, who slept on the pull-out sofa. You can check out the Solitair floorplan on the Platinum's Web site [---] The staff is the friendliest I've experienced, and the on-site restaurant is excellent. We arrived Sunday night about 12 hours ahead of our bags, so when we showed up at the restaurants in rumpled clothing (me in a Tee Shirt), I didn't expect to be greeted with smiles and the most gracious and friendly service of our whole stay in Vegas. The food was marvelous, and we took our \"doggie bags\" upstairs to the fridge for a late-night snack. The hotel is very close the the strip, but given the crazy Vegas traffic I was glad we had the rental car so we didn't have to manage crossing the intersections on foot.

Cons - It is not on the strip and it really isn't within walking distance (well, we always drove). Also my friend (who paid for the room) was harassed. There was a private party at the pool one night so they had people at the elevators in the lobby directing everyone. I came through and didn't show them a room key and the guy even push the elevator button for me. My other two friends didn't have any problems at all. Then the last of my friends showed up at the door with one of the employees from the hotel (not the same one I saw at the elevator) and asked if we could vouch for him since he didn't have a keycard (he had given them to us so we could get in the room ahead of him). We said yes but the man was very rude (I should have gotten his name) and came off as totally racist. Then they charged us a different rate than we reserved the room for.

My submission will probably end up being too long anyway, but here it goes\u2026 Our first impression was not that great. We took a taxi from the hotel to the Platinum and the valet area is very small and difficult for vehicles to navigate. We got there around midnight on Friday and surprisingly the whole valet was packed with cars and people. Since everyone was busy, we hauled our own luggage into the lobby. The adjacent bar was packed and since the music was loud, it was difficult to talk to the desk clerk. Although my group booked two princess suites at the same time, we were put on different floors. My room was fine. My friend\u2019s room was not cleaned. When they complained, they were given a new room and comped for breakfast. (This comp was later changed by the daytime desk clerk to $50 off each of our rooms). The room itself is as advertised in all of the previous submissions and photos. It was basically a condo. It was nice to have a full sized kitchen and refrigerator. There were a few glasses, plates and silverware to use if needed and having a fridge with an icemaker on the door saved us from having to run down the hallway to an icemaker numerous times. The living room was very large and the plasma TV was a nice change from the usual hotel sets. Our fireplace was not gas and did not have real flames. It simply had lights that appeared to be flames. We didn\u2019t care because we never turned it on for anything other than to look at it. The king sized bed was very comfortable and it had some very heavy and thick sheets and covers. I was able to crank up the AC to 68 and it was nice being snug under the covers. The AC worked great \u2013 although it was unusually cool for Vegas that week and I wondered how the AC would fare in much hotter weather. The Jacuzzi tub, as stated before, was very large and easily fit two people. The drain stopper was a pain to use and it would come undone if touched slightly. Although the marble two sink countertop was large, my girlfriend found a way to completely fill it with her beauty products. I read that the shower was small in size but I found it to be more than large enough. The water temperature was just a bit too cool as I could never get it as hot as I would have liked. It was even cooler during the morning hours and I did not enjoy showering in lukewarm water. Perhaps it was because I had the room so cold? Housekeeping cleaned the room adequately, however they never replaced the shampoo and body wash the entire time we were there. Because we brought our own, this was not an issue. There were two full sized closets, one in the bathroom and one in the bedroom. While we did not use the clothes washer or dishwasher, there were packets of laundry detergent, dishwashing detergent and dryer sheets. The dryer came in handy to rid my clothes of the wrinkles sustained while packed in my suitcase. The iron was better than most others I\u2019ve used in hotels. The front desk clerk in the evening was completely lost. Aside from not being able to offer a solution to our in-room internet connection not working, his answer to my inquiry if the pizza delivery guy could come directly to my room was \u201cI dunno\u201d. I ended up meeting the delivery guy in the lobby, eating my pizza and going to bed. We ordered breakfast the following morning. I ordered an omelet and my girlfriend ordered French toast. It was pretty good by hotel food standards and we were satisfied. The internet was still not working and after calling the 800 number provided for guidance, we discovered that someone jammed the Ethernet cable upside down into the outlet. Maintenance came up within 30 minutes and pulled it out of the wall, however we were now forced to use wireless internet and still charged the same $12.95 a day. It wasn\u2019t so bad. Since there is not a whole lot to do inside the hotel or directly around it, I cannot add any insight to the rest of the hotel\u2019s services. We did not visit the pool, the restaurants or the spa. The walk to the strip was not the greatest since the cars travel pretty fast on that stretch. It takes about 15 minutes to get to Las Vegas Blvd. Most of the time, we took a taxi to various parts of town. On our final morning, I called the front desk to see if we could have a late checkout. The clerk recognized that we had some issues upon check-in and allowed us to stay in the room until 1pm. As mentioned above, she also took off $50 per room. Although this hotel had a few setbacks, we would stay there again. It was a nice change from the usual casino atmosphere and it probably saved me a few hundred dollars as I usually gamble while my girlfriend takes two hours getting ready. Instead, I just grabbed a cold beer from the fridge, turned on the plasma and watched some TV. Want to save a lot of money and get a great breakfast? Walk around the corner to the Ellis Island Casino. It is this little dive of a place but the food was cheap ($13 for both of us) and very good.

There are no large buildings around it and it\u2019s also conveniently located a block off the main strip so there is far less traffic, getting to/from the airport is quick. Entrance to this hotel is easy to miss though (small driveway entrance eastbound on Flamingo Rd.) It\u2019s about 10-minutes to walk to the strip (a cab ride to/from the Bellagio in traffic is < $10+ tip) Check in was quick, friendly, and efficient. It\u2019s a non-smoking hotel, not easy to find in LV. Internet access available (for a fee) Lobby was small with 3 check-in desks, a bar to the left, and elevators to the right. Got a Princess Suite with a view of the strip and pool below from the balcony and from the huge bedroom window. Although the strip views are of the backside of the strip, it\u2019s still a great view at night.

The suite also had a 42-inch LG flat screen TV, Bose wave radio/cd player, gas fireplace, washer and dryer, separate bedroom TV, safe, robes, and typical hotel toiletries (shampoo, lotion, etc.) AC was nice and chilly but fan was a bit noisy. Sound insulation was good, heard no street, pool, or hallway noises (we were on a high floor though) Decent quality linens and king bed was not overly soft. Morning paper was provided every day. Restaurant was nice with modern d\u00e9cor and booths. Had the usual breakfast items on the menu, great service, they do not serve poolside.

The rest of the bathroom is very roomy, with two sinks and shower (a little small, but very nice). The kitchen was also a nice amenity to have in our suite, it definitely saved us money on breakfast and lunch as we were able to cook ourselves, but the hotel does NOT provide pots and pans so we had to buy some of our own. We didn't use the TV's that were both in the living room and bedroom, but they seemed really nice. The suite provides a lot of closet space which is always nice and having a washer and dryer in our suite was great. We loved the balcony, very spacious and a great view of the Las Vegas Strip. We had a few mishaps when we first arrived with the valet service, but hotel management took care of that issue for us and let us park our truck ourselves for our entire stay and also offered a complimentary dinner or spa treatment. We decided to eat dinner at The Platinum Restaurant and enjoyed their ribeye steak, sauteed mushrooms and aspargus, but their mashed potatoes were horrible, the crab cakes were completely delicious and so was their asian crunch salad, after all that we didn't have room for dessert so I can't comment on that part of the menu. The staff at the restaurant was fabulous, very pleasant and attentive to our needs. Unfortunately there were some foolish people that were staying in the hotel the same weekend as we were - they decided to have fun with the fire extinguishers on the 16th fl. and set off the fire alarms and we all had to evacuate the hotel at 4:00am. We were staying on the 17th. fl. and had to walk down all 17 flights of stairs, which is horrible when you are half asleep. Of course we were happy that the fire alrams do work and warned us to evacuate, because if it had really been a fire we would've been more than happy to run down all 17 flights of stairs to safety! Finally getting back upstairs and to sleep we woke up a few hours later to realize that the pools (both indoor & outdoor) were completely closed due to someone throwing bottles and glasses from their balcony out to the pool area. Once again we realize that this wasn't the hotel's fault and they have closed the pool for our own safety until the glass has all been removed from the pools, but this put a damper on our stay as we were looking forward to go into the pool for the day!!! Finally sometime in the late morning/early afternoon we were allowed to go into the pool, once this happened we had so much fun that we forgot all about our bad experience with the valet service, fire alarms going off in the early morning hours and the pool being closed for the morning! For the nightlife - well since there isn't any gambling inside the Platinum Hotel we walked over to the strip, which isn't a far walk at all. We enjoyed the different hotels, which we've seen plenty of times before and went back to nice non-smoking, non-gaming hotel of Platinum and enjoyed the rest of our stay. All and all we enjoyed The Platinum Hotel and Spa and would definitely book the Princess Suite for our next stay in Vegas. Everyone has to realize that no matter where you stay you are going to have issues. Everyone can't be happy all the time and no one can make you happy all the time, but you just make the best of what is handed to you and put a smile on your face and keep going. You make the best of your stay and you'll be guaranteed a great time, because remember your trip is all what you make of it. We could've sat and sulked all day and weekend long, but we didn't!!!!! Never go off of someone else's bad comments because they could have a completely different outlook on life than you do and you are letting them dictate your vacation. If I would've wrote this review right after our issues at Platinum this would've been very negative, but now that time has passed and I have thought about everything I realized that we enjoyed ourselves 100% and are planning a trip very soon!!!

Pool and other common areas often close early for Platinum's promotional parties - guests are not notified of closures. Extremely problematic as Platinum is not designed for such gatherings: insufficient parking, elevators and parking spaces. 2. Housekeeping shows up only sporadically. Be vigilant. 3. Platinum's web page may not agree to your actual reservation. If you request a King room their records may show Queen. Make your reservation online, then call to verify accuracy. This is a fantastic property - a diamond in the rough, but beware of the above items. An absolute bargain and the rates are sure to skyrocket. 1. We stayed 5 nights and the pool was closed three times without notifying guests. On our last night, they held a promo party for 300 people causing all kinds of problems: jammed lobby, 45 minute elevator waits and 1 hour valet delays. Guests were very upset. This hotel is simply not designed for such events. We have never experienced such closures or debacles at ANY hotel - ever. 2. With their housekeeping, you never know if they are going to show up or do anything when they do show. We called and requested housekeeping several times to no avail. I recall they showed up one time in 5 days. Fortunately, we really do not need daily cleanings. 3. When you request a particular type of room from Platinum's web page, there is absolutely no guarantee you have actually reserved or will receive such a room. When we reserved a King Room I noticed the confirm was lacking details, so I called the facility to confirm. Their records reflected a Queen Room and we were told they were sold out of King Rooms. Perplexed, I went online again and booked another King Room for exactly the same dates (the rate ended up lower!). Again, I called the Platinum and got exactly the same information/story: Queen reserved and King sold out. I explained what I had just done and they checked their web page, contacted upper management, etc. and we were able to get what we actually requested. Quite a fiasco and hassle. It is possible this problem has been corrected, but based on our experience with the Platinum, I doubt it!

We thought The Platinum was excellent value for money and so much more space for what you would otherwise get on the strip.

What I liked: The hotel was quiet and free from smoke, as advertised. Every hotel person I encountered was very warm and friendly. The room was clean and recleaned daily. The hotel had upgraded my room to a view of the strip on the 14th floor- best view I've ever had in LV! I highly recommend the 14th floor with view. My husband and I sat on our balcony and enjoyed the spectacular vista of color and lights. The apartment itself was beautiful and very roomy. I liked having a kictchen and not having to leave in the morning to find breakfast. My husband and I had a couple's spa treatment that included a mud/steam application. That was the highlight of our stay- our masseurs were excellent and the atmosphere was very, very relaxing. Another plus was that several recommended restaurants (east of strip) were a short driving distance from the Platinum, including Paymon's Mediterranean. The food was just as fantastic and way less expensive than any of the meals we had on the strip. The Atomic Testing Museum is also a short drive from the hotel and worth a visit. Another plus- even though it was very hot, the walk to the edge of Ballys is short. As others have stated, you can walk through the casino to get to the monorail or to the escalators over to Bellagio, Caesar's etc. We walked to the Mirage in 106 degree heat to see Love and found it very doable. What I didn't like: I arrived a day early to gamble (husband doesn't like to gamble) by myself and found that being two long blocks off the strip was not safe at night. The strip itself felt very safe but right off the strip I observed quite a few unsavory looking people who made me nervous enough to grab a cab at Ballys. Another con is that if you rent a car (a must if you're going to get groceries or avoid walking to the casinos) the parkingt is valet only--meaning each time you use your car, you'll need to tip the nice valet men. My husband was less impressed with the wake up service. The first morning the desk called us a full 30 minutes late. The second time the desk called a full 10 minuites late.

That's what you get at the Platinum (the units are for sale.) The spacious 1,000 SF suite I stayed in was well-appointed, attractive and comfortable for an amazing $159 a night. A few standouts were the 2-person jacuzzi tub and the crisp HD picture on the plasma tv (unlike the plasmas at the Hard Rock, where I had a snowy picture on two separate stays.) The public areas are modern and cool, and the staff was friendly. I travel to Las Vegas frequently on business, and I don't care that much about staying in noisy gaming hotel. It's only a $6 cab ride to any of the casinos on the strip. It was great to be able to spread out in a condo. I wouldn't hesitate to stay there again. Now, about the restaurant. It is a wonderful restaurant...if you aren't too hungry. My coworker and I had spent a long day at a trade show and were famished. She ordered a salad ($8) and an appetizer-portion of bass w/ artichoke, butternut squash, and Shitake mushrooms ($20). I ordered the entree size bass ($32). Her beautifully presented salad was about 6\" long and 3\" across, with two quarter-sized dollops of puree of something. The busboy came by and doled out a small ciabatta roll to each of us. When the wait for the fish stratched to 30 minutes, he took mercy on me and granted me another roll. I ate half, because I didn't want to fill up on bread. Then our food came out, and our waiter, placing the plates in front of us with a flourish, said, \"Here is your PETITE bass, and here is your ENTREE bass.\" I looked at my fish, and I looked at her fish, and to the naked eye, they appeared to be exactly the same size. \"Sir,\" I asked, \"Is this the entree-sized bass?\" \"Yes,\" he answered confidently,\" Your piece is larger and fattier.\" Fattier? I looked at the plates again and saw two identical 2 1/2\" X 2 1/2\" pieces of fish. I was too tired to argue the point, so I just ate the fish, the few tablespoons of squash, and the 3 slices of Shitake mushroom. (The artichoke, if present, was invisible.) It was delicious. Unfortunately, after the 3 minutes it took to eat it, I was still hungry. Luckily, I had snacks in the kitchen in my room. I had a similar experience at one of the Wynn restaurants, so small portions may be a trend at the better Las Vegas eateries. Don't let it put you off the Platinum, though. There are lots of great places to eat in town.

Was a little worried due to some previous guest concerns but was extremely pleased by what I actually found. Stayed Friday night, May 18 in the Solitaire suite... no check-in line at 6pm. Got the Strip view upgrade. We walked in and were stunned by how big it was - expected more of a Flamingo-sized room (ie, big enough but not extravagant). The suite was very well decorated - felt right at home. Well lit. Great a/c system, though yes, in the king suite the vent will blow on the bed... but we like it chilly). Bathroom was quite nice, loved the jacuzzi, beds very comfy. Loved the view from the balcony; we were on the 10th floor looking down the street towards Bally's and Flamingo. Ordered late night room service and was pleased, though I did think $40 for two 12\" pizzas was a little extreme the next am... then again, I was fairly tipsy when I ordered... :) Ate at the Resturaunt Saturday am - great food! On the expensive side compared to home, but hey, it's Vegas. Had a couples spa treatment Saturday am. Ladies, my guy traditionally is not a spa-goer, will get a massage every now and then... but even he was impressed by the facility! It's dimly lit with browns and blues color scheme. Ladies room was very nice - personal locks, full assortment of toiletries, water and towels everywhere. Very helpful staff! The Rejoice package was GREAT: it's a DIY scrub (we had kiwi-coconut) and mud application - had a blast \"painting\" each other with mud. You're in your own room with massage tables and a seperate shower and sauna area - after we were done scrubbing and painting, we sat in the sauna, then showered off. To finish, we had a 50 min massage... best massage I've ever had and that's saying something! Very pleased by the whole session :) I would recommend checking in with the front desk early and confirming each portion of your treatment - somehow it wasn't communicated to the therapist that I preferred a deep-tissue massage, but it was a very very minor thing and easily rectified :) Pool area is a bit small but we went out around noon - 2pm and there were still plenty of chaise lounges and we were able to snag a couples lounger (big mattress thing). Seemed like the service was very attentive (we didn't want anything); the waitress was busy rushing around :) I don't recommend Vegas for families with kids under the gambling age, but if you have to bring them along, this would be a good place to do so - suites are quite large, easy walk to the Strip, heck, make your own meals to save $$. Would also be a great place for groups - we saw several bachelorette and bachelor party groups there. Thoroughly enjoyed the stay - have been recommending it to all my friends. We even got to speak with the manager during breakfast - he made sure we were having a good stay and was very keen on making sure any problems were rectified...
