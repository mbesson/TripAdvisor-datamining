That really is my only criticism. The complimentary breakfast was okay on my way out the door and I appreciated having coffee and juice available in the lobby around the clock. The best part about the hotel was the staff. Stephen at the fron desk went out of his way to help anytime I needed information. He researched movie times, mall addresses and provided concierge service comparable to that of better hotels I have stayed at. Cannot comment on the pool as we didn't really use it... Looked clean. Would stay again and if you're looking for a convenient spot at a reasonable price I would definately recommend.
