We had 1 spoon, 1 teaspoon and a couple of serving spoons, not many cereal bowls and only \"china\" cups as coffee cups.....It was just my husband and I, so we did not need a lot of silverware or dishes, but I did request more spoons. Wi-fi was NOT good at all in room. Lightbulbs out in bathroom....On the PLUS side, location is excellent. It has all the amenities one needs. Everyone we encountered (staff) were exceptionally nice and helpful. Rooms are quiet, which we loved. We would stay here again because of the location and amenities. We had stayed here 5 years ago and did not have those \"room issues\".....'hopefully, we will get a better room next time. We loved the beach area with the chair and umbrella rentals right out of the pool gate. We stay at a lot of condo's on the beach and I don't know if the hotel can stop it, but we had a VERY ANNOYING woman ride up on her bicycle as we were sitting under our umbrella. She did not work for the Wyndam. But, she did not understand what NO means. She wanted us to go to a \"presentation\" at another area re: hotel rentals. We could not get rid of her......the next time we went down, she came back!.....We told her again, WE WERE NOT INTERESTED!.....she said we did not have to be interested, just show up .....she was sooo pushy, this put a damper on going to the beach.

So as I always do I'll take u from pull up to check out. It's in a great location central to all that is Daytona. As we arrived we were greeted by a guard that guided me to the check in desk. Once there I was greeted by a really nice lobby and an equally nice receptionist who made short work of the check in process. I mount my noble steed and I start my trek up the turns of the parking garage.

I open the door and was greeted by a pleasant smell and well decorated room with small stove,fridge,micro,and all the comforts of home. Being tired from the travel it was bed time I crawled into a very nice kingsized bed a sleept like a very tired baby. I wad awaken by my son saying dad come on let's go of course its 7 am at this point I roll from my slumber nest and put my trunks on don the sun block and away we go. We start off at the lazy river which was empty at 9 am but the kids didn't really love it sure it was fun but the tubes that you have to use are for adults not 6 and 4 year old frames so when seated in the proper relaxed floating position they would fall through the hole in the center of the tube which meant they would have to take this journey aboard the SS daddy that's right they road my back as I road the tube...its ok you will figure it out in a minute anyway not the most fun activity. So.we moved to the muddy splash pad also empty at this time we had fun here some of the spray nozzles were broken or wouldn't turn off but not something the kids paid any attention to we played here for a good hour before the water slide open at which point of course won over the splash area the slide is nice a pretty low speed but you do have to be 42\"tall to ride it dumps into the shallow end of the pool with plenty of picture taking room for all of us parents that are crazy like that.

Lots of entertaining activity. We are Wyndham owners, so we only book through Wyndham using our points, we've never had a problem in the 13 years we've been staying at this resort.

There are units that are rented out on the internet, etc. (This seems where a lot of problems happen, overbooking, downgrading, etc.) And using traditional Wyndham points (this is what we do). We've always had a good experience, always got the room we booked. There are 2 towers. Each tower has a different security company, confusing. The pool is always busy, so we save up and rent an umbrella and chairs for the week, and stay on the beach everyday. You can get in a pool anywhere. This is a Timeshare resort, not a hotel, there is no maid service. Most units have a washer/dryer. We stay in a one bedroom deluxe unit, very spacious, whirlpool tub, full kitchen. This is an area that you can park your car and leave it parked all week. The only time we got in our car was the first day to get some groceries from Publix.

The staff was great, the room was very clean, and the location is excellent, but the place itself has gone downhill and is much in need of updating. For right at $300 per night you just have to expect much more for your money. First off is WiFi isn't available in the rooms. Today there is just really no excuse for that. Even low rent motels have WiFi in the rooms now. It's available in the lobby only, but when you are 22 floors up, that's a hassle. The room itself, while clean and comfortable was in need of several repairs. The mattress was simply worn out, not particularly comfortable and broken down in the middle. The wall outlets in the bedroom, and a couple in the living area were broken and loose in the wall. Finally got the electronics plugged in in the kitchen to charge. Lastly we had a two bedroom room, counting the three beds and the sleeper sofa, that room could have slept 8. Regardless of that only one parking pass is allowed for the room, so the other people with us, who came in a second car had to park away from the hotel in public parking. In the past we have had two cars in the parking garage for the room, but this time we were flatly denied by the night shift desk clerk, who was the sole exception to my statement about the staff being great. Mentioning the number of people the room can sleep, it's also a problem that the kitchen is only stocked with glasses and dishes to serve four.

The view was not as good as ocean front, but still not bad at all. The room had everything in it that we would ever need, always does. The deck area.....Well, on a summer weekend, if you are not on the deck by 8am, you are going to have trouble getting a lounge chair. This July was busier at the resort than our last visits. Of course the beach is always available. We like how they have security making sure that the kids do not get too crazy in the river and around the pool. Bonnet Creek in Orlando could learn a thing or two from Ocean Walk. Also, I hate when one person comes down and puts towels on 5 chairs and then goes back upstairs for 2 hours. We asked the guards about this and they said they cannot do that, but they did and no one said a word or moved any towels off. I guess people will do it as long as they can get away with it. Another thing, the pool bar closed early every day. This makes no sense to me. Come 8pm, there would be countless people who would want to sit on the deck, have a drink and relax. They are losing money and the guests are missing out on a nice amenity. Other items.....Yes, wireless internet is only in the lobby. This visit, we really did not use it. We were just there to chill. The kids liked the karaoke in the bar at night. The kids liked the free indoor putt-putt when it got too hot or rain was threatening. Lazy river is always nice.

When I complained to the management they referred me to head of housekeeping (a contract company) who is off site. The first time no one showed up. The second time, the lady said she had only been on the job a few weeks and that she was short staffed and that the units are obviously not cleaned properly and need to be renovated. She made no offer to rectify the current situation, but complained about the shortage of permanent housing she could rent to keep her job on the island!

When we left that morning, we complained again to the \"resort\" management, and the Asst Mgr asked us what we wanted him to do as he was not responsible for housekeeping! I wanted at least a substantial discount on our room, if not a refund since we drove 6 hours to get there and there was not an alternative place to stay. In addition: 1. The Mini golf course was old, flooded, mildewed and had leaf/dirt litter all over it. 2. The pool had to be closed at dark, as the Security guard told us know one had bothered to fix the pool lights in quite some time... 3. Two units on our stove did not work, not did the garbage disposal. In fairness, they did send someone to fix those. 4. The toaster burnt toast on one side, even on the lightest setting. 5. They gave us metal cooking utensils to use in Teflon pans. You can imagine what those looked like! The Asst Manager said he would \"have to check with head office about a discount/refund\" since we had pre-paid. It is now a week later. Do you think I have heard anything back?!

We had a wonderful 2 day vacation and a beautiful oceanfront room. When we checked in we were asked if we would like to go to a time share presentation and accepted. They scheduled it for July 21, the day we checked out and gave us a late checkout. Our presentation was 3hours and 15 minutes instead of the 90 minutes they said it would be. While on tour of the resort our sales rep stopped at the front desk and reconfirmed our late check out. When we arrived at our room, after the presentaion, our keys had expired and we had to go back to the front desk and have them remade. Upon arrival back to our room it had been cleaned and everything we had left in it was gone. Before the presentation my husband had taken most of our belongings to the car so we would only have to make 1 trip after the presentation. I had left my bag, which had every thing I had brought with me, including make up, hair blower, curling iron, swim suit etc. etc. etc. We contacted security, housekeeping and night mgr. After 3hours of looking for our belongings they said housekeeping had thrown my bag down the trash shoot. There was also sunglasses and a thermos cup left on the kitchen counter that were never taken to lost and found. They said not to worry, I would be taken care of. The only time they communicated with me was if I called or e-mailed them. Each time I did they responded in a timely manner. After 2 weeks of waiting for a compensation check I threatened to come to the hotel and meet face to face with the Mgr. They immediately sent out, not a compensation check but a Wyndham Gift Card in the amount I had listed for the things I had lost. This was just another inconvienience because most of the things that were taken from me had to be replaced immediately and I can't use the gift card to pay for my purchases. Nothing was offered as far as a stay at the Wyndham for our inconvienience or that we might have a more positive experience. Just a note saying sorry this happened. Customer service is very important to me. I will stay at a 3 star hotel before a 5 star hotel if the customer service is better.

We used our timeshare for this stay. This is our 3rd stay at this property and first time staying in the summer, typically we have gone in the spring. We stayed in a 1 bedroom Deluxe room on the 23rd floor. As you've read by other reviewers the check in process is indeed atrocious. We arrived around 11 am on a Saturday. Knowing we couldn't check into our room we were given a temporary key until we could come back at 4 to receive our room. We stayed the day at the beach and finally came back in around 4:30 to get our room key. Wow, what a mess! The place was busy when I first arrived at 11, but once we came in there were lines, for regular check in, lines for early check in, and lines for VIP check in. This must be a common problem, since they had face painting for kids, and popcorn, and soda for all the people waiting. We waited in line for an hour to get our room after I had already waited in line earlier for the early check in. Ocean Walk has some pros and cons, it's a nice property and could be great if they managed the property better. I'll list my pros and cons. Pros: Fantastic beach, soft sand, clean beach, ocean has great waves for boogie boarding and ocean is clean no rocks or sea weed. Great location, easy walking to restaurants, boardwalk Nicely appointed rooms, updated, clean, fully stocked Cons: Check in process Reception staff could be friendlier and more accommodating Elevators - every day there was a line to get on the elevators. Maybe it was the time of year we stayed, but this place was packed. There were no chairs at the pool, so we ended up staying at the beach and renting chairs for the week. There were families everywhere, us included. So, if you're looking for a couples or friends trip you may want to stay at the Hilton, or the Royal Shores next door. Both properties look nice. *Tip Hire a bellman upon check in and check out, this is worth $5. We couldn't find a cart upon check in and had to wait forever for the elevator. The bellman have a service elevator they use. We called for one upon checking out, very friendly and helpful man. Also, if there is a line at the elevator use the stairs and go up 1-2 floors to catch, or walk up it's quicker.

I recommend the welcome information meeting to find out info about the area and some great coupons. The cons as most people complain about were there were rarely a pool chair available but ok with me since I am more of a beach person anyway. If you came in late from an outing you could be out a parking spot and have to pay to park across the street. The elevator situation is annoying but I never had to wait that long and I quickly found the stairs instead of using the elevator. The last annoying thing is I was in the south tower by the restraunts and bars and could hear the music until 2 am. It didn't bother me but it did my husband.

This area offers such great outdoor options and the beach is one of the cleanest and safest(lifeguard right in front of the resort) we have been to. As far as the Ocean Walk, it is good...there are a few things they could work on and over the 7 years, they have kept it up considering the number of guests that stay here, but it is showing wear. As to some of the complaints I read, when PARENTS don't watch their kids how is that the hotels fault? We have seen them talk to parents and ask them to STAY with their kids and the parents get all upset...this is not a daycare facility. We are here during high season and the pools are not full...lazy river is busy, but if we wanted a pool and lazy river, we would have gone to a water park not paid to have a room on the ocean...Next... security/staff... does remove towels...if you wake up and watch the woman with her 8 towels run to the chairs cover them up then leave, you would understand first, why the security moves towels, second, if security is busy chasing down that woman ( who is the same one not watching her 7 kids) she is taking up 8 prime spots and then if you wanted to be by a pool (and not the ocean?) all the chairs appear to be full...then she doesn't come back to the pool until after lunch...sometime staff gets short, but i would too if i had to deal with some of the people and their actions...we fly with a big duffel bag with our own lawnchairs, boogie boards and skim boards, take them to the beach kick back and ENJOY ourselves!! There is LOTS of open space! To conclude, if you are looking for 5 star and want to be waited on hand and foot, this is NOT the place...if you are looking for a FANTASTIC beach location with kids...we would recommend the Ocean Walk.

Well, needless to say we went back downstairs to let the front desk now that this was not acceptable and they needed to do something. Well, all we got was, we can't do anything because it is not our property. I told them your room or not there should be a standard because this property is representative of the facility as a whole. We were able to use a vacuum to at least clean the floor and we got some clean sheets.

I can honestly say that I was terrified before we arrived, I read the reviews and thought to myself \"SELF-you can find another hotel on the beach if you need too.\" BUT I will almost venture to say that the Ocean Walk was the best I saw on the beach...It is right next to the Hilton hotel which is HUGE but still not as Family oriented as the Ocean Walk. Our Room was suite 1602 A it was a handicap room with an Ocean Front View. The suite was clean, beach chic, and spacious! FYI Guys this is a FAMILY destination resort. So you will experience a lot of children and family. Don't be alarmed.....YES there is a line for the elevators just as there is traffic on the express way when you get off of work. No big deal, after the first day you'll know how to schedule you elevator rides! Your suite features a fully equipped kitchen so there is no need to complain about there not being any restaurants in the hotel. The Wyndham is attached to the Ocean Walk village and features many options for food or snacks. My favorite thing about this hotel was that I felt like I was home. I don't like to use the word cozy because people generally think small. The Wyndham Ocean walk was cozy in a grand type of way. I loved it!

We are not spoiled adults as we have to save all year for a vacation. I wish we would have gone somewhere else. To begin, upon arrival we had to stand in a long line to check in. This took a little over an hour. We then had to go to yet another desk to schedule our \"tour\" of the facility. We DO NOT do this; you do not have to, but you do have to go through that line to receive your arm bands for the pool. After traveling all day, we were exhausted. We arrived at our room and discovered it was NOT an ocean room delux, which we had reservations for. I had called the Tuesday before our arrival date, and I was told that yes our reservations were in the system and our room was what we were down for. I was told to go back down to the reservation desk and they would help me. Well guess what? I had to stand in an hour long line AGAIN! We DID NOT get our ocean delux; we had to stay where we were and they stated they gave me a better room than what I had! We were NOT the only people they did this to. One owner had made reservations in December and he did not get his ocean delux. So many people we spoke to had this problem! They are screwing the owners over and putting \"prospective\" buyers in these rooms. We had rented our good friend's condo here, and they are trying to sell it. Our room was nice, but not what was reserved. We were on the Atlantic Avenue side. There are 25 floors for each tower and only 4 elevators! One could wait 20 mins. for one of these. We learned to ride up just to ride down to our floor! Everyone complained about this constantly the entire week we were there. Furthermore, they speak of the 3 hot tubs; good luck getting in them. They are filled with junior high students and younger. The pool is always crammed packed and not enough chairs to accommodate everyone. I am telling you it is packed! I teach school and I love my job, but I am definitely not going to back to this family resort! The kids overrun the facility, and of course the parents just let them run alll over. Don't go to Sloppy Joe's for drinks. There is a restaurant called Wings in the walk way and the drinks are $3 CHEAPER and better. Way overpriced! As far as location in Daytona, it is very convenient. I have been to Daytona a dozen times and from this location you can walk just about anywhere. Go to the movies on Tuesdays in the walk way because the cost is only $5. On Friday night the little amphtheatre has local bands that play. Take a short walk to the Oyster Pub; they have happy hour and fresh seafood. You can walk to Froggies and Boot Hill for some local good times. Facing toward the coast there is an IHOP about one and a half blocks north and also a convenient store. Make sure you go to the Deck Down Under. You would head south to the Dunlawton Bridge and go under the bridge not over it. You will see it to the left. it's a great place to eat and you can watch the dolphins feed in the canal. Good food and cold beer. All in all we did not let the room hinder our vacation, but very disappointed in their attitude toward us about that. There is a ton of stuff to enjoy in the Daytona Beach area!

You are in for the runaround day from hell. I book the weekend 1 bedroom condo. Didn't know it was going to be in a hallway with no view of anything. Like a dorm in college. I walked in and it was like stepping in to the Odd Couples apartment. Old TV's, old furniture, cushions on pullout couch don't fit couch, and old king size bed. The only thing new was the dishwasher. I tried to live through it, until one of the remotes for the tv didn't work. Tried to call downstairs and both phones had static or no service from the jacks. On a static y line, I put in a request to fix. Maintenance didn't come till next day. I was not happy. I wanted to change room. Policy was I had to go back to website and get new room. I did. I called and got confirmation for a new room facing the ocean for $44 extra, from online provider (Not bad) i I come back and the rooms are sold out, although it showed available.

When I come back, the hotel parking lot is FULL! I had to park my brand new car, overnight in the public garage across the street! But, the worst part is the elevators. OMG. They take forever! On top of that. How bout, somebody pulls the fire alarm in the bldg (may be bad kids) I had to walk down to the lobby using the stairwell from the 21st floor!. And if you think I am giving the hotel a hard time. How bout the fact, that you can't hear the fire alarm from your room! You only hear it in the stairwell on when you get on the elevator. Can we say \"Safety\". Last but not least, before I spend $260 per night on a terrible one bed condo, there. Go down the street to The Shores Hotel or somewhere else. I had 4 star quality.

The Pluses - hotel is right on the beach and next door to a small shopping center with movie theater and restaurants. A short walk to the pier and great views of the ocean(ask for a room with the ocean view...not all rooms have it) The rooms are great for a family.

We had some bad weather on our trip so the indoor pool was a sight for sore eyes. Great security and the beach area is wonderful. They inflate a large slide for kids to play on the beach. There are food trucks on the sand and a small board walk steps off the hotel. Love it! Minuses - We had to change rooms because the safe in our first room was broken. It took them close to 2 hours to resolve the matter. If you have a problem...dont call for asssitance on the phn...go to front desk and ask for manager right away to resolve your problem. I just think there is a shortage of staff for such a large resort. Upon check in you have to go to pick up your beach towels for your stay. They give you one towel per person for your entire visit. Now keep in mind...if you loose these towels your have to sign your life away. They expect you to wash and dry them for your stay there. Tip - bring your own. You can wash them everyday in washer if you have to. They say they have free wifi...but only in lobby area and business center. There is not much to eat on site. The elevators are always full and very slow. So be patient if you plan on staying here. They have 3 hot tubs. One was not working and the others had cold water.

When I got to the property, they couldn't guarantee the number of beds that I needed.

Try sleeping 4 people in that arrangement. They moved me to an inside room -- beware. There aren't any windows -- well except one that looks into the hall. The hall light is on all night and the shades over the 'window' don't provide any shade. We could see out and people could see into our bedroom! Plus the light in the hall way was a bother when we were trying to sleep. Oh yeah --the kitchen! Well if you call a cupboard with 3 glasses, a drawer with 6 pieces of silverware, a stove that is crooked with four burners the size of a coffee cup a stove, well then there is a kitchen. The kitchen spanned a total of maybe 3 feet!. And one more thing... if you are needing to use the elevator (which most rooms do), plan to wait for 3 elevators to pass before you can get into one. That isn't just the day you check in (expect to wait 20 minutes to get an elevator on check in or check out days) every time we had to go up and down we had to let 3 elevators go by before there was room for us.

While our stay was mostly OK, there were several things amiss, mostly just annoying little things. Having read numerous reviews beforehand, I was a bit apprehensive as to what we would actually find upon checking in. Many reviewers cited mold in the bathroom, which we did not find. The general traffic areas in the elevators and areas around them were persistantly damp, however given the pool/beach traffic and the general humidity (it rained quite a bit ), doubt much can be done about this. Some of the positives are also negatives: the place is crawling with very young families with oodles of small kids--it is a great place for this, but starts to grate on your nerves a bit. Creates lots of elevator traffic and you wait forever. The decor is pretty outdated, really in need of some updating. No restaurant on site, only a little snack bar w/hot dogs, chips, etc. The bar appears to be nice, good drinks, nice place to hang out, drink specials were very reasonable ($2.00 beers). The garage is pretty well located, you have in/out privileges, so no having to tip a valet. Check out time is rather early, 10am, which is a pain if you are lugging around a lot of belongings, or have teens who are slow moving in the morning. Upon our arrival, we had NO towels. We requested and were brought the towels--one per person- pretty skimpy, however I didn't ask for additional, we made use of the dryer for damp ones. They do not replace, you are expected to launder your own, and they will provide extra detergent for that. There is no \"maid\" service, and not much in the way of cleaning supplies-could've used a broom (only had one of those push-sweepers) or spray cleaner. The kitchen was great, we tried to fix breakfast most days, a grocery store close by. Would have been nice to have been provided some salt and pepper shakers--no one wants to bring/buy this stuff. Having a washer/dryer was super--brought detergent from home. Nice to not have dirty clothes or wet towels. Beach towels are handed out extra, btw, also used for shower towels when we were short. The unit was unplugged--had to call maintenence guy to come move it and plug the thing in, though. We booked a one-BR ocean front--super, super view, loved the balcony. The sofa sleeper (cheap, 2 or 3 in mattress) basically is not useable--my daughter slept on it one night then moved to the xtra bed-- my husb and I crammed in the other double. Not much closet or drawer space--a must for a week long stay with dance costumes. Also the owner's belongings were locked in a large cabinet in the bedroom, taking up more of the already cramped space. Get the feeling there's lots of partying misbehaving--security hovers around the pool, harrasing people to show their plastic armbands (which we were not told about)--I get why the need is there, but really, we were a bunch of adults, 45-60 years or so, how much trouble could we have caused??? Still had a good time, beach is great, lots of decent, fun restaurants nearby. Prob would not stay here on my own--its def. not a HOTEL, its an ownership property, and they do try to rope you in to hear the sales bit.", "Date": "July 8, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Overland Park, Kansas", "Title": "\u201cWas Disappointed From Day 1\u201d", "Author": "Marisa H", "ReviewID": "UR133749724", "Content": "This place is a dump.

When I booked this hotel, I was soooo excited. It seemed like the perfect mini vacation for my family. When we got there, we checked in and went to our room. It was awesome and overlooked the beach. They had 2 pools and a lazy river. We immediately got dressed and headed down to swim. It was what seemed like the perfect start of a perfect weekend. We had rooms side by side with my in-laws. When they got there to check in, they got their room key. When they went up, they found there room was not cleaned. Since it was around 4/5PM in the evening, housekeeping could not get their room ready, so they were moved, to a different floor. One of the TVs was missing a remote and when I asked about it, they said there may not be an extra one. I told them, no biggy and left it at that. My husband was more concerned about reporting it so we would not be charged for a missing remote. As I was taking a shower, I noticed a TON of mildew/mold on the inside of the shower curtain. It was not just a day or two amount. It was weeks. It was covered from top to bottom and beyond gross. I pushed it out to the outside of the tub so we would not touch it. After all 4 of us took showers, there was a ton of water on the floor since the curtain was now on the outside. I now felt like the whole room was dirty, so I would not let anyone use any of the dishes in the room. When we came back from dinner, I asked for a new shower curtain along with towels to dry up the floor to be brought to my room. (I also asked for a remote because by then, I was curious exactly what type of customer service they had). She said everything would be sent up soon. About 15 minutes later, someone came with a remote. Then about 45 mins later, I called down as no shower curtain or towels has been brought up. We had to be up early for the gymnastics meet and I was getting upset by then. Finally a lady came. I answered the door, and she handed me the shower curtain. I asked her if she was going to hang it, she gave me a big sign, a rolled eyes and said \"I guess\". I explained there was no way I was going to touch it (by now, I was pissed) and I showed it to her. She kinda gasped and then understood why I refused to change it. She did apologize. I asked her where the extra towels were, and she said she had not been asked to bring me any. She would be back with towels. She never returned. I went to bed. The rest of the stay was just \"okay\". Unfortunally, it was ruined by what had happened the day before. It should have been great. We did have fun, they have a ton of great things to offer. But my frustration from the day before and how dirty I felt the room was, really really ruined it. A few days later, I called and asked to speak to a manager. The one on duty was busy so they gave me a voicemail. I never received a phone call back. About a week later, I called again and asked for the actual hotel manager. I was told there was a bunch of people in from corporate and the manager could not come to the phone but if I left a message, I would get a call back. Maybe not that day because of the meeting, but I would. I never did. I was going to go directly to corporate, but I have not yet.

Check in was a breeze. Less than 5 minutes & I was parking the car. (Full Disclosure: After a traffic nightmare, we were nearly two hours late, so that may very well account for my easy check in) As luck would have it, we were placed on the 19th floor of the south tower. This is the top floor of that building, so no pesky footsteps above us. The room was clean & spacious. I had requested two doubles & received one king bed, but that was not a deal breaker. The bed was a bit too hard for my taste, but there were plenty of pillows. The view from the balcony was breathtaking! I could have sat there staring out at the sea for hours...and the first night, I did. The kitchen was well stocked with all the necessary items needed to prepare meals. The living space was quite comfortable & my daughter enjoyed the large flat screen for morning cartoons before hitting the pool & beach. Now, the pool area was very nice, with the exception of several small areas with broken concrete surrounded by caution tape. For what is charged to stay at this resort, there are no excuses for these oversights & they should be repaired posthaste. Because I do not enjoy fighting to the death over lounge chairs on the pool deck, I spent most of my time on the beach. The chair situation at the pool is totally out of control. Plus, they allow smoking poolside and I don't enjoy second hand smoke while sunbathing. None of this mattered once I was on the beach. Once night fell & my daughter was sleeping, we enjoyed sitting on the balcony & listening to the surf. There were several groups of young adults staying a few floors below us. They were having a great time, playing guitars & singing, and were quite good. This didn't bother us at all, but I know some people would not appreciate the show interfering with their serenity. So, book this resort knowing that there is a significant amount of partying & alcohol consumption that may happen in your general vicinity. All in all, we had a great time here. Our room was comfortable & clean, if not luxurious. Do not expect soft beds with high end bedding. Knowing all of this, should we choose to return to Daytona Beach, we will most likely stay at Wyndham Oceanwalk Resort again, provided we were able to stay on one of the uppermost floors with a large balcony because the noise level & partying would make our stay in a lower level room too noisy & disruptive.", "Date": "June 26, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Las Vegas, Nevada, United States", "Title": "\u201cSleeper Sofa is not a bed\u201d", "Author": "Shari U", "ReviewID": "UR132754351", "Content": "We are a family of 4; 2 adults and 2 children ages 9 & 16.

There is a Publix grocery store about 3 miles north, which was nice because it saved us a lot of money on eating out. There is also a Walgreens a couple of blocks away. For the beach goers, there are rental companies on the beach that rent 2 lounge chairs and an umbrella for $30/day. If you're staying for an extended period, I would recommend purchasing a tent or a beach umbrella and a couple of chairs. There are rental companies that also provide bikes, boards, etc. For those who prefer poolside, MAKE NOTE of their policy on saving chairs. I've been to many resorts and am accustomed to getting to the pool early, saving a few chairs near an umbrella/shade and leaving for a couple of hours. You are not allowed to do this at this property. If you reserve lounge chairs with towels, magazines, etc. and decide to leave, you must return within a half hour or they will confiscate your belongings and you will lose your spot. Unfortunately, umbrellas are very limited, so if you require a little shade (which we all do in the summer heat), get in line early. Security/Cleaning crews will not let you into the main pool area until 8:15am, but the lines at the poolside doors usually started forming around 7:30am. They could have done a better job of making guests aware of their unusual policy as I did not find out about it until I was \"caught\" leaving my saved chairs one morning.

First, I will list the positives of this resort: great location and great view. And the negatives..... We checked in and I jumped in the shower. The shower curtain had mold on it. Not a small amount of mold. Mold spots in many different areas. Dark mold. It was disgusting. I have never stayed in a hotel or resort with a dirty shower curtain like that. I finished my shower, careful not to touch the curtain and called downstairs. After two attempts of the phone ringing and ringing, someone finally answered and said someone would be up to room to change in 30 minutes. Someone did arrive and change the curtain to a new one within the promised time. However, this was a bad start as if black mold is on the shower curtain, how clean is this place? I also noted that there were only TWO washcloths for our entire 3 day stay. I called down and was told that the linen truck comes late and we would get our washcloths after the truck came in. We did receive several washcloths the second day stuck on our door latch as we were out of room. The second day, my boyfriend went to open the sliding door to balcony and handle broke off. My boyfriend does not superhero strength. We walked down and told someone at check in and someone was up in our room within 30 minutes replacing the handle. I am not a snob. I don't expect everything to be spotless or perfect, but my impression after the experiences with the room was that there is absolutely no interest in putting any money into the property and keeping any updates to a minimum. One other comment, the hair dryer in the bathroom was a complete joke. I never thought I would be commenting on the hair dryer at a resort but this one was such a joke, I couldn't help but laugh every day I looked at i and think to myself, Really??? It was a tiny travel size model from early 90s with so much lint built up in it it would turn itself off after a minute. At this point, I decided to let my hair air dry the rest of vacation. I was done talking to the front desk. I had read the other reviews about the pushy timeshare salespeople. I do see the other reviewers' points. I didn't find ours too pushy as I laughed and shook my head at the 90 minute presentation. I 100% agree about the \"guest service\" area being a total joke and only caring if you showed any interest in buying a timeshare. After leaving this guest service area as they require you to go over there and get your pool pass versus giving them to you at check in desk, they all say oh and if you have any concerns or questions feel free to ask. Later during our stay, I asked where the parking overflow lot was and I was told, \"I dont know. Go ask someone at the check-in desk.\" Wow, there is no way that area should be guest services. You are not treated like a guest and they certainly are not there to be of service. Parking is very congested there. If you leave in the evening, count on parking in the overflow lot and that requires a visit to the check in desk. It is a mess there every time you pull in the resort as it is such a short driveway entrance and there is absolutely no communication, no direction of what to do when the lot is full. We couldn't find anyone so my boyfriend stayed in the car while I jumped out to go inside for what to do. Please look into other resorts as there are many others in the area. The Hilton was next door and looked great.

Upon arrival and check in, we find out that our room is not an ocean view room which was what we had reserved. Of course there weren't other rooms available so we were stuck with a room with a window that faced the interior hallway, which meant guests walking down the hallway could see right in. We felt like animals on display at the zoo. The entire night wa spent listening to kids and teens running and yelling up and down the hall. In the morning I noticed there was no coffee maker-an amenity listed in the room description. So I picked up the room phone to call downstairs, but it wasn't working! 20 minutes later, using my cell phone, I finally got thru to the hotel. I asked them to bring up a coffee maker and send a maintenance worker to chec the phone. A man came and said it was the phone line and it was an ATandT problem, and they probably won't come out to fix it Bc it was a holiday weekend. An hour later still no coffee maker so I had to go out into the hallway and use the phone near the elevator to call downstairs. I was told they ran out of coffee makers and I couldn't get one. As a consolation, the woman offered to bring us coffees from the restaurant and she did. Now off to the pool! When we arrive the place is swarming with guests and not a empty chair to be found. So we decide to go down to the beach. But first we need towels so we head back into the hotel for them and found out that they've run out of those too! They have no alternative for the guests but to go back up to our room and use the bath towels and keep checking back every hour or so for the next towel delivery. Well we did as we were told for the next five hours, but each time we did, they always said they ran out again. (mind you there was a huge bin of dirty towels sitting in the hall all day - no one rolled it away to wash them, though ). As we ended our weekend we still had no coffee maker, a simple request , a broken phone, and i had to continuously rewash our bath towels daily. I will NEVER return to this resort, solely due to the poor service. The hotel is ill-equipped to handle a full house of guests on a holiday weekend. No one knows how to resolve minor issues at all (come on, couldn't someone make a run to a local Walmart and buy a dam coffee maker?? Housekeeping needs to devise a better plan to provide basic pool towels to guests. And if there aren't enough pool chairs to accommodate guests, the hotel should at least provide more chairs along the beachfront so there is enough space for all. My suggestion to those who still want to go: be prepared or be disappointed.

The check in process was also a mess. I was asked for my car's license plate number, and, since I didn't have it memorized, I had to walk back out to the parking garage and write down my license number to complete the check in process. The rooms themselves were roomy and nice. However, I would have gladly exchanged the room size for a nice hotel room with personable employees and a property with some basic amenities. This property has no restaurant at all. There is pizza and salads available if you can find the lobby bar open. I was there around 3 o'clock on a Saturday afternoon and they were not open yet. I was told to complete the check in process I had to go over to another area to get my \"pool pass and welcome gift\". I did not want a pool pass or welcome gift so I went to my room.

There were no children in our party, and this place is all about family with kids. The only real amenities are the pools and beach access, with only a tiny, open lounge off the lobby and a snack shop that is the only \"restaurant.\" There are no shops, no spa, no business center, no concierge, no guest services, and none of the other things you might typically associate with a hotel of this price. It's a one-trick beach resort of very large size but very little dimension. Our room appeared freshly painted, and was clean and quiet -- this is quality construction. The balcony view of the ocean was truly nice. The kitchen had everything we needed to prepare our breakfasts, and a family having multiple meals in-room would find it more than adequate. The room also had its own washer/dryer stack. Downsides include the constant crush of people at the pools and the elevators, of which there are far too few. Be prepared to wait as long as five minutes for an elevator, especially during check-in/check-out times. The facility has far too few luggage carts and, without benefit of cart when checking out, I had to drag luggage for four (including my elderly in-laws' luggage) down a long hall to the elevator, down several floors, back down a long hall, and through the parking lot. When I went to the cart center earlier and was told there were none, the attendant said, \"we have many people checking out this morning.\" And the reason they are unprepared for that is what, exactly? The worst part is, as with the cart attendant, a staff that are mostly indifferent as to your experience during your stay. With a few exceptions, these people just shouldn't be employed at a resort. The worst offender was a very large, semi-blond woman working the front desk one evening. My wife had left her prescription sunglasses in the lounge area that afternoon, and had gone to the front desk to ask if they had been turned in. The large woman told her to come back later, as they were still processing check-ins. Fair enough. My wife returned about 8:00 PM to ask about the sunglasses again; the large woman asked her to describe them, and then said \"Nothing like that has been turned in.\" End of story. When my wife returned to the room and told me this, I went to the front desk; the large woman was occupied, and I quietly asked another woman behind the counter if a pair of sunglasses (I described them) had been turned in that afternoon. She called security, who brought the glasses to the front desk in less than two minutes. When I showed the retrieved sunglasses to the large woman, said that these were the ones my wife was looking for earlier, and asked why she couldn't have called security, she said, \"I'm glad you found them,\" waved me off and turned away. She could not have cared less whether a $300 pair of prescription glasses had been returned to their owner. WHY IS THIS TERRIBLE WOMAN WORKING BEHIND THE FRONT DESK OF A RESORT???? You'll find similar indifference from staff in other areas -- we heard plenty of people grumbling about very poor customer service while riding elevators.

The resort is kept up wonderfully and the layout is fabulous; and the concrete construction minimizes constant noise from others that you find in most condos. Of course, we enjoyed the oceanfront condo more (the view is priceless), but our experience (twice) is that housekeeping does an excellent job and the resort is updated nicely. The two outdoor pools and lazy river are beautiful and the two indoor pools are really nice in December (and good size). The resort is on a non-driving section of the beach, which is a plus.

There are two towers, the North and the South. Because we were there with a group, I was able to see rooms in the North, while my room was in the South. The quality of the rooms was good. I stayed in an \"efficiency\" or \"studio\" suite, which shared an entrance with another suite. I was not with the group that was in the other part of the \"lockout\" of my group of rooms, so I was slightly uneasy that the shared \"foyer\" could become an issue. I did not see or hear them while I was there, except for the door occasionally closing. The room had two double beds, a small dining area, small fridge with freezer, sink, two burner stove and a microwave. The quality of all of these was good. The TV was fairly new (flat screen) but not very large. The furniture was less than new, and the drawers in the TV cabinet/dresser were rather out of place. The bed that I slept in had to be moved out a little to get to a usable electrical outlet, and the bottom of the frame was exposed, which became a hazard for me as I walked past it several times and bumped my shin. The bathroom was a standard hotel room bathroom with shower, tub, sink and cabinet space underneath. The towels were very new and soft. The room also had a balcony that had a view of the street as well as the beach and pool areas. There were two chairs and a small table on the balcony. I would give this resort a 4 out of 5 because in comparison to some beach front properties I have stayed at, this one was relatively up to date, clean, and had good service. There was entertainment in the evenings, as well as an in-hotel \"eatery\" and bar. Having restaurants, shops and a movie theater next door was an added bonus. The only negatives that I could share about the hotel would be the following: The elevators were not sufficient to handle the crowds during busy times in that they were slow and not large enough for people's beach gear, strollers or luggage carts as well as other passengers. The noise from the street was somewhat ridiculous with people's car stereos setting off car alarms in the garage day and night. (not really the hotel's fault, but something to keep in mind for the location). My room key was \"de-magnetized\" several times while I was there. If possible, carry a spare with you or you will end up making extra trips to the lobby when you are in a hurry to get into your room.

This is the 3rd time I have stayed at this resort and it never disappoints. When we checked in, we were assigned a room in the south tower (old section) on the beach, which was nice, but when we walked in, ouch, it was not that nice. The unit was way overdue for a rehab, we found broken closet doors, faucets that were really loose in the bathroom, the dining room table was sticky and the unit just felt dirty. We went down and talked to the front desk and they accommodated us, by moving us to the 25th floor of the North Tower (newer section). Our new unit was great, still needs to be updated a little, mainly the furniture that was not very comfortable, but not as bad as the south tower unit we were in. The 25th floor unit was on the south end of the building, it had a balcony facing the beach from the living room and another from the 2nd bedroom that faced the beach and the river, best of both worlds, amazing views from either. I would say the only real complaint I had with this unit, was the shower head in the 2nd bathroom, it was very bad and needed to be replaced. Overall the unit was very comfortable, had everything you needed, even though all we needed was beer, chips and snacks, we ate out each night, what do you expect from a couple of guys away from home, no wives or kids. :-) The location of Ocean Walk is good, the connected Ocean Walk Village area is a nice perk, you don't have to walk far for food! Be aware that you only get 1 parking spot per unit, so if you are having multiple people driving in, they will have to park in the daily garage across the street, even if they are staying at Ocean Walk. I find this kind of annoying, as the units sleep 8 people easy, and if you have multiple couples, with their own cars, this is a problem. I see that during the summer parking could be limited, but during the winter there were many unused spaces in the garage, even for Speed Week, so I would think they would have some concessions that could be worked out. We will be back to Ocean Walk, as this is a great resort and is in a great location in regards to the Daytona International Speedway.

To begin on a positive note, the general hotel grounds and amenities are well cared for and we thoroughly enjoyed the two indoor pools, the outdoor heated pool, the hot tub (spa) and the waterslide. Although during our trip the weather was cold and windy we were able to swim in the outdoor pool that had the waterslide as it was heated to an agreeable temperature. The outdoor lazy river was not heated (I am told it is very hard to heat moving water and keep it heated so this is understandable) and we did not use it. Also, the kids area was not heated so my children played in the pool. The pools were open until midnight (YAY!) which we took advantage of by swimming on our arrival evening late with our two children. The pools were never crowded, although if you wanted a lounge chair in the sun you had better get out and reserve your chairs early. The indoor pools were also very nice, uncrowded and heated to a slightly cool temperature that was still comfortable for swimming. After returning to the lounge one evening we found that they were doing Karaoke in the bar/lounge area that is part of the lobby. The activity director approached us and asked my seven year old if she would like to sing. My daughter loves nothing more than to entertain so she took him up on his offer and he managed the crowd and her singing with care to make sure none of the \u2018rowdier\u2019 guests got out of control while she was singing (not really much of a threat since it was a pretty sedate group, but I was happy that he did it anyway. It was a positive experience for us and very memorable. We were very happy he approached us because we never would have thought to do it otherwise. The hotel staff was all very friendly and helpful. We did need to ask for some extra dishes/silverware and had a running toilet that needed fixed and all of these were given prompt attention. We found the location of the hotel to be very convenient. I think they push that being close to the Ocean Walk Shoppes is a great advantage of the resort, but really we found the shops and dining to be passable and used them more for the convenience of location rather than because they offered superior product or great value. Now for the negative: the room. We booked a one bedroom which is usually plenty of room to accommodate my husband, two small children and myself. The room did have a lot of space, but really lacked any thoughtfulness to the design. We really had no place to put any of our stuff away which meant everything was out in the open and we were tripping over it during our stay. Even something like this can be overlooked if the rooms in general are in good condition. Ours was not. We only had two cups and two spoons in our kitchen for four people (we called and we were given more), there was no dishtowel or anything of the sort and really when they say in their description that there is a mini kitchen they are not kidding, there was barely room for one person to turn around. There was no dining table in the room, just a small expanded area of the kitchen counter with four tall chairs around it (not appropriate for small children if you ask me). If people are sitting at the counter while you are prepping a meal your counter space is significantly reduced. Our microwave door was duct taped because the bottom section by the handle was broken, the burners on the stove were not attached and the burners would not work (this was easily fixed by my husband who is very handy, but I never would have been able to fix it on my own) the fridge door handle was very dirty and it looked like someone tried to paint the fridge and the paint ran and it was never corrected. The dishwasher barely accommodated the breakfast and lunch dishes from my family of four and we had to run it twice a day (I recommend bringing some extra dishwashing detergent). No big deal to run it twice a day, except it was really very loud. The appointments in the living area were old and outdated and appeared to be unclean. We found an old moldy tomato on the floor and gum stuck to the bottom of the counter (actually my five year old found them). While we didn\u2019t use the pull out sofa sleeper, it looked to be broken and was desperately sagging in the middle. The real problem was the bathroom. The mirror was so old that the corners were wearing and had no reflective value to them. There was black mold inside the handle on the shower and along the wall in the grout around the edge. There was no way I would allow my children to take a bath so showers it was for all. The shower curtain was just a curtain made of some silky material (no liner) that a) barely reached the top of the tub and b) was made of such a light material that when the warm water was on it created a draft which made the curtain blow in and stick to you while you were in the shower (and this was gross because that too was moldy). The toilet and sink top appeared clean. The layout of the bathroom was not well thought out. The door from the bedroom and the door from the hallway both opened in and took up most of the usable space in the bathroom. There was only one towel rack which was hung over the back of the toilet. Not only was this not enough space to hang wet suits and beach and bath towels, but if you drop anything off of there and the lid is not closed on the toilet it is heading right in! The beds were average and the pillows somewhat uncomfortable and hard. The TV in the bedroom was laughably small and there was an odd window to the HALLWAY in the bedroom?!!! The air conditioning unit was in the hallway closet and was really loud. If you have trouble sleeping with loud noises (it would circulate on and off so it was not steady and we found it disturbing whether you were in the bedroom or the kitchen/living area). We were on the eighteenth floor and the balcony was very nice and the view from it was excellent. The screen door to the balcony was broken so we really couldn\u2019t leave the door open. The layout of the room was absolutely nothing like the layout they have on their website. The kicker was we went on a tour for the timeshare. The room they showed us as a sample room was beautiful. Immaculate, updated and clean, it really only made me angry that I was paying for the junky room I had and at the same rate as the rooms in the north tower. I questioned our salesperson who assured me that only the rooms in the south tower were old, that Wyndham actually owned the rooms in the north tower while they only managed the rooms in the south tower and had less control over the condition. Really I was appalled that they (Wyndham) would put their name on something so trashy and then ask us if we wanted to invest a large sum of money with them to stay at their properties regularly. If the rooms in the north tower were all really that nice then Wyndham should be ashamed for renting rooms in the south tower for the same rate and it should be advertised as a \u2018lesser\u2019 selection. If the rooms in the north tower were not that nice, then shame on Wyndham for being so misleading in their sales pitch! We did ask to be shown another room and were told that there were none available (I kinda doubt that since it was the first week in February). All of this was such a shame since all the common areas were well maintained and the resort location was so convenient. The only reason we didn\u2019t leave was because we were not in the room very often and spent most of our time in these common areas or out and about in the Daytona area. Sorry Wyndham, you won\u2019t be getting any recommendations from me and I surely will not be staying at any of your properties any time soon. I can handle a room that needs a little updating, but I cannot handle dirty to the point of disgusting along with dishonest business practices.", "Date": "February 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Covington, Georgia", "Title": "\u201cAre there two Wyndham Ocean Walk Resorts??????\u201d", "Author": "Ed S", "ReviewID": "UR124521768", "Content": "We (four of us) stayed at Wyndham Ocean Walk from Feb 5th through 12th 2012.

I had a one bedroom apartment but it was dirty and dusty. The sheet had a small tear in it while the bed spread had a great big rip in it. The worst thing, though, was that the decorator had obviously got bored in the bathroom because apart from the one poor covering that really didn't do the job of hiding the previous colour, on some areas, the brush marks simply stopped midway leaving a two-tone wall. If there was any redeeming feature, the room was spacious with a good view over the ocean. I didn't eat there, but it's mainly self-catering anyway, and I couldn't wait to get away each day as my room suffered from noisy neighbours.

Most of the nice hotels were all booked up, but my mom managed to find us a room overlooking the ocean at the Wyndham Ocean Walk hotel. We\u2019d never stayed in a hotel like the Wyndham, so I wasn\u2019t sure what to expect. The best word to describe the Wyndham hotel was massive. I love staying in luxurious places that have many amenities and lots of things to keep me busy. Wyndham easily met my expectations. It was about thirty stories high, and the building was a lot of different colors in the front. It was definitely an eye catcher, even considering the fact that it\u2019s located in the busiest part of Daytona. The lobby\u2019s floors shined and the pillars that supported the ceiling were striped with vibrant blues and greens. If you walked out the back door towards the ocean you were met with two huge pools, two hot tubs, a water slide, an enormous blow-up slide, a snack stand, and the beautiful beach. You could rent umbrellas and lounge chairs down on the beach if you wanted to have some shade from the sun while you spent the day outside. If you walked out of the hotel and turned right there was a theater, shopping center, restaurants, a live band, and more. People were constantly out enjoying the sites and activities. There was even a carnival with rides down the strip if you walked far enough! There was never a moment during my stay at Wyndham that was dull. When the weather was nice my family and I would enjoy the pools, beach, and other things that Wyndham\u2019s resort offered. On the few days it rained in Daytona the inside of the hotel had plenty of activities to keep us busy too. There was a movie box where you could rent a movie to watch for the night, a game center, indoor pools, hot tubs, restaurants, golf, a workout room, and much more! The people that worked there were friendly and helpful; they knew how to make you feel welcome. The week I spent at Daytona Beach was easily one of the most relaxing and enjoyable weeks I\u2019d had in a long time. The stress disappeared as soon as I laid eyes on the ocean and the exciting things to do at the hotel. Being at the beach always brings out my best attitude, and Wyndham made it ten times better. If you want a family friendly vacation then Wyndham Ocean Walk would be perfect for you. My family thoroughly enjoyed it, although the weather certainly could\u2019ve been a little better. Going in the summertime might be better than the spring time; that way there would be almost no doubt that it\u2019d be warm and sunny. Have a fun vacation!

We had three separate families travelling together; we had an room next to my brother and his family, and my parents had a room with a view of the ocean, on the same floor. All of the rooms were very nice; we had a small diswasher malfunction when we entered our room, and maintenance came very quickly and fixed it immediately. They were friendly and apologetic for the inconvenience, we didn't have any additional issues during our stay. Check in was normal; not the fastest part of the trip but not unpleasant. They did ask us if we wanted to take the timeshare tour, and we declined; they were not unfriendly afterwards. My only complaint, in general, is when we tried to obtain more laundry soap, it took us two days. The front desk directed us to the concierge, who directed us to Housekeeping. Left the message with Housekeeping, who said they would bring it but did not. Called again and they told us to go to the front desk. Different front desk person sent us elsewhere - anyway, it was just laundry soap, not a big deal, but a little frustrating. The facilities were very nice - a couple of pools, hot tub, water slide, etc. They had activities for those who wanted to participate. I appreciated that they had an Under 18 computer room, and an Adults Only computer room - I did need to do a little work while travelling ,and with no wifi in the rooms and logged in on my computer in the Adults room. It was quiet and comfortable. I did notice, however, that of the three computers at the public computer bank, only one would print, and one of the others wouldn't connect to something. There was some frustration from those using those particular computers that they couldn't do what they needed due to those issues, or had to wait for the computer that did have everything working. I also noticed that people did have to wait to use a computer, although when I was there it generally wasn't too long - probably 15 minutes at the most. It seemed the guests using the computers did realize there was a line and took care of their business quickly when necessary. The beach in front of the resort is very nice; there is a very long stretch of beach to enjoy, so while it gets busy there's plenty of space. It DOES, however, get busy. The pools at the hotel also get extremely busy - it's hard to get a deck chair, and there are always a lot of people coming and going. We enjoyed being so close to Ocean Walk, as we did walk over and eat at several establishments over there. We're not big race fans, so we didn't spend any time in Daytona at those establishments. We spent most of our time just relaxing at the beach, and had a very nice time. We didn't find a ton of other activities to do in town (we visited the tropical fruit wine store, and the chocolate factory), but had a very nice time on our family vacation.", "Date": "February 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Denver, CO", "Title": "\u201cOK Property, Poor Customer Service Experience\u201d", "Author": "CO_Flyboy", "ReviewID": "UR123945660", "Content": "We stayed at the Ocean Walk during the off-season, mid-January, as an RCI trade.

We are Worldmark owners and booked a 3-night stay here as our first visit to Daytona Beach. We used it as a home base to visit St. Augustine about an hour north. However, the resort needs maintenance and the service needs an upgrade! It gets 3 stars simply for its good location. There is no Worldmark check-in desk, so even if you\u2019re an owner, you\u2019ll stand in line with everyone else who booked this resort online or via a travel agent. When I went to a side desk near the front desk to inquire about check-in, the person (Patti Richardson was her name) looked very angry and unhappy and said, \u201cThis desk is only for VIPs.\u201d I asked, \u201cI\u2019m a Worldmark owner. How do I know if I\u2019m a VIP?\u201d She said, \u201cIf you were a VIP, you\u2019d know. You can stand in line with the others.\u201d I don\u2019t mind receiving an answer I don\u2019t want to hear, but she could have cracked a smile. Looking back though, not only was she rude, but I am increasingly shocked that there was no check-in line for owners. Our wait in line was 25 minutes on a Friday night at 9pm. Not what we expected, and not a big deal on its own, but read on. Now for the room itself -- It was spacious, and I bet when the resort was new, it was probably a really nice space! All of the rooms were HUGE! The view was of the parking rooftop, and some of the city of Daytona, but it is what it is and I won\u2019t fault the resort for the poor view. What I DO fault the resort for is the poor maintenance and the fact that our room wasn\u2019t ready even after 9pm \u2013 - We were in room 1131. The kitchen was not stocked with any coffee, though the coffee filters, sugar, Splenda and creamer were in full supply. My husband went to the front desk on our second morning to pick up the coffee. He should not have needed to do that. The kitchen should have been stocked prior to our arrival. - The bathroom had no little bottles of lotion, shampoo, or anything at all. We were only supplied with two bars of soap. On Day 2, we went to the hallway, found a cart, and picked up the items we needed. This should not have happened. -The inside door handle to the shower was missing. Imagine stepping into a shower, and there is no way to shut the door. That\u2019s what we had to deal with every morning. Additionally, the plug was missing at the bottom of the shower door to prevent water from leaking all over the floor. So, after each shower, water dripped all over the floor from the bottom of the door. -The door stop opposite the front door was broken. It was literally just hanging on the wall with broken wood around it. -The garbage disposal in the kitchen was missing the rubber protector which meant when you looked into the drain, you could see the disposal. When we DID use the disposal, a red piece of plastic shot out of the disposal because that protector was missing. -On our final morning, we decided to take one last dip in the hot tub as we\u2019d done a couple of mornings before. However, none of the three hot tubs were working. Two were turned off and the water was lukewarm. The third hot tub was roped off. Another disappointment. -The kicker was when I went to take my final shower on our last morning and all four of the electrical outlets in the two bathrooms stopped working. The GFI buttons on the outlets were in the correct position, so we\u2019re not sure what happened. It was likely a problem with a fuse or the breaker, neither of which we had access to. My husband notified a maintenance worker in the hallway so he could address it, but I was completely undressed since I had just showered. To put a \u201cband aid\u201d on the situation, my husband moved the dresser in the bedroom to gain access to an outlet with a mirror so I could dry my hair and finish getting dressed. Our stay here included a comedy of errors from start to finish at this resort. We have never missed a maintenance fee payment in the 15 years we have owned Worldmark, and were disappointed in the apparent lack of maintenance and courtesy at this resort. It was not at all up to Worldmark standards, and we were extremely disappointed with this 3-night booking.", "Date": "January 17, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kendallville, IN", "Title": "\u201cOutstanding stay every time!\u201d", "Author": "bsu1999", "ReviewID": "UR123001121", "Content": "My family and I have stayed here 4 times and have thoroughly enjoyed each stay.

There is no question that it is probably the nicest timeshare on the beach but it is handled differently than the other Wyndham resorts. Many of the units have full-time owners who rent them out so there are not only timeshares but daily rentals, and also in the AAA book as hotel rooms. So there always seems to be a question about our reservation. The timeshare is, of course, a great deal for us, especially compared to the nightly rate. We have enjoyed very much the nightly stays available through the Wyndham points system. We have stayed there many times, most recently December 2010 and will stay again in January 2012. We have only been able to get to the front desk once when calling in advance and I always want to call in advance to verify our reservation, especially since they also have had, more than once, problems verifying our reservation once we were there. They only want you to call the regular Wyndham 800-number which is of no help for confirming our reservation onsite. There is also a long wait time on that line. Front desk people have not been very friendly. VIP desk seems to be no more with no early check in\u2019s and when it used to be in operation, we had to wait until after 5 p.m. more than once for our room to be ready. One time, when we had back to back reservations, which they assured us were fine; then security came to our door at 11 am. demanding that we leave immediately I had to rush downstairs to verify our dates, which of course, I had already verified upon check-in. A front desk person had assured us it was fine. Like I said, there always seems to be a \u201cquestion\u201d about our reservation. One reviewer has said as exchangers, they felt like a second class citizen. Well, don\u2019t feel so bad, owners are treated that way too. In that case, I don\u2019t know who would get a nice front desk clerk. Check out usually requires a long wait in line as well (while we are sweating out the 10 a.m. or else check-out deadline!) There is also always something in the room needing to be fixed, the most common the televisions. They are missing remotes, missing the electric wire, cable connections are twisted or actually broken off, and twice were not even hooked up to any wires; so now we know to check them right away since at midnight, when going to bed, when we find there is no television in the bedroom, it is not the time to call and wait for maintenance. Shower doors off rails, toilet seats broken, no kitchen wastebasket, dryer won\u2019t turn off \u2026lots of maintenance problems which may or may not get fixed the next day. One time, right after the Fairfield name was changed to Wyndham, there was no bedspread on the bed. The bedroom looked so strange; it actually took me a while to realize that the blanket was on top with the mattress showing below. I called to ask for one 3 days in a row, I guess they couldn\u2019t believe it either. Finally I asked if this was the new \u201cWyndham decorating system\u201d\u2026well, I don\u2019t think they \u201cgot\u201d it \u2013 but they brought a bedspread then! Most recently, the front desk person was not interested in any of our maintenance notes until we told him about the roaches we found. He perked up then! Apparently, they have changed the pool towels procedure from before, but it is still not ideal. They will charge you $15 each for not returning the pool towels but when you return them to the special office downstairs, the lady just says, \u201cThanks, just throw them out on the pile there in the hall. Goodbye.\u201d Well, I wanted some sort of receipt to prove that they had taken out the carbon copy of my name from their file, but she said No, could not get one, didn\u2019t need one. That makes me nervous. This to say that I am usually very happy even with non 5- star resorts, so this one seems so strange since as an obvious gorgeous 5 star resort, there always is an issue. Nevertheless, it is a beautiful resort, oceanfront, and art deco d\u00e9cor that will knock you over.

It is a beautiful resort-style complex. We walked and biked up and down the beach quite a bit, and as far as I could tell this has by far the best pool area in Daytona, with two large resort style pool and an awesome hotbub that overlooks the water. The pool water was a perfect temperature (although the lazy river water was cool). We got an incredible off-season deal from a private owner through VRBO. The Ocean Walk shopping area connects with the resort, and has a lot of cool restaurants and shops, and even a 10-screen movie theater. The Daytona pier area with the arcade and tourist shops is a short walk down the beautiful hard-packed sand beach. Unfortunately the pier is being renovated and is closed right now. If you want to eat on a pier or rent a fishing pole and bait, the Sunglow pier is about six miles down the beach. We went down there one day and drove back on the sand. it was a cool experience to drive on the beach. It cost $5 but was well worth it.

My husband and I lodged here from Thursday-Sunday based on a timeshare my aunt booked for us. There was complete confusion about the one-bedroom suite v. room and having an oceanfront room v. Standard room. There is a disconnect between the reservation line & the resort. The reservation line tells you to request an oceanfront once you arrive, however, the resort says they don't change rooms. The resort customer relations rep got involved and took care of the situation in a heart beat! He upgraded us to a 2br oceanfront that just had remarkable views of the water and boardwalk. We didn't partake in any of the resort activities because the room was just incredible! The only downside to this resort is that checkout is at 10am...most places allow a noon checkout so that was the only downfall.

It was definitley the off season so the hotel was full enough but nothing even close to overcrowded and annoying. After being there I would suggest going in October if you are a swimmer just to have a slightly warmer day. Now to the hotel, after reading these reviews I see there is a big difference in the way the timeshare owners are treated vs a general room booed through wyndham. It lookes like they have already seperated by floors with the timeshare owners getting better views, higher floors, and nicer rooms. If you want to stay here try to find a private owner that gives you pics a head of time. We went through a friends timeshare again, and had a spectacular time. This location and Waikiki were both very clean and comfortable. Everyone at the front desk was extremely kind and they spent time with each guest, so I didn't mind the wait because when it was my turn they gave me the time to answer my questions. The room was very clean, we stayed in a two bedroom corner condo. It was hard adjusting to washing your own towels since this is not a normal hotel but a timeshare. But the washer and dryer were efficient and it actually was nice to know nobody was entering our room to clean when we were gone. We had four adults and two children and we felt very comfortable. The condo is plenty big enough to hold us all and not have that clausterphobic feeling. The pools were very nice and at this time of the year were not overcrowded so even more enjoyable. The location to the beach could not be beat. We went to the beach everyday even though it was windy. For eating, we used our kitchen a lot which had tons of pans and utensils to cook any meal. If eating out, I would definitly recommend the steak house at the Hilton, the restaurants at the little shopping center that are attached to the hotel aren't exactly the best. If Im going to pay $15-$25 per plate i want to be satisfied. One thing they don't exactly explain is that you have to go to the Lower Level to collect your beach towels, they aren't waiting for you in your room. When I went to get my welcome package for the wrist bands I was very upfront that I had no interest in the timeshare and the man was very understanding and didn't pressure me at all. I was extremely impressed that when my daughter left her tokens for the arcade on a table by the hotel bar that the bartender took it upon himself to go replace them when we came back and couldn't find them. My daughter is six so it literally meant so much to her. The one and only complaint I have is about one of their managers. I had to go to the lower level to print our boarding passes. They were out of toner so when he came to replace it he griped about how people wasted his paper and toner by pushing print too many times and printing out stupid stuff. Obviously, I didn't do it so had no worries. But then he proceeded to stand over me while i printed them. I had about 12 pieces of paper because I was printing two tickets per adult (6 with us) because of a layover. He sarcasitcally asked me \"wow, they have you changing flights that many times??\" So when I explained how many peoples tickets i was printing he walked away. Its sad that he is the manager and will so poorly run the employees into the ground if thats how he treats guests. Im assuming he has short man sydrome....... Cocoa beach was great to visit if you want a day trip. And Disney world took us about 1 hour to get to or 1 1/2 if rush hour.

Even the Hilton next door could not stand a chance. The oversize balcony which had its own entrance from the master was phenomenal. If there was one complaint, it would be I did not stay longer. Joe even let me check in early! I give this resort hands down 5 stars. I did not eat on location but right on the boardwalk, which is conveniently attached to the resort was sloppy joes, and boy do they make the best Cuban sandwich I have ever tasted.

The pools are great, especially if traveling with children. Great splash zone for the little ones. Lazy river is also a plus. For Daytona, you probably will not find a better selection of pools/water options. Cons-The rooms are dated and need remodeling. If you are a room person, this may not be the place. Also, we went with our family and a set of grandparents. We reserved a one bd rm king and the GPs also reserved a separate one bedrm king. We checked in at different times and both of us were given a one bedrm w two queens. We both had a little bit of a hassle actually getting the rooms w kings. Other guests said that, regardless of what you reserve, you don't get a king one bedrm unless you insist on it at check-in. Also- in our one bedrm, we had 4 towels for 4 people and one travel bar of soap for a 6 day stay. Yes, they have washer/driver, but when 4 people are at the beach all day and no one stays in and does laundry, you need at least 6 towels. Also, one travel soap is not sufficient. I asked for extra towels and one extra bar of soap and the front management said no. I had to make a special request to a supervisor- something about my condo was owned by another company or individually owned and they would not provide additional towels or an extra bar of soap. Really? This soap request had to be elevated to the next level- not kidding. Take home message: nice pools, but do not expect the full Wyndham experience as far as rooms or service.

We hung out in the lobby which is the only place to get free wi-fi. The convenient store in the lobby was a bit pricey but very convenient (no pun intended). They offer coffee, breakfast (the breakfast burrito was DELICIOUS), lunch and dinner. They also sell toiletries, toys, liquor etc. (overpriced but I don't think I expected it not to be). Our room was beautiful. I believe we were in 1412A. We live in a studio in NYC so our 1 bedroom which included a full kitchen and jacuzzi (!) was very comfortable and spacious. The view was great. I was so excited when we saw dolphins one morning! Breathtaking! Unfortunately I had gotten sick during the week so I spent a lot of time in the room so it was a good thing it was so spacious. The room also included a washer and dryer but we didn't use them. We don't drive so being close to restaurants and bars were really important to us. Ocean Walk Shoppes (center) was actually attached to the hotel. Our first dinner and drinks were at Sloppy Joe's. It was nice - we took home a huge coconut souvenir cup. There's a movie theater, Quiznos, Ker's Winghouse, Starbucks, Cold Stone Creamery, Bubba Gump Shrimp. Mai Tai Bar had great drinks. Ihop, Burger King, Dunkin Donuts, Dominoes and Walgreens are all in walking distance. We shopped at Walgreens to stock the kitchen with some snacks but mostly we ate out. Expect lots of pizza flyers under your door from the pizzeria across the street - we ate their pizza and wings a few times. Pretty tasty. As I said, I was sick so I didn't get to explore the hotel as much as I would've liked. But there were a few things that I did notice when I forced myself out of the room. The pool bar closes at 7pm which I feel is ridiculous. Mostly, because the lobby bar RARELY has a bartender available. I would def recommend the bucket of voodoo juice from the pool bar ($12 which includes the take-home bucket). I heard the food was great at the pool bar as well, but I didn't get a chance to try any. The pools looked really comfortable. I only got into the lazy river which was pretty relaxing. The only thing that I have to say raised an eyebrow for us was security. The Ocean Walk hotel leads to the Ocean Walk Shoppes. There's a door on the 4th fl that will lead you to the shoppes. It doesn't require a key card to get back into that door which makes you think that public could be using that door to get into the hotel to use the pools. Although they gave us a wrist band to wear that supposedly was \"mandatory\" I didn't see everyone in the pool with one and neither did I see security questioning those people as to where their bands were. I must say I am a timeshare owner so I booked this room through my time share (El Cid) which also books vacations through RCI which is what I used the points for. I don't know if that's why our room was so nice. We were asked to sit through a time share meeting which would've included a $100 gift card and free breakfast or lunch but we declined. They called once during the week and left I think 3 cards to remind us to come down for the meeting but we never responded so they didn't harass us. I would DEF go back to this hotel.", "Date": "September 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cBad service, go somewhere else!!!\u201d", "Author": "Adaisa", "ReviewID": "UR118262931", "Content": "The line at check in was extremely long and it took over 20min to get help from an agent.

I pulled off the comforter from the bed because I don't care where you are at , I swear they NEVER wash them. Well underneath was the other blanket that was brown. Well glad I pulled that one off because I could see where something dried on it. It could have been bodily fluids for all I know....GROSS!!! Luckily I brought my own blanket to put on top of the sheets. The kitchen had everything you would need except the ice maker did not work!!!! That was a major downer. You should wear a pool band while in the pool areas, however I never wore mine & I was never questioned about it. The security does stand around the pool areas. The indoor pool in my opinion was not comfortable. It should have been warmer. We arrived on a Tuesday night and it was so peaceful. The elevators were quick. There were plenty of parking and no lines anywhere. We could find a beach chair at 11:00 in the AM. I say that to say this....by Friday when everyone showed up things we complete madness. You will enjoy this hotel if you can go during the week in the off season and not in June/July. We left a day early because the amount of people was crazy. We went out one morning and had to go to the beach because they had no pool chairs. The elevators were very slow with all the people coming and going. One of the problems came when I got on the elevator only to discover that a boy and his 2 freinds had pushed like 5 other floors randomly thinking it was funny.

The second time I called from the floor and they sent up a security officer to let me in. He was very polite and helpful.

Their main purpose, it turned out, was to encourage us to attend a breakfast scheduled for Monday morning. When I inquired if this was to solicit us for a time share, the lady was very evasive, and assured us there would be no \"pressure\". We then proceded to our room, and our immediate reaction was disappointment. There was no ocean view (we had reserved a one bedroom), the pictures on the website were in no way representative of what we got. When I went into the bedroom, the venetian blinds were broken (at the top and bottom) where anyone walking past could see into the room. I called the operator (dialing zero) and the person was not helpful, and was in fact rude. She ask if I wanted to speak to the supervisor and I told her that in fact I did. The supervisor's reccomendation was that I hang a blanket over the window. When I informed her that I did not \"hang blankets over windows at home\" and I had no intention of doing so here. I told her I did not pay over $1000 dollars to hang blankets over the window. She ask if I wanted to change rooms, I informed her yes I did. She stated there would be a \"room cleaning\" charge (remember I hadn't been here ten minutes yet). I questioned this, and she stated it was \"policy\". Then she switched and told me they were full up and there were no rooms available. The maintenance person, to his credit, found??? a new blind about two hours later and installed it. In addition we discovered; the can opener did not work, the phone in the bedroom did not work, the remote control to the living room TV did not work. I called again and was informed they would be fixed, they never were. I called back later, and they informed all had been repaired (they weren't) we had never even left the room. Finally, we retired for the evening resolved to make the best of it. The light that came into the room the whole night was like daylight there were no curtains only the blinds and the light from the bright lights in the hall could not be stopped (I guess we could have hung a blanket over the window). In the morning we were both very sore as the mattress was as hard as a rock (I now suspect we were indeed sleeping on the boxspring without a real mattress). I say this because on the day we checked out I discovered the edges were made of metal, I never removed the sheets to check, it was later that I wondered if it was indeed the boxspring. My wife had to sleep on the couch in the living room the last four nights as her pain just kept getting worse.

We had 9 adults sharing the suite, which fit us for the most part. I booked this for my Bachelor party so that we could all have one place to hang out, be on the beach, and be walking distance to bars and restaurants. For this purpose, Ocean Walk served us well. Other than that, we all didn't have many good things to say about the place. For one, check-in was a nightmare. I stood in line for 30 minutes, while questioning whether I was even in the right line. There are no signs anywhere telling you which desk and line to be in. The desk staff were incredibly slow at handling each customer, and it seemed there was still a ton of paperwork to fill out despite having made an online reservation. Once I signed papers and got all checked in, I could not receive my room keys because the room wasn't ready at 4:15pm. 45min later... room was still not ready; this was the case for almost everyone too - no one got in their room at check-in time. So we walked to a bar, had some drinks and food, and came back around 6:30pm to a room that was finally ready for us. This resort is incredibly mobbed with people everywhere. This is a family place and we understood that going into it, so we really didn't pay much attention to the gobs of families clogging every crevice of the hotel until it came to the elevators. We had a rude hotel staffer tell us that there is a family that has been waiting for an elevator for 20min on the bottom floor (we were on the main floor, which is one above the bottom floor) and that we can't get on the elevator that opened for us, even though we had been waiting for about 10 - 15min ourselves. We were on the 10th floor, so even for young guys stairs weren't an option (this place has 23 floors or so). We didn't use the pool area, so we can't comment. It was of course packed. We didn't use any of the other features, restaurants, or entertainment areas. The suite itself was pretty nice and had a wonderful view of the beach. We enjoyed having a full kitchen and fridge. Sleeping arrangements were fairly convenient, although you won't find 9 guys complaining much when they just want a place to crash after a night out. So we enjoyed the suite. Check out is 10am. Well, after a night out, getting everything out of there was tough. So I walked down with a friend to ask if we could get it extended. We asked politely, and instead of either a yes or a polite \"so sorry we can't help you\", we got a stern and slightly rude reply that it'd be $100 for every hour over 10am. To that, we mentioned that our room wasn't ready for almost an hour for check-in, and she abruptly told us that a check-in time isn't guaranteed. Good to know... She then told us they had already given out the \"maximum check-out extensions\". Apparently you need to put in that request early, which was something else we weren't aware of. So we had to drag everything out of the room and have someone watch over it in the hallway while we made trips to the cars. Overall, although our weekend was a blast, it was a mixed bag of pluses and minuses with Ocean Walk. The location is ideal and the suite was great. Those two are its saving graces.

We rented from an owner (americasbestvacationrentals.com) and got an amazing deal. This is the guy to rent from. When we arrived at around 10:00 (checkout time for those leaving) we were the first people there and we were greeted by the nicest lady ever named courtney collins. She pulled a few strings and got us into an oceanfront on the 16th floor and it was phenomenal. My family had lots of fun going to the well maintained beach, the boardwalk, the shops right next door and across the street, and most of all, the lazy river. Now one downside would be that it is almost impossible to find a beach chair and you may have to wait a minute or two for a float at the lazy river sometimes so if you have a chair or a float of your own bring them to save time. The pools are as clean as they can be at a resort which is right on the beach and the staff do what they can to keep it clean. We had an incident while we were there when a small child defecated in the kiddie pool. The mother informed the front desk and within minutes the pool was shut down and cleaned. The resort was very clean and the staff was very friendly. Everything was in working order and the amenities were plentiful. There was an internet cafe for when there was work to be done and an adult office armed with a printer and a fax machine. There is an arcade and a 24/7 play room with many toys and a wii for the kids to play with, which was a blessing for our family with 5 kids. There was a pretty up to date gym and a total of 4 pools plus the lazy river (2 indoor and 2 outdoor, on of the indoor ones had a projector and a screen which showed movies every night). Our room was immaculately clean when we arrived and though we did have a problem with a faucet it was fixed within 15 minutes by a very well informed staff member. The staff was very quick to come with extra soap and detergent and even an extra pot. But beware, this is a resort, not a hotel, there is no maid to come in and clean every day. there were 2 HD tvs which kept us entertained and no one was bored for a minute.

Yes, the hotel has some problems to work through, but this isn't a 5 star resort. For the price you pay, it's not bad at all. I've stayed at 5 star and it was worse. The check is takes about 30-45min and does not start until 4pm. You do have the option to pre reg in the morning and using the pool as you wait. At 4pm, there is a seperate line for you and you do not have to wait in the other line. I rented through a owner who is Great. He mentioned that with the 3bedroom (lockout) only comes with 1 parking pass. But did offer an additonal pass for $25. I took it as it was cheaper than parking across the street. We left and came back ater 10pm and never had an issue with finding a spot. We ended up on the top, but not a problem. The elevators are busy in the afternoon on the weekends, when everyone is trying to check in. But after that, not a big deal. The hotel is big and you can't expect the elevator to open the moment you push the button. The pool issue is true. But when we wanted chairs at the pool, we got up early. They do remove your towels after 1 1/2. I saw many chairs that were reserved, but within that 1 1/2 the people came back. You can't expect the hotel to have chairs for every person. The hotel is located on one of the world famous beaches, which means most people would be going to the beach. Yes, our room was run down some, but thats called wear and tear. Over time, things get beat up by people who do not take care of other peoples things. Everyone who is complaining about not getting ocean front or there wasn't enough seating.....rent through a owner next time. You can see pictures and choose the room you want.

Free parking in a hotel operated parking garage is an excellent amenity at the beach. Cons The staff seemed overwhelmed by the number of people at the hotel.

The lady who we spoke to wanted to know why we were calling for him. We explained the check-in situation and told her we had been sitting in the lobby since 200pm. She rudely told us that check-in was not until 400pm anyway and hung up. About 420pm we stood in line for another 15 minutes and were then given the keys to our room. The room was clean but one of the door knobs to the bedroom was broken. The location was very crowded and sometimes there was 5 to 10 minute wait for elevators. At the pool side it was difficult to get chairs or tables. As always people put their towels on the chairs early in the morning and sometimes didnt even use them.

This was never explained to us when we checked in. We were not about to stand in line at the front desk again so we went to our room and made our own drinks.

Then presented with a deal to buy into a time share for around $30,000.00 when we turned that one down the dog and pony show started. As typical the first person trying to sell us acted like he really didnt understand everything so the MANAGER had to step in and help. We were then hit with 4 more deals that finally went from $30,000.00 to $9,000.00. When those were refused a third person was brought in. He act more sternly with us than the first two.

In order to be fair and clear I will begin at the beginning...We rented for an individual owner who was very nice to deal with...the room we rented was a King Bedroom with a lock-out ... the layout was wonderful and there was an abundance of space for the 5 of us! We arrived approx 6pm on the day of check-in...The line was jaw-dropping, at least a 45 minute wait to speak with one of the three desk clerks. As we had rented all of our units from the same owner, we had pre-paid our rental fee, cleaning fee, & security deposit and signed a complete short term rental agreement. When we reached the counter, the clerk asked for another $150.00 cc hold/deposit...now we are talking $450.00 in deposit...when I asked about the deposit I was told... the larger deposit is for the property owner and the $150.00 for resort incidentals. Should have been a red flag but I didn't catch it...I was also presented with a resort contract, requiring my signature. The problem with this was the contradictions with the original rental contract. Check-out time, which is enforced with a financial penalty was different, the parking (which I will address later) was different...and when I asked for a copy of this document that was not their policy. All checked in and ready to proceed to our room, we learned there is only one bellhop on-duty and only 4 luggage carts...it was suggested by the desk clerk that we \"just wait until around 10pm and then try to get a cart\". The 5 of us proceeded to our 10th floor unit while the 4 others made their way to the 9th floor. On our route we found an unattended luggage cart sitting in the elevator hallway. Of course we grabbed it, telephoned the other members of our group and made tracks to the parking garage to retrieve our luggage, deposited it the rooms and returned the cart to the main lobby. Our unit (with lock-out) included two full baths...after 11 hours in our vehicle, we all wanted hot showers and dinner. Surprise! No hot water in the South Tower, response from front desk \"They are working on it - Should be several more hours\". When we returned from Dinner, around 10pm, we had warm water and virtually no pressure, which continued for throughout the trip. Rinsing my hair was a lesson in determination, it took forever, the pressure would barely rinse the soap from your body. The outdoor pool areas were like nothing I have ever seen or experienced...The South Tower pool, hot tub and lazy river were dirty with a scuzzy film floating in the water and in great disrepair. The North Tower pool was much cleaner. I did not utilize the Kid's Water Play area, so I can't comment on the condition. The Turtle's Nest Tiki Bar opened around 11am and closed between 2:30 and 4:00pm...I would think the hours would line up, more closely, with the pool hours, which were posted as 8:15 to midnight. On our first morning, our group was perplexed by the line of people we observed forming on the sidewalk, beginning at around 7am. Imagine our surprise as we watched the uniformed security guards (south tower) and resort-attired personnel (north tower) begin to appear. At 8am...the guards/personnel stepped up, announced his wish that everyone should \"Have A Great Day\" to which those gathered on the sidewalk and steps responded by jumping barrier chains and bolting to chairs and tables. Often arguments and disagreements followed, which the personnel of either were unwilling to mediate. So, if you want a chair or table on the pool deck, plan to show up around 7am, get yourself in line and then behave like an NFL front lineman to claim a spot. This happens every morning, without fail. We fondly referred to this process as \"The running of the Bulls\". If you don't mind afternoon pool activity in the shade, you can show up around 2:30pm, as those wishing to enjoy the sun begin to vacate the area due to the buildings shading the entire area from 2:30pm until dark. Over the course of our seven day stay we began to hear other guests grumbling and complaining about various issues. We were also able to gather a great deal of info about the issues. The front desk personnel were routinely hateful and prone to a \"pass the buck\" attitude. It was here that one explained to me that the South Tower Homeowners Association and the Wyndham Resort are engaged in a law suit, therefore the staff is there to service the North Tower and is unavailable for the South Tower Guests, with the exception of things which they choose to do (check-in). Which explains why the personnel is unable to cross the invisible line on the sidewalk, answer questions, provide assistance, or even conduct themselves in a professional manner. It was a nightmare...they even have segregated lost and found areas. (ie...if you are staying in So. Tower, lose an item, an No. Tower Guest finds said item, turns it in to the front desk, you must contact So. Tower Security, have their personnel agree to contact No. Tower Security to inquire and retrieve item (if found) and then hope that So. Tower Security (third party firm) returns item to you, the rightful owner. Parking...The property owner who I rented from was clear and adamant that parking would be provided for only one vehicle per unit...I understand, it is peak season and parking is at a premium. Imagine my surprise when we returned to the property on Wednesday evening (approx 10pm) following dinner and were greeted by \"Garage Full\" Signs. The attendant said we should obtain an additional pass from the front desk. Clerk informed me that the on-site garages were full, gave me a 12 hour voucher for the public garage across the street, stating they can only park 90% of occupants and if I wish to park on-site I need to have my vehicle in the garage by 7pm. Along with a stern lecture that the car should be moved in a timely manner as they would not be responsible for additional fees, outside the 12 hours. The homeowner, from whom we rented, was very clear...One Pass for On-Site Parking...When we retrieved our vehicle at 8:30am, the following morning, there was a nasty note on the windshield about overnight parking and a chalk time written in the corner of the front windshield. It is our family tradition to rent scooters for one 24 hour period while vacationing in Daytona Beach. This has never been a problem, the other resorts allow you to park these very small vehicles in an out of the way corner of the garage without issue or conflict...NOT SO AT OCEAN WALK! We even offered to park them in the same spot with our vehicle...which was more than possible given the vehicle size...The response was if you do that we will tow one or both vehicles. We returned the rented vehicle and thanks to Julie we were able to amend our rental agreement and avoid a total loss of prepaid fees. Thanks Julie! So are ya keeping up so far,..In-line for pool chair no later than 7am...Vehicle in the garage by 7pm...No parking of Fun Rentals. The bottom line is this...This facility could be top-notch but they are far from that...Divisiveness among the \"Powers-That-Be\" have created an unfriendly, almost hostile atmosphere ... What a shame! We are only a group of 9, but we won't be back...when I am on vacation the last thing I want is to be drawn into and effected by someone else's drama and conflict...No Thanks...I will return to a resort where it's all R & R!", "Date": "July 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Milan, Indiana", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, bad customer service.\u201d", "Author": "lovetheworld1", "ReviewID": "UR115527884", "Content": "This hotel is a great location, but the customer service is lacking.

It is a great place for kids. Nice pools, lazy river, right on beach, Ocean walk shoppes and boardwalk are right there. I have been to Daytona Beach before but stayed in the smaller mom and pop type hotels never experiencing this type of enviroment which was a little overwhelming for me. Now that I know I have to prepare myself mentally for a Disneyworld type of vacation I will go back prepared. Kis loved it. Pros: Very friendly and helpful staff, Condo was very clean and great size for a family, Pools, waterslide, lazy river, activities, Ocean Walk shoppes and restaurants, Walk to boardwalk, right on beach, great place for kids, Lots of security, no cars parked on that section of beach, lifeguards. Cons: Very crowded, long lines, not enough parking, hot water runs out midday for showers. Arrived at 4:30 after check-in, moving car, waiting for bellman (not enough carts available) another line for pool wristbands which you have to do and try to get convinced to listen to timeshare offer did not get settled in our room until 7:30. Not enough pool chairs. Tips to make vacation more enjoyable: Bring your reservation # and/or creditcard statement showing charge for checkin Stay more than 2 nights, you lose the first day due to the slowness at checkin Prepare yourself mentally for a very big crowd and long waits like if going to Disney If driving, dont plan to check in until after 7pm no lines Go to pool before 8am to put your towels on chairs to save your seats Go to beach by 8:30am to reserve your beach chairs and umbrellas Have your reservation number available when you drive up so you are directed to right parking garage. Enjoy cold showers If you have to leave your parking spot don't do it between 3 and 7 thats when new checkins start arriving and you lose your parking and have to go to public lot. If eating at any of the restaruants in Ocean Walk make reservations!!!! Very long waits.

The Good- The hotel has nice finishes and the room we stayed in was clean, well designed and fairly up to date. I liked that it had a small kithcen as opposed to just being a hotle room. The pool is beautiful and there are lots of amenities such as beach towel service, kids activities, two indoor pools, a nice gym, snack bar at the pool, etc. Daytona also puts on a great fireworks display every friday night that you can see from your balcony. The BAD- Its a timeshare and they will pressure you to buy a timeshare. They will run your check in credit card info to access your credit report and then offer you financing for the timeshare. Thinking of buiying a time share? Ask a realtor if thery really are a \"great investment\". I am very much opposed to buying them, but I love to rent from teh people that do own them. But back to the review.... Also, be preparred for a horrible check-in experience. Lines and waiting. Other Guests- There were a lot of other guests. The pool and lazy river were so crowded that it made me not want to get in. This was likely due to us going at the most busy time of year- Im sure its probably not as crowded in the fall/winter. There were way more smokers than I am used to. I have a new baby, so I was not happy to be surrounded by smokers in the pool area. Daytona seems to be trying to move past thier \"bike week\" reputaiton and attract more families throught the year. The guests at the hotel were representative of this transition. It was not uncommon to see guests in the elevators with open containers in the evening, but no one seemed to be overindulging or acting in an offensive manner. TIPS= -If you book via a \"third party\" like orbitz or kayak or hotels.com be sure to confirm your reservation. There was a \"glitch\" in our reservation and if I had not called to confirm we would have gotten there and not had a room -They say check-in is at 4, but the earlier you arrive the better and more likely you are to recieve the oceanfront you booked. You can \"pre-check in\" any time and then show you your ID in ANOTHER line after 4 to get your room key. I suggest waiting until 5 to get the key so the line dies down. -When returning from the pool/beach, go down to the lower level and get on the elevators at the LL level. You will skip the wait on the main lobby level and not have to parade the lobby in your swim suit. Expect long waits at the elevator at check in. - Get a great rate by booking your room through someone who owns a timeshare there. there are a bunch of timeshare rental sites where owners post. When we stayed they were asking $900 for a 2 bedroom for a week as a last minute deal.

Then we were suppose to check in as VIP's and their VIP counter was not staffed (we learned later from several staff members that they were understaffed). We went to our room and everything at that point looked great. After a day on the beach and receiving wrong directions from a guest service representative to the local Walmart, we decided to seek out their out door bar by the pools and ocean. It was closed at 3pm due to understaffing (a staff member pointed this out). Then we decided to walk on the beach and go to dinner. When returning to the hotel room at 9:30ish we turned back the covers to find clear sticky stuff all over the sheets. I called housekeeping for a new set. It took over an hour and a half for them to arrive. My husband then decided to take a shower and the shower head was sitting on the soap dish in the shower stall and would not attach. A call to maintenance. Another hour + wait. My husband called to speak to a manger and the clerk said she would call right back. NOTHING. The next morning we went to seek out a manager. On the way we noticed a foul smell coming from the vending room. We think it was the sewer. The manager talked to us and did admit staff problems and wants to send us a two night stay on them for our problems. We will not be going back...why? Let me tell you....He had us go to a new room the next day. It was ocean view so we were happy until we saw the comforter which had a brown crusty matter on it....eeeewwww! Housekeeping brought us a blanket instead and took the comforter. Then at night I got up to go to the bathroom and found roaches everywhere. I also checked the kitchen...roaches. We researched them when we got home and they look like German Roaches. I frantically called a manager in the morning.

The area is great, lots of restaurants, shopping, beautiful beach and friendly staff there (not part of the resort). Some staffmembers were wonderful (maintenance and security). Some issues we reported, some we did not, based on how busy and out of control the resort appeared in trying to deal with number of guests.

The ammeneties are great. Nice pool area. Lazy river and waterslide a bonus for those of us with kids. Great location on a \"no drive\" part of the beach. Ocean Walk shops/restaurants are very conveniently located next door so you can just throw on your flip flops and cover up and head to happy hour. Mai Tai bar has $5 appetizers during happy hour - all of them delicious, and some great drink specials. Very close to boardwalk which was a favorite hangout at night for the teenagers in our group. Rooms are nice enough - typical luxury condo - nicely furnished. Now, the BAD. Parking is a problem, especially if you go out during the day and are late returning. It is possible you will not find a spot in either of the parking garages. This happened to us twice during the week and we had to pay to park in the public garage across the street. Very inconvenient - especially if you have a load to carry. Elevators are slow and we wasted lots of time waiting for and riding in elevators. My husband caught a couple of teenagers redhanded who had just landed on the bottom floor and pushed ALL the buttons and sent all elevators back up to the 25th floor. I guess not much can be done about that - but it was a problem. Weekends were especially busy and sometimes it would take 20-30 minutes to get from our room (on the 25th floor) to the lobby. Luggage carts were not available at either our check in or our check out. So we had to make several trips to get all of our luggage & belongings to our room. That took 2-3 hours of our vacation time away from us. Of course everything is overpriced in the eatery and the bar -- but that is to be expected. We ate and drank elsewhere. The \"bait and switch\" scam regarding room allocation has been mentioned on this site before and I truly believe it is common practise at this location. We booked 8 months in advance and were promised an \"ocean front\" room. That is what we paid for, that is what we expected. This is very much a priority for me when choosing a place to stay. We were given a room in the North Tower on the 25th floor with a \"city view\". The staff talked in circles when we questioned this and basicly stuck with the rebuttle that we should never have been \"promised\" an ocean front room. \"Room assignments are made upon check in\" Same thing happened to the couple traveling with us. Promised ocean front and got city view. Very disappointing. What I learned after is that you have to be a timeshare owner with a gazillion points to secure an ocean front or even ocean view room. So - even though the amenities were great, and the place was nice - we would probably not go back here because of all the BAD things mentioned above. Plus, we saw lots of places during our stay there in the same area that were also very nice and had great amenties as well -- and for much less money. I still give it an overall \"very good\" rating, mostly because of it's location.

Admittedly, the first impression this time was not a particularly good one; the check-in lines were abnormally long-- even the VIP Express lane. To our disappointment, we were given only one parking pass; the other car in our party had to pay for overnight parking in a garage across the street, and the customer service associate didn't seem particularly helpful or sympathetic about the situation. The service manager did rectify the problem the next day, however. The hotel's location is right in the thick of things; it's right next door to the Ocean Walk Shoppes (with several \"upscale casual\" restaurants like Bubba Gump Shrimp Co.), and a short walk from the Boardwalk and the Pier. There is a Burger King, two pizza places, a Dunkin Donuts and Starbucks within a three-minute-walking radius. The only negative I can think of about the location is that the only way to exit the parking area is a right turn onto Atlantic Avenue (divided highway), so travelers must go down a couple of stoplights before making a U-turn, which is thankfully legal in Florida. Our room was a 3-bedroom suite, the largest type available at this facility. Except for the rather well-used couch, the interior was in good repair, and the bathrooms showed no sign of mold or mildew. The full kitchen is well-stocked with cookware; I recommend using it for breakfast and the occasional lunch, in order to save money versus the rather high prices in the on-site deli. A definite improvement from 2009 is the availability of free WiFi in the rooms. Don't get too excited; signal coverage is sometimes spotty and can vary from point to point inside the units, and speed is not particularly fast-- good enough for a Facebook status update or e-mail check, but video streaming is not feasible for extended viewing. Those of you who are worried about the pool's current state of repair because of recent reviews, worry no more. All pool facilities are now fully operational. I've included a photo of the \"lazy river\" and pool with waterslide; both were running just fine the entire time. There is a second full-size pool and gated kiddie splash area, which helped ensure that no pool was ever too crowded, even though this was during peak season. The pool deck could have used a couple dozen more chairs though; they were indeed in short supply. I marked the Sleep Quality down as \"average\". The beds are comfortable enough, but the fact that this is a high-rise facility virtually guarantees that another guest is above you, and is likely to have a different sleep pattern and/or occasionally rowdy children or teenagers.

I was really skeptical having read all of the reviews, but to my surprise it was one of the most relaxing vacations that we have taken. The check in was smooth, but that may have been due to the fact that we checked in on a Sunday. We were on the 9th floor in the North tower and the unit was beautiful with a breathtaking view! Most things are actually in the South tower, but easy to access. The elevators were very slow though, so you will have to be a little patient. My husband and I actually took the stairs a couple of times because we didn't want to wait, but they are not well labeled, so you may have to hunt. The parking garage was packed with vehicles, but we expected that. Each level of the garage is accessible to the elevators by going through a side door. Our unit was top notch. Our gift was given to us by people who own a timeshare through the Wyndham, so I wonder if that made a bit of a difference with the shape of the unit. The only complaint with the room that I had was a little mold around the shower head in the main room. Otherwise it was excellent from the view to the bed and its comfort! The bar is only open a little after 11pm, but the bartender in the evening was fabulous! The drinks were great and he sparked conversation with ease. I think his name was Micheal. The Turtle's Nest out by the pool is great too! They do start serving food at 11am, but stop around 4pm, yet drinks were available until around 6pm. The shops next door were handy and nice to access. We enojoyed walking down the boardwalk and taking it all in!! The Mai Tai Bar is next door and I believe they have happy after 7pm!!! We didn't go, but I am sure it is a deal. That is now my favorite drink!! So, please DO NOT go to Napoli pizza acrossed the street! They have horrible customer service and I think the sauce is actually tomato paste!! Restaurants in the area that I have to recommend are: Crabby Joe's-- Sunglow Pier! We ate there twice!! Excellent view and food! Oyster Pub-for yummy oysters and a sportslike atmosphere..be aware the drinks are Not strong...beer a better choice! Tailgators- Up A1A a bit from the Wyndham, Karoke Sunday nights and great food! You will be amazed at the Gator Bites appetizer. Ocean Deck- A short walk a way from the hotel and very popular! Great drinks and Great food!! Old City Pizza-Great oven brick pizza and they deliver to the lobby of the hotel!! Barnacles-Grouper like you have never had it! Ker's Wing House- Great salad and wings!

Sloppy Joe's- Also great for lunch The beach is 26 miles long and nobody can own a part of Daytona Beach!! This makes it quite accessible and really enjoyable if you want to go to a section where there isn't a lot of people! We drove almost to Ponce Inlet to find a nice area of the beach where we felt spaced out and could enjoy taking a nap and relaxing.

I would recommend this resort for moms and families that like to cook and clean after themselves. There is no maid but we didn't care about that. we cooked our own food to save money but we also went out to Bubba Gump=amazing food and IHOP down the street amazing food as well. We went to shop at Publix and we got alot of food and alot fo liquor for $215 for the whole week. The check in was great as we were part of vip program, the service was amazing through the whole stay and everything was working. The lazy river was not green or smelly everything was clean and amazing. This beach was the best beach in the whole world better than MEXICO, CUBA, ST LUCIA or DOMENICAN REPUBLIC.

The condo itself had a rotting cabinet in the kitchen that was pulling away from the wall. There was black mold around the tub, we had no washcloths for the week and only 4 towels and 2 handtowels. If you want a beach towel you have to check them out (you would think they would have a bin of towels near the pool) and you'll be charged 25.00 if you don't bring it back. You only get one to last all week. The screen door was broken, we asked them to please fix it to keep bugs out, they said they would send someone up, they never did. The pull out couch mattress was so rough with springs sticking up and flat as a board, you could not even sleep on it! Our guests had to sleep on the floor! We had to check out a day early for an emergency. We forgot our phone charger and some clothes. I called the hotel within a hours of us leaving, they put me through to the security office and when I asked them to check our room and mail the items to us, they told me that they may not be able to check and if they did they would call me back. They never called and obviously we will never see our things again. They couldn't even bother to mail our items even though we had just spent 1200.00! We also did Not get a refund for the last day that we had to leave. So basically they are thieves. Maids included. The things were in plain sight that we left, so I know the housekeeping had to have found them. Over all, no one at any time while were there were of any assistance and when we were leaving and my husband went to the front desk to ask for a cart to bring our things down, he was told that \"they were all being used.\" That was it. So if you are expecting nice friendly helpful service and nice ammenities for the high amount you spend on the rooms, then Ocean Walk Resort in Daytona is NOT the place to stay.

We just returned from a week stay at Ocean Walk and these people on here had me very worried w/ all of the negative comments and complaints. We had thought about changing to Bonnett Creek in Orlando as we had been there recently but decided to give Daytona a try. It had been 8yrs since we had last stayed at Ocean Walk as we seem to have the hardest time getting reservations there. We reserved our condo in January and were quite excited until I came on tripadvisor and became worried by what I was reading. First and foremost you with the negative comments need to get a clue! This resort is showing its age a bit but there is a reason, they see so many guests coming and going and using this place of course its going to show some wear and tear. There was not a day that went by that I did not see people working, cleaning, painting all day and into the night. A lot of people complained about the lazy river being down, you can thank the last years Spring Breakers! We talked to management and they said last years Spring Break was horrible on them. They have been struggling to clean and fix all the things they had broken and torn up. This year they were more strict, they had security guards everywhere! They did fix the lazy river while we were there but they had security constantly watching as the pumps were what they tore up and they were so expensive to replace. As far as the rooms, we were in the North Tower and our room was immaculate! One thing I do notice about this resort compared to other Wyndham properties is that there are a lot of owned units here, not managed by Wyndham. If you rent from an owner and not Wyndham you are going to have problems, and you can not blame Wyndham for the condition of the units you need to talk to the owner you rented from. Lastly I saw a lot of complaints here about service. We had an issue right at getting into our room and a toilet not flushing, they were there w/in 10min - left to get parts and were right back and had it fixed. The Guest Services were always kind and helpful and glad to help w/ anything. Please rest assured this is still a great resort and I would not hesitate to stay here again.

At the front desk we were told it was an inside room. I asked the person if he could give me a price on an oceanfront room. After another 10 minutes he handed me my key. I was just grateful to get it. The crowd behind me was growing. I went to the room and it was a crypt. One window looking in to outside hall. It was dank and dreary with no natural light.

There is plenty to do in the area and the location is great. There are some improvements to be made on the property and if you are a Wyndham owner, be prepared for the early morning call asking you to talk with some Wyndham reps about your \"check in\".. First of all, the resort location is fantastic. You are very close to several pizza joints and local restaraunts. There are a couple bars near by as well as beach gift shops. We didn't make it to the Ocean Walk shoppes but they were busy each time we drove by. The local pizza joints do deliever but you have to pick your order up in the lobby which isn't a problem. Parking wasn't a problem for us until the last night of our stay when we had to park in the south tower versus the north as there wasn't room. The resort is right on the beach and within steps of the outdoor pools. We didn't make it to the \"boarwalk\" but there are rides if you are looking for something to do in the evening. Now to the unplesantries. First of all, we are Wyndahm owners and expected that we wouldn't have housekeeping the week we were there. We got checked in late and were woken on our first morning by a chipper girl named Michelle saying that they wanted to come to our room to do a brief survey to see how check-in went and to bring a \"gift basket\" up. Knowing we would be asked to come to some presentation or other, I told her I wasn't interested but she insisted that it would \"really help us out\" and the questions couldn't be answered over the phone. She assured me the \"visit\" would only take 10 minutes. I called her back a couple hours later saying that we were on our way out if she wanted to send someone up before we left, we would see them. An hour and a half later, two Wyndham employees came up with a JOKE of a \"gift basket\". It had two bottles of water and four small bags of snack foods. I was very firm with them and told them I wasn't interested in going to any presentations, updates or anything else that would take time away from our family vacation. However, we agreed to answer their questions. They asked ONE question about check in and the rest of the 25 minutes was spent trying to convince us to come to a Member Welcome Lunch the following day and so forth. The gentleman also asked if we were aware that we could have had an ocean front room if we only had a few more points. Of course we knew this and pointed out that the room was all we needed for this trip. I had to tell the Wyndham folks several times that we weren't interested in ANYTHING and were just there to vacation, not to be bothered with meetings and the such. Needless to say, we didn't attend the lunch the following day. The resort staff members were very nice, but slow. We called the \"Fun Center\" to have a high chair brought to our room and were told that the woman working was the only one there and couldn't leave so she would have someone from the front desk bring the chair or we had to come get it ourselves. Well, no one ever brought one and we had to get it ourselves later in the evening. To boot, we had to personally return the chair the night before our departure, instead of housekeeping taking care of it for us. Another night, we requested a second blanket for our room and were told it would be bright right up. Well, 45 minutes later, I called again and they said \"it should be on it's way\". After another 45 minutes, I went to the desk personally and asked for the blanket and was told that housekeeping had to get it off the floor \"storeage\" and they had none at the desk. Finally, they called housekeeping and I was advised the blanket had just been delieverd, and it was. On the upside, we also requested extra lanundry detergent and it was brought up very quickly! The lazy river was not working and had been down for at least three weeks. This was the one thing my husband was looking forward to and one of the reasons he booked this resort. The water was green but no one worked on it the entire week we were there. Besides the green water, I'm not sure what needed work on the lazy river. Other reviewers have mentioned needing wrist bands to get into the pools. We were not given wrist bands at check in and none of the security guards questioned us, ever. Maybe this is something more geared to families with older children and college \"spring breakers\" who might be more prone to hotel pool hopping, I don't know. We brought our own beach towels from home so we had no need to use the hotel towels when going to the pool or beach. I have to say that the drink and food prices at the outdoor bar were reasonable and not overpriced as I expected. Beers started at $2 and food platters started at $3.50. We didn't go to the lobby bar or the \"convenient store\" inside the resort so I cannot comment on those prices. Overall, it was a nice stay for our family of three. We don't have enough points for an ocean front room but our one bedroom was just enough for us. There were college spring breakers but they weren't too much of a problem. At one point, there was a loud group of girls walking the hall and I politely stuck my head out asking them to quiet down as we had a baby who was trying to sleep. The girls were nice enough and apologized. I imagine that the ocean front room would have been quieter. On a side note (since I haven't seen it in any other posts), you can rent beach chairs and umbrellas on the beach from non-resort companies. We rented two chairs and an umbrella for $30 for the entire day (until 5PM, when the companies start packing up). The resort towers do begin to block the sun by about 2:30PM and it is difficult to find a place to sit if you get down to the pools in the afternoon. Our daughter really enjoyed the kiddie pool area and other kids played with her. It was a nice change from the louder big kids in the other pools!", "Date": "April 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hammond, Indiana", "Title": "\u201cVery surprised.....a little disappointed\u201d", "Author": "GeorgiaK47", "ReviewID": "UR102416265", "Content": "Was not sure what to expect, but was a disappointed with the check in process and the room itself.

The beach was beautiful but the religous man shouting through a megaphone standing on a bench 1 ft out the gate of the pool area made it unusable. The things he shouted were horrible and insulting. It was offensive that he was allowed to yell those things at anyones child. He would start at 10 am and shout until after 4pm and could be heard all the way on our 19th floor room. The lazy river was green/brown and not operable. The pool deck was packed from sun up to sun down and the water quality reflected the large swim load. The put-put wasn't free as stated in the directory. The nightly Karaoke was loud in the lobby which one evening included the full length version of Michael Jackson's triller.

In comparison to last year's good experience, this year's was 'not so great'. The only thing superb was the weather. The positives first. Yes, Ocean Walk is still the best value on Daytona Beach for families who want a large, oceanfront unit with all of the comforts of home including a full kitchen that is near everything. The Hilton stands just next door but there is no comparison. No balconies, kitchens or decent pool there. I gave Ocean Walk four stars last year because it is NOT a full service hotel like the Hilton, with a sit down restaurant, room service, valet etc...If you want THAT, go THERE.I enjoy the convenience of self-catering. No lines, tips, bad service or getting dressed to go out to eat. And then there is the huge tab.We have saved literally thousands over the years 'timesharing'. Disappointments at Ocean Walk this year: The lazy river, a point of relaxation and fun last year was closed and had algae growing on the walls. I never once saw anyone working on it to get it up and running while we were there. The entire property had been invaded by spring breakers. Every night we were there they invaded and took over the South hot tub and drank beer there until the early hours, in a very loud and often vulgar manner. I was awakened one night at 2 AM by drunken screaming from a balcony nearby. That South hot tub itself was very unclean, murky and had a greenish tint all of the time we were there. I watched the South deck cleaners open up the deck each morning before sunrise. The fellow with the powerwasher would focus on the area around the hot tub and the entrance to the water slide, then quit. I guess he then felt able to say Yes, I powerwashed the deck\" to his supervisor. Unmotivated, I suppose. Too bad his efforts did NOT show improvements. The entire deck needs to be powerwashed more often AND re-surfaced. The deck swarmed with spring breakers every day,and Ocean Walk catered to them by playing VERY LOUD music. The bar now advertises to the general public \"$3 draft beer\" on a large, permanent banner to the general public walking by on the boardwalk. At the Eastern boardwalk entrance, a room key is no longer required to enter the pool deck area. Thus, enter ALL of those who are not staying at Ocean Walk who want to use the deck and buy that cheap beer! Forget security. There is none at Ocean Walk any more. The room card security lock at the entrance from Ocean Walk shoppes complex has been disabled as well. I guess the security of Wyndham's guests is not too important anymore...at least not at Ocean walk. I felt safe last year letting our two tween kids roam the property when the security system was working and being enforced. I saw FEW people wearing their pool deck ID bracelets because that simply was not being firmly enforced. We wore ours for the first two days of our one week stay, then just took them off because.hey, when in Rome...The only difference was that we had the RIGHT to be in Rome while others obviously did NOT because of the lax security. This is probably the worst mistake Wyndham can make at this property because there are dozens of young people loitering around outside the resort on the streets at any given time. Obviously many of them are not there to go to church, as evidenced by their physical dress and appearances. In our unit: The balcony railing in our 2 BR unit was filthy. I wiped part of it with a white wash rag and it came away black. On the ledge outside the master BR window there was pigeon waste. The balcony itself needed a powerwashing too. The balcony furniture was grimy. In the unit itself, two stove burners had to be plugged back in before they could be used. The dryer squeaked loudly when it was used, there were cracked tiles in the unit, the dishwasher was loose, the master BR smelled slightly of vomit....Thank God the safe worked...I would have been somewhat afraid to leave my valuables out in the open with ZERO SECURITY... We won't be using our Wyndham points or spending our money at Ocean walk again unless there is a change of management to one whose financial hands have not been tied by 'corporate' and has a watchful eye for details. If there are no immediate changes Wyndham's Daytona Beach Ocean Walk, flagship of the Florida Southeast Atlantic seaboard should be re-named to 'Titanic' except no one is even polishing the brass anymore....Too bad. One more item.Each suite reservation gets only ONE parking space despite the size of your party,even if you are in a 3 bedroom which sleeps what,10 people? Great! All other members in the party who bring a car get to pay for parking in the public parking garage across the street.How unrealistic.Wyndham could not strike a deal with the garage to provide reduced rates or even free parking like OTHER nearby businesses do,in exchange for their guests' patronage?

I tried pulling up my email etc but no confirmation number etc. This room was going to go unsold and I had enough details to be believable but no confirmation. Any hotel I have ever stayed at would have done the right thing and given the room to me at the online rate but not her. I asked for the manager, which after 30 miniutes came to the lobby flanked by to security guards. WHAT? and the very loud drunk bikers continued to come and go unnoticed by her, the manager and security. No one had gotten loud, cussed or anything except complain normally. The manager stuck by full rack rate despite me looking up the rate on a ipad and showing her that now the rate had even gotten lower for the next 3 night I was staying.. She was as rude as they come and did not care. So I paid the extra 200 for the first night and booked the other night under a separate reservation with her watching. Here's where it even got worse, the next day, because the new reservation, they made me move to a different room(same type, same everything because I had a different reservation. I wonder if the owners of these condo's know how bad these people are? The hotel was very load, dirty and just have gotten worn out. I travel to Florida year round and often and I will avoid the Wyndham properties. Here's more. Yesterday I received the email with the original reservation for the lower rate and now I must check my credit card to see if I got charged.

I believe all of the rooms have washer/dryers, and they usually give you 2 packages of launtry detergent. This resort has time share owners, condo owners and Wyndham rents out these rooms per night, so there's bound to be confusion. The reviews about items stolen from rooms ... I have 1 theory of how this can happen. We have seen teens and young adults walking the halls, placing fliers from local businesses on the doors. Some of these doors do not lock when you walk out and don't pull it to. I have seen some of these people \"pushing\" on the doors to see if they are open. Please make sure you actually pull your door shut behind you, and it locks. They have free wireless internet in the lobby, but not the rooms. You check out pool towels. When you return the towels, ask for the copies they have and tear them up. When you get your pool bracelets and parking pass, they will usually tell you they want to do an \"update\" if you're an owner, if not an owner, they'll want to tell you all about what Wyndham has to offer.

Everything that we needed was there: beach chairs, umbrellas, bedding, fully equipped and working kitchens, washer/dryers, beach toys, more...The view from the balcony was very nice.

The bad: Like most people have said on here, the customer service is really awful. We didn't ask them for anything like towels or paper products, because we knew we had to launder everything ourselves and buy our own tp, stuff like that. My spouse did complain to the management a couple times about a high pitched noise that made sitting on the balcony or around the pools sometimes unbearable. A security person determined it was one of the pool pumps. It was so loud, we could hear it with the balcony door closed in the living area of the room and all the way out to the beach. My spouse approached a manager about it a second time and the manager was a smart [-]. He said, well you could move to the other pool. No sorry. No we will repair it. Even if we moved to the other pool, it was so loud it could be heard no matter where you went. Oh. And the really STUPID rule with the pool towels. Get this. You are allowed to check out towels and you need to launder them. You can't exchange them for fresh ones except for one time the entire stay. So, if you exchange ONE of your towels, early, say one towel fell into the pool and you didn't want to drag the sopping went towel up through the lobby, onto the elevator, down a hall and into the room, that counts as the one exchange. You are NOT ALLOWED to exchanged anymore towels. Really, every hotel I have ever stayed at allowed towel exchanges anytime. The pools outside were so cold it felt like there were ice cubes floating in it. The inside pools were not much warmer. The ocean in November was warmer than the pools. Like other people have mentioned, there are tons of hair floating in the pools and hot tub. Supposedly, they will be replacing the pool pumps this month, but come on. Did they ever hear of a pool skimmer? The lazy river looked greenish, but it might have been the paint color. In any case, none of my children were willing to take a chance on that. The pool water looked clean in all the pools I saw, except for the hair. It is a nice hotel. The lobby is nice. The pool areas are nice. I think it could be a very nice place if they get rid of just about all the management people and the stupid rules they have. And let me emphasis again, go through an owner. You will get a much better room and if anything happens, you can call the owner and not have to deal with the management at that hotel. I would only recommend this hotel to a friend if they rented a unit through the owners we used. I would suggest to a friend that they stay during a less busy season, like we did. We had no trouble finding chairs around the pool, check in was fast, it was quiet, and I think had it been busier, we would have ran into some of the problems other people mentioned.

This resort is labeled as a Wyndham resort, and only a few floors are dedicated to Worldmark owners. i first have to say that the the staff was friendly, there is an onsite little market place that is convenient, and the prices were reasonable. there is also an interior bar that we didnt get to experience because of the open times, however, the bar outside by the pool area that also served food, was fine enough. the location of the resort is smack dab in the middle of Daytona Beach and is right on the sand. there are many other hotels surrounding the Wyndham Ocean Walk, including the Ocean Walk shops, VERY CONVENIENT. there is a Sloppy Joes, a Mai Tai bar/restaurant, and many other touristy places to venture. we also had the opportunity to watch a Summer Jazz festival that was going on while we were there (Aug 15th). the patio at the Mai Tai bar had a perfect view of the stage while we sipped our coctails. there is also a family fun center literally across the street from the hotel on the adjacent block called Daytona Lagoon. very fun arcade for kids, water park, bumper boats, and go carts. the hotel itself had 2 different pools with a lazy river and 1 kiddie area. the main pool had a slide that the kids and adults enjoyed. while we were there, there was also a very large inflatable water slide that cost $20 unlimited per day, or $3 per ride. most of the kids LOVED this ride. i'm not sure how often this is available, but i assume it's for the entire summer. there is a gate entrance from the pool area that leads you directly onto Daytona's Beach...very convenient! there were also beach bicycle rentals directly on the beach, along with some snack trucks if you get hungry on the beach, and dont feel like pool bar food. the resort rooms themselves were very comparable to what we're used to at Worldmark. Fully stocked kitchen, washer/dryer. we stayed in a 3 bed 3 bath room because we had not only our family but two other families with us. we live in Jacksonville, FL, so it's only an hour and a few minutes away for a convenient weekend getaway, which is how we vacation anyway. the only thing i have to say about this resort, is it is a bit crowded for a Worldmark resort. as Worldmark owners, we do enjoy the exclusivity of being Worldmark/Trendwest owners. this Wyndham resort is extremely big with many accommodations, and was extremely busy...i'd say to capacity. i wouldnt say it was PACKED with people, but i will say that it was much busier than what we're used to with our exclusively Worldmark resorts. of course, this didnt bother the kids, since they just make new friends with the other families present. i'm guessing this hotel was this busy because we are in the Summer Vacation period, just before school starts. most families just want one last weekend getaway before the busy school year starts; this is the reason for us anyway. there is a put put miniature golf (free) on the 4th floor of the South tower, an underground pool hall and entertainment room, as well as an arcade right next door, an indoor pool, and even a business center with free internet where i saw a lot of teen agers facebooking :) there was no free internet in any of the rooms, but i suspect if you bring your laptop to the business center, there will have likely been wi-fi available. one last thing, the resort on the North side of the Wyndham buildings (opposite of the Ocean Walk side), did have a bar and pool of it's own. i believe this is the Hawaiian Inn Owner Rentals. our balcony and master bedroom faced the ocean, and the Hawaiian Inn's bar and pool were directly below us. at night, they have a singer there on Saturday night, and the noise came through the windows on our 14th floor that made it difficult to go to sleep. the music was on until about 1 am, so please take that into consideration. besides the noise from the neighboring hotel, and the amount of people, this resort was very nice, and very accommodating. i will say, that the floors reserved for Worldmark guests were VERY QUIET in comparison to the rest of the resort...likely on purpose. great hotel, great stay...definitely recommend for a FAMILY stay...", "Date": "August 16, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dawsonville, GA", "Title": "\u201cNot what it used to be....\u201d", "Author": "jbrockn2", "ReviewID": "UR75472018", "Content": "We have been staying @ Ocean Walk for over 10 years and this was undoubtable the worst stay in all those years.

They didn't do such a great job. The next day we had a flood under the sink. The crew that came back fixed it right the second time. Unfortunately our dryer was not working correctly, taking 4 hours to dry 3-4 beach towels.

We got the exact type of room that we requested with no problems. We stayed in a one-bedroom oceanfront. The room, while a little worn around the edges (perfectly understandable given the volume of people they cycle through there), was good size, and while the beds were firmer than I am used to, they slept surprisingly well. The room was adequately equipped with everything we needed. Plenty of towels and nice bed linens. The elevators were only slow on Saturday during check-in times. We had no issues with slow elevators for the rest of our stay. The pool was very crowded, and the chairs were usually full, but we never went without one for a long period of time. People were always coming and going, and several people offered to give up their extras when they saw us looking. I think people just need to be more realistic in their expectations. This is a condo, so there is no maid service. I've never been to a popular condo on the beach where pool chairs are not hard to come by, so that is not unique to this resort and should be expected. The rates were way less than a comparable room at the Hilton, so you can't expect Hilton quality. Manage your expectations, and you will be well pleased with this resort. We thought it was a great value. We loved the convenience to the Ocean Walk Village next door, and we played the indoor miniature golf course multiple times.

Would recommend that you bring a canopy or beach umbrella and chairs if you plan on sitting on the beach. A local company rents them for $30 a day (one umbrella, small side table and 2 lounge chairs), but that gets very expensive and given how hot the sun gets, we needed to fork over the money. Next time, we will bring our tailgating tent and chairs to save the money. On the downside, like the other postings, resort does need some updating...specifically, we thought the room furniture (esp the beds) needed new mattresses, carpet can use replacing and the 1980s beach decor was dated. Air conditioner was very loud as well. While everything worked just fine, hotel needs to start investing a bit. If it's important to you, I would also specify Ocean Front vs Ocean View. There is clearly a difference. We had ocean view (which we could see the ocean from our balcony...but it wasn't the ocean front we were hoping for (walk on to the balcony and all you see is ocean. Beware, too - we were on the north side of the building - we could see directly into the neighboring buildings and right above the garbage dumpsters. So, at 6pm (when we wanted to have a drink on the balcony, it stunk outside from the full dumpsters. We couldn't even enjoy our ocean view. Additionally, elevators got very crowded quickly - so when you can jump on one, do it, even if you need to go down a floor before going up. Timeshares are typically no-frills (no daily maid service, clean your own, sales pitches), so none of that was a surprise to us. Overall, for a timeshare resort, this one is a bit better than others that we've seen. We would consider staying here again if our travels point to the beach.

I was very glad I didn't change my hotel at the last minute (I almost did because the reviews were horrible!) Anyway, we arrived really early and our room wasn't ready. We were able to change into our swimsuits and store our clothes and our cooler full of food. The staff starting from the front door to the front desk were so nice. Even in a hallway they would go out of their way to speak to you. I never once encountered a rude employee. This hotel will definitely meet the needs of all family members. My sons are 12, 10 and 7. My oldest son was in a Rock Band concert and had a blast. My husband was in a pool tournament. They have rooms with computers and pool tables for adults only and then computers that kids can use. They have a putt putt golf course. )The concierge has a lot of great ideas and can get some good discounts in the area. I highly recommend Daytona Parasailing. They were great with my kids and made it a wonderful day. We were talked into the banana boat ride too - fun for the kids but I got knocked off everytime - to the joy of my sons! Parasailing crew was amazing and they take hundreds of pictures. We saw dolphins and a huge manaray.) Back to resort - The pools are great. The lazy river does look green but under close inspection it's the color it's painted not because it's dirty. By the end of the day the pools are dirty but that is to be expected with the number of people swimming all day. I saw them clean the pools every morning. The ocean in front of the hotel was always clean. You can rent umbrellas and chairs for $30 a day. Boogie boards for $5 a day. Every night they had a some fun event. I was never disappointed. On Saturday nights they have fireworks off the pier - that was neat to see. If you go into this resort with an open mind you will really enjoy your stay. We cleaned our towels every night - we had plenty of towels in our room. We cooked most of our meals and the kitchen provided all the utensils we needed. The blockbuster rental is only $1 a movie and they had new releases. The wait for the elevators around 5 p.m. got a little long but maybe 10 minutes or so. I traveled with my family of 5 and we were always able to find chairs and we were never down there at 8 a.m. I did see security pick up other people's stuff if they showed no sign of using the chairs. They do try to talk you into the timeshare program but I guess the incentive is $150 American Express gift card, a 3 day - 2 night stay at another resort and a late check out of 2 p.m. instead of 10 a.m. We weren't pestered about it - just once when we first arrived. The worst part was check in. It took almost an hour. I came in from the beach at 2 and our room still wasn't ready - so I came back at 3:45 and the line was miles long. They bring you fresh cookies while you wait and my husband brought me a cocktail from the bar so it wasn't so bad. We got to our room around 5 p.m. but it was gorgeous and worth waiting for! All in all it was a wonderful experience for us. I highly encourage those with kids of any age to check out the activity center on the Lower Level. They have something for all ages - games you can take back to your room - suggestions for the older ones - it was just a really great vacation for us and I am SO glad I didn't change resorts at the last minute. It would be nice if they had internet in the rooms - that was a downside for sure.", "Date": "July 28, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Davie", "Title": "\u201cVery Disappointed\u201d", "Author": "njl3777", "ReviewID": "UR72553240", "Content": "I booked my room on-line not knowing that this was not a hotel it is a time share.

We decided to take a vacation in Daytona Beach and none of us had ever been there. We have never taken a family vacation and it was up to me to book and plan the trip. I got on the internet, searched vacation condos in Daytona Beach on vacationrentals.com and several rentals popped up. The pictures and description of the Ocean Walk were tempting, so I contacted the agent/owner listed and made the arrangements. She was very friendly and helpful. I also felt that she was very upfront with me. She explained that even with a request for an oceanfront condo, we might not get it. Our condo may be situated on a corner that had a view of the city and the beach. It was only after I booked and paid that I started looking at reviews of the place and my heart sank. There were tons of unfavorable ones and very few good reviews. I was almost sick. I decided to just make the most of our vacation and hope for the best. After a hellish trip from SW Indiana, we got to the resort. With six of us and tons of luggage, we took two cars. There is room for one car at the resort's parking garage and the other car (if you take two) has to be parked elsewhere. The only place we could find was across the street at the Ocean Walk Shops parking garage. That cost around $16 a day. Next time we will try to find cheaper parking for the extra car. Our trip entailed a two hour traffic jam so I had called the resort to let them know we would be arriving a couple of hours late. They noted it and assured me it was no problem. Let me first address the \"cons\" I read about and what I found in comparison. Crowded busy check-in: Folks, it's a huge resort with tons of people checking in. It's going to be busy. Be patient. If you didn't get the condo you thought you were getting, I bet it's not the desk clerk's fault. No maid/cleaning service/laundry service: The website makes it clear that there are washer/dryers in each unit so you can do your laundry. This isn't a hotel. You are responsible for cleaning, doing dishes, and such. I don't know how so many people misunderstood that unless they just did not read the descriptions. Need for more elevators and luggage carts: Huge problem. The resort is comprised of two towers with at least 23 floors (?) each. Only four elevators for each tower??? It gets very crowded and lines form at check-in, check-out, and when rain drives everyone in from the pool/beach. I don't know how many luggage carts there are, but they need more. Not only are they used for luggage, but we found it necessary, as did others, for hauling groceries to the condo. Be prepared to leave your driver's license to use a luggage cart. That being said, we absolutely fell in love with the Ocean Walk!!! We did get an oceanfront room with a beautiful view from the 19th floor of the north tower. The 2 bedroom condo was on a corner, the kitchen had the basics needed for cooking and dining for a family of eight. There were six of us, two parents and four children ages 20-8. We loved having the beach just steps from the resort. The putt-putt course on the 4th floor came in handy when rain came, as did the computer rooms and arts and crafts studio. There are tons of brochures and coupons available from the concierge. We opted out of the \"sales pitch\" and were never once pressured to attend or buy. The mini-mall next to the resort I found to be noisy, crowded, and pricey. Our stay was fairly low-key. Deep sea fishing, parasailing, and shopping was as exciting as we got. We loved it. The pools and lazy river all seemed very nice and the kids enjoyed all of them daily. Me, I want the beach. There is a towel service for beach towels. You can check out towels but be warned, it is $15 for each towel you lose and don't turn back in. We took our own beach towels, but used theirs also to keep from doing laundry all the time. We also took extra bath towels and that turned out to be a good idea. We were supplied with several bath towels, washcloths, kitchen towels, a few rolls of paper goods, some trash bags, small packets of laundry detergent and dishwasher soap, and some bath soap and shampoo. Go shopping when you get there to stock up. The washer/dryers are stacked units and small. One night the a/c didn't seem to be cooling. I called about it and had help within two minutes. They instructed what to do and even waited while I tried it. Remember to turn on the icemaker when you get there. All in all, I was surprised by the bad reviews I read. Maybe your experience depends on when you go. Maybe it's how the owner/agent handles the unit. Maybe some people are just never happy.

Good luck getting a chair at the pool, they get taken up as soon as they open the pool gates. Parking is bad, if you do not come back by around 10pm or so the parking garage is full, then when you walk from the parking garage to the hotel you wonder if you are going to get mugged or not, then when you try to open the side door to the hotel from the garage, good luck getting it to open with your room key. The pools were good, but too many people, hard to get a chair. The bars were great. The best part is when you go to their NO PRESSURE SALES PITCH to buy into their timeshare, the no pressure is bull crap, it should have been 90 minutes, we were there over 4 hours, and talk about being pressured to buy, they give you no time to think it over, you sign now, or if you don't the price goes up if you come back. They finance thru a credit card company, they got us a cheap payment, at 2.9% for 7 months, so at first it sounded like a good deal but they fail to tell you that it jumps to 16.9% after the 7 months, unless you ask, all I can say is make sure you do the math, and ask questions, and don't forget about the monthly maintenance fee, this adds up, so it is not as good of a savings as you first think.

She requested several times for him to stop, moved and he continue to purposely step on her toes. My 16 year old son told him to stop as well as the cousin. After the elevator stopped and my kids got off, the thugs got off and followed them to the parking lot. One of them punched my cousins child in the nose - blood everywhere. My kids went to the front desk to report. After I found out, myself and my cousin was with them - police, medics came. We requested they pull video - we wanted to file charges. They were older and these were 16 year old boys. My kids had perfect description and knew what floor they had punched. They were to contact us when the found them. After leaving, I had a bad feeling they were not going to even look for them. They had also punched a hole in the wall by the elevator. The thug actually knocked his girlfriend around some in all the commotion. This was a nightmare, and needless to say ruined the vacation. We were scared to let the kids leave us after that. The child with the broke nose is in surgery today. He also has nerve damage. The hotel cleaned up the blood and patched the hole in the wall really quickly, but never contacted us again to see how he was doing or anything. As the week went on, his face got worse looking and hurting more. I phoned the hotel today to let them know I was disappointed in them never following up. That I worried about them in the ocean and on the strip, but didn't know I had to worry about them in that nice hotel. I was just told I would need to contact the Daytona Police Department - that their security wouldn't be able to arrest or do anything. There was absolutely NO CONCERN over this severely injured 16 year old boy. I find this very disturbing as well as everyone I've told this to. PLUS<<<<< the elevator is a nightmare. At some times the line would be 50 people long,,,you would have to wait 5 or 6 times to be able to get on. The parking was just as bad. You had to hurry home from eating because after about 10:00 there were no parking places left (they only allow you one). If you don't have one, oh well - park across the street and pay 20.00 a day. The room was nice, but did have a hugh roach when we arrived waiting for us! They provided us with 2 washclothes. Luckily we had a washer & dryer and I had brought my own washclothes.

Having needed a couple of ketchup packages for some burgers we cooked in our only pot...I went to the tiki bar to pick up a few and was met by the condiment nazi that interrogated me for five minutes to decide whether or not I could have the ketchup. I had to lie, then give up my room number and say I just bought the burgers from the restaurant or she was not giving up the goods. $200 a night and I had to wrestle for 3 packs of ketchup. That was it for me. I choose not to wrestle for pool chairs or ketchup with a rough crowd bearing \"jail ink\" tattoos.

One pool had an amazing amount of human hair floating in it and the other had thick grease smeared on the sides. The lazy river was an unusual shade of green which my 8 year old thought was due to the resort using real river water- sadly, she was wrong. Parking was terrible. Our non-smoking suite had cigarrette burns and the bed had blood stains. We were told they weren't planning on cleaning our room when we called about the blood, but after 2 calls and 4 hours, they did bring us some fresh bedding to change on the bed. Towels were strictly allocated and limited, but fortunately, the units have washers and dryers so you can wash the towels yourself. Check-out is early- 10 am- which would normally be okay except for the significant elevator problems and tight restrictions on luggage cart usage. With the exception of the employee who greeted us in the driveway, all employees were flippant and acted as though we were trying to scam them out of something(like clean bedding!). Also, they employ a person to go door to door to make sure that you do not overstay. While I can certainly appreciate the need to turn the rooms over quickly to prepare them for the next set of guests, I think there is a better way then having a person with a clipboard knock on your door at 10:02(not exagerating) and ask why you weren't gone yet(happened to friends). The kitchens are hit or miss as to how well stocked they are with utensils and cookware(we had friends staying in the same resort, so could pull together a spoon, pot, and colander between 3 rooms). My family used the stairs whenever possible (10 flights!) and the stairwell smelled of urine. Of course, we had numerous offers to buy timeshares while staying there. Also, security was very poor. Security guards roam the pool area to make sure that everyone has a wrist band who is using the pool, but the actual hotel is completely open to anyone who would wish to enter and you will receive several flyers each night under your door from local pizza delivery places. It is a shame because the hotel has the potential to be a nice place...I would have just laughed about the parking and the elevator had the hotel had a pleasant staff.

DO NOT rent from Wyndham/Holiday Express!!! I rented from a private owner last year and was VERY satisfied. I did not have a single problem. This year I made the mistake of renting from Wyndham or Holiday Express and will never rent through them again. I rented and paid for a 618 square foot studio suite that was supposed to have two beds, a couch, little living room area, kitchenette and an ocean view. When I checked in at the Wyndham, the front desk failed to advise that the air conditioning had been broke for over 24 hours. I soon realized that was the least of my concerns. After we brought our luggage to our room, I realized that Wyndham must have put me in the wrong room. Our room was no more than 300 square feet, no couch, no ocean view, unless I leaned over the balcony and looked beyond a building and only one of the two burners worked on the stove. The room was not updated as the pictures on the website shows. There was a VCR with a 32\u201d bulky TV. The wall paper was tearing off the wall. The furniture was hideous with what appeared to be grease stains smeared all over. I have stayed at cheap hotels with nicer living conditions. The stove had grease an inch thick and the floors were very filthy. Having three adults and a toddler, this was not a room I wanted to stay in for the next 8 days. I immediately called the manager on duty, Guido, and explained to him that I am supposed to be in a studio suite and not a one person efficiency studio and that my room was filthy (I have photos of the filth that I will attach. If they are not with this review - this means management took them off and did not want you to view them.!..) and there was not an ocean view balcony. Guido advised that I was indeed in the wrong room, but there was nothing he could do because there were no more rooms available. He did not offer to have my room cleaned, a refund - NOTHING. He told me there is not one thing he can do to fix my problem. He gave a name and number and told me to contact that person at Holiday Express. I called the number three times that week and left three messages, but never received a call back. Luckily we had beautiful weather and did not have to be in our room much; I love the resort and will go back but would never rent through the Wyndham/Holiday Express again. On my last day, I explained my room situation to another manager who advised that I would receive 30% back on my charge card the following Monday for the \"room mistake\". I would have rather had more space in our room, been in the correct room with nicer living conditions and been able to hang our clothes instead of the four of us living out of suitcases for 8 days than the 30% money back.", "Date": "July 11, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Huntsville, Alabama", "Title": "\u201cExcellent location for families.\u201d", "Author": "crchild18", "ReviewID": "UR70263910", "Content": "The Wyndham Ocean Walk is a very crowded destination for families.

This wasnt fair, because by the time we got out there at 10am nothing was left! Too many people for the size of the pools lounges, but the beach is just a hop, skip & a jump away, right behind the pool area.

Be aware tho if your bringing more than 1 car in your party(per room) you have to park across the street at the muni lot, and they charge a fortune! They charge you $8 per every 12 hours, but you have no choice to put your car anywhere else. It cost me $64 to get my car out!!

The lady at the front said she would reimburse me, just to bring her a list or a reciept, wich I did then we never heard from her again. The repair man was in and out that evening for about four hours, sometimes two of the to fix the problem, they replace the fan, but the fridge never did cool right. On to night number two. This was the start of a very hot vacation. The airconditioning in the room stopped woking, once again, repair men all over the place, they temporarily fixed the problem, only for the air to quit working again the next morning, we were told they were still working on the problem that they merely put a \"band-aid\" on the previous night, wich at $230.00 a night, Im sorry but I do expect more than a band-aid! On to the thirsd and final night of the trip, once again no air, and its late june in Florida and 100 degree weather! This time we did not get a repair man we were promised one, but he never showed up. Upon complaining to a manager, Jared Lunea, we were promised back a full refund from the nights stay that we did not have air. I was happy with that even thou it was two hot sweaty evenings my family and I spent with no air, but the problem is this, we never got the refund. We continue to call and leave messages and still get no return phone calls, we were then directed to another gentleman by the name of Peter with a Orlando phone number who is supposed to be in charge of the refunds, can't get passed his voicemail or even get a call back.

My son loved the water slide, the security people were all very friendly and helpful and I am glad they were there to move people's stuff out of the chairs when they didn't return after HOURS of leaving their stuff behind. While seating at the pool was very limited for the amount of people staying at the resort, we had no problems getting chairs at 9 am and after. We were there to have a fun and relaxing vacation and that was exactly what we did. I think the difference might be in renting through an individual rather than through Wyndham but we never had any problems with the a/c, elevators or any of the other issues people have brought up in their reviews. Kip helped us with our luggage when we got there and when we left so that was great. I think that having a good attitude went a long way in making our stay most enjoyable. We loved being right next door to all of the restaurants and fun along the boardwalk. I honestly cannot wait to get back down there for our next trip and I never thought I would say that about Daytona Beach. We pre-registered around noon on the Saturday that we arrived and were able to use the pool and all the resort amenities until our room was ready at 4. It would have been nice to be able to get in our room sooner, but we knew going in that it wouldn't be ready until 4, so no big deal. Again, I would recommend going through a private owner to get the best deal and best accommodations.

We have our own pool and travel often and these pools did not seem very chlorinated. Also lots of hair was in the one pool. Although the pool play area and play room for kids was very nice. We didn't ever see anyone cleaning the items. Are there other kids out there sick??? I am sure there are since this is contagious. Please let me know. Please be aware. You had to stand in line in the morning to get chairs at the pool, it was a mad dash everyday at 8:15. They close the pool at 12 and they closed the entire deck. So you could not sit outside and socialize if you wanted to after 12. I have never seen this before anywhere. I have seen the pools close early but not the deck. The bars closed very early, normally by 11 but on the Friday night we were there it actually closed at 9. Not sure the theory behind this. The activities were plentiful if you have kids.

For example, upon arrival, you have to leave your driver's license in order to get a shabby falling apart luggage cart that you have to \"check out\". Then you have to check out Towels and promise to pay for them if you lose one. There are so few chairs by the pool area that you are not allowed to leave your towels on them for more than 30 minutes or the security gaurd will take them to allow someone else to have a seat. So if you go up to your room for lunch then you might as well surrender your spot by the pool. Anyway, the pools are dirty and the lazy river has not been cleaned in a long while. There are never enough floating rafts for you to get in. They are not policed like the towels so you can stand there and wait for a raft and you still might not get one. If you want to go to the beach, the area in front of the resort is very crowded and the local chair/umbrella company sets up their rentals on the first line at the beach. These cost $25.00 day. So four days at the beach, $100.00 if you didn't bring your own chairs. If you did bring your own chairs you have to try to squeeze them somewhere in between or behind the ones that are already set up, unless you wait for the tide to go out, then you have to worry about it coming back in, soaking all of your stuff.

The location is nice, seeing how it is right on the beach and there are plenty of shops and eateries close by. We also really liked the variety of pools etc... We had some issues with the room that wasn't so pleasant. Ready? We rented our room #1305 from a private owner...(I will NEVER do that again). This is the first time I booked an actual condo, therefore I didn't really know what I was doing. We needed a couple extra trashbags a couple days before we left and the front desk told me that our room was considered no entry (because it was privately owned) therefore I could purchase them at the eatery down in the lobby. We were supposed to have a starter supply of laundry soap and we had none. When my 13 yr. old son went to the front desk to ask for some, the guy told him, \"Well, I'm not supposed to give this to you, but here. If the person you are renting from said they would have some in your room, then there should be some in there.\" So yes, I appreciated him giving us some, even tho it sucked, but his attitude was wrong about the situation. I noticed right away that the hotel and especially once you stepped off the elevators, had a nasty smell. It smelled like pee or dirty socks or something. The elevators were always so slow!! I think the fact that the bedroom windows faced the hallway was a little weird. I was thinking the bedroom windows would of faced the beach. The washing machine sucked! It didn't even wash the clothes. The room itself looks so outdated! With the money they are bringing in at that place, you would think they would update!!!! The carpet and couch was nasty! The ice box was loud, the ice maker quit working mid way through our trip and water started coming out of the bottom of the fridge. I contacted the maint. man that we were told to call with any issues and I couldn't even get his # to go through, so I called the front desk and told them and I had to leave a voicemail for the building maint. man. I never received a call back nor was the stuff fixed before we left. The lock on the sliding balcony door was broke. Since it was considered a 'safety hazard' they sent someone up quickly to fix it and I wish I could remember his name because he was sooooo nice!!! There were dishes left in the dishwasher....I couldn't tell you if they were clean or dirty. The room stank. There was what looked as blood smeared on the bathroom floor next to the wall between the 2 bathroom doors and there was also some on the front of one of the dresser drawers. The toilet wouldn't flush right. There was hair all over the bathroom floor, around the toilet and tub etc...The shower curtain...OMG! It was molded on both sides from top to bottom!!!! There wasn't even a liner on the shower. It was a cloth shower curtain! I also assumed (could be my fault) that we would of had at least one dish rag and one dish towel, and there was nothing. I would of brought my own, but was under the impression that if there were towels, there would of been dish towels too. The condo just wasn't clean. I have emailed the lady we rented it from 2 days ago and haven't heard anything as of yet. I stated all these issues with her and told her that I would want to know if the cleaning co.

Pool area and beach were both nice and kids did several crafts in activity center, and the ice cream with warm cookies on the pool deck were delicious. Only complaint was elevators were crowded on Saturday afternoon because of check ins, (Was told almost 500) so had to wait at times.

(You can get maid service for extra $$.) Some people were also upset they had a strip view instead of an ocean view, I had made sure of our room view when I purchased it. It may make a difference whether you book thru Ocean Walk or an owner. Very convenient to Ocean Walk Shops, Daytona Lagoon, Starlite Diner, Boardwalk/Pier area.

Off the lobby their is a small store which sells snacks and it closes at 9pm after which if you want a candy bar good luck. For the good. Next door to the resort is 5-6 places to eat and a movie theater. On Friday and Saturday nights they have music next to the resort for no fee. Their is a very small water park and putt putt golf across the street and when I say small maybe 1 1/2 acres total. The Hilton next door has a GREAT steak house called PRIME. To sum up my experience. I have not been to Daytona Beach in 10 years. It is ran down bad. Hotels have broken windows and are closed on the beach. Stores are closed and not much to do other than what is in a 2 block area from this hotel. The boardwalk is closed for remodeling till end of the year and the rides by the boardwalk are the old carnival rides that are pulled by trucks to local carnivals.

Check-in was somewhat easy. Problems first arose when we got to the room. The lock on the sliding glass door was busted and the alarm clock didn't work. Took 2 hours for front desk to send up staffmember to fix lock. Alarm clock issue was found to be the fact that it was plugged into a switch-controlled outlet (why you would do this, I don't know). Room had good amenities - a kitchenette with fridge, sink, dishwasher, and burners. One of two burners didn't work. Room had \"ocean view\" but only if you craned your neck while standing on balcony. No service. At no point did any member of the housekeeping staff come to our room without us begging for such service. We asked the front desk if housekeeping service was included in our stay - and they said of course. However, two days into our stay, no one had come and made the beds or given us towels or taken out trash. When we called to ask for new towels and sheets, we were told \"But you have a washing machine, so we don't provide towels.\" The problem was - we didn't have a washing machine. The staffmember on the phone realized her mistake: \"Oh, you guys are in the hotel part, not the rental part! My apologies. Let me ask - what size bed do you have?\" The fact that the staffmember did not know what size beds we had pretty much summed up the problem. Between two and three hours later, someone came by and dropped off a stack of towels and sheets. I believe the problem is that this Whyndam oversees both the \"hotel\" business and the \"vacation rental\" business. They seem to have no feel for which patrons are staying in which type of rooms - or at least serviced my room as if we were renters. The pool is nice, but on a busy weekend such as Memorial Day, there is zero chance of getting a chair unless you go down and \"claim\" it before the pool opens. Hotel pool rules specificially prohibit claiming chairs - but this is not enforced.

I went with my husband and 20 year old daughter. This place is way over priced and way, way over rated! The first room was, (after we managed to get security to let us in because the electronic lock was broken) not the size room I reserved and paid for in advance and it was torn apart. The carpet was disgusting. The walls trashed and the vases or whatnots on the shelf next to the TV were broken and had sharp pointy edges. Luckily for our family we do not have small children. The couch, chair and stove where torn apart as if someone was in the middle of searching for something or perhaps got interrupted during cleaning. The trash was on the on top of the bar where guest are supposed to eat. I called to complain about the size and condition of the room and was told \"Rooms are not guaranteed.\" What? They sure as heck took my money in advance to guarantee that I would show up! The least they could have done was to give me what I paid for! I was told \"there is nothing we can do the resort is booked.\" No apologies on the wrong room no nothing - just tough. The front desk did agree to send someone up to clean the room, but when the maid got there all she did was drop off a couple of bars of hand soap and leave without cleaning a stinking thing. So resigned to getting ripped off and stuck in a substandard filthy room, my husband and I go to the bedroom to unpack for our two day stay and found that the linen was visibly filthy. I called down and ask for clean linen. Of course they didn't bring it so I had my daughter call back down and ask again. This time a male staff member was extremely RUDE to my daughter and asked her why I wanted clean linen. You would think that an explanation for clean linen would not be needed. The TV remote didn't work which wasn't a big deal until I tried to turn it on manually and found that the on/off button had been removed or yanked out. There was a whole where normally a button would be and I wasn't about to stick my finger in it so I called to ask for batteries. I think this fourth, fifth or sixth call to the front desk finally made them take note and miraculously a room (the type I paid for) became available. So now we are in room two after wasting hours of our vacation time. We get in this second room which at first glance seems to be cleaner and in better working order. We go about our day trying to enjoy the pool which by now is filled to capacity with nowhere to sit. We won\u2019t discuss the issue with the pool towels and the policy on getting a clean one. Suffice to say, bring your own detergent. We go get lounge chairs and take them down to the beach where finally we can start to relax on our vacation. That night, my daughter goes to make her bed on the pull out couch only to find that she has no pillows. We only had three undersized flat pillows on our bed so we call down and ask for three more pillows. Two were to be used by my daughter and another one for me since a recent surgery requires I maintain a certain posture. This usually isn't a problem with most resorts. At any rate, I wait up fully dressed, listening to what seems like the loudest air conditioner on the planet and smelling something rotten emanating from the AC closet, so that I can answer the door when the pillows arrive. That of course never happened. I woke up fully dressed still waiting on pillows the next morning. We called down to the front desk another two or three times that day asking for pillows, only to be told that the maid or runner said she left them in the room (we were in the room \u2013 no one came). My daughter assured the front desk that we did not receive pillows, but was treated very rudely and suspiciously by staff again. Finally after hours of waiting and fussing with staff my husband and I went down to the beach. I won\u2019t even go into the third degree the man at the wristband counter gave me when I tried to get wristbands for the pool area for day two. Apparently you have to put the hospital like disposable wristbands on loosely enough to take them off when you are not at the pool are (which for my husband is impossible) or wear the hideous red thing for however long your stay is, because they are only going to give you one. At any rate, my daughter calls me shortly after we leave the room to tell me, much to my horror and utter disbelief, that staff sent a runner to search our room. That was it! That was all the abuse I was going to take from these over puffed, over inflated, pompous you know what's, so I went to talk to management face to face. I calmly, because you get more flies with honey, asked for the manager in charge and was greeted by a very friendly young lady who assured me that they would be dealing with the runner who had the audacity to search a guest\u2019s room. I explained part of the ordeal that we had been put through over the past couple of days and she seemed sympathetic. She told me to expect a phone call from a Robert somebody within the next couple of days. That never happened. I asked for corporation\u2019s phone number on day one from a staff member at the front desk, but found that when I tried to call it, it was a bogus number! We checked out before 10:00 a.m. on our scheduled departure day. We could not wait to say good riddance to the so highly rated pathetic excuse of a resort. We all vowed to let anyone who asked us about the place know exactly what happened and what we thought. We vowed to NEVER AGAIN visit Wyndham's Ocean Walk Daytona. You would think the mistreatment would stop there, but nooo. Low and behold, when I got my credit card statement you will never guess what they did. You would expect that after knowing what their staff did to our family or how crappy and out of shape the rooms were that they put us in, they would give us a small discount, but noooo. They charged us for an extra room and I have been given nothing but the run around for going on two weeks trying to get it off my credit card! I\u2019ve called the direct line of the gentleman that I booked the vacation with but he said he can\u2019t do anything about it because it was a charge that the hotel or resort or whatever they claim to be, put on my card. I talked to several people at the resort before getting a hold of a manager or assistant manager who requested a copy of my credit card statement (of which I emailed her over a week ago). She stated that she would call me back the next day. But you know that never happened either! I\u2019ve left her voicemail after voicemail, but all I hear are crickets. I have been reduced to disputing the charge on my credit card. My next stop, other than letting everyone under the sun know how miserable a state the resort is in and how absolutely despicable the staff members are, is to make a complaint with their local better business bureau, and the Central Florida Visitors bureau.

After reading some of the reviews, we were trying not to get our hopes up. However, our 2 bedroom condo on the 21st floor of the north tower was just beautiful! We would not hesitate to return! We stayed in a unit that had recently been rennovated. We got it through a time share exchange, so hotel units and personally owned units may be different. The paint had been changed from the retro colors to a sea foam green and tan. The art work was new and attractive. The kitchen had granite. Close inspection showed that the stove was older, but the fridge and dishwasher seemed fairly new. The kitchen was extremely well stocked for all cooking needs. Some people commented on previous reviews that the beds were bad, but all three of us thought the beds were great and all slept well.The view from our balcony was toward the north, but we enjoyed the view of the Halifax river as well as the ocean. We loved the sun in the afternoon when the beach was too windy and got some good sunsets over the river, too. The pool area was crowded, but we only sat by the pool a couple of times. Otherwise, we were out on the beach. The hotel does not have its own chairs down by the water. Of course, local businesses rent two chairs, a table and an umbrella for $30. We bought chairs (2 from Kangaroo Express for 20 and one from Walgreens for 15), used them all week and left them behind. Much better deal unless you really need the shade. Kangaroo is just a short hop half a block to the north and Walgreens is just up by the corner of Atlantic and Seabreez ( a block and a half). There is a liquor store about 4 blocks up Atlantic on the west side of the street. I would not go up there at night, but during the afternoon, it was fine. Between those 3 places we found most everything we needed, including some fruit for breakfast. We ate out at several places. I have to say Ocean Deck was my favorite. It has great vacation atmosphere and yummy salads. It is just an easy 15 min walk down the beach going south. Hyde Park Prime Rib was a nice night out on Sun. and they have a 20 special all evening on Sun. We also went there for $4 cocktails one afternoon. Had a delicious lunch at Caribbean Jacks. All the hotel personnel we met were very helpful. Perhaps more were added, but we had 3 security guard patrolling the pool the whole time. Felt very safe.

We were hesitant to stay there because last year the pools were FREEZING (had nothing to do with the weather because the pool at our resort was great) and it took our 6yo a while to get in. During our stay the pools were fine, could have been a little warmer but swimmable. The resort is great because you can walk to things if you want (great location) and you really don't have to leave unless you want. pools were clean enough although the toddler pool could have been a little cleaner. Check in/ check out was no problem, although we were doing it at days/times that weren't real busy. I did see a lot of people in line at busy times. The \"market\" was great for breakfast and the drinks at the pool bar, while pricey, are very good. The only real negative I have about this resort would be service, but not with the people.

I have to go all the was to the \"sun center\" (or whatever it is called), leave my ID, go out to the car, get my stuff, go to the room, go all the back to the place to return the dolly. Its not a big deal but put them in a central location so people don't have to \"work\" to do things.

The Ocean Walk Cond-Resort is a perfect place to stay for a family with kids or teenagers. We have always gone to Panama but with the weather being so cold we moved East for Spring Break. Our 2 bdr condo reservations were made at the last minute (thurs. nite arrived on Sat) When we called the hotel they told us that they did not have any more rooms on the ocean front. We did not want to go on vacation and not have an oceanfront view so we checked out the www.VRBO.com web site and put in our arrival info. and Bingo! 2 Bdrm suite oceanfront rooms were avaialble. We called the owner up and booked the room. Very easy! Room was VERY nice with 2 bdrm, 2 baths, 2 kitchens, 2 living rooms, 2 sets of washer and dryer, and 4 nice size tvs. and yes jacuzzi tub in the room as well. We stayed on the 23 floor and did not have any throubles with the elevators at all. They had 4 working elevators in the north tower and we never had to wait long at all. We had 4 teenager and 1 child plus 2 adults and the room slept up to 11 people very nicely. The water pressure was perfect in the showers and I couldn't believe that we NEVER ran out of hot water. All of the showers and tub's drained very well. The decor in our room was perfect. They do differ from owner to owner. The hotel comes with 2 outdoor heated pools which the water was very comfortable for the kids....even at nite. There are 3 hot tubs outside that were really a nice size and they were cleaned every morning. The lazy river was full of kids but it is not heated. There is a bar/restaurant on the pool deck that is also very convenient. The only bad thing about the pool area is the sun is blocked off about 2:30 p.m. every day because of the resort towers. We spent all of our time on the beach which by the way is a \"no driving car zone\" beach. Loved that!!! I really loved the food trailers that they have on the beach which makes it very convenient to grab some awsome onion rings, chili chese fris, etc.! These food trailers also rent bikes, tricycles, boogie boards, lawnchairs, etc. at a very cheap rate. Kids loved that!! Right outside our resort is Ocean Walk shops. This was sooooo awsome because the kids could walk there by themselves and there was so much to do and see. Movie 10 theater, beach shops, ice cream, awsome restaurants...all right outside our condo. Our favorite rest. was Sloppy Joe's...wonderful atmosphere and great food. Our hotel also provided activities at night for the kids...they had movie night at the pool, and karoke !

Booking was a little confusing, as I didn't fully realize that I was essentially renting someone's timeshare. Whatever, I'm not picky that way. Picked out a one-bedroom deluxe oceanfront. Arrived around 8:30 PM, no problems checking in. Go up to my room, it's as advertised, looks very nice, clean, beautiful ocean view. Then I step onto the carpet. It squishes under my feet. Investigate further, water is on the tile floor by the toilet and the carpet where it meets the tile is soaked. Determine it's clean water, decide to leave well enough alone. By the next evening it's dry. Layout of the room is nice, everything was clean, kitchen was very well provisioned (I could have made waffles!), beautiful whirlpool tub and big shower. Even had packets of laundry detergent to use in the washer and dryer. Absolutely no complaints except for the standing water. Only other odd thing was that every window and the sliding glass door were all unlocked. The strike plate for the door was also loose. Fixed those things myself. I'm an engineer; I couldn't leave it like that... Go get my \"Welcome Packet\" the next evening and learn it's a marketing ploy to get you to listen to a timeshare sales pitch. Fortunately I'm busy all day every day and the nice lady behind the counter was not pushy. At this point I learn that the only food available here is vending machines or the glorified convenience store that is only open in the morning and early afternoon. Good thing the Ocean Walk Village is right next door. Come back to the room, flip open my laptop, start looking for Internet access. No joy. Only place it's available is in the lobby, but I could sit anywhere and it was free, just like the parking. Even though it was only about 50 degrees Fahrenheit outside the next morning, the outdoor pool was like a bathtub. Lazy river, etc. was all in working order. Wonderful! There was always a security guard out front and usually in the pool area. I never felt unsafe, even when walking back late at night. That may have been because the oceanfront was completely dead due to cold weather, etc. On the last day, I needed to store my suitcase while I attended the conference. It took an inordinate amount of time to locate a bellman to put my bag in the \"closet.\" When he did finally show up, he did not have any claim tickets with him and just handed me a piece of paper with a couple of details as my \"ticket.\" As a result of all this I was ten minutes late to the meeting. Go back to pick it up, again, no bellman, walk back with the maintenance guy to get my back from the \"closet.\" It was an unused meeting room at the back corner of the hotel. It was not locked. This whole process took nearly 20 minutes. Ended up scrambling to make my return flight. Fortunately I only had to go back to DAB and not MCO. So, long story short, it's a beautiful hotel with a nice swimming area, but not much else. It is a great location, though.

It was a slow week at the resort so it was quite nice and relaxing and at times that provided us a sense of exclusivity. We did extensive research beforehand, ruling out two others (St Maarten and the higher end Ocean Vista) and eventually chose Ocean Walk for its convenient location, abundant facilities/activities including indoor pools which were important for us given the time of year. We were overall quite pleased with our stay as the kids had tons of fun with the pools and mini golf, and participated in daily activities (although some charges for the activities appeared a bit high) and the adults thoroughly enjoyed the nice roomy hot spas and the reasonably equipped gym. As others mentioned the choice of booking was confusing. We were quoted (four months before our intended stay) $1,800 by a resort rep who tried to convince us that there was only one unit left and we had to reserve that day to keep it (yeah right!) We also searched various vacation rental sites and found individual owned lock-out units which were going for around $1,200; We then discovered brokered 3-brm timeshare units on auction sites for as low as $500. As we were not interested in the high pressure sales or the high price provided from the resort, or a lock-out unit (apparently the only way to get a real North Tower 3-brm unit is either through the resort or from timeshares), we called up a couple of the brokers and were assured that their other customers had been quite happy with the quality of the rooms. They were right and we are so happy that we got a wonderful stay at a great bargain. My advice to anyone considering Ocean Walk is to do your homework and understand what you are looking for and what the resort can offer. Ocean Walk is a largely timeshare owned resort and not a high-end first-class hotel. Some of the negatives we noted were - lack of internet in the rooms (it was available in the lobby/bar/restaurant area and we were told that it will be available in the guest rooms starting Jan 2010); three of the four treadmills did not work although we were the only ones at the gym. minor stains on couches; the windows of the two smaller bedrooms face the hallway so did not have any views; the balcony does not extend ourside the master bedroom and is partially open to next door neighbor (we believe it is intended so that the views are not blocked though it does raise security concern); and for whatever reason the master bedroom window is designed to not be openable. However given that we had read most of these issues and had our expectations well adjusted and that the price we paid is unbeatable, we were quite happy with our choice.

It was the most amazing and relaxing vacation that either of us have had. We had an ocean view room on the 24th floor of the North Tower. The views were incredible. The room was beautifully decorated and very clean. The jacuzzi tub was an added bonus. The large stand up shower was relaxing. Everything about the room was great, the only thing we wished we had was opening windows in the bedroom so we could hear the ocean better at night. The central air was very efficient. Full kitchen ammenities and the washer/dryer were great to have. The hotel itself is a self contained community with every ammenity at your fingers. The basement floor has a inground pool, yoga studio, fitness center, childrens play center, billiards game room, computer center and more. There is a miniature golf course on the 4th floor. Ground level has a inground pool, eatery and bar. Outdoor pool area was incredible! Every morning we floated around the lazy river for awhile and then jumped in the pools and took great advantage of the water slide. I especially appreciated that the pools are 6ft deep in parts .... I know that in Orlando you are lucky to find a pool that gets to 5ft deep! Oh, and I'd like to add that the outdoor pools were NOT overly chlorinated! Infact, it was the cleanest and least chlorinated pool I have ever swam in. The indoor pools however, though very warm and inviting, did sting your nose and eyes a bit. It is a 1 minute walk from the pool area to \"OceanWalk\", where there are a variety of eateries, shops and even a 3 story movie theater! (The theater was awesome, seats were very comfortable). Across the street is a water park and indoor fun park. The water park was to our dismay closed for the season during our stay. We loved this hotel and can't wait to go back! It was the most relaxing vacation ever .... from the comforts of the room, to the magnitude of activites within walking distance ... from the refreshing pools to swimming in the warm ocean and walks along the beach, from Starbucks every morning to Coldstone IceCream for afternoon dessert .... and sitting at the maitai bar under the tiki torches and watching electric storms over the ocean .... absolutely amazing!", "Date": "October 31, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Location": "4", "Service": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Florida", "Title": "\u201cRobbed at the Wyndham Ocean Walk Daytona Beach-Biketoberfest\u201d", "Author": "jarrd", "ReviewID": "UR47185449", "Content": "My husband and I were on vacation at the Wyndham Ocean Walk Resort in Dayton on Atlantic Drive this past week of October 12-18th, for biketoberfest. The accommodations were lovely, clean and the staff was very professional at reception. Than a call came on Tuesday morning 10-13-09 at 4:30am that there had been an \u201cincident\u201d in the garage, both of our motorcycles and several others had been vandalized and burglarized, with items taken. My husband couldn\u2019t go back to sleep so he used the Internet in the lobby (no wyfi in the rooms at this time). Upon his return I asked him if he had the camera, he said no, that is when we discovered not only our camera was missing, my husband\u2019s medications, the extra camera battery, a $100 dollar gift certificate that was in the pocket of my husbands vest and a small knife were missing. We immediately called security that took an incident report. We had to contact the police on our own. That day was spent in the repair shop for our motorcycle, what a way to spend a vacation day! We are very disappointed in the lack of urgency with the security team; the motorcycles were not treated as priority. In all the years we have been visiting this resort during Biketoberfest and Bike Week, motorcycles have been secured in the lower levels, this year it was find your own space. After the break ins, the police drove about Tuesday & Wednesday, but bikes were never remanded to the lower levels. We complained about the lack of security precautions for our motorcycles to no avail. Motorcycles are more vulnerable to vandalism, and many twice the cost of a vehicle. On Wednesday my husband notice that a paper towel had been stuck into the door jam of our room, we did not alert security due to the lack of interest of our plight. We had been dismissed. Now during this whole week we had been finding Pizza flyers from the Pizzeria across the street, two or three a day. The day we got burglarized our neighbor had a flyer pushed half way under their door. I noticed it as we did not have one. During the week, flyers were everywhere, this was odd to me as, we were told we could order pizza but they are not allowed to deliver to the rooms, pizza had to be picked up in the lobby. So why all the flyers? The answer was easy, yesterday afternoon 10-17-09, my husband was walking down the hall to our room, and observed two young men with backpacks, flyers, pushing on doors as they walked. My husband called to them, asked them who they worked for, that they were not supposed to be here and they quickly left. As my husband turned into our hall he saw our neighbor\u2019s door was standing open. My husband must have interrupted them. My husband knocked on the neighbor\u2019s door to alert them (they were in the bathroom!), he explained we had been robbed; now we know how. My husband alerted security, and the comment was this \u2018just doesn\u2019t happen\u2019 there was absolutely no interest! My husband went across the street and spoke with the manager regarding their staff handing out flyers. The manager stated they do not have staff or hire anyone to hand out flyers. Still resort security was uninterested. We will never feel safe at the Wyndham again and are extremely disappointed at the lack of security at this resort.

We were told it wasn't a problem the 1st space would be complimentary and the 2nd space was $10. What we didn't find out until we arrived was that only 1 of the 2 would be in the Wyndam Parking Garage. The 2nd space was across the street in the public parking garage. Not a huge deal, but a little aggravating when we all left to go somewhere. Then there was the luggage carts... if you want one, be prepared to give the attendant at the carts your driver's license. You won't get a cart unless you do. Again, not a big deal, but not too crazy about having to leave the license to get a cart. And finally, we did not know that they didn't have housekeeping come in unless you call and request (not a big deal though, I prefer people not running in and out of my room unless I'm there anyway). But we did find out after asking about getting additional clean towels that we had to wash the ones we had.(there was a stackable W/D in the suite). Again, not too big of a deal, but just wasn't informed. Pools could have used a vaccuum a little more but not bad. Overall it was a great place. Not complaining about these things just informing you of things we did not know at first. I did love the place. It was very well kept, staff was friendly, on site store and eating options.

This was my first time to Daytona Beach and an easy 20 years since I had a \u201creal\u201d getaway vacation. My girlfriend and I started off having a great time until our UPSCALE RESORT ROOM WAS BURGLARIZED. I would like to share my experience with you so you can make your own decision as to whether or not you want to risk having a similar experience yourself at this resort. We arrived at the Wyndham Ocean Walk Resort on September 1, 2009, around 4:00pm. We had no trouble checking in as some people have stated, however, it was only a Tuesday. We then began our vacation by enjoying the resort facilities, the beach, many local establishments, sightseeing, and of course the Daytona 500 Speedway Experience Tour\u2026this was a BIG highlight of my vacation. So far I had taken about 500 pictures during the first 48 hours of our trip. On Thursday, September 3, 2009, we enjoyed a great meal and perfect service at the Outback Steakhouse. We returned to our room, #1406, around 8:30pm\u2026. Keep in mind we were only gone for about 2 hours! Upon entering our room, I noticed the bathroom light was on (I turned \u201ceverything\u201d off when we left). As I entered the bedroom I soon discovered my camera bag and equipment were missing (value of contents $2400.00)\u2026.. I further searched our room and noticed the balcony door looked slightly open\u2026 I grabbed the door and it opened right up. The lock was in the locked position, but due to a malfunctioning door, it did not catch the hook inside the door jam and allowed the door to be opened from the outside. Also stolen were prescription medication, cash, and our dresser drawers were gone through. The rooms on either side of us were not in use, so how could someone possibly enter a balcony door on the 14th floor? I immediately contacted the resort manager, security, and the Daytona Beach PD. A lock interrogation (which electronically reads all recorded entries through only the main door of the room) was performed by resort security. The results showed no entry through our front door #1406, no entry through door #1407 on our right, and a recorded 2:00pm entry into room #1405 on our left. This entry was determined to be made by a member of the resort maintenance department who entered room #1405 at 2:00pm to work on \u201clighting\u201d. The balcony design at this resort allows an individual to hop over a waist high railing from one balcony to another between certain groups of rooms. These rooms are all connected by a common balcony and are able to be accessed by hopping over the railing. I was told by management that the security guards watch the balconies for such activities. It seems this is a common problem here. Can you imagine what your neck would feel like looking up at balconies all the time? I observed security guards being nothing more than outdoor pool monitors; socializing, reprimanding kids running in the pool area, opening the gate for guests who did not carry their key card, and watching that no guest leaves their personal belongings at a pool chair for more than 30 minutes while swimming. If you do, they will take your stuff. How can you concentrate on effectively watching balconies when you are doing this other nonsense? My opinion is maybe there\u2019s something more going on behind the scenes here. The D.B.P.D. took fingerprints and DNA samples for the record. I requested a viewing of resort security tapes and was told; no manpower (I volunteered), no time (I offered my time), no cameras on the floors or by the elevators, and the cameras they do have allegedly are not located anywhere to be of value in this situation, unless someone just happens to walk by one of them. Apparently the current security system at this resort is useless when you need it most; it is better suited to protect a thief instead of the guests. My experience with management regarding this incident continues as pathetic and very unprofessional. I felt they were very insensitive to our situation. In the 36 hours after our loss, NO ONE from the resort even had the compassion to check on us. They filled out paperwork as routine and conducted no creditable search for our stolen property. At my request, the adjoining rooms were opened and searched for a possible suspect in hiding. I was later somewhat comforted by the insinuation that their insurance would cover our loss, this turned into A BIG JOKE!! We were nothing but pacified in order to keep everything quiet from the other guests. The shift manager slipped the insurance claim paperwork through our door sometime the next night (Friday), not even the common courtesy to meet with us in a professional manner face to face. I told her she could call me at \u201cany time\u201d, she never did. We checked out on Saturday, September 5, 2009, nothing ever felt so good!!! Upon returning home, I contacted their insurance provider and was assigned an \u201cAdjuster\u201d. After my claim was filed, I got nothing but a runaround. My calls to the adjuster went unanswered and were rarely returned, my emails were not replied to, and questions about my claim were avoided. After the insurance adjuster concluded his investigation, I was told the resort felt they were not liable for our loss and therefore it will not be covered. Well, what is the purpose of insurance? I also spoke with Wyndham Corporate executives who refused to accept liability which would have allowed payment for my loss. My loss is a drop in the bucket compared to what they make through their corporate greed. It seems to me that Wyndham calls the shots for the insurance provider and the guest only gets screwed. We are also supposed to get a refund for our room; I will believe that only if it happens. Even if it does, I am still out almost $2500.00 from a resort who could care less about its guests. In order to possibly locate this camera and track down the thief, I am providing a description of only the stolen items which are identified by a serial number. Please circulate this information in an attempt to locate this stolen equipment. If anyone should identify this equipment, please contact the Daytona Beach Police at 386-671-5100.

The other reviews about the cleanliness is right, the pools aren't the cleanest but just imagine a ton of people getting into the pools from 8am to 12 am, the pools are going to have everything in them, and I completely understand.There was a lazy river, which wasn't that lazy because kids don't understand, but it is ok, I enjoyed it regardless. I liked that there was security almost everywhere which made things safe and under control. There was a poolside bar with food which was great, a indoor bar that opened at 5 pm until about midnight or so, and a little store that sold everything that you may need and also served various foods such as burgers, pizza, sandwiches, etc. The service overall was excellent, the front desk helped us out all the way, and helped us check in pretty early because we switched rooms because of timeshare issues and everything, and it was nothing to do with the hotel. Everything we requested was brought up very promptly and maintenance had to fix our stove, which was fixed in less than 45 minutes. The good amount of pools was excellent, and the hotel also offered things to do for kids, and had a arcade with a decent amount of games, board games for rent, movies for rent (although i would not recommend the movies because they are way overpriced), an \"adult\" room where guest over the age of 21 could watch tv, surf the net on the hotel's computers or can get on the hotel's WIFI (which is offered in the lobby and a few other places in the hotel, and one of my primary complaints is that WIFI is not offered everywhere throughout the hotel, but it is ok), and play some pool. There was also a fitness center that was very large with free weights, machine weights, and other fitness machines. The hotel also had a direct walkway to the Ocean Walk Shoppes which has Bubba Gump Shrimp Co., Starbucks, Quiznos, and plenty more of other really good shops, and a band shell where various bands perform. Daytona Beach offers the beach for driving access, but luckily the hotel has reserved the stretch of beach in front of their hotel for non-driving access for everything that is not a service vehicle or a vendor (which one was on the beach everyday that offered sandwiches, burgers, hot dogs, ice cream, cold drinks, etc), and the hotel places a security guard at a gate right off the beach monitoring those that go in and out to and from the beach, which i found very good, and there are a few key access points where guests can access the hotel at a lots of different points of entry into the hotel with their room key card. The rooms were very nice, not the cleanest i have ever seen, but definitely manageable. PLEASE READ: ALL THOUGH THE HOTEL OFFERS OCEAN FRONT, OCEANVIEW, AND STREET VIEW ROOMS, THEY ALSO OFFER ROOMS THAT DO NOT HAVE EITHER OF THESE VIEWS, BUT DO VIEW A HALLWAY, which was awkward when we had to move into one of those rooms, but we were hardly in the room anyway. The rooms had nice bathrooms, enough of a kitchen to create a meal, and the room was very cozy overall. I am complaining like the rest of everyone on here, they do not give enough towels in the room. But the hotel does give each guest in the room a large beach towel which is very nice, but when not returned, will cost you $15 each. There were two towers, North and South, the South being the older one and each had a parking deck, where the spots were kind of small. Each tower had elevators that moved very fast, which people were complaining about the waiting times, but there are so many guest at one time, I now know why they take a long time. The hotel had a the bar at night, and also offered different activities throughout the hotel for teens, kids, and adults, things such as hula hoop contest, limbo contest, karaoke, dancing, and more. But those activities may not be offered for too much long, it being the end of the summer. I overall loved the hotel, everything about it, the small little quirks are easily ignorable, and I look forward to going back sometime in the future.

This allowed us to find a chair when we needed it. We were disappointed at the lack of a sit-down restaurant on property, but there were a few places to eat within walking distance.

Upon driving 15 hours and checking in, I had to wait for over an hour and a half to catch an elevator from the parking garage to our floor. That was ridiculous. 2. The pool policy of confiscating all our stuff after 30 minutes is horrible. I was swimming with two children and we decided to get out of the pool. We got to our chair only to discover all our stuff was missing. It took me 15 minutes of searching out \"security\" guards to find out that they threw it all in a trash bag. This is a horrible, horrible policy for a \"family\" resort. Do you really expect people to just lay out and sunbathe and not get in the pools without constantly running back to security and \"checking in\" to make sure all their stuff doesn't vanish. It's a damn good thing I didn't have my wallet, cell phone or any valuables with me that day. 3. The utensils in the room were sub-par. We had to make due with a pizza cutter that was broken. The only pot in the room held about 2 cups of water and there were no baking pans at all. I have stayed at many different resorts through time share trades and this one was the worst stocked kitchen I have ever seen and it wasn't even close. 4. The door on the second bedroom of the unit we had wouldn't even close because of swelling or it was improperly hung. 5. The shower in the main bedroom wasn't very clean upon check in. It wasn't filthy, but it also looked like it hadn't be truly cleaned in a few weeks. 6. The pool area was roped off every morning for cleaning. We walked on the beach to see the sunrise one morning and security wouldn't let us walk through the pool area to access the beach. We had to walk through the resort down to the South exit to get to the beach. For a resort that is \"on the beach\" that is another horrible policy. 7. No fewer than 3 times did the fire alarm go off during the week. I felt like I was a freshman in college again living in a crappy dorm. All in all, we were quite disappointed with our week but made the most of it. Actually the expression \"that's Wyndham for you\" became sort of a running joke with us as the week progressed. I can not and will not recommend this resort to anyone.", "Date": "August 14, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lancaster, PA", "Title": "\u201cWill definitely go back again!\u201d", "Author": "kewldog4", "ReviewID": "UR37461711", "Content": "We arrived at 5 pm on a Sunday and the lobby was packed!

My husband was attending a conference and we took along our 13 year old daughter and her friend. At previous conferences in Daytona we had stayed at the Hilton (was Adams Mark) next door, but we wanted 2 bedrooms and OceanWalk was a better deal. Just before we left I decided to check TripAdvisor and was dismayed at so many negative comments on OceanWalk. Our experience was positive so I feel compelled to give the negative reviews some balance. I'm going to write this as I go and give a lot of detail because I had so many questions about OW that I wish had been addressed in some of the other reviews. It will be long, but I hope it will be of use to others. First, let me say that I am from Florida and would not choose Daytona as a place to vacation. I think there are other better beaches in Florida and the whole Daytona scene, shops, etc. isn't really my cup of tea. But if you go there and if you stay at OW here's my 2 cents. This resort is huge, and it has many time-share places within it, so the different units may be in different states of repair or comfort, I guess. Our suite was simply excellent. We got a 2 bedroom, 2 bath on the 23rd floor of the North Tower (25 stories high). I was disappointed when my husband said that they didn't have any oceanfront available, but when I saw our place I was very happy. We were put in a corner unit, with a wraparound balcony so the view is of the river and the town to the west and to the south you can see miles of beach and the Atlantic Ocean stretching out. At night the lights are magical and with the 3 sliding glass doors we have a great view from inside to the south and west at the same time. Another unexpected advantage of this location was that we can see the sunset. After looking up at the ones on the beach side I decided that I liked our side better since we had a panoramic view and such a large balcony. The balconies on the ocean side are much smaller. Info on the unit, #2333, cost $199 per night reserved through calling OW, not through a private or timeshare situation. We perhaps could have gotten a better price, but after seeing our unit I thought this was a reasonable price for it. Also, staying in 2 rooms at the Hilton, even with the conference discount, would have been more than this so we were satisfied. Unit seems freshly painted in tropical colors. The furniture is of good quality and the upholstery is not worn at all. Everything is very clean. Drapes and carpet look new. The bedspreads seem a little worn, but not bad. The master bedroom mattress was firm but comfortable. The girls said the same about the double beds. The sheets are of decent quality, not high end, but not thin or scratchy. 3 good pillows on the master bed. There are 3 TVs in the unit, one for each BR and one in the living room. Lots of nice lamps--Master BR has a lamp on each side of the bed, but the room with 2 double beds only has one on the table between the beds. There is an alarm clock in the both bedrooms. There is an iron and full sized ironing board. Master bathroom has a shower and a jacuzzi tub. Very spacious. They give you bar soap and a few little bottles of shampoo, etc. but the shampoo wouldn't last long. There were handtowels, washcloths and 4 bath towels in the master bathroom and 4 in the other bathroom, so not having enough towels was not an issue. Only weird thing in the master bath is that there is only one hook to hang towels...no bars or rings. There is a hair dryer both bathrooms. The living room has a 30\" TV, not flat screen or high definition, but fine. There are numerous cable channels, a DVD and VCR player. Also a boom box type thing for music. We did not use this. The dining room has a long table that seats 6 with very sturdy and comfortable chairs. A bonus was that I was able to get an unlocked wireless connection from the living room and the master bedroom. The signal was low inside, but on the balcony the signal was usually great. There is a computer room in OW and I saw people using laptops sitting in the comfortable chairs in the lobby, so even if you didn't luck into this free wireless you can access it elsewhere. The kitchen is large and equipped with all the basic stuff. Because I was concerned about what to bring I will give some detail here about what was in our kitchen: Counter appliances were--Toaster, Blender, Coffeemaker (no filters provided). There is a large microwave above the electric stove, which is full sized and has a full sized oven. The fridge is medium sized, has a ice maker--I think this was turned off when we arrived, but I fooled around with the button and it works fine. They have a couple of cutting boards, full set of forks, spoons, knives, plus steak knives and some long knives. Probably would be a good idea to bring a good quality knife or two if you plan to cook. There is a large pot (size you would boil water for spaghetti), plus a small pan and a fry pan. These pans are of good quality. Provided are plates, bowls, cups, glasses, wine glasses. Also, colander, paper towel roll, measuring cups, grater, large serving/mixing spoons, spatula, can opener and corkscrew. There are several mixing bowls. No potholders. No plastic ware for using as foodsavers, except for one medium sized plastic bowl that has a top; no plastic wrap or foil. There is a dishwasher and a starter supply of DW detergent in little packs. There is a garbage disposal. The trash can has a plastic bag in it and there is a spare hung on the side of the trash can and a few more under the sink. There is no drain rack to put your dishes in if you hand wash them. There are several dishrags supplied and a new scrubbie (no sponge) and a couple of dish towels. No liquid dish soap is provided. Bottom line--we didn't do a lot of cooking, but I wish I had brought a good cutting knife, a few plastic containers and a small bottle of liquid dishsoap. Stacked washer and dryer are in a closet. They give you a few starter packages of detergent, but you should consider bringing your own bottle if you think you will be doing laundry. The washer and dryer are small so can't do very big loads and the dryer is loud, but this wasn't that big of a problem to me. Resort activities and comments on the general place: Others complained about how crowded everything was, problems with elevators, etc. No complaints from us. Our stay in August is definitely low season so that should be factored in. We had no problems checking in, no problems with the elevators. There are only 4, but they came reasonably quickly and though you did have to stop at a lot of floors sometimes, anyone who has ever ridden elevators in tall buildings just accepts this. The people staying here are not the dregs of society as depicted by one reviewer. There are lots of normal middle class families, lots of happy sunburned kids; a variety of people, but perfectly nice to associate with! After touring around the place with the girls I felt fine to let them go off on their own as long as they stayed together. Kids are allowed at the pool without adult supervision if they are older than 12. There are lots of security officers wandering around wearing gray uniforms. Game room for kids has arcade games; give them a lot of quarters if they are going to spend any time here. There is a small pool table in there, too. There is also a game room for adults next door with 2 pool tables, cost $1 per game. There are 3 computers in the adult game room. The computer room is next to these and they have a few more computers that you can sign up to use. I saw people in there with laptops. The indoor mini golf isn't much but could be something to do on a rainy day and it doesn't cost anything to play. It is in a big room on the 4th floor. There are 4 different outside pool areas and you are supposed to wear your wristband in this area. At 10:30 am all the chairs at all the pools were taken but later in the afternoon, around 3 pm there were free chairs. The pool area did always seem kind of crowded. We preferred hanging out at the beach so we didn't make use of the pools. There is a kiddie pool which is shallow and has a fence around it and has little things to climb on, etc. This is a small area, but would be nice if you had a toddler. There is the \"lazy river\" pool which doesn't seem like much to me..you sit in a tube and go around an island. There were always people in it, though. You have to use their tubes which I guess could be hard to get sometimes, but there were several sitting on the side at 10:30 am. I saw a group of girls participating in a hula hoop contest with some resort personnel. Another pool has a volleyball net set up and the 4th pool is big and has a decent sized slide that corkscrews around, which seems like fun for kids. There is access to the beach from the pool area and this is monitored by a resort guy who isn't supposed to let you back in that gate unless you have the wristband, but I never saw him stop anyone and I came and went without a wristband many times. You can get beach towels from the resort for your stay, and if you don't turn it back in at the end they charge you $15 per towel. We were allotted 8 towels over our 3 night stay that we could get at any time, so one day we got 3 and could get the other ones whenever. There are 2 indoor pools, one in the North and one in the South Tower. The one in the North Tower is BY FAR the nicer one, so if you are staying in the South Tower & want to use an indoor pool go over to the North Tower one. The gym has 4 new treadmills and good looking bikes and at least one elliptical. Otherwise the equipment and machines are old and the place isn't that nice. The free weights didn't include light weights that women typically use (3 lb and 5 lb) that I could see; there are towels available there. I used the treadmill and a couple of the machines, but didn't enjoy the workout much. There is nowhere to be on the floor to do situps, etc. All felt kind of grungy. Make use of the concierge if you want to do any activities in the area. Our girls wanted to go to the Daytona Lagoon waterpark which is across the street. The cost is $20 for people over 4 ft. tall if you buy your ticket from the hotel concierge, and $29 if you buy at the waterpark. People under 4 ft. tall cost $17 at the hotel. The girls had fun and they went by themselves and spent about 3 hours there. They stamp your hand so you can re-enter but when my daughter used soap to wash her hands the stamp came off. They didn't want to go back anyway but that might have been a problem. Restaurant comments-General Daytona Beach area--we didn't eat at any restaurant in the OW resort: Pantheon Pizza for great pizza, very good price. We got a large 16 in. 3 topping plus a small greek salad (salad wasn't too good) and one imported bottled beer and the check was $20 not including tip. We took pizza home. Also people at the next table over had hamburgers and my husband said, \" I don't eat hamburgers, but if I did I'd come here.\" Very, very casual. No ambience, wear whatever you have on. You have to drive over the bridge to get to it, but drive is only about 15 min. Edamame Japanese Restaurant--just happened on this place after we bailed out on Bubba Gumps because it was so crowded and chaotic and the wait time was too long. We drove over the bridge looking for some local place and found this place in a strip shopping center near Outback. We had the hibachi meals and it was great fun to watch the cooking performance and great food. They also serve sushi, regular Japanese food, etc. Beer and wine very reasonable prices. Huge portions. Everyone took home leftovers. The hibachi meals come with soup, salad, shrimp appetizer, fried rice, noodles, whatever meat you choose. There was a veggie option that only cost $10.95 for all of it. Very fresh vegetables and delicious. We loved the people in this place too. Friendly and attentive. Nice decor, but not fancy. Bubba Gumps--right next to the OW so easy walk. We peeked in and checked it out midday and thought it looked like fun. Looks like a good place to take kids, but when dinner time came it was mobbed. I would give it a try another time, but earlier in the day. The Cellar--Italian restaurant just over the bridge and a little south of Int'l Speedway Blvd. Has an extensive wine list. Excellent italian food, the homemade pasta was the best thing we got. My husband got the snapper special which wasn't all that special, but the girls got the \"alla checca\" rigatoni with sauce and it was exceptional. I got seafood risotto. Two fabulous desserts to share. Would recommend this place for a special night out, a little expensive compared to other places we ate, but the food was really good. The concierge can make reservations for you. Bottom line on our stay--OceanWalk is a family oriented place and don't expect otherwise. I'm sure that at times it is more crowded and that would likely make it less appealing, but our August stay was just fine.", "Date": "August 8, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "NJ", "Title": "\u201cFabulous Vacation\u201d", "Author": "Brooked30", "ReviewID": "UR36854649", "Content": "My husband, young son (4) and extended family got back Monday from a week stay at the Ocean Walk.

We had a washer and dryer, as well as a full kitchen. While it is true that there were not many towels, doing laundry was no trouble at all. You could start it in the morning when you got up, throw stuff in the dryer, and have it be done when you got back from the beach. The pools were great, and the beach was lovely. We brought our own beach towels from home, and bought a cheap umbrella for 20 bucks. The food poolside was a tad expensive (9 bucks for a burger and fries) but hey, thats hotel food for you. I really enjoyed the activites the hotel had during our stay. We went to karaoke 3 times, water aerobics 2x, and hip hop aerobics! They also had a pirate and princess party that my 5 yr old niece enjoyed, and a hoola hoop contest my 9 yr old niece competed in. My son has autism and had a great time with the pools and the ocean, which was a great relief to us. Our hotel room never felt crowded. I do agree that the elevator situation is a complete joke. We stayed in the North Tower, which had 25 floors. One bank of elevators (4 total) is not nearly enough. I also don't understand why there isn't hotel wide wi-fi.

I rented a one-bedroom condo at the Ocean Walk from Daytona Ocean Rentals (DBA Cindy Grutza). The room was filthy! The bed linens were stained (both the set of linens on the bed and the back-up set) and the blanket had cigarette burns in it, even though the room was supposed to be non-smoking. The night stand and kitchen table both had sticky soda stains all over their surfaces. And the last renter's toiletries were still in the bathroom (someone's used razors, dirty hair brush. old Ziploc bags and tampon wrappers are not my idea of cleanliness). It was a complete nightmare. To top it all off, the view from the balcony had been deliberately misrepresented. It looks as though Daytona Ocean Rentals took a picture of the view from a few floors above this condo and cropped the photo so you don't realize until you arrive that your view is 100% obstructed. Yes -- the entire hotel is between your room and the ocean. And with wall-to-wall windows along each internal hallway, all 20-something floors can see you while you try to relax on your balcony. I work in marketing; I know exactly how and why the picture was cropped like it was. To make matters even worse, Daytona Ocean Rentals overcharged me $560! They promised to refund the unused portion of our stay because of these problems (which is the only reason we checked out early; otherwise we would have purchased our own sheets and stuck it out). But when I got home from vacation later in the week, I received a handwritten note (oh yeah, she's that professional) saying she had changed her mind and would not be refunding our money. I have never in my entire life had a hotel or a merchant rip me off. It is the most frustrating experience I have ever had and I would never want another person to have to endure this. In an economy like this where people are struggling, I find it disgusting that there are hotels and rental companies who are trying to take advantage of people to make an extra buck.

It was our first visit here. The resort is comfortable and clean and we found several things to like about it. There is a nice bar and restaurant inside of the resort. Additionally, there is a shopping, restaurant, and move theater complex (Ocean Walk Shoppes) next door to the resort where there are several great places to eat, including Cold Stone Creamery and Johnny Rockets. You are able to get to the Ocean Walk Shoppes directly from the resort; there is a connecting hallway which we found very convenient. We found the resort staff friendly and helpful. Halfway through our stay our room key card stopped working and the staff apologized and immediately replaced it. The staff was also very helpful in answering any questions we had. We felt very safe at the resort, too. Your room key is required to get into the parking lot and pool area (if you are coming from outside). I noticed there were always several security guards at the resort at all times, including one at the front entrance and one in the back pool area. There is a gift store, small convenience store/grocery store, adult lounge (consisting of a pool table and a few computers), computer room, arcade, kid\u2019s craft area, and miniature golf area in the resort. The resort is within walking distance of many eateries and gift shops and within driving distance of several pharmacies and grocery stores, including Publix, Winn-Dixie, and Walgreens. There is a gate the leads from the pool area to the ocean, which is also very convenient. The resort appears to be kept up well. The outer appearance is very nice and looks much better than many of the other hotels in the area. The unit we stayed in was very clean and all of the furniture was comfortable. There was a washer and dryer in the unit, which was very convenient. I would suggest bringing your own laundry detergent or buying it somewhere other than the resort, though. You are given a small amount of laundry detergent initially, but even with just my husband and I, we quickly went through this. The laundry detergent sold at the resort was overpriced. As much as we enjoyed our stay, there were a few things we were not entirely happy with. Using the internet is very difficult at the resort. The wi-fi signal is only in the lobby area and the signal was very weak, though we tried moving to several different spots in the lobby. There is a computer lab in the basement, but there were only a handful of computers and they were always occupied. The resort has an outdoor bar by the pool, but it closed very early in the evening. We were also disappointed in the activities the resort offered. The week we visited had very bad weather. There were several severe thunderstorms and an unusually large amount of rain that made outdoor activities impossible most of the week. There were a couple of days during our week-long stay that it rained nonstop from the moment we woke up in the morning to the moment we went back to bed that night. The resort staff called our room on those days with a message I assumed went to all rooms at once. The message always began by stating it was a \u201cLiquid Sunshine Day\u201d and the resort had planned activities to keep guest entertained. The activities were very disappointing, though! The resort showed movies on these days, but they were always movies that have been released for a very long time, such as Disney\u2019s Monster\u2019s, Inc. (Monsters, Inc. was actually shown on two different days during our stay, so it seems the resort has a very limited movie collection to chose from!) Bingo and karaoke were also offered on a couple of different days, but this was it as far as activities for adults went. I cannot comment on the activities offered for kids, though I think there was a daily craft offered for children. The resort does have movies for rent for viewing in your own room, but their movie collection is very outdated and I only saw VHS tapes for rent. The resort has several outdoor and indoor pools and two outdoor hot tubs. However, there were not hot tubs accompanying the indoor pools, which I found strange (usually if there is an indoor pool there is an indoor hot tub). The two outdoor hot tubs did not seem big enough to accommodate a resort this size. On the few days it didn\u2019t rain, we had trouble finding a time when the hot tubs were not too full for us to use. Overall, I would recommend staying at this resort, as it looked to be one of the nicer ones at Daytona Beach. I would suggest that anyone staying has a back-up plan for what they will do if it rains several days in a row during their visit, as the resort doesn\u2019t offer enough to keep you occupied if you can\u2019t go outside.", "Date": "July 26, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cleveland", "Title": "\u201cBeware of Promises Made By Wyndham\u201d", "Author": "rastajeff23", "ReviewID": "UR35306360", "Content": "As a VIP owner of Wyndham Timeshare points, I have had mostly good things to say about different Wydham properties.

Ours had a lovely view of the hallway too, which we were told it had a riverview, but I guess it did if you opened your blinds and looked through the hall out the back of the place. But who wants to open their windows into a hallway where everyone can look in your room as they pass??? There were no overhead lights either. All you had were lamps so it looked like a dungeon. Also, the first night we were there, the air conditioners on the entire 13th floor were out. We called repeatedly to the front desk and all we were told is we were on a waiting list. I finally asked to speak to a manager and she said there was nothing they could do. Meanwhile, my 4 year old daughter was pouring in sweat in her sleep in our 1304B dungeon. The front desk staff were rude and acted as if they couldn't care less! So I waited out in the hallway for the \"engineer\" and my mother camped out in the lobby along with other guests from our floor until they finally did something about it. Also, the water in the B unit never would get hot. The dryer in the A unit would run continuously all night even unless you stopped it. Elevators at this place are a nightmare. Especially in the afternoon thunderstorm time. We waited up to 40 minutes one time just to get on an elevator. Also, in the lazy river, be sure you get a hold of one of their 15 round floats or else the nazi staff will boot you out. They insist you have one of their floats in the lazy river, yet they only have a handful of them. So you spend a great deal of time standing at the steps waiting on someone to feel guilty enough to get off and give you a turn with one. Crazy! They don't allow anyone on the water slide until around 10:30 or 11:00 and they shut it back down around 5 or 6. Ridiculous! Room keys rarely if ever worked when trying to get back into the resort from the Ocean Walk Shoppe area. Had to stand there and wait until someone happened to walk by to let you in.

Unit 2222AB is actually 2 one bedroom units that have a door in the middle that connect the 2 into a Two bedroom unit. I appreciated the coffee s& filters stocked for us in the room so we could have coffee on our first morning before we went grocery shoppping. The unit was stocked with adequate dishes and pots and pans making meal prep convenient. The King Bed in the master bedroom was VERY comfortable. Definately a high quality mattress. The 2 double mattresses in the other bedroom was worn and one even sagged in the middle. THe towels were also high quality. THe condo contained shampoo, soap, dish detergent, bath foam. The resort DOES NOT have ice machines. Be sure to turn ON your ice machine in the condo freezers if you want ice. The resort does have a lot of activities for all ages. Women be sure to take advantage of their $5 Spa package on Tuesday at 1:30. It is quit the bargain for the price. It is actually a beauty control consultant promoting their spa products but you get to try a lot of stuff and it is in a very spa like environment. For $5 you get a warm neck wrap, instant manicure, facial, dark circle/eye treatment, foot treatments and seveal other pampering items. It is very well worth your $5 and a 80 minutes of pleasant treatment. I would recommend this unit to anyone, while it could stand some DEEP cleaning, it was suitable. My sons LOVED the wireless internet connection in the rooms. If you rent from the hotel and NOT from a private owner like Carmen & Dennis, you will NOT get the inroom free internet. Renting from this private couple was easy and they are very professional and pleasant.

The resorts pools are great, include a waterslide and small waterfall, which the kids loved. Also, a lazy river, which was a little small, but that didn't matter to the kids. There was also a kiddie play area with 1 foot deep water. When it gets a little cold or too windy outside, there are also 2 indoor pools. There is a bar out by the pools where you can also get food. Or just pop right next door to the Ocean Walk shoppes for a large variety (Bubba Gump's is recommended, and I don't eat seafood!). You walk out the back of the resorts past the pool, out the gate (you need your room key to get back in) and poof, you are on the beach! This was the best part of being at the resort - plus it's in a no-vehicle-on-the-beach area. There are also beach vendors selling food and drink (cheaper than the pool bar). We did have a few problems with the room - hole in the wall, no towels, missing doorknob on guest BR door, shower door off track in Master BR, wet carpet, broken toaster, and, our favorite, a pair of kid's underwear from the previous guests found in the living room! They did resolve all the items we reported on the first day (toaster and underwear happened later in the week, and we just didn't want to bother). Activities center was very nice - went for an ice cream social and to paint ceramics. Reasonably priced. No internet access in the room itself. Wireless was available down in the business center. They also had computers there that you could use. Also access to a printer to be able to print boarding passes. Beware of the hair weave people at the resort. They charge $2 per inch for the hair wrap. She wrapped at least 2 inches longer than my niece's hair, and it started to come undone where it wasn't wrapped around the hair. She did fix it that same day, but the wrap should have been 2 inches shorter (and $4 cheaper) in the first place. Shopping - there is a souvenir shop called Oceanic Gifts on N. Atlantic, 2 shops north of Main St. Prices here were very reasonable, good selection, friendly staff. The one that's across the street from the resort (I don't remember the name), I would not recommend. They do the iron-on designs, and after 1 washing, the decal on one of the two shirts purchased already started to come off. They were also kind of pushy.

Due to staying midweek to midweek we had two reservations and had to change rooms. The first part of the stay was a two bedroom ocean front. We loved it. It wasn't the pretty blue decor with dark kitchen cabinets in the pictures(must be in the penthouse), but it was very nice. We especially liked there were two patio doors with a double balcony. Seemed odd that none of the windows opened so people not in the master couldn't hear the surf. The second part of the week was less satisfying. We had a 3 bedroom/2 bath. We assumed if the 2 br was nice and large the 3 br would be more so. NOT!!! I think the square footage was the same everything was just smaller to squeeze in the extra bedroom. There was still only seating for 4 in the living room and the dining area was much smaller. The worst part was two bedrooms had windows to the hall. You had to have the blinds closed all the time so people couldn't see right in and light was a problem at night. Again no windows opened so the only way to get fresh air was through the balcony door. The deck was only a single deck rather than the double for the 2 br. Unless you absolutely have to have the extra bedroom book the 2 br.

We really liked the Maui Nix Surf Shop with some great swim suits and gifts. Bubba Gumps Shrimp was just OK but had a fun atmosphere. There are other shops, ice cream stands, restaurants etc. in the complex and behind this area there is a bandshell. The first time we were there there was a car show in the bandshell (not really our thing)....but the second time there was some type of local band playing -- SUPER fun, dancing, singing, drinking.

We stayed in a two-bedroom lockoff, and it was fantastic! As soon as we arrived, the staff greeted us warmly and offered us a welcome packet.

We had friends who were generous enough to let us buy a week of time, points, or whatever you call it in a time share system. We were very impressed with the place. CONS: Everywhere you turn you are propositioned to attend tiimeshare sales pitches. Depending on your position you may want to consider it. We were offered $80 in dinner funds. We weren't buying, shopped at the local Publix grocery store (excellent!), and didn't want to spend the time, so we declined. Our room, though v ery nice, was in an interior hallway which was really weird because the only two windows (living area and bedroom) in the place overlooked an interior hallway, which meant anyone walking past could look at you like a zoo exhibit. The draw shades were light-proof, and we kept them down the entirety of our stay. We had no natural light when we were in the room. The view from the hallway was of the Halifax river and what we though may be downtown Daytona. Nice view, but it was a weird environment, as such. If you can do so, book an oceanfront room. The couch bed in our room was really filthy from food stains. We covered it with the extra blanket and sheets in the room in order to sit on it.. We reported this to the hotel. The sign on the outside hot tub says something like \"children under 12 are permitted with supervision.\" Supervision for some parents is if you are within one-quarter mile. We thought there should be a ban on children in the hot tub altogether. We left twice because of the little rugrats (we raised ours, and don't care to have to watch those of strangers). The resort apparently does not recycle. We're not tree huggers, but we have recycled for years, and I cringed every time I had to put glass and plastics with the rest of the trash into the trash chute. But hey, that's just me The weekend we were there, there was a large adolescent youth group staying there. They held the elevators open, which were usually not a problem as far as waiting, were shreiking in only the pitch that adolescent girls can achieve, took over the pool/hot tub area in the evening, and pretty much stole one night of relaxation from us. This was a disappointment that the resort would rent to such a gaggle of hormonal youth, but they did. We didn't see an adult with these kids. We were glad to hear so many other guests express their dismay with this group, as we thought we may be the only ones. Even the lobby/bar area wasn't exempt from the noise of this group. It took an evening from us. We were not happy. PROS: **THE SERVICE IS EXCELLENT** One of the high points I found, was that I was willing to look foolish enough to walk through the interior hall with my laptop computer on and found a wireless internet access about 20 yards from our room, which was a **MAJOR BONUS* * iff you were willing to stand at a window with your computer. I was. Internet access is available in the lobby, but if you want to search for it, you may find it closer to your room. We had a few problems with our room: The TV in the living/sitting area didn't work. Two lamps in sitting area didn't work. We called, and within 90 minutes this was taken care of. Problems may be considered a \"con,\" but the time it took to fix them put them in the \"pro\" category. One evening at 12:30 a.m. we realized our air conditioning quit working. A call to the front desk (they asked if we wanted it now or if we were willing to wait until the morning.... it was Florida, we weren't!) brought a maintenance staffer to our room in less than an hour, and the problem was fixed. We were quite impressed. The fact that the resort issues beach towels is a plus for guests who are flying to this destination, as they are heavy in a suitcase. There is an inside lobby with a bar that offers different theme evenings for those that imbibe, or just like a good time. There was a wine and cheese evening, a martini evening, and a karaoke evening for all you singers. If you enjoying socializing, this is a great venue. There was never a search for beach chairs. There were always unused beach chairs, and tables and chairs. If you're willing to pay the price, there is a restaurant/store in the lobby area that has *great* pizza, and good food, beer and wine available to purchase, along with just about anything else you might need, such as suntan lotions and a smattering of souveniers and clothing. I can't speak for all the beds in all the units, but we had a king size pillow top mattress that compared to our home mattress, which was so very comfortable. Not that we're willing to buy into timeshare, but if we were we wouldn't think twice about this one. Thinking about staying here?

We live in Oregon but we have made this our summer destination usually adding on a few days in Orlando and then going to Daytona to simply relax and enjoy the pools and beach. We booked the resort through our club membership at Worldmark by Wyndham. They \"own\" the rooms on the 11th & 14th floor of this resort. While our trip was again enjoyable, there were some definate disappointments. First, the positive: Resort has the potential of being the best on Daytona Beach. The amazing view from the room, if you have booked ocean front is spectacular. Waking up in time to see the sunrise is breathtaking. We saw dolphins swimming on numerous occasions while we were there. The Hilton puts on a fireworks display every Saturday night which is impressive. Easy access to the beach is a plus not to mention that the section of the beach in front of OW is one of the only stretches of beach in Daytona where cars ar not allowed to drive. The convenience of the Ocean Walk shops within walking distance is great. Nice shops and several good restaurants to choose from. Our kids love to swim and the 5 pools and lazy river are always enjoyable - (will discuss cleanliness of pools later). There are 2 indoor pools which we actually used this time as the weather was not always the best. Two outdoor pools and a small kiddy pool with water falls and a slide. The large slide at the south pool is fun and there is often a fun game of water volleyball going on at the north pool. They also do dive in movies twice a week at dusk. Activities staff are great. Although the activities are reduced from last year, there is still a wonderful schedule of arts and crafts that my two younger children enjoyed. The staff inside in the activities area should also be complimented. They are very friendly and make it a point to get to know the kids by name and make them feel welcome and comfortable. Two days into our stay my 9 year old was greeted by a \"Hi Katie\" \"How are you today Katie?\" whenever she entered the area. While small, the arcade area was a fun spot for my 12 year old to hang out, meet new friends and play pool etc. He also enjoyed the putt-putt gold course on the 4th floor of the North tower. The staff in the inside restaurant as well as the Turtle's Nest bar/grill outside are generally friendly, (has not been the case in years past--esp the indoor cafe) the food selection works for our family--and while a bit expensive, it is nice to have the option of just staying at the pool a few times during your stay and having a quick bite. Indoor cafe offers a variety of items for breakfast, and for lunch pizza, burgers, sandwiches. They now have bags of chips,snacks, ice cream, bottled water and bottled pop available for purchase as well boxed salads and sliced fruit. They have also turned this area into a mini market with detergent, and basic sundries and toiletries. While much more expensive than if you were to go north to the local Publix, it works in a pinch. The outdoor bar also offers food--chicken sandwiches, french fries, burgers, onion rings, my favorite the mahi wrap and also hot dogs. Now for the negative: Resort in general seemed run down and dirty. Carpets especially around elevator areas were very dirty. Carpet just outside our room was filthy with debris and sand--finally just vacuumed it myself. ROOM: Unit 1425 - 3 bedroom Ocean Front The room while clean, was showing definate signs of wear and tear. Huge burn mark on counter where someone had set a hot pan, carpets ripped in corner, furniture stained, screen door leading out to patio broken, windows were filthy. Resort is being re-painted and ours had not been done yet, so maintenance and cleaning was perhaps not a priority, however, the deck was really dirty. Huge stains on the deck floor as well as the walls. Pigeon poop everywhere. Deck furniture was dirty as well. No bedspread on bed in master when we arrived--brought up within 1/2 hour of arrival. Bottom sheet on master bed did not fit--at least 8 inches too short. Had to add another sheet to bottom of bed so that your feet did not rub on the mattress pad or in some areas, the bare mattress. Pillows flat and in desperate need of being replaced. Kitchen not very well stocked. Only 1 very small non-stick frying pan, 1 very small pot and another the size you'd need to feed an army. The oven was not clean and the smoke from it actually set off our smoke detector when we first used it. POOL AREA Although the pool is cleaned every morning from 6:00-8:00 it seems inconsistent as to what they clean and don't clean. Pools are vacuumed, but there is still a good amount of dirt and sand in the bottom when done. I did witness chemicals being checked in all pools. Deck is power washed, but instead of picking up the garbage in their path, some of it gets washed into the pool or surrounding planters. Not all of the deck gets power washed and it seems dirty and smelly in some areas. Garbage in general is a problem. Cigarette butts on stairs leading to elevators and activities area. Garbage and beer cans around the planters at the lazy river. I was shocked at how many people just don't pick up after themselves. Leaving ketchup packets and napkins all around the bar and table areas. There appeared to be one staff member responsible for cleaning these areas during the day and it was too much for her to keep up with. All of the hotubs, but especially the one closest to the North tower seemed really dirty and surrounded by debris. Bathrooms are not the cleanest around pool area and activities area. In years past they would have a DJ playing great music and announcing pool games or announcing when the Turtle's Nest was firing up the grill.etc Helped add to the festivity of a resort atmosphere. They no longer do this and cut it from their budget at the beginning of the year. Really changed the general \"atmosphere\" of the pool area itself, also effected the level of involvement of the pool games as the lifeguards were yelling across the pool deck to get these started instead of a simple announcement by the DJ. The DJ had also previously called out winners of contests and kept the flow of these games going more smoothly. Lifeguards, same ones seem to be there from year to year, do a good job of maintaining order in the lazy river and pool areas, but security, which appears to be outsourced, are inconsistent in what they enforce. Never saw wristbands checked at gate going to and from beach, (the gate was broken - used to require room key to come and go) Security seemed to just wander around pool deck, stepping over trash and not to enforcing much. However, he did come over and reprimand me when my deck chair was 3 inches (literally) over the no deck chairs sign that had been chalked on the pool deck--ok, rules are rules. We were there the week of August 8th. On sunny days the deck chairs are all occupied by 8:30 or 9:00. We have also been in July when I have experienced the \"race\" to get a chair when the pool opens at 8:15. It has become something I just expect--did see belongings being removed on a few occasions when chairs were left unoccupied for over 1/2 hour. Policy on pool towels is disappointing, but necessary. Prior to them enforcing the towel check out policy, towels were left all over the pool deck and in the morning there would be as many as 20-25 that had been left all over the beach. So, typical case of a few irresponsible people ruining it for the rest of us. It would be nice to be able to turn them back in for clean ones. You are allowed to do this once during your stay (if you are staying a week). With three kids I am constantly doing laundry anyway, but the convenience of it would be nice while on vacation. I doubt that the $15.00 per towel is ever enforced---I handed in my armload of 10 towels at the end of our stay without as much as a glance to confirm numbers, she just gave me back my receipt and told me to put them in the bin outside. Yes, the elevators are an issue. Waiting up to 5 minutes was not uncommon. We tried to make the most of it by playing the which one will it be game and at times we took the stairs (which are in desperate need of cleaning!!) Elevators are even more insane when there is a need to close the pool due to weather. Everyone leaves at once and you could wait for 6-8 elevators before finding one with room. TIP: IF you are on the lobby level and have a chance to go down instead of up--take it. It is only one floor down and when it returns back--it will be too full to board. You learn to become comforable getting close to your fellow travelers and SQEEZE in if there is the smallest amount of space. But, it is what it is. Perhaps not the best planning, but we're on vacation RIGHT?? In general the good did still outweigh the bad during this trip. (only slightly) We may have a soft spot for this resort since we have been coming here so long and our kids absolutely love it. However, the problems are a definate concern and have led me to start at least looking for an alternate spot for next summer.", "Date": "August 20, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Florida", "Title": "\u201cSomewhat disappointed\u201d", "Author": "lovemy2kids", "ReviewID": "UR18950421", "Content": "Rooms were clean, staff nice, but pool area was very disappointing.

Only 4 each for the north and south towers. You had to wait on them because they were always full. Extremely poor desigh and planning for the elevators. In addition, the workout facility was okay...

That's the North Tower, South has it's own issues with timeshare sales and access to Boardwalk Shops.When we were there, weather closed not only the pools but the beach as well, and the line for elevators was scary. We walked up 12 floors with pool chairs and cooler rather then wait. Our neighbor told us she waited over 20 minutes to go up! Wyndhym is trying to get a handle on \"guests\" who are not guests using the pool areas which is very nice. This led to some confusion as to what we needed to come back from the beach. You need a room key and a band. Pool chairs are all claimed early by phantom guests who stake out and leave. In the height of the storm, belongings were still left out and were there later in the day. The pool deck itself was not well maintained by guests or hotel personel. Cigarettes stubbed out under chairs and drink cups and garbage was not removed until morning. It made me sad , because it is a beautiful hotel. We had the same problem on our floor. Instead of using the garbage shoot , people would pitch their trash into the room and leave. When I called to complain, personal cleaned up, but it would happen again the next day.

Previous to our trip, I had read negative reviews of this resort but chose to believe that those negative comments were the result of people who expect too much or simply have a need to gripe. After all, most reviews are subjective in nature, plus over our seven years of ownership in Fairfield/Wyndham, we have stayed at several resorts with absolutely no problems. All were great experiences. Maybe our expectations were too high based on our previous experiences with Fairfield/Wyndham. Background: I made reservations in January (7 months ago). Initially, I was informed that they did not have an \"Ocean Front 2 Bedroom Deluxe\" Sunday to Sunday or Saturday to Saturday available, however, they could reserve me a Wednesday to Wednesday stay. Understanding that this isn't the normal procedure for Fairfield/Wyndham because reservations normally go from Friday to Friday, Sat. to Sat. or Sun to Sun, I questioned the guy. He said it was no problem because he would give me two partial week reservations; one for Wed. through Sunday and the other for Sunday through the following Wed. I specifically stated that this was acceptable as long as it was \"Ocean Front, not Ocean View and that our vacation would NOT be disrupted on Sunday by forcing us to pack up and move to another condo. As a family, we had decided that we weren\u2019t concerned with where the beach was located as much as we wanted a beach front balcony so we could enjoy the ocean front view on a daily basis. I was assured that we would have ocean front. I even called back a week or so after making the reservation to get assurance that we wouldn't be moved. Again, I was told everything was fine and that he had added a \"Do Not Move\" note to my reservation. 1) Day 1: Wednesday: Upon arrival, during check-in, the clerk informs me that my confirmation is for four nights (Wed. through Sun. only). I immediately explained the situation to him and after a short computer search, he found my other reservation. This worried me so I questioned him about being moved and whether or not we had an Ocean FRONT balcony. He told me that the rooms had not been assigned for the next week so he couldn't tell me whether or not I was staying in the same room. I later found out this statement was inaccurate. I am told to check back in a day or two. We were pleased to find out that we did have an ocean front balcony and a beautiful view. 2) Elevators are incredibly busy. There just aren't enough elevators for the amount of people in the north tower. One day, my son and I were greeted by two overloaded elevators in a five minute time span and decided to take the stairs. Fortunately, we were only on the sixth floor. It wasn't uncommon to return from the beach to find a line (minimum 10-15 deep) of guests waiting to get on the elevator. 3) Day 2: (Thursday) At 1 PM, all beach towels appear to be gone. We had just spent three nights at Bonnet Creek Resort in Orlando. At Bonnet Creek, guests could freely grab towels from one side of the cabana and return them to a slot on the other side of the cabana. At this time, I wasn\u2019t aware that this resort required that I go into the Sunroom and complete a form to check out towel(s) agreeing to pay $15.00 per towel that isn\u2019t returned. The cabana contained some nicely folded towels but they appeared to be damp. I wasn't sure if they were pulled from the dryer early so guests would have towels or not. A resort employee came out of the Sun Room and I politely ask her if the towels were clean. Rather than greet me with a smile and explain the check in/out procedure to me, this employee continues to walk away and says something that I can't understand because she if facing away from me as she walks off. I say, \"Excuse me but I didn't hear you\". She then turns half way around and states (with the tone of a 15 year old teen-age girl), \"I said there dirty\" At first, I just ignore her and head for the beach but I couldn't get past the resort gate before I became so angry that I turned around and paid a visit to management. Management seemed embarrassed and said they would take care of it. Even more amazing is that one of the managers excused this employee\u2019s behavior by telling me that she simply wasn\u2019t feeling well that day. I've been a middle school educator for twenty years and I can take attitude with the best of them. Middle school students can really test your patience and I have plenty of it, but I'm not about to take an attitude like that from a resort employee while on vacation. There is no excuse! 4) Remember the comment about taking the stairs due to overcrowded elevators. I forgot to mention the smell of urine at the bottom level of the stair well beside the elevators. The stairs were filthy. 5) Kitchen was not equipped with measuring cups or baking dish. We request both items at approximately 5:30PM. They were delivered at 7:15ish. By this time, my wife had already improvised and we were finished eating. Last week, while at Bonnet Creek, we were missing oven mitts and kitchen towels. We called the front desk and had them within 5 minutes. Every aspect of Orlando\u2019s Wyndham Bonnet Creek was outstanding. 6) Shower door missing handle on inside so it was a challenge to shut the door. Tile floor has a sticky film on it. There was beach sand still in the showers. (Maybe all minor issues, but with everything else that has occurred, we are getting very frustrating) 7) Day 3 (Friday), I go to the front desk to check on the status of our room. The same young man that checked me in tells me that the rooms still haven't been assigned but he took my name and room number and told me that he would have management call me. We never heard a thing. 8) Day 4: (Saturday), 7PM, my key isn't working. I go to the front desk to fix the problem and while there, I AGAIN ask about our room status. I'm told that we have been assigned a room in the south tower and must pack up everything by tomorrow morning and move. Not only that, the front desk graciously offered to allow us to stay in our room until 11AM (one hour past normal check out time), store our personal belongings and food until 2PM at which time they would allow us to check into our new condo two hours earlier than the actual check in time of 4pm. Essentially, Ocean Walk is telling us that right smack in the middle of our family vacation, they expect us to pack everything up (food and all); we won't have access to our personal belongings or a room for three hours; and they sincerely believe that they are doing us a big favor by storing our personal belongings. UNBELIEVEABLE! At any rate, my wife and I visit with the desk supervisor and we are told that the woman who has our current condo reserved has a \"Do Not Move\" request on her reservation. She also has reserved three 2 bedrooms, side by side and she owns 500,000 points, (which is more than us). Suffice to say, we are told that there is nothing that can be done and they must honor her reservation. We are also told that Ocean Walk has no other 2 bedroom \u201cocean front\u201d condo available so we are being moved to an ocean view rather than ocean front condo. The staff attempts to assure us that we are NOT being downgraded due to the fact that both condos are 2 bedroom deluxe condos. Yeah right\u2026I\u2019m sure they have people chomping at the bit to reserve ocean view condos rather than ocean front condos. After I inform them that I too had a \"Do Not Move\" attached to my reservation, they inform me that the \"Do Not Move\" was on my second reservation for the final three nights. :o).... Yup...that's correct\u2026. I did NOT want to be moved from my ocean view condo but was okay with being moved from my ocean front condo or was it that I didn\u2019t wish to be moved to a different room on the day that I check out. Either way, it doesn\u2019t make sense and I tried to explain this to them. It is obvious that they made a mistake and put the \"Do Not Move\" request on the wrong confirmation. We ask the night manager what would happen if we refuse to move or if we would have taken a day trip on Sunday without being notified that we had to move condos. She tells us that she can\u2019t speak for day management but they could take possession of our personal belongings and lock us out. So, on our ONLY Saturday night of vacation, we spend an incredible five hours on this situation\u2026(two hours in conversation and three hours (8PM - 11PM) packing up and moving to a room in a different tower). Our new view is now the Ocean Walk shopping district roof top. It is absolutely breathtaking! I wish I would have thought to take a picture so you could see it. 9) Day 5/6: Sunday and Monday: We are in our new condo. Ceiling fans (in both bedrooms and living room) make loud grinding noise at any speed higher than slow. Shower door will not shut but DOES have a handle. I repeatedly grab handle to shut door while taking shower. Living room TV is missing the power button. There is simply a hole where the button should be. As long as we don\u2019t lose the remote, we can turn the TV on and off. No remote and we will be unplugging the TV to turn it off. Balcony is smaller with only two chairs for a two bedroom. Also, we can smell cigarette smoke in both bathrooms. I guess I shouldn\u2019t complain as I\u2019d rather have it in the bathrooms than the kitchen, living room, or bedrooms. I assume that the ventilation system in the bathroom is connected with nearby rooms. There are some positives: Elevators in south tower aren\u2019t busy at all. I found the elevator waiting with the door open on numerous occasions. Condo is actually cleaner than room that we had in north tower. 10) Day 7 Tuesday \u2013 This is a huge resort with tons of people. From my understanding, it only has two computers that have printer access. Both in the adult lounge (north tower). Internet is very slow. While attempting to print boarding passes for our return trip home, only one of the two computers will pull up the airline website. I visit with two more families (one in the process and the other had already) been denied a two bedroom condo. One couple was attempting to print their reservations for a two-bedroom because Ocean Walk was attempting to put them in a one-bedroom or charge them points for a two bedroom that they had already reserved. They were able to print off their reservations and did receive a 2 bedroom condo. Can a resort be this unorganized? 11) Wednesday \u2013 We check out with no problem. My wife and I are truly not negative people and I hate the negative aspect of this post. I just feel that I need to be honest and warn others about this place. I want to note that we were moved to the south tower and we walked past a vacant two bedroom ocean front condo every day from Sunday to Wednesday. There were a few positives. For instance, while printing our boarding passes, the printer ran out of ink. The young lady that was working the recreation desk was most helpful and very pleasant as she conducted business. We did run into some pleasant bellmen and a couple of security guards. Let me just say that the view at this resort is absolutely beautiful and the potential of this facility is unbelievable. I can only assume that the resort has severe management and organizational issues. I would recommend that if you stay here and when, NOT IF you have problems, don't stop at the front desk supervisor, don\u2019t stop at the resort management, but if your Fairfield/Wyndham owners, go to Wyndham\u2019s national customer service line. Before contacting the national reservation line, all we heard were excuses and lies. After speaking with Wyndham\u2019s national line, we felt much better and felt that our negative experience at Ocean Walk was important to them. If you must stay here, you\u2019ll simply need to ignore the many problems of this resort as well as their total disregard for the comfort and satisfaction of their guests. Hopefully, Wyndham will get this taken care of promptly.", "Date": "July 7, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Findlay, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cJust love this resort!\u201d", "Author": "MzTrina1", "ReviewID": "UR17615809", "Content": "We have been going to this resort since the year my daughter was born (2004) every year.

This property offers a lot of things from vacation therpy spa which is great...Fitness center which we haven't used, computer room, activitys for kids most of the day. The pool inside I wish they would turn the heat up on the water. It was pretty chilly. I also wish they had a hot tub indoors because the last 3 years we have been there we didn't use hot tubs as there were nothing but a bunch of teenagers in it goofing until they closed down for the night. I think Adults should be able to swim and be in hottub at own risk of course, after hours. Us adults are unable to enjoy these amenitys when there are teens around goofing off and the pools are packed with splashing children and so on. Don't get me wrong I have children as well but it would be great to be able to go out late at night for a nice, QUIET swim. They could also use a few more elevators at the size of this place there should be 8 instead of 4. Elevator wait time at times is horriable. Even with the few things I may have complained about I LOVE this place & go every year.

There wasnt anyplace in the hotel to get sugar for our coffee so we had to wait until Starbucks opened and that was kinda bad. Other than that it was great. I would definitely recommend it to anyone and would go back. The towel deal could have been explained better. We saw a big cart full of folded towels by the sun center so we took a few, went back the next day to get another one and that was when we were informed that those were the dirty ones and you have to sign out clean ones and check them back in or you get charged $15 per towel. No big deal, I just think they should explain this at check in so people dont use the dirty towels like we did. Maybe have a sign or something, I saw alot of people grabbing out that bin.

The pools were great, especially since that was what really drew us to this property. The kiddie pool was closed for what looked like serious maintenance when we arrived, but we were pleasantly surprised to find it open on the second day. The pool decks were crowded and chairs were hard to come by, but we spent most of our time swimming anyway, so we didn't really care that chairs weren't available. Drinks at the poolside bar were pricey, but no restrictions on bringing your own from your room. The poolside bar even had cups available for you so that you didn't bring glass poolside!

As we all get strapped from every end of our budget, we demand better value for our precious travel dollar. If I spend thousands for a week in Florida, I better at least have windows that open. OceanWalk was nice in almost every other way. The kids loved the pools, the beach and the kids area in the basement. We had overall good service - there were some glitches.

We stayed here before when it was owned and operated by Fairfield and had a great time with excellent service. This time was terrible, as far as service goes. First of all, when I booked the room (we had a large 2 bedroom, 2 bath unit) I asked specifically about the balcony situation because I was told by someone that their balconies were being worked on and that I might have a locked out balcony. The man on the phone became very rude, and I said, well, I might have to cancel the reservation and go somewhere that appreciates my business, he said \"that's your prerogative\". Poor attitude. Anyways, we decided to take the chance and keep the booking. When we arrived, I had to stand in 3 different lines to check in. They kept asking me how I booked it (internet, phone, etc.) Each time, I told them, I booked it through your reservation phone line. They kept telling me to go to a different line. After standing in line for 30 minutes, our room wasn't ready, so they gave us our wrist bands and off to the pool we went. We went to pick up our towels and were told that we only get 1 towel per person for the entire stay. Yep, that's right, no fresh towels after a long day of sunscreen and sand. We have to wash them ourselves in our unit if we want them to be clean. With Fairfield, we got to pick up fresh towels each morning. We went back 3 times to check and see if our room was ready. Finally, it was ready. When we get up there (20th floor) the maids are still in there cleaning. So, we wait for 30 minutes until they are finished. Then we leave for dinner and we come back and we are locked out of the room. We call downstairs to get security up there to let us in. We have a 3 year old and a 6 year old who have to use the restroom. We wait 25 minutes for them to come up and let us in and then the guy tells us we have to go back downstairs to get new keys made. Well, guess what, 2 out of the 4 elevators in our tower are broken. So, it literally takes 20 minutes to go down stairs and 20 minutes to come back up!!! People were cramming into these elevators, making alarms go off and people screaming at each other b/c it is overcrowded. Crazy. There was a fight that broke out in front of my 2 children on the elevator. Nothing was done about the elevator problem for 2 DAYS and the hotel was sold out!!! That is unacceptable to me. The next day we wake up to a beautiful GREEN pool. Disgusting. It was roped off and closed for 24 hours while they poured a thousand gallons of chlorine in the pool. The other pool was also disgusting. Bandaids, hair, snot, you name it, was floating around. I never did see anyone cleaning the pools and I was up late and up early. So, when the green pool was closed, you can imagine how crazy busy the other pool was. We go to complain about all of our poor service and guess what, we were given 2 complimentary breakfasts just like one of the pp stated. We went to use the complimentary breakfasts this morning on the day of checkout, you got it, no breakfast during the week. No one told us this, so again, we went to complain and we were told that a manager would call us ASAP. No call so far.

The unit was EXACTLY as the photos reflected from the rooms to the view. The unit we stayed in was in the South Tower so, except for one or two occasions, the elevator wasn't an issue. The property is older but was lovely for Daytona. It is located on the part of the beach where driving is prohibited so it felt much safer to sit on the beach with the kids. As is typical for Daytona, the beach is much harder so it's great to walk on but not so great for collecting sand shells (one daughter's favorite early morning activity). The facility was busy for spring break but it wasn't overrun with the crazy college spring break kids I've seen on other trips. Now, we may just have hit it at the right time. The pools were nice though in need of a little updating. The lazy river was freezing but some kids still loved playing! Because of the height of the hotel, the shade hits the pools pretty early. This probably isn't an issue later in the summer but it made it pretty cool in the spring. We tried to book an activity with the activities group but the class was full. I guess the lesson learned is to book the day you arrive if something is interesting. We are folks who use stairs to exit and I have to say they had not been checked in quite a while. There was a lot of food and beer bottles in the hallways and they were not cleaned up the entire time we stayed. One hassle was internet service. Our unit was supposed to have it but apparently it didn't work with my wireless. So, to use the facilities, you have to go down to the lobby bar or the computers in the basement. When I was using the computer room int he basement, there were several owners meeting and complaining about the facility. Let's just say, they weren't happy with things. Glad we don't own but we did enjoy our stay! Finally, we heard others complain about being hounded by the time-share offers.

Our room was on the 5th floor looking out over the roof of the Ocean Walk shopping plaza that it is connected to. So needless to say we did not have a balcony BUT the room was huge. 2 bed rooms, the masterbed room had a huge king size bed, whirlpool tub that my kids loved, shower, etc. The guest room had 2 double beds and another normal bathroom with a washer and dryer. At first I was upset about not having a balcony but in all reality, we were never in the room anyway... so it didn't matter. I read previous posts about wet carpet from cleaning... there was one wet spot BUT I was just glad that the carpet was clean. Towels... they do not have room service to clean make beds, vaccume, etc. I thought I only had 2 bath towels for the week, so I requested more. They brought about 6 more up then I found the others in under the bathroom sink. I just washed a small load ever day or 2 of laundry and it was fine. They also rent you beach towels. One nice thing about doing the laundry is that I had NONE to do when I got home :0) The putt putt on the 4th floor was nice, the game room nice, computer rooms nice, lazy river... awesome, Turtle nest ... awesome, no one without an arm band was allowed up from the beach and that was nice, go cars across the road... awesome, Bubba Gumps next door.. awesome.

The unit is very large (maybe 1100 or 1200 square feet, not including the balcony) and had a double sized balcony that can be accessed from the living room or one of the bedrooms. The unit itself was clean and well appointed -- sofa, two large living room chairs, rectangular dining room table with six chairs and a counter attached to the kitchen with three chairs. The decor is very nice -- great colors and themes. One bedroom has a king size bed and the other features two double (54 inch) beds. Rooms were very clean although the bedspreads were a bit tired. Each bedroom features a television with cable. The kitchen has a microwave, stove, fridge, dishwasher, dishes and utensils. The kitchen was very clean and fairly large. The dishwasher was a bit balky. There are two bathrooms -- one with a double sink, shower and hot tub and the other a basic sink and tub. Everything was spotless. You have a small washer and dryer, which worked very well. They provide you with soap, dishwasher detergent, a couple of small laundry soap boxes, shampoo, conditioner, etc. There were lots of towels, but you will probably have to wash them if you are staying for a week. This is not a problem. You can go out and buy some additional laundry soap. You bus your own garbage to a shoot in the hall. The unit itself would earn a grade of \"A\" in my view. There are two outdoor pools, one indoor pool, a 'lazy river' ride (inner tubes pushed by a current around a circular water track) and an outdoor hot tub. The pool area features good security coverage (they will ask you to produce your access card or an arm band) and is busy at certain points in the day. Very nice setup. The beach is not really private as a previous reviewer indicated but it is in a pedestrian only area and there is easy access to the hotel pool area from the beach. There is a bar by the pool, which seemed to close its doors at a reasonably early time. The water was 75 degrees in the ocean but you are advised not to go out too far due to the current (waist deep). The staff at the front desk and in the hotel were friendly and helpful. There was a bit of construction work around the parking entrance area but this was not a big problem. You could enter the garage through a back entrance.

I have been planning this trip for quite awhile and kept coming back here to read all the new reviews that were posted to see what I could find out about the resort since I had not stayed there before. After reading the reviews, I was very concerned and thought I had made a HUGE mistake to plan a family vacation at a place I didn't know much about. We arrived at about noon and our room wasn't ready so we checked our luggage and went and did what we wanted and retrieved our luggage when we were able to check in (my parents also rented a condo and arrived at noon and their room was ready and they went right up, so yes they DO let you check in before 4:00pm if the room is ready). I was very nervous about the condo but there was no need to be. It was a VERY nice room. We rented a one bedroom condo and we were on the 15th floor. We ended up on the side of the building, overlooking the Ocean Walk shops and had a partial ocean view. It was perfectly fine with us. If you are not willing or able to pay the extra for the ocean front rooms then you need to be satisfied with the view you get and we were more than pleased with the room, ocean-front or not. Also, if you are on the street side of the hotel, you do have a water view of the Halifax River, which is very nice. Our condo was very nicely furnished with modern furniture and a nice booth-like eating area in the dining room. We had a large bathroom with a jacuzzi tub and a separate shower that was huge. The bedroom was really nice sized and had a king sized bed. We were very pleased with how clean and nicely furnished and painted it was. I don't know if some people don't understand that this is a condo, not a hotel but no....there is no maid service and it explains this in the directory if you take the time to read it. They are not going to come make your bed for you and give you clean towels. There is a washer/dryer in the unit and they give you two complimentary boxes or laundry detergent. It's a very small washer and we were able to do four loads of laundry with the two boxes of detergent we received, no problem. There was more than enough dishwasher detergent and liquid dish soap as well. I have no idea why anyone would need to go out and buy any themselves as I read in other reviews. I saw many people setting their trash out in the hallway for someone to take away and it sat there for a couple of days. I also read in the directory that you are to place it in the trash chute, which you walk right by to get to the elevators so we had no problem taking our trash and dropping it off and there were plenty of extra bags under the sink and also inside the bottom of the trash can. I had read about the issues with waiting in line for longer than an hour to check in but when we got there, I probably waited 1-2 minutes to both check in and check out. We had no problems with that. We also had no problems with the elevators. I never waited any longer than 1-2 minutes for an elevator at the VERY MOST. Generally it was there within seconds after hitting the button. Also, I never saw anyone placing towels on chairs at the pool and then leaving. We were down there several times and never had a problem finding a chair and never really noticed any chairs sitting with towels on them. There are PARTS of the pool area that are shaded after 1:00pm but certainly not the entire pool area. I was specifically curious after reading that so I made a point of checking on it and yes, there were certain areas that were shaded but definitely not the entire pool area. I could still find sunny parts up until about 3:00pm when we were there. We felt the pool area was more than accomodating for the number of people there but I imagine it might be different during Spring Break and I avoid travelling during that time due to the number of people you have to deal with. All in all, we had a wonderful time and would recommend this condo to anyone that asked. I thought the grounds were very nice, the staff was decent. Not OVERLY friendly but not rude either. There were several security guards around the building and in the pool area, which was nice to see.

We were just there for a week with our almost 2 year old. Nice family atmosphere, right on the beach, nice kiddie pool area, restaurants and water park next door. The pool area is large, but probably not quite big enough for the enormous resort. If half the people didn't go to beach there would be trouble. It was hard to get a chair if you didn't go out early. Of course we were out by 9:00am with our little guy. The pool is shaded by 1:00pm so it's best to do the pool in the morning and then move out to the beach in the afternoon. We used a week of my in-laws time share vacation for our stay so it only cost us $150 for the week. Of course we were pleased for that price - but if we had paid more I'm not so sure... We had an okay 1 bedroom with a great view of the ocean, which was a bonus surprise. The units without a view looked terrible. Windows facing into the hallway that were beat by the sun all afternoon. Probably very loud too. In room washer/ dryer was great - not sure if they all have that. Especially since you don't get any fresh towels for a week. I washed ours frequently at my own expense. We got two packets of laundry soap and when I called to get more I was told I had to go buy it. Also couldn't get anymore dishwasher soap, dish soap, paper towels, or garbage bags. I just took a trip to the dollar store down the road, but I was a little surprised by how rude housekeeping was when I called to ask. Check in time if 4:00pm and we weren't allowed in a minute before that. You can park early though and use the pool and beach if you arrive earlier in the day. That was okay, but I did have a problem with check out time. It's a ten in the morning. At 9:30 my husband started taking luggage out to the car - he was surprised to find housekeeping standing outside with their cart ready to come in. They stood there and watched him make 2 trips to the car, then started beating on the door at 9:45. I was so surprised I didn't say anything at the time, but.... We didn't have much contact with staff members other than the rude housekeeping department. There were several security gaurds stationed throughout the resort that were friendly and did seem to be doing a good job of checking for wrist bands or hotel keys.

We chose this resort for its location and amenties for children. I grew up in Daytona and am very familiar with the beachside, but this resort was built new after I moved away, so I was not familiar with it before we stayed there. Pros: Location is great, right on the beach. Attached to the boardwalk, which is undergoing renovations. Restaurants and a movier theater (and Starbucks) are right by the hotel. The hotel itself has indoor miniture golf, two indoor pools, a nice lobby, and a nice pool deck. The room was large and had a nice jacuzzi tub, the kitchen was well-stocked and the washer and dryer were very useful. Cons: The room we got was on the opposite side of the beach, so we had a view of the parking garage. The view was awful, we could smell car fumes when we had the sliding door open, and because the hotel is so tall, we could not even hear the beach or waves. The carpets were filthy, and my 1 year old was filthy from crawling on them. The service was ok, the staff responded to calls but were not always friendly. The bellman made it seem as if it was an imposition to help us with our luggage. Since we went in November, it was a little cool out, and the pool deck only had sunlight up till noon everyday since the very tall resort buildings blocked the sun after noon. So, we could only swim outside from about 9 till noon. The beach was covered in seaweed and there was only about 10 feet of beach between the seawall and the water. The seaweed is not clered off, so you really can't do anything on that stretch of beach. We drove to another beach to sit and play in the sand. Since this place is a timeshare place, we did do a presentation to get free Disney tickets. The presentation was nice and the salesman was pleasant. Be aware that Daytona Beach boardwalk area is still a little sketchy - not much has changed since I moved away. You will find homeless people hanging out on the boardwalk and asking you for money and cigarettes. Since I knew where I was I was not bothered by this, but if I had never been to Daytona, I would be unnerved by this.

The unit was exactly like the photos on line. It was clean and had everything we needed to make our stay comfortable. The resort itself had activities on every day for everyone in the family, so we could choose to participate or to just enjoy the pools and the beach. There was never any pressure to participate. (The \"dive-in-movie\" was a big hit with us all.) There are security people all over the place, so we felt somewhat safe there, but it didn't take long to notice that there are many ways into the resort without going through security, so it isn't quite as safe as it seems, but even so...some security is better than nothing, and more than you will find in most places. We never encountered any trouble there that's for sure. Beware of the \"short tours\" of the resort scam.

The kitchen and bathroom were like new and very clean. The only work that was needed in the condo was that the livingroom furniture and carpeting really needed updating. The view was fantastic. The pool deck is not very big but we found that with children we didn't really get to lay out much anyways. One bad thing was that one of the pools was closed for a few hours almost everyday from either glass or debris. We felt that glass containers should be monitored a little more closely by security or lifeguards. This caused the other pool to be very croweded but at least there was another pool to go to.

The first half was spent at Bonnet Creek in Orlando, (which was wonderful), for a few days of theme parks for the kids. We arrived early around 11:00 in the morning and our room was ready. We were asked if we wanted to do the timeshare talk and we said no, and they promised us we would receive no phone calls about the timeshare. Well we received 4-5 calls per day starting around 7:30 in the morning (not when you want to be awoken on your vacation by annoying timeshare people) It wasn't even just the hotel people, they apperently \"sell\" the names and room numbers of their guests to a timeshare week place down the street, because they called us numerous times everyday, and they said they got our names and numbers from the hotel itself. We complained about this and the hotel stopped calling but the timeshare week people did not. Other than almost every game in the game room being broken (both air hockey tables) and the mini golf being very bad the hotel itself is very nice. Our room was clean, the only problem we had with the room, was in the extra bedroom and bath, there are a total of 4 doors. Only two locked. That was a problem as we had 3 children with us to tend to not knock on doors. The door to the hallway locked and the door to the bath and bedroom locked but the actual bedroom door and the door between the toilet and bath tub did not lock. We had a nice view of the ocean and pools. The elevators at this hotel were horrible to say the least. The only time we didn't wait at least five minutes for an elevator was very late at night, and the stairs weren't much of an option as we were on the 19 floor. There are only four elevators and over 20 floors of rooms. When you did get an elevator they sometimes were to full for you to even get on, and you would have to wait again for another. The pools were very crowded, and were full of sand, you must have a raft for the lazy river so you also usually must wait for those. The beach was nice at low tide, there was a sandbar the kids loved. I am not much on swimming in water where I can't see what is around me, so I didn't care for the beach much, but the guys loved body boarding and the kids liked it.

You are also to wear a band at the pool to identify guests. About 1/3 of the people did not wear them. I saw security walking around but not enforcing any of these rules. Our A/C was not working correctly on arrival. After speaking to the front desk we had maintenance at our room in 5 minutes to backflush the system.

The attached Ocean Walk has a number of these along with a movie theater. We enjoyed the grilled shrimp at Shell's, crab legs at Charlie Horse. The Oyster Pub was good too with great french fries.

The desk staff was helpful and gave us good information. We had a 3 bedroom suite which has a balcony facing the beach. The unit had no major problems. Minor ones included no TV remote for the master bedroom, and the living room tv remote did not work well. Cooking supplies as in pans, etc., were quite slim, but we managed. Due to what we had to pay for the unit, we chose to eat as many of our meals in as possible. The refrigerator and ice maker was turned to the off position when we arrived, so it took a few minutes for the frig and freezer to get cold and the ice to produce. The unit was clean and well done. We only asked for additional wash clothes and all were delivered within 15 minutes. Then the desk called to make sure they were delivered. There are 4 elevators which serve each tower. There can be a wait during busy times of the day. We used those times to get a short workout and take the stairs to our 10th floor. Our 4 kids, ages 10-15, enjoyed the mini golf and game room. The pools were crowded on the weekend days but slowed down considerably on weekdays. On the weekend, the chairs were taken or marked with towels very early. Mgmt did issue notices to those who had not used their towels within 30 minutes by not being at the pool. It all seemed to work out. Parking can be tight in the parking structure. By late in the evening, spaces are hard to find. I was notified that a $12 a day charge would begin by 6/1. We did not eat at the resort except at the pool bar one day. Due to the crowd, it was extremely busy and very slow. The pools were great, the water warm, and the late night activities such as the \"dive in\" movie was great. This was a large, inflated movie screen by the pool. Access to the beach was very convenient through a gate at the back of the middle of the pool area. Vendors are immediately behind the gate with umbrellas, chairs, etc. for $25/day. It was convenient to have everything next door such as the movie theatre, Johnny Rockets, Starbucks, Baskins-Robbins across the street, IHOP down the street, etc. The beach was great, waves were good...we had no problems at all. We would seriously consider the resort again. We paid about $300/ night. This resort is next door to the Hilton Resort. I believe these two resorts are by far the nicest in this area of the beach.

We got an immaculate, 2 bedroom jacuzzi suite on the south side of the14th floor of the south tower. That means we had a fabulous view of the ocean to our left, the Halifax River to our right, and the A1A strip straight ahead. I couldnt have hoped for a better location- (and I knew asking in advance is useless) The art-deco styled rooms were freshly painted, with new carpets, and not a broken , shabby or worn thing anywhere to be found. The kitchen even had brand new appliances, and the bowls were even artfully arranged in the cupboards! The jacuzzi didnt leak and the screen door to the balcony was not broken. (it gets windy and chilly up there at night, so bring a sweater) The whole resort is getting a face-lift inside & out . We overheard one painter telling another that it's because the city is trying to spruce up in order to attract the big Miami money up to Daytona- and as a result get property values to increase. Maybe we picked a good week, or just lucked out, because there was never a wait for the elevators, there were always plenty of pool loungers available at any time of day- even on the weekend. The pools were warm , no rowdy kids, and the staff was super friendly and helpful our entire stay. We checked in on a Monday at 4pm, and walked right up to the desk. At check-out on Sunday, there was a line, but it moved quickly.All you really need to do is drop your key off in the box, but I wanted to make sure I had no outstanding charges against my $100 credit card deposit. The pranksters that must have been in our room the week before set both alarm clocks to go off at 6am the next morning, and they shut the door of our in-room safe. We called the front desk about that, and engineering was up to our room in less than 10 min. to unlock it. We took a cab from the airport ($25 each way inc. tip for 4 of us) Didn't need to rent a car- plenty of places to eat next door at the Ocean Walk Shoppes, or within walking distance. our fave restaurant was Adobe Gila's next door. The Daytona Beach bandshell is right there, and the \"boardwalk\" to the pier- starts there, too. The city is building a park, or extending the boardwalk in front of the resort, so you cant access the beach from the pool area anymore. If you dont want to walk thru the construction zone to get there, just go down the steps and cut across the plaza in front of the bandshell to get onto the beach. It's great for walking ,sunbathing & swimming, but you wont find any good shells there. We wanted to visit the Ponce Inlet lighthouse and the Speedway, so we bought a 3-day bus passes for $6. (half that for seniors). The bus station is right across the street, and you can take the covered walkway there. The buses go everywhere you'll ever need to go.- including the supermarket. That's one drawback- no nearby places to buy food., altho the Walgreens 2 blocks north has a pretty good supply of staples, drinks and beach supplies at reasonable prices. We walked about a half a mile north on Atlantic Ave. and found a small, but well stocked liquor store. Now for the bad stuff. ---The resort seems to be pretty lax on security. Most guests were not wearing their wristbands at the pool, and the guards were not checking. Anybody can get thru the pool gate onto the property, and in fact someone had their valuables stolen while they were in swimming. , and the police were there taking the report. One day there were about 5 security people on our floor, and we overheard a guest giving them a description of somebody as we passed by. We also personally had items stolen from our room while we were out . This is the weird part- all they took was food! They didnt touch the 2 bottles of liquor, cameras, binoculars & other goodies in plain view . We immediatly reported it to the night manager on duty and he did a \"lock interrogation\" to see who accessed our room besides us. Sure enough, housekeeping (they all use the same card) had been there for less than 2 minutes- even tho we didnt get housekeeping, or any supplies dropped off. The manager made good by coming up to our room personally & replacing the items that were taken from their hotel kitchen. All I can say is you have to use common sense and take precautions when at a large resort such as this.

Well, here I am feeling so strongly about the bad situation that I just experienced at the Ocean Walk Resort, that I feel it necessary to write a review. I will start with the short story: I checked in and then checked out within 2 hours of arriving. Here's the longer version: When I reserved the room which was for a business trip, I reserved an oceanfront room with a King size bed. I called the hotel about 3 days prior to arrival just to double-check on the reservation and was told that it was there, they had me in a room with a king bed, and the guy at the resort even told me that my room # had been assigned and gave me that information. I found that odd (since we were communicating over the phone, how could he be sure I was the actual guest who was going to be staying at the property?...that was a safety issue in my mind), but figured they do things a little differently here. After checking in I went up to the room and upon arriving at the door noticed that the white doors were very dirty. Not a good sign for someone who is very particular about cleanliness in a hotel. I went in and found that the bedroom was right at the front of the unit, with a window that opened to the hallway where people walk up and down to go to their rooms. Because of where my room was I literally had a view of the elevators. I didn't really like that set up, (would have preferred for the living room to be at the front and the bedroom at the back closer to the ocean), but figured I would just close the blinds and pull the curtains on the bedroom window so that people walking by couldn't see me and the light from the hallway would not bother me when I was sleeping. However, when I went to pull the curtains closed, they didn't move. They were \"fake\" curtains that were purely decorative and not functional, so I could close the blinds (which didn't close tightly and the light from the hallway still shone through), but I couldn't pull the drapes. I decided that I would go downstairs to see if there was another room that was set up differently. I noticed as I was leaving that the room didn't really have a \"clean\" feeling and the furniture looked tired. Also, the bedspreads on the 2 double beds didn't match. That looked really tacky. I went downstairs and asked the front desk worker (a different person from the lady who initially checked me in) if they had any rooms that didn't have windows that faced the hallway from the bedroom. He said that they do have rooms where the bedroom is at the back of the unit that would match what I was looking for. He said they were a slightly upgraded unit. I told him I was fine with that, I would pay the difference in price. He looked for a room, found one that was supposedly available, and gave me my 2nd get of keys. I went upstairs and thought to myself \"that wasn't bad...so glad I spoke up and asked about a different room\". I went in the room and as I headed to the bedroom, realized it was an un-cleaned room. The bedspread was on the floor, towels were on the floor in the bathroom, the kitchen had not been cleaned...it was a little disarming. So I called down to the front desk and told them that the room was not clean. I asked if someone from housekeeping could come up and clean it for me. (I really wanted to stay in the room because the layout was so much better than the last room. I was willing to wait an hour if that is what was needed to get the room in clean shape.) The lady who I spoke to said that she had taken note of the issue. She seemed like she was hanging up but I had no game plan yet, so I said to her \"do you want me to just stay up here and you will call me back to let me know what is going on?\". She said yes. I had to call back down since time had passed without hearing back from them. I asked for an update and was told that I was being moved to another room. She then said the bellman will come to bring my new key. I went to the new room (this is now room #3). I go in and turn to put on the security bar and realize there is none. There is the normal bolt that you can turn to lock the door in the hotel room, but the security chain or bar that is usually in a hotel room so that even housekeeping cannot come in if you are in there was not on the door. I felt very uncomfortable with that, especially since I was going to be the only one sleeping in the room. Also, I have never stayed in a hotel that did not have that security feature. So I went back downstairs and told them that my room did not have the security bar. The girl at the front desk looked alarmed at that but then said that she would see if engineering could go up and install one for me. She came back and said that they actually could not install one for me. She said they would just assign me another room. She assigned me another room and I asked her if she could tell by looking in her system if this new room had the security bar. She said no, the only way to find out is by actually going to the room. So I headed up to the room (room #4). Upon entering, I realize there was no security bar/latch...again. I call back downstairs because I refuse to stay in a hotel room that doesn't provide me with the adequate safety features. The front desk person then says that she has another comparable room in terms of layout, but that it is smoking, and apparently that is all she had to offer me. I told her that I don't smoke and I want a non-smoking room. She responded that many times even though it is a smoking room, it doesn't smell like smoke. I said fine. She told me to just stay up in the room and someone will bring me my key. About 3 minutes later, after more thought, I decided that I didn't want to compromise and go to a smoking room. I decided to go downstairs to the business center to use a computer to look for another hotel. I found my way to the business center (which is really a pool hall/lounge with a couple computers along the wall), and searched for a nearby hotel that had availability without success. I proceeded to the front desk to let them know that I am checking out because they were unable, after 5 tries, to find me a suitable room (all I wanted was a clean, non-smoking room that had the security bar/latch). The front desk lady (the 4th person I have now dealt with at the front desk) proceeds to do stuff in the computer. She kept doing things and doing things. After about 10 minutes I finally said to her \"I am just checking...I presume you are processing my refund back to my credit card?\". She looked at me and said \"no, we can't give you back your money\". I told her that I had not even stayed in a room yet...I had not even been in the hotel itself for more than 2 hours...and in no one room for more than 20 minutes. She went and got another lady who I am assuming is some sort of supervisor. This lady is one who had helped me locate a room with a security latch earlier, so she was clearly aware of all the issues I had been having. She asked me how she could assist me. I told her that I was checking out and that I didn't want to be charged for the stay. She said that they have a 72 hour cancellation policy and that they could not give me my money back. I asked her what the charge would be and she said the whole amount had been charged to my card for the 2 day stay and they couldn't refund any of it. I looked at her incredulously and explained that the only reason I was leaving was because they could not find a suitable room for me after 5 tries and I was really tired and didn't want to continue the saga. She refused to give me back my money. That was the final sign to me that this was not the place for me to stay. How a hotel can keep $400 + from someone who never stayed at their hotel is amazing to me. She just kept telling me I was choosing to leave even though they kept giving me different options. So did she expect I would just spend the whole night going from room to room, hoping we would find a clean, safe one?? At some point any reasonable person needs to put an end to the fiasco, and I ended it after 5 tries. I wasn't going to argue with her...figured I will just dispute with my credit card company. The customer service was horrible, the rooms were not clean and looked very run-down (the closet in one of the rooms was broken and kind of just leaning up in the track, and the carpet was pulled up, as if a dog had just clawed it for a long time), and they did not have the appropriate safety features that standard hotel room should have. I called my boss to tell her that I was leaving and told her my experience. She said she was going to add my experience to her list because she had had so many issues already herself (she also did not have a security latch on her door in her room, among other poor customer service issues). This was the shortest & worst hotel experience I have ever had. I do not recommend that hotel at all if you have any level of class or discernment. If you just want a place to lay your head between sitting at the beach, then maybe it is the place for you.

If you're coming to stay for a long time, you can definitely treat it as a home away from home. The rooms are clean, but you don't get replacement towels each day. The beach is actually quite nice and not horribly crowded. The pool's a little different story - fairly overrun, but not awful. It's a little dirty and rundown - everyone in our party cut their foot while in the pool. Some okay stuff for kids, including a nice (but small) lazy river to float in. We didn't eat in the hotel's restaraunt, so I can't comment there. The parking's okay, assuming you have one car.

We rented directly from the owner, not the hotel. Check-in was a breeze, room ready on time, and the room was clean! (and I'm very picky). We bought all our own food, and even extra TP just in case, washed our own towels, which by the way, we had plenty for 7 people. You do have to wash your own towels and take out your own trash, but they have trash chutes on all floors. We felt very safe, always security walking around, checking wrist bands to see if you were a guest around the pool area. Always found a parking place, but we were never out super late maybe 9pm at the latest, with 4 small children. The only down side was that the elevators were slow at times, like check out times or \"time to go to the beach and pool\" times. But overall not too bad. Never waited for one longer than 5 minutes. You have to expect crowds if you go during spring break, and maybe even a little partying, but there was never anything that was too annoying, couldn't hear much thru the walls, and we had some parties going on above us a few nights. The pool does get crowded early, and you can't go down just to put your stuff on a chair, b/c if hotel staff walks around and sees no one in the chairs, they put a notice on them, and if no one has returned in 30 minutes, they remove your things and take them to the towel stand to be retrieved. I suggest renting 2 beach chairs, little table, and umbrella for $25/day, plus you can add extra chairs for $8 a piece. Pool does calm down later in the day, so go then. Whatever you do--don't order delivery from a restaurant called \"Pizza, Subs and More\". There was an advertisement in our room for it, so one night we called and it was the worst food ever!

Got kicked out of line twice stating that we were not allowed to pre register. Room was not ready by 4pm. When we finally got into our room, we were given a 1 bedroom instead of two. When I called down to the desk they told me I had to get back in line to get the room fixed. When I finally got the right room, we all decided to take showers, but no hot water. The whole tower had no hot water and this had been a problem for 2 days now, and they checked me in anyways. I went down to complain and there were 30 some people down in the hotel lobby complaining about the hot water. I finally got my room changed about 10pm at night. What a vacation. Then when we got to our new room, there were no towels and it was smaller than the original room. When I went to the desk, I was told that the laundry is sent to Orlando and the truck hasn't come in yet. I was able to get a few towels, but no washcloths for 3 days! The next day I called to see when my room would be cleaned, since when I booked it a year ago, I was told it would have housekeeping included. The woman laughed and said \"honey you must clean your own room, wash your own towels, and take out your trash!!!\" So I paid over $300.00 a night for nothing. The next morning I again went to the front desk and was given free dinner tickets for all my problems. So my family went to dinner the next evening. We ordered chicken, and actually got 4 plates of completely raw chicken. We returned it to the kitchen and they were very apologetic, but my kids got up walked out and went to Burger King. They did make sure they took pictures of their raw chicken!!The next day we went to Disney and came back at midnight to no parking spots. One day we lost power in our room. You definitely don't get what you pay for here at this hotel. The staff got to know me because of my frequent complaints, and they stated since they changed hands from Fairfield to Wyndham, the hotel has gone downhill. They fired most of their housekeeping staff. The staff hates it. They laugh about the inservice they must attend where they learn about MAGIC-making a good impression on the customer. This hotel makes an impression on the customer, but not a good one. You must go down to the desk for toilet paper or anything else you might run out of. Its a joke of a vacation staying here. I saved up all year to take my kids on this trip with their friends, and I was thoroughly disgusted. I have stayed at alot of hotels before, but this is definitley the worst. There were parties down the hall with kids getting arrested. It was very loud. There were missing pictures on the wall, just nails in the wall, the sliding glass door to the balcony didn't shut properly, so we were left with sand flies all over our room every morning. And you would think when a different company takes over, customers would be notified since it doesn't include the same things as when the room was booked. If it had housekeeping when it was booked, it should have it when I stay there or my price should be reduced. The owners of shops in Ocean Walk also laugh about the hotel. They say when they have friends and family come down, they won't let them stay at Ocean Walk because its so bad, they stay at the Hilton. The security is a joke. I also picked this hotel because it was supposedly safe and you needed your key to get into the hotel, parking garage and into the pool area. There was never a security guard at the pool gates. The gates were always open There were always kids walking around from different hotels. The elevator waits were sometimes 10 minutes long.

I am a little \"on the fence\" with regard to my review. I went expecting the worst after reading some of the more negative experiences on this site. After driving for some 20+ hours, I was in no mood for complications! We arrived at 2:30pm. Of course, our room wouldn't be ready till 4:00pm so they had me \"preregister\". This was supposed to save time... They did however, give us a temporary pass to the parking garage and the facitlity. So eventhough we didn't have a room to go to we could still park the car. So, I returned at 3:55pm to find a very long line of people at the front desk. Since I \"pre-registered\", I was taken around the corner where there was an equally long line. By the time I was totally checked in, with a room key in hand, it was 4:30pm. Our room was on the 10th floor. Our room was spacious but in desperate need of an uplift. The kitchen faucet was literally hanging in the sink. The carpet was ripped up in several places not to mention stained. The closet doors were off their tracks difficult to close. The handle for the balcony door was broken in half... The kitchen is well stocked... everything you could possibly need. The washer and dryer is a great feature. The bathroom is quite large and accomodating. There were several small things in some state of disrepair but overall, the room was okay. It was clean, at least. (Our faucet was replaced within a couple of hours) The elevators were busy, as someone else mentioned, but not that bad. Housekeeping is definitely an issue. We only saw the housekeeper once the entire week. And all she did was place a pile of clean towels on the kitchen counter while we were out. The pools were quite cold. The indoor pools were a little more bearable but still too cold for me. My kids played in the indoor pools every evening. The building is so huge that it actually blocks the sun from hitting the pool area and the beach by early afternoon. People really do \"reserve\" their pool chairs but placing various objects on them. They come down extra early and then return later in the morning. This practice is not condoned and we didn't complain but it is a problem. Luggage trolleys are impossible to get your hands on. It was spring break while we were there so it was quite loud and rowdy at times. Young people were up at all hours of the night yelling and carrying on. I realize this is not the resort's fault but it was annoying none the less. The one day we felt the kiddy pool was warm enough to put our children in, a mother found several peices of glass on the bottom. Securtity removed everyone from the pool. I guess I would agree with others in saying that the resort is in need of a facelift. It is very big (perhaps too big) and the concierge will encourage you to take part in seminars and tours regarding ownership of a unit at the resort. I wonder if maybe they put more emphasis on ownership rather that people who simply rent units. Overall, we had a good stay and we aren't the type of people who sweat the small stuff. I have stayed in worse places... I would probably recommend this resort to friends. The beach is quite nice and it is a vehicle free zone.

Stayed most of the time in a 2 bedroom deluxe unit. No problems with the unit. Everything was in good working order and very, very clean. I am posting pictures taken from our room. Please note, some rooms, I believe they contain a B in the room number, do not have a balcony or window to the outside. They face the interior hallway. You may want to inquire about your room type before you book the room. In addition, there are some rooms that do have a balcony but do not have an ocean view. We stayed in 2 different rooms during this trip. Both were in the north tower. In addition to the 2 bedroom deluxe, which faced north (beach view if we look to the right) we spent our last couple nights in a 1 bedroom deluxe which faced south, actually we had a view of the other tower and the lobby area. We didn't mind at all. I do not have photos of the one bedroom deluxe unit but it was also very clean, well appointed and everything was in good working order. Both rooms had a jacuzzi tub. Things to consider - I am not sure if this is true for all staying at this resort but we stayed as part of our timeshare/points system. There is no daily maid service. If you want a touch up, they will come and do that for a fee. Your bed will not be made unless you do it. You will not get fresh towels everyday. For touch up cleaning you are provided with a washer and dryer in your room, a vaccum cleaner, a dishwasher, a broom and a mop. They give you enough laundry soap for two loads and an adequate amount of paper towels, dish soap and dishwasher detergent. If you expect someone to come and bring you fresh towels and make your bed it is not going to happen (unless it is different for some folks renting rooms not as timeshares). If you are not sure if this applies to you, ask before you book your trip. If this (not happening) will ruin your trip you might want to stay somewhere else. If you enjoy a clean place with all of the ammenities you could imagine then stay here.

Since the time I needed required I book at least two nights, I couldn't complete the reservation. I called the resort.

I have since called the resort directly Every Day for the last six days. Six Days!!! I've called in the morning, afternoon and evening. 7:15am, 11:00am, 3:00pm, 6:00pm, 11:00pm and even 1:00am. Each time I'm told the front desk is busy and they are not answering. I even left a message with my return number at the request of the hotel operator who assured me that someone would call me. That was 2 days ago, I still haven't heard a word. I will be arriving in Daytona Beach in a few weeks. At this rate I will likely be sleeping in the lobby the first night.

We had read some complaints that the property was dirty. We did not find this to be so. The view, design of the rooms and location were fantastic. Yu are near the pier,arcades, shops and movies. Starbucks is a half a block away. We are from Portland,Oregon so we really enjoyed our morning latte. Some thoughts on the resort:: The design and architectural style of the resort is first class but it is not kept up as well as it should be and the staff although friendly aren't very attention oriented. They seemed lazy and not interested in resolving problems. I booked my stay for a week but later called to extend my stay by one night. They told me they would have to cancel my reservation and start again. If they did this there was a chance I would lose the whole reservation and no t be able to have the upper floor, ocean front unit I wanted. Since we booked six months ahead and I didn't want to lose my reservation, I didn't want to do this. At check-in I again asked to extend the stay. They said I could but would have to come down early on the check-out day to do this. I wanted to avoid getting up early and avoid the check-out lines so I tried to do it the night before. The desk-clertk said it was a done deal but the next day they called me twice, saying why haven't I checked out. My key also didn't work, after keying it twice. The maid also knocked on the door at 10:00 to make sure we were leaving,,when we weren't. It just seemed a little tacky and rude. Customers didn't come first. We had a very pretty two bedroom condo. The beds were comfortable and the rooms were very quiet with good black-out curtains. Although very well designed to look top quality, it had a broken armoir, a kitchen faucet that sprayed the counter, leaky tub and a dryer that you had to slam multiple times to close. At check-out I gave the repairs list to the front staff and they didn't seem to care or say they would get on it. The lazy river wasn't heated ( and it was thanksgiving vacation) and since it was cold out, the lifequard wasn't at the slide most of the day. It seems like they were trying to save money by hiring an unpolised front desk staff and defering maintence. Since many rooms are on a timeshare program, they seemed more interested in getting the money than keeping it or providing a quality vacation. Many of the hotels in Daytona are upgrading and refurbishing themselves, soon competetion will be tough.On a positive note, many child activities, arts and crafts were offered. The game room was fun. They had a large TV with Gamecube and Nintendo. There was free mini-golf and if you have teens, its near the movies and shops so you wouldn't need to drvie. Good restaurants are within walking distance. I recomment seeing the manatees at Blue Springs State Park, the Space Center and a trip to St. Augustines.

As always had a great time. We tend to set up shop down on the beach, so I don't know about the problems reserving poolside lounges. Beach was great; there is now an ice cream wagon parked on the beach most of the day right in front of the hotel, which is convenient. We bought the lunch by the pool every day; it's really convenient. The steak sandwich is a steak, not sliced steak, a small individual steak on a bun. At $6, it's a steal! They will cook the steaks rare and they were delicious. There were fireworks at about 9:30 on Saturday night, which we watched from our balcony. Very impressive; it lasted about 20 - 30 minutes and had some cool effects. The kids all loved it. The arts and crafts were fun; our whole family made stained glass, which are now proudly displayed on our kitchen window... I highly recommend this hotel.

I have noticed the many negative comments recently posted and I was a bit nervous, but we had no major problems. Our room was clean and tidy.

My initial disappointment is when I called the resort several days in advance to try to arrange our rooms all together (~5 in total). The first person I spoke to was very nice, and said that she could put something in the comments in each of our rooms requesting to be near each other. I made subsequent calls to verify that this would be done (up to the night before), and everyone seemed very unwilling to help make sure this would happen. Parking at the resort is not the greatest. It probably wouldn't be so bad, except that the garage only goes up 7 floors or so, and if your room is above that, you cannot even take the stairs up (in the garage). You are then tasked with having to walk to the other side of the resort to take stairs up, or wait for the elevator. The elevators in this resort were TERRIBLE. They have 4 in each tower which you would think would be enough to handle the load, but it isn't even close. You always have to wait 5-10 minutes MINIMUM for an elevator, and sometimes you can't even get on at that time because it is completely full. Housekeeping serivce was unreliable at best. I stayed in a room that was above a big area where the salesmen sign papers with people that want to purchase a unit. There was a light outside of my room that helps light up this area (5 floors lower). They did not dim this light at night, so 24 hours a day, there was a bright light outside my window. The blinds didn't even come close to blocking out all of the light that came in. There was also no small store in the hotel (or in the area of shoppes adjacent to the resort) to purchase little things like detergent, eggs, milk, etc. The one good thing I can say about the resort is that the pool is open 22 hours a day (closed for 2 hours for cleaning).

Finally my wife went to the desk on the 3rd day and stayed there, until they called housekeeping and demanded they clean our room...When we got to our room a few hours later, there was a bunch of towels on our bed and the old ones were gone....The bed was not made and that was the last time we saw housekeeping until the morning we were packing to check out, and they wanted to know when we were leaving. The rest of the family had housekeeping problems, but not to the extent of ours...We are not snooty or complainers and I have never wriiten a review before, but the service there was among the worst I have had in my 65 years here on earth. Despite the housekeeping problem, we had a great time visiting with the kids, grandchildren, and close friends but my family will never go back....Bob Knowles Brooksville, Florida", "Date": "August 4, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Florida", "Title": "\u201cHorrible Overall!!\u201d", "Author": "gotdirt", "ReviewID": "UR5530474", "Content": "We had 6 families each book a room with this resort.

We then had to sit in the hallway with all of our luggage for another 15 minutes, only to wait for a smelly, dirty, room with broken blinds, half of the light bulbs out and a broken balcony door. By the time we actually got into our room it was 6:30p.m. between elevators and checking-in. Again what a huge disappoint after all of that wait. Called twice about the broken blinds in the bedroom facing the hallways, they never came. Finally put an extra sheet over the window to keep people from looking in. The room smelled so bad that we didn't even want to eat in it. Very poor housekeeping. It also smelled like smoke. This was just the beginning. The staff was very, very rude and was not at all accomodating. The restaurant within the resort is a complete joke. The food and service was horrible. All the kids activities they advertise can only accomodate approx. 20 kids per activity. With the size of the resort you would think they would accomodate more, and did not care that your cildren could not attend. The pools were green and hot. There was no room to move and if you wanted a seat by the pool you better plan on waking up at about 6:30am to catch an elevator down to the pool to stand in line with everyone else to enter the pool area at 8:00am at which time the pool opens. At 8:00am people are scrambling to chairs like little ants to get a chair. The whole resort was flat dirty, especially the pools and pool areas. If you like to wake up to the sun rising be prepared for the wonderful sounds of the pressure cleaners cleaning the pool deck which they do from 6:00am through 8:00am. Teenagers from all over Daytona Beach were entering this resort to use the pools. If you like to hang around thousands of teens this would be the place to stay. If you would like some quiet, quality with your family, please do not waste your money. All six families we had there were fooled by their web-site. Don't let it happen to you.

Our party that the room name was under did not arrive until 5:00 later that evening. Upon my arrival, my friend and I checked our luggage with the bellman to put into storage until our friends had checked in. Both my friend and I changed from our airport clothes into our bathing suits and put the clothes and bathing suits we decided not to wear that day, back inside our suitcases. This is the last time I saw all my valuables that went missing when I recieved my luggage back. I had my pillow strapped in on top of all my packed clothes. My jeans and belt, bathing suits and skirt, and wristlet that were presumably stolen were placed on top of the pillow , NOT under the straps, or in the easily-accessable mesh compartment under the suitcase lid. Unfortunately, when I reclaimed my luggage, many items were missing. A list of what was missing and approximate value: -Bebe Jeans ($125) -American Eagle belt ($39) -Pink Coach wristlet ($68) -Bebe black rhinestone bathing suit ($85) -Polo Ralph Lauren black bathing suit ($95) -Hollister rhinestone jean skirt ($48) It is unfortunate these items are not covered under insurance as the resort suggested... it just saddens me because I bought these items with my own money, most of them for my exciting Spring Break adventure at the OceanWalk Resort, and I ended up losing items (approx.$460 worth) totaling more than my 5 night stay at the resort ($236). When we arrived early and couldn't check-in, I didn't even give a second thought to not trust the resort to hold my luggage. But the fact that the items missing were the easiest to access because of their location in my suitcase leads me to conclude they were taken during the time they were under the supervision of the resort. *** Also, when we handed our luggage over to the bellman, we were told they would be brought up to our rooms upon check-in. I had to call down to the front desk to inquire about my luggage, and with no results, then go down and ask about my luggage because it still hadn't arrived in our room an hour or more after our party checked-in at approximately 5:00---and we were getting worried! ***** After 4 months now of communicating (phone calls, emails and paperwork) with the resort staff and management and doing everything they suggested (filing a police report with the Daytona Beach Police; filing a claim with their insurance company) it seems Ocean Walk Resort Management has elected to ignore my communications and thus take no responsibility for my loss while my valuables were in their possession.", "Date": "July 27, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "gainesville, florida", "Title": "\u201cvery bad customer service!!!\u201d", "Author": "i'mlori", "ReviewID": "UR5494251", "Content": "Was one of the worst customer service's I've ever seen.

But I felt the \"lazy river\" became a loud, crazy zone of wild, unruly children pushing and shoving and turning it into bumper cars, with many \"tube-jackings\" (kids stealing inner tubes). Fortunately my usually quiet children stuck up for themselves and managed to maintain inner tubes long enough to enjoy themselves. The sign stated \"children under 12 must be supervised\" so I went in the River with them the first few times, but when I realized I was the ONLY adult in there being shoved & splashed, I quickly learned that the rule was not enforced. The bar at the pool served hotdogs and hamburgers, but we waited for 40 minutes by the scorching grill to get 3 hot dogs for $12. The beach was also EXTREMELY crowded. The beach chairs and umbrellas are not a part of the hotel and you must pay extra to rent them. We chose not to and just played in the ocean. On Sunday, things settled down a bit. We were actually able to get an elevator with only a 5 minute wait (15 minute waits were the norm on Saturday). We don't mind walking but they put us on the 17th floor). The lazy river was almost lazy instead of crazy on Sunday and Monday. The biggest problem that I did not plan for was the lack of POOL TOWELS! BRING YOUR OWN!

The views were to die for, we were on the 17th floor which i was a little concerned about with having a very active 3 year old, as the balcony wall and rails were quite low, but our patio doors were quite difficult to open for myself, and my husband as the runners were slightly faulty, due to the salt air.......the beds were very comfortable, and good quality bedding.....A beautiful bathroom with plently of towels, the only bad thing about the bathroom was the cheap shower curtain rail, which with the slightess touch would fall from the walls.......but luckily my husband tightened it, so it was fine from there on........ ...The hotel itself is beautiful with 2 indoor pools which were beautiful and 3 outdoor pools which included a childrens pool and a lazy river..... i had a few bad points about the pool area though as there were very few chairs around the childrens pool, due to the fact that people without children would seat themsleves there..which really annoyed me as there were plently of seats around the main pools...this meant that families were forced to stand or sit on walls to watch thier children play in the pool.....Another thing which was really annoying about the pool area was the rush for seating in the mornings...people would queue before 7.30- 7.45 to get a seat, even though you were not allowed into the pool area before 8.00, after 8.00am it was manic, 100+ people running to get their spot.......by putting a towel or bag on the lounger, once they had done this they would then go, and sometimes not come back for hours, so when you came to the pool, the seats were empty, but we could not use them..! The hotel was very busy, but the staff i found were very helpful, in all areas. Great location across from Ocean Village shopes, and Daytona Water park. We would definately go back, but probably earlier in the year and would book the 2 bedroom oceanview unit.

We were there for a dance competition and local teenage boys stormed the place trying to get with the girls and would not leave. At night, scary locals just walk in and are getting on the elevators and roaming the halls. I don't understand why they do not have security at all entrances to keep intruders out?? Every night security guards were at the pool trying to find out who/what room people were throwing dangerous items over their balcony into the pool area.

It was just the two of us for this trip. We purchased this timeshare unit on e-bay, which was a first time experience for us and made the process a little scary. But, all went well. and we had no issues! We were very pleasantly surprised by the resort -- very lovely in all ways. All was better than we anticipated, and very nice. The units themselves were spacious and clean. Staff was friendly and pleasant. Prior to going, I read many complaints about not being able to get a lounge chair around the pool area. I honestly didn't get at all why people were worried about sitting around pool when they are right on the ocean. If you want to be at a pool - why go to the ocean. But, I can say that after being there, that small children would probably want to be around the slide, pool, lazy river, so that's probably the attraction for the pool chairs. But, we were delighted to sit in the sand by the ocean in front of the resort each day, just as we were dreaming of doing. That's why we wanted an ocean front hotel - to sit down by the ocean, not around a pool. If you go back close to the hotel, the sand is nice and soft - just what you would hope for. The tide coming in makes other parts of the beach harder. But, it was still very nice. If you want a lounge chair on the sand, versus just a beach towel- for under $10.00 you can go buy your own lounge chair for the week, rather than renting the two chairs/umbrella for $25.00/day. We got up early several mornings and had coffee on the balcony, and were able to watch dolphins. It was great. This was a perfect time of year to go as well -- after Easter/Spring Break and before summer vacations begin. Plenty of people around, but we didn't feel crowded at all. We didn't have any issues with lines for check in-but came on Sunday rather than Saturday. We also had no trouble at all with the elevators or waiting for them. All were very prompt and no problem at all. Again, may be the time of year we were there. In another review, someone complained about the music around the pool in the afternoon. We thought it was great. I guess everyone is just looking for something different.

The whole resort is A+++. A pleasant surprise around every corner. We can't wait to go back again. The beach is gorgeous and clean. The pools were immaculate and so enjoyable for all of us. The game room for the kids was perfect. The pier is beautiful! I can't say enough great things about it. If you are planning a trip here--you can email me with any detailed questions! I researched so many hotels and resorts before we traveled this year--I hope I can reassure you about this.

Ocean Walk is probably one of the best resorts in Daytona Beach, and with certain\u2026..\u201dcorrections\u201d\u2026. it could be one of the nicer resorts in the state. BUT\u2026 there are certain things that keep it from being the premier resort that I expected and like I have enjoyed elsewhere, and I am not sure that those \u201ccorrections\u201d can be effected. But let\u2019s start with the PROS ------- POOLS \u2013 Two outdoor, two indoor, one Lazy River (the four pools are a good size, Lazy River not such a good size) Water slide on one end of the pool area, kiddy play area (small slide, lots of sprinklers) on the other. BEACH\u2013 There is very little beach in Daytona that cars are NOT allowed to be on (Why anyone would want to sit next to their car while on a beach is beyond me, why anyone would want to sit by someone ELSE\u2019s car on a beach is beyond sanity) Fortunately, no cars allowed on this section of beach) ROOMS/SUITES \u2013 Spacious, nicely decorated, and well appointed (with the exception of surprisingly small TV\u2019s, in comparison with everything else \u2013 but we weren\u2019t there for the TV anyway) STAFF\u2013 Everyone we had dealings with was courteous and professional, though unlike other resorts we have stayed at, never felt anyone was \u201cpersonally interested\u201d in the guests OTHER leisure facilities \u2013 Well appointed exercise room, game room, pool table, computers, spa all on premises CONS ------- HOUSEKEEPING \u2013 non-existent during my stay. Over 50,000 Fairshare points to stay here, and didn\u2019t even get a \u201ctrash and tidy\u201d ONCE. FOOD \u2013 There is a coffee shop here; it is not table service, and quality is barely a cut above fast-food. One would think that a 4-star resort would have at least a 3-star restaurant. And the prices are ridiculous, for the quality. Four bucks for a hot dog with nothing (no fries, no kraut, no nothin\u2019) at the poolside grill, and it\u2019s bland as all get out. First high-end, \u201cfull service\u201d resort I have been to without a full serve restaurant. BEACH \u2013 Early every morning, a chair-and-umbrella rental place sets out their furniture across the entire width of the hotels beachfront, about 2 feet between set-ups, taking up the entire \u201cfront row\u201d of the beach (you know, the high tide line, the closest bit of soft sand to the water). They then wait to rent the set-ups to people throughout the day. If you are unable or unwilling to drop $25 for the day, or if you just prefer a sheet on the sand to a lounge and umbrella, you have to either go past the hotels boundaries, or sit behind the huge furniture, having it block your view of the water. Or sit in the wet sand in front of the furniture - not too comfy LIFEGUARDS \u2013 saw the highchairs, but never saw a guard on them during our entire stay. Not comforting with small kids, considering the strength of Daytona Beach currents. NOISE \u2013 EVERY day, for four hours in the middle of the afternoon (about 11 to 3) DJ\u2019s set up speakers about half the size of a Volkswagen, on a balcony in the center of the pool area. They play music, one of them sings to his own electric piano accompaniment (I would tell him \u201cnot to give up his day job\u201d, but it IS his day job ! ) and they blast the volume so loud that we could hear it way down on the beach, one hotel away. Poolside, you have to shout to have a conversation, except at the very far ends of the pool. I am not a loud music hater by any means, but these guys NEVER TAKE A BREAK. Those of us who like to be able to converse a bit don\u2019t get anytime at all during those 4 hours, which I think is grossly unfair. If one wants to hear music non-stop, and there is no DJ playing, one can always use an iPod, or walkman. If one wants to hear only the ocean, or your own conversation (or your kids calling for you from the pool?) there is no \u201ciPod for silence\u201d. All management would have to do to be fair to all is let the DJ take a break for 15 minutes an hour. (I talked to the DJ \u2013 management insists on non-stop music) ELEVATORS \u2013 Two towers. Approximately 300 rooms per tower. Only four elevators per tower. Do the math. (You\u2019ll have plenty of time while you\u2019re waiting for an elevator to arrive, or while riding up or down from a high floor.) CHECK IN. \u2013 Even if your room is ready, you will NOT be allowed to check in to your room before 4 pm. You can check in to the hotel earlier, and get your wristband to use the facilities, but you still have to go back to the desk at 4 pm to get your room card. The day we checked in, so did 238 other rooms. You can guess what the line was like. Makes no sense at all not to let people have their room early if it is ready when they arrive. CHAIR CONTEST \u2013 The pool deck closes for cleaning between 6 am and 8:15 every morning. At about 7:45, people start milling about (not lining up \u2013 MILLING \u2013 there\u2019s a difference \u2013 lining up implies order, courtesy, respect for first come first serve) the entrances to the pool area. At 8:15, the security guards \u2013 yes, SECURITY GUARDS \u2013 who have been keeping people off the deck step back, and the race for a chair is on. Within 3 minutes, all lounges and tables are saved. You wont be able to get one until late morning or early afternoon if you aren\u2019t there by \u201copening bell\u201d CROWDS \u2013 Despite all these great facilities, they DO NOT SUPPORT THE POPULATION. And this is not something that should be excused just because it was peak time; we ALWAYS travel at peak times (I work for the schools, and have two kids in elementary school \u2013 only take vacations at peak times \u2013 Spring Break, President\u2019s Week, etc) and this is the worst overcrowding I have seen anywhere, except possibly the Jersey Shore on 4th of July weekend. This place has been OVERBUILT. Too many rooms, the towers are too high (they also put the pool in shade by 1 pm, and the BEACH in shade by about 3:30 pm), and there is no feeling of spaciousness or leisure to the place; rather, it is more FRENETIC than relaxing. I guess that last bit is a Con more from Personal Preference \u2013 not everyone wants relaxation at a high-end resort, and The Crowd here certainly seemed to like the frantic pace. The general population here seemed not so much a Young Spring Breaker crowd - more like a Carnival crowd. Not seedy, but certainly more tacky than we are used to in a high-end resort.But I guess htis is not as high-end as I first believed.", "Date": "April 24, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "atlanta,georgia", "Title": "\u201cNice resort\u201d", "Author": "tropicalflorida", "ReviewID": "UR4976534", "Content": "This is a great resort.

That't it! Over a week ago I stayed at this hotel for five days 3.26.-3.31. After we checked in we noticed that the room was not properly inspected. First of all the one of the cabinet in the bathroom was missing, the roller blind (curtain) that was covering the washer and dryer were broken, the disposal waste in the kitchen was not working, since it was full of silverware and thrash. In addition the nightstand in the living room was missing a leg. Two hours after we checked in we called the front desk and put in a claim for replacing the little table in the living room. Unfortunately, it took over 3 hours and nobody showed up. Therefore we called again and they told us that next day someone form maintenance will come and replace it. On Monday morning someone from maintenance showed up, took the table, told us that we will get another one soon, but it never happened... On Friday after a very nice stay at the resort, and very wonderful vacation, we were sure that we would come back again. However, on the 4th of April my credit card was charged 430 dollars, and I really thought that was a huge misunderstanding! I called the hotel and talked to the clerk from accounting, they said that the charge was because of damage to the the room and they listed 4 things that were missing or broken, the missing cabinet in the restroom, broken stereo (that we never had in our room), broken curtain. I was told that I would be transferred to the manager but I was not. They said that the manager is busy, and can call me back, but it never happened. In addition, I requested the full list of the things that I was charged, but they refused. I also asked to send the list of the broken things to my email, but it never happened. Yesterday I claimed the dispute at the Bank for an unauthorized charge on my account. EVERYBODY!! Be careful, and after checking in properly inspect your room and call the front desk!

Parents had fun too!\u201d", "Author": "TonkaMom", "ReviewID": "UR4942367", "Content": "My husband and I and our 2 boys aged 16 and 17 stayed at Ocean Walk from March 29 - April 3. In general we had a good time. The kids had a blast! There were tons of other teens (espcially girls!) at the pool and on the beach, so our boys were not bored for a single second. The pool deck is open 22 hours (closes from 6 - 8 a.m. for cleaning) and has 24 hour security, so we let the kids stay out \"late\" with no worries. The OceanWalk Village area was \"crawling\" with Security guards and police, so we felt very safe. I guess there was more security than normal because of BCR weekend. We checked in on Wednesday, we were first in line and it still took 25 minutes to get checked in by a very flustered new employee. On Sunday the check in line stretched all the way from the lobby into the bar and it was taking some very upset people over 2 hours to check in! Apparently the resort had trouble getting the BCR revelers out of bed to check out - thus the delay in cleaning rooms and checking in new arrivals. We rented a lovely 2 bedroom oceanfront unit from the resort. We loved the floorplan - we had 2 of everying! 2 bedrooms, living rooms, kitchens, bathrooms and even 2 sets of washers and dryers. The kids really enjoyed having their own \"place\"! The unit was very clean, the furnishings were nice (except one sleeper sofa had seen better days)and the carpet was ripping out where it met the tile. The jacuzzi tub in the master bath was awesome and the jets weren't too loud. The oceanfront balcony was spacious and our unit was supplied with 10! plastic deck chairs. We did not have maid service during our 5 day stay - but we didn't really need it and didn't ask for it. I just assumed being we rented from the resort, we would automatically have maid service. However, we were supplied with a generous allotment of towels everyday, including extra large fluffy blue and white striped beach towels. When we made our reservation in December, we requested an upper floor unit. We were put in a unit on the 4th floor (which is the lowest!). Turns out we liked being on the 4th floor. Easy stair access to the pool and lobby and we had a great view of pool deck and beach so we could easily see what the kids were doing. My husband (who is recovering from 8 months of chemo) could sit on the balcony and enjoy the pool atmosphere without leaving the room. The only drawback was the noise at 7:00a.m. from the power sprayer used to clean the pool deck. The resort was booked full during our stay, but it never seemed too crowded. At 9:30 a.m. there was still a good selection of chairs by the pool - by 10:30 they were all taken. I didn't really observe a lot of \"reserving\" chairs that is mentioned in other reviews. The pools are beautiful, but we were grossed out by the huge(3 INCHES LONG!)bugs swimming in the pool. Someone said they were palmetto bugs. COCKROACHES that can swim and fly! Yuck! They were only in the South Tower pool with the slide. The North tower pool was bug free. We really enjoyed the Pool Bar and the cheeseburgers from the grill! On Thursday, we rented chairs and an umbrella ($25) on the beach. On Friday, Saturday & Sunday the vendor was not there, maybe because of BCR? See the concierge for restaurant resevations and lining up acitivities. She was extremely helpful! She lined up jet skis and street legal scooters for the kids from a great place on Ponce Inlet that has all new equipment! (Scooters were delivered to the resort. Kids skiied at Ponce Inlet and on the ocean - best ever!) A few notes of caution: 1.) Parents - watch your little ones! A 3 yr. old boy left his parents condo on his own! His parents were frantically trying to find him and after an hour of hell, security did locate him. This could have been tragic! 2.) Another little boy got his arm stuck in the elevator. It took several strong adults to pry the elevator doors open to free his arm. (It was badly bruised)Be aware - elevators can malfunction and can be dangerous! 3.) DANGER!!! WATCH FOR CARS!!! DRIVE SLOWLY in the parking ramp. On Monday, an elderly woman was hit by a car in the parking ramp. What a way to ruin your vacation! People drive way to fast and walkers need to stay out of the driving lanes. I can't emphasize this enough! Overall we had a great time at this resort and would definitely go again.

CONS - Now let me say - don't let this list overwhelm you...all in all our stay was very good. This is only to educate you ahead of time. During the entire week housekeeping never came once - I washed all the towels myself. They try to tell you the striped beach towels are \"for the week\"...no thanks ...I'm NOT going to take my sandy wet towel out in the morning and NO I'm not going to wash those too! Hospitality of staff was very inconsistent - some were VERY nice and some really didn't have a clue what was going on OR didn't really want to help. Pool with the waterslide was not heated and even in high 80 degree weather - you didn't find me in there...even my kids wouldn't go in! Lazy River was not heated and freezing too. By around early afternoon at least half of the pool area is shaded (including the kid's pool) so it is imperative that if you want a good sunny chair all day...get out of bed and get down there right when the pool opens at 8:15 ...no joke...people are lined up waiting. Get as close to the fence by the beach as possible for the longest sun. Tips - When parking in the garage go DOWN instead of up - there are always spots on the lower level and you can go right in the LL door and up the elevator. If you go during spring break (or during any major convention ie. Car Stereo Convention) just know that it's a bit crazy. Maui Nix Surf Shop was great (the big one down the street) a lot of great stuff and my husband rented a surf board for a few days from them. Beach - Chairs are not provided by the resort and are generally available by a vendor for $8/day (x 2 x5 to 7 days...lot of money when you are only spending maybe the afternoon on the beach because the pool is now shady). We bought cheap chairs and some sand toys. On the way out I asked people in line if they had children and passed down the sand toys to be enjoyed by other children. Restaurants - Highly recommend The Chart House...then Stonewood Grill and Inlet Harbor was fun (kid's had a blast in wooden ship they have to play in). Hope you find this helpful.

A good time to go as the high season crowd seem to have eased off. The Fairfield resort was more than we expected from some of the previous reviews we had read. We swapped our points to Ocean Walk to be close to the beach and have a quality experience. We had never been to Florida before so was somewhat nervous not knowing what to expect. The Fairfield staff from the front desk to check out were outstanding and helpful in every way. We had a wonderful unit facing onto the beach and pool area. We were on the 17th floor which gave us a fantastic view of the ocean and sea front, as well as away from any noise. We observed that the units on the reverse side of the facility had a nice view of the inland waterway and city, but you get what you pay for. This resort has most everything that an individual or family would want. You can have individual privacy on the beach or family fun with all of the in-house or local area activities. Attached directly to the resort is Ocean Walk which provides resturants and shops of diverse styles at reasonable prices. There are also many shops close by also within walking distance that provides for most of your needs. One problem which we experienced was the drive into the facility. It gets a bit crowded during the busy check in and out times getting the family, luggage unloaded, but the hotel staff attempts to process you as quck as possible, and provides good instructions as to parking and access alternatives once you are booked in. We read that problems were occuring at check in and with the resort elevators. We arrived about 3PM on Saturday and had no delays what so ever. For timeshare owners, and if you have a car, we recommend that you go to the Publix supermarket which is located about 2 miles north of the resort, to purchase your food and necessary needs. The hotel staff will give you specific directions, but it is easy to find. The hotel concierge staff were very helpful and provide some great advice and fantastic savings coupons for activities and resturants. Yes, during high activity periods, the elevators traffic did have some delays, a few minutes at most, but expected with the size of the facility and the number of patrons in the resort. One of the main attractions at the resort is the Lazy River tube float area. Fun for both children and adults alike. Also, the direct access to the beach from the resort is great with a shower rinse unit at the gate to clean off the sand. Let us highlight one point - there are safes in every facility for security of your personal property. We used the safe in our room, but forgot to remove our valuables upon checking out. Once we realized our problem the next morning, we quickly contacted the resort and they took quick positive steps to resolve our problem. They took proper steps to confirm who we were and went on to look into the problem. Within minutes they called back acknowledging that the possession were secured from the safe. The hotel security staff ascertained where we would like to have the items forwarded and took immediate actions to provide us with our items in a very timely and secure manner. The material was forwarded to us by overnight FedEx and we received all items within 24 hours. Wow!! What a relief and fantastice service by the Fairfield staff. Our thanks.

I had read some reviews that were less than positive so I was somewhat concerned about what we might be getting into. Those reviews were certainly not representative of our experience. First of all, the place is bigand very impressive! You can't miss it as you drive down the road. The staff was extremely nice and helpful with everything. Any questions, problems, etc. that we had, they quickly and gladly took care of us. Check in was easy...although we checked in on a Sunday, which I'm sure is a little slower than on Fri or Sat. Our 1 BR unit was very nice. We were in the South Tower which is the older one, but it was still a really nice place, with everything that we needed. While we didn't have a direct ocean view, we were on the side, so we actually could see both the ocean and the intercoastal. We were on the 16th floor, so it was a great view. It would be bad to have a street side, interior view...basically nothing to see but the street and parking deck. So if you can at all request an ocean front room, do it. Our kids had a blast the whole week. (ages 5 and 2). They were at the pools everyday. Due to the hurricane in the south, we had rain 3 days, but it certainly didn't stop my family. We were still outside for most of the time, you're already wet, what's a little rain??? At the times when it rained alot we just moved to the indoor pools. That is what is so great about this place as compared to many other resorts...there is always something to do rain or shine. Plus there is also indoor mini golf, an arcade, constant activities, computer rooms, etc... And as I mentioned the staff is great!! We only ate out a couple of times...with the fully equipped kitchen there really was no need to spend money dining out. But the 2 places we went were great. I highly recommend The Views, which is just a couple of blocks away on Seabreeze Blvd. It's a small place, but wonderful food and very good prices. Another night we went to Inlet Harbor Restaurant at the southern tip of the island. It was also very good food....mostly seafood, and very reasonably priced. DON'T order pizza from Napoli Pizza across the street....it's really not very good. There are plenty of other pizza places close by or that deliver. Also, Adobe Gila's at the Ocean Walk shoppes next to the resort wasn't anything special...basic bar food, not very good margaritas (served in a styrofoam cup?!?!?! - sacrilege!!) We didn't leave the resort to do any siteseeing....Daytona is still a pretty seedy place and there just didn't seem to be much to do with kids, that we couldn't already do at the resort. My husband and son did go to Daytona Lagoon WAter park across the street from the hotel. They voted it one of the best water parks they had ever been to. It wasn't at all crowded (remember this is September off-season) and they loved all the slides. There are some large mini-golf courses, the lighthouse, speedway, etc... if you want to venture out, and Kennedy Space Center is only 1 hour away (but it's a little pricey at $30 for adults and $20 for kids) Of course, Orlando...the land of long lines and price gouging... is only a short drive away...but we are putting that painful experience off a few years until our kids really beg to go. All in all, we really liked the Ocean Walk and would most likely return in the future...it's too bad it's located in Daytona and not a nicer beach town, but can't have everything. Definitely great for families!! The beach at Daytona is OK, but it has taken alot of abuse from the recent hurricanes, so they have", "Date": "October 10, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Inverkeithing, Fife, Scotland, UK", "Title": "\u201cOcean Walk is Just Wonderful for all the Family\u201d", "Author": "anneusa555", "ReviewID": "UR4003370", "Content": "I have been in numerous amounts of timeshare resorts in both America and Europe and this is by far the best.

Apparently, the resort was not fully booked. We pulled up to the exterior of the resort and saw about three cars waiting. I had read reviews of the staff being rude to those trying to check in early, but I decided that \u201cyou can\u2019t win if you don\u2019t enter\u201d, so I decided to see if we could get in 20 minutes early so we could go ahead and park. I was pleasantly surprised to walk into the very beautiful lobby to see that no one at all was waiting to check in! I had expected to see the hour-long line that I had read about and others had experienced. I walked right up to the desk (no line) and asked about checking in a little early. The lady was extremely nice and, with a lovely smile, immediately told me that my room was ready and that she would certainly go ahead and check us in. That was a great start to a great stay at Ocean Walk! Check in was quick, and soon we acquired a young bellhop named \u201cCharles\u201d who was very nice and treated us as if helping us was the only reason he came to work that day! We made polite conversation as I walked with him to our room as he carted our large amount of luggage; meanwhile, my husband parked the car in the south tower garage. He had no problems getting a parking spot. We left several times during our week-long stay and never had a problem getting a good spot (although I could see that if the resort was filled to capacity that it could be a problem). Be careful about walking/driving in the garages, though! Too many drivers are driving around the tight corners like they are the only ones there! Slow down, please! :-) We were blessed with an Ocean-front 1 Bedroom Deluxe on the 11th floor of the South tower near the back-end of the bandshell. We had room 1114 A and were thrilled with it. Upon entering, I gasped at how beautiful everything was and to see the ocean right outside of the sliding glass door. The unit was very clean with nothing missing, and the neat shapes that all the towels/washcloths were in made us almost not want to use them and mess them up! It was not perfect, but nearly so! The shower was a little tricky to get hot water from, but my clever husband figured it out and it worked (although I only used it once and enjoyed the hot tub the rest of the time); we had to turn the knob all the way on in one direction until the water pressure left and then turn it back the other way very slightly where there was a very small \u201cwindow of opportunity\u201d for hot water! (although not with as much water pressure as we\u2019d prefer). There was a stain on the carpet in one small area in the living room, but other than that, the blue carpet was very nice. You could see where a part of the microwave door had been broken and glued, but it wasn\u2019t an eyesore for me, just a close observation of mine. I loved the cheerful d\u00e9cor, the ocean-front balcony off of the living room was wonderful for watching fireworks from the pier and listening to a concert at the bandshell one evening. I enjoyed using the Jacuzzi nightly after my swim! There was never a problem with getting plenty of hot water for the Jacuzzi, by the way. The washer/dryer was a great help (I probably did 2 loads a day, our own clothing & freshening towels/swimsuits). The kitchen had all we needed for cooking and dining, and everything was in great shape. My husband and I thought that our King bed was very comfy, one of my sons comfortably slept on the queen sofa bed in the living room, and there was plenty of floor space in the living room for my other son to use his air mattress with sleeping bag. They are teen boys and will NOT sleep together! ;-) During the day, the air mattres was placed in the entryway closet out of the way. It was plenty of room for the 4 of us; we all loved our condo! I couldn\u2019t find any sheets/blankets for the sofa bed, so I called the front desk around midnight our first night there; they sent someone up within 15 minutes with clean sheets/blankets, which I thought was a reasonable wait. In everything, we found that we received wonderful service from the Ocean Walk staff! It was very hot during our stay, so doing anything outside other than swimming wasn\u2019t even a consideration for us. We loved being able to go to the 4th floor of the North tower to play putt-putt golf in the COOL A/C in the middle of the day when the sun seemed its hottest. This was free and a lot of fun for us. The resort offered many activities for all ages, but we opted to do our own thing for the most part. I think that a lot of people checked out during the weekend, so Sunday through Friday left the resort much emptier during our stay. Since the resort was not too full, the pools were never what I would call crowded. I don\u2019t know why, but pool wristbands were not used, nor given out during our stay. The lady at the front desk said that they weren\u2019t using them; I was glad for that! Some may have saved their pool chairs, but it was not very noticeable if they did; there were always some empty lounges (usually many were available). I do know that the pools were always open except between 6:45am and 8:15am (or sometime close to those times). During those times, they pressure-washed the pool deck (I watched them a few mornings) and there were no towels or other belongings anywhere near the pools or deck. If someone had gotten up before 6am to save a chair, either their stuff would\u2019ve gotten soaked or they would\u2019ve removed them (so nothing was ever sitting down there at that time during my stay). The beach was never crowded during our stay, and we loved the ease of going back and forth from pool to beach and vice-a-versa (there are showers & spickets to rinse the sand/salt off as you enter pool deck from beach). I loved the lazy river (never a line for it, but clearly very popular), although I did suggest on our comment card (that we turned in to the front desk) that there be periodic adult-only float times i.e. first 15 min. of every even hour. Kids can get really rowdy in the lazy river\u2026and it suddenly feels very UN-lazy during those times. There were some times that I could relax in the lazy river, although if it had been busier, I wouldn\u2019t think enjoying it would\u2019ve been as possible). We chose to attend a timeshare sales pitch our second day there and had a time window of being there anytime between 9am \u2013 3pm. It wasn\u2019t too bad and took about 90 minutes. We didn\u2019t buy, but thought that the $50 restaurant-of-our-choice gift card and 4 Free adult Daytona USA combo tickets (with track tour, worth over $30/person) were worth the time. There were several other choices in gifts available also. The resort never called us about attending, but we were pursued by a man in a Fairfield timeshare booth at the Ocean Village Shoppes. We had already planned on going anyway, so we didn\u2019t mind him asking us about it. All-in-all, we loved staying at the Ocean Walk Resort. My husband is pretty picky, and even he wants to go back whenever we take another beach trip! I could\u2019ve easily stayed 2 weeks instead of the 1 that flew by too quickly!

We had been scheduled to go to Playa del Carmen to an all inclusive resort that week, but the night before our departure (really the early morning hours of our departure date) the forecast track for Hurricane Emily caused us to cancel our Mexican trip. We were all extremely dissappointed, having planned and looked forward to the trip for a long time. We were packed and determined to go SOMEWHERE, and were fortunate to get accomdations at Ocean Walk in Daytona, a 2 1/2 hour drive from our house. We had a huge 2-bedroom beautiful apartment on the corner of the 24th floor in the north tower. It was ocean front, with amazing views of the ocean and down Atlantic Blvd. The master suite had a jacuzzi tub, king bed, nice sitting area. The other bedroom had two double beds, a walk in closet and another large bathroom. There was a washer and dryer and fully equipped kitchen, including a blender for margaritas. We could only have that room for 2 nights. We then had one 1-bedroom for two nights, and two 1-bedrooms for three nights. The bellhops were very helpful, and stored our things the day we had to move. They even stored the refrigerated items for us. The next unit was in the south tower, (a little older) but was on the 18th floor and was beachfront with amazing views as well. It was smaller, with two double beds in the bedroom, a pull out couch, but a fully equipped kitchen with bar, VCR, and a washer and dryer as well. The bathroom was a little smaller but still nice. We didn't have to move after two nights. We just added another unit which was on the 12th floor for the boys. The girls absolutely loved the resort. There were constant activities with the game room, putt putt golf, internet access, and video games. There were tons of teenagers and they made some friends. The 17 yr olds loved the location at the boardwalk, and loved the fitness room. The hotel connects to the shops at the Boardwalk, which was really convenient. There were live bands at the bandshell and fireworks several of the nights. The hotel is beautiful, with entertainment by the pool during the day. It was the closest thing to the all-inclusive resort we could have found in terms of activities for the kids and entertainment. We did have to play the \"towel game\" every morning to get a shaded spot by the pool. The security guards actually would not let anyone on the pool deck before 8:00 A.M. to reserve a spot, so what ended up happening was everyone waiting by the door (some actually kind of hiding in the bushes - really!!!) and then at 8:00 making a mad dash to get your preferred spot. We were lucky and were able to get shaded tables at the pool with views of the ocean every day. One man actually fell running to get a spot one of the days. He got back up though and did get his spot! I noticed people coming down around 9 still able to get chairs by the pool, but if it was much later than that, they were taken. I also noticed the beach in front of the hotel was really crowded, but we considered it a trade-off to put up with a more crowded beach in exchange for a full service resort with all of the activities and amenities it offered. If it were just my husband and I, I would opt for a condo on a less crowded, more laid back part of the beach. But with teens and preteens, they'd probably be bored and this resort fit their needs perfectly. They had movies for rent in the lobby. They had crafts every day, and board games, footballs, frisbees, boogie boards, etcetera that could be checked out at no charge. Worth noting is at The Eatery just off the lobby you can purchase a drink, and get free refills the rest of the day. They also have $1 soft ice cream cones, and reasonably priced blizzards that were deliciious. We deep sea fished. We parasailed just a few hundred yards down the beach, and Ocean Walk guests get a discount. The boys rented scooters to ride around town and the beach and had a blast. Bubba Gumps is a neat place with good food. We also like the North Turn restaurant down in Ponce Inlet. It's right on the beach and the food is good. We also played putt putt golf. There's plenty to do in the area. Next time we're going to rent a pontoon boat and go down the river. Check-in did take a while, and a few times the parking garage was over full, so people were parking in non-parking spots. Overall, I'd definitely recommend this resort for active families that like a lot of activity and want to be in the center of all the action. I'd recommend it over Adam's Mark, which is next door. But if you want a less crowded, more laid back atmosphere, I'd pick something in Ormond Beach or Daytona Beach Shores.

Now they have 2 outside huge pools and two buildings, so it has to be 10 times (if possible) better. There was an area by the lobby where you could buy reasonably priced and delicious smoothies. There was many activities and contests by the pool. There was bingo and different activities for all ages. Root beer floats and BBQ food was sold. The pools were HUGE, with a waterslide and a waterfall. You could walk out right onto the beach. There was even golf there. Perfect location too, because the resort is linked to Ocean Walk Village. Ocean Walk Village has many restaraunts. One was called Bubba Gumps based on the movie, and it was a great place to eat. It had trivia on the movie and funny sayings and great food and service, and was so well decorated. There is also Cold Stone Creamery, the world's greatest ice cream place. You can order custom ice creams with mix-ins, or use their own unique creations, and watch them make it. It is a bit expensive, but I think it is worth it. The rooms at Ocean Walk were terrific. We got a 2 bedroom condo. There was a beautiful ocean view/pool view. The rooms were very clean and colorful and cheerful. There was 2 fully equipted kitchen, 2 bedrooms-one with a king bed, and one with 2 twins or fulls, (I can't recall which), both with TVs. The 2 family rooms had TVs, a pull-put couch, and everything. It was all very comfortable . The bathrooms were very clean and were decorated with towels that were formed in a sort of origami way that looked very pretty.

We only had 6 people there, but it could fit up to 10 comfortably. The resort is very reasonably priced for what you get. By the pool, there is also a Lazy River, where you float around in inflatable donuts and just relax. Mothers especially love this.

Overall, we had a great stay, but we did run into some problems and inconveniences that diluted our experience somewhat. First of all, let's get this out of the way: Daytona Beach and the resort are both BEAUTIFUL. The Ocean Walk Resort is situated in a prime location on the beach, near the boardwalk and the Main Street Pier. It is connected to the open-air Ocean Walk Shops Mall and is a short drive away from both Publix and Winn-Dixie grocery stores. A few weeks prior to traveling to Daytona Beach, I spoke with a Fairfield representative who asked if I had any questions about the resort or my stay. I asked if they had any idea where in the resort we would be staying, since I have heard that there are SIGNIFICANT differences in room types based on whether you get a so-called \"A\" unit or a \"B\" unit, as well as which tower you are staying in (the north tower or the south tower). I was informed we would be staying in room 1822A, which is a great room with a great ocean view in the newer North Tower. When we arrived at the hotel at approximately 6:00 PM on Saturday, May 7, we were told we were in (I believe) Room 416 in the South Tower. I was somewhat confused because obviously this was not what I was told before. When we arrived in our room, we found it to be absolutely gorgeous, very spacious, with a whirlpool tub and very tasteful art-deco decorating. It also had two balconies, which overlooked... a parking deck and crosswalk for the outside mall. We were disappointed since we had gone to significant effort and expense to try to get a view of the ocean (this trip was the first time either of us had ever been to the ocean). When we called the front desk, we were rudely informed that there was nothing that could be done and that specific room assignments were not made in advance. We decided not to let our disappointment about the view ruin our vacation, and determined that the room itself was otherwise perfect and nicer than anywhere else we'd ever stayed before. An exploration of the hotel revealed a nice game room, an adults-only lounge, a computer room, an activity room for children, a small indoor mini-golf course, a gift shop, a well-equipped exercise room, an indoor golf practice area, two indoor pools, three outdoor pools, a lazy river, a poolside bar area, an indoor bar and a cafeteria-style cafe. There was also an area where an artist would draw portraits and characatures in one of the two lobbies and there always seemed to be some sort of activity going on, from a book sale in the lobby to a karaoke night at the bar. We were told upon checking in that we should visit the Concierge Desk for a \"free check-in gift\". Being hip to Fairfield's wily ways, we were well aware that this was a ruse to get us to attend a time-share pitch, but we thought we would humor them and see what was being offered. The deal on the table was gift certificates to various area restaurants in exchange for going on a tour of the hotel where we were staying and spending a couple hours telling a very insistent salesperson that we didn't want to buy a timeshare. It's debatable whether $60 worth of gift certificates is worth losing 2-3 hours worth of your time, but we went along with it and got the gift certificates without having to spend a dime. The salesperson was very phony and snooty, and the high-pressure tactics are very see-through to anyone familiar with sales techniques. The concierge desk was by far the most helpful aspect of the hotel. A very pleasant older lady with an accent (we sadly didn't catch her name) provided us with a lot of excellent information about local attractions and restaurants. ALL of her suggestions were spot-on and without her advice we probably would have missed out on some very memorable aspects of our trip. Her most helpful advice came when she was signing my fiance up for a complimentary Mary Kay spa treatment, and tried to automatically write down our room number as \"1822A\". Upon questioning her about it, it became evident that we truly WERE supposed to be in that room. After listening to our ordeal with the front desk, she provided a phone number to a man she said would do his best to pull strings to help us. And he absolutely did. This man listened to our problem and contacted the hotel manager, who contacted the night manager with instructions to move us to room 1822A. We were moved that evening, by the same man who had told us he couldn't move us! Our second room, then, was in the newer tower. It had a different decorating scheme and was even more gorgeous than the first room (both were one bedroom suites). The kitchen and dining area were larger and the view of the ocean from the 18th floor was absolutely breathtaking. We truly had no complaints whatsoever about the second room. We could see the beach, the boardwalk, the outdoor pools, the bandshell, the pier, and ocean as far as the eye could see, not to mention spectacular sunrises. We went to Saint Augustine one of the days of our trip, and the conceirge desk was helpful in that respect once again, providing plenty of brochures and coupons for attractions in the area, and providing advice on the best sites to see while we were there. The concierge also informed us of the Sterling Casino Cruise Line, which is basically a casino on a huge cruise ship that sails three miles off Florida's coast. The trip is about four hours and features table games, slot machines (even nickel slots), several lounges with great live entertainment, a free deli buffet, free drinks, and a great experience on a real cruise ship. There are a couple of cruises per day -- I recommend the sunset cruise, which was about 8 to midnight. The ship leaves from Port Canaveral, which is about an hour away from Ocean Walk -- but a shuttle bus takes you to and from the dock, so you don't even have to worry about driving (and you have a ready-made designated driver). The entire cost of all this: the shuttle, the cruise, the buffet, the entertainment, everything... is $5.00 per person. And you are not required to gamble, either. Neither me nor my fiance are gamblers: we only gambled with $20.00 for the whole night and finished down about five or six bucks. But we had a great time and you just couldn't beat it for the price. The beach outside the resort is perfect. The ocean is a great time also, but just be aware that when the sun starts setting behind the buildings you have to chase the sunlight if you're laying out in the sun. Another thing to keep in mind if you go swimming out into the ocean: stay aware of the riptide warnings, which are posted on the back of the lifeguard chairs. The currents can be extremely strong, particularly at high-tide. A wave hit my fiance and I out in the ocean and the riptides pulled us quite a distance from shore. My fiance is not a strong swimmer and although I am, the riptide was stronger than both of us. My fiance was in quite a bit of trouble and I was having a difficult time trying to help her. Luckily, the lifeguards are very alert and observant and quite good at what they do and tragedy was averted. The boardwalk area is fantastic. I haven't been to other boardwalks so I cannot compare this one to anything, but this boardwalk was quite fun. It is lined with eateries, ice cream shops, gift shops, arcades and other attractions. We managed to win enough tickets playing skee ball to get a nice souvenier shot glass from one of the arcades. All-in-all, Daytona Beach is a great place to vacation and the Ocean Walk Resort is a fantastic place to stay. The extremely friendly, genuinely helpful people at the resort seem to more than make up for the somewhat rude, unhelpful people on the staff. And as for the rooms, the location, and the amenities -- they are top notch. There is a good chance we may return to this resort on our next trip to Daytona Beach. -- BBR", "Date": "July 6, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Unknown", "Title": "\u201cOnly Place to Stay In Daytona\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3577798", "Content": "We absolutely love the Ocean Walk!!!

My daugther and her roommate from college made the trip with me. We flew into Daytona Beach and had the best time. The staff at the Ocean Walk were Great. And the girls walking every day around the outdoor pools (offering drinks) was a nice touch! You can't go to the beach without getting a Pina Colda!!!

We took our 15 year old son, 17 year old daughter, and 24 year old daughter with us. We have 4 children and we faithfully take a vacation every year. Through the years we have always looked for something the children would enjoy and every year we come back more exhausted than when we left. Trying to entertain 4 children and fight the long lines and traffic left us drained! This year was different though. When we parked the car in the parking garage, it didn't move until we left for home. Everything we needed was right there! One evening it was to the movies, one shopping, playing games in the arcade room, playing gooney golf, swimming, dining at really good places and much more. Our room was a 2 bedroom oceanfront and it was fantastic! We had 3 balconies all ocean view, two bathrooms, 2 refrigerators and stoves, all the utensils you could ever use. It was quiet and super clean. Around 9:00 am every morning maid service was there to clean our room and restock it and they did an excellent job. No one bothered us the whole time we were there. The only complaint I would have is they give you no layout of the hotel. I had studied the hotel out and knew they had alot of activities but didn't have a clue to where they were. So we began to explore and asked a security person, which was not helpful at all. We returned to the main desk and they said they didn't have anything to show the layout. We then found another desk where a lady that apparently sales their time share, gave us the information after asking us if we would be interested in buying. She did not pressure us after that and answered all our questions. All the game rooms and activities were on LL (lower lobby) the golf supplies are checked out on LL but the actual game is on the 4th floor. The fourth floor is also the exit hall to the movie theater and shops. We had the best experience with our vacation this year than ever before. We came home rested and can't wait to go back again!

My wife and I stayed at the Ocean Walk the week of May 7 - 14th. First, I think people need to remember they are staying at Daytona Beach not South Beach and are paying $140 a night instead of $400. If you keep this in perspective then you will be very happy with the Ocean Walk Resort. Our room was very nice and most importantly clean. We had a 1 bedroom in the south tower it was big almost like a one bedroom apartment with a kitchen and small washer and dryer. One downside was the housekeeping. Their did not seem to be any consistency the only thing I know they did in our room was replace the towels otherwise I don't think they did anything. I have read many people complaining about the pool, so let me give you some advice. First, you do have to go down and reserve a chair before around 9 AM if you want to have a chair that is going to be in the sun until 3 PM. I recommend the chairs lined along the fence next to the beach at the south tower pool. These chairs stay in the sun until at least 3PM, chairs closer to the hotel start getting shade around 1 to 1:30. If you want sun all day just go down to the beach. If you do go to the beach you have to pay $25 to rent chairs, umprella etc. The vendor is on the beach. Life guards do keep an eye on everyone just making sure they don't get to far off of shore. Finally, this is a family resort. If you came to get away from kids then this is not the resort for you. Remember more than half the units in this resort are time shares so families do come to these places to stay. Plus you are only 60 miles from Disneyworld once again a good reason why their are so many kids at the resort. My wife and I don't have kids but still managed to relax and have a great time. You will love the resort if you don't let the little things bother you and remember you are at the beach so life could be worse.", "Date": "May 16, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Round Lake, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cNot that great!\u201d", "Author": "Kristen0599", "ReviewID": "UR3473195", "Content": "We just returned from this resort...first of all do not make your reservations with the 800 number. I called on 3 different occasions with various questions prior to booking and was hung up on twice when I said I was not ready to book at that particular time. I found the representatives to be very rude! I finally booked thru a timeshare owner and got a great deal on a 3 bd 2 ba in the north tower. So, now with the resort itself.... if you are looking for a lot of action than this is the resort for you. If you are wanting something a little quieter and less crowded, do not stay here. The pool area is packed! We had an oceanfront room and at 8:30 a.m. I would look down at the pool area and most of the chairs were already taken. We did the beach the entire time and then hit the pool after 5 when it started to clear out. Also, the pool area is in the shade by 2:00 so if you want some sun you will need to move to the beach. The resort had a horrible odor. It seemed like they needed to use a lot of fragerance in order to mask an already existing odor problem. The other thing I didn't like is that in the master bedroom you only have a window (does not open) so you cannot lie in bed at night listening to the ocean. The room itself was ok. We had come from a very nice resort in Cape Canaveral so it was difficult to go to this resort. The beach is ok. The sand is brownish/red not your nice white sand. They have miniture golf (inside). It is not anything great but something to do at night. It is too bad they did not put it outside though, being indoors, coming from Chicago, was the last thing I wanted to do. Now, for a few of the positives, there is a lifeguard in the general vicinity of the resort and that was comforting to me since I have 3 small children. Trust me the lifequards stayed busy pulling people in from the rip currents. The boardwalk shops were nice to go to at night. We made \"Coldstone Creamery\" our treat at night.

We were arriving separately due to the fact I was just returning from Iraq. The room was paid for in cash including a cash deposit. After I waited in a very short line for almost 30 minutes, I was rudely greated by the staff. No greating what so ever. All she said was I need your credit card. I explained to her everything was previously paid for including the deposit. I need it for identification. I explained I would give her any picture ID she needed but she didn't need my credit card for identification. After that went on for some time the manager stepped in, needless to say I did not have to give my credit card. This was after a 20 minute dispute. We were supposed to have an OF room but didn't.

Even though there were several other cars out there, I was not blocking the flow of traffic. I asked were can I move it to? His response was I don't care just move it. There were teenagers in the pool after 11pm practically having sex and drinking in the pool; cursing up a storm. There were no remotes for ANY of the 3 TV's in the room and when we requested them they said they should be in there and couldn't give us any. Parking was atrocious.

The other times we would walk the beach or swim or sit by the ocean in our chairs and periodically check the pool area. We found chairs each day eventually and every day sat by the pool for 1-1/2 to 2 hours. By 3 pm the entire pool area is shade. The nice thing about the pool is the DJ playing music and the bartender service. But nothing beats the sound of ocean waves.

The resort is beautiful and well taken care of, with highly courteous, accommodating and professional staff. We were in the newer north tower, on the 22nd floor, in a 2 bdrm unit, with a full south exposure and a view over the top of the south tower. We could even see the flashing Ponce Inlet Lighthouse from our 2 balconies, and enjoyed watching those brave souls bobbing in the slingshot rides on the Boardwalk. Absolutely gorgeous view! Absolutely the best room! Sunrises from the s/e balcony and on the windy days, from the living room sofa. Sunsets from the s/w balcony. When we arrived at 4 p.m. on the Sunday, Bike Week was coming to a close, and the resort was busy, but we had no delays in checking in. Busy on Atlantic Ave. though. Pedestrians were moving faster than the motorists. What a hoot! It was like a county fair, complete with a variety of clowns. Bikes decorated, and a wide range of attire. But everyone was well behaved. We didn't even know they were on our floor - very quiet, even though many didn't check out until the Monday and Tuesday. By the end of the week, the Spring Breakers had arrived. That's when the rudeness and disrespectful behaviour really came out. Someone had vomitted in the one elevator (4 elevators in the north tower), but it was cleaned up before our family went out for breakfast. But honestly, it takes more than a good cleaning to try and get rid of that odour! And the Breakers sometimes carrying around alcoholic beverages, including beer bottles and glass containers in the lobby areas. I was glad my two sons witnessed some of the behaviour. Perhaps it will disuade them from the same when they reach that age. The only problem we had was with our room lock. Once we came back and housekeeping had left our door ajar. So we called security, and found nothing out of place, but since then, our key passes wouldn't work, and neither would their main key. So they had to replace the entire mechanism, which also went faulty later on in the week. We were locked out 3 times, but the staff were very accommodating and helpful. It certainly didn't hold us back from enjoying our holiday. We ate out most of the time, but did have breakfasts in our suite, and dinner two evenings. Everything is there for your cooking needs. But you do have to purchase everything down to the salt and pepper if you choose to cook in your room. They even provided the laundry soap, and I used it before we ventured off on our second week to St. Pete's Beach on the Gulf side of Florida. The Ocean Walk Shoppes next door were wonderful also. Visiting Starbucks every day was excellent. Went to the movies in the 10-theatre complex on our one rainy day - very comfortable reclining seats. Ate at Adobe Gille's - enjoyed the Lizard Legs (chicken wings) and many other mexican/pub fare items. Kids loved the Harley Davidson store, and the Maui Nix store. The Bandshell was also a great place. Enjoyed the music of the U.S. Air Force Band during one evening. Walking the Boardwalk to the Pier was a historical time-warp, with the sidewalk stones telling the history of the automotive and motorcycle racing on the Beach. And the stores/venues on the Boardwalk were right out of the 1950's. Really great! Even though the weather was cool, we did enjoy the indoor and outdoor pools, and one of the 3 outdoor jacuzzi's (before the Breakers took them over). The games room/arcade and the internet access in the lower lobby was a big hit for the kids.

We rented from a broker for a heck of a discount. Stayed Mon Feb,21st in a 2 bedroom in the new tower and the next 4 nights in a 2 bedroom in the old tower. Total cost was about 90 dollars a night. The suites were 1300 square feet. The first one was very luxurious with a side balcony. The one in the old tower was equally as nice but the furniture wasn't as nice, but it had an oceanfront balcony. The furniture was still much nicer than in any regular hotel Ive ever stayed at. The units have full kitchens and washer/dryer too plus jacuzzis. 2 bathrooms. Awesome pools. Absolutely the best place in the area. With all the activities and things for the kids to do we saved a ton of money that we would normally spend taking the kids to the parks,etc.....We also did a little grocery shopping and saved a ton on eating out as well. There is no construction whatsoever going on at this resort. One building next to the new tower is being refinished but doesn't affect this place at all. The Hilton at Ocean Walk is on the other side of the Ocean walk Village and that is being remodeled. I huess it was just purchased by Hilton and maybe people giving reviews are confusing the 2 places, but from what I saw most of the Hilton looked great too. Fairfield definitely has more to offer for kids and families though. The only time we were approached about a timeshare was by someone on the beach trying to get us to tour the Royal Floridian. Fairfield guest services left a card on our door offering a tour but we were never asked by anyone. On the last day we were there it was cloudy and rainy and we wanted a peek at the penthouse so we called them and set up a 45 min tour which turned into an hour but there was no pressure to buy and we got a 60 dollar meal at Ponce Inlet for it. As far as the 1 bedroom B units, some of them do face the hall but they are still lovely and remember that its a one bedroom studio not a condo. Just one more thing....In the older tower #1 only about 20% of the rooms are actually owned by Fairfield and the others are individually owned and rented by others so any poor service complaints may be due to who they rented from. We loved it and would definitely return there.

Had originally looked on internet for booking a room and found it through Expedia. Thinking I could get a better deal directly w/ this hotel , I called.

It was on the 18th floor directly looking over the beach and ocean. When you first walk in the rooms, it gives one a feel of a small Bermuda design. Soft yellow walls w/ tile floors. As soon as you walk in the room,you are in a small but quaint foyer,with a small table with a light.As you go around the corner it opens into a big room, with a fully equipped kitchen. In front of the kitchen divided by a small 1/2 wall is the living room with tables, and 2 fold out couches, tv,phone, and a balcony of 8X4,accessible via a sliding patio door. There are two entrances into the bedroom, which is its own room with in itself. Has big closet, window over looking ocean/beach, a Jack and Jill bath with full size \"jaccuzi\" tub, and a seperate single sink bath with walk in shower,toliet,etc.. It was extremely clean and had a room safe and iron/board in closet. The outer hall by kitchen has its own stackable washer and dryer along w/ 2 small boxes of Tide detergent. Each bath had own towels,plus additional in closet. Small extra blankets and pillows also avail. Over all, great beach feel, and you feel very welcome. The lobby is next to elevators, and accessible with no problem. There is a \"u \" shaped bar, made of dark wood, and always staffed. Check in was ok, Arrived at noon, knowing ck in was at 4pm. Was told room would be ready at 2. Had lunch at the pool,cked on room at 3, still not ready, but hey... I was early. At 4 room not ready, but went to VIP area of ck in as bartender told them I was coming over. They said, the room had been ready since 1pm, it was a computer glitch. I was fine, as the extra time let me enjoy the pool area,sun and more drinks. Got a free drink at bar for mistake. The next day, came back from being out, and room key would not work. Went down, stood in ck in line for 20 minutes, so I thought, I'd try VIP line again, they stated the key to room was malfunctioning, and reset it immediatly. There was never a time that I was pressured into looking at a time share as others mentioned. I did find it \"quirky\" that a magician was trying to get you to come over to his table of tricks in the lobby, I am sure to hook one on the time share. Never ate here, but has a small cafe attached to bar. Went to the Hilton for breakfast buffet. Otherr than that, all pools,2 hot tubs and lazy river were working. There is a hugh work out room.

Prior to this we stayed 3 nights at the Caribbean resort at Disney and afterwards we stayed at the Ritz Carlton on Amelia Island and I can honestly say that we enjoyed our stay here the best of the three. First off, we had rented a 1 BR,1 bath unit from Hotels for $94 a night and we were upgraded at no cost and with no request from us to a 2 BR, 2 bath unit (Rm 432-ask for it) it was absolutely stunning! The North tower was just opened in Feb. 2004 so it is still in great condition. My husband and son both have asthma and allergies and they had no trouble at all staying in this unit. The decor was very tastefully done, I especially enjoyed the use of the Jacuzzi tub after three days at Disney, and having a full kitchen and washer/dryer was very helpful. We had 2 separate balconies both with views of the ocean and the intercoastal waterways. No one bothered us about listening to any timeshare info and we were able to walk to the ajoining shops and movie theater(very nice) thru the hotel. The putt putt course is complimentary(4th floor) and they have daily activities including some cute ones for the kids including sand castle building which we were able to enjoy along with our 6 year old son. The pool was a little cool but refreshing after sitting in the Florida sun, the slide was fun and the lazy river was great too. We were fortunate to come in a off season time and just before \"bike week\". I can see where parking would be a problem during high traffic times of the year. We were there the week before bike week was officially going to start but the Orange County Chopper guys (Paul Sr. and Jr and Mikey Tuttle) were staying at this resort when we were there along with Steve Tyler from Aerosmith so this should tell you what a nice place this is.

I was very careful to read all of the reviews posted on this site, the good, the bad and the ugly and I took it all to heart. First we booked our reservation directly with the resort. That is the only way to get a straight answer on what kind of room you will be in. I was given a room number and a floor at booking and was told it could change, but it did not. We had two double beds on the 4th floor over looking the pool and the beach. That floor also goes directly out to The Ocean Walk Shops and has a back entrance to the pool. The only draw back was the constant stream of prospective condo owners that were courted every day by the staff. You will most likely receive a call to come to one of the meetings with the promise of food and drink gift certificates, but we respectfully declined and were never bothered again. We arrived at 6:00 PM on a Saturday night and had NO wait at check in. I found the check-in staff to be very helpful. We even extended our stay by one night and had no problems. If I could make a suggestion, I would say that you need to bring push pins or make some sort of make shift curtain to cover the window in your bedroom that faces the hallway. Thanks to the previous postings, I was able to cover ours with sheets, which helped block out the light. Also, it is true that you have to get up around 7:00 AM to put towels out on the chairs to get a spot at the pool. Management says \"No reserving chairs\", but everyone does it, so if you don't play the game, you will find yourself without a chair. We did see a fight between two families regarding \"moving their stuff\", but the hotel quickly accommodated the family that had saved the chairs earlier. Just know that you do take the chance of having your belongings moved aside, but this was the only case we saw in 7 days. Also bring extra laundry detergent if you plan on washing your own beach towels (I would bring my own beach towels), they do provide you with small amounts of detergent along with paper towels, trash bags, etc. , but we did the wash before returning home and ate breakfast in frequently, so we found it helpful to bring extra items. Light maid service is provided each day (taking out the trash, making beds and exchanging towels for clean ones). Our vacation was fabulous. The pool, water slide and lazy river were great, and we were within 45 minutes to 1 hour of Orlando, so we were able to go to Sea World for the day without a long drive after. Basically there is an element of uncertanty whenever you travel.

I have just a couple of somewhat negative remarks - there was sometimes a small wait for the elevators (the longest, probably 10 mins., when a storm blew in and the beach and pool deck were quickly closed causing everyone to need an elevator at the same time...the pool deck fills early so get there early if you want a chair...the parking garage can fill quickly in the evening (we never had a problem finding a spot, but there were several cars parked in non-spaces by the morning.)

After the first couple of days, we gave in and played the game. The beach was very clean and the ocean wonderful. My experience with the staff was good, no problems. We were there during a very busy time, June 26 - July 3, but didn't have any problems. This resort is very active, so if you are looking for a very quiet area you might not want to go. I had four teenagers so they had a blast with all there was for them to do. Oceanwalk shoppes were great and the pier also. I made a point of calling ahead to make sure of what kind of room I was getting because I had read other reviews. Was NOT dissappointed, it was a very enjoyable vacation and hope to be able to go back.", "Date": "July 6, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Unknown", "Title": "\u201cGood luck!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2265810", "Content": "You don't always get what you pay for! I called to confirm reservations 3 different times and was assured I was getting this great brand new 1 bedroom condo. NOT!! Management couldn't care less. Sorry but all our rooms are full!! What a mess and we weren't the only ones dissapointed. The condo was very dirty and had big stains on the carpet. Brown gunk all over the kitchen wall, chairs, and mold in the bath. I was so dissapointed. As far as the pool deck goes that was great. Wonderful pools and great beach. Bad customer service. I begged for towels and never did get them so I had to wash the ones we had and I couldn't find anyone in housekeeping that speaks English. I do not have any desire to stay here again especially at these prices. Check-in don't be in any hurry and have plenty of other activities to do while you wait for your room. Some other people I spoke with had a great room. I guess it's the luck of the draw.

We had a great 1 bedroom ocean front room. The full fridge made breakfast and lunch very convient. My biggest complaint is that chairs by the pool were very hard to get. I don't know what time people got up to save the chairs but we would go down at 7:00am and there would not be a chair to be found. This should be stopped. Also the pool is in the shade by 3pm but I went there for the beach anyway. I would recommend this hotel for a Daytona stay. But would say that there are alot better places to go than Daytona Beach.", "Date": "July 1, 2004"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Wyndham Ocean Walk", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g34172-d549344-Reviews-Wyndham_Ocean_Walk-Daytona_Beach_Florida.html", "Price": "$143 and up*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">300 N.
