Hotel staff were great, not that we really had much dealings with them everything was perfect. Breakfast was breakfast, no worse than many hotels I have stayed in, buffet style help yourself. It can be noisy when the valporetta are picking people up, dropping them off or being moored for the night, but we slept with the windows open, guess if you have walked enough during the day you can sleep through anything.

I've read reviewers complaining about the breakfast but I can't see how you can complain when its included FREE in the room rate. That being said there is a selection of cereal, bacon, eggs, cold meats, cheeses, breads, sweet breakfast pastries, fruit, juice, coffee...so you should be ok!!!

I realize this is a bit dated, but I meant to review earlier. After searching all the reviews and tips on Trip Advisor, I booked the Hotel Gabrielli for our stay in Venice. We were a little nervous having never been to Italy before, but were very happy once we arrived. A water taxi took us from the airport to almost directly in front of the hotel. The hotel is older and a bit small, but we loved the atmosphere and location. Check in was super easy, and our room looked directly over the water. Perfect views! The hotel offered breakfast in the indoor courtyard every morning. Everything was in immediate walking distance, St Marco Square, Rialto Bridge, museums, shopping, etc. We walked everywhere, so bring good walking shoes. One of our favorite moments was the gondola ride through the canals. Sounds cliche, but you have to do it!

The only possible good thing about this hotel is its location, near several vaparetto stops and right on the shoreline. (But the very same can be said of many other hotels right beside it, choose THEM!) But other than this every other experience at this run down and awfully expensive hotel was bad. The front desk staff (no smiles) was condescending and quite brisk, I did not know if this was because we are Asians or if they are like this in general. There was no free wi fi and the hotel had no complimentary internet points either- it was 2 Euros for the first 15 mins at their computer. With no other options you are forced to pay up. The entire hotel had a shabby, dusty and run down look about it. Now comes the room, cracks all over the walls and ceiling and barely space enough for 2 people to move, it was a disappointment for the outrageous rates they charged per night. The bed was so small that my husband (who is 6 feet) could not even stretch himself properly. It was 2 single beds joined together hence the middle parting made for an uneasy sleep; I fell out twice during the night when trying to turn over. The ancient AC did not work properly and we kept waking up to adjust the temperature as it was very hot in Venice in September. There was no tea/coffee ingredients in room which is not expected when you claim your hotel to be a 4 star. It most definitely was NOT. The breakfast was basic and breads were stale and old, as were the cheese. The toilet was adequate with a good shower but very dimly lit. The room came with a tiny balcony overlooking the canal which had a sideways view of the ocean- small but still it was nice to sit outside and people watch after sunset.

I have stayed at this Family's hotel in M\u00c3\u00b6lln (Hotel Waldhof auf Herrenland) a few times (Which is now owned by one of their daughters - Francesca). Francesca has done extensive renovations on the Hotel in M\u00c3\u00b6lln, and I must say, it used to be this old Italian/German style of hotel, and now its a majestic mix of old meets new. The right amount of character and old world charm, with comfortable and modern features. This is what their Hotel in Venice needs. The hotel in Venice is beautiful! Marbel floors as you walk in, old venician feel, beautiful courtyard that serves daily breakfast (with GREAT latte's!). The rooms are very old looking. I would say it does looks like they are trying to keep this old world feel, however it really isnt very appealing. As we were there, I was told the washrooms had all been redone these past few years. They were VERY VERY nice. Again marble, very clean and sophisticated look. If only the rest of the furniture was like this. The hotel restaraunt is also amazing! However from the outside you would never guess.. Their patio furniture is dingy and absolutely needs upgrading. I say let Francesca have a go at this hotel. If she can do what she did in M\u00c3\u00b6lln, they would have a 6star hotel on their hands. It's in a great location, just a 5 minute walk to the main plaza, and shops, stores and restaraunts. The views from the hotel are amazing! Little secret is to head all the way to the top of the hotel and get a view of the fireworks from the roof top terrace.

When he opened the curtain the view made it all worth while as the view summed up the best of Venice. As I was travelling on my own I had been expecting a pokey little room but it was a good size with very high ceilings which made it appear larger and the bed was huge. The rest of the furniture was limited but I didn't really need much and there was a sink in a \"cupboard\" as well as a decent sized bathroom. The room was quite warm but manageable. At night there was some noise from the boats nearby rocking in the water against their moorings but I still slept soundly (A day in Venice does that) Breakfast was in an internal garden which was very pleasant and there was a good choice though I was left to really find my way around. I forgot there was a roof terrace but the view from the view was enough. There is a water bus stop nearby and it is close to St Marks though after a long day it did seem further walking back.

I had a tiny prison cell like room where i could hardly move around in with my bag! however that made the room more cosy & the sleep quality amazing.

Carry lots of water to the room because i did not find any traces of a minibar or water in the room. Which deffy saved me some money! Water can be bought from the vendors on the street along the water.. Bathroom was deffy a disaster and needs the most serious renovation with a stinky plastic curtain separating the super tiny shower with the rest of the bathroom.

It is in a great spot, near Saint Marks Square with all the hussle and bustle, but also close to the quiet side of town with the Castillo.

The bathroom had a bidet right opposite the toilet, which was a bit disconcerting, but the room was very clean. It was very hot and the air con was rubbish, but we had shutters so closed them and kept the windows open. Breakfast had lots of choice including scrambled eggs and bacon, although not necessary all to the British taste ie. cake, cheese etc. All in all a lovely hotel with a nice feel to it. My only criticism would be that it didn't advertise its dinner menu in the rooms and it wasn't very attractive so we ate elsewhere. Possibly could do with making it a feature to keep guests there to eat and drink. Oh, almost forgot... the hotel has the most amazing roof terrace overlooking the whole bay. You can order down to the bar for drinks and stay up there until 11pm watching the sun set and the lights and boats on the grand canal.. Be warned before you go...it is very expensive in Venice. We had two rounds of drinks and 2 bowls of chips costing 49 Euros!!!!! Other tourists were questioning bills in restaurants as they were very steep.

Since we were not going to be in town too long, we decided that we didn't need to spend a fortune on a hotel. I have to admit that based on some of the reviews that I read about this hotel before we left, I was pretty nervous about it. Here's a realistic, honest review of the hotel... 1. This hotel is easy to get to. We followed the suggestions on the hotel's website to find our way there. Santa Lucia train station to vaporetto #1 (the slower one that lets you take in a good view of the Grand Canal), we exited at the Arsenale stop. As the website suggested, this took about 40 minutes or so. The hotel is located very close to this vaporetto stop. This is one reason I would recommend someone stay here. Of the 3-4 cities we went to in Italy, Venice definitely appeared to be the one where it was ok to be openly lost. You always read in travel guides things like \"look at your map discreetly...\"- not in Venice. We had large backpacks & I would have gotten tired of weaving in & out of the Venice streets trying to track down my hotel. If you want something that's easy to find, consider this hotel. It's a very convenient walk to Piazza San Marco. Overall location is the key when it comes to this hotel. 2. Age of hotel- The \"this place is old & not in a good way\" comment that I read before I left freaked me out. Yes, it's an older hotel but in a way you get what you pay for. Sure a new bedspread might spruce the place up a bit & the bed was kind of hard but overall there's really nothing wrong outwardly wrong with the hotel. I admit that when we first got there & in to our rooms I was a little weirded out but after some time I settled down. Again, for a night or two I think you'll be just fine. 3. Breakfast- I'd read that the hotel breakfasts in Venice were pretty low key. I would agree. It was nice to have a little something to eat in the morning, but don't expect anything too big. There were only two issues that kind of gave me a negative feeling about this hotel. Once during our stay we stopped in to grab something from our room on our way out of the hotel we walked past the concierge's desk. He left his post for a minute to go talk to someone. There, sitting on his desk, was someone's Mexican passport. Now when you check in to this hotel they ask you to leave ID (rather than just photocopying your passport like some of the other hotels we stayed at did). We didn't really want to give up our passports so we just gave them our driver's licenses. Now that had my passport sitting unattended I would have been furious. It would have been easy enough for someone to swipe it. This certainly could have been an isolated incident- but it wasn't good. I was also was a little thrown off when we asked if we could store our luggage with them for an afternoon before we left town. They said yes & directed us to a separate room where they keep luggage. There's no door, no lock, it's just a little alcove where you can leave your luggage. Again, I'm sure that overall they keep an eye on who is going in that area but it was not really as secure as I would have liked it. My husband reassured me that there was a room full of luggage & it would be fine. All in all if you'd like to spend your time & money exploring Venice not just sitting in your hotel room then this is the place for you.", "Date": "May 2, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "USA", "Title": "\u201cHORRIBLE!

Reception is handsome (beautiful floors and ceilings) although the bar looks like it was added in a fit of bad taste in the peachy 80s.

The bathroom was decorated with mushroom tiles and the TV in the room was exceptionally compact. The window overlooked a wall. I went back to reception and asked if there was another room available. The receptionist rolled his eyes at me and said 'like what?' I replied, 'like a room that resembles the ones on the website?'. I duly was shown a room 4 times the size of the previous one, with a superking bed, a chaise longue, a bigger-albeit shiny poo brown cracked tiled- bathroom and an overview of the afore mentioned sparrow infested courtyard. It was much better and air conditioned although still elderly and past it's day. On the plus side, there was a terrace that overlooks the water (although you have to go down 4 flights to the bar if you want to order anything) and the concierge service was very good. Food in Venice is more expensive than the posh end of London, but, on the whole very nice. We went to a recommended fish restaurant and had the tasting menu which was gorgeous and on the second night, we ate at the Barbican, a tiny 800 year old pub, which was beautiful.

Old, not so much rundown. my room was small and had the bare essentials. there's lots of room for storing clothes but the room is tiny and bare. Our room was off a small courtyard and the windows opened onto it. Outside of the room, the hotel was quaint. The hotel is quite large with many rooms. We didn't need the room with the view since we had the rooftop. That's a plus. One thing i didn't like was THEY LOCK YOU OUT OR IN, DEPENDS HOW YOU LOOK AT IT...AT MIDNITE. they pull this huge gate over the entrance and you have to stand there and ring the bell for what seems like eternity before someone comes, ANNOYED to let you in. meanwhile i had to go to the bathroom because there's none around especially after midnite. I don't know if its the graffiti they are worried about or what but i want to be able to enter my hotel at 2 AM. not stand outside for even 2 minutes!! Some hotels have a buzzer systems or a card key to open the door. But this huge gate?? Other then that I liked the hotel and wasn't bothered by the courtyard noise. There was heat (no choice for A/C if you're one who's always warm or like white noise) and they provided nice white down comforters because it was getting cold. Everything was lovely! Tip: DON'T BE CHEAP LIKE US....get the venice map for 3 Euros at the train station on arrival and you won't be running around like a lunatic looking for streets and wasting hours trying to find a restaurant etc. The hotel provides a map, it's not great, get the map that cost 3 euro. ; )", "Date": "October 23, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Belfast, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cExpensive, but worth it!\u201d", "Author": "summers_slayer", "ReviewID": "UR10053955", "Content": "My boyfriend and I stayed at the Hotel Gabrielli Sandwirth for 4 nights in June as a last minute impulse holiday and we were not disappointed. There seems to be a common theme among the reviews in that majority of the rooms are very small, however we did pay that bit extra for a deluxe room. It was very expensive at \u00c2\u00a31k for the 4 nights, but certainly worth it! The huge room was on the top floor of the hotel with 2 windows over looking the lagoon (see pics uploaded) so it was lovely and bright (with wooden shutters that could be pulled down if the sun was too bright for you). It had a king size bed (2 singles bolted together) 2 wardrobes, a dresser and stool, safe, a table and 2 chairs and our own temperature controller. The sunken bathroom was also gorgeous! Completely spotless like the bedroom, with 2 sinks, a large bath, shower, toilet, bidet, coat stand and shelves. As our room was front facing there was quite a bit of noise in the morning and evenings with the Vaporetto's and taxi's docking and banging against each other, but you will get this with any hotel you book along the water front and it actually added to the charm for us. Surprisingly as well the stocked mini bar in the room was about the same price as the bar if not cheaper as we were well chuffed by how small the bill was on check out. The continental breakfast in the hotel is pretty standard with a bowl of what looks like tinned fruit salad, fruit juice, great coffee, pastries, eggs and cold meats. You can have your breakfast either in the little restaurant which oddly also serves as the corridor to the elevator, so I would personally sit outside in the little garden. Tip: If you are having a drink late at the hotel, you can only sit out the front until midnight, but you can ask the barman if you can sit in the garden later if you like. Order the Venetian drink Spritz at your preference of sweet or bitter. Another benefit of this hotel is the rooftop terrace. You can sit here after a busy days shopping and sight seeing and enjoy the view over Venice and order a drink from the bar where you will also be brought some olives and peanuts. The hotel itself is the perfect location for anyone's 1st visit to Venice. 5 minutes walk away from St. Marks Square, a 1 minute walk from a variety of restaurants and 50 yards from Arsenale Vaporetto stop and AliLaguna stop, perfect for anyone travelling from the airport, so you do not need to drag your bags for miles. All the staff we had dealings with were friendly and polite enough. The concierge is very knowledgeable so take advantage of that and ask him where to go, how to get there etc... He booked a walking tour and a boat tour for us. A couple of the receptionists are a bit abrupt, but we did not have much dealings with them anyway. I would highly recommend this hotel, but I would say pay the extra for a better room! I saw a small room when housekeeping had left the door wide open and it was dreary with 2 single beds crushed in with only about 2 feet of walking space and 1 window.", "Date": "October 8, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cDon't believe the web site\u201d", "Author": "Carringt0n", "ReviewID": "UR8618131", "Content": "If my stay at this hotel taught me anything it was not to trust Hotel web sites in future.

The rooms are charming with their own little quirks. Open a door expecting a closet and you might find another sink with perfect lighting for doing your make-up while your husband is steaming up the bathroom.Wonderful little courtyard for breakfast where we could plot our walk for the day. There is afternoon sunbathing with cool drinks on the roof terrace which has a spectacular view; or after dinner drinks on the sidewalk from Santi, the bartender. Santi has all the personality in the hotel. (We did not have dinner at the hotel) There is also a lovely shaded garden in the back for a quiet swing while reading a book. Convenient to all the boats, water taxis, gondolas, alilagunas you could want, the hotel is a two minute walk to St Marks. In the late afternoon, you can have a drink at one of the cafes in the square and enjoy the war of the bands. Splurge and enjoy a water taxi tour with a bottle of wine. A great way to enjoy the charm of the city! Of course there are always the gondola rides as well! We took a boat from in front of the hotel to Lido for a day at the beach. From the airport, you can take the Alilaguna Rose to Arsenale which is right in front of the hotel. If there are four or more of you, I would recommend tossing in a few extra euros for a private water taxi. (Between 90 and 100 euros) Beautiful boats! Ask him to go down the grand canal. It will set the tone for your whole stay!

We'd booked a room with a lagoon view at La Perla di Venezia for our last night in Venice, but had arrived to discover that there was a problem with overbooking; after lengthy discussion, the management agreed to find us alternative accommodation with a similar view. The Gabrielli came up trumps (and although our departure from La Perla seems to have been a lucky escape, judging from other TA reviews, to their credit they paid the difference in the room price for us because the Gabrielli was about 50 euros more expensive). We were delighted with the Gabrielli - but then, we like those sorts of grand hotels that have definitely seen better days but still have a touch of dignity although otherwise faded or slightly shabby. This was certainly not that bad! Breakfast was acceptable and plentiful (although the coffee was execrable), and the roof terrace was terrific, even in the Venetian drizzle. Our room was large and bright and had a huge gothic window with a spectacular outlook over the lagoon, as well as a wide ledge on which to sit and sip some wine whilst watching the comings and goings on the Riva below. The bed was comfortable and the chandelier a magnificent example of Murano opulence. We loved the bathroom too, although I can imagine it is not to everyone's taste - probably last renovated some time in the early 1950s, with its black marble walls and green bath and fittings (possibly even 1930s with its Art Deco feel); it was a good size and perfectly clean and serviceable. The shower curtain wasn't quite up to the rest of the room, but we just had a laugh at that! There was also a separate second basin hidden in a cupboard, which came in handy at times. I think what we liked most - apart from the view - was the fact that our room had individuality and character, had not been overly modernised and was not a bland replica of every other new hotel room in Europe. This is a great hotel if you can get a good deal on a room and view over the lagoon.

I assume those who wrote poor reviews failed to do their homework and make this request prior to their stay.

St. Mark's is only a 2 minutes walk along the lagoon and is visible from the lagoon rooms (amazing views). The hotel is a short walk to the Rialto and the Cipriani area and the vaparetto line in front of the hotel goes to Murano. My advice to anyone considering this hotel is not to rely solely on pictures provided on travel websites (they are pictures of the lagoon rooms) when booking an economy room.
