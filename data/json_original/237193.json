The apartment block across from the Grifo holds three hotel rooms on the second floor (no lift) of a private apartment block which is in the process of having its front facia updated, so is scaffolded and covered in sheeting. The room was TINY. It was really a single room with a double bed in it, which was really cramped. The room was dark with old furniture and a stained bed quilt and we had to keep the shutters and curtains closed due to scaffold and builders walking past our 2nd floor windows all hours. Luckily after two days there was a flood in the building, so we got moved to a triple room in the main hotel which was much better experience - light bright, could actually open our shutters and all round so much better. I would NOT recommend the apartments over the road, even when the refurb is finished. With regard to the rest of the hotel, we liked the roof terrace, and the hotel receptionists were pleasant. Breakfast was basic - untoasted bread and croissants - buy a toaster Grifo management - this is a basic breakfast requirement! We loved Rome and enjoyed ourselves immensely in the city and the weather and italian people and dining experiences were just great. Despite a great location near the Collosseum, based on our first two days experience at this hotel, we would not return. PS watch out at check out - the manager said we owed an additional 16 Euros in CASH no RECEIPT as we were Expedia customers for 'tax'. We insisted on a receipt, which he didnt want to do.

My boyfriend and I stayed here from January 19th to January 22nd, 2012. We booked through Expedia and paid a total of 162 Euro for a three night stay, which is an unbeatable price for the location! You can walk to every attraction, and take a night stroll around the Colosseum, which is less than 10 minutes away. After reading the reviews, I was a bit concerned about having a shared bathroom and about problems with the heating, so I wrote an e-mail and got an answer right away. They told me we would have our own ensuite bathroom, and that heating problems were already fixed. They're really nice and attentive, so if you have any doubts, e-mail them. Our room (122) was not as small as people say, perhaps we were lucky. It was a normal room, only the shower was tiny. We had a window in the room an another in the bathroom, both facing the street, but we didn't suffer any noise because the windows are new. The bed was really comfortable, and everything was spotlessly clean. Decoration was quite tasteless, but hey, we only went there to sleep. The only thing I didn't like at all was the door; it seemed ancient and didn't fit the frame, so you could actually see the room's ceiling through a strip from the outside. Also, the key was very old and key wards were inexistent, so I'm pretty sure it would have fitted in other door's locks. It's a small place, so you didn't get a sense of insecurity because nobody can sneak inside without people noticing, but being a woman I wouldn't stay there on my own. Breakfast was simple but nice; good coffee, croissants, cereal, juice, nutella, etc. I missed a toaster for the bread. Free Wifi is a plus, and location is so nice that I'd probably stay there again.

Very small, basic room. Beds were not too comfortable, but all seemed clean. Refrigerator was broken, but quickly replaced. Air conditioning strength was poor. Thank goodness for the terrace! After a very long day of sightseeing, it was nice to be able to sit outside and relax with our family, but still have some privacy. Shower extremely small, and I am a thin person. Breakfast had a good variety, but coffee is not ready until 6:00 a.m. (we're used to getting up and out early!). If I came down at 5:45 a.m. for coffee/tea only, the person (man) putting it out seemed very put off. When we checked in, the person working at that time (Jonelle) told us the room would not be ready until 1:00 p.m. So we went out for several hours, coming back at 12:50 p.m. He said it was not yet ready, so we took a seat in the bar area. At 1:00 p.m. I walked over to where I was sitting and asked him if it was ready and he said yes. So why could we not have gotten the room ten minutes sooner? Simple, he just wasn't going to do that. Before arriving at this hotel, I had confirmed that the price of our stay was good whether we paid with cash or credit card. I brought a copy of the confirmation email with, but not the particular page that said the price was the same, whether paid by cash or charge. So, of course, at checkout, Jonelle (again) would not honor the price quoted.....I showed him the page that quoted the price, but I didn't have the page with me that said the price wouldn't change if I used a credit card....Oh well, my mistake, right? After getting home, I attempted to resolve this matter with Rose, via email, and was given the complete run around; Live and learn, right? When I called my credit card company about this, they said \"unfortunately, we see this sort of thing all the time in Italy\". Truly unfortunate. Other than this incident, we enjoyed our stay in Italy. Bottom line, I would look elsewhere for lodging next time. Nearby, there are some decent, inexpensive places to grab a bite, close to Colleseum, grocery store (for cheap beer!!), short cab to Termini, bus to Vatican City.

I am writing this because I had benefited from all the reviews of this and other hotels I got from Tripadvisor 1) great location - easy to zip back and use the toilets if necessary. Highly recommend you walk to/from all locations, even the Vatican City which is the attraction that is the furthest away. (Staff suggested we took the bus but it was hard to find the bus stop. In the end we asked someone on the street who told it was easier to take the Metro than the bus. Thank goodness the tickets we bought from the newsagent could be used for both the Metro and bus). Apart from the exercise you will get, you will avoid crowds in the buses which ply the tourist routes, which are famous for pickpockets 2) breakfast adequate though would have preferred more variety. Staff may be a bit slow in replenishing some breads so do go down early for breakfast 3) staff spoke reasonable English but directions given were not always clear 4) room small - had to always pack our luggage up to make room - but clean. Adequate for a night's rest 5) There is a grocery store nearby - good for buying fruits and bottled water To get to the hotel from Termini be prepared to walk (when with luggage) up to half an hour (not 10min as stated on the hotel website) as the cobbled stones don't make it easy to drag any luggage. But persevere, following the directions on the website. Be warned that all travel guidebooks' maps are not so detailed, so you may think you have missed a street since you may feel you have walked a long way but don't see the street the hotel is on. If you prefer to take the Metro from Termini to Cavour station, you will need to climb up quite a lot of steps to reach the level where the hotel is, so you may not want to attempt that where you have luggage to pull/push along (instead of a backpack). However, when leaving the hotel, it will be easier to take the Metro from Cavour, because the line going towards Termini is built on a higher level than the line from Termini - no need to climb any steps 6) they do have a lift (all the rooms are not on the ground floor). It does work well, but it is very tiny so if you are travelling in a group/have lots of luggage you will not be able to enter all at the same time) 7) If you book directly via the hotel website (like I did), and pay in cash, there is an 8% discount. The discount is less if you had booked it through an agent (cannot recall what the manager quoted - may have been 5%, but luckily I remembered the 8% figure so I clarified with him.

If you are looking for the luxury of a British 5 Star this is not the hotel for you. BUT, if you are looking for a really good base from which to explore Rome, then this hotel is well worth a look. The hotel is very clean although some of the paintwork is starting to look just a little bit 'tired'. Our room No. 28 on the 2nd floor had a small but adequate built in wardrobe, dressing table, large double bed, bedside cabinets, air con tv and ensuite which had a toilet that was also a bidet. (Look for the lever on the left hand side of the wall). The shower was more than adequate. The shower tray may fill up if you are in there quite a while - but don't be alarmed, it never gets so full that it overflows!!!! The double glazing definitely kept out the noise of the street. Although the hotel is not on a main road, locals use it every morning and evening on their commute to/from work, The continental breakfast was plentiful, 3 different types of cerals and cold cuts, hard and cream cheese, orange and pineapple juice, a variety of bread, rolls and croissants, jams, honey and nuttela. Coffee tea and fruit teas. Perhaps the only missing ingredient being fresh fruit. The sheets, pillowcases, bedspread and towels were all immaculately clean and fresh. The staff, helpful and friendly and definitely a hotel I would be happy to stay in again. The hotel is situated very close to the Collosium (less than 10min walk away) and apart from the Vatican all the other major sites are about a 15-20 min walk from the hotel. We are not exactly spring chickens but we managed to walk to the vatican (around 40 min walk) and back again. But for those who can't face it a No.40 bus will get you there but depending on the traffic it could still take around 30 minutes. We booked through Hotels.com and paid 109 euros per night.

The first room they put us did not have blankets. It was freezing the first night and the heater took 10 hours to start working. The mattresses made my back hurt and the curtains and spreads looked like they were 20 years old. We paid for a Room with a terrace and our \"terrace\" was filled with what looked like air conditioning equipment. The elevator was small and started making strange noises the day before we left. The location is amazing. The metro is a 5 minute walk from the hotel and buses are about a 10 minute walk from the hotels. The hotel is located in a historic district of Rome. Julius Caesar was born 5 minutes from the hotel. There is an amazing cultural and artistic life in the area. We found an amazing Book and Wine Bar called Libro di Vino two minutes from the property. The Colosseum is about a 15 minute walk from the hotel For the most part the staff was accommodating, although there were times that some were not. Rosa, Mohammad and the night clerk were very helpful. I had arranged with Rosa for a discount on my room price and when we were checked out, they tried not to give it to us...even though they had the email right in front of them. When we switched rooms, we asked that our bags be moved. Instead of one of the guys moving our heavy luggage, the maid did it. I was NOT impressed. She was tiny and our bags were heavy. She had to carry them down a steep flight of stairs (We asked for them to be moved so that we would not hurt ourselves coming down the stairs.) The price is too much for what you are offered in the hotel. There is a hostel down the road, Ostello Marello that was a fraction of the price. (An American we met there stayed in this Hostel. It was nicer than what we had by far!) The Hostel is run by nuns. I would suggest that or another Hotel over Hotel Grifo. 3 of us stayed in the Hotel over this trip.

Some restaurants nearby but tends to be noisy during at nighttime. Accessibility is so-so. the hotel location is about 20 minutes walk to Colloseo. should you wish to go around and see Rome ,you can take the Metro which is few minutes walk from the hotel. From the airport, you can take a group shuttle to your hotel and will cost you less than 50 euro but it would take you more than an hour to get to your hotel. Because the driver need to drop off passengers to different hotels. If you are two persons and wished to take the Leonardo Express from the airport to Termini station then transfer to a cab to this hotel, it will cost you practically the same. Hotel is about 30 kilometers from the airport. Since we need to leave early from the hotel to the airport for our next destination, we have asked their personnel to arrange airport transfer solely for us. For regular hours charges is 50 euro and 70 euro for (10pm-7am) service.

We didn't research the hotel at all and went on our friend's recommendation. We emailed the hotel in advance to be sure they could accommodate our need for an ensuite room with space for 4 adults, preferably at least one double with two twin beds. We were informed there was such a room. When we arrived, I, the mother, was struck by the dowdiness and smallness of the room. I was depressed after some of the places we had stayed that were actually less expensive and much nicer. My family said the room is clean, it has the bathroom in the room, the beds were fine - one queen and two singles, and all seemed to be in working order. Once we went out and found so much within walking distance, the earlier and negative impression went away. We realized the location was incredible. We found too that the hotel staff were indeed friendly and very helpful. We were given a map several times with the places we wanted to go highlighted. Our Vatican tour was booked through the hotel in advance of our stay. We were picked up at the hotel door and delivered back as described in an email to us from the hotel. The van for the Vatican tour was late arriving, but the person at the hotel desk sensed our concern and called the tour company to be sure that we were not forgotten. The breakfast was quite adequate - meats, eggs, yogurts, bread choices, cereals, juices, and more. I especially loved the ability to have plenty of coffee. WIFI didn't reach our room on the 2nd floor but we used it in the lobby/breakfast/bar areas during the day or evenings. It was a hike to go up and down the stairs but there is an elevator available. When we were ready to leave, the hotel staff arranged our taxi to Ciampino Airport and told us the approximate cost. That was the only taxi we used while in Rome. Otherwise, we found train and subway and walking as adequate ways to get around Rome. We did get a ROMA pass, which seemed to be a good deal for us.

Our room is on the second floor and the window opens up to the street. I personally enjoyed the wide window because I stick my head out and watch the people passing by, and some have a very nice and friendly smile while waiving at me. \u00a0 We have no complaints with our room, it was basic but clean with two twin beds, one pillow per person and decent size bathroom but the shower is small.

We were able to use this card to skip long lines and we didn't pay any entrance fee at the Colloseum and Castel Sant' Angelo and didn't have any trouble using it. But we missed other major sites where we can use the card; make sure to check out the sites listed in the packet and hours of operation. We were able to use this card for bus rides as well (we either show our card to the bus driver or scan), and according to the packet you can get discounts when you have the pass to show but we didn't get a chance to try. We walked to the Colloseum, Roman forum was just nearby, St. Maria Marggiore, other sites and around the area for sightseeing. Other days we took the bus from Via Nazionale to get to Piazza San Pietro, and to Fontana de Trevi. I walked around in the daytime to just check out the some of the little streets and I had no issues finding my way back, though I had no idea where I was since I just kept walking around and used the map when I was ready to go back. For sure, I picked up a cone of gelato then continue my walk, and later on got back to my hotel. The front desk personnel told me about this caf\u00e9 is just a step away from the hotel, went there and they serve some snacks while I have my glass of wine. But that was around 5pm where they are getting ready for dinner, so maybe snacks doesn't always come with the drink for free. We were lucky when we were in Italy, it was the Republic holiday so there's a lot going on. \u00a0 So, overall the hotel is in a great location, basic room but clean, small shower, staffs are friendly, helpful and professional, and I wouldn't mind staying here again.", "Date": "July 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Moscow", "Title": "\u201cNot so bad as it could be\u201d", "Author": "Drnadin", "ReviewID": "UR114837462", "Content": "Nice appartments in the separate building.

First, it's in a terrific location. The Colosseum and the ticket office to the Palatine Hill-Forum are about five blocks due south, while the Cavour metro station is even closer to the east (one stop to Termini and a transfer to Line A, which services the Vatican in one direction (six stops) and San Giovanni in Laterano in the other direction (three stops)), so it's a good base from which to explore room on foot. Via del Boschetto is not a main street, so the area generally is quiet (we had no trouble sleeping in rooms 33 and 34 which are on the corner of del Boschetto and a small dead-end alley). Second, the staff at reception could not be friendlier and more helpful (thanks to Luigi, Alessandro, and Rosa). They provided us a map upon arrival and dispensed helpful advice on many occasions, often going on-line to look up opening/closing times, ticket costs and availability, etc. Communication beforehand via e-mail was excellent; check-in and check-out were effortless (credit cards are accepted but a discout is given if paying cash). The amenities are pretty straightforward. The rooms are spartanly furnished. Our family of five (children ages 13, 11, and 5) occupied 33, which is a quadruple with a large bathroom (tub with \"telephone\" showerhead), and 34, which is a double with a smaller bathroom (shower stall only). Beds were made each day and towels changed. I am of average height and I found our double bed a bit short. The TV has plenty of Italian channels, but no international ones that we could find. Breakfast was a weak spot. The area is small with only a handful of tables, so it got crowded quickly and people had to overflow into the bar area. The selection was adequate for a short stay (three kinds of cereal; sliced ham, turkey, and cheese; rolls and croissants; small yoghurts; coffee, hot milk, and hot water; orange juice). There is one computer terminal in the bar area (3 euros/hour for internet access).

The coffee was great and they always accomodated us when we were early or late. The breakfast was enough to hold us over until lunch. Our linens were always fresh everyday. However, the beds are not to be desired but we don't stay in our beds very long on vacation. We get up in the morning and are usually gone all day. They have a few restuarants right around the corner that have the best pizza and customer service. It also is 2 blocks from the Coloseum and metro.

But the government cleaned it up years ago and so it became a bohemian area. We noticed the safety of the streets at night and he explained that the neighborhood has many police stations all around. Asked why, he told us that it is because Berlusconi's house is situated near to the end of the hotel street. We walked there and could not figured exactly which one is it, but we think it was the one with high fences, aprox 500 meters up the street, in another street to the left. Anyway, besides the central location, the fair price, the special staff, the area surrounding the hotel is an attraction itself. We strongly recomend it for romantic couples of any age. In fact, our next trip to Italy will be made only by me and my wife this time (without the kid), and we will stay exactly in this hotel again. It really worths the stay!

Our room (with an inside full bathroom and a shower) is clean and big enough to accommodate two people. It has a comfortable bed, a desk with a television, two corner tables, a small refrigerator, a large cabinet to hang and store your clothes, and a telephone. However, the size of the shower does not provide a normal size person the room to move around and/or bend while the sliding door is closed (I was careful not to drop my bath soap). Also, I accidentally bumped into the water shower handle and unknowingly changed the water temperature. When taking a shower I learned to brace myself and gingerly shift my weight because the floor math could easily slide underneath my feet. From what we\u2019ve seen the hallway or outside bathrooms have bigger utility areas. On the positive side, Hotel Grifo is within walking distance to places of interests, the Cavour subway station and Termini train station, grocery stores, restaurants and shops. The hotel only serves breakfasts at no additional cost to hotel guests. Breakfasts included pastries, bread and toasts, cereals, hams, cheese tea, coffee, milk, fruits yogurt and more. The wait staffs are courteous, pleasant and friendly. The biggest asset of the hotel is the reception staffs (Alessandro, Rosa, Luigi and a young fellow I failed to get his name). These four individuals went out of their way to help hotel guests. They made our stay at Hotel Grifo gratifying. However, there is another fellow who is mature and he mostly works in the reception area during latter part of the evening until 8:00 in the morning. On several occasions, this mature fellow was not nice to my wife. For obvious reason, he even told her not to use the desktop PC, which is located in the room next to the reception area, between midnight and 7:30 in the morning. On our check out day, my wife inquired the other reception staff about the availability of desktop PC. She was told that it is available to guests day and night. Will we stay again at Hotel Grifo? The answer is a resounding YES. The location is great! The streets around the hotel are quiet and pedestrian friendly. And thanks to Alessandro, Rosa, Luigi and the young fellow.

After looking for a long time on travel advisor I found this little Gem in the heart of Rome. This was a trip with myself , my mother and 15 year old daughter thet was within our budget.

We knew this before we arrived so knew exactly what to expect. Beds really comfortable and rooms kept clean by lovely cleaners. Breakfast was really good. Ham, Turkey, Cheese , Rolls, gorgeous Coissants , yoghurts, cereals, coffee Tea, and jucies.The Hotel is so central to everything the only transport we got was the number 40 to the Vatican Museum and the Metro to Ostia Antica, which is amazing (do watch for pick pockets on Metro , my MUm had a lucky escape). The Colosseum is literally a street away. The staff at this hotel are truly exceptional, they will go out of their way to help you , nothing seemed too much to ask. Alessandro was really helpful we went to some places that we didn't even think about going to , he advised us of the best times to visit , he advised us of the Baslica St Paulo just one stop off the Metro after visiting Ostia Antica. Listen to him! We did contemplate not purchasing the ROMA PASS because we weren't sure we would get total value from the cost (25 Euro), But believe me it is well worth it with the public transport included and literally missing all the que's -Roma Pass holders use a different line, must a have saved us 2 hours queing in total at the Forum and the Colosseum.

It took us about half an hour to walk from Termini Station (which is about our limit wheeling suitcases.) It's probably 10-15 mins walk to either Cavour or Colloseo metro stations, which is why we didn't use the metro with this hotel. Negative points - small rooms. (Bear in mind at this price, you either get small rooms or a less desirable neighbourhood, with budget hotels in cities.) Shower room was down the hallway, which was inconvenient, even though was a nice size and only used by ourselves. Shower not always hot when expected. Also the the tiled floors and small size of the hotel mean noise travels, especially if other guests are inconsiderate. Service very friendly and helpful.

You can walk to the Coliseum & Roman forum (10 minutes) and actually we went on foot to visit most of the places around, except the Vatican where you can go with Bus 40, stop 5 minutes away from the hotel. The room was clean with enough space and we had our own bathroom - there are rooms with shared bathrooms as well. The staff was very friendly and gave advice in several languages: italian, spanish, german, english... The breakfast is nothing special though : american coffe, milk juice, bread & ham, cereals and some croissants.

The chamber-maid was also very nice. 3)The breakfast I think it's a good one compared to Italian style with a particular good juice. Not so good things: 1)The temperature in the shower was fluctuating and became cold when you started to feel better after a tiring day (in addition there was no hair-dryer). The sewerage was very poor and you had to close the water during the shower in order not to flood the bathroom. This was the most annoying thing in this hotel. 2)The view was awful (we had a standard double room with bathroom inside, no 31) towards the inside part of the building with warped walls, kitchens from other apartments etc. Fortunately, Rome is much too interesting to spend the time in the room and we kept the curtains closed (though the room was quite gloomy). 3)Because of the limited space for the breakfast, we always had to wait for the staff to bring more of what we wanted to eat.

After reading many of the reviews on TA, I booked 4 nights at the Hotel Grifo to conclude a 2-week trip across Italy as we felt confident that Grifo would be similar to the other budget-friendly hotels we had booked for our trip. Unfortunately the hotel left much to be desired & it was clear upon arrival that the website did a great job of marketing the only benefits of the property - such as it's lower out of pocket & proximity to Termini, which was a pretty easy 10-15 minute walk. As soon as we arrived at the hotel, I had a bad feeling. There was just something seedy looking about it that I can't quite describe. Although the man at check-in was more than cordial, I couldn't help but be distracted by the buzzing fluorescent lighting and overwhelming bathroom smell permeating the air. We continued up to our room which was basic but clean. The bathroom was smaller than any other we'd encountered during our 2-week stay in Italy, so much so that the stand-up shower flooded as soon as the water came on. Having arrived in Rome after stays in various properties over in Venice, Florence & Siena - we just couldn't justify 100 Euro/per night for a hotel that felt so creepy & decided it was best to leave. Again, the staff was more than accommodating when we told them we would be checking out the next morning. We moved on to another hotel in the area & couldn't have been happier with our decision. Like anything else, it is all about expectations and what you want from a hotel. I am fine with basic accommodations provided that they are comfortable, clean & safe and unfortunately Grifo did not give fulfill that role for me.

Positives: - great location, on a nice street, very close to to the Colosseum, and Cavour subway stop. - room was pretty clean (see note also in negatives), with working AC, and a comfortable bed Negatives: - damp smell in the room we had. I could not find any mould, but my allergies acting up (mould is my only allergy) suggests an issue with our room. Only stayed one night, but if I were to stay longer, I would have had to get another room, or another hotel. Our room also had missing knobs on drawers, etc. This I can forgive with a hotel in this price range in this location to be honest. - no hot water. I had to get a cold shower, as there was no hot water for us. Complained to the desk about it and was told to tell it to the boss the next morning. Our friend in a room upstairs seemed to have it. Hotel was full and no more rooms for us to go to. - *** never got the room we booked, and refused a refund or cheaper rate. This was the big negative for us. We had a triple family room WITH TERRACE booked, and confirmed via an email from Rosa back in the middle of January. When we arrived, a lady at the counter told us there was a 'problem', and they had to give us an 'upgrade.' When we checked out our rooms, we realized there was no terrace for our rooms. Also, the rooms were separated by three floors, when they were supposed to be a triple family unit. I believe the only way this could be considered an 'upgrade' would be if the second bed for the second room was now a double instead of a single. The extra double bed was of no use to us, and we wished for the terrace for our room. Again, was told to 'tell the boss in the morning'. The boss simply told us our room arrangement was OK for us, despite there only being three of us, separated, with no terrace. We also noticed that english comprehension declined sharply when we complained, but seemed fine otherwise... Again, with hotels in this price range you have to expect certain things, but not getting amenities you pay extra for and being given amenities you don't need or want is a big negative for us. We stayed anyways, just for one night. but not getting the rooms you have booked. This was our honeymoon, and the lack of a terrace for our room left a sour taste in our mouths, especially when the staff really seemed to not care one bit about it. So in the end, we did get a comfortable, clean bed. We just did not get the room we booked, or was able to get any staff member to address our issues such as warm water, damp (maybe mould), and the wrong room type.

It is also very near to local conveniance stores, markets, restaurants, cafes and some of the best ice cream in Rome is in the next street over... 2 - The type of rooms. We ordered a family triple which was a double room and a single room next to each other but with an adjoining balcony. The rooms on the 4th floor all have common access to a shared balcony full of flowers that runs out around the perimeter of the building (photo attached). This was one of the true highlights of the hotel. There was nothing better after a busy day sight seeing to sit on the balcony for an hour or two late afternoon chatting about the days events, planning the next day, admiring city life around you and generally unwinding prior to going for dinner at one of the numerous restuarants within minutes of the hotel. The only thing that may put people off this room combo is that our two rooms shared a bathroom which was just across the corridor outside our front door. It was for our use only but take a robe for when you nip out across the corridor. We did not have any problems at all with the arrangement. 3 - The staff were excellent and very knowledgeable about local facilities or tourist opportunities. The rooms are not exactly massive but thats what you expect with historic Rome city centre buildings and most of our time was out sight seeing or chill time was done on the balcony which is covered so even if you get rain you can sit in complete dryness.

Booked it via their excellent website and at 90 euros a night for a triple with breakfast, it was a bargain. We decided to follow the walking instructions from the Termini. It was a 15-20min walk but being first timers, we were totally unprepared for the cobbled streets and undulating terrain. Should have stuck to the main roads like in our maps and it would be fine. Initially, we were a bit apprehensive about the area. It is on the older part of town but we grew to be rather fond of the place. Didn't feel unsafe when we came back at night time. Location and area ~ walkable to most attractions. Colosseum and the ruins are a short walk away. Trevi Fountain about 20min. walk. Get acquainted with the bus routes which you can catch from Via Nazionale and it is easy peasy. You can also catch the 110 open top bus tour from Via Nazionale. At first glance, the road where the hotel is may look a bit dark and scruffy but you will soon discover small delightful shops - map prints, baby clothes, furnishing, a chocolate shop and even a jazz club. There is a fab pizza place (Pizzaria Leonina) which serves delicious pizza by the weight (about 4 euros for a generous rectangle slice). There are many trattorias around the area where they serve good , solid food. A large plate of hot pasta for 6-10 euros a plate is just what is needed after a long day of sightseeing. Hotel ~ It is quite a small hotel and by no means luxurious. The rooms are spotlessly clean with good housekeeping. We intially booked the family rooms which is actually a double and a single room with no interconnecting door and bathroom at the corridor. It has a terrace which would been quite charming in summer. However, we changed it to a standard triple which is more comfortable for a family with small children. The shower cubicle is about a metre wide and deep so I wouldn't say it is too small. Showers are strong but not hot enough. Breakfast is continental with croissant, bread with jam and butter, cheese and cold meats. Also cereal and you can help yourself to hot drinks. Better to go out and get a real cappucino at the bar. The staff are friendly and knowledgable. I am impressed with their service and my children were fussed over everytime. I would stay good value for money; especially if the highlight of your trip is to discover the Roman Ruins.

We booked well in advance, and despite this we arrived to find that we didn't have a room. We were told that there was a problem with the water, and we would have to stay at another hotel down the street. So, we dragged our child and suitcases down an unfamiliar street at 9 pm to the other hotel (which was nicer and cheaper by the way) with no offer from the hotel to assist in any way, but the man at reception was insistent that we should not pay the other hotel, but should pay Grifo. Later, we realized that was because the other hotel was 25 euros a night cheaper, so Grifo obviously wanted that profit for themselves. At the time, we decided to give them the benefit of the doubt since we had read nice things about the hotel. The next night we arrived at the Grifo, and the room was freezing. When we asked reception about this issue, we were told that there was no heat, so we requested two extra blankets. They then brought us one blanket, as that was all that they could find. And by the way, the beds were not really beds, but cots (no box springs) like one would find in a hostel, and the linens had hair on them. Finally, upon check out, we left in a hurry without closely checking our charge card receipt as we were trying to catch a flight. Upon arriving home, we realized that the hotel had charged us 200 euros above the agreed upon rate for our stay. We have contacted them by email and by phone, and have been told by them that they cannot credit a charge card back, and he asked for my bank details instead (like I'm going to give my bank info to someone that I'm in a dispute with), then we were told that they have other things to take care of right now because someone else walked out without paying, but to keep checking back.
