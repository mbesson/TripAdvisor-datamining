My wife was good in booking here and we must have gotten lucky to get a unit on a holiday weekend. This was our 2nd stay at the \"Suites\". Although our first visit was fine, it was lackluster. Long, slow lines at check in , restrictive this , you can't do that, you have to do this, blah,blah,blah. Grass half mowed, peeling paint, godawful TV, dirty carpet and a faint grandma smell. Not this time. Someone moved into management with an iron fist, a sense of customer service and a modicum of decorative talent. Check in was Mc hamburger fast, the time share shpiel was one question and quickly dispatched with a pleasant \"no thank you\". Grounds were immaculate and actually put the golf course next door to shame. Wow, 1 more than adequate bedroom, a large 2 entry bathroom with a spa tub/shower combo, big central room with tasteful furnishings, a dining area and a not so compact, compact kitchen. Did I mention 2 large flat screen TV's with a nice selection of channels? Holy all the comforts of home, Batman, I don't want to leave. This is not a $35 a night unit, but before taxes, we didn't even break $100. DVD's planned activities and all the helpful advice you can absorb are thrown in at no extra charge. Branson is the everymans Riviera, and Suites at Fall Creek are a touch of comfort and elegance that almost anyone who puts their shoes on in the morning and does an honest days work, can afford.

We arrived here on the 27th of August and will check out on the 3rd of September, 2012. We have a nice one-bedroom suite, with full kitchen, large bathroom, with whirlpool bath and double sinks, large bedroom with a comfortable king bed and a flat screen tv (32\"?), an adequate living area with a large (42\"?) flat screen tv, a nice dining area, with a table that seats 6 comfortably and a large screened-in porch. We have a full-size refrigerator, with ice maker, full-size electric range, full-size dishwasher, microwave, and stacked washer/dryer combo. The unit seems clean, but could use a facelift (carpet worn, paint chipped, bathtub stained), but the appliances and furniture showed little wear. The staff is pleasant and responsive. We didn't like our shower head and a replacement was furnished expeditiously. There are loads of activities available on-site (mini-golf, shuffleboard, horseshoes, sign-out dvd's, crafts, stuff for kids, etc.) and most of them are FREE, not typically free at other timeshares we've experienced. In response to some of the reviews I've read about this resort, they do have several buildings and some are not equipped with elevators, so you should check on that before you arrive, preferably before you make a reservation! Also, you can reserve this resort on sites like Travelocity at a reduced price, but you will most likely reside in a different area of the resort, allocated to those types of reservations, which may not have equivalent features and/or accommodations.

She gave us a slip saying we had a free gift if we went to the concierge area. Upon going there we were given a nice tote bag, and were quickly invited to sign up for a time share presentation. I declined and we left to find our suite. We were very pleased with our accommodations. We had a two bedroom unit. The bedrooms were large with very comfortable beds. Both had large flat screen TVs. There was a master bath with a great shower and jet tub. The second bath also had a very unique shower. There was a large living area with a sofa bed, two recliners, a fireplace,and a large flat screen with a DVD player.There was a dining room area and a sunroom with a table and chairs. The kitchen had appliances that looked new, and was fully stocked with anything you would need to make a meal. An added bonus was having a washer and dryer. The entire unit was decorated very tastefully with quality furnishings. The whole unit was quite lovely. Shortly after we checked in we received a phone call again asking us to sign up for a timeshare presentation. My husband firmly told them that we did not wish to go to the presentations, and they did not call again. We were disappointed that the indoor pool closed for renovations the first day we were there. It was posted on their webpage, but was not when we booked our reservations. There were two small outdoor pools which were adequate, but very crowded. They have many scheduled events throughout each day that you can sign up for-some free, some with charges. We did have to call in a repair to our jet tub. Someone came in about 30 minute, fixed the problem, and then a staff member followed up with a phone call a few hour later to make sure everything was working properly. Do note that cleaning service is not included in regular room rates. There were ample towels and linens, so along with the washer and dryer, it was not a problem. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here, and can highly recommend this resort,. It was great to have plenty of room to relax in luxury for a price very similar to a regular hotel room.

We have stayed at Suites at Fall Creek 6-7 times, and here's why we keep coming back: 1. Nice furnished suites- in a one bedroom, there's a kitchen, dining area, living room, bedroom, bathroom with walk-in closet, and screened in porch. We always take our portable hammock and put it on the porch, so it's like another reading room. Our 5 year old likes to play in the closet. There are two big screen tvs. Honestly, the couches tend to be uncomfortable, but we work around that. The kitchens don't have every gadget, but enough to get any job done. To make sure we are close to all the activities, we always ask for buildings 20 - 22. 2. Amenities- There's an outdoor and indoor pool, an outdoor and indoor hot tub, plus you can check out some pool toys. They have a free miniature gold course that is fun- maybe not as elaborate as others, but it's on-site and free! They have a tennis court, three shuffle board games, sand volleyball, a horseshoes pit, grills, a playground, and covered shelter area with lots of seats and tables. Inside, there's a pingpong table and foos ball game, Wii, Knect game (sp?), puzzles, small workout room (each of the 6 machines has a tv, bring your own headphones), and some other games. They have lots of movies that can be checked out- not brand new ones, but many fairly recent movies. The Paradise Activities people set up activities throughout the day- we enjoyed the circus games and bingo. When our daughter was 4, she painted a vase that turned out really cute. 3. Location- The Suites are about 1 1/2 miles south of the strip, and taking the alternate yellow or red routes gets you most places quickly. There are several restaurants close by.

This year we signed up for the Tuesday night mixer and boy, were we glad we did. It is $15 each for dinner (fried chicken & fixins) and then a sampling of shows Branson has to offer. There must have been about 10-15 different acts so we got a great sampling, even including 3 Dutton brothers. This was all done in the activity center right there at the resort, so we didn't have to go far and it was really fun and entertaining. To top it off, the resort GAVE us free tickets to \"The Lengend of Kung Fu,\" which we attended and thoroughly enjoyed.

If you are looking for exciting, high brow amenities and nightlife, then you wouldn't be in Branson anyway. I have always had a problem with the sales presentations. We are owners, and it still takes at least 3 hours to shut them up. I have complained to Diamond about this and will continue to do so until they change it. The local food and concerts are very nice. Don't go to Branson expecting to see your favorite performer any night of the week. The more famous country stars are only there a few days a year, so look at the schedule and plan accordingly. We won't be going back to Branson, not because of the resort, but because we did what we wanted and will be visiting other properties now. It's also not easy to get to.

Our room was clean, the bed was comfy and it had a decent TV. On the surface it was very good. The devil is in the details, however. The reasons I won't be back are as follows: #1. We have an AT&T account, so we didn't have to pay for internet. However, it was a pain to enter our account information every few minutes when the system timed out. Also it was incredibly slow and thus irritating to use. If you don't have an AT&T account, be prepared to pay about $7 a day for very sub-par wifi. In a day and age where every cut-rate motel is offering free internet, for an at least semi-luxury condominium complex to take this sour approach to such an important amenity, is just inexcusable. That's the main reason I won't be back. #2. Lots of minor annoyances. For example the concierge called us twice during our weekend stay to badger us about attending a timeshare meeting. I had to get pretty rude with him to get him to stop. It was really obnoxious. We started avoiding the common area for fear of running into him. That's the opposite of how a concierge should make you feel. You also have to pay for room maintenance. Run out of towels? Sorry, they're going to charge you to bring more up. #3 The walls are paper thin. I could hear entire conversations next door and it kept my wife up at night. I just can't stress this enough. The Motel 6 has free and relatively speedy wifi. Why doesn't this place? Only reason I can think of is poor management. Don't waste your time here.

The pictures made it look like a nice cozy resort. However, when we checked in, we were overwhelmed at the size of the resort. Our building was about a half-mile from the main building and we could only get there by driving on some winding, narrow, confusing roads and driveways. Our cul-de-sac had a cluster of 5 buildings. The screened-in balconies all look into other units. There was a creek running through the property but only 2 of the buildings in our section could see it (not ours). There is very little carry-over noise from side-to-side neighbors, but we could hear every step and flush of the people upstairs. Our unit was nicely decorated and the bed was extremely comfortable. However, the couch and side chairs were extremely UNcomfortable; we ended up removing the couch cushions and using folded blankets instead. The resort had two outdoor pools (the indoor one was closed for maintenance) but we had to drive to them. The main building had lots of activities and events for families. We only did the preview night, which cost $15 each for a fried chicken dinner followed by several performers from town giving snippets of their performances. We enjoyed these previews and ended up going to two different shows we hadn't heard of before this night. There were two huge issues we had with the resort. The first one is that the wi-fi is not included. We ended up paying almost $30 to subscribe for internet access, which was exceptionally slow. The second issue is that if you choose not to go to their membership presentation, they will ask you EVERY time you call the front desk or the concierge if you want to go to the presentation.

Everyone was very nice and accommodating. What we got was an ADA room. The shower was huge and he was able to roll into the shower. The pool was just steps from our door. The kitchen was nice. The carpet was dirty and needed to be vacuumed and shampooed. We were just going to vacuum, but one was not available in the room. They were very pushy about the time share presentation.

I also didn't like that the resort is on the same property as a trailer park and a condo community that doesn't belong to Fall Creek. the are owned by locals, which is fine, but it takes away from the vacation experience. If you are staying at the older unit, you have to drive past the owners units, then the condos, then the trailer park and then your at your units.

Our bedroom had a door that opened out onto the deck and the living room had sliding doors that opened out onto the deck, hence, we could enjoy the outdoors from both rooms. Our deck overlooked the White River. I was lucky enough to see a pair of Bald Eagles nesting in the trees on the opposite side of the river. We enjoyed our stay at the Suites at Fall Creek. Would probably stay there again if we got another incentive like Groupon.", "Date": "April 24, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Midwest City, Oklahoma", "Title": "\u201cAn absolutley wonderful time!\u201d", "Author": "Jeremy S", "ReviewID": "UR126981285", "Content": "I first have to say that we purchased our stay at this resort through a fundraiser silent auction at church so I don't have a true feel for the value of our stay since we paid WELL below the daily rate.

We were very pleased with the ease of obtaining travel directions, securing extra kitchen & bathroom supplies and even receiving a pardon for a few dishes that were broken during our stay. Very impressed. THE PROPERTY: This campus is very spacious and set back from the main road so it remains rather quiet and has limited traffic. The property is very large from the main office building to the building we stayed in so any visits to the front required car transportation (which is not a big deal). Other than our condo our party used the fitness center (which is small but sufficient for our needs) and the indoor pool and hot tub were nice as well. The pool had many guests in it but... its a pool we expected that. OUR CONDO: We stayed in a 2 bedroom suite which was perfect for our two, 4-person families. One room had a King bed, the other had a Queen & a Full sized pull-out couch. The living room also had a Queen sized pull-out. Our unit was very clean and well appointed with fairly new and nice furniture, 3 Sharp Aquos flat panel televisions (living room was a 52\" I believe). The kitchen had nearly all we needed for preparing and cooking our meals. The bathrooms had plenty of towels, etc. and the water pressure was fine. We did lose hot water at one point but only after numerous showers. We really loved the screened in patio at night for board games and adult beverages. The only recommendation I have would be to install curtains on windows facing parking lots because a lot of light comes through the blinds at night. This isn't a complaint however because you usually sleep with your eyes closed I believe.

The staff were friendly and helpful. The concierge was a little dissappointing as they only have info on the many shows on the strip. No info for other surrounding area activities (We wanted to do some kayaking and hiking in the area). Some had their own local knowledge but not the usual maps/flyers we were used to. The on-site activities were typical. No issues with the 3 pools though only 1 of 2 outdoor hot tubs were working. Grounds were clean. Accomodations in the room were average. The place was clean. Beds/linens were nice. LR furniture was well used. We enjoyed the screened balcony with a view of the hills. This place is located near a trailer park, which is nicer than most, but does mess the view up a little. But this is not Hawaii or some other exotic place, its Branson. There are two groups of building to stay at. Bldg 23-25 are near the pool/office and have pool/hills viewing. Bldg 25 has the latest /greatest amenities and you should request a 3rd or 4th floor unit to get a view above the trees/trailers. Bldgs 1-16 are located down the lane on Lake Taneycomo but is a about a half mile from the pool. So it your preference - lake view or close to the pool. There is another pool further down the lane by the marina/dock. This resort sits with privately owned condos in the area and security did say they are working to keep the non-resort people out of the resort pool/marina areas. Location is great, the strip is within 5 minutes and its close to Table Rock Dam area. Spiders...My my yard has them too...they did clean them off the building during our stay. Lighting along the outside walkways did shine into the front bedroom and and kitchen of our place.

Weve enjoyed our fishing from the Marina dock. Only thing that I didn't like was the manager at the Marina is a bit rude of sorts. My husband and I have never ever fished for trout. So we go down to the Marina the other am and bought fishing license and stuff like that. We go out there and get ready to start fishing. quite a few people fishing from dock. Gene comes around and says to me in a rude way. You can not fish here so you need to move. Well, I was a little upset by that because there where no signs marked no fishing.. I just got up and moved. Then I went back inside the store and the guy that sold us our licenses and stuff was so nice didn't get his name should of cause he was helpful and nice. I buy a chair. this same GENE dude keeps staring at me like I've stolen this chair or something. It kind of freaks me out a little because we bought 50 dollars worth of stuff the first time then 16 dollar chair and he keeps looking at me like im a theif. THen the next day my husband goes back fishing and this same GENE guy is a smart !!!! to him. he goes in store to buy a net and tells my husband that he has to see his room key and that he can't fish on the dock until after 430pm it was like 420 and others where fishing. Husband said why and GENE said because its only open to resort guest after 430. Hmm just the day before it wasn't that rule. So my husband said he said ok and walked around the marina for a few mins. got his poles ready and then GENE walked out and said I need your room key because its a 10 dollars a day fee. Itll be added to your room. Husband mad at this point tells him that he isn't paying that cause it clearly says everywhere as long as your staying here its free.

Her parents are owners in the Diamond Resort which has The Suites at Fall Creek as one of their properties and we were even considering buying into this particular property as well before this weekend, but we never had issues like we experienced during this recent stay...one thing is for sure, we will NOT be returning. I booked a one-bedroom suite with full kitchen/living room and a jacuzzi tub for a romantic getaway. Our room was on the second floor and upon climbing the steps, we noticed that the siding and windows were covered with dead bugs, mildew, and mold. The inside of the suite appeared to be clean but upon further inspection, we found that not to be the case. Each suite has a screened in balcony that has sliding glass doors and the first thing we noticed was that there was a 10inch gap between one of the glass panes and the siding on the porch. Upon further inspection, I saw that some of the brackets that are supposed to hold the pane in place were missing. We called the front office and they sent a maintenance man up to fix it...not a big deal. I also had to kill a couple spiders that had made a home around the TV, but I just attributed that to the fact that the glass pane was out of place for who knows how long. Afterwards, my wife and I went out to get dinner and returned to our room to eat and have a nice relaxing evening in the jacuzzi tub. My wife went to close the curtains before we sat down to eat and something, which was the size of a large mouse, fell out from the top of them and onto one of the chairs. Upon further inspection, I found it to be a giant clump of hair that looked like it came from a drain of a tub...needless to say, we lost our appetite. While my wife was calling the front office to let them know of the disgusting wad of hair that we had found, I noticed that the jacuzzi tub looked dirty. I ran my hand on the bottom of it to see if it was just a stain and my fingers turned black. We told the front office about this too and they said that they would send someone up to clean the tub and that they would have maintenance come up and look at the hair. The person also told us that they would e-mail their manager and that we would receive a call the next morning from him/her regarding our complaints. The maintenance guy did show up and he was pretty disgusted about the hair as well and said that he would take it down to show the front office. No one ever showed up to clean the tub... We never received a call from the manager the following day and when we went to check out the next day, they tried to get us out of their as fast as they could. We asked to speak to a manager and we spoke to the Front Desk Manager who was apologetic for everything that happened, but told us that since we booked through RoomStays and not \"Through Him\", there was nothing that he could do to refund us at all on our stay. He said that the most he could offer was a $50 gift card but said that the General Manager of the resort could do more. He said that he would have the GM call us when they got in for the day. We waited 3 hours and then received a call from the Front Desk Manager again (not the GM) and he said that the GM talked with their Corporate and that they weren't willing to do anything else for us except offer us the $50 gift card. We told them we would be contacting the Diamond Resort's Corporate office ourselves and that was about the only time that he actually sounded concerned about the whole matter. He pleaded with us to not contact them and to just take the gift card with which we told him that he could send the gift card out if he wanted to, but we were still calling the Corporate Office.

(The woman at the front desk indicated there were rooms available, but the hotel's booking system -- designed by the hotel's \"internal IT team\" -- wouldn't allow her to make the switch.) We ended up with two rooms at opposite ends of the resort. The room closer to the lake was quite nice and modern and nicely decorated, but the room near the clubhouse was very dated. The older room had absolutely terrible water pressure in the shower (think a trickle and you've got it). There is also no maid service or room service at this hotel so no clean towels, etc. during your stay. There was a pair of shorts on the floor of our room when we checked in so we weren't impressed by the general cleanliness of the room. Another weird thing was that there were miniblinds but no curtains on the windows of the older room, so there was definitely no chance of sleeping in.

We stayed last weekend in a 2 bedrm suite, top floor, on the corner. There were 5 of us, 2 kids, 3adults, one who is in a wheel chair - which always makes traveling a challenge. The staff was GREAT!! Everyone was friendly and helpful. There was a mix up with expedia and we were only scheduled to stay 2 nights instead of 3. We showed our comfirmation email and the manager took care of the problem. (They even sent a basket of goddies to the room the next day with a letter of appology for the mix up.) Our room was very clean and very well appointed! We had everything we needed. The 2 beds were very comfortable with lots of great fluffy pillows! Typical hotel - tacky flower decore but nice enough for a short time. :) The fold out couch was a dissapointment, the mattress was thin and lumpy and we used extra blankets under the sheet as padding. DEFINATELY NOT RECOMMENED FOR ADULTS! The screened porch was a great add on!! It was really nice to sit outside and look down on the grounds and the little waterfall. We loved our location and were glad we asked for a top floor room!! I would HIGHLY recommed calling and requesting a top floor and corner room; the porch/patios are larger and semi-private, no foot traffic outside your door. We were disappointed to have to walk quite a way to the only Ice machine. They could put in at least one more! I will agree that the walls here are thin and we could hear one another easily with all the doors closed. Part of this is because of the layout of the rooms. The second \"bedroom\" of the suite is actually the one room studio next door with a connecting door. This was perfect for our situation, but if you have the studio and some one else has the one bedroom suite - don't expect any privacy. The pool room is huge and has been recently updated and is very nice!! A little cold at this time of year, but very clean and great for the kids!! The hot tub inside is TINY!!!! Way too small to share with strangers!! There is an outdoor tub that is larger, but it was closed. The outdoor pool area looked nice but is of course closed at this time of year. The playground is really nice! And the volley ball area made a great sandbox since we didn't have enought for a game. The mini golf course is small and we didn't have time to play anyway. Overall we were very happy and will definately come back. One other thing, if you call them and they say they are \"FULLY BOOK\", don't believe it! We found rooms available on all 3 hotel.com, expdia and orbitz - after being told they were full. and at 60% of listed rates.

They made it clear that the good rooms are reserved for owners, and out-dated rooms like ours are for non-owners. The resort was apparently bought recently by Diamond from Centerra or something. They claim they are working on upgrading it. The mini kitchen is small enough that it takes contortionist like skills to wash your dishes. The room does have a nice alarm clock with an iPod dock.

Also loved having an open space where my son could play and the adults could visit, but then we had separate bedrooms to sleep in. It worked out perfectly for us. I will comment on some of the other issues that others have commented on. 1) Not dark enough in the rooms at night. This is true, especially if you are sleeping on the hide a bed in the living room. The bedrooms weren't as bad if you shut the doors. I recommend bringing a dark sheet to put over the windows if you want it really dark at night. 2) It is hard to find your room. This is also true, especially at night. We arrived at 11 pm, and the building markers are not well lit. it took us a few extra minutes to find the right suite. 3) Amenities are spread out and not within walking distance of the suites. This is also true. The place is enormous, and if you are wanting to stay somewhere that is all under one room, where the kids can easily walk to the pool, then this you might want to stay elsewhere. 4) The walls are thin and it is easy to hear other people. Yep, true too. We could definitely hear the people walking above us, and I'm sure the people below us heard my 4 year old running around like crazy. I tried to contain him, but the excitement of staying somewhere new was just too much!

Unbelieveable. They had 15 different show entertainers come to the restaurant area and each gave a little teaser performance for 5 - 10 minutes. It allowed us to choose exactly which shows were \"must sees\" and which ones were not quite our tastes. There were comedians, singers, musicians, and Polynesian dancers. The entertainers were 4 years old to a great grandpa. The show lasted 2.5 hours! The restaurant holds 100 people and it was filled to capacity. They served soft drinks, cookies, salsa, and chips. For those who can not be there on a Tuesday night, the apartment was in good condition.

On site, there were two hot tubs outside and one inside next to the pool, We planned to use them but we ran out of time. They were gluing new carpet to the miniature golf lanes so that should be ready to go. There was plenty of places to go for a healthy morning walk. The only suggestion we could think of was the building numbers should be in day glo! They are very difficult to see when checking in at night. We have never been to Branson before. In fact, I was dreading it, but we will be back! And, we will probably stay here again. To the reviewers who are frustrated because they can not be noisy after 10 PM, I empathize but I am happy with the ruling. It was very quiet! The lobby, restaurant, sales rooms, and activities center are in a free standing building away from the apartments. I can not imagine that they would not let a group celebrate there after hours.", "Date": "October 2, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Edmond, OK", "Title": "\u201cA relaxing and enjoyable stay\u201d", "Author": "Hope4lee", "ReviewID": "UR43865935", "Content": "We were very pleased with the Suites at Fall Creek.

Other places we have stayed at had large meeting rooms that you can rent out where you don't have to worry about making too much noise and you don't have to worry about shutting down at 10:00 pm. We had 9 units which were all spread out in 3 buildings. We had requested that they all be together. Most were on the 3rd and 4th floors which was very inconvenient since we all had children and the elevator we used was very slow and not air conditioned. We booked 6 months in advance so I thought we could have gotten better room assignments especially since our host is an elite member. We also didn't like the studio rooms separated from the 1 bedroom by only a door. Of course the people in the studio called the front desk twice and complained of the noise. Once was when the kids were playing charades at 11:00 pm and in the other room we were just talking and watching TV. When there is nothing more than a door separating the units so of course they are going to hear everything that goes on. We heard them but didn't complain. The walls in the units are \"paper thin\" as the expression goes. We were also a little disappointed in the swimming pools. How can you have a facility that large and only have 2 pools available to the guests in the middle of summer? It was very inconvenient to have to pile the kids into the car everytime we wanted to go to the pool or playground. One day everyone had to use 1 pool--1 pool was closed down by the health department and the indoor pool was never open the entire week we were there. In face, there was no water in it. It was supposedly being repaired, but we saw noone repairing it the entire week we were there. There were 2 hot tubs by the main pool--on one the heater didn't work and on the other the jets didn't work. Also, we decided one night to use the covered table area up by the playground. (this is the night we got the calls about being loud in our unit)but all the chairs were locked with a cable running through them. This was around 9:00 p.m. We talked to a group that was sitting at one of the tables drinking beer and they said you have to get there early to get a chair before they lock them up. BTW-They were not very happen with their stay at the resort either. So we returned the following night with our food and coolers to play volleyball and just sit around and talk while the kids played on the playground. We got there by 8:00 so we could claim our chairs before they were cabled up! Didn't see any signs posted about alcohol, yet security came and made the guys get rid of their beer. We're all responsible adults on private property--so lighten up a little!! Just the night before we saw 6-7 people around a table ---all drinking beer. Noone said anything to them. It was very apparent during our stay, that, because we were such a large group we were totally singled out for many things other were \"getting away with\". Another thing they need to work on is the general cleanliness of the common area porches and stairwells. They were covered with spider webs and the floors were very dirty--needed a good sweeping. We were there a week and had no room service. If you needed clean towels you had to take them to the front desk and exchange them. if you are going to this resort for the amenities, you will be disappointed, We didn\u2019t have a DVD player\u2014only a VCR player. Who brings VCR cassettes anymore?? The fitness center was very small and all equipment was not functioning. You also had to track down the activities director to let you in with her key.

I found this place by looking on Trip Advisor and reading the reviews. Some of them scared me and others were reassuring. Because we were on such a budget, we couldn't beat the deal we got for a 5 night stay. Check in was very easy since we booked our stay online through a travel website and pre-paid for our stay. We did not have any issues with using a Visa debit card for our room deposit as some of the other reviews described. Be sure to call the resort prior to your arrival to confirm your reservation, especially if you booked it online. The best way to describe this resort is that you have a time-share property that has been plopped in the middle of a modular home community and a condo community. From my understanding, The Suites at Fall Creek has had several owners and each company that has come in to try to ressurect it hasn't been able to. Bluntly, the place needs some TLC, but has definite potential. The lobby is pretty typical of such a resort. At check in, you will be directed to the Concierge to get your parking pass. Here is where you will be greeted with your \"bribe\" to listen to the \"welcoming presentation\" and then given your parking pass to keep on the dash of your vehicle. As far as the sales pitch, you can take it or leave it and if you say no, they don't bother you with it any more. However, we arrived and the weather was crummy and the forecast for the next day was for heavy rain so we said we would consider it. We were given our room keys and shown where our building was on the map. Well, because there are other condos within the complex, it was very confusing, so we had security escort us back to our building. We probably wouldn't have found it based on the directions we were given at check in. Our suite was on the 3rd floor and it was a building located at the back of the resort. Our bedroom window faced Lake Taneycomo. There was a lot of fog when we arrived so we weren't able to see the lake upon our arrival. Once the fog cleared, it was a beautiful view of the flowing lake. If you aren't familliar with Lake Taneycomo, then you will probably be disappointed that it looks more like a river and not a \"round lake\". There was some heavy machinery parked down the way from us and there was a lot of safety fencing behind the units. Because of the spring flooding, you could see where the water level of the lake had washed out areas of the bank and it looked like they were trying to repair that. From the building, you could not walk to the lake. We had a one-bedroom king unit with a sleeper sofa. The unit was well appointed, clean, and comfortable. We also had a nice screened in porch facing the lake that had a patio table and chairs. The washer and dryer in the unit was very handy too. A lot of the reviews mentioned that the walls are thin. I would agree that they are not exactly the best and that from time to time you could hear conversation that was above normal speaking levels. Occasionally, you could hear the guests above us walking through their unit, but nothing that was obnoxious or annoying. The shower and water pressure were great. We had plenty of hot water too. My son thinks we now need a jacuzzi tub and the double sinks made it easy for the three of us to get ready each day. As far as the bright lighting, we did not experience any of that because we were in an older building that had a \"porch light\" and safety lighting over the walkway and stairwells. I can see where someone that was staying in one of the newer buildings toward the front of the complex would have had issues. There are significantly more lights on the main walkways of those buildings. The king size bed of the unit was very comfortable as were the towels and linens. Be sure to take inventory of the kitchen items and linens and note any damage in the unit. . I did just because I don't want to be charged for anything after check out. There was a broken slat on the blinds in the bedroom and a few dishes missing. We gave the inventory list to the front desk so that they could note it and not charge us for it. As I mentioned, we decided to take the \"bribe\" and listen to the time share pitch. They promised it would take about 90 minutes and we would get our gifts as promised even if we said no. It was pouring down rain, so we figured what the heck! Yes, you meet with a sales rep, hear about the \"program\" and watch a DVD about \"living the timeshare lifestyle\". If you haven't said yes, then a \"corporate\" sales rep comes in and tries to lower the price making it more \"affordable\" for you. Then they give the \"closer\" a chance to offer you one last time a \"special offer\". They didn't whine because we said no and they kept the whole thing to 90 minutes as promised. We were given the gifts we were promised and it was definitely worth our time. Because of the rain, it made the outdoor pool too chilly, so my husband and son utilized the indoor pool and hot tub. They said it was just ok and that the water temperature was still chilly for being an indoor pool. My husband used the fitness center and said that the equipment was outdated and some of it broken and it was a very small area. Again, if you are going to this resort for the amenities, you will be disappointed, as they are not above average or superior. However, if you are looking for clean, roomy, and secure accomodations for your stay, this is a great deal. As far as location, it is far enough away from the 76 Strip that you aren't sitting in traffic, yet you are close enough to great restaurants and activities. One great tip I can offer is that you are a hop, skip, and a jump from Table Rock Dam, Moonshine Beach, and the Fish Hatchery. Even better is that you can take the alternate route to Silver Dollar City! It only took us 8 minutes to get from the resort to SDC by taking this route!

We belong to Interval International and traded our week in Hawaii for a week in Branson. Branson was not our 1st choice but we needed to use our week or lose it and Branson was the only place we could get a room that was not too far from home and our time off would allow us to go there. This resort is ok. We had a studio which was comfortable enough, but definitely not spectacular. We could see others next door that looked much nicer. We were led to believe that they were all booked and the studio room we had was all that was left. Untrue, as we were there a week and could definitely see units that were empty. Much larger and nicer units. The marina was closed due to earlier flooding. The pool is small and 2 outdoor hot tubs are also very small. Only open until 10pm which we think is ridiculous...even the indoor pool which would not bother anyone to be open longer and neither would the hot tubs. We listened to the over long presentation and Diamond does have a better deal to purchase timeshares than what ours is, but I would not purchase one in Branson. It was a place to stay for the week. The whole timeshare thing is a scam from top to bottom. I have not stayed at a \"5 star\" timeshare yet and doubt they exist. Because our unit on Maui is a studio we are not going to be allowed to trade up (even though we were assured we could since we own in Hawaii) If we could find a way to sell ours without taking a loss we certainly would, just to be free of the headaches of trying to book when and where you want to go. Suites at Fall Creek is about a 2 or 3 star hotel TOPS and certainly not worth it.

The representative told me that for a mere 279.00, I could stay at a deluxe 2BR resort for 4 days and 3 nights with wonderful amenities and close to 2 amusement parks. As i have 4 children who range from 7-15, it sounded like a great opportunity. I was told i needed to attend a short 90 minute no obligation timeshare but would recieve gifts at the end. So I paid and made reservations at that time for a Memorial weekend family getaway. When we arrived at the 4pm checkin time, we were given room 4 building 4. The place had a mildewed smell, and the tubs were dirty. There was a small lake less than 300 feet from the building, but when the kids went to investigate, 2 of them stepped in dog feces; It was all around the backyard patio. After an 8 hour drive, my oldest went to take a shower but the water turned ice cold after less than 10 minutes, and this was a normal occurrance for the duration of the stay. There were two children that looked less than 10 who were next to our room that ran around all night , screaming and cursing. We took the children to both the indoor and outdoor pools, which were nice but a bit crowded with unsupervised children. the next day, before the time share presentation, we met with other people who stated they were in these wonderful deluxe rooms with plasma tvs and for less than 200 for a week stay, they had been offered plus 100.00 and free show tickets to attend the presentaion. I started to become angry. We told the rep in the beginning of our presentation about the problems and he stated we were in a building that was not a time share building or a deluxe 2br, but one that is rented out by someone. He said the resort was double-booked and we must have been put there because of that. I explained Id made this reservation over 8 months earlier, but he just went into his speech. I was just getting more and more angry. I then asked him to show me what a \"deluxe\" 2BR was. He showed us this amazing model, with a FP and eurpoean shower; all that id been promised initially. He then started to badger me about this 25+ thousand timeshare package and Id had it. I walked out, collected my children and went back to the room. My husband filed a complaint about our room and when he went to collect the \"gifts\" it was basically a worthless coupon book. I do not advise going to this resort unless you are sure you will be in a deluxe and insist immediately to be moved if you get stuck like we did. We did not know what the options were out there, and when we did request to be moved, we were told basically since we were not purchasing the timeshare, the owners of the timeshares needed those rooms.

Overall, the place is nice, with lots of activities. We stayed in a \"studio\": a.k.a. one bedroom with mini-kitchen. The room itself was very clean, well designed and very comfortable. Honestly, we got more than we expected for the price. Things to look out for: The walls are very thin. So thin, we could hear our neighbors watching TV and discussing news of the day. I'm sure they could hear us as well. We stayed in one of the \"Villas\" typically used by timeshare owners. The layout of the property includes an RV park and a place for doublewides. These areas are not very separate from the \"luxury resort\" vibe Sunterra tries to project to prospective clients. If we weren't staying on the fourth floor I could understand why guests aren't happy about staying in a nice resort with a view of a trailer park. Buildings are too far apart...especially from pools/activities etc. Perhaps they are going to build more recreation areas to match new construction? When we arrived to check in, security guards were scrambling to deal with three separate reports of theft. (Two purses and a pair of gold earings). The on-site restaurant offers a very affordable breakfast buffet. $3.99--ya get what ya pay for and if you don't expect a huge smorgasboard you won't be disappointed. -If you are going to check out shows in Branson...the concierge desk offers some very nice discounts. When we arrived, a woman at the concierge desk asked if we would be interested in attending a timeshare presentation.

Our room also smelled heavily of smoke even though there was a no smoking sign posted in the unit. We did have a beautiful view of the golf course.

The condo unit we got was very small, old, and poorly maintained. There was no daily maid service. Each night we had to clear the spider webs from outside the front door. There is no evening restaurant on the very large property. This is the best part, the only ice machine was about 1 mile from our room, in a poorly lit, isolated outside area. No joking. When I asked the front desk receptionist in disbelief if she was kidding, she said \"no, and I wish they would get more ice machines, because I'm tired of the guest getting upset.\" There were several nice amenities and activities on the property, but in reality the main goal of the lodging is to get you to buy a timeshare. Which is really what they are geared toward. This location is at least a 3 mile drive to the main Branson strip, and there is only a couple of restaurants nearby, none within walking distance.

The screened in balocony was great to have breakfast on. I did not like cleaning up my room, because we weresceduled for the sales pitch and and the let us go AFTER out checkout time and we told the front desk they only gave us about30 extra minutes to check out. Well that woukd be okay but we had to clean the unit before checkout and as you can imagine with 4 kids that can be a chore.
