Situated on Beverly Blvd its a 10min walk to the Grove and Farmers market and a $10 cab ride to the Strip.Good size mall left out of the hotel and a short walk towards La Cienega. The room was big, two beds, 37inch cable tv, fridge and microwave.The bathroom was huge and I mean huge, I was staying by myself for the stay so was lost in the room :-) I was on the 3rd floor room 309, I understand this is one of the biggest rooms, not all are the same. The guy on reception told me they are in the process of renovation of the lower floored rooms. So next year it might be even better. The killer deal for me about this Motel is the Swingers diner below the hotel, open from 7am till 4am, it's licensed and has the best breakfasts ever thanks to the Mexican chefs.The breakfast burrito is to die for. Great juke box also, the punky tattooed girls that serve are gorgeous and add a good edgy vibe to the place, free wifi and brilliant. Good spot for late afternoon beers 4 - 8pm happy hour with snacks and PBR for $9. The wifi in the room isn't free and costs $5.99 for 24 hrs, little pricey but when you have been out taking pics and want to upload to FB it's worth it, especially when it's raining in England. Totally recommend this place, great base for Los Angeles.", "Date": "April 28, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco Bay Area", "Title": "\u201cFunky and cool -- no luxury, but it's all good\u201d", "Author": "megleo", "ReviewID": "UR128295341", "Content": "Went down to LA for a taping of American Idol (don't judge me -- it was fun!) and remembered the Beverly Laurel from 20 years ago, when it was slightly on the grungy side but had that mid-century LA thing going for it that made it cool.

There are Metro lines to catch outside of the hotel. I've stayed in the studio/kitchen rooms as well as the regular rooms. Carpet is washed after every stay, I know this because I've had to wait several times until my room carpet was dry. Decor is retro and all rooms w/o a kitchen have fridges and microwaves. I usually walk down to Roberto's Mexican taqueria down the street and order my taquitos with beans and rice or walk across the street and do take out Japanese. There are just too many restaurants near this hotel to choose from. Staff has always been courteous and kind. I remember I could not back out my car because someone had parked way too close to mine.

The parking and internet are both $5.00 each /night so that was VERY reasonable as other hotels in the area were double the price with internet of $10-15 and parking of $20-30.

We had a misunderstanding with one server as 4 of us were paying so we under-tipped by a few bucks and she let it be known that we did that.

They charge $5,- a day now for parking but I think this is a good decision because last time we found it hard finding a space to park when coming back late at night. I guess there were just too many people parking at the hotel and not being an actual guest. In the parking there is an old abandoned car which I really like and definitely not should be removed because its part of the charm of the hotel. Both times there was a film crew shooting at the hotel which immediately gives you the Hollywood feel. Bruce and Roberto from the front desk were both very nice. We had package shipped to the hotel and they took care of it which was really nice. Price is a bit high for my budget but reasonable because the location is perfect. Walking distance to the Beverly center, Melrose for shopping, Wholefoods market and Petersen Automotive and Lacma museums. I asked for a top floor room at the back and we got room 310 which felt more like a small appartment than a hotel room. It had 2 windows, a kitchen, 2 queen beds, a table, two chairs, large closets and normal size bathroom in it. Beds were clean, comfortable and heating was working fine (there weren't extra blankets and it was cold at night so I had the turn the heater on, so putting extra blankets in the closets will save energy). Also the pattern of the bed covers was very nice. Our other room had purple which was a bit dark but these were yellow. And it was super quiet! We felt like moving in immediately and staying forever :) Tv channels were poor and they charge extra for wifi but this didn't bother us because you're only there to sleep.

Great price, there are some cheaper motels nearby but most are more $$. Food: Swinger's diner is downstairs and is almost open 24 hours, Canter's is almost waling distance and is open 24 hours. Unlike my past experiences and despite several reviews here on Yelp, the Swinger's staff were actually very nice and helpful. Especially the two waitresses we had early Friday morning. Awesome health food market right across the street and huge Erewhon market three blocks away with full deli. My room was conveniently located close to the stairs and elevator to parking basement and had good sun and view of the pool. We were in room 104. The hotel looks nice and inviting, the room looks nice, but after living in it for a little while I realize that there are a few conveniences missing. And I,m not talking about extras like chocolates on the bed or free bottled water or ironing board and iron. I mean a HOT shower! How bout a coffee maker? How bout conditioner to go with the shampoo? Lotion would be nice. How bout a phone book, pen, clock!?! Big plus was that the room has a fridge and a microwave, bummer is that there was no dinnerware or mugs so the microwave went unused. Another big plus is the free hotel parking except that during prime dining hours @ Swingers the patrons use the hotel parking and apparently the hotel staff don,t enforce the Hotel Guests Only policy. Hotel staff and cleaning staff are nice. Guests seemed nice and were a mix of young crowd, thirty somethings on a budget, and a few families. I am sure that at least one of my neighbors was having a really good time because he let everyone know by screaming and singing and yelling at the top of his lungs for about 15 minutes at about 2:30 in the morning (not sure what time it was cause there is no clock in the room!) Rooms can be a little noisy when guests walk down the halls talking (or scream at the top of their lungs). The walls are thin. If it were hot outside, which it often is in LA, the pool seems like it would be really fun. But it was 69 degrees and the unheated pool was freezing. Bed is hard, so are the pillows.

Also, I stayed two different visits, first visit I got a refurbished room, 2nd visit I got an old room for the same price. The old rooms aren't nearly as nice (although I heard they are refurbishing all of them). The AC wasn't very good. The shower was cheap. Felt like I should be paying about $35 a night.

The reviews on this site are, for the most part, accurate. It does have a cool retro vibe - decor is adorable. Location is excellent, and there is free parking, which is important. The diner downstairs is FANTASTIC - we ate there several times and loved every meal, and the prices were quite reasonable. We were really prepared to love everything about this place. As long as everything in your room works, this hotel is great. So I assume that the majority of the reviews have been left by people whose rooms were functional, and probably the odds are in favor of that, so it may be worth the risk, particularly because LA hotels are so expensive. We would have been one of those reviews if we'd stayed in our first room, quite honestly. However, we had requested a king non-smoking and were given 2 doubles instead. We stayed there the first night, because we got in very late, and that room was nice, and everything worked. However, my husband is 6 foot 4, and the beds were WAY too small for him, and we couldn't share one (they were tiny), and since it was a romantic weekend away, we asked for a room change in the morning, and got one. No problem. This is when we discovered that if something in your room doesn't work, you're screwed. In the next room, the toilet was broken. We were told that maintenance couldn't come until THE NEXT DAY, so IF they could find one, we could have another room (like having a room with no toilet was a reasonable option!). In the room we were moved to, the shower was broken, and the answer was basically, \"Tough, wait until maintenance comes tomorrow\". The attitude of both people we spoke to about the shower (the night it broke and the next morning) was that we were being unreasonably fussy by expecting our plumbing to work correctly; one said \"I know about YOU people - you SAID your last room had problems too\" (as if we'd made it up) and the other said \"So in every room you have, the shower is broken?\" We calmly reminded him that no, the toilet was broken in the first room. However, we were pretty angry that no apologies were given and we were blamed for the problems; the usual response for a hotel in this case would be to apologize for having things in the room that weren't working, inconveniencing the guests. And they were pretty MAJOR things - it's not like the remote control was broken or something. Sadly, we had to agree that we wouldn't stay here again. Sure, we might get lucky and next time, our room might have no problems at all. Or we might have another broken toilet on a night that the entire hotel was booked - with this hotel's \"we don't call maintenance until morning if only one room is having problems, no matter what\" policy (this is what the front desk lady told us when we called about the shower), we could end up spending the night without a toilet, or having to pay for a room somewhere else just to get a room with a toilet that worked!

The parking situation is dreadful albeit \"free\". The hotel has approximately 50 rooms and there aren't even half that many parking spaces available. When you are lucky enough to find an open space the maneuvering needed to be done is pretty ridiculous as the \"garage\" is extremely small. The open air \"alleyway\" parking stalls aren't much better as several of them have significant dips that causes the undercarriage of your car to scrape the pavement. The room itself seemed okay at first glance, decently decorated with a king size bed. We must not have been assigned to one of the \"remodeled\" rooms that others have talked about here earlier. The bathroom was old and in desperate need of repair although the shower was extremely large and big enough for two. We did experience a minor ant problem on two different occasions which seemed to be limited to the bathroom area. The fridge and microwave were ancient and should be replaced. The bed was very comfortable and provided a good nights sleep. With the setup of the hotel you can hear everything that is taking place outside, sirens, voices, doors slamming, etc; earplugs would probably be a good idea.

We ate at Swingers for breakfast on one occasion, the food and service were good and I would recommend giving it a try. I would probably look elsewhere in the future even though the rate of $125 a night is not over the top. I chose this place over another hotel in the area primarily because of the free parking and would not have if I had known the problems it presented...disappointed.", "Date": "January 6, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco, California, United States", "Title": "\u201cInexpensive and Mostly Terrific\u201d", "Author": "ErikaMule", "ReviewID": "UR23105541", "Content": "During a trip to Los Angeles I wanted a place to spend a night in West LA near the Farmer's Market/museums. I picked the Beverly Laurel because of the location and price after reading reviews on TripAdvisor. I made the reservation through hotels-and-bookings.com, which offered the lowest overall cost, including booking fees. A room with 2 double beds was $95/night + $13 tax. The desk clerk who checked me in was very friendly and efficient. He mentioned that I had one of the newly renovated rooms (which may explain why some travelers had a negative experience). The room itself was large and well laid out considering the location. Everything was new and clean with a retro-modern look. Madonna pics instead of bad motel art. The bedroom window faced the courtyard, giving a nice view of the pool area. The bathroom extended the full width of the room on the Beverly Blvd. street side, providing an effective buffer against the street noise when the bathroom door was closed. A terrific feature of the room was the number of exposed outlets. We travel with laptops and other devices, and often have to to a dance of pulling furniture out from the walls and unplugging lamps. The television was smallish, just FYI. There was a fridge and microwave in our room. There were also a lot of mirrors throughout the room and bathroom. I suspect the renovations were done with sexy time in mind. The bathroom had a large shower with one showerhead on each end and a marble seat in one corner. Also, a long counter with a double sink, and some photos of Sharon Stone. Wi-Fi is an additional $5.95 per device for 24 hours. You need to call down to the desk to get a password. Our one negative experience involved needed to call down after leaving, returning, and forgetting the (complex alphanumeric) password. I think the night clerk got frustrated with our questions about the service. A few minutes after hanging up, he came up to the room in a huff with a password for each of us written on a piece of paper. Parking in the carport behind the hotel was convenient. There in one elevator in a corner of the building. The pool is small and shaded, probably better for atmosphere than sunning or swimming. You get a real key, rather than a keycard, which increases the likelihood of being able to enter the room on the first try. Swingers, the diner in the first floor, is awesome. Open until 4am. Great service. Tasty food, a lot of vegetarian and even vegan options. They deliver, so that is a totally acceptable (and reasonably priced) form of room service. When I checked out, the friendly day clerk was back. Again, very efficient.

We (me, wife, 8-year-old daughter) stayed at the BL the nights of August 8-9. First things first - don't let the name fool you; this hotel is not in Beverly Hills. It is on Beverly Blvd but that doesn't make it Beverly Hills. The surrounding neighborhood isn't bad (although most of the houses have bars on the windows) but it sure isn't Beverly Hills. We checked in around 3:30 Friday afternoon. The manager (owner?) is very friendly. We had reserved a non-smoking refurbished room. We asked for something quiet (not facing the street) but he told us this wasn't available in a refurbished room. He could tell that I was disappointed with this news so he upgraded us at no charge to one of the refurbished studios that face the alley in back. The cost of the room was $119/night plus LA hotel tax plus $2/day energy surcharge; parking is included, which is very rare in LA. My wife gasped when she heard our room number as this room has been the subject of a bad previous TA review. We never had any trouble parking and only had to go into the underground garage once. All of the parking is covered - others have mentioned that it is a tight squeeze but much of the tightness is due to people not properly parking within their space. There is no security for the parking garage - even the underground area does not have a gate or any noticeable security cameras. You are reasonably close to everything - The Grove is less than a mile away as is Fred Segal (on Melrose). The hotel looks old - it is old. The hotel does not have a web site but there are pictures of it floating around on the web. The pictures of the refurbished rooms are flattering - the reality is much less flattering. Our room had been refurbished but that word means different things to different people. The room is old and it looks old. There is no dresser so you will have no drawers in which to put your clothes. The flat panel was nice but it was not HDTV and the remote didn't work (we didn't bother contacting management about this). The kitchen area is small and looks really old. The fridge is a step up from a dorm size fridge but still very small. There is all kinds of light coming into the room, especially around the door. The a/c is a wall unit that blows cold but is very loud. The bed was not very comfortable and the pillows are the worst I have ever had at a hotel (not much bigger than what you get on an airplane). The bathroom is reasonable in size and had been refurbished but still looked old. The towels will bring back memories of gym class and the toiletries ... well ... let's just say that you should bring your own. All you get is a bottle of really bad combo shampoo & conditioner and the cheapest little bar of soap that I've ever seen in a hotel. The water pressure is good and there is plenty of hot water. With the exception of the a/c unit the room was quiet at night although I can imagine that if you face the street and are close to Swingers that it will be noisy. From what I can tell room 303 is furthest away from any of the noise so that might be the one to request. We tried the pool but didn't last long in it as it isn't heated. Even as I child I didn't like cold pools - I'm certainly not going to change that opinion as an adult. The pool water appeared to be very clean. Swingers is OK - the price isn't bad nor is the food. We ate one dinner and one breakfast there - I don't feel a need to ever go back because there are just far too many great places to eat in LA. I got what I paid for in LA. If you are expecting this to be some hidden pocket of luxury in Beverly Hills for Motel 6 prices you will be sorely disappointed.

We had no real issues that needed attention so I can't comment on the service, though the front desk was friendly and our room was always made up. They have a small restaurant on the premises -- we only had breakfast there but it was pretty good. It is apparently pretty hopping on a Saturday night. Two other things are worth noting: 1. The pool is tiny and won't get much sun -- it's not something you'll especially want to sun bath next next to, IMO, and I don't think it would satisfy kids. 2. Parking -- they have an underground lot that is extremely tight. Although I did see vans and SUVs parked there, I would be leery of bringing a large vehicle into the underground lot. They also have covered parking stalls under the building (entrance via the alley) -- these are also somewhat tight to park in and some (not all) require you to go over a sort of hump that actually scraped the chassis of my rental car, a Dodge Avenger (no visible damage, but I backed out and parked in another stall).

But I was sooo disappointed : 1. First there was indeed a smell. You know the same smell when you walk into a store selling vintage clothes. It's difficult to live in it. The smell was on the beds, on the towels, everywhere. 2. OK, the rate was $90 a night, but quality only worth $40. The wooden drawers were dirty and old. There were cracks here and there filled with dust and dirt. Towel racks were old with dots of paint, looked like they were covered with dirt. I had to use the towels on it and it gross me out. 3. Dirty dirty dirty. I'm serious, there was blood stain on pillow case, and the pillow itself was yellowish! We stayed for a night and we quickly moved out. We ended up at the \"Days Inn\" at Glendale which cost me only $75 per night, and believe me, Days Inn was way way better!!! I don't know, if you are always \"on the road\", always prepared to sleep at train stations, OK with not taking shower in days, then I think Laurel Hotel is good for you. But if you are a \"normal\" person who likes cleanliness, then don't ever think of going in there because it is not in hotel standard (not even motel standard compared to DAys Inn).", "Date": "September 16, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego, CA", "Title": "\u201cOK, good for the price\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2293910", "Content": "This hotel was basically what I expected for $100 a nite in West LA. The room we stayed in was smelly, pretty bad but not unbearable. The windows were kept open most of the time. The rooms were average size, a little shabby and worn but clean. The bathroom was clean but small and only had a shower. The pool was very cold (unheated) but since it was a hot weekend, it was refreshing. The main draw to this hotel is the price and the location. 5 minutes to the sunset strip, beverly hills and hollywood and right next to the grove, we walked to the farmers market for breakfast. It was a bit far from a freeway, and of course in LA that slows you down a lot.", "Date": "July 13, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "New South Wales, Australia", "Title": "\u201cAWESOME PLACE!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2241144", "Content": "The Beverly Laurel is fantastic!
