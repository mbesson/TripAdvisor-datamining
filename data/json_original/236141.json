I stayed here at the beginning and end of my trip, providing the chance to sample two different rooms. The first room was on the third floor and faced the street. This was out of range of the hotel's free WiFi, and posed the choice of either stuffiness, with the windows closed, or sleeplessness, as across the street below drunken young people talked noisily at all hours. The room's climate control functioned only to turn an internal fan on or off. My second room, also on the third floor, had good WiFi, and while facing an interior courtyard made for less of a view it also meant I could sleep with the windows open. The hotel staff were unfailingly polite and the hotel was clean.

It is well located as it is at a walking distance from the Termini Station (maybe 2-3 blocks away). When you first walk into the hotel it is a building shared with other hotels and businesses. The elevator is very small (one of those that you can see its structure and ropes) and it only fits about 2 people (that's without bags), so if you have a big party it's best to take the stairs. They do have a small communal area fit with a computer and internet access (which is very helpful in case you don't have a computer), as well complementary coffee, tea and orange juice. The room was small but well fitted, it had two twin beds, small comfortable bathroom, tv and cable. The main problem we had with the room was the smell. It seemed to be coming from the bathroom, and it was probably a sewage issue since it never went away. We tried to \"control\" the issues by putting towels on top of the drainage holes. Some of the staff was really nice, like the guy who checked us in, I believe his name was Mark, but the rest of the staff left something to be desired. Most of them had an attitude and seemed almost bothered by our presence. Overall, I was not very impressed with the customer service, with the exception of Mark.

The desk clerk, a charming man with a Brit accent, was welcoming and helpful. Although breakfast is not included, there is fresh fruit and bottled water in the room. The rate was good because it was non-refundable, so well within my budget.

The hotel is essentially run by 22 year olds who we found to be pretty unhelpful. Our first night at the Romae we closed our window, in spite of the great breeze, because the courtyard we were situated on was pretty loud and every sound echoed. We turned on the air conditioning, only to be woken up in pools of sweat two hours later, when HEAT was blowing out! My husband went to the desk and the employee apathetically told him that it was too early to turn on the air (last week of April) and that there was no fan. He came back to the room and we opened the window again. An hour later, we were awakened by Billy Joel blasting from the room across the courtyard. Again, my husband went to the desk (it was 1:00am) and was told \"it will stop soon,\" with no offer to ask the other guests to turn down their music. When the music didn't stop soon, my husband went into the courtyard, found a broom, and hit the window until they turned off the music. Every night there were noise disturbances (groups of touring high school spring break trips, for example) and the staff didn't seem to care that the entire building could hear the racket. The next day we inquired if the air in our room could be turned on, and a different employee said \"oh, yeah, um, let me call the manager.\" She either never did call, or she never felt like telling us that he said \"no, sweat it out with your window closed.\" Just a few SIMPLE improvements to customer service and this could be a great place, but for now, I wouldn't recommend it.", "Date": "May 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Island of Gozo, Malta", "Title": "\u201cvery nice hotel\u201d", "Author": "keki16", "ReviewID": "UR96916014", "Content": "We enjoyed our stay at this hotel.

The room was very clean upon arrival and we were happy with the daily up-keep cleaning. Our linens were replaced each day if they were dirty and left out. The size of the room was just a bit larger than your typical European hotel. We had a quadruple room which consisted of two twin beds pushed together to make one large bed. Never had any issues with the \"crack\" in the middle. There was another twin bed with a portable cot type bunk bed. I was a bit nervous about it's stability but it held up to our two rambunctious kiddos climbing around on it. We had an issue with two of the mattresses. One was extra squeeky and the other was seriously concave. We brought it to the staff's attention and during their cleaning service that day they were both replaced. MUCH BETTER! This is a small hotel with about 7 rooms on the first floor. I was concerned about out children being too loud for our neighbors but to my surprise, the walls seemed to be quite soundproof. The doors that access the hallway however, were not. The last two nights we were there we had neighbors that were oblivious to the fact that if you hold the door after you walk through it, it won't slam loudly and disturb your neighbors. We did not use the television. We did use the complimentary tea, coffee and juice service in the lobby and it was always delightful. Also, we took advantage of the wi-fi through our American iphones. The hotel was in a great neighborhood. Easy walking to the Termini, a supermarket, restaurants, various shops as well as several atm. (I highly recommend the pizza place across the street from the hotel on the corner of Via Palestro.) Our only complaint in regards to our stay here was that their was a nasty sewer smell that came from the bathroom any time we would use the water. It didn't seem to matter if it was the basin, shower or toilet. We mentioned it to the staff and they did try pouring bleach in the toilet but it didn't help. We were informed that the building is quite old and it is not unusual for this type of thing to happen. They did offer to move us to another room but we were at day 3 of our 5 day stay and I didn't want to pack everything up, unpack then repack 2 days later. We just made sure we kept our window open when we were there to alleviate the smell. Every one of the front desk staff was extremely helpful.

The fact that we could have our pick of about eight bus routes to take throughout the city, only a ten minute walk away, was very nice. I would warn others that the Hotel Romae is not smack in the center of the tourist sites though. It's a good ten minute bus ride (sometimes more) down to the sites, and the Vatican especially is a good hike on the bus. Technically you could walk to some sites (especially the Colosseum,) but it's not an extremely central location to the Campo di Fiori, Trastevere, or Piazza Navona (probably 45 minutes walking to those.)

The Romae is in a large former apartment building that houses three other hotels and B&Bs. However, we received a huge room with a renovated bathroom. Reading the other reviews, it clearly depends on which room you are given - all of which were converted from former apartments - as to how the hotel is rated. I, too, was aware of the funny smell when we arrived. I think this is more due to the sort of cleaning agents that Italians use rather then a desire to cover up anything. Once I opened the window - it vanished. We stayed for five days and it was like having our own small apartment in Rome. The staff are fantastic - organised airport transfers and tours, dealt with every query etc with charm and promptness. In a city known for its price-gouging, the Romae also stands out for offering free internet use, free coffee and tea round the clock, water in the room, really good toiletries that I wasn't expecting in a budget property and an in-room kitchen. The arrangement with the Yellow Room across the road for breakfast is very good. As another reviewer pointed out - for one euro more you can order a full English breakfast or omelette and the food and coffee is very good. Yes, it is close to Termini but that's fine if you are a walker. We walked all the way to the Piazza del Popolo without strain - let alone the Spanish Steps. I have to disagree with some of the reviewers re the surrounding restaurants. Two of them in particular - Mama Angela's and Il Leone di Abruzzo - should be avoided at all costs. The food and service are appalling in both. Farther down the street is Il Grappolo d'Oro - it's more expensive but the food is very good.

Plus: 1) Great location: within walking-with-luggage distance. The area is safe at night, with restaurants/supermarkets around the neighborhoods. Definitely good for travelers who just arrive for the first night and need something to eat/shop and then rest first. 2) Room is clean and modern with all the necessary amenities. 3) Staff was friendly and helpful. 3) A common lounge offering free water and fruit punch. Mention this because many hotels in Italy charge you even for water, quite unthinkable for US travelers. Free, available water is definitely appreciated especially after a long flight. 4) Free, in room WiFi: definitely valuable. 5) Free basket of fruits: definitely appreciated especially after a long flight or just traveling. Minus: 1) The room I had faces the street. Though the room has soundproof windows, still was hearing quite audible ambulances/police cars with sirens zooming by at night a few times. 2) The AC is not quiet in the room. Need to have it on with windows closed while sleeping at night; for otherwise, the room smells/feels stuffy (don't know whether the stuffiness was the reason for the beg-bug-like bites on my lower right leg the next morning or the bites were due to the long flight on the plane....) 3) The breakfast across the street at Yellow Bar isn't a good deal: Yellow Bar advertises that the continental breakfast costs $7 euro. But this free breakfast rates below average in all the free breakfasts offered during my one-week stay in Italy through different hotels in different cities. Basically, just yogurt + drink + croissant + bread. It probably is more like a $4/5 advertised value, so that you would feel spending an extra euro for the omelet combo instead. Would prefer that Romae instead takes this cost out of the room cost so that I can easily buy a good $7 breakfast myself. 4) In-room WiFi doesn't work, so travelers prepare to bring your own Internet cables! (or you can put down $5 deposit and return the cable when you check out to get the $5 back. Sensible, but still an annoyance). 5) I didn't know this, but get your power adapters before traveling to Italy, otherwise, put down another $5 deposit to get the adapter and return to get the deposit back, too. Or just go to the supermarket in the Roma Termini station to pick up a $2.60 adapter yourself during your stay. Hotel staff wasn't helpful in informing that we can simply go to supermarket ourselves to buy the adapter. All in all: a 7 out of 10 stay.

We even walked to the Vatican from Hotel Romae one day, stopping at many other notable spots along the way. Included breakfast is E7 at the restaurant across the street, which provided a serviceable, if not super great, breakfast.

They were very prompt with their response and gave me great directions. Check-in was a breeze. The rooms are small, but that is common for Europe. The room was very clean and neat and the bed was super comfy. The hotel room keycard must be inserted into the wall as you walk in to turn the lights on.

Our room was not big, but very comfortable and they took our preferences into account: we had asked for a quiet room with a double bed; we got both. The hotel is situated near the Terminus station and in the neighbourhood there are a lot of trattorias where you can eat on the terrace. The staff of the hotel was very friendly; on several occasions we asked some information about buses and so on, and they were always eager to help us. But we didn't know what was yet to come. On the last day of our stay, we had booked a boat trip that would last until 12.00 hours. We had arranged for somebody via the travel agency to bring us to the airport; this person would pick us up at 14.00 hours. Time enough, we thought. Unfortunately, only one day before, the agency warned us that we would be picked up one hour earlier. This meant we probably had to get back to the hotel in a hurry after the boattrip. And indeed, of course the trip started and ended later than it should, so we hurried back to the hotel. Our luggage stood ready in a special room. We only needed to go to the bathroom and then we could get into the waiting car. So I went into the bathroom, but left my camera in the room with our luggage. My mother told me later that in the mean time, somebody took his luggage out of the room. My camera must have fallen onto the floor by then. Any way, we took our luggage and got into the car. And only when we arrived at the airport, I realised my camera was missing. I called the hotel, and luckily they found it and would put it into their safe. Back in Holland, I sent an e-mail with my home address to the hotel. And guess what: they sent me the camera back by recommended post and we didn't have to pay anything!

Reading up on the Hotel Romae here and on LateRooms led me to believe they'd meet my expectations... but they far exceeded them. Communicating with the Hotel directly gave me a better rate than I found anywhere else, and all replies were prompt & helpful. Directions given from Termini were easy to follow, and it's a relatively short 4-block walk in a populated area to the right of the station. The check-in area is cute & very functional - coffee, tea, & hot milk fill 3 carafes in the bar area where there is also a computer for guest use. I found these to be available whenever I needed them, sometimes with no wait at all. As I chose not to pay extra for a fuller breakfast next door, I was very happy just to have hot drinks available - but juice is provided, and a small selection of packaged croissants & snacks was included during my stay as well. The rooms are arranged on the 4 upper floors - I was in a large single on the 4th floor. (404) The view was of the inner courtyard, and it was a quiet, spacious place to stay for 2 nights. The hotel carries the decoration style of its logo thru' all the rooms with the same artist's paintings, which made it very warm & inviting to return to after a day out in Rome. The bathroom was large, with a full bath, and all toiletries are provided - as well as a complimentary basket of fruit that was a very welcome gesture! (There is a mini-bar fridge, too) I found everyone at the front desk pleasant & helpful - providing maps, answering all questions ... even looking up local music events on line. Given the location, one can easily walk to the Colisseum and the Roman Forum, but frankly I found all the sights within acceptable walking distance from the Hotel and never felt unsafe at night upon returning. (Tho' all the usual precautions of travelling in any big city still apply) The bed was a standard European King Size (2 twins set together) and was very clean & comfortable ... when I return to Rome, I will definitely be returnung to the Hotel Romae!", "Date": "November 17, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Glasgow, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cHotel Romae was Brilliant!\u201d", "Author": "hallaway", "ReviewID": "UR10064933", "Content": "Stayed at Hotel Romae for a short break with my sister -in-law and mum-in-law.

The staff were very warm and welcoming and spoke English well. Our room (108) was a quad but there were just the three of us - plenty of room and closet space. The bathroom was nice as well, with soaps and shampoos and a GREAT shaving mirror that seriously showed every hair/blemish on your face - had a lot of fun with that. ;-) Free Tea/Coffee was available in the lobby as well as free internet access, and there was a great little sitting area outside (accessed through the lobby). Water was available for \u20ac1/bottle in a cooler in the reception area. We opted not to go for the b&b at Mama Angelo's and I'm really glad about that - we had dinner there the first night and sorry, it was horrible food. (Waiters were nice, but the food was pretty awful.) There is a Bar Yellow across the street from Hotel Romae which is great for a coffee/tea in the morning and a wee drink at night. The beds were comfortable and the rooms had free Sky - there was also a fruit basket on the table when we arrived. It was very clean and the maid service was wonderful each day. The decor was tasteful and in line with our expectations of Rome. We were very comfortable in Hotel Romae and it's a great bargain.

Positive points concerning this hotel: Great location just 3 or 4 easy walking blocks from the Termini railway station; nice, very clean and cool rooms with tall ceilings; our queen size bed was two firm single beds together which gave plenty of room; small fridge and small safe in room; small fruit basket on arrival (a nice touch); free internet access in the reception area along with tea/coffee available all day; ample supply and good variety for continental type breakfast (in the restaurant next door). Staff were friendly and helpful. They even allowed us to store 2 large suitcases while we ventured to Northern Italy for 4 nights. The location provided for a choice of several good restaurants/trattorias/pizzeria in the immediate area, a laundry-mat and of course the pub opposite. Overall it was good value for money. The only disappointing thing concerning this property was that our second stay was in a room at the front of the property over looking the road and the pub opposite and this made for a very noisy night, despite it being a Sunday night. Our room for our first stay was towards the back of the property and much quieter. Their pillows are also very poor being very hard and flat. Asking for another one didn't solve this issue and it is probably time they replaced them all. But in hindsight this is only a small thing really. Would I go back to this hotel?

We had 5 nights there. good - friendly staff; clean rooms; proximity to the station; good food in the area, Mama Angelos night time restaurant is excellent; fruit basket on arrival;discount cards for dinner at Mama A's; empty fridge for own use;free tea, coffee and juice in lounge; divine pizza's across the road, sold by weight;goodies in bathroom, not even found in some of the more upmarket places we were in; bad - rooms are tiny (well, ours was), bathroom even smaller (1m x 3m), and you had to sit on the loos sideways!; free tea coffee and juice always either empty or cold (nice idea tho); there are other hotels in the same building, so it's quite noisy. Our first night we were kept awake by a school group which apparently came from another hotel;the lift doesn't always work, we were on the third floor and it was a big ask to get up those stairs for some of us;we were a little iffy about the area after dark, so we liked to be back in the immediate vicinity by then, but that just may be our South African paranoia coming to the fore; Our overall impression is that for a budget hotel the Romae is an excellent bet. if you're not bothered any of the bads above it's a brilliant little hotel. If you like things a little more up market, and would like to experience more of the Roman nightlife, perhaps it would be better to head further away from the station. Note: breakfast neither bad or good - adequate enough, but things were not replenished when they ran out, so we often didn't eat very much. Early Breakfast (for those leaving early flights/trains) is a stale roll, and coffee (the latter was very very good!). I wouldn't bother.

The hotel is five minute walking distance from Termini train station. It was very conveinant to catch the shuttle bus to Ciamprino airport from the train station. There is also another train stop that is only a few minutes away. I loved the free internet except it was sometimes a long wait to get on the computer.
