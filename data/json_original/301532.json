We were taken from Dubai airport to a seedy rear hotel entrance - we were tired after flying all night and knew we would have to wait until noon before getting our room.. OK we were allowed to leave our luggage and go for a walk to the beach - which was most uninteresting an then had to kill time. We were shown to the first room - which smelled strongly of heavy tobacco - we had to refuse as we had requested non-smoking. We then had to wait for another room which was not much better. It was freezing cod - like walking into a Cold store and had to open the windows to let warm air in. This is unthinkable in Dubai. We tried the lights and there was no masterswitch near the door. We then discovered it was at the side of the bed. Also there were wires taped up on the other side and we were horrified to think of the safety issues. We asked for the air Con. to be fixed and nobody knew how to fix it - so we switched the whole thing off. To have breakfast we requested for 4.30am and this was duelly delivered and was the best part of the experience. We then went on our way travelling.

It is a small hotel, but excellently located, on a quiet street in a residential neighborhood. It is right on the public beach, next to the Dubai Marina. The water is about 300 yards from the hotel, and is one of the cleanest beaches I have ever been to. The water is crystal clear, and the beach sand is fine and easy to walk on barefooted. There are also lifeguards on duty at the beach. We were fortunate to have one of the two balcony rooms facing the beach, so our view was awesome! The amenities include a small heated pool and an exercise room filled with equipment. The staff were very helpful and attentive, and absolutely a joy to deal with. The only drawback was that our room was right next to the hotel's Ali Baba Restaurant, and the restaurant rocks with middle eastern merry making until the wee hours. This made sleeping with the balcony sliding door open very difficult, and closing the door helped, but did not eliminate the noise entirely. Regardless, I would enthusiastically recommend this hotel, and would stay there again if we ever return to Dubai. I'm sure other rooms in the hotel are much quieter. It is a short walk from the Jumeirah Mosque, which is a must see! Four days a week, the Mosque invites non-Muslims to visit and learn about Islam. If you go there, be sure to participate in the ablution ritual washing. It will help you get into the spirit of the visit, and connect with the guides. The hotel is also a short cab ride from the Dubai Mall and the Burgh Kalifah, the tallest building in the world. Breakfast at the hotel is interesting, including a mix of local (french toast made from pita, Arab pancakes, Arab cucumbers, \"beef bacon\", hummus) and non-local (baked beans, scrambled eggs) entrees. We did not eat at the \"Alii Baba\" Restaurant, but would have if we had more time in Dubai.

The problem with this hotel is it appears that it has lost it's identity as a hotel as it concentrates more on its restaurant custom. When we checked in we were told that we had been upgraded at no extra cost to a superior room on the understanding that if they needed the room we would have to vacate! It was very late and in order to get our heads down after a long flight we accepted. The room itself was a good size and very clean. Unfortunately however during our entire stay we were unable to open our curtains or patio doors as this looked directly out onto a table within the restaurant! I must point out that the photographs of the hotel on the website are not a good representation of the Regent Beach Hotel. The open communal area has been taken over by a large \u2018Ali Baba\u2019 tent which houses a smoking area and restaurant. It appears that the hotel has utilised every morsel of space which directly impacts on the overall comfort of the hotel. Where at one point the superior room would have had its own patio, this has now been utilised as part of the Ali Baba tent!! It wouldn\u2019t have been so bad but Dubai is a fantastic place, it would just have been nice to be able to open the curtains in order to know whether it was daylight or evening....very disorientating. I found myself not wanting to go back to the hotel on some occasions as the \u2018Tent\u2019 area remained open quite late and it really did feel like people were in our room as we could hear their conversations perfectly!! To be fair, I can\u2019t say it spoilt our holiday as I still made the most of it but I suppose forewarned is forearmed. With two days to go we received the phone call from reception....we need the superior room back, you have to get out. The receptionist was very matter of fact and basically told us at 9am that we had to pack and get out of our room ASAP. To be honest, due to the problems with the room we didn\u2019t make a fuss and simply asked for the key to our new room. It was at this point that we were told that a bell boy would fetch our case as our room wouldn\u2019t be ready until 3pm!!

Right beside the beach which has police presence/life guard on duty and sunbed rental, there are also 2 refreshment kiosks, yes it it close to dubai dock area but not too distracting.(Go other side of promenade) Location of hotel means that a taxi to city sights i.e. gold souks / markets / sail on the creek etc. work out about 3 pounds sterling each way, opposite direction takes you straight down the beach road to other attractions (wild wadi / mall of emirates / madinet etc. ) work out a price with your driver, maybe 5 pounds . Hotel itself very clean and tidy , room cleaned every day, b/fast bar ok (omlettes made to order) internet access in reception and airport pick up can be organised. (our flight was over 1 hr late got in around 11.30 p.m. & still got welcomed with smiling face by driver.) Eating in the hotel could be quite expensive but only in line with other hotel eateries.

For a beach holiday its situation is great with a very nice sandy beach right outside the front. There are plenty of shops in close proximity and taxis are not expensive. The swimming pool was fine (a little cold)and if you wished to eat at the hotel there was a choice of Indian or Moroccan - I recommend the latter. The staff were always friendly and helpful. The breakfast wasn't much to right home about but edible. We did have to wait for our room having arrived early in the morning and we were put on the groundfloor without a view. Occasionally this was a little noisy from guests coming in late but on the up side we did not have any disturbance from the building work that is going on all over Dubai nor the planes as the airport is close. Cost in a metered taxi and from the hotel shuttle was the same for 2 persons (50 Dinars in total). Our room was cleaned every day and for us was fine in size with 2 large beds. The hotel is non alcaholic which may put some people off but you can get a drink at mealtimes. Here is a little tip for those that would like a refreshing beer/cider etc outside mealtimes. If you walk from the street down to the royal marine hotel (a 5 minute walk) right next door is a tex mex restaurant that sells all the usual lagers/beers/spirits. It has a great lunch special (29 dinars for food and a pint- just over \u00a34) and has happy hour 1200 - 1900 during the week except fridays and 1200 - 2100 on the weekend. This was an ideal watering hole very close to the hotel. If you are planning any trips I would strongly recommend the dune safari. The drivers perform extraordinary skills to keep the 4 wheel drive vehicles going and not being rolled. A great adrenaline kick. This can be booked from the hotel along with other attractions.

It was fine, a single bed that just about allowed the wardrobe door to open, air con that worked well, TV with many channels including BBC World. The bathroom was a little sparse and the towels had seen better days, but the water pressure was good and the toiletries OK too. The hot water was exceedingly hot, dangerously so I felt. My rate included breakfast, and the buffet looked fine, although the only day I ate more than cereal (I'm supposed to be on a diet!), the food was cold. The location was good and staff seemed very helpful, although I did have trouble on the last day. I had booked an early morning call for 6:30 and a shuttle to the airport for 7. The evening before I was asked to change my departure to 6.30 as another couple were leaving then. I agreed and asked for the call to be changed to 6. It arrived at 6.20, but luckily I had set the alarm on my mobile phone and was already up. When I got to reception I was put, alone, into a taxi and sent on my way. I never even saw the other couple!

Had spent a considerable amount to time researching a suitable \"budget\" hotel and was disappointed - despite being realistic about what to expect after doing lots of research! I was unable to find an email address to book the hotel mini-bus on the way out so paid for a taxi tout at a negotiated rate - the journey takes about 20 mins but can be much more if the traffic is bad! Utilised the mini-bus service going back to the airport the following day and it was very reasonable - 20Dh I think. I was pleasantly surprised to be allowed into my room at 10.30am and had prepared myself not to be able to get in until 2pm (arrived at 8.30am). I spent the morning asleep in one of the \"tents\" in the garden and wasn't disturbed which was a relief. However I was disappointed with my room - the carpet was dirty and the bedside lamp didn't work. Also the bedroom and bathroom were slightly below ground level which made the room very dark and if you wanted any privacy you had to keep the curtains closed as everyone walking by could look in (despite nets!). Furthermore the bathroom window vent (which was in the top of the wall) didn't shut properly due to an extractor fan and everyone in the outdoor reception area could look in and see/hear everything! Had a nasty shock when showering at 6am the following morning before going to the airport as there was only a very (very) limited amount of hot water....!! Not sure if i didn't get a better room because I was a single traveller and I was only staying for one night.....it's just something to bear in mind as the hotel didn't seem particularly full! However I didn't complain as I was just too tired and just wanted to sleep! The location was great for the beach - just a 2 minute walk away - across the car park, a small road and you are on the beach. Which was great to relax on before preparing myself for a 14 1/2 hour flight to Melbourne. Taxi's to and from the souks were reasonable and regular, it's not the law to wear seatbelts in the back in UAE however felt for my own safety that it was a wise decision!

It is apparently the only 3 star on Jumeirah Beach - thus \"cheap.\" We were consistently disappointed by how good the place COULD be but was, unfortunately, not. Check-in was not handled well - there were many people who through early flights or for other reasons had arrived in the morning. Not only were rooms not available, and the tiny lobby (the only air-conditioned place - very welcome in August in Dubai) overflowing with unhappy people in every available space, the hotel staff did not offer any suggestions. We figured there had to be a restaurant and once we found it, we were able to wait there, drink a juice, and at least relax with a nice view of the ocean. The restaurant took us 15 minutes to find and no one offered any help. If the staff had instructed people to wait there if they liked (and, if the hotel had gone one extra step and offered people one complimentary juice) you would have seen much happier folks instead of the miserable lobby scene. We were eventually given a \"suite\" since there were no vacancies of regular rooms even later in the day, though we were told we would have to move \"in a day or two.\" As we were 2 adults and an infant who had been living in Africa for a year (and therefore, with a fair bit of luggage), this meant we couldn't really relax as we did not know if or when we'd be asked to move. If I had actually been paying for a suite, I would have vacated the premises immediately - while large, it was terribly shabby. The room we were eventually moved to was large and had a great view of the beach but smelled so toxic - not sure what caused it and, at that point, complaining didn't seem useful. The guy who helped us move our luggage (3 times that week!) was the most wonderful person. It seems as though someone decided to \"upgrade\" the hotel by spending too much money on plasma televisions which were tacked up in very awkward places in the restaurant. The most galling aspect, to me, was the junk EVERYWHERE - tucked in every conceivable corner. It was a veritable hazardous waste site just behind the pool with all sorts of chemicals, paints, cleansers, etc. jumbled in full-view. Broken washing machines around one corner, luggage carts left all over the sidewalk, cigarette butts all around the pool. The restaurant, where we ate our complimentary breakfasts, needed a good cleaning. The food was a disappointment too - especially after our previous hotel (the Hallmark) and it's excellent buffet. Instead of offering a whole range of local foods (cheap and widely available), they concentrated on bad \"English\" breakfast choices. Basically, this place needs better management.
