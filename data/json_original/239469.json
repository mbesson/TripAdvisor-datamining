Many other budding followers were also in the dam, making accomodation scarce to say the least. After trawling tourist information, we stumbled upon ''HOTEL KABUL'', which supprisingly enough, had vacaincies. All six of us hurried ahead and entered THE KABUL. We were met at reception by two shifty looking turkish men, who neither raised a smile or an eyebrow to greet us. We was then told it was 35 euros each for a night stay, but we immediately accepted, pleased that we had a roof over our heads for the night. As we were led to our shared 8-man room, we noticed what could only be described as large pockets of bullet holes in the walls. Upon realising we had our pants trulley pulled down with a 35 euro cost, we dumped our bags (after taking out valuables), and got ready to hit the city life. We shared the room with to american wanderers who on our arrival, were combing the beds for bedbugs. We decided our only option was to get blind drunk in order to block out the horrific surroundings/decor. When i awoke, after a heavy night, i was unsure of my bearings and half expected to see Gary Glitter, as it was reminisent of a cambodian prison!!! I would therefoe NOT reccomend anyone to endure a night of pure punishment and the hands of the KABUL staff.", "Date": "June 10, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brooklyn, NY", "Title": "\u201cScary!\u201d", "Author": "CarpeNoctum_23", "ReviewID": "UR30812585", "Content": "My friend and I went on a little weekend budget trip to Amsterdam and decided to stay at Kabul as a way to save money.

Don't know, but we went back to the room with our bags and some crazy old man that we were sharing the room with started screaming at us.

This place was actually about average on the cleanliness scale for a hostel. The carpets are stained, and it's a bit dingy, but it is located dead center in the Red Light, so I wasn't expecting posh accommodations. The bathrooms were sanitary and serviceable, and while the blankets and sheets were worn they had been washed recently. I've honestly stayed in much, much filthier hostels and you have a decent view of the canals in the room we stayed in, which was one of the large 8 bed rooms. My real problem was with the staff. We stayed here 5 days, and on the morning of the second day we were out the door pretty early. In the lobby, one of the clerks and an Italian woman (looked to be a teenager) were screaming and fighting with each other. I have no idea what they were fighting about, but the clerk kicked this woman in the chest and sent her sprawling onto the ground where she could hardly breathe. I'm sure being a hotel clerk in this part of Amsterdam can be trying, but I've never seen anyone just make the jump from an argument to physical violence in a business setting like that. It definitely scared us, and had we not foolishly paid in advance, we would have left and found somewhere else to stay.", "Date": "September 23, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wroc\u00c5\u201aaw", "Title": "\u201cIf you got choise go somewhere else\u201d", "Author": "chlondziu", "ReviewID": "UR14933239", "Content": "When I arrived with my friend to this [--] hostel 2 girls from Argentina were accommodated. they were very friendly and very helpful and that will be all good thinks with this hostel.

Does the overpowering aroma of urine set your heart racing? Does the prospect of housing nightly insect feasts on your own flesh fill you with joy? Perhaps sleeping in sauna temperatures whilst fearing for the health consequences of daring to open a window is more your style? Or maybe you just like to be woken by the delightful and unique screechings of the local pigeon turf wars? Is having incompetent and unfriendly staff a real turn on? If some or all of these enticing propositions form your Amsterdam accomadation checklist, and providing you have the relevent outdoor persuits qualifications necessary to scale the stairs, then the aptly-named \"Hotel\" Kabul your ideal Dutch experience. On arriving in Amsterdam we were turned away from our intended accomadation and instead were put up in the smaller less enticing surroundings of Hotel Kabul. However, the similarities with the nativity tale did not end there, as we were amazed to discover the range of wildlife that greeted us in the stable-like conditions of Kabul. Our view overlooking the courtyard of rotting Pigeon corpses was particularly striking, though the impression this left on us was perhaps less tangible than that left by the insects who relentlessly chewed their way through our party during our stay. We were especially perplexed by the dilema posed to us by the intense heat of our room. With the only window opening directly onto \"pigeon yard\" we were faced with a grim choice that ended in a combination of both foul smelling odours and heavy sweating as we attempted to strike an impossible balance. Whilst the pigeons revelled in their lively role of waking us at sunrise, the Hotel staff were somewhat less spirited and provided a sullen, dull, and unhelpful attitude that was entirely inkeeping with the general ambience of Kabul (city and hotel). The fact that i am not discussing at length the shortcomings of the decoration, the furnishings, security, the food, the stairs, the general hygene, and the toilet and shower facilities is reflective of the more concerning challenges provided during a stay at Hotel Kabul. Kabul is not a hotel to be taken lightly and guests should be aware of the battles that will await them upon arrival.

This Hostel scares me, how do the owners manage to keep this place open? Horrible dirty rooms, never touched, sticky pattern carpet which was red now thick black. Windows only washed by rain (both sides). Pigeons!! Bunk beds are cheep old nasty metal affairs that are well past it, with thin soiled and knackered matresses. Roof leaks which caused water to run down the light fitting onto a bunk! I'm not writing anymore as I am trying to forget!!

Apart from being very close to our most regular haunt (The Grasshopper), I don't really have any further positives to comment upon. The stairs are incredibly steep (not the easiest of challenges after 10 hours in the coffee shops) and our window was propped open with a rotting plank which we daren't remove through fear of structural collapse.
