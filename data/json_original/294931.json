The rooftop terrace offered wonderful views of the sea and the Blue Mosque. The location - just around the corner from the Blue Mosque and Hagia Sofia - could not be beat. The breakfast, on the rooftop terrace, was the perfect mix of regular continental and Turkish items. The room (503) was very clean and also offered a view of the sea.

The staff was amazingly hospitable and kind as well (and VERY quick to respond to emails). All in all, however, this was one of the strangest hotels that I have ever stayed in. The decor and ambiance was fairly reminiscent of my grandmother's house, so that while the four-poster bed was very romantic, the faded, damask wallpaper, heavy antique furniture and general silence cast a particular gothic/ghostly aura over our stay. The jacuzzi was great to have, but it did take some time to fill up, as there was not enough hot water to fill it up in one turn. Instead, I was able to fill it about half way, went to breakfast and managed to complete the job upon return to the room. The breakfast was very good and the view from the terrace was stellar. My only real complaint with this hotel was with the location, which of course is beyond their control. The street was very quiet (dead, really) and the neighborhood in general rather deserted at night, yet heavy with tourists by day, and there was a lack of quality restaurants and cafes in the area. I didn't feel like I really began to acquaint myself with Istanbul until I left Dersaadet, and my boyfriend and I found ourselves much more at home in vibrant Beyoglu and urban Nisantasi. The prices were very reasonable, I felt, until we were able to relocate to somewhere much more posh and even larger (another corner suite) for a little less per night.", "Date": "April 17, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "G\u00c3\u00b6teborg", "Title": "\u201cA beautiful and friendly hotel with a great location.\u201d", "Author": "Kristina_8486", "ReviewID": "UR127915164", "Content": "We stayed in this lovely little Turkish hotel in the beginning of April during four nights and couldn't be more pleased with our booking.

The room was not so big, but we were fond of the Turkish style and it was clean and cosy. The restaurant on the top was excellent with a nice view over the Bosporous and the Blue mosque. The chef of the restaurant is a very symphatetic man and is worth a special thanks for his treatment of the guest! They serve a home-made breakfast and you have the choice to sit either outside or inside. Then you can go up and sit there during the day to take a beer or a glass of wine until 23.30 if you like. The hotel is perfectly situated in the old part of Istanbul, in Sulthanamet. Walking distance to all the monuments like the Blue Mosqe, Topkapi Palace, Grand Bazar and Hagia Sophia. There is nothing but good things to say about this hotel and if we come back we would definitely choose it again. Well, maybe - we are from the north and like to sleep when it is a bit chilly in the bedroom. There was no good air condition in the room and it was a bit warm I have to say.

There are minarets, with muezzins calling the faithful to prayer that ring out across the city. It is like delving back thousands of years to the Roman, Byzantine and Ottoman eras. Mind boggling at times. There are some very good restaurants, (the local wine is very acceptable) and there is a very useful shopping street. There is a beautiful water front where on a Sunday you can observe almost all the inhabitants of the city taking a stroll, having picnics and just relaxing. The people are friendly, energetic, often funny. There was a real mix of people and all in all it there was a wonderfully tolerant air about the place.

Sitting on its rooftop terrace overlooking the Blue Mosque either by day over breakfast or by night sipping a cocktail is truly magical. The hotel's staff, though, is what really shines here. You never see a sour face on any one, and there is nothing that can not or will not be done for you as a guest. From the front desk staff Umit, Sameet, and Mehmet, to the Concierage Gozde with her \"killer\" shoes, to the waiters Umit and Mehmet, to the cleaning staff, to the owner, all exude warmth and graciousness, and a real passion and pleasure to make your stay as comfortable as possible. Because we had to leave early for the airport on our return home and the breakfast service had not yet opened, they arranged tea, coffee, and sandwiches for us in the lobby. By accident one of my brothers left a set of tea glasses he had bought in his room, and the next day the hotel sent them on to him, arriving in perfect condition.

He must have spent over half-hour with us or more just discussing sights to see and the best possible route of travel; the staff including Umit at front desk were fully customer focused - as an example, our 4.5 year daughter had seen candy one morning at front desk but that particular morning, the candy had run out.

Not to worry, a driver was waiting for us! It made our arrival so stress-free. The hotel itself was a bit smaller than I expected--I'm not sure why. We booked a corner suite that was furnished with a mix of old and newer pieces. The bed was very comfortable, and the bathroom was updated and spotless. The roof terrace is charming and a nice place for a drink late in the day, as well as breakfast. The breakfast, included in the tariff, had a lot of hot and cold options. One note: bring earplugs if the call to prayer is likely to disturb your early morning sleep. The staff is wonderful. In advance of the trip I requested suggestions for tour groups for a day in Gallipoli. I received recommendations from the Dersaadet for several companies, and the one we chose was excellent. One night the computer available in the lobby for guests wasn't working properly, and the very friendly front desk attendant let me use the hotel's computer to check my email. Staff helped us arrange taxis and gave us some very good tips for restaurants and sightseeing. When I started to write my review, it had four stars. The hotel is not a high end luxury hotel--for that, try the Four Seasons, just down the road.

There was plenty of hot water. The rooftop terrace has an awesome view of the Sea of Marmara and a good view of the Blue Mosque. What a lovely place for breakfast each morning! The breakfast was very good with fresh fruit, cheeses, breads, eggs, meat and the traditional olives, tomatoes and cucumbers. We also came back to the terrace a couple of evenings after dinner for a glass of wine to recap our fabulous day of sightseeing.

And while he was here, we decided to take a three day trip to Istanbul. We stayed at the Dursaadet Hotel, and the hotel itself is lovely. The majority of the staff were cordial, helpful and went out of their way to assist in any way they could. We booked two rooms - both on a single basis, but in a double room, and paid for this facility. When we arrived, one person was asked to 'volunteer' to take the Sultan's suite for the night! Well - we flipped a coin and one of us had such a lovely room! It is quite a fantastic room. The downside of this upgrade what that the person who stayed in the suite had to move to another room for the second night. This room was also nice, albeit much smaller, as you would expect. Minibar, coffee & tea and safe in the room, all as promised. The other room however, was a disappointment. There was no coffee or tea, and the shower was extremely small. But there was a mini-bar and small television. The big problem was that the airconditioning did not work on the first night. The management was able to have it fixed by the second night - just before bed time! We were also disappointed when we asked to be recommended to a 'good' fish restaurant for our second evening. The hotel organised transportation to a restaurant named 'Fener Fish Restaurant'. The transportation was a nice bonus - but the restaurant was awful! They started with showing us the appetisers on a tray - all soggy and un-appetising! And made a point of telling us that they would certainly bring us 'fresh' portions!!! We decided not to eat there - and we were really glad we did! This restaurant is in the 'fish area' - which is a collection of restaurants near the fish market. They are highly commercial and although some may have good fish, the overwhelming of 'old fish' was everywhere; so if you go there, be careful where you eat! The Dersaadet is a nice hotel. They try hard to please their guests and it is spotlessly clean. The breakfast is quite nice and the views from the roof top verandah / breakfast room are lovely. Some of the staff need a reminder of the term 'customer service'! But this was really only one person, and the front desk wanted to know all about our experiences so they could make improvements.

Overall staff could not have been more helpful and provided good advice and able to answer many questions. So pleasant and nothing was too much trouble a real gem from that aspect. In the foyer there was a laptop providing free internet access for those without there own. Foyer had free wifi as well. Breakfast on the top floor with views of the Blue Mosque and Sea of Mamara, even saw a pod of dolphins from the terrace. Breakfast self service with some hot food and continental with everything you might wish. Freshly squeezed orange juice to order at an extra cost (I noted someone says it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t available, maybe they meant for free) Location is brilliant, about 4 minute walk to Blue Mosque and all central sights in Istanbul. Only very tiny comment is that the rooms are quite small and yes the curtains did not completely close but did meet in the middle but adequate for a city break. Bathroom was also small but clean, modern and very good shower. Our room had a view over the Sea of Marmara but I can see there were some with a side or back view. You do not need a hire car, everything can be accessed by walking and use the trams at a standard fare of 1.75TL. We went to Gallipoli for the day and it was expensive, a major trek, left at 0630, got back at 10.30pm. Our guide was not particularly good, we went with New Deal and I would choose someone else. They use TJs in Gallipoli who is highly recommended but our battlefield guide was not as good as the others we overheard. This hotel deserves its rating on trip advisor, it is a shown as a four star but I am not sure the hotel would claim that, good three star but do not be put off, you really good do worse. Like all cities there are cheaper hotels further out of the city centre but it is in a prime position and no doubt there are many more expensive hotels which are more modern and with better luxury. I have travelled a lot on business and stayed in some smart hotels at a price! Obviously we ate out every night and what was interesting was the price difference for the same dishes from restaurant to restaurant for the same quality and quantity, look carefully.. Interestingly while we stayed there the hotel was full, about of just about every European nationality and from USA so that must say something.

We were there for our honeymoon (we got married on the 31st of March) and wanted something cozy, personal and very romantic. We were not disappointed. It's a very nice hotel with AWESOME staff, especially Samet & Umit from the front desk. On the second day of our stay, Deniz (the owner) called us and asked whether we need anything or whether we would like anything to be changed in the room. They have free pickup from the airport but no drop off... which doesn't make sense when you've just handed them $1,700. The location is perfect, it's very close to the blue mosque and a little further along are the Hagia Sofia and Topkapi palace. I found their breakfast to be a bit plain so we would go down to this brilliant place called the Marmara Cafe which is just a 2 minute walk from the hotel. On the fourth morning, Umit asked me what I liked at the Cafe and offered to have it made and sent up to my room. And although their menemen wasn't as great as Marmara Cafe's, it was still pretty good. At any rate, it's all a matter of personal taste so I can't hold it against them. On the suite front, it isn't actually a suite. It's a room. And although largely nicely done, it still needs some attention, especially as it's their most expensive room. The lighting could have been better, the curtains aren't very good and didn't roll all the way up and the shower door rubber seal had broken so unless you're careful, you can easily flood the bathroom. I'm sure they would have fixed them had i asked them to but why should I? This is why I've given them 4 stars instead of 5. Had they taken care of all these very, very minor things before I came, I would definitely have given them a 5. I did tell them though that it was very dark in the room so they sent up three extra lamps which helped... a bit. The view from the room was excellent though.

The hotel itself is in a great location for walking to the Topkapi Palace, the Bazaar and the Hagia Sophia within only a few minutes. Nearest, though, is the Blue Mosque, which you can see clearly from the rooftop terrace where breakfast is served. We can recommend this place really highly, for what we paid, we got exceptional value: it was spotlessly clean, our room was large, tastefully decorated and the bathroom even had a jacuzzi. The nightlife nearby isn't on the same scale as on the Galata (north) side, but there are still plenty of good restaurants two or three streets away and places within 5 minutes for late drinks.

That evening we came back to find a lovely basket of fruit, nuts, wine and Turkish delights in our room. These touches make it so much easier to get settled into a new locale. In buying a home, the goal is \"location, location, location\" and again Dersaadet gets an A. You can easily walk to the most popular tourist spots-Blue Mosque, Topkapi Palace, Grand Bazaar, Hagia Sophia, the Underground Cistern, Istanbul Archaelogical Museum, Turkish and Islamic Arts Museum--there are more archaelogical relics than you can imagine could exist in one area.

The hotel itself has charming and comfortable rooms with wonderful bedding (you can request a Marmara Sea view) and a wonderful glass surround rooftop terrace (with indoor or outdoor dining) where breakfast, snacks and incredible views of the sea and historical sites abound.

Booking on-line was easy, the staff was responsive, and when I gave the wrong arrival time for our airport pick-up, I sent a hasty email the day of our flight -- to which they immediately responded, assuring me that I would be picked up on time. It was a relief to see the driver there as soon as we entered the arrivals hall. The entire staff was terrific, and we especially enjoyed dealing with Umit, the front office manager. He greeted us each morning with a sunny smile and was always willing to offer advice on sites, restaurants, and anything else we cared to ask. The Dersaadet is perfectly located -- about five minutes from the Blue Mosque and in a pleasant and fairly quiet neighborhood with several good restaurants (I'd recommend Doy Doy, Tamara, Buhara 93, and a restaurant across from Buhara with a fountain courtyard where Turkish men were smoking fragrant apple nargiles and playing backgammon.) We booked a corner suite, which was spacious and charmingly decorated, with a big four poster for me and a (slightly less comfortable) day-bed for my daughter. The nicely-appointed bathroom was roomy, with a jacuzzi and shower. The room had five windows, letting in lots of sunshine and fresh air. Free wireless internet was a big plus. I would suggest spending the extra money for a corner suite because the neighboring room looked quite small. A substantial buffet breakfast is served in a sunny room and terrace at the top of the hotel, with chirping parakeets to accompany your morning coffee. The fare includes various breads, cereal, scrambled and boiled eggs, sausage, (cold) french fries, cheeses, cold cuts, fresh fruit, yoghurt, olives, cucumbers, tomatoes, juices and hot drinks -- something for every taste. I would suggest that they also offer fresh-squeezed seasonal fruit juices -- something you can get on nearly every block. The breakfast attendant was friendly and efficient. One morning when a couple arrived 10 minutes before breakfast was over and the scrambled eggs had just been finished off (by me), the attendant made sure they got freshly cooked omlettes. All in all, we have a terrific time in Istanbul, and much credit goes to the Dersaadet and its staff for making our stay so memorable.", "Date": "February 21, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sussex", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Location, but overrated on TripAdvisor reviews\u201d", "Author": "Mary014", "ReviewID": "UR56160685", "Content": "We booked this hotel based on reviews on Tripadvisor and were disappointed with the room we had.

It also looked like it needed some redecoration - particularly in the bath area - although it was warm all the time. The bed was very hard and we mentioned this to the friendly receptionist and they put some padding so it was more comfortable. We booked a transfer from Sabiha Gocken @ 50 euros - really thats average price - all on time. If you haven't booked your flight yet, don't bother booking easyjet unless you are happy to pay this each way with an hour's transfer. The other airport is very close. The weird thing though is that the hotel would let you put the pick up on the bill but not the return if you are paying by credit card - very strange and they couldn't seem to explain it very well. The hotel has an amazing location just a stones throw from all the good sights, the palace, blue mosque and haghia sophia not forgetting the grand bazaar which is so much fun. At night it was very safe. If you are looking for good nightlife - go out to Tunel on the other side of the river - you'll pay somewhere between 12-18 Turkish Lira in a taxi. Great fun though.

This room certainly lived up to the hotel's photos. We found it to be stylish, plush and very spacious. The bathroom is similarly roomy and reasonably well-appointed, and most importantly, clean. The balcony is quite small although we had little use for it in December, other than putting out a little bread for the seagulls. There is a little bit of urban blight in the view, but mostly we looked out to the harbor and scarcely noticed anything else. There is a minaret close by which may be a bit loud for some, but we did not find it disturbing. One of the hotel's few shortcomings is its selection of food. Quality is reasonable, but choices are minimal. The breakfast buffet has but a few items and the room service menu is limited to club sandwiches, omelettes, and french fries. However, there are several dining options, including take-away, within a few blocks of the hotel. Location is a major plus for the hotel. In addition to convenient food options, several major attractions are less than ten minutes away by foot. Better still, the walk from the hotel to the sights requires passing only one salesman (in front of the Turkish bath) and he's so quiet and polite that he barely qualifies as a hawker by Istanbul standards. The hotel staff was extremely friendly and handled all of our needs with competence and courtesy. We needed transfers to two different airports and both were on time.

They organized our return transport to the airport at a very reasonable fee - likewise for our return we did not pay much for pick up and return to the airport. The rooms are spotless - clean, pretty and pleasantly decorated. We had rooms 503 and 501. On our arrival the second time (room 503) we noticed an unpleasant smell in the bathroom. I reported this to the staff and I don't know what they did, but it was very quickly taken care of and we were perfectly content. The beds were very firm, extra blankets available if needed, a safe in the room, great views of the Marmara Sea. The staff could not possibly have been friendlier or kinder. We felt like they really were interested in making sure we enjoyed ourselves. Our friends left at 5am on their last day and the staff offered them a cup of tea while they waited for the driver! The views from the terrace were lovely - especially the Blue Mosque in the evening. Breakfasts were tasty with a bit of variety every morning - and home made pastries every day. The coffee was good too (and we live in Italy so our standards are pretty high!) We had tea or coffee every day after sight seeing and before dinner, and it was lovely to relax on the terrace, either inside or outside. There is also free internet which was nice to have, and there were tables and chairs for socializing. The location is fantastic - a five minute walk to the hippodrome and the Blue Mosque, 15 mintues to the tram, close to restaurants and ATMs. I would go back to the Dersaadet at the drop of a hat!", "Date": "September 18, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Viterbo, Italy", "Title": "\u201cThe perfect spot to discover Istanbul\u201d", "Author": "maociu", "ReviewID": "UR41973136", "Content": "We spent 3 nights at the Dersaadet and enjoyed every moment of our stay.

It was convenient for walking to the Blue Mosque, the Hagia Sofia, and a tram stop, yet a few blocks away so that the street was not filled with tourists. There were several convenient restaurants nearby which had only one drawback, no fish, as my husband is a quasi-vegetarian, i.e. eats fish. Focusing on the hotel, it was exceptionally pleasant. Breakfast was served on the rooftop and was a sumptuous spread, the usual tomatoes and cucumbers but with 3 or 4 cheeses to choose from. They also served scrambled eggs, \"hot dogs\" and biscuit, potatoes, a fruit salad, fresh strawberries, watermelon, and several types of jam. There was bread for toast, as well as sweet breads. At night, the rooftop offered (for a fee) drinks (alcohol) and/or tea and coffee, again with classical music. You could see the Blue Mosque from one side of the rooftop. On the other side was the sea. Our room was a reasonable size, we could move in it, open suitcases, and had a chair and desk. There was always plenty of hot water for showers. We also had what was called a semi-sea view room which was a better sea view than the room we had the first night. The first night only a sea view room was available. We were in room 403. A new hotel is going up next door, but I don't think it will block the sea view we had. The room had two windows which you could open. And for those who want to always stay connected, there is a free internet notebook in the lobby, and if you are carrying your laptop, easy wi-fi access from your room or rooftop. Overall a great hotel with a staff ever willing to answer questions, call a taxi, advise over restaurants. I really can't think of any thing I would want to complain about.

Initially we couldn't locate the hotel from the tram as you have to walk pass the Blue Mosque and down the hill, then a side street leading to Dersaadet. The walk from Sultanhamet tram line to the hotel is about 5 mins. The hotel looks exactly as the website so you can't miss it and we stayed in room 503 on the 3rd floor which overlooked the sea which was really nice although there were building works opposite the hotel so not sure if that block the view. The staff at the front desk were extremely friendly and helpful. The hotel had an internet for all the guest to use free of charge (located by the front desk). The standard double rooms are on a bit of a cozy size but it was clean although we had problems with water leaking through the base of the shower base but it was cleared up every day. The breakfast on the terrace was a pleasant surprise as there is a beautiful view of the Blue Mosque and the sea so we managed to sit outside for breakfast (unfortunately, we had wet weather during our stay so on our last day, we managed to take advantage of the outside terrace). If you're not used to the Muslim calls for prayer...the first call takes place at 5.30am and there is a tower just outside opposite our room! To note, we paid cash on check out and the hotel gave us 10% discount. Upon arrival before customs, you get your visa and beware you may expect a long queue. I would recommend taking public transport when you arrive from Istanbul International airport because it was so efficent and it cost 1.40 TL for each jeton (token). As mentioned in the travel tips on Istanbul, you'd need to buy 2 jetons to get to the historical area. You can purchase these when you board the Light Railway at the airport which is sign posted and downstairs from the arrival lounge. The Light Railway journey takes about 10 mins then you have to change to get on to the Tram and to get to Sultanhamet stop, it takes approx 25 mins. We managed to get a seat from start to finish. I wouldn't say Istanbul is cheap destination as on the first night, we were recommended by the hotel to eat at Almerida restaurant which turns out to be favoured by tourists as there were no locals eating there at all (which was quite funny!) and as for the price - it worked out around 40 TL per head without alcohol. After that experience we tried the local food as much as we could. The seafood was fantastic and fresh. If you aim towards the ferry pier which is about 15 mins walk from Sultanhamet then you would be able to find more seafood or cheaper restaurants along the way...just follow the tram line (downhill) to the last stop...you can't miss the ferry pier. If you're game, try the fish bread sandwich which is freshly grilled mackeral with lettuce and onions in a bagette - you can try this by the ferry pier where you see floating boats grilling the fish and the locals sitting and eating by it (costs 4 TL). The Spice market is by the ferry pier and great for getting your turkish delight (facing the front main entrance of the spice bazaar and on the right hand side you will see stalls selling fish, cheese, etc, walk up and you will see an entrance on the left hand side going into the bazaar, enter, and you will see a turkish delight stall on the corner which also sells tea) for 6 TL for half a kilo box - you can also sample before trying! Along Galata Bridge, you will see locals fishing and underneath the bridge there are a number of restaurants and cafes. To get to Taksim, we took the funicular (1.40 TL) up to the bottom of the bridge to the bottom of Taksim Square and walked up - the shops and cafes are similar to those you find in any big cities and prices to match e.g., a cake and coffee came to 10 TL. There are Starbucks and MacDonalds if you get bored of eating kebabs and fish. Unfortunately some of the mosques were undergoing renovation e.g., Hagia Sophia (20 TL entrance fee) and the mosques closed on Mondays. In fact, it's more spectacular at night when the mosques are lit up. Walk along the back route of the Spice Bazaar to the Grand Bazaar as you won't get hassled by the touristy shops in fact it was a really nice walk to mingle with the locals on their daily routine.", "Date": "April 28, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "lancashire", "Title": "\u201cexcellent position for main attractions in \"old city\", quite exceptional friendly staff and impartial advice.\u201d", "Author": "kerryLancashire", "ReviewID": "UR28797089", "Content": "we stayed in the sultan's suite. very spacious. some of other rooms are less big and may have only partial views of the sea of marmaris. check with desk staff before booking.

You can walk to a different restaurant every night. We liked Doy Doy and Tamara a block away for lunch. Walk to the end of the Arasta Bazaar and turn right, that is the area loaded with restaurants and night life. We enjoyed Turquoise and Kathisma in particular. You can walk to all of the major tourist sites, which are incredible, of course, otherwise take the modern, clean tram for 1.40 TL to where you want to go. The Bosphorus cruise was lovely, a good day trip on a warm, good weather day. The hotel itself is very quiet, but you will wake up with the call to prayer very early in the morning, just try to fall back asleep.

The deluxe corner suites were booked so we had a standard double and a triple on the 3rd floor. The cons: entire hotel was very hot and stuffy (cold outside); although technically a non-smoking hotel, the smell of cigarette smoke wafted through our vents; the bathroom was tiny and smelled of sewer gas; the shower was even tinier and the door fell off (I'm not tall and couldn't bend over; my husband said that he felt like he was trapped in a jar); TV didn't work (staff immediately replaced it with a different one that worked, but was equally old and small); dated furnishings (neither new nor quaint near-antique); thin walls so noise from hallway and neighbors; very loud construction noise right outside our window every night (not the hotel's fault, but do you really want to stay next to a construction site?). The pros: very nice staff -- we didn't ask for much, but I feel certain that we would have gotten it had we asked; good breakfasts; convenient location; WiFi connection in the rooms.

Why we booked: We booked this hotel having read many great review on Trip Advisor. The price of the room, 100 Euros / Night seemed reasonable to split among 3 people. As an added bonus the free pick-up from the airport was a nice touch. Airport Pick Up: The arrival into Istanbul was painless, the driver (very friendly, I might add) was waiting for us with a sign as we exited the customs entrance. A very pleasant welcome after a long flight. The ride to the hotel took all of 30 minutes. It's just a quick zip on a coastal highway. Hotel Location: Location is in the heart of the tourist district, Sultanhamete. The neighborhood is very residential and super super quiet. If you're looking to be in the heart of the action I do not recommend this location. Also the downside of this neighborhood is it's very geared towards tourists and everything is overpriced. Food isn't that great, shops are targeted to tourists, nightlife is a 30 minute ride on rail, or a 15 - 20 Lira Taxi ride. If it's tourist sight by day, and action by night, I DO NOT recommend this hotel. You're better off finding a hotel in Taksim Square area also know as Begoylu. Tons of bars, great restaurants, shopping, public transit, full of natives, and very vibrant. Hotel Room / Facilities : The room -- Yes, I'm American, and we are used to everything being big, but I've also traveled a lot and for three people staying in the room it was a bit cramped. The room itself and the bed were decent. Old-fashioned,traditional decor. Everything was spotlessly clean. Lets just call it very cozy. View was basically non-existent, tiny window looking down on to the street. Also, free wifi, always a plus! The rest -- The top floor breakfast area is really nice. Like all hotels in the area you have a view looking onto the sea, and the surroundings. Food was delicious for being a free breakfast. The waiter was very friendly and helpful in every way possible. Downside is it closes at 10:30 pm, so forgot going up for a smoke or having a little romantic private time. Staff is very helpful, courteous, what one should generally expect. They have a laptop on the bottom floor if you didn't bring your computer. Overall, it's about average for what you should expect from a hotel. Pluses: -Staff, cozy, close to the super touristy spots. Great if you're just spending a weekend. Quiet if you like quiet. Clean. Friendly. Minuses: Location, location, location. Taxis never are able to find the place. You're not in the heart of the action. Yes, you're close to the Blue Mosque and tourist spots but. If you're in Taksim Square, it's just a train ride over to tourist central for the day, and you're back in the action at night.", "Date": "January 23, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "USA", "Title": "\u201cWonderful hotel with excellent service\u201d", "Author": "ks122", "ReviewID": "UR23780712", "Content": "We just returned from a weekend in Istanbul and were extremely impressed with Dersaadet Hotel\u00c2\u00b4s levels of quality and service.

We have travelled a lot and stayed in quite a few hotels but it is our first time in Istanbul. Backpacing is not an option (says the wife)so most of the hotels have been 3-4 stars.The thing about hotels is,there are two ways they dissappoint. The first, when the service is poor, the place unsanitary and amenities and location are lousy. The second is when the the clients expectations are not matched The latter is not always the hotels fault. It can do the best job within its parameters but still not satisfy. The dersaadat falls in the second category. ITs not a bad hotel but tripadvisor raises the bar significantly in terms of expectations. Also it is my first time in turkey and this is the only hotel i stayed in so i dont know what the others are like. Please bear that in mind when reading this review. The hotel's plus points - Pick up from the airport was punctual and spot on, check in was quick and hassle free, staff was polite, courteous and friendly (service with a smile), breakfast (i am a HUGE breakfast man) was brilliant(meat, eggs, homemade jams, cereals etc) and the terrace breakfast venue is a delight.

We did bring it to the attention of the recepetion but not much was (or maybe could be) done. BUT the worst thing was the BED. Very uncomfortable. WE could feel our backs complain in the morning for the 5 days we were there. TV lacks any REAL channels for the non-turkish speaker( but again its istanbul!)

The inn is a restored 19th century Ottoman wooden house and has a beautiful decor and a cozy ambiance about it that makes it a welcome place to come back to after a day of sightseeing. The inn is about a 5 minute walk from the Blue Mosque but is also located on a quiet little side street unlike most of the hotels in Sultanahmet which are located in clustered tourist areas. There are a few restaurants and local markets with reasonable prices within blocks of the inn. We had only booked for two nights but ended up extending our stay two nights more because we were so happy with the accommodations. The first two nights we were in a sea view double and the second two nights we were in a standard double. The rooms are definitely on the small side, but in a cozy way, and also are very clean and have all the amenities one would need. The sea view is not worth the extra money so I would recommend just getting the standard double (though it is street level and much noisier). You can get plenty of the sea view at the free breakfast on the beautiful rooftop terrace. The aspect that puts the Dersaadet over the top is the service. The front desk was extremely helpful and kind under all circumstances including booking us at their sister hotel, Hotel Niles, for a fifth night (we tried to extend again but they were full) and transporting us there for free.

It's a delightfully aesthetic property and just what we were looking for in terms of local or ethnic Turkish flavor as we were a couple of 'been there, done that' weary travellers from New York city. The rooms are simple but tastefully done, we were especially taken up with the motifs that are hand painted on the ceiling of each room. The rooms to go for are the sea facing ones so one can catch beautiful views of the fascinating Sea of Marmara with it's steady stream of graceful ships and boats sailing across. The best feature of the hotel is their rooftop bar/restaurant with it's views of the Blue Mosque (you feel you can almost touch this marvellous edifice , it's so close to the hotel) and the sea all around. Breakfast is served in the mornings here and for the rest of the day guests can use it as a cafe to sit and gaze at the sea and dream, to sketch or read while all the while the most melodious classical music streams in from various European radio stations. We cannot say enough about the hospitality and friendliness of the hotel staff. They are so genuinely helpful and friendly and when they told us to view their hotel as their 'home' in Istanbul, it had a ring of authenticity to it. And finally, if you , like us are looking to be in the ancient and historic part of Istanbul, then this is the place to be as the hotel is located in the Sultanahmet area and you can literally stumble across to the Blue Mosque and all the wonderful historic sights of the city.

Since they have a fantastic roof terrace, I was unconcerned about not having a sea view the last 2 nights. The 3rd floor room was great. Small, but charming, and comfortable. It had a nice sea view. If we had spent the entire time in that room, I would rate the hotel as perfect. Breakfast on the roof terrace was very, very pleasant. Our last 2 nights were to be spent in the \"larger\" room on the ground floor without a sea view. It was, in fact, a dingy basement triple room, with 2 high windows that would open to the front street. The room smelled awful and moldy. There was black mildew around the a/c vent and on the adjacent ceiling. There had been a big rain the day before...so, I don't know if this was a factor. I couldn't find wet carpet or wall board, but it smelled like wet carpet that had not dried properly. We opened the windows and aired it out. It helped us breath, but the street noise (you were watching people's feet walking 2 feet away & cars going by) was deafening. We could not carry on a conversation with the windows open, let alone sleep. Management told us it was the only room in the house, which I believe. We did spend a couple of hours airing out the room, hoping it would help. Unfortunately, when we closed the windows the moldy stench was overwhelming.

It is located in the touristic area of Istanbul (Sultanhamet), behind the Blue Mosque (which you can admire from the terrace of the hotel) and very near to all major turistic attractions of Istanbul (Topkapy Palace, Aya Sofia, the Basilica Cisterns, the Arasta Bazar, etc.). The building is a typical ottoman style building, very well maintained and carachteristic. The neighborhoods are not particularly exciting (a laundry, some undefined shops, bakery, etc) but they are safe and sufficiently quiet.

In general we would say that the Hotel is very worth to go, and you can with no doubts rank it among the 4 stars hotel. Of course, if you seek for the best, it would not satisfy you, but if you are looking for a price/quality balanced structure (190 Euro per night, the Suite) you may not be disappointed.

The location of the hotel was excellent and made it easy to see a sites and make a quick stop at the hotel to recharge and then head back out. It was a 5 minute walk to the Blue Mosque and St. Sohphia Church and the main street for shopping and snacking, and 15 minute walk to the Grand Bazaar. We paid $109 euros a night for the hotel, which included the 5 percent discount for paying in cash. We paid in Turkish lira so the hotel calculated the exchange rate between euros and lira. The exchange rate was off by a few percent from the published daily rate, but it wasn't too bad. The hotel picked us up and dropped us off from the airport.

I agree entirely with everything written by samsacremento in a recent review (26 May 2008) - it's a really accurate report, in my opinion, and it doesn't raise unreasonable expectations. We were very happy with this hotel - the location, the staff, the cleanliness and comfort of our room (the Sultan's Penthouse Suite) and the breakfast were all excellent; if we ever return to Istanbul, then we would not hesitate to stay here again. The proximity of the Dersaadet to many of the main sights is a major plus. I don't think I have ever seen anything more beautiful than the view from the hotel's roof terrace of the Blue Mosque lit up at night with the seagulls flying above it, all shining white in the lights. The public transport system in Istanbul is great and cheap - we used the Tramway to reach Eminonu and when we went across to Beyoglu. It's 1.4 Turkish Lira per journey. The ferry system is also just as cheap and it's a great way to see Istanbul from a different perspective. There are plenty of restaurants and bars near the hotel. We tried The Pudding Shop on Divan Yolu on the first evening. That was pretty OK but not spectacular. We also ate at the Cafe Mesale - a tea garden/water pipe restaurant (outdoors - NB no alcohol) and that was excellent. There's a short whirling dervish performance at 8pm and 10 pm each day and we liked the overall atmosphere as well as the meze. We the world's most expensive (well, maybe!!) lattes in the Topkapi Palace! Of the bars/restaurants on the main drag in Sultanahmet (Divan Yolu) we liked the Cozy Pub the best - had an excellent steak for 24 Turkish Lira. The drinks are not cheap but there was a good vibe about the place. One thing we did (in easy walking distance of the Dersaadet was the cookery class with Eveline (cooking Alaturka) - brilliant!

There were 2 couples and we all enjoyed this small, friendly, family run hotel. It's located in the old city in a residential area. That was the best part. We enjoyed \"living\" among our neighbors. Yes, there is a manual car wash business across the street, but all you hear is the sound of water coming from one pressure washer and the voices of the 1 or 2 people working there. There's also the neighborhood produce man who wheels his cart through the narrow streets each day, the bread man who comes by calling out with a huge round tray of fresh bread on his head. Each day a man comes by crying out to buy scrap iron which he loads into his wheelbarrow. The potato truck drives by now and then. Women hang their laundry on their rooftop terraces to dry. One woman lowered her money in a bucket on a rope from her 3rd story window to pay for some fresh goods a peddler put into the bucket for her to haul up. Kids play soccer outside their homes in the narrow street. The nearby mosque calls the faithful to prayer. I loved it, even at 5 in the morning. Other than that, the neighborhood is quiet at night except for an occasional dog barking. The location is perfect for seeing the major attractions in Istanbul. This is the area the tour buses haul everyone to from somewhere else, but we got to live here instead and simply walk to the Blue Mosque, Hagia Sophia, Basilica Cistern, the Grand Bazaar, the Hop On/Hop Off city tour bus, the Topeki Palace, many and varied restaurants, the Archeological Museum, and more. The only time we needed transportation was to catch the ferry to tour the Bosphorous (and actually we could have walked -- it would just have taken 30 minutes). So the location is perfect. Besides that, so is the hotel. It has about 17 rooms on 3 floors with the lobby below and the rooftop terrace above. We sprang for one of the two corner suites and it was worth it. It was huge with one double bed and across the room a single bed, in the middle were 2 comfy overstuffed chairs with a little coffee table and reading lamp, a big roomy dresser and an ample wardrobe for hanging clothes. The bathroom could have used some shelf space but otherwise is large and included a jacuzzi tub with shower. Shower cap, shower gel, soap, shampoo, conditioner, lotion and a hair dryer are provided. The room has five windows -- the better to stick our heads out for watching neighborhood life, gazing at the sea, and getting plenty of light. Nicely decorated in rich, warm colors and a Turkish rug. The room has 2 heat/ac units which worked just fine. The lobby is comfy with a sofa, bookshelves with LOTS of guide books you can borrow, and several small round tables/chairs. We four played bridge there several times in the evening. Also a lap top computer is set up on one for patrons to use with no charge. It works fast and without problems. There is free Wi-Fi in the rooms (our laptop worked great -- no problems using it the whole week). The entire hotel is spotlessly clean and nicely furnished and decorated. The front desk is manned 24/7 with the most helpful, friendly people possible. They can recommend places to see and eat and will arrange reservations, transportation, etc. When returning one night from a wonderful dinner at a newly opened restaurant recommended by the young man at the front desk, we told him the otherwise great meal was spoiled by cigarette smokers surrounding us. We found out the next day he had spoken with the owner and given him our complaint and they were working on a smoke free space upstairs! By the way, we were told that within a month or so new city ordinances will be in effect requiring all public areas to provide separate smoking and non-smoking areas. That will be a big help as there is a LOT of smoking in Istanbul -- everywhere. We had absolutely no problems walking around at night. Never the slightest concern about our safety. There are lots of tourists wandering around by the nearby attractions and near our hotel there are many neighbors out and about. The hotel has a small, efficient elevator. It's true as others have written, that the electricity may fail (it did only once that we were aware of in our 7 night stay and that was for less than 30 minutes). The elevator will not take you to the terrace level. It goes only to the 3 floors of rooms, then you must walk one short, circular flight to the rooftop. Breakfast is served here until 10:30 so no need to get up early. There are several round inside tables and smaller, wrought iron outside tables with floor to ceiling glass/sliding door for an unspoiled view of the sea and the Blue Mosque. The food was very good. Scrambled eggs were especially good. Cheese or meat wrapped in baked/fried pastry, dry cereals, many different breads/muffins, cheeses, butter, cream cheese, creamed chocolate spread, hard-cooked eggs, thick yogurt, lots of jams, milk, cherry and orange juice, American style coffee that was delicious. One of us did wish there had been oatmeal (instant would be fine if a microwave could be provided) and skim milk since he's working on a low fat diet. We ate 7 breakfasts and I never tired of them. There is always someone there to help/serve. After breakfast, the terrace is open until late at night. Very light snacks (2 types of sandwich) are served as well as mixed drinks, several beers, and wine. Just across the narrow, hilly street from the hotel are 2 mini markets where we got snacks and even decent red wine for about $12 a bottle. In both of the markets, the clerks were willing to open the bottle for us and even provided plastic cups without charge. There a tiny laundry next door where you can drop off your clothes and pick them up washed and dried that night or the next day. About $7 for 2 pounds. They'll even iron for an additional charge. There is even a turkish bath down the street (but we didn't try it). One of the best services the hotel offers is free pickup at the airport if you are staying 3 or more nights. It was such a gift to find our names on a placard being held by a very friendly man as we walked into the terminal. He introduced us to another friendly man who managed to fit us 4 and our 12 pieces of luggage into his new, clean, big \"people mover.\" Although this same free service isn't offered when you leave, the hotel will arrange it for less than $30 total (not per person)! Well worth it. Another nice service: because we paid cash (some in US dollars, some in Turkish lire, and some in Euros) our bill was discounted 5%. Remembering some of the complaints other reviewers had: I have fibromyalgia and have a very difficult time finding a comfortable bed away from home. I had no problem with the hotel bed; I didn't even ask for the extra topper. The bed was firm but felt good. The car wash is virtually a one man operation and not a repair shop in any way; it's not a problem. The free computer works fine; no problems at all. If you can walk for 10 minutes, there are plenty of restaurants around serving all different kinds of food. Yes there are a lot with only traditional Turkish and that does get old after awhile, but we found Indian, fish, continental, Italian, and even Mexican as well, all within easy walking distance. I agree: be sure to see the Basilica Cistern (it's huge, underground, amazing -- they even sometimes have concerts there). Also definitely take a cruise up the Bosphorous. Don't take a tourist ferry. Take the regular commuter ferry. It will zig zag from the European to the Asian side, stopping at several fishing villages. At the end (where the ferry will have a 2 or 3 hour wait before returning), get off and eat a nice leisurely lunch in the village, then cruise back to Istanbul. Pretty sights along the way. The Hop On/Hop Off bus is expensive but we enjoyed the tour. Saw the modern side of Istanbul and so glad we stayed in the old city. But also saw many other sights we'd miss otherwise (e.g., the metal church brought from Norway (?), miles of the original city fortress walls). The Grand Bazaar is nothing special, really -- just huge and claustrophobic. Much more fun and exotic was the Spice Bazaar which we saw right before we boarded the ferry for the cruise up the Bosphorous (they are just across the street from each other).", "Date": "May 26, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Surrey England", "Title": "\u201cReally enjoyed the Dersaadet Hotel Istanbul\u201d", "Author": "Manapools", "ReviewID": "UR16189435", "Content": "We spent four nights in the Dersaadet Hotel in Istanbul.

It is centrally located in the Old Town district of Istanbul, and convienient to the major sites and restaurants (but take note of landmarks if you leave on foot--it's hard to find! Our cabdriver had to ask literally about 10 people, and we had the address written on a piece of paper for him! We also got lost the first time we tried to find it again on foot). The staff (main desk and assistants) was excellent, and the (included) breakfast was quite tasty and diverse. The rooftop restaurant setting has a great view of either the Blue Mosque, and the sea of Marmara. Drawbacks: the room was supposed to be ready at 1, and it wasn't ready until 2:30, which lost us major time waiting around and caused us to miss much of what we wanted to see at Topkapi Palace, since they closed at 5 (guidebooks had said 7). There are no washcloths provided, just towels--staff said they don't have washcloths. There was a slight water leak from the minibar fridge on the floor, and there seemed to be a bit of mold in the tub. It was a small room, but the decor was interesting, and beds comfortable enough (our room had a double and a twin bed). Not luxury, but for location and a short stay, a good place if you're prepared for a few things not being the best. The front desk manager also arranged for airport transport when we asked about it the day before we left; the car service he called was a good one, and right on time. ALso, the room we had was a bit noisy for a while, as the hotel is across the street from a carwash that had a LOUD sprayer. There is a laptop in the lobby with free internet (but the Turkish-character keyboard was not configured the way ours is...for example, where the period would be, we got the \"slash\" character!) There are also local guidebooks that one can borrow, in the lobby. The toilet was somewhat flimsy in the seat and lid. But overall, it was fine for a short stay, and seemed clean. Helpful hint: There is a small grocery store right across the street for bottled water or other needs, and the man was kind (when he didn't have change for our $20 Turkish lira bill, he offered the 2 waters for free and said \"You pay tomorrow\"--we were leaving then, so we gave him $1 American.", "Date": "May 11, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "California", "Title": "\u201cHighly recommended\u201d", "Author": "bonb88", "ReviewID": "UR15734761", "Content": "Stayed 5 nights at Dersaadet in Sultanahmet and 3 nights at the Orient Express (metro stop is G\u00c3\u00bclhane), so I will do a comparison of the two. They are about 10 Euros difference in price and both offer cash discounts: LOCATION: ORIENT EXPRESS (because I personally don't like the touristy aspect of Sultanahmet) Sultanahmet is where all the main attractions are, Aya Sofya, Sultanahmet Camii, Kapal\u00c4\u00b1 \u00c3\u00a7ar\u00c5\u0178\u00c4\u00b1 (Grand Bazaar), etc. so it's great for all that. The thing I don't like is that Sultanahmet is incredibly touristy, so someone will try to sell you something every 2 minutes walking in that area. There's a bunch of restaurants by the metro station. Within a few short blocks of the hotel there are some decent restaurants too, so you don't have to always walk over to the main drag. Orient Express is one metro stop away from Sultanahmet. It's literally right on the metro path (you walk out of the hotel a few steps and you could get hit by the metro). That street has restaurants and usual shops, but they don't grab you as much as they do in Sultanahmet. In fact, rarely. Being on the metro path and a busy street, you will hear some street noise but it wasn't too bad at all. ROOM / HOTEL: ORIENT EXPRESS (edged out slightly due to room size) Dersaadet is an independent, small hotel. The rooms are smaller and older, but very clean and absolutely adequate. Bed is comfortable and bathroom is very clean. There is free internet at the lobby, and there is a laundry shop a few doors down. There's a restaurant at the rooftop but we only had breakfast there. Orient Express is part of a hotel group, so it has more of a standard hotel feel. The room is more standard Hilton'ish, decent size and there's more room for luggage and stuff. Bed is also comfortable and bathroom is also very clean. There is also free internet and printer by the lobby, but the printer was broken at the time. There's a rooftop restaurant and a cafe/bar downstairs. They have laundry service but I imagine it'd be on par with the price at a regular hotel, which is expensive. They serve welcome Elma \u00c3\u2021ay (fake apple tea) and zimit when we checked in. Both hotels offer free airport pickup if you stay a certain number of nights. To go to istanbul airport, you actually could take the metro if you don't have too much luggage and it'll save you money (about 2.6 YTL vs. 25 Euros). Just remember that during busy hours the metro cars get crowded and it may not be comfortable for a few stops, but it was fine for us. STAFF: DERSAADET All the front desk staff at Dersaadet is awesome - incredibly polite, friendly, and helpful, and I'd say more personable than OE. We mostly talked to Umit and he's just great. Really friendly and try to help with everything. More people work at OE, and the staff we met were also very polite and helpful, but just slightly more \"standard\" overall. When they were recommending things to do, it was more to the tune of generic packaged tours. If you ask about other specific things, they may not know. There's really nothing I can fault the staff at OE, but Dersaadet's smaller, more close-knit staff gives a more personal feeling to our stay. BREAKFAST: Sort of tied. Both have good selection of cereal, cold cuts, breads, dried fruits, etc. OE has a larger selection that includes sausages and scrambled eggs, different cheeses, etc. But really, how much can you eat at breakfast?

Pity that there are not many places to eat in the neighbourhood, but the European side where restaurants concentrate is just a tram-ride away, and Istanbul is a pleasant place to have a quiet stroll back in the evening from the Sultanhamet tram station.

Our rooms were simple and clean with gorgeous views of the nearby mosque and the sea. The elevator made our climb to our 5th floor room effortless.

The Blue Mosque, the Hippodrome, the Basilica Cistern and Hagia Sophia are all less than twenty minutes walk away.

It was a wonderful experience. Every aspect of this small, charming hotel was simply outstanding. The hotel arranged an air-conditioned car to meet me at the airport, a great help after a long flight to an unknown city where I didn't know the language. This was a nice beginning. My very comfortable and attractive room, enhanced by traditional, hand-painted designs on the ceiling, had a lovely view to the sea, a wonderful sight at any time of day or evening. (While I was completely satisfied with the room, I also learned that the staff will try to accommodate a guest's special wishes, too.) The bathroom was very pleasant, tiled in charming, color-coordinated tiles. Both the room and the bathroom were kept spotlessly clean, fresh and well-supplied by housekeeping. The hotel's roof terrace is a marvelous feature which I enjoyed every morning and many evenings. The very good and varied buffet breakfast is served there, as well as drinks at other times of day. At breakfast, I loved the fresh melon and watermelon, dried apricots and raisins, cereals, cheese, sliced meats, homemade baked goods and their (optional) wonderful Turkish coffee. It was a great way to begin the day, to chat with other guests and the staff, and to simply soak up the view, sea breeze and Mediterranean environment. I really loved the wonderful view from this terrace toward the Blue Mosque and over the rooftops to the sea. Sitting there in the evening having some light refreshments, with the lighted mosque on one side and the lights of the Bosphorus on another side, and sometimes the moon rising over the water, was one of my favorite ways to relax at the end of the day. Last but definitely not least, I was impressed by the warm, friendly atmosphere and the amazing level of service provided by everyone I encountered on the staff. They really shine in this area, making me feel at home and among friends. The staff were always available to help, for example, assisting guests if requested in making plans for the day, suggesting interesting places to visit or to dine, helping to understand local customs, finding boat schedules, calling taxis and making dinner reservations, even offering to locate a doctor for a guest in need and then offering to get the prescriptions filled at the pharmacy -- and much more. All is done in a relaxed, courteous, competent and friendly manner. I can't say enough about how much I enjoyed my stay and would highly recommend it without reservation to anyone who wants a charming, well-located, lovely and friendly hotel in Istanbul.", "Date": "November 5, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Laguna Niguel, CA", "Title": "\u201cGreat stay!\u201d", "Author": "MandiZm", "ReviewID": "UR10436762", "Content": "I have to agree with all of the other reviews.

We alyways look for small, \"boutique-like\" hotels when travelling. I can only reiterate this website's reviews of the Dersaadet. One notice though; the Dersaadet is not a hotel for people looking for a 7-star accomodation and designer luxury. It is a simple, tastefully decorated and highly attractive ottoman building, ideal for travellers who appreciate local flavours and a personal touch. After a few months of procrastination, I finally post this review of our hotel stay of march 9th to the 13th. My husband and I stayed 4 nights, had a very small but very comfy room on the 1st floor (one above the ground level). As we booked over the Internet and paid cash, we paid only 63\u00e2\u201a\u00ac/night for a double room with breakfast. And free wi-fi internet was also a feature that made us choose the Dersaadet. It worked perfectly especially from the rooftop bar. A definite plus. There was no carpet in our room (which is my criteria # 1 in choosing hotels - criteria # 2 beeing wi-fi internet). It had a very modern but also very small bathroom, good water pressure, clean towels and bedsheets, rather smallish but very good mattresses, very friendly reception services (in English and also a bit of German). There is a lift in the hotel too. The breakfast/lunch roof-terrace/bar is absolutely lovely and even offers a partial view of the Blue Mosque and the water. Right in the middle of Sultanahmet, it is conveniently located to many touristic attractions (Ayasofia, Blue Mosque, Topkapi Palace, Grand and Spice Bazaars, Basilica Cistern, etc). It's also easily accessible from the Atat\u00c3\u00bcrk Airport. If you are willing to get your feet moving, you can reach so many attractions by foot from the hotel without a problem. Sultanahmet is a \"real\" neighborhood so the houses around are not out of a Disney attraction park, you see how some people really live and work in today's Istanbul. Definitely worth a visit is the Taksim quarter of Istanbul, situated on the other of the city. That's where \"real\" life in today's Istanbul is happening. Cool, metropolitan and extremely european in it's feel. Another big plus; as we had stayed 4 nights, we also had a free airport pick-up included in the price which was really appreciated. We flew with Turkish Airlines from Berlin to Istanbul and I must admit, and my husband and I travel quite a lot, that it was the most relaxed flight we had in a long time. There are lots of restaurants in the aera; charcoaled lamb meat is definitely a delicious turkish specialty, so is pomegranate juice and their strong turkish coffee :-) On our last day at the hotel, I asked the assistant manager to show us the suite situated at the corner of the hotel. The right room for more luxury, comfort and space. One thing really stuck me in Istanbul; the amount of cats !! A local told us that the authorities tolerate their massive presence as they keep the mice and rat population under control. I found this to be an interesting touch. And the colors and smells of the markets... Quite unique.

(Although we had flown overnight from New Mexico, we were eager to leave our belongings and begin exploring Istanbul right away. Since it was so hot, we went to the Cistern first, which was much cooler than the temperature on the streets and was an incredible place to behold.) This was our first adventure off the North American continent, so we were a bit surprised at the size of the room and adjoining bath, which were small by American standards. (I don't know why those of us from the US got the goofy idea that everything should super-sized, but we unfortunately have, and we need to get over it!) The room and bath were immaculately clean, and the furnishings were charming, with a beautifully decorated ceiling. The photos on the web site depict a really accurate picture, by the way, so if you really want to see what they look like, check that out. Our bed was two twins pushed together, with a nightstand and lamp on each side and a wardrobe for clothes storage. We were there to board a Wind Star cruise five days later, so we didn't unpack completly and instead stowed hanging clothes, but left the bulk of other items in our suitcases. There was no safe in the room, but we locked valuables a carry-on and had no trouble. You can check things at the front desk as well. Early each morning, the call to prayer could be heard from the speakers on minarets near the hotel, and that was totally magical. There is a rooftop terrace and breakfast room with a view of the Blue Mosque where a mini feast is served each morning. It included sliced meats, cheeses, and hard-boiled eggs and yogurt for us protein lovers, plus there were perfectly ripened tomatoes, cucumbers, melons, and other fruits including dates and figs. There were a couple kinds of cerelas and severals kinds of breads and pastries, as well as orange juice, which I believe was fresh-squeezed. The coffee was out of this world, as was the apple tea, which is served EVERYWHERE in Istanbul. The terrace was also open in the evenings; it was soothing way to end each day and begin each evening. We'd go up to the terrace and join other hotel guests to exchange stories of the day and drink a glass (or two!) of raki. In Turkey, raki is the unofficial 'national drink' and it is traditionally drunk mixed with water; the dilution causes this alcoholic beverage to turn a milky-white color, and possibly because of its color, this mixture is popularly called aslan s\u00c3\u00bct\u00c3\u00bc or arslan s\u00c3\u00bct\u00c3\u00bc, both literally meaning \"lion's milk\" (aslan and arslan also mean strong, brave man, hence milk for the brave men). Very tasty and highly recommended! The hotel has a small elevator, but the stairs were actually a real treat as they were beautiful wood and went around and around. Given the fabulous food that is available througout the neighborhood right near the hotel, taking the stairs was one way to avoid piling on the pounds during our trip. The location of this property is ideal for those who wish to explore the major sites of Istanbul. We walked everywhere and felt totally safe day or night. I have heard from friends that Istanbul gives less of that feeling for women traveling alone, but we are a married couple and every single person we met throughout our five-day stay was lovely, save for one rug salesman who became beligerant when we declined to purchase a rug from him (we did buy four others from other vendors). Please remember to be respectful of local customs and beliefs: (1) For women, head, shoulders and knees are to be covered whenever entering a mosque. We saw an American (very embarrassing for us) woman who showed up at the Blue Mosque wearing a tube top and short shorts! One of the attendants outside the door quickly handed her several items to wrap around herself, averting his eyes the entire time. I found it very easy to roll up a skirt and a pashmina (both for sale everywherein the city) into day pack and then put them when needed. The expressions of thanks for my showing this simple courtesy were overwhelming. (2) Enthusiastic (some might say pushy) vendors trying to get people into their shops or restaurants is 'done' in Istanbul. While it may seem a bit over the top at times, generally if you simply enter the shop, have the apple tea and peruse the merchandise, most people don't care if you actually buy - they just want you to LOOK. If you're on limited time, however, you obviously can't enter every shop and look around. Say \"no thank you\" and move along. (3) The Grand Bazaar is one shop after another (over 4,000 of them) of the same kinds of things again and again. We found the Egyptian Spice Market to be a much more enjoyable and enchating place to shop. Many of the vendors have vacuum-sealing machines, so we were able to bring home olives and other \"fresh\" items. (4) The Eyewitness Guide to Istanbul was perfect for identifying all the fabulous places to see - allow a full day, if you have it, for Tokapi Palace and take the extra tour of the harem-it's fascinating. Also, the restaurant that overlooks the sea serves a wonderful lunch.

I booked this boutique hotel based on the numerous positive reviews I have read here at Trip Advisor. I am happy to say that we had a wonderful stay! We had 2 triple rooms, one on the second floor and one on the third. We both had windows facing the sometimes mentioned \"garage\". It is only a car wash and we did hear it at times but it was not a bother. The windows were fairly well insulated so they buffered the carwash and the numerous \"call to prayer\" that occur throughout the day. The rooms were clean and simply furnished. My only negative about the room was that the beds were pretty hard. I had read from past reviews about getting a bed pad but we didn't bother with that. After walking around all day we were so tired that it didn't take much for us to drop off to sleep. The bathrooms were nice size, not large but not too small. We had plenty of hot water and water pressure. The hotel did lose power the morning of our last day but the staff worked like crazy to get it back on as quickly as possible. The one feature of this hotel that really served us well was the large sitting area next to reception. There were several tables, chairs, and a nice sofa. We spent many evenings there playing scrabble, using the hotel laptop and free internet, and just chatting with fellow guests. It gives you a comfortable place to relax outside your room. I am not a breakfast eater but the rest of my family thoroughly enjoyed the breakfast buffet that is included in the room rate. The location is very convenient to all the sights in Sultanahmet. We did not take a taxi once. We did take the hop on, hop off bus to see all the areas of Istanbul but if you want convenience in the older, historical area you will be happy with this hotel. The very best thing about this hotel is the staff. I know it is mentioned over and over again in the various reviews but the compliments are well deserved. We were greeted very warmly upon arrival, treated like family all week, and given a fond farewell when we left.

We felt that we were met in a very genuine and helpful way by all the staff during our stay. We were warmly greeted, offered refreshments despite the breakfast room not opening for a couple of hours, and invited to wait around 20 minutes until our room was checked by 'housekeeping', who had not yet arrived. Our room was simple but lovely. We went up to breakfast and the service and selection surpassed expectations, as did the view of old Istanbul, the Blue Mosque and the Bosphorous. I mentioned my gluten intolerance which they had not come across. I was happy to eat what was on offer without gluten but the next day was offered my own gluten free loaf which the assistant manager had researched on the net and sourced for me especially! Impressive! Whatever our needs were at any time of the day we were well looked after. My birthday was recognised by all the staff and I felt very special! . My son was taught backgammon one afternoon by Cemil in the restaurant and both children were given local gifts as we left by the staff who were there to bid us farewell.

I have simply never stayed anywhere where the staff go out of their way quite so much to be pleasant and helpful. The view from the roof terrace was fantastic, with not just a great view of the Blue Mosque but also of the Sea of Marmara. We tended to return there in the evening for a post-prandial drink, as not only did you get the great view and the friendly staff, but the prices were cheaper than the local bars as well!

Staying for four nights meant we got a complimentary pick up from the airport, which made the whole business of arriving in a strange city much more pleasant. One tip I would give is that you are given a discount for paying in cash. The price is in Euros, but they will also accept other currencies \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I paid in British Pounds. The hotel looks up the exchange rate on the internet as you check out, and shows it to you - so all above board. The best bit is that the exchange rate the hotel gives you is the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcproper\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 bank rate, rather than a tourist rate, so it was a full 10% better than if I had changed my Pounds into Euros at the airport. Since the rooms have a safe, taking the cash with you should not be a problem. We were also impressed with how friendly and safe a place Istanbul as a whole was. The history of the place was fascinating, and there is a lot to see.

We prefered this location based on your review. And for us, a 38 years couple, was a very good choice. In three words Dersaadet is professional, warm and delicate. Professional and warm because of all staff, e-mail responses (from 10 minutes to one hour), prompt response at requests, room freshness and an excellent quality of the sleep. The size of the room (not so big) is understandable (the hotel is located in an old building from the oldest part of the city). But the real challenge for the owners was to transform this location in a ottoman style comfortable hotel. And they did it very well, paying attention to every detail and creating a so delicate hotel. The view from the second floor rooms, with Marmara sea view, is a good investiment. If you feel that you need more space, just go on the terrace (after 8.00-10.30 am breakfast is working as bar with a breathtaking view) or in the reception lobby. Or just go outside on the streets discovering the unique combination between the new and old buildings. The location is perfect for a deep understanding of the history and the spirit of Istanbul. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t forget to take some sea travels: on Golden Horn, Marmara Sea, and Bosphorus Cruise (starting from Eminonu \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 3 tramway station from Sultanahmet station: only one cruise in the winter time with 10:35 am departure and arrival at 12.05 in Anadolu Kavagi \u00e2\u20ac\u201c close to the Black Sea \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 30 min climbing a hill walk through the Genovese old fortress \u00e2\u20ac\u201c amazing view; departure time at 15:00 from Anadolu Kavagi and arrival time 16:30 Eminonu). And a cruise to the Prince\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Island (you can see two of the islands from the room window if you stay in a sea view room). The streets, the people, the ceramics and Iznik tiles, the Anatolian carpets and kilims, the caligraphy, the Byzantium churches and the Ottoman mosques, the museums and above all, the astonishing panorama views from different points will remain in our memory for a long time.

Location. The hotel is located within walking distance of the major sites (Blue Mosque, Ayasofia, Cistern, Grand Bazaar). It also is within walking distance of the tram -- which provides transit to the Egyptian Spice Market, the Galata Bridge, the Tunel funicular, and the ferry terminals. We took a taxi only once during our week-long stay (on the first day, before we got our bearings). 2. Hospitality. The hotel staff is unfailingly cordial and helpful. They provided airport transportation, made restaurant reservations, mapped out directions, and answered questions about the city. 3. The Breakfast and Terrace. Istanbul is a city chock full of terraces, and we dined and drank at several rooftop restaurants during our stay, but we never failed to be wooed by the view from the Dersaadet. We found it even more inspiring than the view from the Four Seasons. The included breakfast is delicious and filling, and it is quite an experience to sit on the terrace at dusk and hear the call to prayer ring out across the city. 4. The Rooms. We stayed for eight nights. Our first seven nights were spent in the Sultan's Suite. Though this room is pricey, you may find it a worthwhile indulgence. The room is huge, with a beautiful sitting area, many windows over looking the Marmara Sea, great breezes, and plenty of space to store clothing. It also is relatively quiet. On our last night, the suite was booked by another couple, so we had to stay in a standard double room. Even having experienced a more luxurious room, it's hard to complain about the smaller, and significantly less expensive, standard room: it was well-decorated and clean, though it had less spectacular views and more street noise than our former digs. 5. Free internet access. We did not bring a computer (if you do, there is free wireless access), but we took advantage of the laptop in the lobby, which has complimentary internet access. It's a bit creaky, but it did the trick. All in all, a great experience.

The spread was quite elaborate and quite delicious, from the feta and olives to the cherry juice and coffee, and kept us going till dinner.

For character it is unsurpassed. I don't like decor which hits you in the face but instead has an understated elegance to it. This one has it. Its detail is so complete that the wood grain found in the lobby is the same type and color found on the closet in your room! I even took a picture of the elevator as I thought it was beautiful! I cant compare room size with others in the area and, like most non-US hotels, expect it to be smaller. But it certainly was comfortable and not at all cramped. Breakfast on the roof consisted of homemade bread (fantastic), olives, granola and many other items i cant recall. But the best qualities of the hotel is the friendliness and helpfulness of the staff. They all get an A+ from me. For example, when I told the desk person that I was planning to go to the Blue Mosque and Hagia Sophia they asked me to come to them before I go for an orientation. Mind you this was not to recommend that I buy a tour from one of their friends or to go buy a carpet, etc. It was to tell me how much time I should expect to spend at each place, best way of getting there (a 5 minute walk), what to be on guard about, etc. It was a special service which I found very refreshing. Their extreme level of helpfulness, however, was reserved for another needed time. The most valuable service a hotel staff can provide for you is security, if and when it is needed. Luckily there arent many times (if ever) that you may need to call on their familiarity with the culture, or knowledge about certain situations to assist you. Unfortunately, however, I was a victim of a scam and turned to the hotel management and staff for their help. It required them to confront the criminal and to also contact, and get involved with, the police. They could not possiby have done a more professional job in defusing the situation and giving me a sense of security, well-being, and empathy. They were flawless in making me feel as comfortable as possible, and in defusing an escalating situation by making it clear to the criminal that he was not going to get what he wanted. There are other hotel staffs which I'm sure would have done the same. The problem, however, is that you don't know how a staff will react until there is already a situation.

We asked the hotel to arrange for a pickup at the airport: they were there to greet us upon arrival. If you book directly through the hotel and stay for three or more nights, this service is complimentary. We were also greeted at the door of the hotel, and our luggage was taken immediately to our room, which was on the entry-level. We did not find the noise to be a problem -- thanks to TripAdvisor, we knew to take earplugs; we did not have what might be termed \"a view,\" but I am sure we could have had we paid more. Our room was a bit on the small side, but it was absolutely spotless. We had specified non-smoking ... and we were a bit distressed at first to find an ash tray in the room; however, we did not note any tobacco smell. Our room had cable TV, free wifi access (there is also a computer with internet access in the lobby for guest use: it is my understanding that wifi extends to most, but not always all, rooms), in-room safe, and a pair of the cutest slippers --with the Dersaadet logo-- for each of us.

However, with the exception of the homebaked pastries, the fare did become a little repetitive after a few mornings. Please note, I am NOT suggesting a rich (and western) breakfast of eggs and bacon -- just a little more variety in what is served. I also was not a big fan of the \"juice,\" which was really not much more than Koolade: fresh squeezed orange juice was available for an additional 2 Euros. The hotel's location is ideal -- an easy walk to the Blue Mosque, Hagia Sophia, and the Arasta Bazaar (which in our opinion was far, far nicer than the Grand Bazaar); it is also only about seven blocks to the tram. There are several small restaurants quite close by, and we loved take out from Doy Doy. For wonderful fish try Balikci Sabahattin -- again, only a few blocks away. All in all, the Dersaadet offers good value and is an excellent choice for those who want to experience a bit of the \"old\" Istanbul --although don't get so caught up in the wonders of Sultanahmet that you don't cross the bridge and see the modern city-- while having the advantages of a well-run hotel with modern conveniences and an excellent (English speaking) staff.", "Date": "January 15, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "La Crosse, Wisconsin, USA", "Title": "\u201cI chose the Dersaadat after much research...\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4233208", "Content": "It was our first visit to Istanbul.

We were offered a free breakfast buffet every morning on the rooftop of the hotel that offered wonderful views of the city. The rooftop had both indoor and outdoor seating. Also, this hotel is located in the Sultanahmet district and is in great proximity to all of the major tourist attractions.

The service at this hotel was impeccable. I have stayed at 4 and 5 star hotels in the past; the service of the staff from the Dersaadat was far better than from those 4 and 5 star name brand hotels. Not only is the service great, the location of this hotel is outstanding. It is walking distance from all the major sites and is close enough to the city so that if you need to take a cab, your not spending more than 5 or 10 lira. We walked to all the historical sites, took a cruise accross the bosphorus, went by cab to some of the modern day sites and malls, and ended each day with an \"at home feelign\" at the dersadaat. ***HIGHLY RECOMMENDED*** Say \"hi!\" to Omit and Sunay if you go there!

What with fighting cats, barking dogs and calls to prayer starting at 5.50am, sleeping wasn't always easy, even with the windows tightly closed. If you want to buy rugs, would recommend looking around the many stores in Sultanahmet (the area local to the hotel) before braving the Grand Bazaar. We got some great deals (be prepared for a long-winded buying experience) and made a very special new friend with one of the rug traders. The Sultanahmet traders told us the Grand Bazaar was over-priced and the integrity of the traders there varied enormously. We believed them and had those beliefs confirmed when we did get to the Bazaar.
