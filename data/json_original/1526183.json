To be fair this may have been down to the booking agency, though the dates the receptionist gave us for when we were supposed to have booked were completely different to the date when we actually booked, suggesting the hotel had our booking mixed up with someone else. The area is horrible and we were harassed by beggars a couple of times walking from the tube to the hotel. We could deal with both these problems and they would not stop us booking again as the hotel is convenient for access to central London. HOWEVER (and it is a big however), as others have stated, the rooms are uncomfortably hot and this definitely would prevent us returning to the hotel. Turning the air con down to its lowest setting does ease the problem slightly from unbearable to merely stifling. It was impossible to get a good nights sleep. This is a shame as the hotel is good for the price. The rooms are small, but not too small, and they are comfortable with good complimentary refreshments, tea, coffee, biscuits etc. Didn't use the bar but it also looked nice.

We in general found the same experiences as just about everyone else who has reviewed the property in this forum - both good and bad - but what was unique about our experience was the entertainment of having the police called by Adil the 'owner' of the hotel to attempt to throw us out after my attempting to 'discuss' an incorrect bill. The hotel website <http://www.qualitymaitrise.com/index.html> clearly states that \"OUR VIP Room offer added benefits such as free daily passes to Bannantyne Health Club located three minutes walk from the hotel, cooked breakfast , chocolates on the pillow, complimentary still and sparkling water, and ELSYL range of toiletries and 15% discount at Rafkins.\" We never saw a single health club pass, and after providing over \u00a32500 of custom to the property over the period of 4 weeks, I was presented with a month-end bill for food at Raskins (it's hard to figure what to call it; it's not a restaurant, more like in in-house canteen) that included extra costs for cooked breakfasts that were supposed to be included with the VIP room rate, and nowhere was there evidence of having received the offered 15% discount for the various dinners and drinks. When I challenged this incorrect bill, the in-house staff were unable to do anything about it, and when I requested 'head office' to call me about it, I was rudely rebuffed by the company accountant who was the acting manager. Escalation to the 'Director' who was named Adil the owner resulted in his trying to apply an abusive ploy at intimidation and coercion with an attempt to turf my family out on the street with less than one hour notice. The local police were summoned by the Owner/Director to apply pressure for me to not only cave in to paying an extra \u00a390 for the incorrect breakfast charges and non-existent discount, but also to leave the hotel immediately with an ill son with fever. The Owner/Director was dismissive and non-responsive but finally we agreed to a settlement that included his voluntary inducement to \"write off\" the entire food bill, so that my family and I would leave the hotel immediately (instead of extending for several days to suit our travel plan). The police told me that the Owner/Director had complained that I was 'disturbing the peace' by seeking redress for the incorrect bill (despite my having taking no more threatening action than writing an e-mail). As soon as the police left the building, the Owner/Director went back on his word and undertaking with the police and not only charged the full food bill without corrrection or discount, but did so without first providing me with a final bill or opportunity to review and approve the charges to the charge card on file. The police were very heavy handed in trying to force me to submit to the Owner's administrative abuse and when I called back to enquire about the broken agreement in front of them only just moments before, I was told that there is nothing they can do, and that I can reference the file number in going to small claims court (as if I've got time for that on a limited time trip from America!). The general staff were trying to do the right thing, but the management of the hotel not only provided no customer service atttitude, but also went back on a verbal agreement in front of police. I had to endure another police visit that evening to assure my family's ability to stay an extra night to allow my son to recover his health and us to find another more hospitable property. Bottom line is that stay if you want but get everything explicitly in writing and do not trust anything that management say to you; also check your bill very carefully before you leave, my bill had a spurious charge of \u00a3297 plus the incorrectly applied cooked breakfast charges. Do not expect an ounce of customer service attitude from management and don't bother paying \u00a34.75 for Soup of the Day it's likely to be from a can probably from Tesco across the street despite being described on the menu as being 'freshly prepared in-house'. And the \"bar\" in Rafkins hasn't had working beer taps for months so hope you like bottled beer (you'll have to ask for a glass to drink it). Maintenance is also not a strong suit in the rooms as the first room we had did not have an operative air-conditioner, which is essential even in November because the windows are nailed shut, and the second room had loose light fixtures and broken toilet accessories that were not attended to for the whole stay.", "Date": "December 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mumbai (Bombay), India", "Title": "\u201cGreat Value for Money\u201d", "Author": "AMehere", "ReviewID": "UR121183249", "Content": "Stayed at the hotel on a business trip from Nov,6th onwards for 5 days.

When the confirmation came through it did state the room had no window so we were expecting that. On arrival at the check-in the receptionist asked if we still wanted a twin room. We said yes, and she asked her other colleague on reception to 'do her a favour' and gave her our room key. She disappeared off and when she returned the first receptionist asked her 'Is it ok?' to which she replied 'yes'. It all looked very peculiar We were then given the key and on first glance the room looked fine with plea sant decor and a stong smell of air freshner (as though perhaps it had just been sprayed). The twin room was compact and. very hot. We put the air con on and it soon cooled down. However, we quickly noticed that the air con unit was dripping from the ceiling onto the carpet and on closer inspection I would think this is a pretty regular occurance as there were water marks on the base of the bed. I went to tell the lady on reception who seemed to be surprised but I suspect they are aware of this as a problem. They offered to move us immediately but they had no more twin rooms, meaning my friend and I had to share a very small double bed, which isn't ideal if you are not a couple and does not make for the best night's sleep. Also the room was so hot (it was November!) and we needed air con on all night, which was noisy. We used the toilet downstairs near reception which was filthy dirty and had no lock. It clearly had not been cleaned for sometime, which I always see as a marker for how much the hotel cares about cleanliness and its customers. The pros: It's a short walk from Kilburn Park Tube, there is a safe and mini fridge in room, a great shower and a tesco express across the road for supplies. You can also leave luggage in a safe room.

However, on our first night the hotel was incredibly hot, air conditioning did little to temper the heat (and we were staying on the first weekend in November) and when I suggested tot he receptionist the following morning that the heating was too high it took a while for her to take on board my feedback, instead suggesting that I didn't know how to use the air conditioning (all of our group were wilting overnight!). Anyhow, when we returned later that day the heating had been adjusted to a much more suitable temperature. The hotel has a bar but it closes at 11pm. Kind of pointless??

On entering room 202, i noticed that it was small, yet stylish, but there was a strange smell. This appeeared to be coming from a very large damp patch on the carpet next to the open bathroom door. Now, I'm a tolerant person, and I know these things can happen when people stay in hotels and don't always look after the rooms as well as they would their own home, so I didn't make a fuss. However, it became apparant that the carpet wasn't just stained it was actually wet. never the less, I said nothing and spent night there. The following evening, my colleague and I had some work to do, so grabbed some food and headed back to my room. She also commented on the smell and the stain when we enetered. Having stayed on my own, I hadn't at this point bothered to close the bathroom door, however, my colleague paid a visit, and when she exited the Bathroom, closed the door behind her. That's when we saw it. A mushroom growing out of the carpet and skirting boards behind the bathroom door. And not just a bit of fungus - a full mushroom, about 1.5 inches in height. Not only is this revolting, but it begs the question - how long has it been since the room has been properly cleaned? I would imaging a mushroom to take at least a couple of weeks to grow, no? I immediately headed down to the front desk and reported the problem. I was met with shock, admittedly, but also that the hotel was full and they couldn't move me. They assured me they would move me in the morning and apologised again. However, I had to ask them to at least come and take care of it - no offer was made to remove the offending item. To this I was met with 'I'll see if I can get someone from the restaurant to take care of it', which doesn't inspire me that hygiene is at the forefront of their minds - I mean, did it end up in the breakfast the day after? After about an hour, the desk clerk, having been unable to source someone suitable from the restaurant to take care of this, knocked on my door, 'picked' the mushroom from the carpet and gave the rest of the damp and stained carpet a half-hearted rub with a sink sponge and some non-descript cleaner spray. She was again apologetic, but generally useless to my plight - I could have done what she did myself using gear out of the bathroom. The following morning, I packed and moved out of the room. When I returned from work, I was given a new room (fungus free) on the third floor - 302. This room was fine (as long as I try and avoid the memory of next doors banging headboard at 3am). The following morning I checked out quickly due to having a busy day, fully intending to address the whole matter with the hotel management on my return home. However, on my return home, and checking my reciept, not only had they not comped any part of my previous 2 nights in a room that, frankly, defies all health and safety laws, but they had the cheek to charge me more for my third night - presumably the higher floor made it a VIP room, and yet there was absolutely no difference in the facilities, products, size or standard of the room that warranted an additional \u00a316 charge. One could argue that I actually had more for less in the cheaper room, although I only wanted room, not a mush-room. I will never stay at this hotel again. Regardless of whether or not the mushroom was isolated to one room, it says a lot about the standard of cleanliness. Clearly the rooms aren't cleaned thoroughly, otherwise the fungus wouldn't have matured so beautifully.

Our room was very nice, the bed was a little hard and there was a large pane of glass leaning on the wall at one side of the bed, when we drew back the curtains we realised this was the secondary double glazing and as it was freezing outside we decided to replace it ourselves! The room itself was not very big, it was a struggle for both of us to walk round the bottom of the bed at the same time. The mattress was also quite hard. Ans there was a long blonde hair on the bedside table! Eww! We went downstairs to Rafkins Bar and Restaurant after seeing what they had to offer on an advert in the lift and on leaflets left out on our bed. The restaurant serves until 10.30 and has a good selection of drinks. However not much of the food advertised in the room or in the lift were on the actual restaurant menu which we found a bit strange. It was a bit of a struggle ordering as the staff did not speak fantastic English, a couple on the next table ordered a Corona and ended up with a Coke and I ordered Sherry Trifle and ended up with Apple and Raspberry crumble (this wasn't even mentioned on the menu so I have no idea where it came from!!!!). The food we ordered was very good though. We got back to our room and this was the first time we had taken our shoes off. We realised that there were big soggy patches on the carpet, it definitely wasn't from our shoes and was very wet to walk on. At this point it was around midnight so we decided to leave the matter and mention it on check out. The room we were in (301) was very noisy. It was right next to the lift and where the maid trolley was kept so you could hear people walking past all night and then the maids chatting about uniforms in the morning. You could also hear noise from upstairs and every hour or so we were woken through out the night by a loud clicking and squeaking noise which we assumed was the heating. Amazingly though, there was no noise from Kilburn High Road. The only saving grace was the shower. It was amazing even if the door was broken and sprayed water all over the bathroom floor. When we were about to check out there was a knock on the door, even though we had the 'Do Not Disturb' sign on the door. It was a random man with a key card in his hand. He wasn't wearing a uniform but said he had to fit the pane of glass in the room for us and it would only take a minute. I explained that we had already done it ourselves and he scuttled off, key in hand! When we checked out we weren't even asked if we had had a good stay, the girl on reception was probably too cold to think about asking! So I mentioned that the carpet was soaking wet in the room.

I arrived late (9pm)to check in after meeting friends all day in London. I was told I did not have a room and they had no contact details to contact me from as their reservation sytem is USELESS! They had overbooked 6 rooms that night, and I heard this was not the first time. They told us they had a room at their sister hotel in Wembley 2 tube stations away (it was 6 and meant extra exspense, it was in zone 4!). The hotel was horrible and toilet seat was not cleaned, staff were terrible! It was a 30 minute taxi ride from Maitrise. They arranged a taxi to Wembley and back again so I could make my way into Central London. I was told I could have a taxi back to Wembley at the end of my night. WRONG! They left me in the pouring rain to make my way back to Wembley. I had to liaise with the taxi company myself, who went out of their way to collect me (after standing in rain for 50 mins). The taxi company could clearly see the poor attitude of the management at this hotel as they actually lied to me about the return tax, the driver felt sorry for me! Mr Ali Imran (so called Manager) be ashamed of yourself! We met an Austrian couple who was in the same predicament, not a good impression to make on foreign visitors to England!! If you are booking to stay at this hotel don't! If you must, check that your reservation is confirmed and pray that you get what you want because Mr Imran and Mr Lopez will not go out of their way for you or provide good, decent customer service!

I went there based on the reviews of this site, so I felt confident that I was getting a good deal. I was right. The rooms are cozy and modern. It being London for about 100 quid a night (or less), this fits the bill well. The rooms don't leave much for walking around in. And, I wouldn't want to use the toilet if I were over 6'3\" or 225 pounds. But, for us average-sized people, it's a cozy place to hang out and hang your head. It's probably most appropriate as a nice base for going out on the town and needing a comfy bed and modern amenities. Although, my girlfriend did not like their shampoo and the bathroom soap can dry your face. Not to worry though b/c there's a Tesco's across the street. Their restaurant, Rafkins, have good service, although it took 15 minutes to get my breakfast sandwich out of the kitchen.You may need to order some food b/c the continental breakfast is on the light side.

The room was exactly like the pictures on there website, very chic, clean and comfortable with all mod cons, it was abit on the small side (the bed was definiely a standard size - with a lovely feather quilt), theres no denying that, but it did the job, this may have been a problem if you were there for a week but for a weekend break where we planned on spending pretty much every waking hour out in London the room was absolutely fine. It didnt have a window either but I'd say this was actually a plus, as unless you're somewhere really really nice in London the view out of a hotel window isn't going to be anything special and it meant that there was no outside noise and we slept comfortably in a very dark room, they have air con in these rooms to replace the lack of fresh air and it worked fine. Its essentially opposite a train station too which is 5 mins from Euston so its easy to get everywhere. All in all a great stay and will be visiting again.
