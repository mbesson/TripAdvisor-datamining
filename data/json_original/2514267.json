I booked a one night stay in a family room for 4, for one night at the Earls Court Garden Hotel for myself and 3 friends. \u00a375 for the four of us. Very Cheap for London for four. The one positive thing is location to Earls Court Tube Station. About 2 minutes walking. Now the negatives. Where do i start!!! A family room which shows you in the pictures as four beds is not. Its 2 dirty bunk beds!! Any family planning on staying. Don't do it. Not for you or your kids. Its filthy. Dirty carpet that is older than myself i would imagine and last saw a clean maybe last year. The booking will lead you to believe that you have your own bathroom, not true, its a communal style cupboard/shower room with a 1970's shower head and a sink with no warm water and a tiny shower curtain that is good for nothing. So if you're on the 3rd floor like us, you must go downstairs for warm water. No curtains in the room on one window, instead a Sainsburys bag hanging in the window to block the light out. What the website doesn't tell you that you are right under a tube line. So every six minutes from 6 am you will be woken by the tube until 1 in the morning. Tea making facilities - nope. 4 plastic cups that you would get from a water dispensing machine. You'd probably scald your hands if you poured hot water in there, that's if they didn't melt from the hot water in the first place. Nowhere to lock valuables, and the door to the family room could have been knocked open without any force. None of this is exaggerated.

London was fully booked these days (Frieze art fair + BFI film festival) so I had to take advantage of this 45\u00a3 sort of deal for a double room with single use. I got there at 7:30pm and was 'welcomed' by a young guy who showed no interest, no enthusiasm and asked \u00a310 for a key deposit, which I was sure I would have never seen again (but instead I did, the morning after!). My room was on first floor, with a tiny window overlooking the underground. I literally couldn't close my eyes after 5am, as trains were passing EVERY single minute. Room was dirty, wallpapers were falling off the walls and some strange holes on the ceiling made me feel uncomfortable. I checked the room for cockroaches and fortunately didn't find any, but I had a brief encounter with one during a late night pee in the first floor toilet which scared the hell out of me. There was a 'nice' bathroom on the second floor - definitely the best and cleanest in the whole building - where the only shower was running. The heating was so high it was almost unbearable, but I had to wash a few pairs of socks and they happened to be dry in minutes... The hotel is a couple minutes walk from Earl's Court tube stop, so I'd say the location is good, at least. The reception guy made a mistake with my payment (made me pay \u00a35 less for my room, so the day after he only gave me \u00a35 back from the key deposit).

I wasn't expecting the room to be big. I wasn't expecting the room to be comfy. I was expecting the room to be clean and for the staff to be at least a little interested in the quality of their guests' stay. Apparently even this was too much to ask. To start off our awful experience, we arrived at the hotel after midnight, so nobody was in the reception to give us our key. Instead we had to phone another hotel and let them know we we had arrived. When I phoned I was told I would have to come and pick up my keys from the other hotel. When I asked how to get there I was told there should be directions on the door of the Earl's Court Gardens hotel. There was an arrow pointing right. When I told the man on the phone that that was all there was he proceeded to reel off a list of directions and then got annoyed at me when I had to ask him to repeat the directions, since we had gone the wrong way and had gotten lost. After all that we finally got to the other hotel and, after settling our bill and paying the key deposit, we were given the key to our room. There was a slight confusion with our money (\"What's this?\" \"Pounds stirling. It's Scottish money\" \"Do you have any British money?\" \"Last time I checked Scotland was part of Britain\") but to be honest I should have expected that since I usually run into problems with Scottish money when visiting England. There was also a problem considering we owed \u00a368 but did not have change. We gave the receptionist \u00a370 and were given a note explaining that we would have to collect our \u00a32 change from our hotel the next morning and that there would be somebody there from 7am to make sure we got our change. The real problems started when we got into the hotel. We found room 203 with no difficulties, even if it was a bit of a squeeze to get through the doors even with our tiny suitcase. When we got into the room I had to cry. At first glance it looked clean but as soon as we looked up it was a different story. As well as several damp patches on the ceiling there was also a stain which, in the poor lighting we had, we were unable to identify. We decided it was either mould or poo. Either way it was very unpleasant. After this discovery we started inspecting the rest of the room a bit more thoroughly. The wallpaper was coming off the walls in places and the carpet was stained pretty badly underneath the bed. One window did not have curtains and the curtains on the other window were falling off. I opened the cupboard to hang up a dress and changed my mind as soon as I saw how grotty the inside of the cupboard was. If it hadn't been so late we would have left right then and found somewhere else. On top of that there's also the fact that our room looked out onto railway tracks. This meant that we didn't get to sleep until roughly 2am when the trains stopped going past and were woken at 6am when they started again. All in all a very poor night's sleep. We decided it was not worth staying in this hotel any longer. We phoned travel lodge and booked a room at their Farringdon hotel (which ended up costing us over \u00a3100 we had not been planning on spending), since we at least knew that it would be clean, and got ready to check out. This is when we discovered that on top of everything else the hot water was not working in the shower, the taps did not switch off and there was no soap for washing your hands in the bathroom. We got to the reception at 8.30am (an hour and a half after we were told that there would be someone there with money) and found it unmanned. After a quick call to the main hotel the receptionist dragged himself out of bed to serve us. He told us we would be able to get a refund for the night we were not staying but that there would be no money on the premises until 10.30am when the manager (who we never saw once during the whole ordeal) arrived. This seemed pretty poor to me, especially since the latest you're supposed to be able to check out is 11am and you have to get your \u00a310 key deposit back. I think they just intend to scam an extra \u00a310 out of many of the tourists who stay there. So we handed back the key and filled out a form saying why we were unhappy with our stay (which I refused to sign until I got my money back) and went and had breakfast at the nearby Sainsbury's. At 10.30am we returned. The receptionist told us several times to be patient and wait longer before walking out the door and coming back with some money. However since another couple were wanting to check out by this time he served them first and had to leave again to get the rest of our money. When he returned he gave me the form I had filled out back. When I reminded him that I wasn't signing anything until I got my money he said \"No. You sign here and write 'No complaint' and I give you your money back. Trust me. Right 'No Complaint' otherwise it looks bad for me and I lose my job\". After arguing about this with him for several minutes (because I had a fair few complaints about the room and the customer services) I finally wrote 'No complaint' on the form and we were given our money back. Except for the \u00a32 change which then caused a further argument (I know it's not much but by this point it was the principle of the thing that made me do it). When we left we realised they'd given us all our Scottish notes back, which was the only laugh we got out of the whole thing. Throughout the whole ordeal the receptionist did not apologise once except for a monotonous \"Sorry for your inconvenience\" as we walked out the door. So two and a half hours after we first lodged a complaint and checked out (and four hours after we were told we'd be able to be served), we were able to leave. If I had one piece of advice about staying at this hotel it would be \"Don't\". The rooms are disgusting and the staff couldn't care less about customer satisfaction. I wouldn't wish this hotel on my worst enemy.", "Date": "August 27, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "uk", "Title": "\u201cTerrible!Horrible!Filthy!Worst Ever!\u201d", "Author": "durianking0618", "ReviewID": "UR68173108", "Content": "I am not a picky person, I just want a place to have a shower and rest.

Besides that, there were rat traps underneath the bed, though we haven't spotted any rodents or insects. The shower was filthy and way too small.

In fact I only expect 3 things really: the place should be as described, clean and have a hot shower. Friendly helpful staff are a bonus. Unfortunately this place fails miserably on all counts (including the helpful staff). It is only 30 secs from Earls Court tube station, which in some ways is a handy location, but unfortunately this also means it's right on the train tracks so you get woken up every 5 mins throughout most of the night. It was described as ensuite and having satellite TV in all rooms - it wasn't and didn't. Our ancient and very non-satellite TV was broken, although when we reported this we were told it was meant to be like that. Must be one of those \"snowstorm only\" tellies you hear about. The room was filthy, and there was no hot water in the shower on our floor, although there was a large and conspicuous cockroach trap. When we reported the lack of hot water the first time we got a shrug and an uninterested \"OK\". The second time, we were told \"use another shower\". Another couple overhearing this told us they were checking out early because there had been no hot water on their floor either for several days. We complained about everything again when we left and the reponse was unapologetic: \"if you didn't like it why did you stay?\" Believe me we tried not to! but as the bloke must have known, central London on a weekend in August isn't exactly heaving with vacant hotel rooms. Thank God we were only booked in for 2 nights. His parting shot to us was \"we'll make sure everything is OK for your next stay\" Next stay?? Somehow I think not.

Yes this must be not only a front-runner for britain's worst hotel (or cesspit) but in the whole world! To think there might be anywhere worst well then it must be literally hell on earth. I am a young guy and i have stayed in some pretty bad places on my travels but i have never quite experienced somewhere like this and i had definately never walked out after staying just one night when i had booked for 5!!! Luckily they made up some excuse about the card machine not working and i managed to get away with only paying for two in advance with cash. However no matter what i was offered i could NEVER spend another night in that place let alone anywhere within a 5 mile radius!! I do not agree with the comment that \"its so bad its comical\" its SOOOOO much worse. I have also never feared for my life before going to sleep but i was at the mercy to any freak that one forgetful night!!

Sadly I'll never be able to completely forget my one night there. I've stayed in some pretty bad, very cheap places, but this is the the worst. I was only in London to pick up a visa then fly out to Korea the next day. For one night a bed is a bed, I reasoned, and if it's close to the Tube.... When I arrived, the man in the cubby hole/reception spoke very little English, just enough to let me know this was cash only. I left my bags there and went out in search of cash. On return the man pointed the way up to my room. I dragged my two large bags up narrow winding staircases to a room that was only slightly bigger than the queen sized bed. I didn't need to use the wardrobe which was just as well as it couldn't be opened because the bed was in the way, and it looked like the door would fall off if I tried. The bathrooms were shared - there were two on my floor, but after glancing into the toilet of the first and wondering if the previous guest had survived that bout of dysentery, I chose to use the second, but for essentials only and as quickly as possible. The hotel is close to the tube- so close in fact that the overground trains run outside the window every two minutes right through the night. I thought of Ellwood and Jake Blues and wondered if you really do get used to it. I lasted 15 minutes before heading to my nephew's new shared student flat - with hindsight, camping on the hard sofa amongst the student debris would have been preferable. I did go back to Earl's Court to sleep and to be fair the sheets were clean and the mattress looked acceptable I left as soon as I woke. It's not a place anyone would want to linger.
