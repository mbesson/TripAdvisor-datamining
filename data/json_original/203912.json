{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Great hotel choice This was a wonderful little hotel in the heart of Florence. On a small little street not far from the train station and close to all the other sites and shopping in Florence. Very clean and good size rooms. We stayed on the 1st day we arrived in Florence and the last day before we left to go home. Both rooms were very nice. We arrived several hours before check-in both days and were allowed to check in early. The staff was very helpful and accommodating. The breakfast was very good and included in the price of the room. Will definitely stay here the next time we are in Florence.", "Date": "Nov 3, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR475657570", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "landlbunch"}, {"Content": "City Love* My husband and I were there just a couple of months ago and had to change hotels because the one we booked online turned out to be terrible. So we walked around one morning and we stumbled upon a 3 star hotel, City Hotel - http://www.hotelcity.net/index.php and it was wonderful! We totally recommend to anyone that wants to stay somewhere comfortable but not pay a whole lot. You are right down the street from the Duomo and walking distance to everywhere! Breakfast is your regular meal with cured meats, cheeses, eggs, wonderful pastries and Dora, the evening receptionist was so kind and helpful! Definitely will come back and stay here again next time we visit!", "Date": "Jul 8, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR177592360", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "shirlita"}, {"Content": "A Hidden Gem Very centrally situated in a little side street not far from the railway station.

The hotel was an easy walk from the airport shuttle or train station, with equally good access to the museums and the duomo. It looked tiny from the outside, but inside was surprisingly spacious, with colorful murals and a very pleasant breakfast room. The breakfast included warmed pastries (a nice touch), yogurt, cereal, fresh fruit, meats, and cheeses. When I asked for decaf coffee, I not only got my own carafe of coffee but also an equally large pitcher of hot milk! I loved it.  Francesco arranged our museum tickets and made terrific restaurant recommendations. Everyone at the desk was warm and gracious.  The only quirk was the shower. Our room (28) did not have a shower stall, just a curtained area that did not completely contain the water. More amusing than a genuine hardship, however. An excellent value for a Florentine hotel.", "Date": "May 13, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR511048146", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "JoynearChicago"}, {"Content": "Italian Elegance at Hotel City We were so very pleased when we walked into this charming hotel! We had booked for the incredibly good location, the air conditioning and the private bathroom, in spite of the humble-sounding name. It was so much lovelier than we had expected! The entryway and sitting rooms are so pleasant, and one is taken by the lovely painted details in the vaulted ceilings. These modestly-sized rooms on the first floor also include a charming breakfast area with stained glass windows. Our room was clean and comfortable and had an antique desk. We visited during the height of the season during the last week of June, and this was an oasis. The staff was very helpful. As we left, I gave a letter to the person at the desk and asked him to mail it.

We were staying in Rome and decided to do a day trip to Florence that turned into an overnight. We went without any reservations, but checked out our guidebook recommendations and tripadvisor reviews. We decided to try the Hotel City because it looked nice, had good reviews, and was close to the train station. When we checked in, we negotiated the price down from $140 Euro to $100 Euro/night, based on our guidebook price range (which we showed the desk attendant), the fact that we had the names of additional hotels, and (most obviously) because it was low-season. Our room was very nice and well-appointed by any standard. The bathroom was very clean and newer, but the shower was really just a curtain in the corner with a floor drain. Although it was somewhat unexpected in such a nice hotel, that was a fine trade-off though for a lovely room on a nice side street with excellent access to both the train station and the Duomo (and the rest of this very walkable city). The continental breakfast was fine. The only downside was that, when we asked to leave our bags until 6pm, we were told that there was no locked room, but we could leave them in the common area by the desk clerk. We stripped our bags of anything of any great value and left them without any problems.", "Date": "Mar 27, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR243417907", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "TravelArtz"}, {"Content": "Not quite as pictured I was a little disappointed with this hotel; I had higher expectations after seeing the website.
