You are better booking on 020-320 41 32. At Gartine I had the tastiest soup ever. The Xtracold Ice Bar is a must and you get 3 free drinks incl in the entry fee (xtracold.com).

The staff is VERY friendly at Sint Nicolaas, the place is kept very clean and safe, and it's in the best location royalty, you won't find it here, but you will find the finest hotel available for under $100 euro. By the way, if you don't appreciate the free breakfast, and haven't been to Amsterdam, you might note that most restaurants in Amsterdam are not open in the morning, and do not serve breakfast at all. It's the effort that matters to me the most, like a free breakfast that don't HAVE to offer it's visitors, and that's what separates Sint Nicolaas from other hotels, they want you to be comfortable.", "Date": "November 19, 2002"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cHighly recommended\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR634990", "Content": "In reply to a negative review I have just read about this charming hotel. I feel it is totally unjustified. I am a regular visitor to Amsterdam (at least 5 business trips a year) & have stayed at the Sint Nicolaas hotel for the last 12 years. The standard of hospitality & friendliness cannot be beaten. This is 1 of the only 2 star hotels offering an elevator and the gentleman from Scotland complains that it is making a loud noise! I suggest that next time he stays in a hotel without an elevator and experience the Dutch steep staircases! The generous breakfast is FREE, which is also unusual in Amsterdam! The staff are very polite and go out of their way to assist. I am perplexed to hear that his experience was negative & can only conclude that this gentleman is perhaps a very unhappy man. I recommend this hotel highly to all my friends & business relations.", "Date": "July 2, 2002"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cStaying at the Hotel Sint Nicolaas\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR605242", "Content": "I recently stayed here for 5 nights and was very disappointed with this hotel based on the amount it was charging (the same as 4* in Scotland). The rooms were reasonably clean but dull and the bathroom had a bit of damp, and was not always very clean. The breakfast was very disappointing, ham and cheese sandwiches with some butter and jam, every morning. The staff were not particularly friendly. The hotel had an old lift that made a terrible noise, and woke us up every morning as soon as guests started to go for breakfast. The stairs were wooden and old, so also very noisy. I asked to be moved rooms, and was told that I was in the quiet room, as the traffic was noisy on the other side of the hotel. However, the hotel is in an excellent location, only 5 minutes walk from the train station and 5 minutes walk to Dam square, and there was a lovely Chinese/Indianesion restaurant next door to the hotel.", "Date": "June 6, 2002"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Sint Nicolaas", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g188590-d237568-Reviews-Hotel_Sint_Nicolaas-Amsterdam_Noord_Holland.html", "Price": "$175 - $302*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Spuistraat 1A</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Amsterdam</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">1012 SP</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">The Netherlands</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "237568", "ImgURL": "http://www.venere.com/img/hotel/8/1/1/3/103118/103118.jpg"}}
