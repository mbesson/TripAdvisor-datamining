When I arrived I was rudely greeted and abruptly sent up to a room on the first floor. I had a sense of foreboding as I walked along the dirty worn corridor. When I unlocked the door to my room I found it was a dirty, dingy and not much bigger than a cupboard. It had torn curtains, stained carpets, was dirty and it smelt. Directly outside the window was a large noisy industrial unit sending out vibrations that made the windows buzz. It was clear you could never get any sleep in the room. There were not even any pillows on the bed. I asked for another room and they moved me to one further along the hallway that was a little bigger but still very small and cramped. This too had stains on the floor, ripped curtains, paint peeling on the walls, mould in the bathroom, was dirty and smelt of damp. The only saving grace is that it was a little further away from the noisy units at the rear of the hotel. I was informed though that is was one of their best rooms!! By this point I was tired and it was too late to find another hotel so I gave in and had to accept the room. That night I tired to make a cup of tea. The kettle blew up (smoke and sparks) electrocuting me when I tried to turn it on. They then tested/set off the fire alarms repeatedly at 11.30pm. On and off until they had made sure they had got everyone in the building up. No apology was made for this to any of the guests. Finally through the droning of the industrial units to the rear of the hotel I managed to get to sleep. I was up early the next morning and so was everyone else in the hotel as workmen were hammering and banging around the corridors from around 7am. I had to get up but I am not sure the poor people on their holidays would have appreciated it. When I came back up from breakfast, which was nothing spectacular and certainly does not live up to the promises on their website, I found my room key no longer worked. I had to go up and down to reception 4 times before I could get back into my room. This was the final straw and I asked to speak to a manager to complain. The staff and the purported manager could not care less about the complaint so I gave up. To add insult they then tried to charge me \u00c2\u00a312 per night higher than the published rate for the room I had stayed in when I came to pay.

I would like to recommend your duty manager to Fernando Peire, Director of Ivy restaurant, who does the ''TV Restaurant Inspector'' on Channel 5.

The hotel couldn't be more conveniently placed within very easy walking distance of 2 tube stations - I mean VERY easy walking distance.

The window frames were rotting, a knob was missing on a drawer, the carpet was stained, the paint in the bathroom was peeling & dirt had built up in the less easy areas to reach - behind the TV, in the corners of the room etc. However, the bed was clean & very comfortable & the shower powerful & hot - just don't look up at the dirty shower head! Breakfast was good - a good selection of cold meats, hams, fruit & pastries for the continental option & a well cooked traditional English breakfast. You have to go into the lounge adjoining the restaurant to make your own toast which isn't convenient. You also have to serve yourself to cups of tea/coffee &, since I have to drink a vast quantity of tea before I wake up in the morning, I'd have preferred to have a pot on my table - maybe if I'd thought to ask they could have let me have one.

At which point we were handed menus (hastily snatched from a nearby table and displaying only about 6 items to choose from) then came an awkward pause. After a few seconds of standing in the aisle clutching the menus the waitresses training kicked in and she offered to seat us \"ummmmmmmm somewhere round here\" Ok, not the best starts but we'll press on. After about 5 mins the waitress re-appears to take a drinks order, I order a drink but my wife doesn't (it's happy hour by the way, buy one get one free, this wasn't pointed out to us) a couple of mins later the waitress comes back with my drink and takes our order. my wifes first choice - not in stock my wifes second choice - not in stock my wifes third choice - yay, result! my first choice - not in stock my second choice - yay, result!......They really didn't expect customers did they, not only do they have a pityful selection but half of that isn't even in stock. My wife had a Rocket salad which, whilst it looked half wilted, she enjoyed. I had a foccacia club sandwich (can't go wrong there i'd said to myself.) Now traditionally a club sandwich is Turkey (or chicken) bacon, lettuce and tomato..............I ended up with a ham and cheese sandwich between 2 slabs of cardboard like foccaia bread. Ok, time to leave................where's the waitress? do you know? i didn't! Oh there she is! I think to myself as she peeks around the corner with that same (blimey customers, what do i do now?) expression. Much to her relief we'd given up on food and left. Breakfast was an altogether different affair, there were customers! Same waitress again, and again looking shocked at these people milling around and forcing her to work. Seated after about 5 mins, no offer of tea/coffee (even though there were other waiters doing so for their tables,) no offer of anything else for that matter, in fact we didn't see a single staff member again until we gladly checked out.

I was alone for the first three nights and with friends the other four,but had my own room the entire time. My stay was broken up into 5 nights (went to paris for a night) and then 2 nights in a separate room. The hotel is about a five minute cab ride from Paddington Station,at a cost of 8-10 pounds for the cab ride. My single room cost me 70 pound/nt (my friends twin room was 85 pounds). Its a nice enough looking hotel on a quiet street,and the lobby looks as nice as a lobby in your basic Choice Hotel/Holiday Inn/Hampton Inn chains. There is a 24 hour reception desk so it was quite safe for a single female. My inital room(May 10-14) was pretty small,resembled an inside cabin on a cruise ship.It had a twin bed,3 drawer dresser/desk and a closet.The bathroom was small but had a tub/shower combo.It was prety tight but I didn't spend too much time in it,just the last hour or two before I went to bed and getting ready in the morning,so it was good enough for the price.That particular room location( I think it was room 207) was pretty quiet,I didnt hear any of the Tube noses that I had read about before on the forums. It was pretty out of the way though,but it was nice b/c it felt secure and private. The bed was surpisingly comfortable for a twin.My only complaint about the room would be that is was a bit chilly-I had the heater cranked up the entire time to maintain a room temp like atmosphere.The water pressure in the bathroom was great and there was plenty of hot water. My room for the final two nights was a bit better in terms of space (room 128) It had steps leading down to the room so the floorplan seemed more open and spacious than the first room had. However,on these two nights I COULD hear the Tube running,and it did get a little distracting. As for the hotel's bar/restaurant/breakfast...ehhh...can't say I'm a fan.Breakfast was a bunch of raw meat,some fruit and yogurt,and croissants with coffee/juice. I only ate there twice(it was included in the price of my room),and only had a quick croissant and jam.I didn't linger. The hostess never attempted to seat me with anyone,although there weren't that many tables,I found a seat by myself for the few minutes I was in there. the \"bar\" was actually a room off the lobby with a few armchairs and a TV,and a little bar off to the side. It wasn't always staffed,but if you asked the receptionist they would come over and serve you something. It was technically open 24 hours though,as I found out... As for the restaurant,it was Italian based and they did provide room service up to 1030pm,but the selection was pretty limited.Unless you were desperate for a meal and could not walk for a second,I would walk the 1/2 block to Queensway for a meal. Location-as I said,if you walk out the front foors,make a right,walk about three feet,make another right,walk another three feet,you are at Quuensway Blvd.On this street,the Bayswater Tube station is within eyesight of the corner that you approach it on.The Queensway tube is at the end of the street on the left,by the entrance to the Kensington Gardens/Hyde Park,but due to the zillions of stairs I'd try to use Bayswater as much as possible. In either direction on Queensway there are souvenir shops,internet cafes,restaurants(I recommend the waffle house for breakfast,going towards Queensway Tube),American fast food chains(pretty much all of them!),Barclays Bank(partner of Bank of America,so withdrawals are free for BOA customers) money exchange places,pubs,and a casino.The restaurants seem to stay open pretty late. As I said,Kensington Gardens and Hyde Park are a 5 minute walk away,and the two tube lines from Bayswater take you pretty much anywhere else.It was a superb location,unless you HAVE to be right in the midst of Covent Garden,but I dont think its worth the added price myself. My only legitimate complaint about the hotel would e the night receptionist. On our second to last night,he was chatting with one of my friends in the bar,and he claimed to be a palm reader. He \"read her palm\" and told her some stuff that made her pretty upset,which,looking back,was probably just him hitting on her. Very unprofessional. I wouldn't advise hanging out in the bar because of this.", "Date": "June 10, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "England", "Title": "\u201cHotel needs renovating\u201d", "Author": "Kangarookate", "ReviewID": "UR67005139", "Content": "Stayed at hotel for 2 nights only - thank goodness.

The hotel itself is a bit 'tired' looking. Our room (a twin) which I shared with my 11 year old son, was small, the bathroom even smaller, with barely enough space to dry yourself after a shower. The blind in the bathroom looked a bit mouldy and the whole place could have done with a lick of paint. The carpets were threadbare, and as others on here have said, the floorboards are incredibly squeaky. The hotel is far from quiet, as it sounds like the tube line runs underneath it, every few minutes there's an almightly rumbling noise. Didn't bother us too much, as we live on a busy main road so are used to noise, but I'd imagine anyone who's used to more peaceful nights would have struggled. Also, we were on the 3rd floor, so it must have been a lot worse on the 1st and 2nd floors. We only ate breakfast in the hotel, and whilst the food was good, it was completely unorganised. People were having to wait 15 mins to be seated, then having to share tables with others, they kept running out of things (cups, plates, etc) and the staff seemed to be running around like headless chickens with no one taking responsibility for managing them. Good points, other than the location, were the bedding (very nice and new looking goose down duvets), the towels and the facilitly to leave luggage in a secure room before/after check in/out.

How 3 years have changed it! The website claims they are constantly striving to enhance & improve the hotel but it seems a lot worse than when we stayed the first time! 3 Years ago we had a really fantastic sized room for a brilliant price. We paid a lot more this time but we stayed in the tiniest room with the creakiest floorboards ever. The bathroom sink was blocked, when I was trying to unblock it a bit of lettuce along with other peoples hair floated up which just made me feel ill! Eventually Reception sent someone up to unblock it which lasted for about a day before it blocked up again. The carpet had dark red (wine?) stains on it and alot of it was frayed around the edges. The TV's are too big for the small rooms, I am not a big person but learly knocked it off the shelf trying to get through the gap between it and the bed! I think luckily we didnt want to spend alot of time in the room because if we had wanted to chill out in it, it wouldnt of been possible. We went down for breakfast on the first morning and the lady in charge tried to sit us at the same table as another couple who looked completely horrified at having to share their table with us, we asked if there was anywhere else for us to sit - This question resulted in the manager coming out and making my boyfirend wait outside! I left the breakfast room then as it just seemed comletely disorganised and ridiculous! And I could more than understand the other couples reluctance to have 2 strangers seated practically on top of them at breakfast! There is a wonderful Spanish restairant up the road that do fantastic breakfasts for around \u00c2\u00a36- \u00c2\u00a37 & also plenty of other restaurants & cafes near by - If you stay here, go for room only and go out for breakfast! Be aware that the breakfast included in the B&B price is continental and like all hotels they charge a stupid amount (\u00c2\u00a310) to upgrade it to Full English Also we paid for the hotel at the beginning of the stay which I found a little odd but thought nothing more of it until we tried to check out. We originally booked two nights on the internet but I then changed it to 3 nights about 2 weeks before our visit. We were charged what we thought was the right amount at the beginning of our stay but as we checked out they told us we hadnt and we still need to pay an extra \u00c2\u00a3100. To be honest at that point due to various issues we were at the end of our tether with the hotel and didnt feel that it was worth the extra \u00c2\u00a3100 and we took the hotel manager on duty up to our room to show him and explained about the disastorous breakfast incident and the blocked sink. Unfortunately this visit left us with a bad taste in our mouths which was a real shame as our first visit had been so lovely. We also took the oppourtunity to ask other hotels in the area their prices and saw some of their rooms which were much nicer, more modern and less creaky. I really didnt want to come away feeling like this about the hotel & was so dissappointed! It is in a fantastic location but if you can get another hotel in the same area (there are 4 or 5 others) then do, I'm sure your stay will be happier.

We had a mixed experience. The first room we were in was on the 1st floor (or second floor by American terms) and would have been fine if we were just a couple. Unfortunately, it was too small with a portable crib and we barely had any room to move around. Nevermind that there were several steps leading down into the room which made it difficult to get a stroller in and out and we had to keep an eye on our toddler. The other downside to the room was that we were on the level with the floodlights that lit up the hotel's exterior at night. Despite closing the curtain, the light still seeped in. We complained to the hotel staff and to their credit, they did shut off the lights early the next night. Since this was the :\"balcony\" level, we, being paranoid New Yorkers, chose not to open the massive windows/doors at night so it was stuffy. After two nights in our too small room and tempers flaring, we asked to be moved. We were assigned to a room on the third floor and we had a much different experience. There were no steps and we actually had room to move around with the portable crib open. We also had a proper window and could keep it open to allow for air circulation. If we had this room for all four nights, it would have been a much better experience for us as a family. Overall, the hotel was fine. The carpets are worn and stained, you can see the edges of wallpaper peeling, etc. but we considered it all part of the price level that we were willing to pay for. Our rooms were clean. The hotel staff was helpful. We were able to use the wi-fi in both rooms. The breakfast was good. The location was fantastic.

They sent us to the hotel next door and claimed it was 4-star hotel, I forgot the name of this hotel (I reference it as hotel B). When we checked in this \"hotel B\", found the room size small - barely fit for 2 twin beds. The smallest bathroom with a bath tube, a wash basin and a standing area. The \"hotel B\" did not offer wireless internet as we booked with the original \"hotel A\" and no breakfast facility. The room window had a brocken latch, it could not be closed.

It would be very hard for them to contact us if we switched to another hotel.

We wondered the truth about the so-called \"maintenance problem\" which they had never specified. We had prepaid our hotel charge with Low Price Guaranteed in January 2009.

We arrived in the afternoon and were quite surprised to be kept waiting for half an hour before being let into our room at the official check in at 1500, even though we'd arranged for an early check in when booking the room. We had pretty good expectations for the room, as the lobby looked modern and inviting, and had a plaque on the wall stating it was a runner up for the \"best hotel in britain award\" (or something likethat) a couple of years earlier. However, the room was at the end of a smelly, dark corridor on the ground floor. The room was small and cramped with three beds (was supposed to be a \"family room\") and the looks overall was very shabby. My wife and myself both are NOT very picky when it comes to hotel rooms, but it took about 0.5 seconds to decide that THIS was NOT where we intended to stay for our 5 day vacation! That was before the subway went rumbling by half a meter under the room... every three minutes form 0500-2400 as it turned out... I went to the lobby, ready to raise h*** and contact our booking agency if necessary, but managed to remain friendly.... We could not change rooms the same day, but were told that the next we would get a \"superior\" room on an upper floor, as the hotel was full (plausible, as this was the sunday of the London Marathon!). The night in our room was the worst ever, and I tell you that spending the night with a fully awake, cranky and travel weary 4 year old, while the subway shakes the whole room all night is NOT the way you want to spend your holiday. The next day we were given a room on the third floor which was bigger and better, but very noisy. Apparantly London does not have any regulations regarding noise pollution, as the room faced a back yard where an assortment of fans, air conditioners etc. made a lot of noise - and the windows were single layer, of course. The bathroom was extremely small. Carpets had strange stains and was approx. 30 years old. The door to our room had a gap between it and the floor that was about 4 cm, so we heard everything in the hallway... But that's what earplugs are for, right?? HOWEVER: It was clean, there were enough towels, beds were changed every day and the staff didn't complain when we informed them our daughter had an accident in her bed. The room was very cold, but when I asked, the reception had a radiator brought to our room. The breakfast was not at all bad, and the concierge was helpful with checking a couple of things for us and getting transportation. All in all we had a quite pleasant stay, but we probably won't come back. If you plan on staying at this hotel, make sure you get a room on the top floor, facing the street. Then, at least , you will have some quiet. PS: The hotel homepage does not lie. The beds really were new and quite OK; there were real down pillows and duvets.

This place does all they can to suck every dollar out of you, and gives you absolutely no quality service in return. The beds are god awful uncomfortable. You know the commercials for mattresses where every square inch contours to your body? Well, imagine that kind of bed, except its more like every square yard contours. You can't lay on your side period, and it's uncomfortable to lay on your back. The rooms are as small as you'd expect from a European hotel, so no surprises there. However the absolute worst part of the trip, and where I see no excuse for failure is that of the hotel staff. The front desk customer service is non-existent. I received a bill for 45 pounds for local phone calls. If you are going to charge for local calls fine, but you also need to let people know that. I made only local calls and was charged 45 pounds.

I'm used to american hotels where if a hotel is booked, they will call other hotels for you and help you find a new place.

And near the hotel are various restaurants, some cuzy pubs, shops and supermarkets. The area is pretty lively even at night, but the hotel is located in a quieter street. The reception staff was friendly, even though some lines seemed a bit 'rehearsed'. We were asked to leave a 50 GBP deposit and we received a discount voucher for the hotel restaurant. The lobby looked nice, and the hallways of the hotels smelled pretty good with the aid of air-freshner. We booked a twin, but in the room was a double bed. Considering this bed was pretty big (Queensize) and there was an extra duvet, we decided not to make a fuss about it. The room was located on the frontside of the hotel and the outdoor spotlight was lighting our room in a very sun-like manner. This was not a problem since the thick curtain hid the light completely, it was a nice touch actually! The room definately needed some updating, especially the carpet. It all looked a little bit dated and shabby, but the bed linen was absolutely clean and so was the bathroom. The beds were made every day and when requested the linen would be changed. Huge towels in the bathroom also. The TV only had a few channels and wasn't working very well, but we weren't visiting in London to watch tv! The size of the room was ok. We had an absolutely quiet night and we could hardly hear the tube (on the first floor). I'd stayed here before a couple of years ago and remembered that it's not the most fantastic hotel in the world, but if you're looking for a budget hotel with a great location, and if you're not picky about the look of a hotel room then this is definately a good option.", "Date": "January 28, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Netherlands", "Title": "\u201cBeafeater\u201d", "Author": "Beafeater", "ReviewID": "UR23896406", "Content": "Stayed at the hotel for 3 nights and was concerned after reading reviews.

It was great that they were able to hold our bags for us, as we arrived in London well before the check-in time (we got there around 9am when check it was around 1pm). Since there were 3 of us, our room actually had 3 separate twin size beds, which were actually pretty comfortable. The room size was much better than I thought it would be, considering I read a lot of reviews on London hotels that complained about room size. The bathroom was also a decent size, and the shower always had hot water, and great water pressure. One thing I did find weird, and I noticed this at our other hotel as well, is that you have to literally step up and into the shower, so if you can't make the step up, it would be difficult to use the shower (esp for any older individuals or anyone with any disabilities). The one complaint we did have, was that (and I believe it happened to be our room, given it's location - room 60) the tube station was apparently directly underneath us, so you could hear the trains running - at least they stopped at midnight, and usually didn't start again till around 6am. Also, the room was FREEZING. *Note: I found that wherever I stayed or went indoors in London, it was always freezing, so it must just be a common trend and not something specific to this hotel. We had the continental breakfast while we stayed there. The breakfast \"bar\" included pastries, juices, coffee / tea, meats / cheeses, fruit, yogurt, and cereal. No complaints regarding the breakfast. Overall, the hotel and staff were great - I really enjoyed the location as it's very close to 2 tube stations, tons of restaurants, some pubs and shops.

After searching on orbitz and expedia I found a variety of interesting properties at attractive rates but Hyde Park Towers had special rates on both sites that were really hard to beat. I read a ton of reviews here on tripadvisor that were not entirely positive but I booked anyway as the rate was sweet and I'm not a finicky traveler. I must say I was very pleasantly surprised as Hyde Park Towers was really a great place to stay made even better by the low room rate. As is frequently mentioned, the location is fantastic, near Hyde Park, close to tons of restaurants and in a very nice neighborhood, close to Portabello market and 2 underground stations. The reception area is professional and organized, and the hotel has modern credit card style keys (many budget hotels make you stop at the front desk to get your key which I HATE.) There's a nice bar area and an elevator to the 3rd floor where I stayed (I mostly walked the stairs but it was nice to have the elevator available). My rate came with the \"English Breakfast\" which was too heavy for me (bacon/eggs/etc), but I was content with the very nice buffet which was all I needed. The breakfast was really quite good, but crowded if you don't get there early. The room was small but adequate for me, plenty of room for my backpack and stuff. Nonetheless, if you are a very large person or need lots of space, this hotel might not be for you. As to noise, it's always a crapshoot anywhere you stay. In general people are polite and keep it down, but one evening a group was pretty loud/rude and you could for sure hear it, but for 2 other nights it was fine, no issues. I've experienced noisy neighbors at much better hotels for much higher rates so I can't fault the hotel. Oh yeah, you will hear the tube, but it wasn't an issue for me being on the 3rd floor, although it might be louder the closer you are to the ground. It certainly wasn't loud enough to wake me up.

As we are both young with a limited budget we thought we could grin and bear anything, but we really needn't have been so worried. Reception was immaculate and impressive looking. Helpful staff helped us check our luggage in, which was so handy as we had got the overnight bus down from Glasgow, and were able to get out and about for the day totally hassle free. The location of Hyde Park Towers was a very short walk from Bayswater Tube so we were able to travel into the centre of London so conveniently. When we checked in and got to our room, it seemed basic and clean - just what we needed really. The bathroom was however really tiny. Not enough room to get dried and ready in there after showering but there was a pc with internet access downstairs so we were able to just let each other have the room to themselves in order to get ready. Shower was very powerful, which was also a bonus. To be honest I've been put off booking in again due to the bathroom, but this is quite typical of everywhere in London, and for the money we paid we really couldn't argue.

The outside looks great, the reception is welcoming and the staff very friendly - it is the rooms that let this hotel down and that's what you are after all paying for - somewhere to sleep! (most people anyway). I was given a tiny single room at the side of the hotel (although I had paid for a twin) - the windows are old and very thin and the busy street outside was right next to the window. A couple decided to sit on the wall outside and start singing! (it sounded like they were in the room although there would not have been enough space for the 3 of us!) I asked at reception if they would ask them to move, they said it would be easier to offer me another room - 'OK'. Room 2 was at the back of the hotel, even smaller than the first and was unmade - towels on the floor, wet floor mat in the bathroom. I asked for another room... Room 3 - a twin room at last, but the door was ajar when I arrived and it wouldn't lock, again I complained - the receptionist was very helpful & courteous, but this does not help when there are so many problems. He came up to the room and the lock seemed to be working OK this time - then as we stepped into the room, the towels were on the floor, the bucket was full - I insisted the room had not been made and his answer was to get 'fresh' towels...by this time I was very tired and I needed sleep to get to an early conference the next day. I checked the door again and it was unlocked! A chair in front of the door and sleeping with one eye open (on what was as far as I knew unclean sheets) while listening to people having a bottle smashing competition outside is not condusive to a good nights sleep. Its a real shame as the hotel is easy to find and the staff seem very nice, if the rooms were better and the windows were double glazed this would be a far nicer place to stay. As I have no intention of going back - I don't feel like complaining as forums like this, especially if read by the Hotels in question may get things changed. Plus if people stop turning-up, they may start to question why?...the answer would be spend a night in one of the rooms for themselves! I would say on the plus side - the costs were inexpensive for the location, but there lies the catch (unlike the one on my room door).", "Date": "June 6, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Glasgow/London", "Title": "\u201cComfy Beds!\u201d", "Author": "chrishall", "ReviewID": "UR16464633", "Content": "I booked this hotel as I was planning a Theatre Trip with my girlfriend and wanted to cap the night off with a hotel stay.

The prices listed at the hotel at the time we checked in were more than double the price we paid online. My partner and I stayed here for a night after a long day in London. Having read previous reviews, I was slightly apprehensive about Hyde Park Towers. However, I tried to approach it with an open mind, and I was very pleasantly surprised! The first plus point is that it is just around the corner from the tube station so it is very convenient. The hotel from outside looks very well kept and reception was welcoming. Staff were very efficient to check us in and the girl who served us seemed friendly (a nice smile) but didn't attempt to make converstation (which was fine by me - I was really tired from the day and was impatient to get to my room in order to relax). Which comes to the room: we were allocated a room on the first floor. The view outside it was... nothing - just another building on the other side and some ventilation vents. (quite expected) Also the room was rather small - just enough for a double bed and some space around it. However, they managed to fit in a table with the TV, a desk by the bed and a wardrobe. I think given its size, they did the best they could. It was pleasant and all we needed. The bed was the highlight of the room - lovely soft cotton sheets and two fluffy pillows - the perfect remedy for my tired body after a day in London. Another thing I was pleased about was the bathroom - although very small (hard to fit two people in there) it was clean and there was a another highlight that I did not expect: a bathtub! The TV was tiny and the reception was not so great but not so bad that we couldn't watch it. Although there have been comments about feeling the underground, at the floor we were on, the vibrations were minimal and nothing that we couldn't sleep through. So I managed to get a good night's sleep. As for breakfast, I don't know what people were complaining about. There was a very good continental breakfast with a good selection of pastries, bread, jam, cereal, juices, fruit salad... I was very satisfied. Check out was just like check in, quick, efficient and problem free. One point that put me off a little about the hotel was the region it was in - although the road the hotel was on looked okay, I wasn't too comfortable walking around the areas closer to the station. (but this is someone who hardly is in big cities so I am biased and possibly more cautious than most!) I think that overall, this is a good place to stay if you need to stay a night in London. However, given the size of the room, I wouldn't recommend staying here more than a few days. I think it could get quite cramped, especially if you have a suitcase. So overall, the prices are very competitive online so I would definitely recommend to people on a tight buget and just needs a bed for the night :-)", "Date": "April 30, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "1", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Illinois", "Title": "\u201cDirty Rooms\u201d", "Author": "DM007", "ReviewID": "UR15460240", "Content": "We stayed at the Hyde Park Towers for 3 nights.

Me and my wife was placed in a tiny room in the basement, overlooking the \"courtyard\", that is, we look straight into the kitchen, which oozed of bacon and scramled eggs every morning from 5 am. The room itself was so small that it was ridiculous.There was actually not any place to lay down our big suitcase! We could tilt it standing, but had to lay onto the small (queen-size?) bed if we wanted to retrieve something from it. I had to remove a large fan from the floor and put it on top of a locker to get at least some space to move around the bed. But even then I would have to climb over my wife to get into my place in the bed. I even calculated the available floor space not occupied by desk, locker, fan, bed and door-swing. The available area was 1.5 square metres! For two persons. The bathroom was exactly the same as the ones you will find in a third class ship cabin: sooo small. We had orderd a non-smoking room, but the room was equipped with an ash tray, and the smell was undeniable. The safe was there, but not working. The tv didn't work either, but we was not in London to see tv so that didn't bother us too much. I was extremely disappointed to be offered this small room in the basement.

Luckily the double bed is just two twins pushed together so we managed to break them apart but that's not really the point. I had better things to do with my time. The room was rather small. The TV was rather big and had sky news and CNN along with with the 5 usual terestrial channels. The decor was shabby. It had clearly recently been painted but to a poor standard. The desk's seat was filthy. Goodness knows what all the stains were! The bathroom was a reasonable size and was quite clean apart from patches of mold on the ceiling. There was a bath and a shower. Even though we were on the second floor we could still hear and feel tube trains travelling underneath the hotel. I can only imagine how bad that must be if you're staying on the ground or 1st floor! The bar was small (a dozen seats and half a dozen tables) and overpriced. From memory a Smirnoff Ice cost \u00c2\u00a33, a small bottle of Guiness cost \u00c2\u00a33 and a very small bottle of coke (200ml) cost \u00c2\u00a31.40.

I have previously used [----] but am finding that its quality of service is diminishing. My main problem is that although the website states that there are rooms available, THREE TIMES I have been told that there was no availability and that they needed to find a replacement. The replacement hotels are usually not similar (based on reviews) to the one I initially book. Anyway it is a hassle to have to wait 2-3 days to see if the hotel accepts my booking. I used [----] for this booking and it went very well. We paid 59pounds for a one night stay for a double bedroom (without breakfast). The website only asks for your credit card information to hold the booking and we paid the full amount at the end of our stay at the hotel. We had a ground floor room which was fine. It WAS a tiny room, room enough for just 2 people sitting on the bed and watching TV, and 1-2 small bags. Think of a large walk-in closet and that is what we stayed in. The bathroom seemed bigger than the room itself. There was room to walk back and forth in and out of the bathroom. The room was clean, (including clean sheets and towels). The linens were pretty updated (I noticed a small stain on a towel, but it smelled washed). The TV set was TINY, but we weren't there to watch TV. The tub was a medium to small size but the shower curtain ROD ran along a bit too short, so if you shut the shower curtain all the way, you'd only have half of the tub to use. We just didn't shut the shower curtain all the way and we were fine, nothing got wet. Good updated faucets, good pressure in shower. It looks like they managed to update their sink faucet by combining the 2 spouts into 1, but I noticed they haven't quite got it perfected as I saw 2 different streams of water pouring out (one hot one cold) but out of one pipe. This didn't matter to us though, because you could wash your hands and face easily(just wait a couple seconds to let the 2 streams of water mix). They did not provide wash cloths which was a personal preference for my husband. Their shampoos were in small packets that you had to squeeze (so if you need lots of shampoo, bring your own), but they provide soap for the sink and the tub. They had a towel for the floor as well. I thought they did a great job with the space they had. They even had a nice size closet and desk with chair. We DID hear the subway train drive by every once in a while, but since we were back in at the hotel late at night we didn't hear it (and feel the rumbling) too often (I think the train stops running at a certain time). Neither myself nor my husband are light sleepers so it didn't bother our sleep. I'm not sure if you still hear and feel the train go by if you are on a higher floor. The location is the BEST part of this hotel. It is a block away from tons of shops, restaurants (all types, ethnic, etc), 2 underground stations. The area itself is very cute and quiet (in a small neighborhood). We would definitely come back here but only at a discounted rate. We saw that their regular rate was about 160pounds for a double room. Perhaps they reserve the ground floor rooms for the discounted rated rooms and the better/bigger rooms are upstairs??? There's no way I'd pay that much for the room we had. Reception at night was very friendly. The reception lady during the day seemed a bit moody that morning (Dec 2, 2006).

However, after staying there for a week from March 20 to March 27, 2006, I can say the location made this place along with the price. I booked a package through Orbitz so I really have no idea what exactly I paid for the hotel itself. Having said that, I noted behind the front desk on check-in that the price for a double was 160 British pounds for a double (approximately $260.00), which would have made this place very overpriced. I know we paid in the range of approximately $120.00 to $130.00 a night with our package. This is all speculation as I said we booked a package. First of all, thanks to TripAdvisor I knew a few things, such as to ask for a room on the second or third floor because of the fact the tube runs directly underneath the hotel. We could still hear the trains rumble on the third floor! Not a big deal, since it was very faint. However, staying on the first floor (second floor in England) would not have been good. The problem is that the tube line in this area is close to the surface of the ground, and thus the problem. The room (Room No. 317-non-smoking) was not as small as I expected, and after peaking into rooms being cleaned, can say that the rooms are New York hotel size. We had a room in the front. You cannot open the window as the noise from the street will keep you up all night. I assume it would be more quiet in the back with the windows open, but I would not count on that in this area of London. The room was clean and fresh towels every day. The bathroom was very small, even by New York standards. It was the length of a bathtub (a nice plus I thought) but the sink was on the left and the toilet on the right. Technically, you could brush your teeth while sitting on the toilet. But, to my surprise, there was plenty of that all important shelf space for your toothbrush, and pesonal toilet items. There was also a nice shelf for such items at one end of the bathtub. Although advertised as \"recently refurbished,\" I can say that this would be considered false advertising. Everything was very worn from the chairs in the so called \"bar\" to the sofas in the reception. The bar is only technically that. There were times late night that a few people gathered to have a drink and chat and have a night cap, but the person at the reception was the bartender. The floor behind the bar was filthy as I noticed when I actually went up to order a drink after summoning the night clerk a/k/a bartender. As for the free continental breakfast, I have had better. The croissants were OK, but there was little else. Bread was medicore, a few apples rounded out the buffet. A couple of mornings my husband and I decided to work a short block over to Starbucks and have real coffee and a roll at a nominal price. It was a short walk and convenient. Of course, the real reason for staying here had nothing to do with anything I just mentioned. It is location, location, location. Next to Bayswater Tube station, across from Hyde Park, walking distance of Kensington and Chelsea area, with great restaurants in the area, it was the location that brought people to stay here from all over the world (and the price). The hotel had been full every night for weeks (and in the off season)! Would I stay here again? Maybe, based on the price.

I'd definetly stay in Bayswater area again.", "Date": "March 5, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Udine", "Title": "\u201cgood deal\u201d", "Author": "Livia P", "ReviewID": "UR3703497", "Content": "I've stayed there for five nights. the room was small but we had clean towels everyday and the surroundings are nice. some pretty restaurants and two underground stations very close. Despite the fact that the underground line runs just under the building, you can live pretty comfortably. Paid 100 Euros per night for a twin room with bathroom...quite a good deal if you consider your very close to the centre. If I had to come back I would definitely choose it again.

First the good points. The rooms we had were small but clean. The beds were comfortable. We had a bath and TV. We were very close to the Bayswater tube station, and there were a lot of restaurants and stores within a couple of blocks. The problem was there is no air conditioning and it was quite warm while we were there. We had the windows wide open, and our room faced the street so we heard everyone who walked by, chatted, heard the garbage truck at 5 am. Then at 7am - and this was not the hotel's fault - the construction across the street began loudly. And due to jet lag we were having trouble with sleeping anyway, so the noise did NOT help.", "Date": "July 19, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "The Hague, Holland", "Title": "\u201cWorst hotel I've ever stayed in\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3545041", "Content": "When I checked into this hotel the first room they gave me was right off reception and I could hear every word that each guest was saying. There was very loud inappropriate music being played in the reception. The music poured into my room which I am convinced was an old utility closet because there were black oil stains all over the carpet, it was TINY and there was a very loud extraction fan outside the window. No light was coming in through the window so in the middle of the day my room was pitch black. When I asked to move, the lady said all they had left were rooms in the basement. I went to have a look and although it was quieter (apart from hearing the buzzing of the subway below) it certainly wasn't any cleaner. There were cigarette burns all over the blanket and the bathroom looked like it hadn't been properly cleaned in a while. There was also no light coming in from the window and the television didn't work. I took it anyway because I would rather stay in a dirty hotel room than an oil stained utility closet anyday.

However, when we arrived, we were pleasantly surprised: it was quite plush, the staff were helpful, the room was clean and even had a tv and a bath. Indeed, we spent at least 5 minutes congratulating ourselves on our good luck. This was a little pre-emptive however. As we stood there, a giant rumble violently shook the room, knocking our belongings off the bedside table. As we looked at each other, our minds initially filled with images of the tsunami which had struck the previous week. Returning to reality, we looked outside the window and realised our ground floor room had a view of the subway ventilation shaft; and that the giant rumble was not a dramatic one-off but an experience to be repeated approximately every three minutes. Needless to say, we did not get very much sleep. We were very glad we were only booked to stay one night at this hotel, as it would have ruined our stay in London. That said, apart from the shaking and rattling, this was an otherwise pleasant hotel, in a convienient location, with a hearty breakfast.", "Date": "March 1, 2005"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "The Hyde Park Towers Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g186338-d195207-Reviews-The_Hyde_Park_Towers_Hotel-London_England.html", "Price": "$94 - $141*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">41-51 Inverness Terrace</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">London</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">W2 3JN</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">England</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "195207", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/b0/08/b008c4da804cbbc884b2ac32cbb3482172large.jpg"}}
