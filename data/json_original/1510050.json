Our taxi driver couldnt give us change from a 100AED note (fresh from airport ATM) The cost was 45AED. The friendly night reception staff at the hotel kindly gave us change from their own pockets for the 100. We checked in and were shown to our room which smelt nice and was clean. The bed was very comfortable and it all looked nice and clean. The toilet had a bit of a smell (bad drains?)The bath was narrow but long. the tiles were mouldy and hadnt been fitted well onto the walls. The little kitchen was fantastic - so many cupboards and everything we needed. I took washing up liquid with me and a scrubber and dish cloth. they provided tea towels. The downside of the kitchen for me was the induction hob. I do not know how to cook on this and there were no instructions - I ruined our dinner one night and filled the room with a terrible smell of burning! The rooftop swimming pool was very busy as there were so many families staying there. Not enough sunbeds. The water was lovely - like a warm bath, but as the weather got cooler over the next week then the water was too cold for me to swim. No shelter from the strong wind on the roof. The view was pretty good up there. Wi-fi available in lobby can be very slow as this was a busy hotel. Theres a long couch and a 2 seater couch and 2 chairs for sitting on. There were always people sitting there. The lobby was like a train station with so many people walking past - take away and supermarket delivery men were forever going in and out as well as all the guests. We were supposed to have a newspaper delivered every day but only got one twice. It wasnt a problem as you could pick one up from the reception area. One day we only got one bath towel, another day no toiletries. The room was always cleaned well and I just phoned housekeeping when something had been forgotten. if we didnt leave our room early then the room wouldnt be made up until afternoon. On our last day we went out before 10am and when we went back in at 12 and then 2.30, the bed was stripped,sheets lying on the chair and the bed pulle out from the wall. We wanted to get on with our packing so i had to ask reception if they would get someone to finish the room. It was more than an hour before it was done. We had fallen asleep one night when the doorbell rang. A delivery man was at our door with bags. He insisted we had ordered something as he had the right room. maybe the wrong Winchester hotel!!!!! I was so annoyed - he ruined our sleep. Putting the do not disturb sign on means nothing! A couple of mornings we were woken at 7am with the cleaners chatting very loudly outside. The walls of the rooms are soundproofed but there is noise from the corridors that comes through the door. Some guests were very inconsiderate as they made so much noise on returning to their rooms late at night. For what we paid this hotel was ok, but just ok. We had stayed in the 4 points Downtown Sheraton on previous visits to Dubai which was far classier (and we paid a lot more) though the rooms were on a par. I wouldnt return to Winchester apartments. A taxi from airport to here - night rate - was AED45 and a taxi hailed from the road at hotel to take us back to airport cost us AED25 - also night rate -05.30am", "Date": "February 23, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bangalore, India", "Title": "\u201cNot a bad place for that price\u201d", "Author": "jswaminat", "ReviewID": "UR124965576", "Content": "the apartment is well furnished and spacious.

As I had a kitchen, I went down to the supermarket and bought items for breakfast rather than having their breakfast. John on reception is very helpful if you need anything. I didnt deal with anyone else. I found the private taxi drivers outside the hotel to be a ripoff. Suggest if you need a taxi, just get a normal one.

Upon arrival at the Reception desk a very unhelpful clerk named \"Parvez\" informed us that none of the 3 rooms/appartments were available as yet as hotel was fully booked and checkout time was 12 noon.... We asked if we could just at least have one of the rooms to relax and settle into until the other rooms were ready.... i mean what were we supposed to do for the next 5 hours!! This obnoxious man again replied \"sorry i cant do anything\". We asked him if we would be able to have breakfast as included in our booking, as we were not going to have breakfast on departing hotel due to our flight departure time....Again he replied \"No - not possible\"..... 10 - 15 mins later the manager a Mr John arrived.. he called us to the desk and apologised not all our rooms were ready as yet, then he advised he would Upgrade us to Appartment Suites if we would prefer and also we could go ahead and have breakfast as dining room was open from 7am... So it appears that \"Parvez\" was indeed lying to us when he informed Nothing Available! After that encounter everything was perfect.. the suites were very spacious and better than a home away from home.... really clean and great comfy big beds..Housekeeping daily... All the rest of the staff at the hotel really kind and cosiderate and very helpful and willing to help you with anything..... the breakfast selection good - cereals and juices and hot buffet food...toasting facilities...and also the chef will make eggs, omelettes etc and other simple requests.. The pool on the rooftop is very clean and a great view of Dubai skyline.. gym and steam / sauna facilities good. Overall we had a very enjoyable stay at this hotel,we booked various excursions from the hotel, also each time we asked the prices of anything to \"Parvez\" he always quoted us 100 dirhams extra than any of his colleagues - so do not ask him!

The breakfast was included which a lot of appts do not offer [self catering] The BF may not have everything to our taste but a simple egg and toast was good enough for us. There were some Indian dishes, yoghurt, eggs, mushrooms, beans, muffins etc. Over all we had a very comfortable and peaceful stay and would definitely stay again and recommend this to anyone. The Metro was a good 15 minutes walk which was no bother and you had 24 hours supermarket[spinney's] and Burjuman Mall at walking distance.

For 300dhms a night, I had a nice suite, but was upgraded last minute to a 2 bedroom apartment.. 2nd bedroom and bathroom I did not need nor use.. but the living room and kitchen with full refridgerator came in handy to save the beer and make chai in the morning.. Centrally located place in Mankhool.. Dubai Museum was walking distance.. nice shopping and plenty of restaurants/takeout places nearby.. (Lebanese and Indian/Pakistani) Took taxi to work, which was very convenient. Hotel staff very friendly.. Most of these kind of hotel/apartments in the area serve both business/vacation travellers and also host local families in the so called 'service' apartments concept. So it is very local, very family friendly and works for business travellers too.. you get a sense of the local life and culture.. 10 minute taxi drive to airport... For business travellers many restaurants/bars/nightlife near by. Note - Since this is an apartment, you have to remember to turn on the water heater a few minutes before you hit the shower.. I made the mistake of hitting shower like in a hotel and wondered why my first shower was so cold.. Worked fine the 2nd time once I turned on the heater. Oh.. free internet too.. Overall great place.. Would highly recommend for all.. THere were a few families with kids. Definitely going back to this place, and hopefully with my family next year..
