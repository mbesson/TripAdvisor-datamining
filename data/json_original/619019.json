The rooms are dirty and smell like bunch of people smoking in there. The bathroom are very small and not clean. The hotel has some weird policy like no AC which means no cool air coming out of the vent in November, therefore, it's very hot in the room to sleep. There is a temparature control unit in the room but you can't change the temparature, then why install the unit? The staff do not speak good English, so it's very hard to communicate. The housekeeping staff are not trained correctly how to clean the room, for the four days that I stayed there, the only thing they do is to make the bed, I could do that myself. I don't recommend anyone stay at this hotel, it's one from hell.", "Date": "Nov 12, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR741789181", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "yhh"}, {"Content": "Best location and value I have found in Beijing I cannot be more clear, this is one of the best value hotels I have stayed at in China and I am there a lot. Not quite four star but well beyond a three star. The location could not be better, easy walk to Tianemen Square, Forbidden City ,Wanfujing Street and you quite literally can throw a rock at the night market. Paid $48 through Ctrip for a windowless single, which I really prefer because it lets me ignore what time it is outside if I want to nap [jet lag hint].", "Date": "Oct 30, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR174095802", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "jeffreyfellman"}, {"Content": "good value in Wangfujing area I stayed here last week and agree with most of the other comments posted below. I have been to Beijing many times and stayed in places ranging from hostels to five stars. Once found, the hotel is very centrally located. To find it I looked on elong.net (but booked through Ctrip). and found a map (in Chinese) memorised general location and went from there. I took a room with no window (388 rmb per night, inc breakfast) which was fine, spacious, bathroom ok (shower better than mine at home so always a good sign!), a few stains on carpet, safe, hbo,and free internet. Very friendly staff but no other interaction other than check in and out and carrying baggage. Breakfast in the lobby is a good deal with a range to suit everybody. Whilst the world doesn't (shouldn't ?) rotate around Wanfujing Street, the location is good, making it a good choice in this area. Out of the hotel , turning right is the food street, Wanfujing shopping street runs parallel to the hotel, Beijing Art Museum (fabulous) is a short walk north, Tian'anmen Square and Gugong (Forbidden City) east wards. Subway/Metro/Underground in at the bottom of Wangfujing, (15 minutes walk ?, south) and is handy to catch the airport bus transfer from/to Xidan.A good find .", "Date": "Dec 4, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR472433023", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "johnniew"}, {"Content": "Excellent Hotel....Almost 5 Star Hotel Excellent hotel..excellent service...you feel like home.

Nanjing Great Hotel was an excellent choice.It is not a very popular hotel as it was not on my tourist map of hotels, the only difficult was finding it. Once I did find it the location was SUPERB as good or if not better than 5star hotels in Beijing. Its near Wangfujing shopping street (Beijings main street) 200m away, 500m to Forbiden City, 1000m from Tianmen Square... and lots others.Room was budget no window but it was great. Very modern in room and throughout hotel. Lots of marble and plush carpets, very clean and helpfull staff. Easily 4stars.Breakfast was included. And it was great, mix of western and chinese... great sampler. English signs and speaking staff everywhere.No worries... I will stay again at only 45USD per night, can not go wrong. Sure its not 5star, but im not staying in hotel 24/7.

Booked through Sinohotel Reservations (--- also offers similar rates). Location is its biggest plus. Hotel is very close to the Wangfujing shopping area and Dong Hua Men night market/food street (couple minutes walk). Very good breakfast. Hotel staff spoke very minimal English. Booking of our Acrobatics show was problematic (instead of taking us to our requested show, they dropped us off at one of their affiliated theatres). Electronic safe in the room. Some rooms had climate control issue (was very warm). Strange smell in the elevators.
