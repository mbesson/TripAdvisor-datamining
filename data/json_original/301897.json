The location is great for shopping, the staff are genuinely happy to see you and do their utmost to have your every whim looked after. And the nicest thing was I didn't feel like a walking dollar sign with everyone putting their hand out. The room was comfortable and I didn't hear any noise from the rooms next door and the breakfast was particularly good, the choices lovely and fresh and perfectly cooked, the strawberry jam home-made with whole strawberries in it - which I haven't seen since I made it myself! Two pools to choose from, we used the pool at the spa area, no-one else there (except staff) and was lovely. The only thing this hotel doesn't have is a beach.

Our stay here was his treat to us. And we were so glad to have had the opportunity. From the moment you step out of your transport to the time you step back in it to leave, this hotel just wraps you up in itself and treats you like the most important guest in the world. We got out of the transport from airport and was greeted by name from that point on - everywhere by everyone. And the hotel did have a few guests staying. Quick check in and bonus upgrade to a room with a view on a quiet floor. Room is a little bit worn, but spotlessly clean and so very welcoming. Renovations and upgrades are underway but totally unobtrusive. My only negative comment and this is only subjective - is that the bed was too soft and rolling over was a bit of an effort. I should have asked for the mattress topper to be removed and this would have probably made a difference - but I did not think of it. The two pools are lovely and quiet. But towels, fresh fruit and cold water were always offered to us. The mall between Four Seasons and Hilton makes a lovely (airconditioned:) walk to Orchard Road - where everything is at your fingertips. Cannot comment on the restaurant facilities as the delights of Singapore outside were too tempting to resit. However the cocktail bar always appeared lively and afternoon tea seemed to be very popular. I loved this hotel so much, that I will break open the money box and pay to stay here rather than our usual budget hotels.

I haven\u2019t reviewed this hotel yet mainly because I could not find any faults the last time, and to be honest all my negatives here are really just nitpickings. Located smack-dab in central Orchard road, a stone\u2019s throw from the gigantic Ion shopping mall as well as other shopping and eating venues, the hotel is definitely convenient. Lovely rooms, incredible service and good facilities ensure that I will be returning soon. +++: Rooms: The rooms I have stayed in are fairly simple, with no fancy gadgets or overly opulent decorations, but it just feels right. To put it simply, it feels like home. Nicely sized bathrooms with separate shower/bathtub, dressing table, work table, a small couch to relax on and a decently sized TV \u2013 everything just works together terrifically. If I sound too effusive I apologize, but I just really like the rooms at this hotel. Location: I have stayed at a few other hotels for work and play, and this one takes the cake for both. It is centrally located in Orchard Road, and taxis are usually available outside to take you anywhere. Service: Exemplary Four Seasons service. From check-in to getting on my taxi to the airport, staff went out of their way to ensure that I was taken care off. I owe the valets outside a very sincere thank you for helping me with my luggage after a slight hiccup involving rotting fruit. ---: Wear and tear: As I said before, I truly am nitpicking a little here, but some parts of the room seemed in need of a little pick-me-up. The rooms do not look tired by any measure, but sections here and there (especially in the bathroom) looked like they need a tiny bit of a refresh. Spa facilities: All guests are welcome to use the \u201cclub\u201d facilities on a lower floor. This includes a pool, outdoor Jacuzzi, common area with free tea and the gym. I have to say however, that the Jacuzzi was thoroughly underwhelming. It overlooks another building through a steel gate, and the temperature was a little low.

We stayed for two nights just before Christmas and one night just after the New Year. We booked a deluxe room for the two nights in December and a superior room the one night in January. Both times we were put in identical rooms on the 11th floor, which is a \"couples floor\". The main advantage for us was free internet, which the Four Seasons usually charges for. They also brought little desserts to our room each afternoon and had canapes out most of the day on a credenza near the elevators. The rooms on this floor have loads of extra throw pillows on the bed/chair, have 4 M&M canisters full of free candy, and have photos of \"romantic\" things like wedding rings scattered about as well as books of love poems and such. The room was generally tasteful but a bit too traditional for me. Even with the extra throw pillows it was bland and too beige. The four M&M canisters in bright primary colors stuck out glaringly (and, I have to say, rather crassly) as the only real color in the room. (Although I did happily eat the free M&Ms and Jelly Bellys). And the romantic photos and stuff were a bit too much for me \u2013 a little tacky. I wish the FS Singapore had followed the example of the FS Bangkok, with sleeker Asian-influenced decor. The rooms in Bangkok have lovely pops of color, with silk throws and pillows on the beds and Thai murals over them. And the rooms at the Mandarin Oriental in Singapore are similar to the FS Bangkok. The bathroom - also beige, of course \u2013 was large and had a big soaking tub and a shower with great water pressure. No complaints there. We had a city view from our room but it wasn't of anything that would wow you. The fitness center is on par the better ones we've generally found in hotels, and should meet most people's needs. I had a massage at the spa and it was lovely and relaxing. The lobby isn't terribly distinctive, but it is elegant and quiet, with a couple of little sitting rooms tucked away, as well as two restaurants, a bar, and a small shop. The Christmas decorations were attractive and festive. Our package included the buffet breakfast, which is delicious and offers a nice selection. The Four Seasons is half the size of the Mandarin Oriental, and you feel this at breakfast for sure \u2013 the restaurant is much smaller, quiet, and relaxed \u2013 you won't get lost trying to find your way back to your table from the buffet, like at the MO. Service is, not surprisingly, excellent. The staff knew our names from the first minute. Everyone went out of their way to be helpful. All requests (dinner reservations, directions, coffee in the middle of the night, etc) were handled quickly and efficiently. We were impressed that they sent our laundry to a same-day outside service that charged a very reasonable rate vs. the typical practice of charging a small fortune for per-piece in-house laundry service. Overall the Four Seasons is a lovely hotel with wonderful service. I highly recommend it if you prefer a smaller, more intimate hotel and/or if you want to be on Orchard Road. But overall I did prefer the more modern, colorful, Asian-inspired room decor at the Mandarin Oriental, and the harbor/skyline views from the MO are spectacular. I also like the location of the MO just as much as the FS.

The room I got was large and had all the ammenities that one would typically expect from a luxury hotel of this standard. The difference I thought was in smaller details that make luxury hotels different- service - disappointing accross house keeping room service, restaurants and the club. Room service phone lines never got answered - the calls were alwas answered by the operator after a number of rings who took a minute or two to find someone in room service before my order could be taken. This happened all of the 5 times I called room service. I also struggled to get room service to take back teh trays after I finsihed my meals. Two of the three occassions I had to carry the tray out myself while the third time breakfast tray was removed by the person who carried my lunch (lunch tray I carried out of the room myself). House keeping was ok but not the usual \"feel good\" when I got back to the room in the evening. Other smaller deatils - newspapers are provided on request (I requested 4 times a day for the 3 days I was there but dint get one in my room), toilet ammenities are high quality but limited for a hotel of this kind. Telephone chargers - they have only one machine that charges batteries only - so one needs to take the battery out of the phone walk down to the lobby and hand it over and so on.

But since we just returned from another holiday in Singapore (its Grand Hyatt this recent trip), its more relevant now to compare Four Seasons Singapore than before. First off, most guests would come to expect top notch service and accommodation when selecting a Four Seasons - partly due to its reputation and the going premium rate per room night that undermines even other 5 star hotels. I tried hard yet failed to notice any significant aspect of this hotel that supposed to make it a great hotel. Location wise, its OK if you don't mind 10mins walk each time you wish to go out but with the closure of Borders @ Wheelock Place, its beginning to make the stroll to closest mall or Orchard MRT station feel even further. The Deluxe room we stayed is of average size. Its L'Occitane amenities are same as whats provided by other hotels (ie: Shangri-la Bangkok). Due to the architectural layout of the building, most rooms have odd angular corridor and bathroom thats not only resulting in waste of space but also creates an claustrophobic feel. The level of service is perhaps the most jarring disappointment. Nevermind that the staffs can't even address in-house guests by their name (ie : Aman resorts), they are simply nothing much to shout about. Throughout the 3 days, not a single employee stood out or left a lasting impression that I can recall even after checking out. All said, the Four Seasons Singapore does have something interesting. Its that the Pool floors looks so dated its quickly take you back to the eighties like a time machine! So retro you should borrow your parents clothes to feel properly dressed. So pools need to be upgraded and surrounding also wouldn't mind a facelift. I wish I could have had a more exciting stay at the Four Seasons. My only consolation was that I enjoyed every minute of my time there only because of the company of my wife. If I have to pay that sort of money again, I would have done it just like how we spent our weekend in Singapore last week.

Almost like they could predict your every need. After 10 days in India this was the perfect place to decompress and readjust to the modern world for 3 days. Right off of the main luxury shopping street of Orchard Rd, easy cab rights elsewhere. The spa was the best we've been at, and I highly recommend the Balinese massage, especially if you can get Kiki.

Breakfast was excellent, service good, newspapers available in quantity, I had a small snack at the bar and it was excellent.

The breakfast was also exceptional with a wide range of hot and cold food, fruits, pastries, asian cuisine, western cuisine, smoothies, juices etc. I only had one gripe with our room (1107), it had a very slight ringing noise in the bedroom, like a noisy water pipe, but it was only very slight. I can honestly say that the service in this hotel is one of the best I have experienced and will definitely stay here when visiting Singapore next time. 5 stars from us!", "Date": "July 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Perth, Australia", "Title": "\u201cGreat four season service\u201d", "Author": "255103Robert", "ReviewID": "UR116024831", "Content": "My wife and i stayed overnight on the way to europe.

But this stay was not particularly impressive, and it did not meet my own personal expectation for a 4S. Personally, a calmed, cooled room with fine linen, along with a marble facaded bathroom is basic for a 4S; customized services to enrich a business travel is what I look forward from 4S. Certain portion of the staff appeared to be not well-motivated, and a few staffers to me did not even receive enough training, especially the concierge and the porters. They gave me the typical SG zombie look. Uninspiring interior and breakfasts. And the last thing to whine a bit, the bathtub was not really that clean.... A wonderful business hotel, but definitely not a remarkable 4S. Pros: 1. Pre-arrival telephone confirmation, as I was informed later on check-in that the particular phone call was made by the GM. All the details had been proceeded by the international reservation center were reconfirmed. 2. Efficient check-in counter, of course, this is a 4S 3. Superb rain forest and the tub could be filled up within 5 mins 4. Efficient house keeping service, the 2 dental kits requested were delivered within secs. Amazing. 5. The fine and soft summer bathrobe. Perfect for the tropical climate. 6. Great courtesy from the sweet blond lady at the counter, your great smile was a huge plus and did soothe the tiredness of traveling. 7. Supply of bottle water! A nice touch. Cons: 1. The doormen were a bit absent minded. Upon our arrival, they did not assist much and failed to greet at the very first place. This was much different from my experience with other Fourseaons. 2. The duty staffers of the concierge were somehow lukewarm. I wonder whether this is part of the SG characteristic. They did provide the information that was inquired though; still, I felt as if I were not a guest but an errant someone. 3. The breakfast was truly uninspiring. Some of the typical 4S consideration were missing; no stir long spoon for freshy watermelon and honey-du melon juice. The result was the sediment/flesh poped out entirely over my hands. And some of the staffers were intrusive, without grace. 4. The reinovated interior decor of the deluxe twin I stayed reminds me of the 4S Macau. The same wall paper at least... The BATHTUB was not \"spotless\" Unfortunately, I left with the impression that some of the staffers are not well-motivated, and some are not even professionally trained, according to my understanding of what sort of service a 4S should be capable of. It is less likely that I will return.

However the staff bent over backwards to find us a room and after a delightful pot of tea in the club area, we were in our room before lunch. It was great. We ate in the One-Ninety restaurant three times and each time it was better than the time before. One of those times was to experience the Sunday Champagne brunch and once again, it exceeded all of my expectations, and I have eaten Champagne brunches all over the world. The selection of food was second to none, from sushi, to dim sum, to a live cooking station which included foie gras and lobster, it was a banquet from start to finish. Another lady customer told me that it was truly the best Sunday brunch in all of Singapore and I believed her. Particularly the dessert table. And my mother and I certainly did the whole thing justice! It is almost worth flying back to Singapore for this brunch alone! All other aspects of our stay went swimmingly. I had additional luggage that I considered shipping by DHL and the concierge was most helpful finding out the procedure and likely cost. I ended up taking my chances with the airline at the end, but I truly appreciated the help from the concierge. The gym was extremely well laid out and was empty on every occasion I used it, which I enjoyed, as was the pool nearby.

There was also a dvd player in the room (I think you could also borrow dvds to but we didn\u2019t get a chance to check this out). Internet: 30 minutes free service at the Business Centre! Staff: very, very helpful, friendly from ground level to the hotel manager (who we were fortunately able to meet) Location: very conveniently close to Orchard MRT station.

This is a decent hotel in the 5 star category and can compete with the international peers generally. The location in Singapore is perfect if you are coming to shop or for sightseeing - Orchard Rd is just a stone throw away, yet the hotel is in a quiet enough location. If you are coming for business and happen to have to go rather towards Raffles Place, then you will have to allow for a c. 20 minute taxi journey. At first arrival the appearance of the hotel was very pleasant - a high quality lobby and an appearance of value - as you would expect it. However, digging deeper, it was very obvious that the hotel was well past its peak. Service quality throughout the hotel was medium at best - from the doorman, through reception and particularly the restaurant. Staff made the simplest task appear tedius and cumbersom. The told you they are \"happy to help\", but actions spoke of the opposite. The restaurant was particularly bed. The food quality was okay, but again it took the waiters forever to bring the menu and take the order. I dined there twice and it took the best part of half an hour until someone had actually written down the order - even though the there were only a handful tables taken. Loads of waiters walking around, but they seemed to busy themselves with carrying individual forks from table to table rather than serving guests. During breakfast, the restaurant was clearly too small to cater for the guests. Most mornings I had to take a seat at the nearby bar and carry the food across the hall. Same incompetence as during dinner. Several people would ask 3-5 times for the room number. F&B management does clearly not assign roles and responsibilities. The atmophere in the morning was very busy and noisy. Felt more like sitting at Delhi train station rather than a 5 star hotel. The rooms are clean, but could do with renovation. They look tired, very 1980s. I left the hotel early and moved to a different one once my prime choice became available.

In that mall you have Borders and Marks and Spencers, the Apple store etc. You can walk along through three or four malls from Wheelock Place, all in air conditioning and also the Orchard, underground train stop is only 5 minutes away once you get into Wheelock Place mall.

I went for breakfast at the \"Club\" - a very limited buffet that I am amazed the FS would put its name to. It reminded me of a B&B I once stayed in near Heathrow. Very tired and very sad. A sign above it said it was $38++ per person, presumably to alert other \"Club\" guests like me that it was not complimentary, as \"Club\" breakfasts usually are. This is a standard price - and a fair price - for the full buffet one might expect at any 5 star hotel restaurant - but not for an old piece of fruit and a selection of Danish that could have been used to wedge a wobbly table.

Try and get the breakfast included with your room rate as it is too expensive (again, nothing surprising given 5* but there is much better value in nearby food courts). The location is excellent, quiet, yet just 100 metres from Orchard Rd; and from the nearby Borders book shop entrance you can walk for miles underground through shopping centres and to the trains, thus avoiding the heat of Singapore. Another plus is that Four Seasons tends to have less of the boisterous tourist/ex-pat crowd we observed at the Hyatt, Marriott and Hilton. As you'd expect, this is hardly a cheap hotel, but if it was only 10%-15% more than anything nearby it would always be our first choice.

Hotel is a bit tired, inside and outside. Rooms are nicely furnished but nothing out of the extraordinarily. First of all, the room key also operates as an elevator key. We travelled with about 40 family members to attend a wedding so we needed to go from floor to floor to visit. Sometimes the key allows you to go to another floor, sometimes it does not. Which can be frustrating at times. Check in was very slow - took about 15 minutes to complete registration for one room. Internet connection in room costs an arm and a leg. No Wifi at lobby so there is not really an alternative. Bathroom is spacious. Other than that, nothing special to note, except you cannot leave a towel mat on the floor outside the shower cubicle, it will be swept across the floor when you open door. So you need to open door after your shower, grab the towel from the rack above the bathtub, put it on the floor and then step out of shower. Not the best arrangement. On our first morning there, our room was made up at around 9:30am. Second morning we came back at noon and it was still not done.

It was almost lumpy and must have taken a lot of very heavy people because on either side, the mattress tended to slope towards the end. This meant that every so often I woke up feeling i was sliding off and had to move really close to the centre. So with my husband having to do the same both of us were squeezed well into the centre - quite cosy actually except for the fact that we had to wake up often to get back into that position. My daughter who had another room on the same floor also complained about this. But - because the hotel is the nicest place to be in we didnt complain so much about this problem. We just tolerated it although this really means the next time I would not be so sure about booking into the hotel.

FS Hong Kong was an absolutely perfect hotel experience and truly blew us away so I suspect that may be part of why we found the Singapore FS a wee bit disappointing. We booked and received a Premier Room which is located on the corner of the building and is slightly larger that the lower category rooms and has wrap around windows. The room looked as though it needed some upgrading and had a faint musty smell. Staff were all very nice and the doormen made special effort to learn both mine and my partners names and great us warmly every time we came and went. Location is steps from Orchard Blvd which is amazing for shopping and the city centre is only 10 minutes by taxi. One thing that detracted from our stay was the amount of old room service tables and garbage in the hallways on our floor. I don't blame the hotel for this entirely as we had some very unsavory guests on our floor who would just throw their garbage into the hall, but it did seem like the garbage sat there a long time before someone noticed it to clear it away. Same with room service tables sitting in the hallway. Also, my partner and I are non-smokers and cannot stand the smell of smoke and always book non-smoking rooms, unfortunately the same people who threw their garbage into the hall smoked like chimneys on our non-smoking floor and you could smell it in our room. To the hotels credit, after we complained, an employee came up to try stop the smoking and had a rather heated confrontation with the \"unsavory\" guests but they refused to stop smoking unless they could get a group of rooms together on the smoking floor together, which was not available, so they continued puffing away. The hotel handled the situation as best they could and offered to move us to another room but we were ready to retire to bed for an early morning flight and refused the transfer. The hotel did offer a partial credit for that last night which was a nice gesture. We had breakfast in the hotel each morning and it was delicious with a large selection of buffet items, western, Chinese and Japanese and an egg station were you could get your eggs cooked to order. We also had lunch at Jiang-Nan Chun on the 2nd floor and it was delicious.

I found it a bit to soft, and as my boyfriend and I are not that slim, we had trouble sleeping. The Chinese restaurant upstairs is top notch on most dishes. The one downstairs was pretty good too. And if you want a change of diet, they know how to make a pizza. Our only other good food experience in Singapore was near Middle Road, Bain street and the hamburger place 3B at Cineleisure Orchard. The latter was pretty cool, because we were definitely the oldest people in the mall. Fun to see how the young in Singapore enjoy themselves. And if you can eat a surprisingly well and honestly made hamburger at the same time, well ... An excruciatingly bad experience however was One on the Bund. Unless you want to spend a lot of money on a good view, don't go there! Staff who don't know what they're doing, crab rolls straight from the freezer without the crab, rubber calamari and a Michelin star pretence and arrogance from the manager to go with it. Personally I found Singapore on the whole to focus a lot on the outside, which explains the zillions of shoppingmalls and the pretty food courts with bad food. By the way, prices are lower in Paris than in Singapore in the big Sale. Locationwise, the hotel is right at the start of all the shopping malls. The subway works perfectly and is close by. Chinatown is awfully touristy and I don't believe any Chinese actually live there anymore so to speak. The Art museum and also their kids department had some great exhibitions on. We didn't expect this, but it's a city easily done on foot. A couple of hours will get you very far.

The reception works efficiently when checking you in, I don't like waiting too long to get into my room. 2. Room The size is pretty good for Singapore hotel standard, toiletries are from L'Occitane. Lighting wise is not pretty bright, I like brighter room with a dimmer option. Bedding is a little too soft for me, I would prefer harder mattress. I know you can request this from them beforehand, but I forgot to ask. They provide complimentary 2 drinking water bottle, but for the price they are charging I think they should provide a better brand one, not just cheap water bottle. It kinda downgrade the look of the room. 3. Breakfast Generally it's good, but my complaint only the croissant is never fresh and crispy, a bit too oily and no flakes at all. Selection wise is also limited but still acceptable. 4. Gym and Pool It's sufficient, I didn't use the facilities, but I went there and took a look.

With bell captains and receptionists alike remembering your name and happily answering to your every beck and call. Afterall, this is a Four Seasons.

Nothing is too difficult or complex for this staff - Pool at the top of the building is pleasant with pool staff attentive to your every need. - Free Parking for guests under the hotel - Big bathrooms with shower, bath and twin sinks. Plenty of high quality toiletries and soft towels. - Nice big comfy king bed, although pillow quality was average. - Housekeeping was top notch, keeping our room neat and tidy and restocked every day. Negatives : - \"You're charging how much for eggs on toast ???\" Seriously, I know it's hotel prices but breakfast pricing was ridiculous. If there weren't so many business travelers there, the breakfast restaurant would be empty. - We got a cot in our room for our 2yr old. It looked like they bought it from a hospital in the 70's. Suffice to say our kid didn't find it enticing at all. The next night we swapped to a spare bed which was a much better outcome for us. - Still no free WIFI in the public spaces. Why or why do international hotel brands still not understand this is a massive oversight ?? Top tips from when we stayed : - A short walk down Orchard Boulevard and you get to Wheelock Place (shopping mall/office tower). Going underground from there takes you as far as Takashimiya (a much bigger shopping mall/office tower). So just keep exploring. - On the way, ION foodcourt has great local fare at very reasonable prices. Go there for your cheap and cheerful meals. - If you get a car, be sure to park for free under the hotel with exit tickets from the concierge.", "Date": "June 13, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bangkok", "Title": "\u201cMany service lapses for a 5 Star Hotel.

Also, don't be surprised if you run in to the prime minister of some country if you stay here! I know I did! I ran in to the Kenyan Prime Minister and his escort who were staying at The Four Seasons coinciding with my stay. Minor inconveniences due to increased security but wickedly cool to know you're staying where heads of state do. The gym is particularly lovely, clean and well equipped for the size of the hotel. Buffet breakfast is also great with superb service from the lovely and smiling attendant who also doubles as the gym attendant in slower times. The management is also very professional and courteous. Bell Hops and the bell Captains are all helpful and dedicated. On one particular night the Bell Captain managed to find my friend's phone that was left behind in the cab as I was exiting! Location is a tiny bit out of the way, however it does afford privacy and quietness. It is about a 3 minutes walk away from Orchard Road, multiple malls (Ion, Wheelock etc) and the MRT station. Overall can't rave enough about this place. A delight to be their guest.

We stayed in a one-bedroom suite which worked quite well with the kids; king sized master with a gorgeous bathroom and two beds in the living room with another bathroom. We were able to take advantage of a special and received the 3rd night free (which made it more affordable to stay here). My 6-year old and I had a tough time with jet lag our first night. Finally, at 5 am I asked her if she wanted to go to the pool. We had a wonderful morning swim at the roof top pool and ordered room service breakfast. Brooklyn thought it was fabulous. The pool staff are attentive and kind. You are given cool towels, a water spritzer, ice water and a little snack of fresh fruit. If anyone stays here - could you send me a pic of the fresh fruit basket in the room and/or of the tray at the pool? My daughter is doing a photo book and wished she had one. Although it was very hot in Singapore, there seemed to be a cool rain every afternoon. We really enjoyed swimming in the rain or relaxing in the hot tub. There are many good restaurants close by and we took the subway quite a bit. The hotel also arranged for a minivan to transport us to several different locations. I'd highly recommend the breakfast with the orangutans at the Singapore Zoo. I was tempted to skip the zoo because we had been to the San Diego Zoo a few months earlier - don't skip this zoo. It really is different and well worth the trip. Excellent fitness center but very HOT! Generally the air conditioning was fine throughout the hotel but the fitness center was steaming. Extremely comfortable beds; fresh fruit basket every day. Spa was lovely; my husband enjoyed his massage and I enjoyed the reflexology. The Christmas lights in the Orchard Road area where out of control and fun to see. If you are connecting in Japan from the states, I'd highly recommend the 12 hour layover and seeing Narita.

They are having promotion for weekend stay which is much lower than their normal rates. Besides, the Four Seasons in Hong Kong is my all-time favorite hotel. I reckon that even if the Four Seasons Singapore is half as good as their sister hotel in Hong Kong ( and their rate is less than half as much ), it will be a satisfactory stay at least. Arriving I took a cab to the hotel and upon arrival, the bellboy took care of my luggage in a speedy manner. I was lead to the reception desk for check-in. There\u2019s no queue so I don\u2019t need to wait and a polite female staff checked me in. I wrote in advance to the hotel that I wanted a quiet room and was assured the suite assigned to me will be quiet although it is not the corner suite that I wanted. Now start the first hiccup in service. Because my flight the next day is at midnight, I requested for a late checkout, up to 6PM if possible. Immediately, the answer was a firm NO. \u201cWe are fully booked sir\u201d, so I was told. I then explained that I got a midnight flight the next day and it will be too early if I have to check out at 12 noon which is the official check-out time. Being familiar with Four Seasons service, I was expecting some consideration and flexibility. Again, the answer is NO and instead, she offered me a half-day stay at a Deluxe room at S$180++ instead which I turned it down. She then gave me the keys and show me the lift to my room. No escort to room. Not that I was expecting it but I\u2019m a First time guest at the Four Seasons Singapore and a suite room guest for that matter, I was expecting a better welcome, ie a Four Seasons welcome. Not contended with being denied my late check-out, I checked the availability of the one-bedroom suite on the hotel\u2019s website and found that they are still available. So how can it be \u201cfully booked\u201d? I finally have to call their Guest Relationship Manager and after some haggling, I managed to get a late check-out up to 3PM. OK, good enough but still I can sense their reluctance in doing so. Obviously, the hotel was expecting some last minute booking and was unwilling to extend any late check-out for me even though the suite is technically available. That\u2019s very un-Four Seasons like. The Room Fortunately, it didn\u2019t go further downhill from here. The suite is a expansive one bedroom suite with separate living area and bedroom measuring a spacious 91m2 . First impression was that the suite was rather dark and lack natural lighting. Then the d\u00e9cor is classical and on first impression seems to lack the wow factor of say the Four Seasons in Hong Kong or the St Regis just a few blocks down the road. However, closer inspection shows that the room was furnished very elegantly and all furniture and fittings are of high quality, and kept sparkling new. A long foyer leads to the plesant living room that has a comfortable sofa seat and a dinning table for four. There\u2019s a welcome fruit plate. For entertainment, the suite comes with a 42\u201d Sharp Aquos LCD TV and DVD player. On-desk connection allows for connection of laptop and MP3 player. A pleasant surprise greets me when I enter the bedroom. It features the same extremely comfortable bed used in the Four Seasons Hong Kong, with exactly the same mattress and linens and actually feels a bit larger. It\u2019s simply divine and provide me with a great night sleep. The bathroom is a full ensuite with dual sinks but the fittings are old-style contemporary. Still it looks brand new and water pressure is good which is most important. Toiletries could be better though as the hotel only provide small size L\u2019Occitane. The bathrobes are soft and fluffy. Overall, the suite is elegant and tastefully decorated, with a timeless feel to it. It grows on me the longer I stayed in this suite. Everything feels so comfortable and in their proper place. Common Areas The Four Seasons Singapore is not a large 5-star hotel physically like the Ritz or the Mandarin. While it has 255 guest rooms, the hotel has a very boutique feel to it. It also doesn\u2019t have the soaring atrium of the Four Seasons Hong Kong. Exploring more though and one can easily find delightful areas for relexation. There is this particular study and sitting area that is just next to the reception which is decorated in a timeless elegant manner. It\u2019s very relaxing to stay there and just read a book or magazine. Other areas of the hotel are just as nicely furnished and decorated. Oriental and modern artwork decorated most of the common areas of the hotel. I only visited the One-Ninety Restaurant for breakfast and the d\u00e9cor is a bit too dark and gloomy for my taste. Breakfast is just so-so with garden varieties breakfast items, ie. Cereals, eggs etc. The orange juice was great and so is the coffee. I was surprised to read that the price of the breakfast cost S$48 per pax. Fortunately, it\u2019s included in my room rate. I also visited the gym which is well equipped. The hotel despite its size have two swimming pools, one next to the gym at the 3rd floor and one at the roof top with a view of orchard road. In terms of design and d\u00e9cor, the Four Seasons Singapore reminds me of the Oriental in Bangkok which is steep in tradition, yet elegant and timeless. Nowadays, new hotels always go for the modern contemporary design that appears almost like cookie-cutter designs from the same mold. The Four Seasons is a nice change. Service Other than the initial check-in hiccups, I really find it difficult to find any fault with the service. Staff are consistently polite and friendly and always asked if they can be of any assistance. And they are quick to response to any service call in a willing and gracious manner. I was often greeted by name and service with a smile. This is typically Four Seasons service at it\u2019s very best, surpassing even the services at St Regis. It\u2019s still not quite as excellent as those in Four Seasons Hong Kong but close enough. For those that are looking for a pampering experience, there are few options in Singapore as good as this hotel. One special mention is that the Housekeeping staff in Four Seasons are truly first class. I don\u2019t interact much with them but just looking at my suite\u2019s condition, I know they did an excellent job. Just like their counterpart in Hong Kong, I\u2019m not sure how they do it but everything is always kept sparkling and clean. It\u2019s so meticulous that I find it difficult to spot dust in my suite, not to mention dirt of any kind. True luxury is to indulge oneself in an environment as pleasant as this. Conclusion The 3rd Four Seasons I have tried proof to be a great value and with excellent potential. My fondness for this chain grows and I\u2019m now looking forward to trying out a 4th Four Seasons. True, the suite is not as \u201cexciting\u201d as the Executive Suite I tried in Four Seasons Hong Kong, but so is the price which is less than half. And the service is close, if not for the hiccup on check-in, I would have given it my rare 5/5.

We weren\u2019t disappointed. After an easy check-in, where we were given a room upgrade without even asking, my husband took a nap while I went to the 20th floor roof-top pool. The sweet pool attendant made up a lounger for me with plush towels, and then brought me a tray with a cool cloth, a bowl of fresh watermelon chunks and a small mister bottle for my face. I watched the sun go down from the lounger. I returned to our large, tastefully decorated room to prepare for dinner. My husband woke up with a headache, and the concierge promptly sent us a packet of panadol from the gift shop. After returning from dinner, we wanted to have the birthday cake I ordered the day before delivered poolside, but it was after 10 p.m. and the pool was officially closed. However, I called the concierge to request that we be allowed to have the cake delivered there, and our request was graciously granted.

We usually stay in Four Seasons hotels, and are used to being treated well. Having said that, this stay was even better than what we normally experience. I was a little worried because I read a negative review on this site about FS Singapore, but we did not experience anything unfortunate during our time here. In fact, from the minute we were picked up from the airport until we were dropped off again, we only had a wonderful time. Before we left, reservations called us and asked if we would like to participate in a special offer of a room upgrade for a little more than we agreed upon. We said yes, and we ended up staying in a huge two bedroom suite with massive living room / dining room - it was like being a rock star! We loved every second of it. The hotel is in a great location for shopping: right on Orchard Road (from our rooms it was easy to see why the street had its name: the trees lining the road made a lovely green area between the skyscrapers), the bar and restaurants are trendy and attract locals as well as tourists or businesspeople; the hotel laundry was very good (I even took a picture of the basket our things were delivered in, it was so pretty); room service was fine, the food was pretty good and set up was faultless; I was given lessons in eating with chopsticks in the hotel restaurant by a wonderful waiter; and the tour guide which the concierge arranged for us was fantastic. He really gave us an in-depth tour of Singapore and Sentosa Island (which we wanted to have). My husband worked during our stay and found the hi speed internet access fine, and the correct plugs for various countries were supplied in a little bag in the desk. The only negative thing I can think of is that, since our youngest is nine years old, we were not allowed to visit the really nice pool which is shown on the website. We did go to the rooftop pool, however, which was perfectly fine - and almost empty. Oh- and in the evening on the first night, we experienced some noise above us (presumably at this rooftop pool... cleaning or something) but as soon as we called downstairs about it, it was stopped.

Upon getting out of the car and stepping into the lobby, I felt this air of luxury. Good start. Our check-in was smooth and we were in our rooms within minutes. The room was clean and the bathroom big. What disappointed me was the state of the bed. Clearly, housekeeping had been in the room, but did not make up the bed to the level of a Four Seasons hotel (see photo). There were also some plumbing issues in the bathroom, which the hotel management was not able to fix during our stay. I experienced a lunch and dinner service at One-Ninety, a casual, coffee shop style restaurant and, safe to say, thought the chicken rice was amazing! However, I'll warn readers that the prices are somewhat steep... it is the Four Seasons though, so I let that pass. While I was at the hotel, I also had to print out some documents after the business center had closed. The duty manager quickly opened it up for me and didn't even charge me for printing.

If you haven't ever stayed in a FS-- you may think that this hotel is the best hotel compared to other hotel chains. Unfortunately, given the \"premium\" price that FS charges, you should expect a lot more. This hotel does not deliver. I felt I was staying at a Motel 6 with really nice owners. I stayed there for ten days and we had a terrible experience-- with my wife getting sick off of a milk shake and roaches underneath the hot tray when we ordered room service. The food was also really bad for FS standards-- the morning buffet meal was overooked and the veggies were really stale. (And this is in a country where there are plantations and veggies all over the place!) For this inconvenience, we were afforded an upgrade to a slightly larger room-- only after I had asked for it. This was really a big mistake by the hotel in my view-- especially when I told them how disappointed I was at the stay thus far. Not to mention that the elevator broke down the day we were checking out so we almost missed our flight + our baggage was not guaranteed to arrive with us due to our tardiness.

Just an advice, the receptionist should not speak to the guest while having her eyes sticking on the monitor during check out. Remember, eye contact is important at all times. I have good experience staying in Four Seasons George V Paris and Hong Kong but I believe Four Seasons Singapore needs to improve more in details handling. If she wants to charge a price that is similar to St Regis, even though she could not match in terms of new gimmicks and amenities, but the least that she can do is to ensure the staff has a service oriented mind and make the guest feels welcome at all times and ensure details are observed properly to prevent silly mistakes from happening.", "Date": "February 1, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201cAs Good as it Gets\u201d", "Author": "TeganThomas", "ReviewID": "UR22894063", "Content": "We have stayed here twice now and it is impossible to fault this hotel.

Every time I've stayed at this hotel, I've noticed thoughtful evolutions of the room which were not existent or which I did not notice during my previous stay. One such development was the installation of \"international\" wire sockets -- not just in the bathroom for the shaver, but also next to the bed and next to desk so that you don't need converters for your notebook or cell phone.

Further disappointment when the staff checked us into our room. Her very first words weren't welcome but I had to pay extra for the additional guest or my spouse would not be allowed to stay with me. I politely told her that I would of course pay as that was the rule, but she reiterated herself defiantly almost without hearing me. I guess she must have had a bad day, or that the hotel had experienced too many guests piling into the room without paying extra. The room decor was also a disappointment. Stained carpets, dusty window that overlooked a tired tennis court. The toilet wash basin tap came off after I used it a couple of times. Almost scalded myself as it was difficult to control the hotwater temperature. The gym and sauna room were good, except that it felt like a maze when I first used it. Too many doors without any indication. The saving grace is the great concierge who was very prompt in booking restaurants. He got tables for me in no time.

The hotel was wonderful in so many ways. The staff couldnt do enough for you, always remembered your name, were efficient and helpful and made an enormous effort to make sure we were comfortable at all times. A special mention should be made of the Spa, its Director and the 1 particular Massage Therapist who took care of my elderly mother. She was very reluctant and was very sensitive to her body and her recent hip replacement. The Therapist was superb to her! Very gently, helpful to the point of escorting her to and from the change room and taking her down in the Service Lift so she didnt have to walk down all the steps back to the Spa Reception. We so appreciated these little kind touches! In terms of hardware, our suite was lovely - well equipped, clean and spacious. It must be said that they could probably do with an update. As mentioned here before, they are starting to look a little dowdy! Also, the in-house TV could do with a SERIOUS revamp! Our only drama with the hotel was the checking out process and the bill. We were leaving very early in the morning so requested the account the night before so that we could settle up the majority of the bill and in the morning settle the remainders - room service dinner and 1 international telephone call to home in the morning. We went through this with the girl working out our account and she seemed to understand. Finally the bill was sent up to us with several items billed to us instead of taken off as they were items included in our package ie: 2 x massages & 1 x dimsum lunch. We had to go through quite an ordeal to assure them that they were in fact inclusive items. Finally, they agreed & revised the account. Next morning we go downstairs to see the SAME GIRL - pay the last items (rs dinner & a $3 phone call) and she tries to bill us for the room tariff again for the previous night - despite having already charged us & being the one who prepped the bill the night before! Perhaps Im being petty - but I thought this was almost unforgiveable at a hotel of this standing. Also, it was the last dealing we had with the hotel - not a great way to leave our stay! Such a shame a silly thing like this should occur. Dont let it put you off though - just be very careful & check your bill, perhaps even bring your confirmation email/letter (which we didnt) just in case you need to wave in someones face!

This poses a bit of a problem for people arriving in early morning (as we did). Usually the hotel will try to arrange an early check-in, but when the hotel is busy, then this can be difficult. We had to wait a few hours, but the reception was very diligent in trying to take care of us. Wear and tear: The rooms are quite nicely furnished (as you would expect from a Four Seasons hotel), but the hotel has fallen victim to the dreaded \"rattling air-conditioning/ventilation\" syndrome which occurs in older hotels. Annoying. Location: Biz travellers like to go to hotels in the Marina Bay area, some tourists like to go to the colonial-style (i.e. Raffles, Fullerton), and those who plan to do a bit of shopping prefer the hotels located near Orchard Road (like the Four Seasons). A minor point, but the Four Seasons is not actually located on the main Orchard Road, but is a street away. Also a bit of a distance away from the main department stores as well. Thus not as convenient as the Hilton or Marriott if you are planning to do the \"shop, pop back into the hotel for a short break and drop off your bags, shop again\" routine.

Everything else was perfect and we were extremely happy with our stay. It is because we sere so happy with our first experience that we came back and stayed for 5 nights. Unfortunately our second visit was not as good as our first visit because the quality of their service had dropped significantly. First the good: Outstanding room & price Like our first visit, we also got a suite the second time. Both times I thought the rooms were excellent and the price was outstanding. For the money, I felt that I got a fantastic bargain for a hotel of this caliber. Loved the restaurants - outstanding food. Had breakfast every morning at the 190 - I thought it was excellent. Had New Year's eve dinner at Jiang-Nan Chun - food was outstanding and I really liked it. Had New Year's day brunch - also outstanding and very pleased with the food. The disappointment: I repeatedly was disappointed by the service of some of the staff members: At check-in the drinks we ordered were not delivered. Incredibly I had to call them twice to remind them to bring us our drinks. I could not believe this. Was I staying at the Holiday Inn? I emailed a complaint to the hotel manager and he apologized and offered to send me some wine and caviar. This was a very nice gesture on his part and I appreciated it - but since my wife and I did not drink wine and did not like caviar I asked him if he could send us something else instead. Some tea and cookies would be fine. Well guess what happened? He sent me the wine and caviar anyway - how disappointing. The service at the restaurant on sepearate occasions was terrible. On New Year's eve I had dinner at the restaurant. I was there with my family and my brother and his family. I was the oldest of the group. Amazingly there were no plates, utensils, or glass where I sat and no one bothered to get me anything! Did the staff think I was just there to watch my family eat? I sat there waiting to see if any of the staff would do anything. Unfortunately not - so I asked for the manager who then got me a setting. I then asked for a glass of water - surprise surprise - it never came. Everyone else at the table got their drinks except for me. They got drinks for the kids but nothing for Dad. I have never been to a restaurant in my life where the waitress did ot ask me what I wanted to drink. I was the one paying for the dinner and the staff ignored me. Needless to say I was upset and called the manager to ask her why ther staff had such a hard time getting me a simple glass of water. Fortunately the food was excellent and helped compensate for the terrible service. During breakfast one morning at the 190 the staff also just acted as if my son and I were not there. I am a very understanding and patient person - I accept the fact that no one is perfect - but the restaurant was not that busy and the staff kept going to the tables around me but always passed by my table without looking at us or asking us if we needed anything. I finally had to ask for the manager and complain to him. What garbage service. If I was staying at a cheap hotel I would not have been so disappointed, but I expected a lot more from the Four Seasons. Each time I got poor service, I was polite, pleasant, and well dressed - so there was never a reason for the staff to serve me so poorly. Maybe because I was not causcasian the staff did not feel it was important to provide me with the level of service that the Four Seasons is well known for. The concierge was also not very warm and friendly for some reason. One evening when it was quiet I went to the desk to speak with the concierge to introduce myself and to get some tips from him. I was polite and pleasant but unfortunately the Concierge did not seem interested in speaking with me even though I was the only person there. He was just luke warm and seemed like he was not interested in speaking with me. Next time I go to Singapore I will try the Fullerton or the Rtiz.", "Date": "January 4, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco", "Title": "\u201cFour Seasons Singapore Nov 2006\u201d", "Author": "PlungePoolJunkie", "ReviewID": "UR6521123", "Content": "My wife and I stayed at the Four Seasons Singapore last month - November 2006 - as \"bookends\" on a trip to Cambodia. For the first stay, we requested and received an early check-in due to our flight arrival at 11am. After arriving at Changi Airport, we took a 20 - 25 minute taxi ride to the hotel. \u00a0 Upon arrival at the hotel we were quickly greeted by the bellhop staff. Entering the lobby area, the hotel restaurants are located to the left and the concierge, a sitting area, and registration desk to the right. During check-in, we were welcomed by the Operations manager and informed by the front desk that we were upgraded to a corner room with a view. The reception desk representative then escorted us all the way to our room and conducted a quick walkthrough with us - which was a nice personal touch. \u00a0 The room was bright, airy, and clean and did have a nice view towards Orchard Road. The room had a similar interior design (light yellow color, brown marble bathroom) as the FS San Francisco. The FS provided a welcome card and small plate of fruits on the table. For our second stay, we were offered a small plate of confections. Unlike other hotels and resorts in Asia where beds tend to be on the rock-hard side, the FS bed was comfortable for sleeping. Since the hotel is located off Orchard Rd., there's not a lot of traffic noises to keep us awake or crowds to deal with. \u00a0 During our second stay, we were upgraded to a suite. The reception desk assistant escorted us again to our room. The suite was a corner room and, being a suite, obviously had separate living and sleeping areas. The suite also had a separate guest bathroom off the living room area. Even though the suite has a larger floor area than our 1st room, I'm not sure if it would have been worth the extra dollars is worth the incremental benefits. \u00a0 Since both of our stays were very short, we did not have the opportunity to experience the spa or the other hotel facilities unfortunately. However, our second stay encompassed a Sunday so we had to try their famous Sunday brunch. We normally do not frequent buffets but we both agreed afterwards FS' was excellent and would certainly recommend. We had a reservation for the 11am seating. The buffet selection was absolutely impressive: separate tables for fresh fruit juice + smoothies, Southeast Asian / Perankan entrees, Chinese entrees, Italian pasta, a made-to-order grill, sushi, cold plates / appetizers, and an outside BBQ for steaks, roasts, and sausages. And the desserts covered around 3 to 4 tables themselves! All the entrees were freshly prepared and flavorful. At each food station, there was usually a chef to prepare the entrees in front of you; This prevented the under-the-heat-lamp-for-hours or bland taste you may have experienced at other buffets. Just make sure to take a hearty appetite with you and make reservations ahead of time. \u00a0 We generally like to stay on the east coast side when visiting Singapore due to close proximity to our favorite restaurants and stores but the location of FS Singapore was convenient also. Taxi fares are pretty cheap in Singapore so being located on the east coast versus Orchard doesn't make too much of a difference. There's also the convenient MRT. Even though the FS hotel is physically not located on the central portion of Orchard Rd., it's very easy to get to the main section since there is a hallway connecting the FS and the Singapore Hilton. If you walk through the hallway to the Hilton, you'll end up around 2 - 3 blocks aways from Ngee Ann City mall. \u00a0 During previous trips to Singapore, we've stayed at different hotels: the ex-Westin Stamford, Swissotel, Raffles Plaza, and Mandarin Oriental. In comparison, the FS Singapore rooms are showing some slight wear, especially the furniture. The renovated rooms of the Mandarin Oriental are wonderfully designed and decorated: modern, sleek Asian theme, and deep colors. The rooms at the Raffles Plaza also underwent remodeling a few years ago. Hopefully FS Singapore will follow suit in the future to keep up with the local competition. On the other hand, I have to say the FS Singapore staff were much more friendly and provided a higher degree of customer service than the other Singapore hotels we have stayed at. Since we would be returning to the FS Singapore in a week, we left a piece of luggage with the concierge. The FS dilligently stored it for us and thoughtfully placed it in our room before we arrived the second time. \u00a0 The other minor issue was that the FS, surprisingly, allows smoking in the lobby sitting area. Consequently one of the first thing you notice when entering the lobby and check-in area is the odor of cigarette smoke. It would have been nice for FS to not allow smoking so all of its guests can enjoy the sitting area. \u00a0 After mentioning on a survey that it would be great to have bottled water on the nightstands (after turndown service), the General Manager responded to us that they would have this service starting in Jan 07. So they are listening to suggestions. \u00a0 Both our checkouts were efficient and smooth. After calling the porters, a taxi was always ready, pre-loaded with our luggage, and waiting for us to take us to the airport. Even though the taxis were the normal city cabs, the FS always made sure the taxi drivers ask us whether the temperature or radio settings was adequate (much like the airport transfers when you stay at a FS resort). Again, a nice personal touch by the FS. Overall, a very enjoyable stay due to the typical FS high level of customer service, the great Sunday brunch, and close proximity to Orchard Road. We'll be travelling to Singapore again in April and while we love the Mandarin Oriental's interior design and style, we'll probably stay at the FS Singapore due to the much better service level.", "Date": "December 30, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Belfast, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cExcellent hotel, but\u201d", "Author": "navigator", "ReviewID": "UR6157479", "Content": "This is a superb hotel.

The fact is, after two stays, I prefer the Four Seasons hands down. I rate the 4S \"Above average\" relative to Singapore business hotels charging a corporate rate. The other comparable hotel in my mind is the Ritz Carlton, but once again, location can play a big factor in that choice. Chances are that the Four Seasons's near-Orchard Road location is a cab ride away from where businesspeople work. Not so bad in the morning, but a bit more a struggle in the evening. What makes up for it, in my experience, is the application of the Four Seasons standard to rooms and service at this property. The service is friendly, consistent, and responsive.

I could be a cynic about this and say it was twee, but they didn't have to take the trouble so I thought it was a genuine nice touch.

We stayed at Raffles the Plaza, The Ritz-Carlton, The Four Seasons and the Shangri-La. Our third stop was the Four Seasons Hotel - A truly luxurious hotel but with some minor technical glitches. ROOM We reserved the Deluxe Room on a higher floor. The room was very spacious with high ceilings and it was well appointed. There was a medium sized regular TV (not LCD TV), a DVD Player, a writing desk with Internet access, a sitting area with huge windows overlooking Orchard Road, a separate make-up table and controls by the bed to open the curtains. The room looked well maintained despite being over 16 years old - Something the Ritz Carlton Millenia should learn to do with their dated and slightly rundown rooms! I had two gripes with the room: The first was the \"King\" bed which was more akin to queen in size, and the second was the shoddy electricity which led to some lights not working one day, but working the next. BATHROOM The bathroom was luxurious and featured L'Occitane amenities. The toilet had a bidet in a separate alcove connecting to the bathroom. There was a separate shower cubicle and a deep soak marble tub. The water pressure was low however, but this wasn't too big of a deal. HOTEL FACILITIES/RESTAURANTS The hotel offered a fitness centre/Spa and a pool, but we didn't use these facilities. There were numerous restaurants to choose from, but we only dined at One-Ninety restaurant for breakfast. Their range of food was very good - Both Asian (Chinese and Japanese) and western. If you like cheese, then this is the place to get it while in Singapore. Just remember to tell the waiters which juice you first ordered or they'll refill it with orange juice regardless of what you had in your glass beforehand. The lobby area and the grand staircase leading to the second floor were very beautiful and luxuriously appointed. SERVICE While the staff were are very friendly and courteous. We had a problem with a noisy air-conditioner in our room on both nights of our stay, but they sent someone up to fix it and gave us a discount of 50% off for the second night because of the same problem. The only big complaint I have is that the Four Seasons doesn't offer any affinity/frequent guest/frequent flyer programs. Furthermore, their tendency to use internationally unrecognised geographic names (i.e. \"Arabian\" Gulf as opposed to the correct \"Persian Gulf\") in their brochures can be insulting/politically insensitive to certain guests, especially someone of Persian descent. SURROUNDINGS The hotel itself is a mere 5 minute walk from Orchard Road, famed as the shopping area in Singapore. You can also walk and explore the area's numerous (more affordable) dinning and shopping areas. One tip is to take the indoor (air conditioned) walkway to the Hilton Hotel and onto Orchard Road rather than walk outside in the heat.

It's a good hotel, I'd stay there again, but I prefer Raffles The Plaza (which also is more convenient for the business traveller)", "Date": "December 22, 2005"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Four Seasons Hotel Singapore", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d301897-Reviews-Four_Seasons_Hotel_Singapore-Singapore.html", "Price": "$346 - $653*", "Address": "<div class=\"wrap_bl wrap\">", "HotelID": "301897", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/15/9b/159be33a67e2f80c9739a187a8f4a1062large.jpg"}}
