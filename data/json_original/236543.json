Right after we landed at Orly Sud Aeroport my husband booked as a ticket for an AirFrance Bus so we could travel comfortably as i am 5-mos pregnant. I was a little bit worried since this is our first time in Paris and we are not familiar with the place so I just depended on my husband on how to get to the hotel from the airport as he was the one who booked this hotel based on the great reviews that was written and sure it didn't disappoint us after going to the Metro and rode Line 6 we passed by 6 stops and arrived at La Motte Piquet Grenelle and after a 3mins walked we are already at the Hotel so this was really a bonus as I am not going to like if we are to walk a long way to get the hotel esp as we came on a winter season and Voila! The receptionist was very nice and professional in greeting us we proceed directly to our room and we were happy to see that our room has everything we need a nice bed, a shower, cable and most importantly a wifi connection free of charge and also fast! To make the story short I am very impressed with the way they manage this hotel it is situated in a nice place, safe, quiet, convenient, lots of cafe, convenience store and just very near 3 metro stations that will reach you to famous tourist spot but the best thing is we were able to find a very nice asian restaurant nearby which i needed to eat familiar food for me and my baby.

The area is fab and a walk to the Eiffel Tower takes about 5-10 minutes I would always recommend staying in this area of Paris as it's a great price with great connections to rest of city. The hotel was good, clean and very easy to find - my only problems were that the shower cubicle was a bit of a tight fit to get into (I think double rooms might have baths as well as showers?) The twin room had a view of the street (as opposed to the double which mainly have view of the hotels pretty courtyard) but I did not mind as I liked watching the goings on of the street. The street the hotel was on is very quiet as it is just off the main road. The rooms were nicely decorated with French style and had enough space to easily walk around beds/desk - only real problem with the bedroom area was the lack of safe to lock things in, and also when having a lay in on a couple of occasions the cleaners walked in (even though I had double locked the door and left the key in) which was a bit awkward and surprising - but we had no problem with them, we communicated in my broken French and they left us to it!

Lots of caf\u00e9s and restaurants are close by and if you want to equip yourself for a picknick in the beautiful Champs de Mars (a leisurely 10-minute walk) you can pick up food on the first floor of the Monoprix branch right around the corner of the hotel. The bedside lamp and one electrical socket were not working and I kindly asked staff to take care of this but nothing happened.

The twin room was clean, and cosy, though a little on the small/ narrow side. No complains about that though, as the hotel makes very good use of the compact space. There is a small desk / chair by the window and a flat panel TV. The bathroom is nicely and naturally lit by the light coming from its tall windows which are fitted with wooden blinds. It is again on the compact side, but spacious and comfortable enough for the hotel to also fit a hairdryer in, as well as a movable shelf for you to put your stuff on. The single room was nice, basic and mostly clean except that I found a dead fly by the curtains and somebody's leftover tank top in the wardrobe. Hence, the cleaning process was not really thorough. I had good nights of sleep here as the ambience of the room is really cosy for one. Other than the cosy and clean rooms, the hotel is at a fantastic location: very near the metro (<5mins walk), and has a lift (thank god!). Staff are helpful and speaks good English. There's also a supermarket (Monoprix), McDonald's, a good selection of restaurants (including Chinese food, Sushi / Jap food, Pizza Hut) and cafes, as well as a shopping strip consisting of brands such as H&M, Zara and GAP just on the next street / around the corner. Free wifi is also available for all rooms though the quality of connection varies - sometimes there aren't any network found at all. The staff mentioned that they are working on improving this and hence, the free wifi issue should be resolved in no time. Overall, I love this hotel for its cosiness, convenience (the lift is a gods end, really!) and its fantastic location. It is very easy to eat, shop, get around from this hotel's location which is so near the metro.

Our first stop was in London and Paris was our second. The hotel itself was very well located to the Metro, walking distance to mcdonalds and a very huge supermarket at the corner. The staff working in the hotel are friendly and they speak english . We stayed for 4 nights, and our room was by the garden.There wasn't any air condition in the room, there is a standing fan given to us, but the room was way too cramp with our luggage and stuff. It was a wrong choice to pick the room by the garden, because mosquitos flew in and never get out when we open the window, the tree is just next to our room. The bathroom was a hazard itself, because there is no handle whatsoever for us to hold on in order to get out from the shower. I almost lost my balance and fall. The lift itself is a blessing, because i was told many budget accomodation doesn't have elevator serving their floor. The elevator can only fit two person and one small piece of luggage. Meaning , when we were assigned to our room on the first day, we made a total of 3 trips, from the lobby and to our room. We requested for 2 extra pillows, but only manage to get 1. There is no tea making facility and no such thing as tea bags and coffix mix and no mineral water provided. You are kinda like , \"on your own\" The LCD tv is fix to the wall, it was pretty hung high up,and we got to lift up our head in order to watch tv programmes, after ten minutes, our neck starts to ache, and its better to switch off the tv completely, trust me, its going to be occupational health issue, if i strained my neck. If you are on a budget, like you can only afford maximum 80 Euro per night, then this hotel is a pretty decent choice, because out of the 80 euro you are paying, 40 euro is for the location, which is near the metro,mcdonalds. the remaining 40 euro is for the friendly service staff, a place to sleep and to shower.

The other thing is that breakfast is not included. Everything else is good: location right near an important metro stop (La Motte), walking distance from Eiffel Tower, location in the normal residents' area of Paris meaning that you have access to better prices. The styling is really pleasant with soft colours and the TV includes an extensive channel list. The location is on a quiet street which keeps noise down, and the service was always attentive. Free wifi included. Here's a small tip: if you're looking for a street side breakfast, walk down Rue du Commerce until you see a cafe called something like Cafe du Commerce next to a small park with the Commerce metro stop. You'll get a breakfast for 5.50 instead of the usual 8-10 you pay elsewhere. Also, if you're trying to keep your food costs down, there are two Chinese restaurants in the area where you'll pay about 6 euros for a good meal instead of the usual 10-15 everywhere else.

Although we have some French, we found the level of English very good among management staff, the room and bathroom of good size, and the location, 5 minutes from a really good metro station at Motte Piquet-Grenelle, really good. It is also a reasonable taxi ride from Gare Montparnasse, which is a drop off for buses from Charles de Gaulle airport. While not right in the centre of the city, metro transport makes it a very satisfactory location, and the Eiffel Tower is about 15 min walk anyway. Breakfast is a bit more expensive than available at local cafes, but ample and nicely served. We preferred to start each day that way. There are plenty of good reasonably priced restaurants not far away for evening meals. A computer was provided free for reasonable periods of Internet use.

I woukld often get my breakfast (croissant, great quiche which they'll heat for you) and pick up a sandwich to carry with me for lunch. On the weekend next door is a creperie. Also a VERY tasty breakfast which will cost you less than half of what the hotels charge for breakfast. There are others nearby as well, including a great patisserie. Lots of ethnic food within 1-2 blocks, too. I ate twice at the Indian/Pakistan restaurant en route to the metro. Across from the staion is a Spanish restaurant with excellent paella. If you're like me and like to stay away from the tourist spots, this is your place. You'll see daily life and still be close to the must-see places. The metro station is where major lines cross. It's really hard to beat this location. Rooms were eurotypical, although I agree with another poster that the shower was larger than most. I had a room facing the street, and even with the window open noise wasn't a real problem. There is a quaint spiral staircase but also an elevator. If you aren't used to it, you don't take the key with you when you leave the hotel. Leave it at the front desk. When you return, give them your room number, and they give you the key. Kind of nice actually, esp since they're bulky. On the weekend there is also a marche de puce (flea market) by the metro station. It's fun to walk around and check things out there. Some good deals as well. Yet again a great place to see typical Parisian life. I HIGHLY recommend getting the museum pass if you plan on going to see more than one of the museums or monuments. It saved me hours of waiting in line since the more popular places have special lines for pass holders. In one case, at the Rodin museum, they were closed for a special event; however, if you had a pass, you could still get in and get full access. So it's worth the money. There are numerous places you can buy them. I went to Versailles, went to the C gate and bought my pass there. Super short line, and once you enter there you have easy access everywhere. I also recommend the carte orange (metro pass). Get the zone 1-5 for just a tad bit more, and there's virtually nowhere you can't go, which includes to and from the airport. It covers buses and the funiculaire at Montmartre which will save you a steep climb up to Sacre Coeur, which is a good idea if you plan on climbing the stairs to the dome. Can't recommend this hotel enough.

If someone else can find a hotel of similar quality for a similar price with a location in a neighborhood as nice as this with transportation connections that are as convenient, I would be very interested to know the name, because in my opinion these are l\u2019Avre\u2019s strengths, and they are a rare combination. (I have been living in Paris for over 10 years.) First, for a European capital city, it is very inexpensive considering the location. Yes, rooms are small, but this is not a 5-star hotel, and even in most European 5-stars, Americans would find the rooms small. European size standards are different. The rooms are spotlessly clean and if you ask for one on the garden side, very quiet. Even on the street side noise is minimal. The bathrooms are also very clean. Second, you are within a 10 minute walk of the Eiffel Tower, and the La Motte Piquet metro station encompasses 3 subway lines that will whisk you to pretty much anywhere you would want to be in Paris in under 20 minutes. You can get to the gorgeous Opera Garnier in less than 10 minutes on the line 8, or the Champs-Elys\u00e9es in 15 minutes on the line 6 (if you go directly to the Etoile. Alternately, you could take the line 8 to Concorde and walk down the avenue for the view). Concorde is also the stop that takes you to the Tuileries Garden and the Louvre. The line 10 will put you in the heart of the Latin Quarter, get off at after 15 minutes at Od\u00e9on for the Luxembourg Gardens, Cluny La Sorbonne for exactly that or Maubert Mutualit\u00e9 for Notre Dame\u2026 I could go on and on but the location is really ideal. The rue du Commerce is appropriately named, with tons of shops on it, and the neighborhood has some very good, reasonably priced restaurants. My opinion of the staff varies. Some of the staff are *very* friendly and helpful, others are just adequate, doing their job satisfactorily but without going out of their way to be warm. The owner himself can sometimes be very charming and at other times somewhat cooler, but never rude. For travelers on a budget or those who believe that a hotel is just a place to sleep, not a social centre, and who prefer to spend the bulk of their time out visiting one of the world\u2019s most beautiful cities, the Hotel de l\u2019Avre is very good value for the money.

You really have to weigh it up. If you want to stay somewhere surrounded by quaint boutiques and restaurants i.e St Germain, be prepared to pay the price but the quality of hotels in relation to what you pay at Hotel de L\u2019Avre will not be comparable. What I liked especially about the hotel besides the very personalised one to one customer service was the way you got to experience a little bit of true Parisian life for a very good price. Sitting out in the little garden in the evening with a glass of wine cannot be beaten. There were no problems with booking. I went to the hotel site direct and got a confirmation 24 hours later. The rooms were spotlessly clean and very comfortable. My only one small gripe is that I stayed in room no.1 which was right in the reception area and near to the lift and sometimes it can be a bit noisy with patrons coming home late although it only happened to me once at about midnight. The area is perfect and is so close to the metro station with three lines running in different directions. If you get off at La Motte please do not use the Rue Suffren exit, use the other as the hotel is nearer and literally across the street. The area around the hotel was perfect for a solo traveller like myself. There are cafes and restaurants where you can eat well and cheap for a fraction of the prices you\u2019d pay in the more touristy areas. I did not eat in the hotel when you can get a coffee and croissant for 3 euro\u2019s from the many caf\u00e9\u2019s in the area. Another reviwer complained that the restaurants are pricey - not true. This area is quite residential and is not over run with tourist menus. I had a meal at Le Roi Du Couscous (North African) 112 Blvd de Grenelle for 12 euros including wine and the meal was HUGE, enough for two. At Cafe Peirrot (next to the metro) you can have a French breakfast of orange juice, hot drink, croissant, baguette and jam for 7 euro's. . It is a little way from the major sites but like I said if this is your first visit and you want to be within walking distance of the major Parisian sites or if you want a large room that feels like your own home, you may want to look elsewhere.

Sadly our French is even worse, but from reviews on here, I was expecting to have no problem. Unfortunately, she was the most fluent in English of any other employee that we met. One man spoke absolutely no English. This would have been okay still, if they had been friendly at all. But they really were not, I'm disappointed to say. The room was fine. There are photos of it that others have posted here (it was the room with the red pillows hanging above the bed, on the wall). The bathroom was seriously small, the shower just big enough for me to turn around in. Still, it was adequate. One bonus, I loved the fan in the closet! I always sleep with a fan on at home, for the noise, so I was glad to have it. Not just for the noise, though...it was so humid in our room all the time!

We bought bread, cheese, and meat for lunches, and we left it out on the window ledge so that it would stay cool. One lunchtime, we came back to find our door open, and inside, the window open (we always closed it while we were gone, so we knew someone else had opened it). The maid was down the hall, cleaning another room, and we waved at her to let her know we were going to be back in our room for a little bit. We gathered our food from the ledge and discovered that our cheese (a large, new wedge) was missing. Every other thing was still there. We looked down on the ground outside, knowing it was unlikely that it had fallen (there was a big rail thing on the ledge that would have prevented it, plus everything else was still there), and there was no sign of it. The only answer we could come up with, strange as it was, was that the maid had taken it! We were rather flabbergasted, and wanted to report it, but we had had enough of trying to communicate with the desk staff and were leaving the next day, so we let it go.

While the hotel itself is quite small and charming, it's not equipped with many modern amenities, and is not competitive with most modern business/superior class hotels. I was personally quite put off by the decor in my room, which looked like it had been decorated for a fussy old lady, but my middle-aged friend (female), found it to be \"quaint\". The hotel was located in a very quiet area of Paris, but you'll still likely experience some street noise. I was woken up two nights in a row by loud pedestrians around 3 a.m., and the garbage was picked up on Saturday around 6 a.m. While it's true that few tourists would want to spend much of their vacation in bed, light sleepers should think about brining along a pair of earplugs. The staff was quite pleasant, and you really shouldn't encounter any problems at check-in (or anywhere in Paris, for that matter), if you have basic French skills.

The room was tiny but this is Paris and the hotel is, for Paris, quite reasonable. While the room in reality was not quite as pretty as the very flattering pictures on the hotel's homepage led me to believe, the furnishings were tasteful with some nice old pieces and nothing from Ikea. The beds were comfortable and did not sag. Everything was clean and everything worked except the lamp on the desk. Our room on the 4th floor faced the street and was very quiet. The view from our window was very nice. Now that most hotels in Europe offer a breakfast buffet that is normally included in the price of the room, I was surprised to find the old-fashioned breadstuff-butter-marmelade version at a price of almost 7 Euros per person. We considered going elsewhere but considering Paris prices decided that the same modest breakfast would probably have cost about the same in a caf\u00e9 and there is a certain comfort to having breakfast in the hotel. The coffee was very good, typical French coffee with warm milk to add to one's own taste. The other breakfast ingredients were of very good quality: decent glass of juice, a really good croissant, a large piece of a crusty baguette, two pats of butter, individual jar of good marmelade, individual serving of cream cheese. Maybe the staff didn't all speak English but they were patient with my less-than-fluent French. As other reviewers have said, the location is excellent, with good local infrastructure and 2-3 minutes from a M\u00e9tro station that is served by three lines. The one problem I would like to mention is something I have encountered in many hotels. In the bathroom there will be a sign asking you to consider protecting the environment by re-using your towels. I would be delighted to comply, if there were a place to hang up the towel so that it could dry. I really don't like to use a towel that is still damp from yesterday's shower.

We bought a daily travel ticket for just over 8 Euros and certainly got our value from it. At no time during our stay did we feel threatened or uncomfortable walking around at night near the hotel (or anywhere else for that matter). The Hotel itself is family run and friendly. We stayed on the ground floor beside the lift but were not disturded at any time by other guests using it. The front door is locked at all times and is openned by the reception staff when you ring the bell. We found our room to be more than adequate for the job with clean bed linen and a very clean en suite facility. The towels were changed each day and the room tidied and cleaned.

They set up in the morning and tear down at night. There are days when the market is not there. The breakfast in the hotel for E7.50/pp for one croissant, french bread, juice and coffee is really good. I find it a little expensive since you can get that in the market for less the E2.00, but it's still worth it. The bread is really good. The room is clean but not the best. The mattress had a plastic liner that made it uncomfortable and sweaty to sleep in. The only problem was that you can't take food to your room which makes a big difference coz having a sit down dinner is two to three times more expensive than buying crepes or panini and just taking it to your room.

Now returning from our trip, I wanted to share our positive experience. We were only in Paris for one night last week, and the hotel was just as everyone described, accomodating, very clean (hard to find in 2 & 3 star Paris hotels), not to mention storing our luggage until our room was ready (we arrived very early since we were there one day). We opted for the deluxe double with the garden view and it was very quiet. Just keep in mind, these are still typical small Paris hotel sized rooms with very firm beds. But that is what we wanted since we were only there for the night and really did not unpack our suitcases. Location: It was out of the main stream, tho in the 15e, it just bordered the southern part of 7e and gave us \"next door\" access to the Eiffel & Louvre. Anytime we needed a taxi, the staff was most willing to call us one. Our only hesitancy about this hotel was the quiet you got from it's obscurity became a liability because we did not find a single taxi drive that knew where this hotel or street was. I luckily always carry maps with me so I pulled one out to show our driver when we arrived. After checking in, it was easy to hand them the hotel card which had a map on the back (front desk have these sitting out). Later we thought of an easier solution, to tell them to simply take us to the bus station or McDonalds, a short 1/2 block around the corner. Finally, because this was our first visit, and all the staff spoke English, it was an easier visit than most first time Americans I know who don't have a handle on their French yet (we are among that bunch).
