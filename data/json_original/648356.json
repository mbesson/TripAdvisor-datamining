There are many scuba diving schools in Sanur, but most will pick you up at your hotel for free, so I wouldn't use this as a reason to choose a hotel in the city. The beaches are supposed to be the best in Bali, but the water and shore had loads of garbage in it, the most disgusting of which was massive amounts of eaten corn cobs, which are sold all over the beach and discarded pretty much everywhere. People selling all kinds of things (souveniers, drinks, manicures, jewelry) will harrass you on the beach, not just when you're walking to your spot, but when you're sitting in a beach chair trying to relax or have a conversation with your companions. It's really annoying. The hotel itself was not bad, but rather disappointing. I booked the Deluxe Sea View Room hoping that the previous reviewer had just gotten the only bad sea view room, but apparently they're all like that. What you really get is a Place Where People Eat Breakfast and Swim View Room, and if you squish your body into the very far left corner of the window and look past the giant tree and restaurant, you can see the beach. If you stay here, do not pay extra for the sea view room. The room itself was very nice and comfortable, though the bathroom was a little dirty, with mold on the faucets and showerhead. It wasn't uncomfortable by any means, but I was expecting more with this Deluxe Sea View room and will not stay here again when I go to Bali. The biggest plus is the amazing Italian restauarant just a block or two down from the hotel. It's called The Village, and we ate there every day. They had amazing food, desserts, coffee, and drinks, and I will definitely go out of my way to eat at this restaurant the next time I'm in Bali, but I will not stay in Sanur again, especially not at the Respati.", "Date": "Apr 7, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR763920520", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "1"}, "Author": "nxf83"}, {"Content": "Nice relaxing Hotel       View of hotel from beach", "Date": "Jan 22, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR297819614", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "greatsotsgreatplaces"}, {"Content": "Great Find       Hotel area", "Date": "Nov 16, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR604296821", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "laurieSue"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297700-d648356-r22399401-Respati_Sanur_Beach_Hotel-Sanur_Bali.html", "HotelID": "648356", "Price": "$67"}}
