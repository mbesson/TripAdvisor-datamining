The usual check-in time is after 3 but we arrived at about noon and we were able to check in with no problems. The room we were allocated was rather small, after experiencing big ones in DC but it was cosy. The doorway was rather dark, seeing that there wasn't any overhead lights. The bed was rather small but comfortable and the bathroom was pretty small but clean! The daily breakfast was the usual fare but certainly good enough if you are on a budget. They have tiny teapots for hot water which you can help yourself to 24 hours a day with complimentary teas and coffee at the bar downstairs. The location is probably the best since it is a block away from Copely station, Newbury Street, Prudential and the library is just right across from the hotel. Overall, this is a decent and convenient place if you are on a budget. The staff were friendly enough, even offering tips on what to do and where to eat in Boston.

The \"name brand\" hotels I would usually stay in were either sold out or prices were outside the budget. When I started to extend my search I found the Charlesmark. It was within a mile of my meeting and it seemed like a good alternative. I checked their website for parking choices as well. Overall I was very happy with the hotel. It was only me so the size of the room wasn't an issue. It was clean, well appointed and had a nice modern feel. The small wardrobe as others have mentioned is a drawback, but they had two hooks on the wall where you can place hangers/clothing, so not really a problem. The lounge has an arrangement with the Thai restaurant next door, so I ordered a dinner and the bartender brought it to me within about 10 minutes. That and a glass of wine was perfect. The breakfast was coffee, fruit, bagels and donuts in the upper lounge area, starting at 7am. That was fine with me. I had room 106, which is the first floor in the back, with a view of the alley. I really didn't care until about 5:30 the next morning when a trash truck woke me up! Avoid that room if you can... The only other issue I would report is parking. The website said for quickest walk, pass the hotel, take left on Dartmouth, left on Newbury, left on Exeter, and the garage is on the right. I pulled into the garage that ended up being valet only, which I don't really like.. It also closes at midnight and reopens at 7am. That worked for me, so I decided to stay. They quoted me a price and when I cam back at 7:12am the next morning they quoted me 5 dollars more because I wasn't there at 7am.... Now, in the room in their hotel book on the night stand they also had parking information - but on that page it said turn left on Exeter, CROSS OVER BOYLESTON, and the garage will be on your right.

The room faces the alley at the allet level and had numerous trash bins (the large rectangular metal ones). I went to the front desk again to ask about trash pickup day. The woman did not know when yhe trash pickup day was, but assured us that 101 was a very quiet room. No trash pickup on Sunday morning...gloriously quiet, comfortable, more space than we needed. Then, Monday morning, 2am...until 4:30am, the various sanitation companies drove their trucks through the alleys and pickep up, dumped and slammed down the now empty metal bins. This was followed by a delivery truck idling outside those lovely windows, so we left early to catch breakfast near the hospital facility. We asked about the trash pickup and complained about the noise...this gentleman said the pickip was every day. After following up our cimplaint through managers, we were offered room 103, which has no exterior walls, but is on a short hallway to rooms 101 and 102. THIS is the room you want for quiet.

The Hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s location on Boylston Street is perfect. It's a short walk from the shops on Newbury Street, opposite the Copley T stop, and is a short walk from lots of nice bars and restaurants. The hotel is fairly small for Boston, with only 7 rooms on each floor. The rooms are not particularly big but are fine if you are traveling alone, and they have all the facilities that you'd expect. On the first night I was woken at 3.30 am by the garbage truck at the back of the hotel emptying bins for 30 mins. I called reception and asked to change rooms but unfortunately the hotel was full that night. The night receptionist did go to the effort of finding me some earplugs though which was appreciated. The following morning I had to leave early but was informed by email during the day that I had been given a change of room and that my belongings had been moved for me - Great service! My new room was slightly bigger and a lot quieter thankfully. The free Breakfast was simple but very nice (Bagels, Juice, Coffee, Donuts) and was served in a nice comfortable room above the bar. The hotel was clean and well kept throughout. The Hotel bar had a good range of drinks and although we didn't try the food, it did look really nice when others had it. Given the Hotel's location, its cleanliness, the complimentary breakfast, and the extremely helpful and professional staff , this hotel is fantastic value for money and would suit 90% of people visiting Boston for work or pleasure.

First of all this is a no frills hotel. The reception is shared with the restaurant on the downstairs level and there's no breakfast/dinner or gym available. Meanwhile the rooms and corridors to the rooms are small and tight and not for those lovers of open-spaces. However, the rooms are very modern and sleak and are usually accompanied by a floor to wall mirror which gives the false sense of more space. I also had surround sound in my room which was a nice surprise so I could bang out some David Bowie while I was getting ready. Ultimately though the location is what makes this hotel. It's in the middle of ALL action in Boston, whether it's local to Back Bay (shopping at the Pru or on Newbury Street) or a 10 minute walk into Boston and the nearby Theater District. It's a clean and modern place to crash after a long day in Boston although perhaps it's not for the type of people who like hanging out in their rooms all day.

It is a great value for the location, and included a basic breakfast. This was not a greatbreakfast but good enough for me, as I had to be at a conference for job interviews, and didn't really need any added stress to the day of finding breakfast. Like some of the other reviews on here, I found the front desk staff to be, well, unfriendly at times. I was coming and going most of the three days I was there, due to circumstances, and rarely did I get a hello or acknowledgement of my entering the building. The exception were the wonderfully cool, friendly housekeepering staff and the person who checked me in. The one time I ate at the bar, there were three bartenders on, but only one was actually attentive to the customers. Like some others, I had to be a conference the day I checked out, so before my flight I asked the staff to hold my bags. Having read the reviews on here, I was aware that this meant my bags were going to be left tied up in the bar and in plain sight of passersby. This did not really bother me, as I was aware of this issue before I checked in. The staff was also nice enough to hold my laptop bag behind the desk for most of the day, which was much appreciated. Only once did I come back and the room was not made up, unlike some of the other reviews listed here, but again, I was keeping odd hours at the hotel. As a single traveler used to city living, the size of the room did not bother me so much, but it seems I may have recieved some sort of upgrade. The bathroom was large and well designed. I found the bed plenty comfortable, though I agree that the living space may be small for some. I did not mind, as I was travelling alone. My main complaint about the Charlesmark was the room lighting, which was so bad I thought I might go blind after my three nights, as I am a reader and computer user and need light. The room faced an air shaft, had only one window, and no overhead light in the main space-- only lights by the door, and dim lights by the bedside tables, and which did not provide much light. Overall, I recommend this hotel, but keep in mind all of the things that have been mentioned in previous reviews and you won't be dissapointed. I've stayed in higher priced hotels in similar cities and have recieved a lot less for my dollar. I would recommend, however, that the management work on the lighting issue and making sure that the front desk staff acknowlegdes people when they come into the hotel.

Right out the CharlesMark front door brings you to some of the best shops and restaurants on Boylston and Newbury Streets; there's Copley Square, Trinity Church, and the park at Copley Square; and across the street is the Boston Public Library. The CharlesMark has a better location than both the Westin or Copley Marriott hotels and costs a fraction of the price. The rooms are cozy and incredibly well-organized and nicely designed. The staff is very friendly and helpful, and they let you in on all the \"secrets\" of enjoying Boston like a Bostonian, rather than steering you to over-priced tourist traps like other hotels. Staying at the CharlesMark makes you feel like a Bostonian (even though you're stay is temporary). Be warned though, the CharlesMark makes Boston so inviting and wonderful you might be tempted to move there! Basically, the CharlesMark is just a whole heck of a lot friendlier and more personal than other hotels. Did I mention there's a great lounge downstairs? Well, yes, there is! The street-level lounge is cheery and well-lighted during the day (and includes a wonderul little outdoor patio with tables and chairs). In the morning the lounge hosts a FREE help-yourself continental breakfast of bagels and cream cheese, muffins, toast, fresh fruit, coffee, juice, etc. and basically has the pleasant ambience of a European pensione. In the afternnon it's a perfect place to come back and have a cool drink on the patio before heading to your room. At night the lounge becomes a hip Back Bay neighborhood place to have a drink at night. It's the perfect combination --- hip, friendly, and not loud at all (the lounge was active the nights we stayed, but when we got to our room, we didn't hear a thing and it was as quiet as a cabin in Vermont!). And are you interested in the Boston Marathon? The CharlesMark is is situated exactly at the Boston Marathon finish line! What could be more convenient to runners and their families and spectators than that?! All in all, the CharlesMark is a unique blend of charm, friendliness, utility, convenience, great location, and cost effectiveness.

The hotel was good about moving us the next day to a quieter room. (Really, they should just charge less for these rooms and let folks know the bargain they're striking!) Other than that, absolutely no complaints. A great deal. P.S.

Consequently we quickly eliminated one cheap hotel. We found most hotels were very expensive. However, one that was within our means was the Charlesmark. Having read the reviews we decided on a Queen size room, rather than standard. Booking the hotel was no problem - we exchanged emails and everything went smoothly - the hotel staff were very helpful. No charges were made until after we arrived. By UK standards, the room was a good size. We flew into Boston airport and easily took the metro all the way from the airport to Copley station, which was only a few steps from the hotel. We are both in our 50s but had no problems coping with a suitcase each and a flight bag. Well recommended as the metro cost only $2 each. The hotel was in a great location, directly opposite the Boston Public Library which was well worth visiting. We did have a few criticisms of the room and hotel. We had a sofa in our room but there were no lights nearby for reading purposes. The TV was too high for comfortable viewing from the sofa. The TV and audio/video equipment appeared to be of a good quality. There were not many places to store our clothes etc. The room did not have curtains - blinds instead which took a few minutes to get used to operating. The bathroom was clean and plenty of space, although the shower door only just cleared the WC. The shower was spacious and lots of lovely hot water - no bath but we knew that. Although continental breakfast was free, it was very basic, consisting of bagels, doughnuts, orange juice, coffeee, tea and possibly a type of cereal. Sadly, although it was supposed to be ready from 0700, the breakfast was not always all there. Furthermore the gentleman putting everything out was not particularly friendly or chatty. Lastly there were 2 larges TVs in the breakfast area which were always on and on the loud side. The rooms did not have coffee/tea facilities but 24 hour supplies were available near the breakfast area. All-in-all, although there were some minor faults, we very much enjoyed our stay at this hotel and would definitely stay there again. We would also recommend it to others - best to get a Queen sized room if you want a bit of space.", "Date": "July 24, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston", "Title": "\u201cGreat Value in Boston's Back bay\u201d", "Author": "RuralMA", "ReviewID": "UR34059457", "Content": "My wife and I stayed here on July 3rd as sort of a \"get away from the kids\" night.

Since I was in Boston to run the marathon, sleep was important. The walls and ceiling were very poorly soundproofed and every time someone above us walked around the joists creaked like crazy. Light music or TV in adjoining rooms was very audible and normal level talking out in the tiny hallway came through the door loud and clear. You have satellite TV, but in the smaller rooms it was 8 feet up in the air to your side so you had to wrench your head to watch it. There wasn't a particularly good selection of movies or sports that came by default and ordering PPV was not allowed. I've never experienced that before. The DVD player in our room only played CDs.

Two free to use high speed internet terminals (always available, never a queue) is something not always complimentary. The breakfast also saves you a few bucks on your holiday budget and for most people the breakfast would be fine.

The fruit and beverages are available free in the lounge 24 hours in fact, plus the daily papers. There are no egg/quarter of a pig options, so if that is what rings your bell then the breakfast will be no bonus to you Traffic noise is something that seems to divide opinion, and I can say that from our sixth floor front facing room you can in fact hear the sounds from the street, but they are by no means insufferable. I guess it depends on what you are already accustomed to. I do appreciate that some people will be used to deathly quiet nights and a small amount of noise can be very unsettling.

Again, building is small but the elevator is full size. Food - The hotel has an adequate and basic breakfast available for free. There's a Thai restaurant right next door. I didn't try it but the other guests seem to like it. They serve in the hotel as if it were a hotel restaurant, but it is not. There are many nearby eating places, from cheap and fast to very upscale. On busy nights, wait times can be from one to two hours so make reservations early. We tried the Legal Seafoods at the nearby Prudential - overrated. We settled for the Cheesecake Factory also at Prudential (we had enough seafood and gourmet cooking during our cruise). It's the best value as restaurants here are too expensive. Attractions - I cannot emphasize enough about the central location of this place. In two hours, we leisurely walked from the hotel, to the Gardens, Commons, Freedom Trail up to the Quincy Market. We took the T green line back (that sucked). On an evening, we walked around Newbury just behind the hotel. Did I say that the hotel is in the middle of everything? Plumbing problems and such - NONE. Everything worked just fine. Check out - Also painless. We left early for the airport and the gentleman manning the desk was nice enough to help us with our bags and even risked life and limb to step into the street with a whistle and a flashlight to hail a cab from the nearby Lennox hotel for us. Before we had a chance to thank him, he was already walking away. I say this because he did so very professionally, not hanging around expecting a tip or anything.", "Date": "October 17, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, CA", "Title": "\u201cPerfect place to stay in Boston!\u201d", "Author": "auntietat", "ReviewID": "UR20759415", "Content": "Stayed at the Charlesmark from 9/29 to 10/4, based on the great reviews on Tripadvisor.com.

You might think that this would be a quiet option (i.e. away from the main, busy street) but it was a bit of a nightmare, for two reasons. First, there's a very noisy vent that blows loudly through the night. With ear plugs, one can just about handle this. But second, at 3.30am every night an extremely loud garbage truck comes by, very slowly, to pick up what sound like glass bottles from the bins behind the restaurants. Yikes. It was really painful being woken up both nights by this crazy, crashing noise (I was in town to give some lectures, and so having sleep interrupted was a real downer). So you should be aware of this problem. If you are a very heavy sleeper, maybe you'll be fine.

The hotel rooms are small (around 3m by 5m for the main room) but it didn't bother us - we have stayed in smaller rooms in the US, and a lot of thought had clearly gone into making the most of the space (tabletop ironing board in the cupboard, pull-out bedside table space). The bed seemed to be a little bit short, though. The building is very overlooked but the hotel has venetian blinds for privacy. The bathroom was shower only, but it was great. The room itself was very clean and a good size and the shower was very powerful and hot. Shampoo, shower gel, body lotion and mouthwash were provided. The TV allows free access to hundreds of channels and there was also a DVD player and stereo in the room. Local phone calls are free - but longer distance or international calls are not available through the hotel's phone system; you have to buy a phone card from the CVS or Walgreen's stores (about 1-2 mins from the hotel) and use this to dial out. There were two internet terminals in the hotel lounge which were free to use (and very seldom in use!). There was no safe in the room, and no minibar. However, there was an icebucket, and ice was available from a machine on the first floor. The bar in the hotel was great (very strong cocktails!) so there wasn't much call for a minibar in any case. Housekeeping left two free bottles of water in the room each day. The best thing about the Charlesmark is the location - right in the centre of town opposite the public library and 2 minutes from the Copley T stop. The next street up is Newbury Street, which is great for shopping and even better for finding somewhere good to eat and drink in the evening. It was also easy to get around Boston from the hotel - both on foot and using the T. The hotel breakfast is basic and self-service but good quality: lots of different bagels (with jam and cream cheese), oatmeal sachets, doughnuts, muffins and fruit, plus coffee, fruit juice and iced water. For something more substantial, the cafe in the Trident Bookstore on Newbury Street serves really delicious cooked breakfasts.

I arrived early (my fault) and my room wasn't ready. The receptionist checked for any available rooms but said the only one she had was near the bar and I had asked for a quiet one - top marks for knowing my request and acting on it. She said she'd ring me when my room was ready and took my mobile phone number - great. Unfortunately she never did ring, so that was a shame and left me wandering around the city for longer than I needed to, but not a big deal and she did store my luggage. I returned later that afternoon and they'd already moved my bags from their store up to my room - fantastic service! The room was very nice, wonderfully clean & beautifully decorated, with great attention to detail. Not a massive room, but perfectly fine - don't listen to the people whining about tiny tiny rooms and poor decoration, unless you're planning on bringing more than a couple of suitcases when it might get crowded. However, despite being given a \"quiet\" room overlooking an outdoor void / shaft surrounded by brick walls, I was repeatedly woken all night by a huge fan at the bottom of this void that kept starting up, running for 10 minutes and then shutting down again. Every time it restarted (regularly, roughly every 30 minutes) there was a large bang before the loud whirring started. I could have slept through the whirring, but the bang woke me up every time all night. There are several other rooms overlooking this fan, so I can't see how anybody in any of them could have got much sleep either. I complained the next morning and got moved to another room, which was actually bigger and nicer than the first, but at the front of the hotel. This was a bit noisier than I would have liked (you overlook the main road) but at least it quietened down later at night, unlike the fan. So what to conclude? I really liked the style of the hotel, the food downstairs from the Thai restaurant was excellent, the rooms were great and it's very good value. I was slightly annoyed that I ordered a gin and tonic from the bar and it was completely flat - when I called the waitress over she immediately asked if it was flat...so why did she give it to me? She replaced it very politely, with a fractionally less flat G&T, but it was still far from sparkling. So I'm giving the Charlesmark an average rating because I really wouldn't go back there because I couldn't be sure I'd get any sleep.

I had done a lot of cheking prior to making a reservation because it is a pretty expensive town in which to stay, and even the \"conference rates\" for other hotels were out of my limited budget. Then I discovered the Charlesmark, which is a true diamond in the rough. Sandwiched between a Ritz Camera store and a really cool Thai place, the hotel is small and lean. I had read some critiques of the rooms being somewhat small and dark, and they were accurate. I could live with the size, but despite the best efforts of the staff, they could not find me a lamp. But that was cool, because the Charlesmark staff is second to none in terms of the personality and customer service skills of the staff. Unfortunately, I can't remember all the names, but Nikki - who took my reservation, helped get me a sweet deal (for the area) on the room and never acted annoyed with my umpteen million calls with an equal amount of questions; Vanessa at the bar who makes a mean margarita and always had a welcoming, friendly smile, and Scott, the other guy who worked the desk, stand out in particular. There are others, but in general, I was very happy with the staff, as many of the other area hotels won't give you the time of day when you call to ask a question, or need some help, or just a friendly face when your hoisting a drink or two at the end of the day. And the location of this place is awaesome as well, as you can pretty much walk to all the cool spots, and cabs are all over the place if you're not up to it. The only real negative, aside from the aforementioned minor inconveniences mentioned above is that there is a large population of homeless folks in this area, and while safety was never really a concern, they constantly hit you up for change. It got a to a point where I was recognizing them and even got a few of their names. But I understand this is a problem with the city in general, so it's not a beef with the hotel itself. Would I stay there again? You bet! In fact, I'd still be there now were it not for the fact that I have an early flight and wanted to be cloer to Logan. Plus they were booked tonight when I tried to add a fifth one on when my travel plans changed. But even then, they put me on a list to let me know if anything opened up, and no doubt would have set me up, as right as I was leaving, there was a cancellation. Unfortunately, I was set to get closer to Logan so I passed it up. I wouldn't stay here (sorry guys) if this were a family trip due to the room size, but if you're a business traveller on the go, or a couple looking for a cool place to stay for a Boston getaway, the Charlesmark could be your home for a few days. They sure treat you like family. Cool places nearby - Bukawski's, Uno, lenox, Whiskeys, ust to name a few. Hope this helps and that the good folks over there read this stuff too.

The main purpose of my trip to Boston was shopping, and the location of the Charlesmark in the Back Bay neighborhood, just a block off Newbury and close to Copley Place, was ideal. Additionally, the T stop just down the street made getting around the rest of the city very easy. The price was also at least $100 cheaper than anything else I was able to find in the neighborhood. Other reviewers have raved about the friendly and attentive staff, but unfortunately this was not my experience. I arrived a couple hours before the check-in time, and my room was not yet ready, which I was expecting. I think the guy manning the desk was the same another review described as indifferent, and I agree; he wasn't exactly rude, but he also wasn't very helpful. Anyway, when I came back later close to the official check-in time, my room was ready, and my bags had already been brought up. By then, someone new was at the desk to actually check me in, and she was much more pleasant but still did not give me any information about the room, hotel, etc. For example, had I not read here that breakfast was provided in the lobby, I never would have known, as she didn't tell me and nothing in the \"Guest Information\" in the room mentioned it (and it was served in the upper lobby, tucked away from the elevator and flow of traffic). I overheard another guest checking in later during my stay, and she got a full spiel about breakfast, internet, etc. Also, during my four-day stay, I could hardly get anyone at the desk to look up, much less say hello, during my various comings and goings. I had a room on the sixth floor, and the view out the big windows was actually quite nice. The room was quite small by American standards but perfect for my needs (and not unexpected after reading previous reviews here). The DirectTV and radio were nice, as was the complimentary water. Overall, though, the room I had could use some TLC. The carpet in the bedroom was loose along one wall, especially outside the bathroom door, and caused me to catch my toe a time or two. A light bulb was out in the bathroom (and was not replaced during my stay), and a dial on the wall that I assume was volume control for the sound system didn't work. The room had a cordless phone, but the battery in the handset needed replacement, meaning all calls had to be quick to avoid being cut off when the battery died. The hotel also had free wireless internet access, but the signal was so weak in my room that it was essentially useless. And oddly, the room had a folding chair (not sure why) in the closet/cupboard but no suitcase stand, which would have been much more convenient than the floor. Other small things would really make a big difference: replace the thin blanket and bedspread with a nice duvet. Get rid of the VCR (who needs it when there's DirectTV?), and replace the old TV with an LCD on a swing arm to make the awkwardly high position more easy to adjust and view. Add a programmable thermostat so that the fan isn't constantly running. Keep a better eye on the breakfast room so that things are well stocked and the tables aren't dirty and full of trash. Overall, the hotel was good but not great. It really is so close to being fantastic that the small things (and unfortunately there were many that really added up) took away from what could have been a perfect experience.

Noticeably noisy throughout the day, particularly in the morning and evening rush hour times. The room interior had high ceilings, and was sparsely furnished with light wood accents. There was no closet but instead a mini-clothesrack. There was an iron with a miniature ironing board in the room. The work desk area is a pullout shelf but is decently lit. There is a folding chair tucked away in the the mini-closet area for seating. The mini-fridge is restocked daily with 2 complimentary bottles of water; don't plan on keeping any food in the mini-fridge as it barely has room for the two bottles of water.

We arrived early in the day and they let us check in early. It's true that the rooms are on the small side, but I found the space to be more than ample for just me. The room had a queen sized bed and a small pull out sofa. My bathroom was smaller because I was next to the elevator, but I was very happy with the slate tile and the large shower stall. My co-worker's bathroom was about 3X the size of mine, and he had a bathtub, but the trade off was that I had 2 huge windows overlooking the Boston Public Library while he had a window to the alley.

I love city noise, so I wasn't disturbed being right on busy Boylston St., but if you're not used to nighttime city noise, it might take some getting used to! I think one thing that we all loved was that the room is wired with surround sound and besides the Direct TV channels, it also has all of the music channels, so showering with music playing was a big hit for all of us!

It's steps from the nearest T stop, a short walk to Boston Common and Public Garden, a block off fashionable Newbury Street, and surrounded by great restaurants and bars. We found Boston to be a very walkable city, and the Charlesmark was a great home base from which to explore. Reservations: Found it a little annoying that you couldn't check rates or availability online, but I received a very prompt reply to my e-mail inquiry. Called to get some more information and book the room and almost decided to stay somewhere else after talking to a guy who was very abrupt, bordering on rude. I don't think I was asking stupid questions -- maybe he was just having a bad day. I requested a queen room facing Boylston instead of the \"residential view\" of the alley, but was told there was only one queen room left and it had \"no view.\" Well, points for honesty. Made the reservation for $189/night (no AAA discounts available, though it claims so in the AAA guide) and called back a week or so before arrival to see if any other rooms had opened up. Spoke to a very polite, friendly woman on the phone who said nothing else had. After reading comments here, I was concerned that our 2nd floor room (203) might be noisy if it was located over the bar, but was assured that shouldn't be an issue. Perhaps that was more of an issue when there was a lounge area upstairs. Arrival: Pulled up in front to unload. There was no one to help with bags, but we didn't need it. I was checked in by what sounded like the same delightful guy I talked to on the phone the first time, and he wasn't in a much better mood. It seemed like I was pulling him away from some important Internet research. But he got us our keys without too much trouble and gave me directions to Hertz to drop off my rental car, so that was nice. Room: Our queen room was small, as advertised, but well-designed and not at all claustrophobic-feeling like some hotel rooms in Europe. As promised, there was no view, except of two large air conditioning units, and the room was quiet... and dark. That may bother some, but a dark, quiet, cozy room was just what we wanted after several long days, and nights, out in the city. We weren't there much during the day, except for a nap. At first the sound of the air conditioning units was kind of annoying, but it soon became rather soothing, like white noise. If you want a bright, airy room with more of a view, request the rooms next to ours (201/202?) that have HUGE picture windows looking out onto Boylston. I think that used to be a lounge area. Noise might be more of an issue there, though. I liked the fact that the decor was not the cookie-cutter stuff you find in most chain hotels. Some aspects of the room were a little worn (bedspread, carpet, etc), but overall the room was in good shape and everything worked as intended. I also appreciated the little extras like bottled water in the mini-fridge (which was replenished daily,) the Boston guidebook in the room, the satellite radio and TV complete with a speaker in the bathroom, and the great rainfall shower tiled in really nice stone that felt great on the feet. The small couch was nice and the desk functional enough if you needed it. Nice large, full-length mirror. No full closet in our room, though it seemed like some or the other queen rooms might have had one. Housekeeping was good. The rest of the place: I appreciated not being nickeled and dimed for things like breakfast (a perfectly adequate spread of bagels, dunkin donuts, fruit, coffee juice and tea), local phone calls (I can't beleive some chains charge for this!), high-speed internet access with printer, bottled water, etc. All were included with the room. The bar downstairs served good drinks and seemed very popular at happy hour. It was a great place to begin or end the night. They store your bags for free at check out, though they're just lined up in the bar area (which is closed), but didn't seem all that secure. Service: I think this is the one area with some room for improvement. Unfortunately, most of my interaction with the Charlesmark staff was with the same guy I spoke to the first time I called. He definitely didn't exude the \"genuine, warm and intimate\" service promised on the Charlesmark Web site. I'm hoping he was just a bad seed. The housekeeping staff seemed very friendly. Overall, the service just seemed a little cold -- it didn't ruin our stay by any means, but a smile would have been nice once in a while. I'm afraid the snide, dismissive management responses that are posted here will only serve to bolster that perception. Even if a guest has a stupid complaint, customer service rules usually dictate that you try to be gracious in your response, not belittling. Overall, a great value to stay at a unique hotel in a perfect location. I'd definitely reccomend it as long as you have realistic expectations.", "Date": "July 21, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Denver, CO", "Title": "\u201cReally, really overrated\u201d", "Author": "ingrdo", "ReviewID": "UR8207165", "Content": "After reading reviews on tripadvisor, in magazines, Boston's Best of...about the Charlesmark, I decided to book it. I think this place and its staff have let the reviews go to their collective head. For paying $198 per night, I expected a lot more in terms of customer service. When I walked in, there were three people behind the 2.5 foot long front desk. Two continued their personal conversation and the third person looked at me with no interest whatsoever. There was no \"How may I help you?\". No \"good afternoon\". No nada. When I asked for help with our bags, one young man followed me out to the car and watched as I unloaded the bags. It took over one-half hour for our bags to make it to our room. Although there was an apology offered for it taking so long, it was given while the offeror was on his cellphone in the midst of a personal conversation. This was not a good sign. None of the three staff we had regular contact with would engage in a conversation without being prompted, no \"good morning\", etc. The carpets did not appear to have been vaccumed either in the halls or our room in several days. Again, not for essentially $200 a night. There are some positives: The interior design is great, there is one bartender named Jefferson who I'd recommend to anyone, the location is perfect (however, any downtown hotel is strategically located for business/tourist travel), the disorganization and general inattention to detail got us a couple glasses of Pinot Noir and appetizers for free. That wasn't the intention, however. When I checked out, I was told that everything was taken care of. I reminded the person at the desk that we had two nights of a bar tab charged to our room. She looked at me, said, \"Well, that's a separate system and he (not sure who) isn't here right now.\" Twenty minutes later one of the staff said, \"Your charge is $10 but I'm having a hard time printing it.\" In the next ten minutes, he walked by me four times and did not address me. While we were double parked and loading our car ourselves, I ran back in and asked that the bill be mailed to me. BTW, our bill should have been about $50 so I'm apparently as confused as they are.

Warning: If you require a tub and are not handicapped, you will be sent to the rooms on the floor where the hotel restaurant's bathroom, laundry, and vending machines are located. Not visually appealing! 2) The hallways are narrow and the carpet (outside the rooms) is stained and worn. The elevator has seen better days; I usually took the stairs. Overall, the hotel's appearance is slightly shabby. I do not refer to the rooms but to the lobby and hallways. 3) The staff is a mixed lot. There are those who are helpful and those who are not. You will know them when you meet them. Bottom line: I stayed at the Inn at Harvard (lovely) after I left the Charlesmark. The difference in rooms, lobby, and atmosphere is stunning.

Having read some TravelAdvisor complaints about noise, I requested quiet accommodations on a high floor, which I found perfectly serene. Room # 607, on the top floor (the 6th), was a sunny corner space with charming rooftop views through two double (essentially four) windows. Though there was a central heating+A/C system, the windows could also be opened (which I consider a welcome option in this era of hermetically sealed hotels). Queen-sized beds are available here, but since I was traveling solo, I went for the slightly better-priced Full-sized one. My room had a comfortable mattress and nice materials throughout -- blond-wood cabinetry and a bathroom with real slate and glass tiles, and a spacious, glass-doored shower. There was also a TV wth an impressive range of cable stations, including premium movie channels, plus a stereo + DVD player with a list of free movies you could borrow from the front desk. Though these accommodations didn't offer a full-height closet, the place was designed with care and the precision of ship's quarters with drawers under the bed and good wall hooks for clothing, etc. All vey well thought out. Hardly a palatial room, it felt homey, with plenty of space to move around (not one of those places where you barely have a few inches around the bed!). The breakfast was a do-it-yourself affair with fresh fruit (apples, oranges, bananas), bagels of all sorts, fresh muffins, good coffee, tea, orange juice, instant oatmeal -- that sort of thing. My only complaint: As the weather had just changed abruptly from unseasonably warm to outright arctic, my room was a bit chilly for the first part of the night. I suspect it simply took a while for the heating system to fully kick in. (And a corner room tends to be colder, even though the windows were double-glazed.)

Although not terribly annoying, it was there (and in fairness, the hotel can do nothing about this). \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2The heating system is hot air and was quite noisy, even on low. The hotel could do something about this. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like a hot bedroom so turned off the heating at night but woke later feeling very cold (well, it was -5C outside). I went in search of extra bedding but there was none, so I ended up turning on the heating. I was only staying one night and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sure the hotel would have offered me additional bedding had I asked for it.

Our (little) room was SO comfortable and just big enough for two. We had one of the rooms with the double beds and were impressed with how economically space was used.

I was looking to stay somewhere centrally located, relatively inexpensive, and above all, memorable. The Charlesmark delivered in all of these areas. First, as others have noted, the location can't be beat. From the Charlesmark, if you walk at a decent pace, it's 30 seconds to a T stop, 45 seconds to the Boston Public Library, 3 minutes to the Trinity Church, Copley Plaza, or Newbury Street, and 5 minutes or so to the Boston Public Garden. BTW, the Parish Cafe (361 Boylston St.) had maybe the best sandwiches I've ever had in my life. Second, it's relatively cheap. $129 for the regular room, and $30 more for a slightly larger room. We stayed in a regular room on the top (6th) floor, but took a peek into one of the larger rooms while it was being cleaned. If you're extremely claustrophobic, maybe you'll want to get the larger room, but otherwise, you should probably save your money. Third, it was memorable. When we first opened the door to the room, my impression was \"My god, this room is small\". But as we unpacked, and I started discovering the nice little touches around the room that make the absolute optimally-efficient use of the limited amount of space, I became more and more impressed. For example, most hotels I've stayed at have had a big dresser and a closet. Here, there were drawers that were concealed at the bottom of the foot of the platform-style bed, and sets of drawers to the sides of the headboard of the bed. There's a cabinet in the bottom of the AV-unit where you can hang clothes, and places to hang coats behind the door. The AV-unit also had a cabinet perfectly sized to hold a large carry-on bag, and a space at the top for a suitcase. Dimming lamps folded against the headboard of the platform bed. Also, there was a huge (7 ft or so tall by 4 ft wide) mirror against the wall, next to the window, creating the illusion of more space. Now, I'm a city-dweller writing from a relatively small condo in the heart of a city, so the Charlesmark hit a number of my sweet spots as far as preferences. In fact, I'm impressed with the layout and use of space to the point that I'm going to try to steal some of the elements of their design for my own place. However, I can see how someone with different tastes might feel a bit cramped in a Charlesmark room. If having a hotel room large enough to throw a football around in is your thing, then you'd probably be better off somewhere else. But if you want somewhere that's well-located, relatively cheap, and memorable, you might want to try the Charlesmark.", "Date": "December 4, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "boston", "Title": "\u201cAlways our favorite or a getaway in Boston!\u201d", "Author": "scubagurls", "ReviewID": "UR6308617", "Content": "Modern, very cool rooms.

We couldn't reserve a block of rooms because of the hotel size, so, we just had everyone call. Last June we had a great guy who offered to walk us around, show us rooms, etc. He sold us. Then came October... A few nights before checking in we swung by to check on our reservation. The kid behind the desk was initially less then helpful. When I asked if it was possible for all of the girls to be on one floor and the guys to be on another, he exhaled and said that it would be a real problem and we should have notified him earlier. When we noticed that some of our wedding party members hadn't made reservations, I said that we would call them and have them confirm. The kid behind the desk mis-heard us to say that we wanted him to call and confirm our reservations and responded with, \"That would be an absolute hassle for me to call everyone...\" which I immediately had to correct him to say that _we_ were going to call our friends. He seemed relieved. After asking for something else and getting denied, I left wondering if it was too late to go somewhere else. (By the time we checked in, the girls all did end up on the same floor with the guys on the two floors above) We checked in on the Wed before our Sat wedding. That's when we met Ingrid. She was the absolute shining star. She came to the rescue when our inquiries of \"can we have a late checkout on the day of the wedding\" were answered with (by someone else) \"I don't know that that's possible with a plethora of reasons why not.\" Ingrid said \"not to worry, she'll make it happen.\" Anytime anyone in our wedding party needed anything at all, she was there to help. Every one in the wedding party (even those who weren't able to get in because they were full) loved her. Unfortunately so did the Head of Human Resources at Tiffany's who's hired her for bigger and better things. Anyway, aside from the remaining staff, the hotel itself is quite nice. The bar area and lounge behind the bar are great. There's also free internet which is wonderful. The regular sized room is a bit small with only a half size closet. The refrigerator is only large enough for 2 bottles of water. We had to plug ours in only to find it unplugged by house keeping later. Normally we don't need a lot of space, so, a room that size is fine. We didn't find the drawers in the room until we left (they're under the bed). The double room is a better bet if you're rooming up with friends. There is a breakfast put out - donuts, bagels, water, and coffee. Although we didn't have time to hang out at the bar, all of our friends did and really loved it. It was definitely hopping at night. Overall I would recommend staying here if you don't normally talk to the front desk anyway. That is, if you're low maintenance. We usually are, but, due to the wedding we had a few more needs then the average customer. I know without a doubt if it wasn't for Ingrid, we would have been a lot worse off.

The room itself was on the small side, but they made the most out of the space with an oversized mirror and shelves. There was a large flat screen tv with DirecTV, a stereo and a DVD player. The room was clean and my window happened to look out onto Boylston so I had a fantastic view of the public library and the entire Copley Square area. The staff was extremely polite and helpful.

With the green line T stop right out your door, you can get to any other part of the city (Boston College, Harvard, the airport) with ease. I would recommend this hotel to anyone who likes boutique hotels -- this is not a roomy, luxurious chain-hotel room. It's modern, minimalist, and stylish, with small rooms and a funky feel to it.

There is also inside lounge with a projector tv and two computers for hotel guests (with a printer as well). The continental breakfast consists of Dunkin Donut bagels and muffins, juice and coffee.

Calvin, Kyle, and Dolores -- the staff members on hand during our stay -- spared nothing to satisfy us. They were friendly, helpful, kind, and accommodating. Our room was tastefully decorated with the latest modern fashions in bedding and accessories. This included a full stereo with CD player, a large television, a cordless phone, cool clock radio, and a miniature (tiny) refrigerator stocked with COMPLIMENTARY bottled water. I almost forgot to mention that they also included a DK Boston guidebook. Even the towels at this place were nice; thick, clean-smelling, new. We all liked the tiled bathroom and the HOT water in the shower. The three of us particularly enjoyed our breakfasts here. We helped ourselves to instant oatmeal, fresh fruit, Dunkin' Donuts goodies, bagels, orange juice, coffee, and hot chocolate. We dined with other hotel guests in the area used nightly as a lounge. It doubled comfortably as breakfast seating while CNN aired on the large-screen television. One of my favorite features of this hotel was the complimentary high-speed Internet access. We were able to check our email, print boarding passes, and take care of any other personal business using the two computers available to guests. Though none of us had laptops with us, we saw others taking advantage of their free wireless Internet access in the lounge. The bar in the lobby of the Charlesmark is something of a spectacle. As a young person, I can say it added to the appeal of the hotel, but I can easily see why my mother wasn't particularly fond of it. Though the bar was quite full at nighttime, we were not at all bothered by its patrons or the din of them enjoying their evenings. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone who was travelling to Boston without children. Single people in the 20 - 40 year old range will most certainly enjoy a stay here.

Many of the hotels in the areas surrounding the colleges and universities tend to hike their prices up a bit and many of the 'affordable' hotels are often booked early. In the past we have stayed at the Fairmont Copley, the Hyatt in Cambridge, Marriott and others. The price of the Charlesmark was about $100 less than any of those for this same weekend so we decided to give it a try. So here is my review - the good and the not so good. 1. Location is great. It was raining most of the weekend but it is only about 50 yards to the T stop. The hotel is also an easy walk to just about any type of store or restaurant you could need. 2. Hotel Staff: We only met a couple members of the staff the entire time we were there and both were friendly. 3. Our room: Here is where the hotel looses points. From what I've gathered after re-reading all of the prior reviews, we were probably in one of the least desirable rooms of the hotel. Even though we payed extra ($249/ night before taxes) for a 'premium' room, our room was a dark, musty smelling room in the basement with no windows to the outside. The windows that were in the room looked out onto a hallway and have bars on them. Not only does this seem like a fire hazard to me (I asked and this would be a violation in Virginia) but the light from the hallway seeped in thru the shades and made for a miserable nights sleep. On the plus side, the room was very clean. 4. Miscellaneous: The hotel makes a big deal about offering 'hundreds of TV channels including movie channels' and bottled water, however out of those hundreds of channels probably less than a dozen actually came in focus. The bottled water is a nice touch but for water drinkers like my husband and myself, 2 small bottles doesn't go very far. Neither was a big deal for us because we are not TV watchers and I didn't mind walking around the corner to the grocery store to buy my own water. Would I stay here again? Not at $249 a night for a basement room. My sister stayed at a bed and breakfast on Beacon Street for about $100 a night the same weekend. No it was not as close to a T stop and no it was not as new & clean feeling but it was a large 4th floor room with real working windows and a refrigerator in the room. If choosing the Charlesmark, ask to not be in a room in the basement and remember, part of what you are paying for is the location. A few blocks further from a T stop will probably save you a hundred dollars a night.", "Date": "October 17, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Singapore", "Title": "\u201cGreat location and shower!\u201d", "Author": "saidean", "ReviewID": "UR4024905", "Content": "After a 24 hour flight/transit/lack of sleep, we really valued the wonderfully *powerful* hot shower that Charlesmark hotel provided. The room is a tad on the small side, but considering that we spent most of our time outside the hotel running around Back Bay (extremely convenient from the hotel) and neighbouring shopping centres (eg Prudential), we hardly found the size of the room a problem. The staff were helpful and the room had little additions that point to it being a boutique hotel - mini hifi/cd player, metal plated light switches (that dims the light the longer you touch the plate etc), a nice big stand-alone mirror, complimentary mineral waters etc. The bathroom had a sizeable shower 'cubicle' which was big enough for 2 (compared to other B&Bs we stayed in New England, this was a plus). Did I mention that the shower was nice, hot and powerful? lol A big plus after suffering a 24 hour flight when you just want to wash down all that stiffness and tiredness.

The Hotel is nice, compact and has good facilites. yes the rooms are small and we had one of the delux rooms I think the standard room would have been too small but they were comfortable and as others have mentioned they have a very good sound system and televison system. Our only gripes would be that our room was facing the main road and the windows are not sound proof at all and this kept us awake till late and them woke us up quite early and we were on the top floor! Also we were staying during snow and very cold weather and even with the heating on full in our room we couldn't get warm! Saying all this we would stay again mostly due to the location and the value for money", "Date": "February 6, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney, Australia", "Title": "\u201cGreat Gadgets, Excellent Location\u201d", "Author": "Looseal", "ReviewID": "UR3103458", "Content": "We stayed in this hotel last week, simply as the reviews on Tripadvisor were so good, and we were not dissapointed. The location is superb and the hotel staff were so helpful. Agreed the rooms are compact but they are stylishly decorated and the technology within such a small space is unheard of in many of the hotels that I have stayed in. The price is great value for money and the breakfast a refreshing change in a country where you usually have to pay extra. I would stay there myself again and will recommend it to everyone.", "Date": "February 1, 2005"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Charlesmark Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g60745-d225873-Reviews-Charlesmark_Hotel-Boston_Massachusetts.html", "Price": "$189 - $275*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">655 Boylston St</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Boston</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">MA</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">02116</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "225873", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/7d/21/7d211c33ed362ee52a8952bf3dc6a0981large.jpg"}}
