The included breakfast materials (4 different cereal packets, 4 little fruit tubs, 4 bits of bread, 4 * 600ml milks and assorted spreads) actually managed to make almost everyone happy.

Restaurants, cafes, public transportation, chinatown, QVB, park, etc. everything you'd want is within short walking distance. And yet, surprsingly, it was not as loud or as busy as some of the other main streets. 2) Family friendly. When I was doing my research on hotels I found that most of the hotels in Sydney only allow two people to a room. Some allow three. There were only a handful which allowed a family of four or five to be in one decent size room. Hyde Park Inn also had what I really needed in terms of bed configuration - a double (or queen, I can't recall) for my husband and I and a single for each of the kids. 3) Breakfast and kitchen supplies. We liked having breakfast supplied in our own kitchen so we can have it whenever we choose to. It was simple but adequate. The microwave was great because when the kids were too tired to go out, we brought food back to them and they could warm it up. 4) Staff. Helpful and friendly. And now for the not so great points: 1) Bedding linen. Old and shabby coverlet, not very clean looking. Extra sheet over blankets would be nice. 2) Bathroom. Shower stall should be renovated. No proper shampoo, just a kind of liquid soap for body and hair. 3) Hot water. It runs out if you are in the family rooms because each unit comes with its own hot water heater.

The location is excellent for getting to most places in the CBD and it has the added benefit of being directly opposite the Museum Station in Hyde Park, This is a station for the train to the airport. Although the train is an outrageous $15 a ticket, and it has no facilities for luggage, it is still the best way to ad from the airport, especially during peak hour traffic. Try to get a room as high as possible in the hotel. This will help reduce the street noise - which is a factor here - and you will get a good view over Hyde Park and what a real estate agent would describe as \"harbor glimpses\".

There is internet but it is slow. There are no in-house dining facilities. The price does include bread, yoghurt and juice for breakfast.

Breakfast consists of orange juice, diced peaches and pears, slices of bread, butter, peanut butter, jelly, milk, cereals, cookies, etc. It is very nice and tasty! The beds were comfortable and we could sleep well at night. It was a little bit noisy, since the hotel is on Elizabeth St, which is a major street in the Sydney city area. We were in the 6th floor, so we could hear the cars. But nothing uncomfortable. Nobody complained about it, and we could still sleep well. Housekeeping is reasonably good.

I spent ages trying to look for a hotel in the Sydney CBD which not only catered for large families but was also friendly on the pocket. After an extensive internet search and with the help of Trip Advisor, we settled on the Hyde Park Inn. I have a family of 5 and we stayed in a Family Deluxe room on the 9th floor which consisted of a queen bed and 3 singles. Our balcony looked over looked the beautiful Hyde Park. The room contained a kitchenette, bathroom and all the usual mod cons. Just be aware though that all the beds are located in the one room so if you want your privacy, you would be better off booking a family suite. A continental breakfast is supplied in your room free of charge each day. The cost per night was great @ $242 for the 5 of us which was by far the cheapest I could find, especially for a 4 star hotel in the heart of Sydney. A few tips...... Transport: We flew in from Melbourne and caught the train from the Airport to Museum Station which is located across the road from the Hotel....This was expensive! It costs $20 per adult & $10 per child, a total of $70 for my family. We ended up booking a private maxi cab through the hotel on return to the Airport and it only cost us $50. Apart from the Airport train, I must say that Sydney has a great public transport system. Buses arrive/depart frequently every 3 -5 minutes. The bus stops are located on either side of the road and close to the Hotel. The 555 bus is free which takes you around the CBD to Sydney Harbour and the ferry service. The mono rail is within easy walking distance to the Hotel with the World Square stop only a 2 minute walk. Attractions: Darling Harbour is a comfortable 10 - 15 minute walk or you can go by mono rail. A good food court which is relatively cheap is located there. China Town is a 10 minute walk. Paddy's Market a 15 minute walk and you can also take the mono rail there. Sydney Harbour a 20 - 25 minute walk. I suggest a bus if you want to give walking a miss or catch the ferry from Darling Harbour. Shopping: Well you're pretty much right in the city centre. Try the World Square, Westfield Shopping Centre (which is a bit more upmarket that the Melbourne stores), plus the many malls. Overall, my family thoroughly enjoyed the Hyde Park Inn and the Sydney experience. We would return again to this Hotel because of the cost and great location.

The room we had was on the 7th floor; it was a large room with a double and single bed, a small kitchenette and a dining table. I think most rooms have a balcony and these look out onto a road and then past that, Hyde Park. The room and bathroom were both clean and the kitchen had most basic requirements to make simple meals, or eat take-out in the room. A basic breakfast of a couple of pieces of bread and some cereal is provided each day to the room for the following day. Right outside the hotel there is a free 555 bus that you can get on that loops round the whole city very regularly - this was very useful. The only negative to the overall value of this hotel was the noise level. The hotel is right next to a very busy road, the traffic is very loud until about 2-3am with buses, taxis etc. It is quiet between 3-5am and then starts again with the daily commuters for work. The windows offer NO noise reduction at all, and we really struggled to sleep without ear plugs (which aren't provided).

And with the little kitchenette and the mini-breakfast provided, we were able to save some money on food and eat healthy instead of eating out all the time. Coming from Canada, Australia is very expensive! If you turn right exiting the hotel, the pasta place is right at the corner. Another good (inexpensive) place to shop for food is Woolworths. There is a free \"green\" bus that stops just outside the hotel which will take you directly to Sydney Harbour, but it is a nice walk if you decide to walk at least one way.

If you're travelling on a budget, the small kitchen would come in handy and you can buy all your needs from the 7-11 (about 50 metres down the road). For cheaper supplies, try Woolworths on the corner of Park & George St (opposite the Town Hall). If your looking for a cheap feed, the Pasta take-away shop on the corner of Liverpool & Elizabeth St had a huge slab of Lasagne (amongst many other choices) which fed both of us for AU$7.50 ... also, if you like good coffee, get a large size take-away from one of the 3 or 4 coffee shops closeby, drink half (store the remainder in the refrigerator) and heat the rest in the microwave the next morning for breakfast. It's not as good as fresh, but it beats that powdered stuff anyday.

We were looking at all the reviews on this site and were tempted by the boutique hotels at Potts Point but finally settled on a 'safer' area which was more central as well. Hyde Park Inn had some decent reviews and an easy to use website with an enquiry system that was quick to respond. Together with the reply, they offered us a discount/ free upgrade. I called the hotel to give credit card details (they offer the option of email or call..). At first they quoted the standard price but after referring them to our enquiry +discount + guest name, they gave us the same offer discount! :) The hotel itself was very clean and bright. Maximum score for location - just opposite Hyde Park and a short walk to the shopping streets of George and Pitt. If you wear good shoes, there's not a problem walking all the way to Circular Quay and Darling Harbour. In the other direction, Surry Hills is about a 10 min walk away. The central train station was about 10 minutes walk as well - saved us a train transfer (from Museum, just across the street from the hotel) to the Blue Mountains (Katoomba) Our room was decently sized and spacious - seems odd though, there are no twin bed rooms, ours was with one queen and one single bed (perhaps family oriented? changing bed size was not available). We had a tiny kitchenette with a rather measly breakfast every morning (delivered in the fridge the night before) - two slices of bread + Jam/ butter + 2 cookies + milk + youghurt. Not very much but we managed to stay slightly satisfied. The counter staff were mostly friendly 2 ladies in particular were very helpful in making and altering our reservations for dinner and lunch. Hyde Park Inn had its fair share of unfriendly and unhelpful counter staff though but that didn't spoil our trip too badly. We tried to book tickets to Wicked, but they almost refused to help us call the hotline or check online. Depends on your luck who's on duty. Another lady helped us call 3 different numbers to make a reservation for dinner. Internet is charged at a ridiculous hourly rate if you want to access it from your hotel room, but they have a 'business centre' which has 3-4 computers with internet access - daily rate of about $6 AUD. You need to get to the counter to ask them to unlock the business office for you though. The hotel has a restaurant next door to it but we weren't particularly attracted to it. Each room has a order-in directory with a ton of options, albeit abit overpriced, which we used one lazy night. I'd recommend takeaway from a proper food outlet if you haven't got the energy to go out. Great place to stay for friends or family. Next time I return though, I'd look for somewhere abit cheaper.

The hotel is located next to Hyde Park, and is in a great spot as it's within walking distance of many attractions such as Sydney Tower, Darling Harbour and Paddy's Markets and the Chinese Gardens. There is also a train station and a bus stop right outside, and the monorail is accessible only a couple of blocks away. We had a room facing Hyde Park on the 9th floor, and despite what some reviewers have said, we did not find traffic noise to be a problem. The room was very spacious, clean and modern, and included a kitchenette and bathroom. The hotel has free parking (many Sydney hotels charge a nightly rate), although as some reviewers have indicated, the parking is very tight. Nevertheless, as most things are within walking distance, we were able to leave the car in the garage for the duration of our stay in Sydney. Another great feature of the hotel is that they provide a laundry for the use of guests. This is free and was just what we needed after a week on the road. On the downside, the bed did tend to sag in the middle a little, but it wasn't too bad compared to some hotel beds we slept on during our roadtrip. Otherwise, we were impressed with the quality and spaciousness of the room. Each day, Hyde Park Inn provides a continental breakfast and newspaper for guests. We found this was a great feature and enabled us to save quite alot of money over the course of our stay. While the breakfast consisting of 2 pieces of toast, fruit juice, cereal and a tub of diced fruit was adequate, we suplemented it with some food from the nearby supermarket to add a little variety. There are heaps of restaurants and other shops within a very short walking distance. The staff were professional and courteous, although they didn't bowl us over with warmth or hospitality. All in all, Hyde Park Inn provides great value for money. You wouldn't normally expect to find a hotel in such a great location that provides breakfast and a newspaper for such an affordable price.

I enquired about multiple rooms and was shown through the property by one of the friendly front of house staff before we made our booking (for ten rooms including both self contained apartments) and was offered a group discount rate without having to ask which made the booking process very manageable. The staff we dealt with at the front of house, in back office mangement and service were all very hospitable and friendly through our entire experience with them and did their best to accommodate our sometimes difficult needs. We checked in in the early afternoon and my bridesmaids and I were shown to one of the two bedroom apartments at the rear of the building. This room didn't have any windows (just a panel of glass bricks to let light in from outside) but we knew that when we booked and that is the only criticism I have - it was clean, comfortable and incredibly spacious (all much appreciated the following day where there were four of us plus make up artists, hairdressers and various family riff raff coming and going for several hours!). Being set at the rear of the building, it was also very quiet - much appreciated on the Saturday evening before my wedding! Although the Hyde Park Inn is an independent hotel the apartment layout and facilities were comparable to the Saville which is just down the road - although the rate we got at Hyde Park was about a hundred dollars a night cheaper. The rest of my extended family were staying in a variety of rooms from deluxe double rooms through to the standard family rooms with extra beds for children, and everyone found the place to be a great point from which to explore the city area. Many of them had cars and although there was a charge for parking and some of them had to park in a Hotel-owned facility further down the road because their 4WDs were too high to drive into the carpark attached to the hotel, they found the rates reasonable and access quite easy. The location of this hotel is excellent - right across from Hyde Park, as the name suggests, and within 100m walk of Museum station where you can get trains to and from the airport as well as around the CBD to take you down to Circular Quay - or you can walk, it's about twenty minutes away. It's also an easy walk to Darling Harbour (about five to ten minutes depending on your pace!) and a quick stroll up to the nightlife of Oxford Street and Kings Cross (fifteen minutes away). Despite its central location the street it is on is not rowdy at night (unlike those a block or two west) so it's quite safe for families. There's an Italian restaurant attached to the hotel but to accommodate the sometimes puerile culinary tastes of my extended family, at the recommendation of one of the FOH staff we walked down to the Crown Hotel on the corner of Elizabeth and Goulburn Streets and had a fancied-up pub meal in their upstairs dining room instead, which was great (for their tastebuds and mine and my parent's stress levels). All in all the Hyde Park Inn delivers service, value and a great location in spades. It's not a fancy hotel, but it ticks all the boxes for Sydney visitors seeking a spacious, self-contained retreat from the hustle and bustle of the CBD.

However, the rooms were always quiet enough at night and we had no trouble sleeping. It was interesting to go out on to the balcony and see the stream of traffic and people moving through the street day and night.

I would not call the Hyde Park Inn a budget hotel. There are other cheaper hotels within a few blocks but the ones we have stayed at are not nearly as nice and charge extra for parking. This is a good mid-range property with a lower mid range rate compared to other hotels in the area. The location is excellent. It feels more like a very nice motel (I think they are really serviced appartments) rather than a hotel, but we were very comfortable, didnt need anything overly fancy, and had no major complaints at all. We had a deluxe studio room on the 15th floor facing the park. The room was furnished with one queen and one single bed. It was clean, not huge but big enough and nicely appointed with a small kitchen, Air Con and satellite TV. Basic breakfast supplied and parking available as part of the room rate (this must be prebooked as spaces are limited). Other budget hotels charge extra for parking, so if you have a car, the Hyde Park Inn offers even better value. Staff were very friendly and helpful. Have been reports about traffic noise at this property, but given the excellent location right down town, Im afraid it comes with the territory to some degree in this price range. We did not find it to be much of a problem. It may help to stay as high in the building as possible, but we have found that all the properties we have stayed at in this area have the same problem to some degree or another. Fortunately for us, we can usually manage not to notice traffic noise too much. If you are on a very tight budget and not too bothered with a few extras, and dont need parking, then the Hyde Park Inn is probably not a good choice, as it is better than a budget hotel and likely to be a bit out of your price range. (Try the YWCA or Travelodge Wentworth in the same general area...the Hyde Park Plaza is a gamble and parts of it are tired looking). However, if you dont mind paying a little more than a budget rate, if you like a great location, in a nice place, with a few extras (like car parking included in the rate, etc) without breaking the bank, then the Hyde Park Inn may suit you.

I decided to go with Hyde Park Inn which was $AUD192.50 a night for triple share as the location and quality seemed better from the reviews that I read. The great thing about Sydney is the airport is not too far away from the city, so it didn't cost that much for a cab to/from the hotel. The hotel is centrally located in the CBD and when we arrived, they upgraded us from the triple share room to the family studio for no extra charge! (The front desk staff looked at the 3 of us with all our luggage and decided we deserved a bigger room! How lovely). The family studio was awesome, a balcony overlooking the lovely green Hyde Park, a fully equipped kitchenette with stove, microwave, and cooking utensils and comfy bathroom. We had a nice big TV, plenty of space, and 3 beds; a double and two singles. We also had a big sofa which was probably a bed made to look like a sofa, so it could've been a bed comfortably. So a family of five could've fit nicely with no problems. There was a 7-Eleven just outside the hotel (you don't even need to cross a street) so we bought eggs and cooked ourselves breakfast in the morning. Also they give you a free breakfast but they actually stock it in your room so you don't need to go down to their restaurant to dine! They provided milk, juice, bread slices, cereal and your basic tea and coffee all in the comfort of your own room! Some relatives came to visit us in our room and we ordered pizza in and had plenty of space to fit everyone in. We even had a little dining table in our room. Location was excellent, right in the middle of the city and facing the lovely park. We walked everywhere we needed to get to, there are public payphones and bus stops just in front of the hotel, and lots of places to eat. Staff weren't the most friendly but honestly we loved Sydney and our room too much to notice! Their internet service seemed a bit expensive when we asked about their in-room rates, so they recommended their cheaper option which was to go to their business centre and use the internet there (if I'm not mistaken it was about $AUD5 per session at the business centre). Connection speed was great, you can use one of their computers in the business centre or plug your own laptop in. They also had a printer if you needed to use one. Obviously we were so happy to receive the upgrade, but it still was the most expensive hotel we stayed at throughout our trip (Our trip lasted 17 days, we stayed at 3 locations in Queensland and one in Melbourne, all at an average of AUD$165 a night). Nevertheless, it WAS the nicest hotel we stayed at throughout our trip.

Sitting there eating my brekky, reading the paper and looking at that amazing view was my favourite part of each day. I asked for a room that was on a high floor (after reading on here about street noise) which they gave me. So noise was not an issue. You can still here the city rumbling below you (remember though that you are staying in the middle of Australia's largest and busiest city) but with the door to the balcony shut I could hardly hear any noise at all. The view from the balcony is excellent and I spent quite alot of time out there watching the goings on of the city below me. This is a very central hotel to the city. \"Museum\" railway station is right across the road so getting around is very easy. You could even just cross the road and walk through Hyde Park into the city in no time at all. I bought a \"Daytripper\" travel pass from the railway station for $16 AUS which gives you unlimited travel on trains, buses and ferries for the day which was great value and means there is no where in the city you can't get to. The room has a brand new LCD TV with all the local TV stations plus cable stations Sky News, BBC news, Fox 8, History channel and a couple of sport channels. They also have 2 free movie channels with movies playing 24hrs which is great. This hotel is fantastic value for money. With added extras that other hotels charge you big bucks for.

The room was air conditioned and had a small balcony. The street noise can be a bit loud, so we opted for air conditioning on and balcony door closed. However, a great view looking over Hyde Park was very nice. A light continental breakfast ( and morning paper) was supplied daily to our room and was more than enough to start the day. As the room was equipted with cooking facilities we could have made a hot breakfast. The staff were very helpful and always had a smile when coming and going from the hotel. As far as location goes, it was perfect.. A 5 minutt walk to Pitt St. 15 min walk to Circular Key, 1 min to bus and train stations. Internet cafe just around the corner. An added bonus was that we were able to park the car in their under building car park at no extra cost. Would highly recommend this hotel for families and will definately be going back.", "Date": "January 12, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Canberra", "Title": "\u201cExcellent hotel\u201d", "Author": "sportygalaus", "ReviewID": "UR11234942", "Content": "Fantastic, clean, convenient hotel that provides extras that all other city hotels charge big dollars for. We had a family room (1 queen and 2 singles) and it included a kitechenette, flat screen TV, air con, big bathroom and very comfy beds. Parking was already booked out so we were given a voucher to park at the marriott across the road and it was free - very rare in Sydney city. Location is fantastic. We were in Sydney to see a show at the Opera House and as this hotel is directly across the road from the Museum train station, we caught the train to Circular Quay. Took max 5 minutes and cost $3.60. Price included a light continental breakfast that consisted of bread, cereals, juices and tinned fruits. The only thing I could fault this hotel on would be the noise. Elizabeth St is very busy, especially in the mornings with all the buses so best to keep your balcony door closed and take ear plugs if you are particularly sensitive to noise at night.", "Date": "December 4, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oakland, California", "Title": "\u201cPleasent Stay\u201d", "Author": "eonnee", "ReviewID": "UR10996509", "Content": "Positives: The rooms are very large and clean. They come with kitchenettes which include a stove, microwave and a fridge. In the fridge there are complimentary juices, package fruits and bread for breakfast. There are also forks, spoons, plates, frying pans and a water steamer for tea. The view is very nice. The bathroom is also clean and comes with all the proper things. You are also alloted a parking space if you have a car (I do not recommend driving in Sydney). The beds are very comfortable. The hotel is very \"homey\". It is a comfortable place to stay in. The desk clerks do not really bother you but say hello and smile when you walk in. Also included is a flat screen T.V.. There are a lot of channels, but what I liked the most is the \"Box Office\" channel that offered new movies that are on DVD for free. I was sick for a day and a half during this trip, so the movies really made me feel at home. The hotel is very centrally located to the subway (on same block or across the street) that connects you to all the main attractions. On the same block there is also a a bus stop that connects you with all the main buses that can take you all over the city. There is a also a Seven-Eleven store two doors towards Liverpool street where you can buy inexpensive dinners (noodles, beef pies) and bus/subway tickets (I suggest buying the \"Red Ticket\", you can use this ticket for a week on all the subways and buses that are in the Sydney Area but won't work on the Ferries). It is also two blocks from the Monorail, two blocks from the Spanish Corrider, a block from China Town and across from Hyde Park. Also included is air condition. Negatives: The hotel is on a major street (Elizabeth Street) which can get quite noisy during the day. If you close your door to the balcony, your room becomes very quiet. The hotel offers Internet Via Ethernet wire (no wireless) for 22 Aus dollars a day. I bought it for two days because I was sick but around the corner on Liverpool Street there is a internet shop that offers internet for 1 hour for 3 Aus. Dollars. Other then that, I had a great stay. Very Central Location. Very comfortable and \"Homey\". Sidney is a very \"Metro\" City and quite busy. I suggest heading North for day trips to Manly or going taking bus rides and getting lost in the outer Sydney. I hope you have a great time! Oh, if you are heading to this hotel from the Airport, just take the green line towards the city and get off on Museum Station and your at the hotel.", "Date": "November 23, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne, Australia", "Title": "\u201cTake your ear plugs\u201d", "Author": "tongi", "ReviewID": "UR10435597", "Content": "Stayed for a long weekend in a deluxe room. The fairly spacious room was renovated in neutral tones - but not sure about the bathroom, although it was fine (shower only). There was a kitchenette. The problem was NOISE. Sydney is a bus town and the hotel is on a MAJOR BUS ROUTE, so from early in the morning there is traffic noise, which made taking in the view of the park from the balcony unpleasant (we were six floors up) at any time except late at night. On our final morning (a Monday) there was hammering and banging from 8am on the floor directly above us, which made staying in our room and having a leisurely light (and they really do mean \"light\") breakfast impossible. When we phoned reception and made the (quite reasonable) request that the noise/vibration should cease until after checkout time their response was that the website says there are renovations going on. What it actually says is: \"As this is a soft refurbishment disruption to guests should be minimal. Working on one floor at a time this work will be finished in late 2007\" - not sure what they define as \"minimal\". It was a small thing, but I had a blister sore on my heel and got a bit of blood on the bedsheet, which wasn't changed. Not a big deal, but it shows lack of attention to detail. Otherwise, the location is good (in CBD and close to Oxford St) and there's coffee opposite in an outdoor park cafe, which you'll probably need after the (lack of) breakfast.", "Date": "October 29, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Australia", "Title": "\u201cdisapointing...will give HPI a miss next time\u201d", "Author": "bored1985", "ReviewID": "UR8467539", "Content": "Have been trying to get down to sydney for ages...Hyde Park Inn kept saying they had no rooms left.

We were given a family room with a queen and 2 singles. Becos the cot was a \"playpen\" type, we decided to join the 2 single beds and put our baby to sleep in it. The room was one of the recently refurbished ones and had a great view of Hyde Park. The kitchenette really came in handy for us as we needed to sterilise bottles and prepare baby food. Staff were always friendly, greeting us and our baby. They also provided useful information on how to get to places. We could walk to most places in the city and other places were just a short bus-ride away. You can buy bus tickets at the 7-11 shop next door.
