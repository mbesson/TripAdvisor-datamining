While I didn't call the front desk(I was traveling alone, and a call to maintenance at 4am was not what I needed to do), I did mention this upon checkout. The temp in my room was around 60degrees the morning I left. The front desk clerk's response to my concern was \"well, sometimes people get hot, and so we turn off the main heat, so your unit in the room was just blowing cold air.\" I advised how cold it got, and that I could understand that during in between temps might warrant a cooler room, but this was BOSTON, in WINTER, and couldn't folks in rooms that were warm simply turn down their heat? There are individual heating units in rooms for a reason. Don't get me wrong....my stay was marvelous, and folks were very friendly, but no heat? I would just be aware of it during the winter months.

This was my first stay and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll definitely return. This is a boutique hotel and a nice change from the corporate behemoth across the street. The property is also a nice change from the usual Courtyard \u00e2\u20ac\u0153feel\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd because it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not standard in any way. I was pleased that my room did not have the standard under the window Courtyard air-conditioning unit that blows too hard. The Courtyard Copley Square has the air-conditioning in ducts that are above head, which kept the room comfortable. I liked that I could open the windows about three inches, which allowed for fresh air to come into the room. My room faced another building, which provided additional quiet and privacy. The room was very quiet for the three days of my stay. Other reviews note the advantageous location. I walked pretty much everywhere I needed to go, including over to Cambridge for appointments. When I wanted to take the T, I walked a few blocks to Copley Station. Added conveniences include a nearby Shaw\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s supermarket, where I bought fresh foods, two drugstores, and many area restaurants. One night I met friends for a pint at the Irish pub around the corner where we sat at a table on the sidewalk. Many reviewers complain about the size of the rooms. The rooms are small compared to most hotels in the U.S. I consider my room on the 7th floor to be standard for European hotels, and many hotels in New York City. However, I was comfortable as a single person. I imagine that it would be a tight fit for a couple. The workspace was really nice and well lit. My room came with a comically over-sized flat-screen television. It was like being in a screening room, when compared to the size of the room. There are drawbacks that are not deal-breakers, but worth noting. The lighting in my room did not extend to the entry, which is where the thermostat for the air-conditioning is located. Since I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t travel with a flashlight, I had to use my cell phone to shine light on the thermostat in order to manage room temperature. The big annoyance was the Internet speed. Internet is included in the room rate, but it was painfully slow. At times, plugging directly to Ethernet worked better than wireless. That was not, however, always the case. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not a heavy data user, but even simple browser tasks just wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work at particular times. One other annoyance was that the advertised room rate that I book included \u00e2\u20ac\u0153breakfast for two.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd However, when I got my breakfast certificates they were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153breakfast for one.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The problem was that, based on the advertised rate, I invited a business colleague to meet me for breakfast. Instead of fighting it, I made alternate plans elsewhere. This hotel keeps a coffee and tea station in the lobby only in the morning. Most Courtyards have coffee and tea available throughout the day, which is a nice feature. I heard other guests asking about that on my first afternoon at the hotel. The desk agent referred the guest to the packet in his room. It would seem that providing coffee throughout the day would be a convenience that the hotel management would see as valuable to business customers. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m surprised that this feature has been overlooked. Most of the desk staff people were warm and inviting. The restaurant staff were particularly friendly and warm. Staff were readily accessible and easy to find because the hotel is small. I arrived very late so I called ahead from a connecting airport. Information on my arrival was properly relayed to the person attending the desk and I was expected when I arrived. That was a nice touch after a long day of connecting travel from the west coast. I chose to stay at the Courtyard Copley Square because of the favorable rate I got on Marriott\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s website.

We have stayed several times at the sister Marriott Copley Place hotel, the large conference-type regular Marriott hotel, just across the street. The Courtyard Copley Square is a much smaller, cozier, friendlier hotel, also less expensive. It is a great value, considering the cost of hotel rooms in Boston, one of the priciest cities for hotels in the country. The Courtyard Copley Sqaure reminds us of a true European-type hotel experience. The hotel does not have a dining room that offers lunch and dinner. The rooms are on the smaller side than you might find in other larger hotel chains, but the location can't be beat! Flat screen TV is nice, although it is not in HD. Our room was very clean with a god-sized, marble bathroom. Breakfast in their small but very nice breakfast room includes options for a good buffet or individual orders (worth the extra money), all made in their kitchen and not like the tasteless \"free breakfasts\" that are offered in many places (which we don't like and usually pass up). Several of Boston's BEST restaurants are within 1-2 blocks walking distance, plus the best shopping experience just across the street, including all the high-end shops, Tiffany, Saks Fifth Avenue, Lord & Taylor, Eileen Fisher, etc, plus a great Barnes & Noble, all within short walking distance and all located so that you don't need to go outdoors, especially good in the winter. Newbury Street and Boylston Street are just 1-2 blocks away, with many excellent boutiques and art galleries. The \"T\" subway stop is very close by. The Theatre District is about a 1 mile walk away, if you are going to the Theatre. Go for a drink in the Oak Room in the nearby Fairmont Copley Place Hotel (a Boston luxury), just a block away.

We were staying on Marriott Rewards points, and it was available, so we went for it for a night before moving across town to another hotel. The Courtyard is located in an historic restored apartment building, called 88 Exeter. We were a little bit confused when we first arrived, because all of the signage directly in front of the hotel entrance says 88 Exeter, rather than Courtyard by Marriott. We figured out we were in the correct place quickly enough once we looked up and saw the Courtyard sign. Just be aware, this hotel is also referred to as 88 Exeter. The location of the hotel is only about 1 block from Copley Square, and right in the thick of a nice area with lots of other hotels, restaurants, and shopping within a couple of blocks, like the Copley Place mall, Prudential Center, and departure point for different tours like the popular duck tours. There is a Lord & Taylor directly across the street, as well as a Shaw\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s supermarket, which found was helpful for picking up some snacks. Nearby restaurants include many chains, like California Pizza Kitchen, Uno, Cheesecake Factory, and PF Chang\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, as well as Dunkin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Donuts and Starbucks for coffee. There didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t appear to be too many independent restaurants nearby, but we really didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t walk too far away from the hotel. The area around the hotel is very nice, tourist-friendly, and safe. We arrived at the hotel around noon and were able to check-into our room with 2 queen beds. The lobby in the hotel is a bit awkward, probably due to the architectural constraints of the building. The front desk is right there when you walk in, with the rest of the lobby, or library, as the front desk staff referred to it, in a room attached. The library room includes one computer with internet access, as well as several seating areas. One odd thing we noticed in the lobby was a padlocked refrigerator of alcohol that sits in the empty lobby area near the front desk. It seemed a bit odd and tacky to have that sitting in the lobby the way it was, and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not sure why it was there. When checking us in, front desk staff was efficient, but definitely lacking in friendliness. Each time you walk into the hotel, you have to walk right past the front desk, since it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s right by the elevators and front door, but never once did the front desk staff greet us in the few times we went in and out. There wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a real sense of welcoming at this hotel. I would think this would be a priority at a hotel that is trying to brand itself as a boutique version of Courtyard by Marriott. Our room was located on the top floor, which I believe is the 10th. Since it is a relatively small hotel, there are only about 7 or 8 rooms on each floor. Our room was located on the end of our floor, which meant it was a very nice size! The room was oddly shaped, and had interesting walls that curved up to the ceiling, which gave it some character. The room had an open foyer area right when we walked in, with a table and a bit of open space, which we found to be good for storing our luggage. The room was otherwise a standard Courtyard room, with the typical bedding and d\u00c3\u00a9cor. The area beyond the foyer seemed larger than a typical room, probably because of the odd shape. Everything was very clean and in good condition. The tv looked like it was recently replaced with a new flat screen. We had a fine view across to the shopping areas by Copley Place. The bathroom was also relatively large, although not very upgraded. It was a bit stripped down looking, without any upscale fixtures. However, it was just fine for our night, and standard for a Courtyard. Overall, the room was very comfortable and quite large for a city hotel room. I have the feeling every room in this hotel is different. Our room was also very quiet, and there is free internet via an Ethernet connection. One small complaint I had was that the desk area wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t overly functional for working. The desk chair was too low for comfortable working on the desk, and the tv took up a bunch of space that would otherwise be good desk space. The room also had a small refrigerator in it, although it didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get overly cold. Parking at the hotel is $42 per night, and the valets were not always around. When we first arrived, we had to request that the car be taken, but later in the night, when we got our car out, there was a valet available. They were very responsive when they were around. When we needed a taxi, there were none right by the hotel, and it would have been helpful to have a valet there to call one for us. Overall, we enjoyed our stay at this hotel. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not generally a fan of the Courtyard chain, but we gave it a chance, and it impressed me. The boutique-ish style of it and interesting room made it unique. I only wish the hotel could let the unique building and all of its character stand out more. The hotel has been made a bit modern and up-to-date, to conform to the standard Courtyard look. I wish they were able to decorate the hotel more in keeping with the style of the building. I would also have liked a friendlier staff to make us feel more welcome in the hotel. Otherwise, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s good. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in a very nice location for touring Boston, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s clean and comfortable. It was a great value for us, using points. The rooms were going for around $250 per night when we were there. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not sure if it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s really worth this much. I know hotels in Boston are pricey, but I think you may be able to find something slightly better for that price point. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a solid choice, but it definitely lacks any real luxury and grandeur if that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re looking for. I think with a couple small changes, the hotel could have it all.", "Date": "July 26, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "new jersey", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel for the value\u201d", "Author": "lc1113", "ReviewID": "UR71752469", "Content": "We were in Boston for the 4th of July weekend.

You won't have any.\u201d", "Author": "raggail", "ReviewID": "UR36398283", "Content": "I've written several reviews for Trip Advisor and use Trip Advisor for planning where to stay. I always look for two things when reading reviews--the date the person stayed and the objectivity of the review. In all of my reviews, I've had wonderful experiences; however, our experience here was so awful that not only did we speak with the manager, but the manager gave us one of our two nights for free. Let me explain: When we arrived, the front desk and valet were exceptionally wonderful. Absolutely marvelous, I cannot say enough nice things about them. After traveling for several days with few clean clothes left, I decided to wash some clothes while my boyfriend slept. The one washer and dryer available were a nice touch, but I cringe to think what would happen should more than one person want to wash clothes. Plus, the room is so small and so hot and musty that I actually had problems breathing. No worries, as I didn't plan to be in there long. I went to take a shower while my clothes were washing; the shower, even after many, many minutes of running, had no hot water. Lukewarm would be a generous description. Also, there were small flying bugs, only a few that seemed to come from the drain mind you, but I do not pay additional occupancy for bugs in my room. I thought that perhaps the hot water situation would be remedied the next day and went to put my clothes in the dryer. After the proper amount of time and while using the provided available wireless Internet in the lobby, I returned to fold my clothes. That would have been possible, had the one dryer not been so old and used so much that my clothes apparently pushed against the door and had quit drying some time ago. Again, no problem. I used every available space to hang clothes in the room so they could dry, since I had no intention of spending additional time in the small closet of a hot washroom to make sure the dryer worked as it should have. The rooms are tiny, by the way--comfortable enough for two people, but definitely small. The next morning, my boyfriend went to take a never-warm shower; this time, he did call the front desk and alert them to the situation. The clerk reported the problem and a maintenance person did come immediately, which we were thrilled with, especially for a Sunday morning. After running the water for a while, he explained that there had been problems with the pipes and to run the water for a half-hour until it warmed up. After a full day of touring on the trolly, a wonderful experience where you can get on and off the trolly at certain stops and stay as long as you like with the added bonus of wonderful drivers who are very knowledgeable, I wanted nothing more than a cold drink while my boyfriend rested. I bought a beer from the small fridge and had to ask the front staff to open the bottle, since I don't carry a bottle opener on my person. One of the staff made mention that he \"never drink[s]\" and was not able, as in didn't know how to, open my bottle. What someone does in his own time is his own business but that wasn't professional in the least. When I later bought another beer to take upstairs for my boyfriend, the other clerk said that it seemed I had already bought enough; perhaps she was joking but again, someone who is spending that kind of money for a room deserves a little less judgmental conversation. The next day, after again being woken by the room next door making quite loud noise (I think it was more the people in the room than the room itself, since the dad was yelling at his kids at 6 a.m. Lovely, yes?), my boyfriend again tried to take a shower. He let the water run for 45 minutes before finally just taking a cold shower. I would almost attribute the coldness of the shower to so many people taxing the system, except I took a shower at 10 a.m. and it was still cold. I didn't notice any bugs this time, fortunately. We packed our stuff, said thank you to the housekeeping staff who were working hard and did a good job of keeping the place clean and left. How do I know the housekeeping staff kept the place clean? There was a vacuum cleaner parked half the day before in front of our elevator, right across from our room. It seemed more of a safety issue than anything, but it wasn't bothersome if you don't have children, bags, or anything in your hand and don't mind going around or moving a vacuum cleaner. We told the front desk clerk about our issues and asked to speak to the manager; the desk clerk was wonderful and professional and even made small talk while we waited for the manager. She also mentioned that someone before us had made the exact same complaints--no hot water and bugs in the shower--about a room on the same floor. We spoke with the manager and politely explained what had happened, where he finally did take off one night's stay. By the way, there are breakfast vouchers allowed in the mornings for a hot breakfast; steer clear if you can, though. It's not that great and I'm still waiting on my second cup of coffee. The kitchen staff seemed nice; the \"hostess\" seemed a little stressed by the six people in the room. The valet was absolutely wonderful and very helpful, and one front desk clerk with the Irish accent (I'm so sorry I didn't get your name) was so helpful and willing to give us tips about things to do. I wish it had been a better stay and I wish I had better things to say; this was our last stop on a beautiful trip and had it not been for the city of Boston and the tour, the entire Boston trip would have been spoiled.", "Date": "August 1, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mount Airy, MD", "Title": "\u201cPersonality Plus\u201d", "Author": "LaxnFH", "ReviewID": "UR35973703", "Content": "I recently stayed here while taking my daughter for college orientation.

We stayed just for one night. We were in town for sightseeing, shopping and to go to a Red Sox game at Fenway. I chose this hotel because it was cheaper than the other options and seemed to be in a great location. We took the T from the airport and were able to find the hotel easily. It is about 3 blocks from the green line so it was convenient to the T. We arrived around 10am. I had requested early check-in when I made my reservation. No rooms were available when I arrived. They stored our luggage and we returned around 3:30 and got our room. I requested a room on a high floor but was placed on the 4th floor. Our room was TINY! If I was traveling with someone other than my boyfriend, we would have had to switch rooms. It was even a little cramped with my boyfriend. If I was alone, it would have been fine. We had a king size bed that was almost pushed up against the windows. There was a small space to walk sideways between the bed and the windows. The TV was on the side wall so you had to lay sideways in the bed to see the TV and the person on the far side could barely see the TV. The bathroom was across from the bed about a foot away so if someone turned the light on in the bathroom while someone was sleeping, it was a bother. It appears that this hotel was not a hotel at one point so I think probably all the rooms are different sizes. We were in a corner room near the elevator, which we never heard. Also, there was no view. We overlooked a building and an alley. I will say the good points of the room was that it was very clean, the bathroom was a good size, we had plenty of towels and toiletries and the TV had a lot of channels. The bed was really comfortable, but I have yet to meet a Marriott bed that I did not like. We didn't complain about anything because we were only in the room to sleep and shower. I would have requested a different room if we were there for longer. Both of the employees we encountered at the front desk and valet were really nice and helpful. They gave great directions. The hotel offered complimentary cookies upon check-in, and also complimentary snacks and beverages prior to the Red Sox game, which I think might be prior to every Red Sox home game. They also had a computer and printer which we were able to use for free to print our boarding passes. The location of the hotel is the best part about it. It's in the Copley Square area. It's across the street from Prudential Center and the Boston Duck Tours, which I also recommend. It's around the corner from a large 24 hour supermarket. It's two blocks from the heart of Newbury Street. It's a long walk to Fenway Park, but doable. The weather was nice and we don't mind walking so we walked to Fenway and back. It's an easy walk, a straight shot. The subway can also be taken there. There was signs at the parking garage across from the hotel advertising Red Sox parking. I don't think there's many hotels closer to Fenway anyways. We walked back from Fenway around 11pm and felt safe. The hotel is in an area with a ton of other hotels and it was nice. We did not eat at the hotel's restaurant but I looked at their breakfast menu. it was small but reasonably priced. Just a block away is Boylston St where there is a ton of bars and restaurants. Check-out was fine, no complaints. They stored our luggage until we left at 7pm with no problem. I would stay at this hotel again if I wanted to stay in this area again.
