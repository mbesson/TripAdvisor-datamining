{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Outdated, needs renovation We have spent 3 nights at the Gromada Hotel am Tegeler See in June 2008 and have been disappointed.The building dates from the 70ties, an so does the interior. Everything appears worn and old. Beds are the worst. Rooms are untidy and seem dirty. (Ants in the shower is not what you'd like to find there.)Breakfast is mediocre, prepared with little care. But at least there is some variety to choose from.The location is far from the city centre, although the subway station is just a 10 minute walk away. Subways run until 0:30 on weekdays, so no problem with that.We certainly would not stay a second time here.", "Date": "Jun 15, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR181173897", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "acm0"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187323-d543585-r16942613-Gromada_Hotel_AM_Tegeler_See-Berlin.html", "HotelID": "543585", "Price": "$95"}}
