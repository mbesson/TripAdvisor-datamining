It is not walking distance from the historical center, but just a few blocks from Piazza Euclide and an easy subway ride or taxi ride to central Rome. The quality of the hotel, the size of the rooms, the politeness of the staff easily makes up for it. The Suites costs about what you would pay for a room in central Rome and are well worth it. The restaurant provides a fair breakfast. I would not recommend it for lunch or dinner as there are far better eating establishments an easy walking distance. By the way, for families, the suites have a living room area with couches that open into beds.

The 'Degli Aranci' sits in a posh, quiet, residential area (worth noting that in the same street there are at least 4 embassies, including Switzerland). So you'll feel at home, if you are willing to live a little bit aside from the crowds, you don't mind walking or using public transportation (by the way in this regard the 'Degli Aranci' is very well located: several different bus lines and one of the main tramway lines are within couple of minutes' walk, and they take you to all major attractions of Rome or to Termini station if you prefer). Now about the main point: this is a VERY BASIC place to stay. Really, it boggles my mind, how on Earth it scored 4 stars. The rooms (we rented 2...) are small, and most of furniture and bathroom fittings saw better times and probably haven't been changed in the past 5 or 10 years. It all feels worn (however, the beds are still sufficiently comfortable). My most dramatic complaint is with the breakfast. I haven't experienced such bad selection ever. The choice is limited to some sweet pastry (not tasty, very fat and veeeeeeery sweet), some mediocre yoghurts, appalling fruit salad (basically it's nothing but chopped pineapple and chopped peach - both straight out of a can), some wheat buns, bad cheese, bad salami and very bad ham. Even to get a proper espresso you need to ask the waiters, because the available machine produces a liquid not worthy of being called coffee. Enough of the bad. For the good I can say two things: rooms and the whole place are very clean (despite the \"worn feeling\"), and staff are super friendly and helpful. Especially at the front desk. If you consciously choose this place as your selected staying option, weigh the cons and pros. It's equally easy to like this place and to hate it.", "Date": "September 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Newry, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cpleasant stay\u201d", "Author": "isabelbarbedo", "ReviewID": "UR117014588", "Content": "very clean and staff very nice. our room had a balcony and it was spacious.
