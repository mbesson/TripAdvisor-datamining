It isn't just a shuttle to and from the airport like so many others--this FREE shuttle goes to area attractions and runs constantly throughout the day. There are scheduled times and you do need to sign up the day before, but the hotel is remarkably flexible and will work with you if you need service at random times (a definite benefit when relying on the often unpredictable Amtrak arrival schedule). The location IS a little ways away from some of the more notable attractions (Space Needle, etc), but the shuttle eliminates that problem. And frankly, with Seattle traffic being absolutely horrific and the only drawback to an otherwise beautiful city, I strongly recommend that you take advantage of the shuttle and leave your car in the hotel parking lot. The amenities are very nice. The hotel rooms are comfortable, clean, and modern. The fitness center is convenient, and the guest laundry? Don't let the term \"coin laundry\" on the hotel's website fool you--both the washers and driers are 100% free. Beyond that, this hotel does try harder than places in similar or more expensive price ranges. I came into Seattle with a severely pinched nerve in my neck--it was so painful that I could barely lift my luggage getting off the train. By chance, I happened to mention it to the front desk clerk just to see if he had any local advice--within 30 seconds he was on the phone to a local chiropractor and masseuse setting up my appointment and saving my vacation in the process.

Still looks like an old motel, where you park your vehicle in front of the room. Nice effort on sprucing it up though. I liked the lobby's fancy lighting behind the desk clerk. Kind of interesting that the same swirly pattern was in the elevator. Still looked like an old elevator, but it was a nice touch. The rooms are accessed via walkways that on a windy day would leave you pretty wet, they must work their butt off if it gets icy out. The room was exactly what I was looking for since I was there to take a 5 hr test at a testing center. It was clean, the bed was comfortable, and I enjoyed using the big desk-like table that was part of the room. It had nice access for plugging my laptop in, etc. It smelled like old BO, when I first went in, but that rapidly cleared up when I fired up the AC. I masked it myself with some popcorn. I like it when they have a microwave in the room. Tub had a big gouge in it, and the tub faucet dripped, but I didn't notice until the AM. Still, a very clean bathroom. I was overall pleased with the room/hotel. It was old, but they have tried hard. The other options in the immediate area didn't look that great on tripadvisor.

I was a little annoyed to find that there were no grassy areas for our dog to potty in, only mulch/dirt and rocks, but they claim to be a pet-friendly hotel, etc. The other thing I found very annoying was that they placed a $25/day pre-charge on our credit card. When I called and asked about it, I was told that they do this mostly on holiday weekends, etc. This should have been made very clear before booking, or at time of check in.

I could find nothing in the downtown or Seattle Center areas under $450 per night (apparently there was a very large convention in town and they had all the rooms booked). I was therefore left to look outside the downtown/Lake Union/Seattle Center core. Our usual places to stay when coming into Seattle overnight are Silver Cloud Stadium (pricey, but fun rooftop pool), Marqueen (love, love, love it here), Holiday Inn Express near Space Needle (cookie cutter hotel, but convenient), Silver Cloud Lake Union (great breakfast area - like a huge living room overlooking marina), Paramount (great to stay if taking in a show at Paramount Theatre and we love the Dragonfish Restaurant), Watertown by the university etc. I only mention these so you know what kind of places we customarily stay. Now for the Nexus.... hmmm... we upgraded to a \"suite\" for an additioinal $50, since there were 4 of us (2 adults, a teen and a tween). One room contained the living area and sparse kitchen, the other room contained 2 queen beds. Everything in the room seemed clean, but I was still leary of the couch and carpet. The beds were comfortable and the bath area was clean. There was 2 robes provided (didn't use them) and enough towels which were fluffy and clean. The place still has the \"motel\" feel to it even though they've tried to spiff it up a bit. Maybe the Nexus should do away with their shuttle and they would get better ratings...this is where things were both good, then a bit bad for us. You can reserve the shuttle up to 24 hours prior to your arrival and I was very impressed when a desk clerk called me on Thursday morning at my home to verify our Friday afternoon check in and shuttle reservations to go to Safeco Field for Friday's game. Great! Off to a good start. We checked in and verified our shuttle to the game. We were in lobby ahead of time and loaded up in the 11 passenger van (plus one seat for the driver) The driver was dismayed that there were reservations for 12 passengers and we, of course, couldn't all fit. ... so after a bit of time, we changed vans and headed onto I-5 stopped traffic (I completely understand that traffic is not the hotel's fault) but when we eventually got to the ballpark area, the driver seemed lost and made a series of rights and lefts - we could see the stadium , we just couldn't get there. He eventually dropped us in a parking lot about 3 or 4 blocks from the stadium - no problem, we walked... only now it is getting really close to game time, and we had hoped to be there an hour or so early. The biggest glitch with the shuttle is that we were (unknown to us) SUPPOSED TO SCHEDULE THE RIDE BACK TO THE HOTEL AS WELL. Well, the shuttle reservations for the ride back were full, so we ended up paying $30+ tip for cab from Safeco to Nexus. I suppose it is my fault for neglecting to confirm, but I assumed the shuttle service was ROUND TRIP.- so my tip is to reserve both legs of your shuttle at the time of reservation. Breakfast was drearily bad the next morning. We got to the breakfast room about 1/2 hour before it was due to close and they were out of many items. No eggs, bacon crumbs only in floating grease etc. But the worst part was how dirty the whole breakfast room was. We were told the hotel was completely full the night before - so maybe they just were unprepared for a full hotel eating breakfast... \"Free \" breakfasts can always be a bit \"hit and miss\" so we just took this with a grain of salt. Of note, the closest open place to get a drink once we got back to the hotel after the Mariner's game was The Ram - on the other side of the freeway (5-10 minute? walk), but the walk felt a little unsafe.... the bar and grill on the hotel property closes at 10pm. I'm not sure I'd recommend this place or stay here again. It wasn't creepy horrible, but it wasn't great either.

We decided to spend another day and the hotel had no problem accommodating us. Though we did decide to cab it downtown and back. $20 cab fare each way. Shuttle or cab the hotel is convenient, right off the I-5. We will definitely use this hotel again. It is a little pricey, have had much nicer larger rooms for less.

We had tickets to the Mariners game on Friday night and booked the shuttle 24 hours before the game as the hotel suggested.

We were booked on the return shuttle and were told to meet outside the amtrack station directly after the game (around 1030 pm) We arrived at the spot at 1015. At around 1045 2 vans from the hotel arrived. One of the vans had a rear facing car seat in it for our 4 month old. The driver didnt check the roster and allowed a large group of people that were not scheduled to board the van. The driver refused to ask the people to get of the van and allow us to board. Even though our party was on the list. The driver said another van was coming and left us! 1100pm with a 4 month old baby! We called the front desk and were told by someone who said it was his last night that another shuttle was not coming. That the driver had to drop everyone and come back to get us. Long story short, we didnt arrive back to the hotel until 1245. We were in a seedy part of town, where we had to deal with bums and prostitutes for over 2 hours with our parents in their 60's and our new baby. The kicker is the trip takes about 15 minutes with normal traffic. No excuse for them making us wait! Very disapointed! We will not return! Sidenote-we had no maid serivce our entire 5 days.

The potential is here for a retro \"boutique\" style property; but at the moment it is far from retro, unless the definition of retro is tired and worn with slaps of 60's style colors. It resembles a motor inn and not a hotel style at all. The rooms are very basic: with a crowded sink/microwave/mini-fridge area, old style TV's, very spotty WiFi connections and the old fashioned heater/ac units under the window.The bathroom is small and when we checked into our room, towels and hand soaps were missing. I do have to give kudos to the staff for getting our missing amenities to the room very quickly. While we were there, a group of teens were there for a conference and over two nights, it was ridiculously noisy with running on the outdoor hallways late into the night and van alarms going off at 7am. My sister was a few doors down and was up til 3am listening to a ruckus on the floor above them; she finally went down to the front desk after repeated calls to the desk didn't address the problem. We did use the shuttle to get to Safeco Field and it was great getting there. Coming home, there seemed to be some confusion as to how many were going back, with not enough vans or seats available to porter us back. We stood around while the hotel staff tried to figure it out and finally after about 20 minutes all were accommodated. This shuttle confusion continued the next day when we tried to use the shuttle to get to Pike Place Market. I had put our name in at the front desk about an hour prior to the scheduled departure and when the time came, again the staff seemed confused as to where they would put the people in the couple vans that were going to various places. Had they kept us all updated of what they were trying to do instead of running in and out of the hotel lobby and looking confused, it would have been a lot less aggravating standing in the driveway awaiting some kind of direction. When they asked where we were going and what our room number was, the driver couldn't find it on his clipboard and this seemed to confuse them even more. We finally gave up after waiting 30 minutes and took a cab into Pike Place Market. They really need a more organized method for their shuttles so they could run more efficiently. We decided to cut our stay short by a day and checked out the third morning; the front desk staff did seem slightly apologetic but basically said that the noise they had with the teen group had cost them some business and remarked to me \"I guess we won't be seeing you at this hotel again.\" No, I don't think you will.", "Date": "July 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Riverside, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cTerrible awful service, crappy rooms\u201d", "Author": "Anne987654321", "ReviewID": "UR115307109", "Content": "First, I'll start by saying that I think there may be 2 different Hotel Nexus in Seattle and this review is for the one on Northgate that is not downtown Seattle... This is an overpriced motel. I stayed here because I was in town for the Seattle to Portland bicycle ride, and the Nexus had advertised on the ride's website. They advertised a special rate, shuttle your bags to the start line, etc., etc. Fabulous! After making the initial reservation, any time we called to ask a question about the shuttle or whatever, nobody knew anything about it and told us to call back later. Finally we arrived. The lobby was nice and the staff was ok, but often was so difficult to get an answer to anything. Three of them standing there doing nothing, pretty annoying. The rooms are small and while some things seemed clean, the bedspreads looked old and shabby. The halls and elevators were small and hard to maneuver large luggage through. We got up the morning of the ride. Now, the hotel was full of cyclists and they couldn't bother to put the hot breakfast out a little earlier. They knew all the riders would be gone by the time they usually put it out. We were left with cereal, dry overboiled eggs and bagels. Half my bagel was dry, the other half was soggy. So gross. My friend wanted a photo of us so she asked someone who we think was another guest to take a photo. The man at the desk was apparently offended that she didn't ask him and made some comment. Fine, she handed him her camera. Then he didn't get off his lazy butt to take the photo. Seriously, he just turned his chair and took a crappy shot. WTH? Finally it came time for them to shuttle our bags to the start line. We dropped our bags in the lobby, and when we came back down with our bikes... the bags and shuttle were gone (they weren't supposed to drive us, just our bags). But now we had no idea where to meet the shuttle. We rode on to the start line and hoped for the best. We couldn't find the shuttle. My friend called the hotel. The man who answered was extremely rude (the same one who \"wanted\" to take our photo) and just kept telling her the driver was at the start line. \"He's at the start line.\" \"He's at the Start. Line.\" \"He. is. at. the. start. line.\" It was his only answer. Snottier each time. We tried to explain that there were 10,000 people there and we could not find him. Could he patch us through to the driver? No. Could he call the driver? No. Could he give us the number? No. What is your name? Click. He hung up on us. Several minutes later I called and asked for the manager. I was told she wasn't there. Again I politely tried to get him to help us. He spoke to me like I was the biggest moron in the world for wanting to find my bags. Again, I asked for his name and again he hung up. If you won't give someone your name, and your solution is to hang up on them, you know what you're doing is wrong. Finally, we located the driver. The driver, Dan?, (the only person with a clue at this whole hotel) informed us that he had just spoken to the man at the front desk and that they could have called him.

The comforter had a stain on it in plain sight that looked like seman or some other bodily fluid. Now I always take off the bedspread immediately anyway because I know a lot of hotels do not wash these in between each guest but come on...if there's a stain in plain sight i think you should wash it. Also, I don't even think they wash the blue blanket on the bed because when I saw them cleaning other rooms they did not take away the old blankets and they did not have any clean blue blankets on their carts. The good news is they were changing the sheets at least. The bathroom had strands of hair on the shower walls and on the bathroom floor (wasn't my hair), and all around the ledge of the tile was built up dust. The toilet was also not thoroughly cleaned...the part where the toilet seat and cover is attached to the toilet had some kind of white crud caked on it. Also, the hair dryer had dirt or makeup smeared on the handle, so they obviously do not clean this in between guests either. So, overall I guess it just depends on what your definition of clean is, but this hotel was unacceptable to me. We had room 303 and our other family members had the room next door (to the right from the outside). We paid $100 per room for one night.

There are some good things and some not so good things about this hotel. I chose the hotel primarily for the location and for the fact that they provide a shuttle to the Childrens Hospital (as well as other area hospitals and attractions) where I was visiting. The good things about the location are the proximity to the freeway, and the Northgate mall. Also there is a very good restaurant next door. The bad things about the location are the proximity to the freeway (noisy) and the fact that the hotel is located on a busy road that connects to the freeway. The best thing about the hotel itself was the housekeeping staff. The room was very clean, the housekeepers were friendly and I never woke up to the sound of housekeeping calling to each other or vacuuming next door like I have had in some hotels. In fact, the housekeeping staff were the friendliest people at the hotel. The front desk staff, one in particular, were cold and not so efficient (almost as if they just didnt care) and unfriendly to the point of being rude. I noticed this with all the guests, not just myself. The other not so good things about the hotel was the look from the outside - very like a budget motel, with the rooms on several levels with their entry doors along a corridor on the outside facing the street (which is not always secure) and the outside just had a shabby tired look. One of the most frustrating incidents involved the internet access. The hotel boasts high speed internet in all the rooms. I was able to get online on Thursday but not at all on Friday or Saturday - it seems the hotel was full and the internet was busy and the signal was very weak. It was very frustrating as I was not able to be online again until Sunday morning. The hotel was very noisy, you could hear the guests in all the surrounding rooms, and while this is not the fault of the hotel, I had an upstairs neighbor who paced his floor (my ceiling) ALL NIGHT LONG for both Thursday and Friday night. Overall, I would not recommend this hotel. I was not in one of the premium rooms with the soaker tub however, but for the amenites and room I had here, you could get a room at another hotel for a better price, like an 8 or Motel6.", "Date": "May 4, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle", "Title": "\u201cperfectly fine\u201d", "Author": "SamPatch", "ReviewID": "UR11977150", "Content": "Nothing fancy, but slightly better than some of the usual chain motels.

BUT, the one downside was that the tub is basically right next to the bed. No biggie, just be prepared. We thought it would be in the separate bathroom area, but it wasn't. Also, for some reason, the bathroom wall (shower & toilet) didn't reach completely to the ceiling. Thus, every sound made in the bathroom could be heard in the room. It's not a big deal for couples I guess, but if you're bunking with a friend or family member, just be aware of that! Otherwise, the hotel was nice and clean, service was fine (although after the first night, the cleaning staff took the hotel-provided robes and didn't replace them, and didn't refill the in-room coffee supplies). The continental breakfast at the adjoining restaurant was initially a bonus for us, but it left much to be desired. It consisted of single-serve cereals, toast/englishmuffin/bagels (which you toasted yourself at the end of the buffet, often resulting in a long wait), oatmeal, hard-boiled eggs, a couple of fruit choices, Yoplait yogurt, juice and coffee. After day one, we opted for the Starbucks across the street. OH, one other quick note -- the hotel does have high-speed internet, but only if you have a wireless card. We thought they might have ethernet cables, but there was no option for that, so we had to upload our vacation photos on dial-up. Needless to say, we decided to wait until we got home, and just bought an extra media card for our camera instead!", "Date": "September 8, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "zurich", "Title": "\u201cLoud\u201d", "Author": "Speedy-Vesper", "ReviewID": "UR5691709", "Content": "Front desk personnel were unfriendly and not helpful throughout the stay.

There were a few some pro points about the hotel-near the Northgate Mall and highway on-ramp entrances, free parking and continental breakfasts but the cons over-ruled the pro points. Cons- Check in was messed up with a confirmed reservation for a two double bed room, but front desk told us that they had us for a room with single queen size bed. No bell man to take our baggage to our room. The lobby's single elevator is too small to transport 4 adults with baggages. Room number configuration is confusing-odd number & even number rooms on either side of the building. Strange hotel design-coming out of the elevator where all room doors are exposed to the outside part of the building. Hate to check in this hotel when the temperture is in the 20's-30's. Tiny cramp rooms and out-date furniture- lamp with blue poka dots shade & green plastic swivel chair. Room's only window is fronting tthe corridor preventing privacy. Air conditioning is NOT central air. It's a stand alone a/c unit that is built in the exterior wall under the window. Our a/c unit's control was broken and could only work when the gauge is at the coldest settings. Instead of freezing, we turn the a/c off and slept in a musty but warmer room. The blankets were thin and the bed sheets were stiff, regardless of their claim of upgrading their beds with new Serta beds, our sleep were not restful. The bathroom faucet couldn't give us any warm water when we turned the handle to the middle, it was hot, hot water. The shower head was loose so on our first shower, water sprayed all over the bathroom floor. The name has changed from the Ramada Inn at Northgate to the Nexus, but it's still an out-dated and a budget class hotel that we definitely won't come back to. For a few bucks more, I'd rather stay at a Marriott and enjoy their superior rooms ,service and ameneties. Overall grade for the nexus hotel- D", "Date": "June 28, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Nexus Seattle", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g60878-d124044-Reviews-Hotel_Nexus_Seattle-Seattle_Washington.html", "Price": "$109 - $169*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">2140 N.
