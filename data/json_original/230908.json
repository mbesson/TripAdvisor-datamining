This time was very similar to the last stay. Room was small but clean and safe. Black out shades, great AC (last summer) and great heat (this winter) made for excellent sleep. The bed was the Euro equal to a full/double which would be a bit tight with someone else. The bathroom is proportionate to the room, but what is needed. Last time just a shower and this time a shower/tub with the same room. The hotel staff was very friendly. This time I did have rental car to park. The staff took care of this, but it was around $45 US per day so beware. I would suggest dropping a rental car unless you are using everyday. I did have the hotel breakfast this time, it was very good and average cost by European hotel standards. The TV is a bit rough, but I assume most people do not travel to Europe to watch TV in the hotel. Not much else to say except if you are looking for a very nice basic hotel you this is it. It is in Rembrandt Square which places you central and within walking distance to downown (redlight, train station, etc) and the museum district.

The double beds are actually 2 singles pushed together which is not ideal for a romantic weekend away although they are comfirtable.

If you dont feel like walking though, there is a tram stop (number 9) on Rembrant square which will take you to and from the centre. The Hotel is quiet. Nothing special but a good place to rest your head after a busy day in Amsterdam. Staff are ok. We spoke to some friendly ones and some not so approchable ones. Rooms are slightly on the small side and quite dark with loads of dark wooden furniture. But does the job for a 3 night stay. The bed is very comfy. Sheets & Towells changed every other day but room is cleaned daily (bins changed, etc) There are marks on the carpet/walls and the bath/shower could do with a good scrub but rooms are clean enough.

They have a nice resturant/bar but really you should be out in Amsterdam looking for a bar instead. The front desk is especially helpful. They helped us find a couple of resturants, call cabs, helped with our luggage, etc. Very friendly and always asking if we needed anything. The best part about this hotel is the price of the rooms and what you get for that price. The rooms are very nicely decorated and maintained. The bathrooms are updated and comfortable. We got a room with a view of the canal in front of the hotel and it was great. When we checked into our room, put our luggage down, and opened the window it was beautiful to see the houseboats and the city from your window.

This is standard everywhere and is charged at 5%. Our room was perfect, over looking the river with a great view. The room had all the amenities required. Coffee making facility and blow dryer. Even the shampoo and shower gel is of good quality. Towels were replaced daily. My only tiny moan is that it was slightly cold, however, my partner switched on the air con which is also a heater. Problem solved. The location of the hotel is excellent. You can get a train from the Airport to Central Station and get on #9 Tram which will take you to Rembrandtplein Square, the back entrance of the hotel is on the square. We walked from Central Station as it was a 20 minute walk and there is so much to see as you walk through the city. There is lot's of bars, coffee shops, Cafe's & Restaurants around the hotel and felt very safe. There is a really classy bar in the hotel which also has smoking room. Very smart inside.

One of our group (the friend I was sharing with) arrived earlier than expected and asked to check in - he was given a key pass card to an apartment outside of the hotel. This would have been fine, but the bedroom in the apartment was in disrepair - the skylight blind didn't work and there were no curtains in the bedroom. The beds were really small and not what I would consider being worth the cash spent on the room. The downstairs part of the apartment was nice enough, but a bit of a waste of space really - a kitchenette on the side seemed a bit pointless. The worst point for us though was the apartment we had been given was at the top of 4 flights of very narrow and steep stairs - not ideal at all. After a good look around the appartment we went back into the hotel and asked politely at reception to have a room in the hotel itself. There was no issue and the receptionist gladly gave us our keycards to the new room. This room was much closer to meeting expectation - clean, spacious enough, with a nice ensuite bathroom. No complaints about that at all. Also, I am a very light sleeper, and I have to say that I slept as well as I could in this room - it was on the internal corridor link of the hotel though, so we weren't facing out onto the street which perhaps made it a quieter area of the hotel. I would have rated the hotel a bit higher than I have but for our final parting memory. We had checked out and were waiting in the lobby (free wifi here is a real bonus by the way - as are the desktop pc's free to use and browse the web) - anyway, we were waiting for a friend to check out and one of the bar staff (older woman with shorter hair) asked if we wanted a tea each before leaving. We said we were close to being out of cash and couldn't afford one, but thanked for the offer. The lady made the gesture that she would offer it to us complimentary - so we agreed. She brought the tea (in paper cups) and a biscuit for us each and we proceeded to drink our parting \"gift\". As we got up to leave and made our way to the exit, she followed us saying \"Excuse me, are you going to pay?\". We had made clear that we didn't want to have to afford to buy the Tea's beforehand - Tea's that we were never going to have in the first place, until they were offered gratis. Luckily between us someone could cover the 7 euros 50 for these small teas. It left a rather sour taste (not the tea - the experience). Overall I would say this hotel is located superbly for getting around Amsterdam - we walked most places from here and I would suggest that walking is the best way to get around the city - the trams seem to have a complicated pre-pay scenario for tickets which doesn't make it easy to hop on and hop off. If you are heading further out of the city on the Metro, you can get a 24 hour ticket for 7 euros - this was handy for us as we made two trips to the Amsterdam ArenA on Friday and then again on Saturday. Breakfast wasn't included in our tariff, but the St James' Gate Irish bar in Rembrandtplein just behind the hotel serves an excellent array of breakfasts including veggie one's - and their menu of daytime and evening meals is also excpetional - the portion of fish is one of the largest I've received. Two recommendations in terms of the RLD - if you are heading to Amsterdam for a \"lads trip\" or Stag do - take in the Banana Bar - you will not be disappointed with the experience! A decent sports bar in the RLD is called \"Old Wembley\" - cheapest pints of Heineken in the city I'd say at 4 euros a pop. Heineken experience is also worth doing - though be prepared for a lengthy queue once in the attraction for the \"brew you\" simulation. Don't bother with the World of Ajax Stadium Tour - hardly get to see anything of real interest and don't even get to see the dressing rooms. Van Gogh museum was superb. On this trip I didn't take in Anne Frank House, but I have been there before and it was also amazing. Just a heads up though - we failed to make use of the concierege attraction booking system available at the hotel - if you are planning on taking in any of the sights, I'd suggest using that service as we queued to get into everytyhing we did for at least 20 minutes due to not having pre-bought tickets. There appeared to be no extra cost if tickets were bought on site at the Eden Hotel either, so do make use of this if you can.", "Date": "November 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "virginia", "Title": "\u201cLacks charm, ok for business travelers, card-key light switch is inconvenient, large and impersonal except for nice concierge.\u201d", "Author": "gr8ful47", "ReviewID": "UR120514181", "Content": "First, the good: concierge was excellent and front desk staff was very good.

I was a bit apprehensive as to what to expect but after my short tram ride to rembrandtplein and a two minute walk around the corner i was well impressed by the entrance to the hotel once you enter that wide sliding you enter the long and very impressive hallway , this part of the hotel is apparently a star less than the adjoining hotel but you wouldnt think it . the reception staff were very friendly and although we arrived at the hotel at 0700 we were allowed to book in and leave our luggage in the luggage room . we were told we could try back at around 1100 to see if our room was ready but to no avail but it was ready for around 1300 . The room was on the second floor which was easily accessed by the lift which can only be used with your pass card along with the door to the stairs so the place is quite secure. Our room did not have a canal view but that did not matter as we were not planning on staying in much . The room was relatively big plenty of room to move around . the bathroom was very clean and tiled all over with scented soaps at the sink and shower and there was a bath . Our rear window looked out onto a fire exit and the windows of the other Eden , but not a problem . there was also a tv on the wall facing the bed ( no tea or coffe ) only in the superior rooms . the bed which was two singles joined together was very big and comfy we slept in every day and never got disturbed by the cleaners just leave the reminder on the door handle to let them know.. we didnt eat the breakfast or dinner there as it is expensive but the smell in the morning was great. there is a quiet bar in the main hallway which is reasonably priced , and when that closes we were invited into the adjoining eden where there was a piano bar open until 0400 and was very entertaining although very pricey , great service though as you are taken to your seat and served all night with your bill presented at the end . After a long day out walking we came back to find our room cleaned and towels changed every day with handkerchief box and tissues all topped up (great service) At check out our flight was in the evening but the concierge was happy for us to leave our luggage with them for as long as we had to . Also he was very helpfull with travel tips on how to get around as we had to get to the Arena for a concert . the hotel is very well situated for the ten minute walk to anywhere in the city , just a short walk around the corner to rembrandtplien where the bars are open till 0200 during the week and you can sit and chill out in the afternoon with a coffee or beer watching the locals on the bikes or the street entertainers , very clean and safe area . another short walk across the bridge to waterlooplein where there is a daily market and if you venture further on to the quayside there is a walkway around the area which takes you back into the main city use all the little side streets as you may miss out on some little surprises . Amsterdam is a beautifull city with lots to see we walked everywhere from out hotel the longest walk was to Ann franks house which was about fifteen minutes but everything is easy to find with the map gifted to you by the hotel . One piece of advice if you are going with kids , read the street signs as you walk around as everytime we went walking we always ended up back in the red light district all roads seem to lead to there ( a must see ) not to seedy , we went to see it during day and at night . still very busy in day time . didnt manage to get into ann franks house or the royal place due to the long qeues , so make sure you are up early to get in any of those places .

The stairway and halls very poorly decorated so by now we were fairly sure we were in for an unpleasant experience when we opened the door to our room. And we were right! The room was disgusting. I'm not sure whether this was staff accommodation or a student squat either way it was not fit for purpose. The furniture was damaged and badly warn. I wish we had stopped to take photos before leaving but the smell was unbearable. There was a \"No smoking\" sign on the door but it was clear that people had been smoking in the room recently. We left the room and began our decent to ground level simmering with anger. Upon reaching reception I demanded that we were given the room we booked. They were reluctant but eventually agreed. They however made no apology for trying to put us in that room or they distress they had caused. The room we were eventually given was of an acceptable standard. This event however blighted the start of the holiday. When we returned to the hotel later in the evening there was a light on in the top floor apartment so someone clearly had been put in that room.

When we returned to the reception to check in, the receptionist kinda forgot about us and we had to remind her to call and check on our room. So she did and found out that no one has checked the room yet, so it will take another 20 min. Needless to remind that we were after a sleepless night and half day of wondering around the city. Then after 20 mins, when we approached once again the reception, we found out that the receptionists had changed. One receptionist was giving service to another guest so i approached another one, who couldn't give a damn about me standing there till after he was reminded by the other receptionist to approach me. the ignorant receptionist's name was Nick. After that we checked in. Room was of a good size, facing a building wall. Every morning except for Sunday we were awakened by hammers and radio and voices of construction workers performing works on a building next to the hotel. No one thought of telling us about this, let alone appologizing. The general feeling at the hotel is that they are pretty much feed up with the tourists plus \"this is us doing you a favour, so shut up and be greatful\". Rooms were not vacumed at all, housekeeping missed our room one day. The walls are worn out, bathtub needs some major repair. I found other person's hair in it. Bed linen have not been chaged once during the whole stay. TV had around 3-4 channels in English, all other stuff was on demand for 12.5EUR. Lift was out of order throughout 4 days in a row.

Wi-FI free in the lobby, often not working due to updates. Staff at reception clueless. Dear Management of Eden Amsterdam! This is a honest, from-the-heart review meant for you to take some measures. The above incidents cannot be faced by travellers who arrive at your hotel expecting to get what they pay for, and they do pay quite a lot. What a waste. It used to be a nice hotel. Your staff has to be improved or at least guided how they should treat tenants. Nice lobby is not enough nowadays!

The next morning I found the view outside the Eden Hotel Amsterdam every bit as spectacular as described online! A beautiful view of the canals was awaiting me and it was breathtaking. I also met the gold standard in concierge service, a true master of his craft. In the three mornings I was at the hotel I watched him masterfully direct the various groups of international tourists, gently guiding them into the best holiday experience with helpful suggestions, navigating tips and the like. I found his advice to be flawless and particularly helpful. A simple piece of advice to always follow the tracks on the way back to the hotel kept me from going the wrong way many a times when I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d reach a fork in the winding streets. He also advised me not to walk to the Lindbergh Tours office since there would be a shuttle bus that would pick up at the hotel. I had about 45 minutes before the shuttle was scheduled to arrive so I sought out a little breakfast spot I could dine in quickly in lieu of the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s breakfast buffet. He had to give it some thought since it was early Sunday and most places were not open yet for breakfast. But then he smiled and thought of George\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Deli above the grocery store just a quick walk from the hotel through Rembrandt square. The Eden has two hotels that are actually connected---the Eden Hotel Amsterdam exits towards the canals and Eden Hotel Rembrandt which exits Rembrandt Square (which is a great spot to stop for an afternoon break or for dinner). George\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Deli made the perfect simple breakfast of poached eggs with toasted rounds, REAL freshly squeezed OJ and tea! I dined there every morning. When I returned to the hotel, I admit I started becoming a bit anxious as I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to loose my spot on the Lindbergh bus tour for a trip to the Keukenhof Gardens\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6an online purchase where I scored a ticket at a 50% discount while I was planning my trip. But I soon observed that the concierge was completely in control of the situation for all his hotel guests needs and sure enough the shuttle to the tour office finally rambled up just in the knick of time. As I was riding the shuttle I realized it would have been a bit of a hike to have to walk quickly and even perhaps slightly confusing if you were not familiar with the route, and so I was glad I had waited for the bus. Upon return from my tour I walked back to the hotel at a leisurely pace and enjoyed exploring the surrounding area. The last morning of my stay, the concierge was hard at it again handling all the tourists yet he had made a point of putting out an APB for the airport shuttle bus which he had warned me was highly unreliable. He had various colleagues keeping an eye out for the bus and made several calls giving the confirmation number he had secured for me the day before when he called in a reservation. Yet no bus appeared. It almost seemed like he was a cat setting the trap for the mouse----which would be the shuttle driver---who didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stop at our hotel even though he reported he did and was forced to come back and get me because of all the extra points of control the concierge had put in place.

Stayed three nights at the Eden Hotel with several other colleagues when we travelled to Amsterdam for a big industry event. I was among the lucky few that managed to get a double room but for those with a single room, there was barely enough space to stretch your arms out, let alone have a suitcase in there. The single rooms are TINY! My room was at the end of a dark, dingy corridor and I was greeted with a sickening stench emanating from the open drain in the bathroom. Since there was no air freshener, I had to use my deodorant spray to mask the smell! The shower was really dirty and water did not drain well, so I was left showering with soapy water reaching up to my ankles. Further, the shower gel dispensers were not fitted properly and kept falling off. The carpet in the room also seemed very dirty despite its dark brown colour. A colleague even found pieces of broken glass on the floor in his room, which goes to show that cleanliness is not a priority here. A few other incidents that I have to mention: - Customer service is terrible. I had couriered a large number of corporate materials from the UK for use at the trade fair and phoned the hotel ahead to ask them to hold it for me. Reception insisted they had never received the parcel. This was despite the parcel being clearly marked with my name and me having a delivery confirmation from the couriers! This meant that I was unable to take any corporate brochures to the trade fair and was in no position to have another delivery sent from the UK at such a late stage, which was a big issue for us. I asked several people at the hotel and the concierge was not in the least bit interested in helping me out - even walking off at one point, never to be seen again, while I was using his desk phone to speak to the couriers. Finally on the second day after more persuasion, a different concierge said that the parcel had been sitting in the luggage room for several days! - A colleague phoned Reception to book a taxi and the call was promptly forwarded to the concierge's mobile phone. On check out, believe it or not, he was charged for that phone call! Also, forget about taking the lift because it barely works and a very basic breakfast is 19 Euros! The positives: WiFi terminals in the lounge and the hotel is centrally located close to Rembrandt Square and several tram lines. We would have definitely changed hotels if we had the choice but due to the big trade fair taking place in Amsterdam, hotel rooms for large delegations were scarce.

Lobby area and bar very modern and staff friendly on check-in / out and any time we asked questions of them. Excellent English - par for the course in Holland. I had requested a quiet room and we were given a room on the 5th floor (top), which was certainly quiet. Lovely room - clean, spacious (again, were we just lucky as people seem to complain the rooms are too small??) and lovely modern bathroom (great hairdryer too!). Because we were 5th floor, we looked out over the wall people have complained about. Comfortable bed and TV gave us some English news channels & dutch radio - as we weren't planning on spending much time in our room, TV was not a priority for us! Breakfast was not included in our booking and we were however shocked at the 19.50euro price of this!! We decided to eat elsewhere. On marathon morning however, the restaurant staff were very kind to us - we had brought our own porridge and they made this up for us - no charge - which I thought was very good of them (I got charged for this in London - hence the suprise!) I've stayed off Dam Sq before and that put me right off Amsterdam.

One side is referred to by the staff as the 3 star side and the other is the 4 star side. The price difference for a standard room is 20 euros. We stayed for 4 nights. Day 1 We arrived in the evening to find out that the hotel had overbooked itself and given away our room. We were 2 couples. The other couple we were meeting had arrived earlier and received a room on the 3 star side in what felt like a basement with a view of a generator of sorts.(Room107 Eden hotel side) Prior to arriving we had requested via email, rooms close to each other. We had also advised that hotel that we would be arriving late. My partner and I were told that we would be put into separate single rooms for the first night and then moved into a standard double. One room was on the 4 star side and the other was on the 3 star side. When we expressed our dismay the girl behind the reception was curt, rude and said \" This is all we've got. You can stay here or find somewhere else\". When we went into the 4 star room, the room smelt like a sewer pipe. The sink in the bathroom had a yellowish ring of scum around the drain and there were oily streak marks in the tub. There was a balcony of sorts but the door had to be propped open with a garbage can. The noise outside was very loud. The night manager was helpful and equally horrified by the smell. He brought us an air freshener spray and promised to try and upgrade us the next day. Beware of Room 580 Eden Rembrandt side. Day 2 We were moved into our new room and upgraded to the 4 star side. Our friends also decided to upgrade and happily paid the 20 euros to get out of the basement. They gave us rooms next to each other. Rooms were a good size and clean. All was well. Day 3 + 4 No more complaints. The hotel location is fantastic. The location is without a doubt the best thing about this hotel. Overall Impression This was an adequate experience. The reception staff was not overly helpful or friendly. For the most part they answered your questions and offered nothing more. On more than one occasion a hotel front desk person could be heard loudly and rudely telling a guest to speak English even though the guest was speaking English, but with an accent. If you just want a place to sleep at night that lets you get out to see the city, this is a good choice. If you are looking for something special, romantic or especially memorable this is not recommended. Note: There was ironically, a \"Smile Campaign\" going on at the hotel with Laughing Seminars for guests. It was a common elevator joke among guests at the hotel that perhaps the hotel reception staff might benefit from attending a few of those sessions as well.", "Date": "August 6, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wolverhampton, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cvery pleasent people, would recommend it.\u201d", "Author": "amejm", "ReviewID": "UR73886846", "Content": "i thought my stay at the eden hotel was very pleasent, the people were helpful and polite and for the price i paid i would definatly recommend it to anyone.

Upon querying this with the hotel, they acknowledged they had in error, charged our credit card and offered to refund. We decided to let the charge to through, as we would have had to pay for our stay in a few months. However, when we got to the hotel, we were expecting an Executive room as we had booked. We were placed in a far less superior room, overlooking an office on the side of the building. We couldnt even open the curtains. We went back to the reception and explained that they must have made an error, and we were told that the hotel was fully booked, and that this was the best room they could offer us. We asked if they could refund the difference in room category, or offer us a complimentary breakfast. We were told definitely not, and we were not impressed. They agreed to change our room the next day, but once again, it was definitely not an Executive room. The room was very small, not what was on their website and not what we were expecting. So all in all, we were quite disappointed with our stay. In our 5 weeks of touring Europe, this is the only hotel we would not recommend. It is in a good location, near many restaurants.

The toilettries were in dispensers on the walls. Gorgeous Rituals toilettries. I even bought some in a shop. However could have done with a bar of soap. The beds were soft but so comfy.

Free internet access and printing was another bonus to print boarding passes for plane home. Didn't have a credit card so had to leave a 50euro deposit.

Very well priced for what you get, very large and modern hotel compared to most in Amsterdam. One half of the hotel is Eden hotel a 3* and the other half is Eden Rembrant which is a 4*, slightly strange if you ask me, as all guests can use either entrance, check in desk the same etc, maybe one half has slightly nicer rooms.. Anyway, check in fairly quick, make you sign an agreement not to smoke though, our room was on 4th floor, easy to get to via lift (very grateful, as this is a bit of a luxury in Amsterdam), right in the far corner. Reception staff ok, not the most helpful, and didnt show us to the room, just directed us. Nice room, massive for what we payed was almost a suite, two single beds pushed together, fairly comfortable. Tv, kettle, tea etc, although they wont supply milk?! weird. Desk, and chairs, armchairs and table and wardrobe/drawers. Bathroom really nice, shower over a bath, all modern and well finished decent size aswell, very clean on arrival. Fresh towels daily, put a do not disturb sign on your door and they will leave everything for you. Room was quiet, didnt here any noise from other guests and none from outside either. Unfortunately we wernt facing the Amstel, just a side road but nice view over Amsterdam anyway. Didnt eat in hotel so cant comment on food/drinks, bar area always looked empty though. Overall not a bad place to stay at all, but really depends what you want. Extremely good value for money on room size, but a bit shady about the 4* rooms attached to the 3* building?!? A friend we went with stayed on the opposite side of the square in a hostel right next to bushdocter coffeeshop, he had private entrance to room, double bed, smoking allowed and cheaper. But he had to share a bathroom, room wasnt done up (cracked paint etc), it was much noisier and the steps to room were ridiculous so really depends what you want from your holiday.

This is far not my first stay in Amsterdam and in EU (I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m from Norway myself). But this is the first time when I would like to express my negative thinking about exactly that hotel. I selected it because of the rate- around 80 Euro per night and 7 Euro for city tax, central location and 3 stars level. But in reality I paid close to 100 Euro in addition, because staying in that hotel! I selected to take airport bus shuttle and prepaid for both ways, I used this service several times before and never had any troubles. When I asked in the hotel to book for me back way they refused to do so , by explaining that they not working with that company, although the shuttle bus company promised to picked me up from the Eden hotel. Reception said that I can use public transport (what was impossible for me because of the heavy bag) or ordered taxi via them. I remember that on the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153trip adviser \u00e2\u20ac\u0153 site already has been negative expression that the hotel used not licensed taxi with over pricing, therefore I insist that they provided for me the telephone, so I ordered shuttle bus on my way back (what price a bit over 10 Euro, instead of taxi cost around 40). On the time of departure I waited 10 minutes and bus didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t come ( what never happened before) , I asked concierge to give the phone, so I would call the bus company to ask what happened , but he refused to do so. He said that I already have been said yesterday that the hotel doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t use this company and they recommended to use the taxi. He said that the bus company should to pick me up next to another hotel, although when I called to them they said that they will pick me up to that hotel. Interesting, that I spoke about that with reception, the concierge weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 there! I asked how much will cost taxi- he said 40 Euro and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153accidentally\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd there has been a taxi driver next to hotel, which arrived exactly on the time when I expected bus. Very clearly that the concierge knew that the bus will not come and the taxi come special for me, he knew that I will not have any other option! On the way to airport the taxi driver tried to take out 5-7 Euro extra if I want to use quicker way to airport, I refused , because I anyway weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t that late! When I arrived at home I found out that the 50 Euro deposit charge ( yes, you have to stay there 50 Euro deposit although there no any mini bar and refrigerator in the room) weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t released from my credit card although the reception said that it released immediately. I called to the hotel today and they said that they released it, but the card account showing that they took out this money. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll wait until tomorrow and will call to the bank to blocked that transaction and definitely will write complaint to the local police. The most of scaring in that situation that the hotel not didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t any complaining, they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t care about reputation, and if look on the whole situation I has been lucky that nothing else has been happened with me in that hotel. Because it looks very criminal. P.S. The room has been pretty large, I had windows inside of small yard, so there has been fresh breath from the canal. The hotel is totally non smoking from this year (I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m non smoking myself) but for cleaning rooms which before have been for smokers they using very strong chemicals, and I have been forced to keep open window all the time. It definitely won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be suitable for the allergic humans and so on. Bad has been large and soft , bath has been nice and new, but carpet in the room and blanket on the bad have been extremely dirty , so totally there double impression about the room. And in the light what happened with the taxi and deposit (and that the hotel actively involved in the criminal actions) I definitely WILL NOT RECOMMEND TO STAY THERE FOR ANYONE.", "Date": "June 9, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "kevjane", "Title": "\u201cgreat location but details spoil a good hotel\u201d", "Author": "kevjane", "ReviewID": "UR31581956", "Content": "We had a 3 night stay booked on a special offer and first impresions where good with a good reception area and aproached via a great canal scene with houseboats.

The staff were brilliant, nothing was too much trouble - the conciege was helpful and offered free advise on the best sightseeing trips available. Any trips booked through the hotel can be added on to your room so you only end up with one bill, which we found really useful. The hotel backs on to it's sister hotel the Eden Rembrandt which leads directly onto Rembrandt Square - it's an odd set up with each hotel having a separate reception, conciege and luggage storage, but sharing a restaurant which is used by guests from both hotels at breakfast. We paid for bed and breakfast which consisted of 2 crossants, tea, coffee and orange juice. It's worth bearing in mind that for an extra 2 euros you can eat as much as you want from a buffet style breakfast that is served in the Eden Rembrandt...you'll need to walk past reception and follow the signs for the \"Amsterdam Room\", this leads you through into the Rembrandt hotel-the breakfast room, is opposite the reception. If you get lost, as it is very confusing, ask a member of staff to show you the breakfast room. It's hard to find anything negative about the hotel, as the staff make up for it's short falls, but if I did have to comment on anything, it would be the small rooms, you're definitely paying for the location. Also, there is a severe lack of signs within the hotel..I would suggest asking the staff to show you things like the lifts rather than looking for them yourself as you'll waste a lot of time wandering around.

I had read the pretty varied reviews and so approached this with an open mind. the hotel is relatively near to the centre of town, just two hundred yards from the nearest underground and just two stops from the central station and near some tram lines. You could walk pretty much anywhere without any problems and the local scenery of buidlings and canals is pretty much as expected for Amsterdam. The hotel doesn't look much from outside, but inside the lobby it is bright and quite pleasant. I found the reception staff and conceierge quite helpful and friendly. The hotel has been refurbished. The corridors and layout inside is a little bit like a rabbit warren. The room (a single room) was small, badly ventilated, openen onto a very tiny air vent (courtyard would be overdoing it). There was no bath, but a shower. Depsite its size, the room was full of the latest designs and quite comfortable. The bathroom was clean and funtional and modern, but so modern there wasn't anywhere to hang a towel. I was served breakfast in the main lounge - I am not sure if they have somewhere else for breakfast which might have a little more on offer. I received a stodgy croissant, hard bread roll, slice of cheese and slice of ham, along with coffee and a juice. A waste of money. I won't be adding this to my list of favourite hotels.

They are so hit or miss. I had a friend who had stayed here a number of times and always raved about it. What made my final decision was the price. I was there around Dec 20 and they had a FANTASTIC sale on hotel rooms through one of the hotel booking websites (not the hotel's website) where the room was $90 (with the service fee) a night. That's USD not Euros!! That's for a REAL hotel room, not a small budget accommdate that ran at that time for about $120 USD, some with shared baths. So I had to stay at the Eden for that price. I have to say, that my stay was very pleasurable. My husband and I had gotten separated before we made it to the hotel and he didn't know exactly where we were staying! Needless to say I was a bit upset about this situation. So I went to the reception and they were soooo helpful. A Front Desk clerk allowed me to use their front desk phone to call my husbands cell phone (a US number) as well as some family that lives in the Rotterdam area. I though that was very nice. Also, they brought me to the Internet stations so I could look something up (I can't remember what I needed on there) and got me a glass of water. And although I was very stressed, they went above & beyond in their help and made me feel much better. And those who are wondering, yes i did find my husband an hr later in Rembrandt Square. The room were nice. Typical hotel room. I have no complaints whatsoever. But there was construction going on until 5pm during the week at the time. Luckily most of my stay was over the weekend. The hallway lights were out when I arrived. I thought maybe there was some light trigger, but couldn't find it. So I was feeling the doors until I made it to my room. Turned out the lights were really out, so they put a couple of floor lamps in the corridor. One thing to watch out for is the breakfast. I didn't realize it wasn't included with my room and we had it one morning. It was 16euros a person! which was $50 blown on breakfast for much of nothing. If you go to breakfast and it's not included in your room, they will add it to your bill. So be careful if you choose it because the people checking you in at the breakfast room will not tell you that it is NOT included. If they had told me when I checked in for breakfast, I would have NEVER eaten there. There are great breakfast in rembrandt square. One I believed is called Opera cafe. It looks expensive, but a full egg breakfast was about 5euro and I got a great lunch ham sandwhich special for about 4euro that had sprouts and a nice bread. Very tasty and 9euros for both of us was better than the 32 for both of us at the hotel! So, all in all, if this price is placed well compared to other lesser quality accomodations, definitely go for the Eden.", "Date": "September 14, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cFantastic stay\u201d", "Author": "leannenufc", "ReviewID": "UR19824906", "Content": "My partner and I stayed at the Eden Hotel for two nights and had an excellent time there. On the same trip, we stayed in ten hotels around Europe and this was one of our absolute favourites. We booked the hotel because it was one of the cheaper options available in Amsterdam in the middle of summer, and as a result of this and some mixed reviews on this site, I wasn't entirely sure what to expect. However, I needn't have worried-it was a lovely place in which to spend a couple of days. After a crowded train journey, we arrived in Amsterdam to find heavy roadworks and crowds of people outside the station, which led to us becoming a bit overwhelmed and walking in completely the wrong direction to the hotel. We had heavy backpacks and it was quite a warm day, so needless to say, we weren't in the best of moods when we finally arrived at the hotel. However on entering, we were immediately cheered up. The lobby was really pretty, and the staff very welcoming. The lady on reception asked about our plans in Amsterdam and our trip so far, as well as advising us of the hotel's amenities and the services offered by the concierge. We've stayed in plenty of hotels where the check-in staff have practically tried to force us into speaking to the concierege and buy tours etc, but there was no pressure felt here at all. One thing I will mention about check-in is that they did expect a credit card on check-in, and were unable to accept a cash deposit in its place. We met halfway, and made a debit card payment, with the cash being returned to us on check-out. I imagine most people have a credit or debit card when travelling and won't have any problems, but I figured it was worth mentioning! We didn't ask for a renovated room on check-in, but were pleasantly surprised to find we got one anyway. We were on the fourth floor at the back of the hotel, and the room was beautiful. It was definitely the comfiest room of the whole trip; while it wasn't massive, it was more than big enough for two people and the decor and lighting made it feel very cosy. The bathroom was also very nice, with an excellent shower, and everything was impeccably clean. As for amenities, there was a mini bar, free hot drinks, an in-room safe and the TV had around 30 channels including BBC1 and Sky News. The only bad point (and this is nitpicking really) was that the view was a little strange-we were basically looking out into someone's apartment, meaning they could see straight into our room also, so we kept the curtains shut for a lot of the time we were there! Location-wise, the hotel isn't exactly in the very centre of things, but Amsterdam is a small enough city that it doesn't take long to walk anywhere. It took about ten minutes in various different directions to reach places like the Dam, Leidseplein and the Red Light District, and the train station was a twenty minute walk, as was the Anne Frank Huis. Rembrandtplein and Waterlooplein are only 2-5 minutes away, and there are various canal boat tour options practically on the doorstep. There are plenty of restaurant and cafe options nearby (and if you're tired after a long day's sightseeing, I can recommend the chinese chain Wok to Walk-it's on a street behind the hotel, very cheap and we were able to relax and enjoy it in front of the TV in our room!). Overall, I would say that the hotel is certainly on a higher level than the 3* it is rated as, and superb value for the price we paid (\u00c2\u00a363 a night)-we had a brilliant time, and would love to stay there again if we ever return to the city.", "Date": "September 6, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wiltz, Luxembourg", "Title": "\u201cnot more than average\u201d", "Author": "timeless211", "ReviewID": "UR19747968", "Content": "location is prime, walking distance to pretty much all of central amsterdam! but it ends right there with the prime. rooms are small and crampy, cleanliness leaves to be desired, had dirty towels with holes. windows opened to a closed interior court, so not really any fresh air..

They were jubilant with their room - 404 - and when we saw it we asked to be moved near them although our original room (on the 3rd floor) was very reasonable.

We arrived at Best Western Eden after being bumped from a cheaper hotel, so our rate was very cheap and it was a superb deal. This time around we got a pretty good deal also, although not quite so cheap. I booked a cancellable rate of 79 Euros per night, 10 months in advance, through the hotel web site. I specified two single beds, and a quiet room, because our last stay had a room over a noisy nightclub (as mentioned by others). The hotel has been renovated in part, and I think they are continuing to refurbish the rooms. We arrived and noticed the lobby check-in area had been updated in a contemporary style. We were checked into our room, but discovered it had a double bed. I noticed it was refurbished and in a contemporary style, but rather small and poky, with little natural light. In any event, we needed two beds, although I knew they'd be in the adjacent formation. So I went back to the desk, and the clerk told us she'd have to give us an older room. This was fine, and we got a room that was extremely similar to our room two years ago. It's a bit worn, but everything was clean and in reasonably good condition. The room was larger than the more contemporary one, with more light. On our last visit, breakfast was included. I wasn't initially planning to have breakfast here, given the 16 Euro rate, but when we were raring to go at 7 AM, we decided we might as well. No breakfast cafes were open at that time, according to our guidebooks, and we wouldn't have the same choice and quantity of food. So we splurged that day, and splurged the next, and I think it was worth it. The third day we had to leave too early for breakfast, due to onward travel.

The room was quit spacious too. we didnt have a view out of our room, but that didnt bother us. The beds are very comfy too!! The hotel is opposite the river, and in a great location generally. we had lots of beers and walks. There are some lovely restaurants nearby as well. We hired bikes for two days from MacBikes. It is so easy to do and doesnt cost much. The bike shop is about a ten minute walk away. There are bike paths everywhere. We cycled along the river out of the city on one day, into the counyryside. We would definately recommend not to hire bikes for longer than two days. we had awful saddle sore, and it makes you feel miserable!! We also visited Van Gogh museum and the Botanical Gardens, which were really nice. The Flower Market is just down the road and is worth a visit.

We were on the 4th floor overlooking the park and it was quietish with the windows shut at night. The room although small boasted an interactive TV whicvh you could watch CNN news BBC1 / BBC2 and various local stations. For the money we paid it was excellent.

Take a number 9 from central station keep checking the stops and get out at Plantage Middenlaan. If you go past the zoo and two huge dinosaur statues on the left you have gone too far. Just a short walk from hotel is fantastic market Waterlooplein ( not open Sundays) We also highly recomend Pizza Cruise which was yummy and all drinks inclouded. There is a voucher with the canal bus. Make sure your hungry before boarding. Lastly we have to recomend the Electric Ladyland museum. Its not too easy to find costs 5 euros . 1st Museum of florescent art 2e Leliedwarsstraat 5 420-3776 . Nick who runs it took 7 years to create his cave in the basement.

I was expecting a filthy, noisy place with rude and arrogant staff. It may be the fact that my stay in Amsterdam was a competition win, and therefore I did not pay a penny for it, but I really did not find the Eden hotel that bad. Admittedly, we had to wait several times to be served at the check in desk as there were only ever 2 staff on, but they were friendly and always apologised for the delays. The concierge was also very helpful. The location of the hotel is fantastic - just around the corner from Rembrandtsplein, and a short walk to everywhere else. If walking is not your thing, the bus and tram stops are abundant and everything is easily accessible. Noise at the hotel was simply not an issue - this was probably because our room was on the inside of the building rather than overlooking the street. This meant our view from the window was of a brick wall - but I didn't go to Amsterdam to stare out of my window! The room could have been bigger, and the bathroom was just tiny! It meant a serious case of manoevuring around the toilet to get into the shower, but it was clean. The windows in the room would not open, which I found very odd, but the air conditioning unit worked so I don't suppose it mattered much. I had to request the tea and coffee making facilities, and the concierge brought me a tray with a kettle and plastic cups on, and they were a little stingy with the amount of coffee & tea provided. However they did produce more on request. Breakfast was plentiful - a large variety of breads, cheeses, meats, eggs, bacon, jams, cereals, fruit and yoghurt, as well as fruit juices, tea and coffee. The bar area, 'Garden of Eden' was also quite nice, overlooking the river, and the barman friendly. Overall, the hotel is in a good location, but is of average standard.

I over heard a staff member tell a guest that breakfast was 15E if it was not included with your room. It was not worth 2E. I am very familar with the European breakfasts of meat, cheese and bread. The selection was terrible. There was two choices of meat and two kinds of cheese. They looked like they had been sitting out for hours. They had a crazy attempt at scrambled eggs. It looked more like egg soup. There was so much water in the dish that they egg curds were floating. Yuk. The selection really was not that great. I would have preferred to have found something out in the town. The shower kept going from hot to cold. We would get it perfect and then have to change it again because the water would go really hot or really cold. Positives: The location is good. We were far enough away from the crowds that we were never really disturbed by other people. We were also very close to the Tram stop at the Rembrantplein. Maybe a 5 minute walk away. There are several restaurants and bars in this area. We found a wonderful Japanese place and had dinner there both nights. The hours for the breakfast were nice (even though the food was gross). They open for breakfast around 0700-1030. It is served buffet style in a large(ish) dinning room. The pillows in the room were pretty nice. We slept really well both nights. Usually hotel pillows are a little iffy. Top hotels have nice ones and the crappy hotels have the squishy ones that you have to fold 4 times to sleep good. This was not the case. I liked the pillows. The bathroom was simple with only a soap dispenser hanging to give soap and shampoo. No little bottles or extras to take home. They had a blow drier for guests and it was decent. Advice: If you are just looking for a cheap place to stay and do not expect ANY frills or perks this might be okay. Otherwise pick somewhere that you will not mind spending a rainy day in. Find a local baker or something and have breakfast there. The food is not worth the extra money paid or the time you spend. I hope this helps.

We assumed it would be one of their standard rooms. We got to the room and it turned out that it was an overflow room (this was later confirmed by hotel staff). It was very tired and the window overlooked a brick wall. The bathroom was better than our last hotel, but our toliet smelled like sewer and that was truly disgusting. We had to brush our teeth outside the bathroom because of the smell. We had to hold our breath while using the toliet. We didn't tell the staff about it until checking out..which was dumb because they might have been able to rectify the problem. The size of the room was fine and it was clean (most important to me). It was just tired and looked like it hadn't been updated in 10 years. The wing we were in (rooms in the 100's) were the overflow rooms so I guess that was to be expected. However we felt like we should have been told that when checking in. Breakfast was not included, and we felt like we should be getting more for $200 a night. The location was fantastic however. Right around the corner from Remblantsplein, and a very easy walk to everything else in the city. The canal that the hotel sits on is very pretty and if we had a room overlooking the canal vs. a brick wall we probably would have felt much different about the room and not minded that it was tired. The staff was nice, and we asked the conceirge for advice on what canal tour to do. The location of all the Remblantspelin restaurants 1 minute away was nice.

Rembrantplein is also home to many restaurants, pubs and so on- so there isn't any need to look long for any place to eat or go out.

My room was a familyroom, so it was actually pretty decent sized with two large beds, a desk, table and two chairs, a tv, minisafe and a bathroom with a bathtub. No aircon, but there was two fans. However, as it was quite cold during my stay there weren't any need for the fans. There was some noise coming from the street when the window was open- but I didn't have any problems to sleep. The bed was quite comfy, and although the decor was a bit tacky it seemed pretty clean and not so worn. The corridors are however not so nice, and is in fact quite a maze.

They were apparently having unseasonably warm weather in Amsterdam the two days that we were in town, and it was unfortunate that the window in our hotel room only opened a couple of inches. The room location was on the side of the building and faced other buildings with balconies, and at night, and into the early morning, people would sit on the balconies and talk rather loudly. As if the heat didn't make it difficult to sleep, the constant voices was very distracting. (Try to request a room in the front of the hotel, if possible.) However, this hotel is in a very convenient location. A very short walk to the Rembrandtplein tram stop and within walking distance of many restaurants and bars. The room is very basic, but if you're not too picky, the price is right. We didn't spend much time in the room anyway so it wasn't that big a deal. The bathroom was clean and modern. The staff was fairly helpful. Overall, not a terrible experience, and if it weren't so hot, which isn't normal anyway, it would probably have been very enjoyable. If you plan to get a museum pass when you arrive, there is a place in the Central Station that sells them. I recommend buying it there rather than the tourist office across from Central Station. Much shorter line and less chaotic. Also, to get to this hotel, take tram 4 or 9 from Central Station. It will drop you at Rembrandtplein and then you just need to duck through the alley (towards the canal) in front of the tram stop to get to the hotel. Once facing the canal, go right.
