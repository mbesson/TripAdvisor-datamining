Great for a late lunch. No problems with security (our room had a safe) and the area that the hotel is in felt very safe as it was on a main road not one of the side streets and wasn't noisy at all.

Fortunately, when we got off the lift and walked into our room, I was very pleasantly surprised! I will say that I think we had one of the biggest rooms in the hotel (the rounded, corner room with a whole wall full of windows), according to the emergency evacuation floor plan, so that could make a difference. But, we were very happy with our room, and it instantly made us excited about our trip once again. We were out exploring Barcelona most of the time, but we were always happy to return back to the room at the end of each day. It was safe, quiet, and clean. We were really surprised at how quiet the room was even though all of our windows faced out on the corner of the street which was a very heavy traffic area & right across from the University. We rarely heard any road or horn noise. We also appreciated the free breakfast (although, the breakfast room feels like a dungeon) & espresso machine each morning. It wasn't anything fancy, but it was fine for a free light meal. The front desk staff was really helpful. I came down with a bad cold while we were staying there, and they explained how to find (and use) the Farmacias there. They also directed us on how to get to La Rambla (which is only a few blocks away), Parc Guell, and the nearby Open Top Bus Tour stop.

Can't understand why it's classed as a 2star - I've not long come back from a 4star in Rome, which wasn't any different! Room was slightly on the small side, but that's not really a negative, as it had everything we needed. Room was exceptionally clean. Clean bed sheets and crisp white towels, which is what you would expect anyway but after reading reviews of other hotels around La Ramblas - you never know!! Slept through the night - no problems with noise. Mini bar / fridge in room - apparently the refreshments are free - they didn't charge us for the water we took. There is a coffee machine in the room, but even my clever techno sister couldn't work it out! Continental breakfast. A little basic, but very filling. The usual, bread, toast, cakes, (try the pain au chocolate - yummy) fruit, cereals, tea coffee fruitjuice etc.etc. ALL Staff were very friendly and helpful. Excellent locatation. Very close to La Ramblas - less than a five minute walk - in a straight line, so no way of getting lost!! Lots of very nice clothes shops all around the hotel, so get ready to spend some money. Just behind the hotel is Bus Stop No.1 of the open top hop on/off bus. This will take you to all the sights around Barcelona. it cost 20euros for one day, or 24 euros for a two day ticket. Well worth the money if you want to try and fit everything in in a short space of time. We just managed most of the sights in two days. If you're looking for somewhere nice to eat, try The Attic Restaurant near the centre of La Ramblas. V.nice restaurant. Bill for 4 of us came to 100euros (\u00a370) for 4 three course meals, which included a bottle of one of their dearer wines. Couldn't understand why it was so cheap there as the food was fab. (Tho, Make sure you ask for your starter to come separately to your main, or they'll bring it all out together)!!!! I travel a lot, and always research my hotels before I go - this hotel is definitely value for money.

I booked at last minute via Ratestogo - added 2 nights on to business trip - and had small double room on 4th floor, Room 402. Would have been bit of a squeeze for 2 people but OK for one. Expect that's why they gave it to me. Room was clean and in good condition. Water and soft drinks in free minibar. I couldn't get coffee maker to work, but that may have been down to me. Receptionists very friendly and helpful. I arrived quite a bit before earliest checkin but that wasn't a problem. I was given room at once. When I said I wished I had a small metro map instead of the one on the back of the large map, she cut one out of another map for me. The only lift was out of order on morning I was checking out. Receptionist suggested I leave packed bags in room and chambermaid would lock them away upstairs. I didn't hear any noise from other guests. Bit of traffic noise even with windows closed, but that is to be expected given the good lcoation. I was given window key at reception to open window during day. Hotel is run to higher standards than your average 2 star. There is a white coated housekeeper with clipboard who supervises cleaning and preparation of rooms. As others have said, breakfast is a bit basic, but there is plenty of food there if you want. Fresh melon on the second morning was a welcome addition.

Room was lovely, very clean and with everything you need for a short city break.....beds, clean bathroom, safe, fridge with free drinks, hairdryer, free toiletries .... and hotel had a spacious lift to each floor - always useful! The location of the hotel is fab, just one block from the Ramblas, which means you are near enough to all the action but slightly away from all the hustle and bustle for sleeping at night. We were two girls and felt very safe walking back to the hotel at silly-'o'-clock in the morning. The hotel is also right next to the Universitat metro station and 2 mins down from Catalunya Square station. I would definately recommend the CityPark to anyone going to Barcelona, I have been and stayed in the H10 Montcada before which is a very nice hotel but is not in as good a location as this hotel.

It fitted our criteria of A/C,fridge,non smoking and a safe in the room. We booked it through Expedia in July before we set off on a long trip and it was amongst the most expensive hotels we stayed in. 129.00 Euros room only. And the least value for money. The lobby is tiny, as is the lift. Needless to say so was the room. The bed was so small it can\u2019t even have been a double. It was downright uncomfortable too. There was no night table by the window side, so we pushed the bed against the window wall to be able to move at all. We were falling over our bags as it was. The wardrobe was minute There was only room to hang up 2 jackets, and was really only the entry to the water downpipes. Every time someone upstairs had a shower or used the loo we knew about it. There was a stand at the end of the bed containing T.V. and an espresso machine, with 2 plastic disposable shot cups and 2 sachets of coffee. Minibar underneath no milk provided. The 1st day we returned in the middle of the day and were surprised that the coffee and cups were not replaced, neither were the towels. So we asked for, and got them assuming it was just sloppy housekeeping. The 2nd day towels replenished but no coffee. When my husband asked for it he was told that they only supply once. When he pointed out that we were paying the same rate every night he was given 2 sachets-we had bought our own milk already. It was just ridiculous the machine would only hold these little sachets; I\u2019ve no idea where one would buy them. We didn\u2019t bother asking for new disposable cups-(they were never replaced) as we had our own basic travelling picnic gear and we felt it just wasn\u2019t worth the hassle! We made sure we asked for-and got coffee our last night, ready for the morning The bathroom was (naturally) tiny, and no toiletries supplied apart from soap. They have a breakfast room but we never ate there, plenty of other places nearby. On the plus side the position is very handy Calle Del Pelai corner of Ronda de la Universitat. Close to Placa de Catalunya square and La Rambla But it\u2019s almost on a traffic island, so very noisy from that and our room had virtually no insulation. I always sleep in earplugs and my husband can sleep through anything,but it could be a big problem for other people. The A/C worked very well,and there was a safe amongst the down pipes of the wardrobe.No sign of smoking in the room. Fortunately we didn\u2019t go to Barcelona to spend much time in the room. Apart from all the usual tourist things we had dinner at Los Caracoles, and I can thoroughly recommend it! The food wasn\u2019t great but the experience was. We hadn\u2019t booked but fortunately got there about 8.40pm and only had to wait 1 \u00bc hours in the bar. By which time we had made several new friends and got rather sozzled. On the extreme downside, my husband had his pocket picked coming down from Parc Guel to the open top bus stop. We think it must have happened when we stepped back to let a couple pass us on the very narrow footpath.
