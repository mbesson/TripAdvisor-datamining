The Cortina is not beautiful, but it is excellent value for money. The service was unenthusiastic (and they don't speak English), but the bedding was surprisingly good, and the free hotel wireless was truly high-speed -- far better than I've ever found at a city-center business class hotel. The location on Kant Strasse in Charlottenburg is perfect: the S-bahn (Berlin elevated metro) is right around the corner and the neighborhood is full of restaurants of every ethnicity. There are also a fruit store and a small supermarket within one block (right on Kant as you exit the hotel, then across the street). In short, the hotel is a fabulous deal. As with any super-budget hotel, there are problems. For many people the stairs will be an issue: you have to carry your bags up three flights of stairs. The reception desk is not 24 hour. There is a shared courtyard in which (during my stay) people from the neighboring building sat outside talking till 3 am Saturday night. Still, these are relatively minor, considering the price range of the hotel. I had no problems at all with bugs, dirt, plumbing, etc. Overall, I was very satisfied with my stay.", "Date": "October 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Istanbul, Turkey", "Title": "\u201cWorst Hotel I Have Ever Stayed At\u201d", "Author": "evrenefe", "ReviewID": "UR118459064", "Content": "Today is my second day at the hotel, I will be leaving tomorrow and I am so uncomfortable that I did not want to wait to write a comment. First I must emphasise that for the last 7 years I am travelling to different countries for business and vacation.So I have a variety of experiences from 4-5 star hotels to hostels, and did not have big expectations from here as this was a pension hotel.Before coming here I also read the comments below and the positive ones made me think that the previous negative comments might be 'exaggerated' but I must admit I have to apologise from the people writing the negatives, they were totally right. I booked a single room 'with' toilet and shower but when I arrived they gave me a room with a shower only, the toilet is at the end of a very long corridor.And the shower is -hard to believe but- just a plastic cabinet in the middle of a tiny room.As the lady can not speak English I tried to tell her with my broken German that I would not accept this room, I paid for the other option she said no I booked an economical room.From my Iphone I found the website and showed her both in the website and in my own confirmation mails that I booked a comfort private room.Than she began to say I was right but all other rooms were full and they would not help me.I asked for my money back and she said impossible.I hope you can understand how upset I was. The room is really small and very uncomfortable by the way. Today when I was leaving I left the wet towels on the floor as this is a common practice in most hotels, so I thought the towels would be changed.And what did they do? They put the wet towels back to their place!! I arrived in 10 minutes ago I went and asked 'can I get a dry towel please' and she said 'no the towels are changed every three day and you are leaving tomorrow!' . I can not understand the logic.I said I already put it on the floor so I dont want to use it, and she says this is the rule and this is my problem.Would it cost her a lot or is it a very difficult thing to give me a new towel from the closet?There can not be any excuse for this type of an answer in any part of the world I suppose. The staff is absolutely unfriendly, they do not smile, they do not look at your eyes when you are talking, they may not speak English but at least they can try to understand your body language but they do not care about any needs of the customers. The location is good but you can also find another hotel with a good location too so this should not be the reason to choose here.I definitely recommend you to stay away.", "Date": "September 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Swansea, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGreat location and good value for money\u201d", "Author": "Sophie S", "ReviewID": "UR118204689", "Content": "Just returned from a 4-day business trip to Berlin. I decided to book a single room at the hotel as it was quite close to the conference location and much cheaper than the conference accommodation even if I could have stayed in a much more expensive hotel. The location is excellent, a 2-min walk from the S-bahn station at Savigny Square and the place has some character that a lot of big chain hotels lack. All the rooms are individually decorated and the room I was staying in was very spacious, clean and comfortable. I see that a lot of people on this site are complaining about the staff being unhelpful. It is true that they spoke very little English but they were very accommodating. My evening flight was badly delayed and my plane did not land at Schonefeld airport until 11:20 pm and I didn't get to the hotel until about half past midnight. I was very worried that I would end up sleeping on a bench in the park considering that the reception normally closes at 11 pm but I asked a fellow passenger on the train to give them a ring to let them know (politely and in German) that I would be delayed and the lady at the reception stayed until I arrived, despite the fact that it is a small hotel and I think she'd been there all day since 7 am and it was a Sunday. So I don't think you can complain about the staff being unhelpful. Yes, it is true that they did not change the towels by default but I am sure they would have changed them if you'd simply asked for a fresh towel if you needed one. When I asked for a hair dryer I was immediately given one. As far as perceptions about the staff not being friendly are concerned, I think it is mainly a matter of cultural differences and perceptions. Standards and expectations vary, and when you travel abroad you need to be a bit flexible and accommodating.", "Date": "September 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bruxelles", "Title": "\u201cGood location but bad staff\u201d", "Author": "acia83", "ReviewID": "UR49872316", "Content": "The hotel location was very good, just next to the S-bahn (Savigny platz) and at walking distance from Zoological Garden.

I found the hotel using the internet, and although a little apprehensive (due to some of the reviews I had read on this website) the price and the location were a deciding factor on making a booking. The hotel is very close to S-Bahn SavignyPlatz, in fact, if you are planning to use the S-Bahn network (which I thoroughly recommend) this hotel is definitely one for the shortlist if location is a factor. We were flying into Shonefeld airport from Bristol which arrives quite late, so I had already asked if they could accommodate this - they said they would - and they were true to their word.... even though, it transpired, the hotel staff don't live in. Make sure you tell them if you are likely to be delayed. Initial impressions were - Oh my god, look at the stairs. You have to climb two flights of stairs to get to reception. Not great for the elderly, but otherwise okay. The staff were friendly and welcoming, although as mentioned in other reviews, their english is quite poor. Its rare to find people who appreciate my school German - but they did and they were quite happy rephrasing things and taking their time with me. Probably a good job, as we would have struggled otherwise ! I had a single room on the first floor and it was superb. The IKEA single bed (yes it was Ikea, the label said so) was a little softer than I am used to in German hotels, but none the less the room was clean, in good decor, and had a reasonably sized (remote controlled) TV with about 24 channels programmed in. I had also opted for a single room with en-suite WC/Shower. The WC/Shower facilities were excellent and very modern (probably very recently installed too). A lot of people commented on the towels not being changed. I've learnt this trick in the past. YOU NEED TO THROW THEM ON THE FLOOR. If you hang them on a rail, they will assume you are happy to keep using them ! It certainly worked for me, because the first day I forgot. Another guest told me that he found the hotel very cold, (he was in a different part to me). I did point out that there were extra blankets in the wardrobe, but he didn't like that idea at all. Personally, I found the hotel a little too warm, and regularly had to open the window for 10 minutes before retiring to bed, just to cool the room down. It is true, the heating wasn't on in the hotel at all (but personally, i didn't feel it warranted it anyway). The floor boards did squeak a little in some of the corridors, but to me, the rooms seemed (mine at least) very noise proof. I was not disturbed by the other guests at all. There is NO phone in the rooms, which does make communicating with other rooms a challenge if you need to as the hotel is partitioned into sections - however, take a mobile phone and use text messaging. The inclusive Breakfast Buffet was superb and hot/cold drinks were included, which is not always the case in Berlin pensions. This hotel does not have kettles or drink making facilities in the rooms, and there were no provisions for getting drinks other than tap water (that I could find). Luckily, as this also has been my experience, I went prepared with a small travel kettle and tea bags (how sad and British is that!) They do have some form of WiFi access at the hotel, but it requires you using one of their USB dongles in your laptop. i didn't take advantage of this during my stay, so can comment no further. They do not serve any meals other than the Breakfast buffet but there are tons of places to eat including a restaurant next door. Personally, I would recommend the Zille Markt restaurant around the corner, which I will also review shortly. Overall, I would certainly stay at Hotel Pension Cortina again and would recommend it to friends visiting Berlin.", "Date": "December 19, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Treviso", "Title": "\u201cNot a good hotel\u201d", "Author": "ste_nohype", "ReviewID": "UR19913546", "Content": "The only good thing about this hotel is the location, just a couple of minutes walk from Savigny Platz S-bahn station.
