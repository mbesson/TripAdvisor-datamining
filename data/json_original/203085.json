I immediately received a really friendly response from Roberto Cioce the general manager who advised that he was an old \u2018rugger\u2019 and was more than happy to assist us with sourcing tickets. He fulfilled every request and as he was attending the match too, he travelled with us to the stadium. This has to be the friendliest hotel in Rome. The staff go out of their way to make sure you have an enjoyable stay and if you need anything, you only need to ask. There is even a note in the rooms to advise that if you do not like the firmer mattresses and pillows, you can request for them to be changed to softer ones. As Roberto mentioned, if you ask for something they will do their upmost to accommodate the request if it is in their power to do so. We had a large room that accommodated 4 (2 + 2), which consisted of a double bed and 2 singles and it wasn't cramped at all. The bathroom had a bath with overhead shower which was powerful and hot water was plentiful. The room as well as the whole hotel was very clean. The decor and furniture within the hotel was in keeping with the style of the building. We can quite honestly say that the official hotel photos are a true reflection of the interior of the hotel with absolutely no nasty surprises on arrival. It was so quiet near our room that we struggled to wake up in the mornings, especially with the curtains closed making it really dark!

The standard room was a good size and was elegant, in keeping with the style of the hotel. All staff were welcoming and kind and helpful. The hotel seemed busy, but not overly so, mostly with rugby supporters for our first few nights, but the atmosphere was brilliant. Mr Cioce is a rugby supporter himself and made himself known chatting with us all. He runs an excellent hotel with many personal touches that distinguish it from the larger chains. I would unhesitatingly recommend it - so if there are any Scottish supporters booked in at the Napoleon for your match, I am sure you will enjoy yourselves. But, with rugby in mind, Rome transport to the Olympic Stadium is not great - especially in snow and ice, so allow plenty of time to get there, and be prepared to queue for return transport - it took is over two hours to get back, once we had left the stadium - mainly due to the snow that fell in the afternoon. So we were doubly glad to have booked a table at the hotel dining room once we did get back. Their food is not expensive and we ate in two evenings and thoroughly enjoyed it.

We were asked if we wanted to change our pillows if they were not suitable and we had clean towels each day. Our room was on the 3rd floor with a balcony overlooking the courtyard. Our room was very comfortable, spotlessly clean and quite which was tastefully furnished and a big modern bathroom. When we shown to our room there were fresh flowers on the dressing table which was a nice touch and on our wedding anniversary Roberto Cioce, the owner, sent flowers and a bottle of bubbly to our room. There was a variety of good food for all tastes at breakfast and plenty of coffee and tea and we also had a couple of meals in the restaurant which were inexpensive and comparable with other restaurants in the area.

The rooms are well-appointed, big bathrooms, multi lingual TV and a fast free internet connection. All rooms face into courtyards; while not very attractive views the rooms are quiet as rooms in Rome facing streets can be very noisy. Ask for a room on floors 4 - 6 as they will be brighter than lower floors. There is a large bright breakfast room with a varied selection of Italian, Meditarrean and North American breakfast items. Cappucino and/or expresso are offered along with a wide selection of good teas. Mary and Mirella are always in a pleasant mood and great you happily each morning. The unseen room attendents do a wonderful job keeping the room clean. There is a cosy bar and small dining room. We had a drink in the bar one evening where good wines are offered by the glass at reasonable prices. We dined in the restaurant one evening as well. The food is good and the service attentive. A good place to eat if you do not want to go out one evening. There is a lounge on the 1st floor with two internet capable computers. Complimentary newspapers are also available in the morning.

It is extremely noisy when other people are going in and out of their room so you get woken up several time a night by doors banging and people walking around.

The breakfast was good and they served cappuccino and it was free. It is walking distance to the subway, I recommend walking or taking a bus as the subway is dirty. Also, I recommend paying for a car to and from the airport. We took the express train from the airport. It was 32 euro for both of us and not as convenient as taking a cab.

Thank you Franco. Breakfast is included in the price and there is plenty of choice - from cold meats and cheese, to cereals, to bacon and eggs and toast and constant supply of hot beverages. Just a personal recommendation - Forno Roscioli - a superb little deli/bakery/restuarant just round the corner from the Hotel - ask Franco.

Each room has a great A/C which you can set so that your room is extremely cold if you like. The rooms are small (as are most rooms in Europe), but bigger than my rooms in both London and Paris. The only complaint (which is minor) is that the shower is tiny. The rooms do not appear to have been remodeled recently, but are extremely clean and have been kept up very nicely. The bed is comfortable. 2) Location - It is not centrally located, but is still only a short walk away from just about everything you would want to see in Rome. Maybe a 10-15 minute walk to the Colosseum, a 20-30 minute walk to Trevi Fountain or Spanish Steps, a 30-40 minute walk to Piazza Navona and Campo de Fiori, and a 45-60 minute walk to the Vatican and St. Peter's Basilica. All of these times are of course estimates and are very leisurely walks. - In addition, the metro stop is DIRECTLY outside of the hotel. Thus, if you do not want to walk you can easily take the metro to many of the locations mentioned above. On my way back from the Spanish Steps it took me about 15 minutes from the time I left the Spanish Steps to the time I was sitting in my hotel room. - Although not centrally located, I still think the location is EXCELLENT. 3) Staff - The staff is wonderful (especially Franco, the head concierge). Franco took the time to map out a fantastic walking route of Rome, tell me what times were the best times to avoid lines at particular places (which he was right about), and recommend places to visit and restaurants to eat at. The entire staff is friendly and willing to help you with any of your needs. Although this is a 75 room hotel, they try to make you feel like you are the only guest and really make you feel at home. 4) Miscellaneous - The WIFI works great in the hotel rooms. - The hotel offers a free buffet breakfast (which I cannot opine to as I have not actually eaten it yet, but I assume like everything else the hotel has to offer it is excellent). - On Friday nights, the hotel invites all of its guests to a little reception where they have light snacks and wine (all complimentary). - It is very quiet and you will be able to sleep in as late as you like with no disturbances.

And then the concierge called the breakfast room and had them open for us so we could have a capaccino while waiting for the tour company to arrive.

Shower setup was somewhat awkward. Other comments: Some other reviewers warned of pickpocketers in the area. We never ran in to any sort of issue like that, but of course we exercised due diligence. At no time did we feel unsafe, even coming back to the hotel at night. Other reviews complained about thin walls. I didn't hear anything from next door, but maybe the rooms were empty or the people were quiet. Either way, it was not a problem for me. Again I'll say how helpful the staff was. Couldn't ask for more. Anyone visiting between 1-30 August 2011 be informed that part of the metro subway is closed due to construction of a new \"C\" line. There are buses that are taking its place but those buses tend to be cramped. It's a PITA sometimes, but definitely not the fault of the hotel.

The flat screen TV is small and the beds are hard. The bathroom with a bidet and awkward placement of the toilet makes it not as user friendly.

An interesting thing is they turn off the AC in the lobby during the day and in Summer, that can be suffocating.

Our stay in Rome was amazing and the hotel was perfect for us! We didn't plan to spend much time in the hotel as there were so many things we wanted to see and do during our short stay, however due to the early closure of the metro we found ourselves relaxing in the hotel bar in the evening. The staff there were lovely, especially one barman who taught us some italian in between serving us and others. On arrival at the hotel we were immediately greeted with a warm welcome and checked in. Even though we arrived before 2pm (the check in time) our room was ready for us and we were given a brief tour of the hotel's amenities before being shown our room. The room we had was small but perfectly adequate for our use, it was clean with a sizeable bathroom and a very comfortable bed. The breakfast was thoroughly enjoyed by my partner who had more than one serving each morning, there was a good selection of bread, pastries, cereals, eggs, bacon, cold meats, fruits and yogurts to satisfy all, including myself who is a fussy eater. Tea/coffee was served instantly and the staff were more than happy to assist in anyway they could. One member of staff who made our stay a memorable one was Franco at concierge, he was very welcoming and gave us a detailed map of Rome, which he highlighted using various colours to represent all the different things and places for us to see. He continued to greet us throughout our stay and was helpful in every way, even when we requested additional pillows he sorted that within two minutes. Overall, we would highly recommend this hotel as an ideal base for a city/sightseeing break in Rome.

The hotel is on a busy road opposite a lovely park. The area is really no worse than that of a central London hotel. We never had any problems or felt unsafe at any time. We were greeted at the front desk by Roberto who was very friendly and helpful and let us check in early - which was great seeing as we had an early flight! The room was very standard 'no frills', like that of any other really. The only complaints we had was that the bed is very hard and you only get one pillow, which gave us a bit of a sore neck! They advertise satellite TV - which fair enough you expect most of it to be Italian - but you literally have the choice of CNN or ESPN if you want to understand it. Not that I minded particularly but my husband struggles to sleep most nights and would have appreciated a bit more choice. The shower is a bit temperamental, I found it goes hot and cold randomly. Also the walls are thin, 90% of the time it was fine as we were awake but a couple arrived with a baby and we could hear her every time she cried and even when the parents were singing/talking to her! But apart from that the room was very clean and we had a comfortable stay for the 6 days. Breakfast was yummy, lots of choice and dinner was surprisingly good value. Cheaper than most restaurants near by! We never had a problem with service and the food was always cooked well and tasty. Even the bar and mini-bar drink prices were reasonable. Most food and snacks in Rome were very expensive (2 euros for a simple chocolate bar.) The hot tourist spots are within walking distance but if you're feeling lazy (or just worn out!) the metro is right outside the door. We were a bit weary of using it but it was simple enough, you can select English on the ticket machine and the prices are very cheap. 4 Euros for a day ticket or you can pay 1 Euro for a ticket that lasts 75minutes. Meaning you can basically visit the Vatican for 2 Euros.

Our own experience was surprisingly adequate, nothing more and nothing less. I must confess, I did expect more 'oomph' from a hotel rated so highly on this site. Hotel Napoleon stands on a major busy road, facing a small park. Along the street are a number of clothes shops, a pharmacy and a very tasty corner ristorante about 5 minutes walk to the left on exiting the hotel. The best thing about this hotel though is that the metro station is literally on its doorstep. Directions: When you arrive at Termini station, take the 'Linea A' metro towards Anagnina and hop off at the next stop - Vittorio Emmanuele station. Follow the exit marked P. Dante and once you emerge into the street exhausted, jet-lagged and disorientated, you'll see Hotel Napoleon rise in front of you like a welcome cup of hot tea. (We arrived at night, took the wrong exit and ended up on the other side of the park in a dimly-lit street that was covered in graffitti and decorated with loitering shadowy figures - not fun). Vittorio Emmanuele is a great location. One metro stop from Termini, on the line for major sites such as the Trevi fountain, Spanish Steps and Vatican City, and within walking distance of most other tourist areas. We walked to the Colosseum in about 12-15 minutes and even managed to walk to the Spanish Steps in under an hour at a leisurely pace. Please note: traffic lights are only routinely obeyed by drivers so cross the roads at your peril. We unashamedly used a Roman woman and her child as a human shield as we negotiated a particularly hazardous 4 lane road. Location aside, Hotel Napoleon offers clean furnishings, a beautiful and relaxing middle floor lounge, generally good service and helpful staff. It is not an impersonal hotel, but certainly doesn't have the warmest feel. This didn't bother us as we were only there to rest and sleep, but I do feel a bit of envy reading reviews by travellers who managed to strike up great relationships with members of staff! Breakfast is between 7am-10am, with the usual continental fare of scrambled and boiled eggs, bacon, bread rolls, cheese and cured meats. Cereal and fruit are also available, as well as sweet sponge tortes and iced croissants. Coffee and tea are served on seating, and the rest is self-service. Rooms: We booked a standard double room and it was SMALL. Adequate but a bit of a squeeze for those with big suitcases (as we did). The superior rooms are undoubtedly larger. There was a good-sized closet for hanging up clothes, an electronic safe, double doors which opened onto a small terrace with a view of the very bare, quite depressing courtyard below. Again, nothing grim, just a bit disappointing. The bathroom had no bath but the shower was great - plenty of hot water and the cubicle was spotless. Again, size was a problem. If you are over 5'5\", you may find yourself banging your elbows when drying yourself or worse still, you may find yourself shimmying sideways in order to use the toilet. Our toilet was awkwardly recessed into a corner in such a way that when I sat down, my chin was inches away from the sink bowl. In fact, I was so tired after a long day's walking that I found myself simultaneously sitting on the toilet AND resting my head on the sink. I've never been able to do that before! There are no tea/coffee-making facilities which was another disappointment, although it is available at extra charge (or included in superior rooms). Our neighbour in the room next door enjoyed watching TV at 8pm every night, and we had the pleasure of listening to it alongside him whether we liked it or not. Either he had turned the volume up or our walls were too thin. What didn't help was that the TV is placed at the foot of the bed, and I presume his TV was directly against ours on the other side of the wall. With the rooms being so small, there is nowhere to escape TV noise. Incidentally, if you like firm beds you'll love this hotel. We are delicate little flowers and woke up with sore backs! The hotel restaurant offers typical Italian dishes with large portions. They request that you pre-book, but we asked for a last-minute meal and found the dining room to be almost empty. Service was erratic, but it was late and the staff were probably tired and eager to finish their shift. If this all sounds overly negative, please remember that we slept soundly, there was no street noise or loud traffic to disturb us and there is the welcome relief of an air-conditioning unit in the bedroom at the end of a long, hot day. The lounge is opulent and is extremely well-equipped with plenty of sofas and armchairs, a free internet access point, a large plasma TV, a piano (!) and plenty of multiple language newspapers to browse. Free Wi-Fi is available in the hotel, you simply need to ask the reception staff for your unique username and password. You can purchase metro and bus tickets and the Roma Pass at the hotel, as well as book tours and arrange bookings for restaurants, events etc. Elevators/lifts are small but there are plush carpeted stairs available for the exercise-inclined. Free wine-tasting and a selection of local produce (e.g. cheeses) are on offer every Friday evening. We didn't indulge, but we certainly heard much merriment from the lounge below! All in all, Hotel Napoleon was a great base for travel and offered us a clean, decent stay. Any problems or difficulties were swiftly dealt with and staff were courteous at every turn. I see it as a good 3-star hotel, masquerading as a glamorous 4-star plus establishment.

My biggest disappointment was not having the adjoining rooms we had been promised. The triple room for the kids was ample in space but the double was rather small, with a particularly small shower, an old fashioned hair dryer and very firm beds. We were able to sit comfortably in the large lounge area of the hotel, which also included a computer with free WiFi. Breakfast was provided and was excellent, offering lots of variety. The staff was very helpful providing us with local restaurant recommendations,as well as directions to an incredible gelato place. While the hotel was not quite in the centre of things, we easily walked everywhere, including the Vatican. There is a subway station very close to the hotel if needed. I would definitely recommend this hotel - there is so much to see and do in Rome that you spend very little time in your hotel room.

We stayed there before and after a cruise and had a rate of 159euros per night including breakfast. The hotel is family run and you can tell. It is dated, but we weren't looking for hip and happening. We wanted a good price, and a clean safe place. Here's an example of a family run hotel: when we asked about a casual restaurant to go to in the afternoon, the concierge walked us down the block and around the corner to it. He didn't just say, go out and make a left and a right....he walked us there. BTW the pizza place around the corner (go out and make a left and a right at the first corner, 3 or 4 doors down on the right) is great for a quick bit in the afternoon. There is also a great casual Italian restaurant 2 blocks away....we went for lunch one day AND for dinner - it was really good! We had the family size rooms, which have a large king, and then in a semi-separated room two twin beds. There is a large dressing/closet area, and a large clean bathroom. Everything was very clean. My only complaint is that they use way too much perfume in the rooms when cleaning - the cleaning products (if the scent came from that....it was so strong it was as if a bottle of perfume had been sprayed in every room) smell strong. When we got home our suitcases still smelled of the perfume thousands of miles away. The breakfast is a decent buffet, adequate. They serve free of charge hot chocolate, tea and coffee drinks, I think even cappucinos. You can order fresh squeezed orange juice as well. There is a bar in the upper lobby and a restaurant - both were empty, but we sat and had a nice quite drink. Free internet across from the bar too. There is a small grocery store around the corner too. We had hired a guide while in Rome and he told us that the neighborhood that the hotel is in is not safe at night as it is near the train station.

The hotel is in a good location, a pleasnt walk to the Colloseum, with excellent links via the Metro station at the front door. As for Roma. The Roma Pass proved useful at the Colloseum to avoid a long queue. We used the packed buses, metro and saw numerous sights. The queue at the Vatican was long on Monday morning. The beggars and flower/umbrella/handbag/jewelry hawkers were a nusiance; but a firm \"no\" moved them on. Someone tried to scam us with asking directions, then give us presents, then asked for a gift in return of cash for fuel. We used Terravison buses from the Airport. Just OK.

We most highly recommend the little bakery with pizza just around the corner. We loved the food and the service of a very nice young man who is so proud of his store and his English. When you walk out of the hotel, turn left, then left at the first street you hit, and the store will be two or three doors down on the right. The thin-crust pizza was to-die-for, and the baked goods were fantastic... what a competent store in the North End of Boston tries to replicate. The staff of the hotel was also exceptional... very attentive and very helpful, with the exception of Mr. Lombardi, the concierge, who seemed to take a pissy pill every day before he came to work. After a week we could not dismiss it as one bad day. He always brushed us off when we sought assistance (and notwithstanding that we well-tipped the concierge desk throughout the week). He did not upset us or undermine our trip at all... he just stood out among an otherwise truly warm and wonderful group of people. If you are an American tourist expecting a Hilton or Marriott hotel, take note.

Any reviewers who describe the area as \"sketchy\" probably haven't been in too many cities. While not the most scenic part of town, we always felt perfectly safe and appreciated being in a quieter area, after the chaos of Rome. We found the included breakfast to be excellent---a huge selection of pastries, yogurt, cereal, meats, cheeses, eggs, bacon, and so on. The WiFi worked flawlessly (not true in the other hotels we stayed at). Easily the BEST part about the Hotel Napoleon, however, is definitely the staff. As others have described, this is a small family run hotel and the personal touch is apparent everywhere. Everyone we met, from the concierge to the front desk staff to the bartender and maids, was friendly and genuine and truly wanted to make our three night stay in Rome the best it could be. We were lucky enough to be there on a Friday night for the complimentary wine and cheese reception, and the hotel sent up a bottle of champagne to help us celebrate our anniversary. This is a fabulous hotel, well-priced, well located, and sincere in their desire to please their customers.

The intention of this one is to give a deeper insight, so please forgive any hyperbole. If it\u2019s a bit long winded sorry \u2013 what I have to say can\u2019t be said in just a few short words. I'm biased, let's make that clear to begin with. I'm biased because I've stayed at the Napoleon several times and view the place as slightly more than *just* somewhere to sleep. And I\u2019m biased because the management and staff are, by now, rather old friends, and both have done much to initiate and perpetuate the feelings of amity I have for them personally and respect for the commitment they put into the place. Admittedly, then, I'm not exactly without an axe to grind. But I bought and paid for the axe and feel justified in grinding it \u2013 hopefully you\u2019ll find the results useful. The concierge staff \u2013 your first point of contact and the one you will have the most dealings with - are always full of smiles and help. Whether you need help with a route or a restaurant they tend to fall over themselves to be of service. If your bedding isn't to your liking, again, you just have to ask. They'll change your mattress or your pillows without a problem. And they'll do it with the same smile they bring to all their duties. They\u2019ve nearly all been doing the job for years, and Franco, Peter, Roberto Lombardi, Fabio, Domeniko and Kristos {he\u2019s the new guy and I have no idea whether or not I\u2019ve spelled that correctly} are all politeness incarnate, even when faced with the most stupid of questioners {I have first hand experience, being just about the dumbest person I can think of}. Smiles and cheerfulness are a permanent feature of Napoleon staff. A further plus is the individuality, something indicated by many of the pastels and line drawings which hang on the hotel\u2019s walls bearing the name \u201cR. Cioce\u201d. No one else will tell you this - least of all the hotel manager, whose work they are. Any of them would be worthy of sale. Instead, Roberto chooses to leave them on the hotel\u2019s walls rather than put them into a gallery. Such modesty from a talented illustrator is as breathtaking as it is charming, and neatly sums up the personal touch which makes Hotel Napoleon and its management\u2019s approach to business a breath of fresh air. Profit, yes. But not cheaply gained. The Cioce family, like their employees, earn every Euro by honest hard work and a slavish devotion to an ethic all too rare these days. Napoleon is an old hotel built in an old Palazzo. A huge part of the appeal is old world charm. Furniture in your room is more likely to be made out of hand finished wood than plastic. I think that's a good thing. But you can't shut out the 21st century altogether, and that's why the bathrooms are modern, the TV is digital and the aircon has a remote control. Several reviews lately have attempted to present a less than glowing impression of Piazza Vittorio and its surroundings, so I\u2019ll place here a few words about the area. Hotel Napoleon stands on the Esquilino, one of the Seven Hills of Rome. Cicero and Tiberius both lived here, Maecenas built his famous Gardens on the hill\u2019s slopes, and Julius Caesar lived just down the hill in the {in}famous Suburra. Neighbours don't get much better than that. And the National Museum of Rome is a couple of blocks away, built into what remains of the Baths of Diocletian. It should, therefore, be plainly apparent that the area is a very old one, rich in cultural and social history. This area has been built on and lived in for around 3,000 years. Yet it appears that some reviewers want it to be brand new. You can\u2019t please some people, can you? The Colosseum is a gentle 15 minute walk away, through the winding paths of the Park of Trajan. If walking isn\u2019t your thing there are buses and trams very close at hand. Across the road is a park, great for kids of all ages and home to a number of friendly Roman cats. Life outside the Napoleon - during the day at least - is a bustle of activity. There's a large market, bars, shops and restaurants {which tend to be much cheaper and more charming than those is Centro Storico}. Termini is just a few minutes' walk straight across the park, or one stop on the Metro. And the flower stalls dotted around the Piazza Vittorio are delightful. They seem to stay open all night and add more colour than these monochrome words can illustrate. At night it's quiet, and there are none of the sonic seepages which are an unavoidable feature of many hotels in the more immediately central part of Rome. A short walk down either Via Cavour of Via Nazionale brings you to either Via dei Fori Imperiali or Piazza Venezia and both are busy areas at any time of the day. So close, but so far away in terms of noise and crowds. If you don't want to go out you can eat or drink in. Both the restaurant and bar are priced to be competitive with local bars and restaurants , and the staff in both are a delight. If you choose to go out {I\u2019d recommend that you do so, for although I\u2019m passionate about this hotel I also love the area} I can personally attest to the quality of Al Cavallino Bianco, Trattorias Morgana, Monti and Vecchia Roma, all of which are {literally} just around the corner from Piazza Vittorio. And they\u2019re just the tip of the iceberg. A few words about the safety of the neighbourhood at night. The two really important words are \u201cNo Problem\u201d. It\u2019s my custom on returning from an evening\u2019s wanderings to pause for reflection and smoke a cigar before retiring for the night. The last time I did this was at around 1.15 AM this Monday. I\u2019m not a man who enjoys fear and if Piazza Vittorio had any worrying aspects I certainly wouldn\u2019t hang around it alone at night for any length of time. Put any worries raised here about personal safety out of your mind, they are utterly groundless. I feel safer in Piazza Vittorio at 1.15 in the morning than I do in my little English village {pop 300} at any time of the day. For sure there\u2019s graffiti. But if graffiti is something which frightens you then you should avoid Rome altogether because you\u2019ll see it everywhere. It\u2019s part of Rome\u2019s social history and has always been the Roman\u2019s first choice when it comes to expression of discontent. You\u2019ll find heaps of it at, say, Pompeii. Hotel Napoleon isn't a Radisson. It isn't a Hilton. It's a family run hotel and the emphasis is on personal service. In this it takes a pride, and I know something of the passion which goes into the running of it. But for all the big passion behind the scenes it's the little things - those little touches here and there {like the bottle of wine and the flowers left in our room on my wife's birthday the first time we stayed there} that will surprise you. They surprised me, so much that we kept coming back and have never been disappointed. If it sounds like the owner must be a friend of mine it's because he is, a close and much valued one. And that friendship was born of the impression I took away from my first visit \u2013 I simply loved the staff and the way the hotel was run. I booked a hotel.

They were extrmely helpful and even got us a taxi to take to our next hotel from where we were starting our tour and the conceirge made sure that the cab driver knew where to go. Location is great, near markets and restaurants and right next door to the metro. Room was very clean and spacious. Plenty of room to place like 10 suitcases on the floor. Bathroom was small was not cramped, this is a standard room we stayed in. I am not fond of shower curtains which the shower/bath had.

As such I felt a bit boxed in the room. Breakfast was lovely. One thing o found annoying was that I arranged for private transfer to the hotel from the airport. The car was a shuttle bus for me and my husband. Price was 48 euros. I though it was a bit pricey as I was under the impression that it would be nice sedan like private car. Also it's not the hotel's shuttle bus as I had to pay the driver directly in cash while I was aging thinking I'd be able to settle the bill with card at the hotel. When the driver gave me the receipt for 48 euros, I gave him a 50 euro note and he pocketed the entire money with no change of 2 euro. Now 2 euro to us is not much, but I was annoyed at the principal. I would be happy to tip the driver but it's my choice, the driver should have given me the change and then it's my choice to tip him. It is inappropriate of the driver to assume the tip with the money given so this is a complaint agaisnt the driver and not the hotel.

However we were shocked with what we experienced here and we are still confused about how these other reviews could be true. First off, the hotel is in a very bad area of Rome and it's scary to be outside even during the day time (this is coming from 3 New Yorkers who have seen it all). There's graffiti literally covering all the walls of the shops including one that said \"Go Home Yankees\" and the hotel is located right outside a sketchy looking park with many shady characters and no other tourists/touristy things to be found. In fact, we were jeered at with racial comments by several locals while getting off the subway at the hotel and feared for our lives (no joke, we made a run for it). We had some trouble finding the place so we called the hotel directly and the concierge did not speak enough English to tell us where to go. Luckily we still found our way despite this. When we got there, we waited 30 minutes to check in because there was only 1 concierge on duty even though a huge line had formed leading outside the door for people checking in. This 1 concierge was also responsible for checking guests out at the other concierge desk AND taking luggage up as there was no bell hop in sight either. Additionally, the hotel is in dire need of renovations. The whole place smells like cigarettes and is very old and outdated--the website photos are very misleading. Our room also had a musty odor. There was only a noisy wall A/C that seemed to die down in the early morning, no central air. The bathroom was clean but the shower would alternate from scalding hot water to freezing cold water every 5 seconds--what a way to end a hard day of sightseeing. Other than 1 evening shift concierge,the others were very rude to us. The first night we called down to the front desk and told them we wanted out. We were informed that we would have to wait until the morning because no one on at night knew exactly what the cancellation policy was but only that there would be a penalty for leaving early. We checked out and moved to another 4 star hotel for the same price in a better area where we had a wonderful stay. To their credit, they are indeed literally steps away from the metro (next to where a homeless man resides) and their Wi-fi is fast. They do have a great selection every morning for breakfast and the days we left too early to go they packed us a box to take with us which was kind of them and the rooms are larger than what you'd find in most European hotels. However, there are definitely better hotels elsewhere for the same price out there that are much SAFER, more modern, and cleaner with friendlier staff.

It was so bad I can't remember the name...However I will always remember Hotel Napoleon's name as the only place I will stay in Italy's most beautiful city. I chose the hotel for the fact that the Metro line has a stop right out the front door (and the photo on the website of the room). I can say that the plan worked out except for when we first arrived. We took the train to the termini with the idea we would easily get to the Hotel by the Metro. Problem was we had too much luggage. Dragging our luggage up and down the stairs in the Metro was dubbed the 'Death March'. We must have looked like desperate, sweaty criminals on the run when we arrived. My advice....take a taxi from the termini, it's 6-7 Euros plus 1 Euro for each piece of luggage. When we arrived Domenico greeted us like 5 star clients-Thanks Domenico! -And got us to our rooms post haste. A very strong porter took our luggage up. I'm sorry I can't remember the Porters name...but he gave us a short tour of the elevators, breakfast room and common areas on the way. Our first impression of the room, was it was extremely warm. Romans are very conscious of electrical use so the AC was off. Our Porter turned it on and showed us how to use the remote for the TV and AC. The AC worked quickly to cool the room. We were pleasantly surprised at the size of the room and the large, by European standards, bathroom and our balcony. The balcony had no view, but you have Rome to wander to satisfy all your viewing needs. The 4 marks instead of 5 for cleanliness is for the bed spread that needed a good cleaning. Our room- 505 was very quiet. A huge plus considering how loud traffic is in the city. Breakfast was better then most \"Continentals\" offered. The usual fruit, coffee, cereal, toast and pastry are available...however there were many lovely coffee cakes, fresh salad makings, cold cuts, cheese and scrambled eggs. Oh yes, Cappuccino and hot chocolate are available- no charge. By the way, we made a sandwich of the breakfast brioche and cold cuts that we ate on for a snack on the plane home. Mary is the crown jewel of the breakfast room, bar and restaurant. Everyday she greeted everyone who came into the breakfast room with a warm Buon Giorno! One day she served us breakfast, poured wine at a complimentary wine tasting and then served us dinner in the hotel restaurant. As a chef, I know and appreciate an employee who looks busy all the time and is actually doing something. Mary was flawless in her service in a way that was unobtrusive and professional. (None of the American crap where the server has a need to tell you their name) At the Friday evening wine tasting, Roberto the Manager, welcomed us in and spoke about his love of Ruffino wines. We had a some nice cheeses and salamis plus some crispy toasts with garlic and anchovy. That evening we found out the Hotel Napoleon is a family owned business. Ever so much more personal then the corporate run places where you feel like another number/person in line I HEARTILY recommend the Hotel Napoleon!!!

Mr Franco greeted us by coming from behind the desk and shaking and welcoming each member of my family by name. Even though we were tired and sweaty from a long, hot overnight train ride, he treated us like we were dignataries. EVERY request we had, from softer pillow and matress to directions and advice, he gave them with a smile and without delay. He is a tremendous asset to any hotel! Now, to the hotel itself. If you take the metro (Line A - Red) to the hotel, get off at the Piazza Vittorio Emanuele stop which is only one stop from the Roma Termini (main train station). After coming up the escalators and stairs, turn left and keep left every time there is a split in the underground hallway. That will bring you up to ground level about 20 feet or less from the hotel entrance! The surrounding area is not the best, but not horrible. Once you enter the double wooden French doors to the hotel, you will find Mr. Franco (smiling) hopefully and a wonderful hotel experience! It's beautiful! Your bags are taken to your room for you, there is a big lounge with a TV (in English), Internet access at a desk, large dining area where the wonderful included breakfast is served and a bar. The rooms have A/C and the outside noise is little to none. The rooms aren't huge, but definitely roomy enough to walk around comfortably as is the bath. We had 4 family members, so we had to book 2 rooms as most rooms in Europe that I found only had a max of 3 beds. The front reception will handle faxes and computer printing for you as well. For a hotel so close to many attractions, this hotel is priced very well according to my research. Mr. Franco and the others will help you find your way around the city. It is a very short walk to restaurants, shopping and the typical tourist attractions such as the Coloseum, Forum and Circus Maximus (what is left of it). There are street vendors and store shopping just outside of the hotel. The vendors will haggle if you like that challenge! Getting to the sites further out is quite easy using the Metro.

It seemed a bit shady. We checked in with the very friendly & helpful staff and made it up to our pretty big (for europe) room (#119). We immediately started looking online for hotels in other areas. We decided to give the Napoleon at least a day and stayed. We quickly realized that the area was not that bad. The graffiti is off-putting, but there is graffiti EVERYWHERE in Rome. There are homeless & gypsies everywhere in Rome. So, just deal with it. Our first night was Friday, so Roberto had a lovely wine reception and that really helped us enjoy our stay. The location is great because we had an easy walk to the Coliseum & Roman Forum. The Metro is right outside and easy to use to get almost anywhere you'd want to go. We are walkers, so we don't mind 10-12 miles per day of walking around a city like Rome. It's true there is no view, but if we wanted to sit in our hotel room and look out the window, we could've just bought a book about Rome and saved ourselves the trip. The staff was incredible, the breakfast was good, the bed could've been a bit more comfortable, but the room was fine. We had dinner at the Roma Antica down the street on the first night and the food was really good and pretty inexpensive. Other nights we ate closer to the Spanish Steps (Otello - Awesome. Ate there twice). Then some gelato and a 10 minute metro ride right to the hotel's door. We never felt unsafe, even when walking around our hotel at night (and we lived in West Philadelphia, we know what unsafe feels like!). I would stay in the Hotel Napoleon again. The price was comparable to a Suburban Marriott or Hilton in the states. Some of the complaints on this site are unfounded and, frankly, racist. If you're afraid of graffiti or non-white people, then you have bigger concerns than your hotel in Rome. When in Rome, don't miss the Borghese Gallery Museum in Villa Borghese (you MUST reserve your tickets in advance, you can't show up & walk in). Also, 5:30 pm every night on the right side of the bottom of the Spanish Steps is a free walking tour of the historical city centre. The tour guides work for tips and it was a great little walking tour. And don't miss Campo dei Fiori and Trastavere.

It is centrally located with the subway right at the door step. From there, it is quite easy to walk to the Colosseo and Forum Romano. The hotel is in an old building, so the structure is old, but well-kept. The only thing I can agree with the last reviewer's negative views is the size of the elevators: yes, they are quite small because they are basically antiques. But this didn't bother us at all. We were happy to take the very wide stairs whenever there was no need for an elevator, but taking the elevator was not a big deal; more like an \"exotic\" thing to do. Front-desk staff was not warm but professional and helped us with all information we needed, except when we wanted to buy train tickets to Napoli, one of the staff members we were consulting with tried to convince us to buy from an agent he knew, saying that buying at the station could be difficult. Being big city dwellers ourselves, we quickly found out the train station was at walking distance from the hotel and purchased our tickets right on spot in 5 minutes! This bothered us because it sounded as if he wanted to profit from our assumed naivet\u00e9. Food at breakfast was good, though not very Italian, more like American breakfast, but well-served. Staff at the restaurant was very helpful and truly friendly and helped us with anything for our 4-year old. One morning breakfast, though, the restaurant was extremely full and guests had to wait in line to be seated, so the restaurant size cannot accommodate a fully booked hotel. Rooms were simple and clean. Beds are not king-sized, but mattresses are comfortable. Slow internet was available in just one old computer that did not have connection to a printer. We stayed one more night at this hotel after returning from Sorrento to take our flight home, so we stayed in 2 different rooms and saw no difference in terms of comfort. We did check out on time, but our transportation to the airport arrived quite late and the only person at the front desk did not help us carry the luggage (the same guy who tried to sell us the train tickets)! We had paid the airport shuttle along with our hotel bill, but when we arrived at the airport, the driver demanded that we paid him! He was quite aggressive and rude and could not speak good English, but with my somewhat ok Italian, I explained we had already paid at the hotel, which he took as a lie and called the hotel from his cell phone. As he was talking to the hotel, we left against his will because we were already late for checking in due to his delay in arriving at the hotel. I'd say the service at Napoleon is not very standardized or consistent. I think it is one of those hotels that can afford, if you're lucky, a good stay or a not so pleasant one. It really depends on how relaxed you are. If you're willing to risk, I'd say it's a good stay without all the 5-star amenities for someone who will be spending whole days exploring the city, which is what we did. Why would you stay inside a hotel in Rome anyway, except for sleeping? In the end, I have to ask myself if I'd return.

We had 5 rooms with 14 people and the convenience of having the metro right at the front door to the hotel is just priceless. We arrived via EasyJet from Rome and used their car service for transport from the hotel straight to the front door of the hotel. Their car service was much cheaper than the Leonardo Express train from the hotel. It was also cheaper than the airport shuttlebus service which was 8 Euro per person. We had a Vatican Scavii Tour scheduled soon after landing and the Napoleon people had a little pizzeria around the corner waiting for our group for a quick lunch. The hotel even called ahead and had our pizzas ordered for us when we got there. The concierge even walked us to the front door of the pizzeria so we would not get lost or waste time. We bought all of our metro tickets from the front desk so we didn't have to waste time using the machines or ticket counters in the metro. They made several dinner reservations for us and gave us directions, they let us use their front desk computer/printer to checkin for our next flight and print 28 boarding passes. The rooms were comfortable and clean...not fancy but definitely larger than normal. The Air Condition worked great. The in-room wifi was free. The breakfast buffet was really big, varied, nicely laid out in a big organized dining room. The people here just bend over backwards to do anything possible to make your stay better.

I'm also writing this on our last night staying here. We stayed here for part of our honeymoon and booked the Hotel Napoleon based on the popular reviews on Trip Advisor and the close proximity to Termini and Metro. We booked directly with the hotel and also had them arrange our airport transfer pickup on arrival - the whole process was really easy. The cost was also cheaper than using one of the online reservation websites. Unfortunately our flight from Istanbul to Roma was delayed and we arrived about midnight, around 1.5hrs later than expected. After collecting our luggage we were fairly exhausted and were looking forward to getting to the hotel and going to bed. Unfortunately we were greeted at the airport by no other than Mr Grumpy (you know that one from the Mr Men series!!). He was possibly the most grumpiest person I've ever come across in hospitality. He took my wife's luggage and grunted - kind of like a pig - then walked off to the transfer car. We were too exhausted to care so we tried to laugh it off and both agreed that whenever we saw Mr Grumpy around the hotel we would say \"Hi, Mr Grumpy\". And we did. Mr Grumpy. OK, so not the most pleasant welcome to Rome though we dealt with it and got over it fairly quickly. After checking in at 1.30am we got to our room. A pleasant surprise awaited - a nice bottle of Pinot Prosecco chilled on ice with two Champagne glasses and a card that read \"Congratulations on your wedding, enjoy your stay in Roma\". Perfect! This almost immediately made up for Mr Grumpy. Being so tired we put the Champagne in the fridge and went straight to bed and it kind of goes down hill from here. I think we were just unfortunate on our stay here though. From about 6.30am onwards we were awoken by the noise from other rooms. We stayed in room 219 which just may happen to be a particularly bad room for noise. We could hear people walking in their rooms above, kids talking, doors opening, showers running, things being dropped in the bathtub, toilets flushing and water running through the drainage system. It was seriously bad and I was totally shocked. Given the amount of positive and complimenting reviews for this hotel I am convinced that we just drew the short straw and managed to bag ourselves the worst room in the house. We persevered and by around 8.30am the noise had just about left the building. The shame about this is that the curtains and shutters are so good that the room is almost completely black when daylight arises - perfect for a sleep in - only you can't due to the noise!!! Anyway, after a few more hours sleep we finally arose at 11am. And missed breakfast. Two days in a row. The only other pitfall we experienced about Hotel Napoleon was the daily room cleaning. Overall the actual cleaning was fine and no problems. Though for some reason they missed taking out the used coffee and milk satchels and didn't replenish them either, for our entire stay. I found this a little odd and kind of annoying. The cleaners also left our empty champagne bottle and used champagne glasses lying around the room for the length of our stay. Lazy cleaners. Jealous, i'm sure. Other than a few small problems we really liked the hotel. Like all the other reviews here, the hotel really is a nice place. The staff (other than Mr Grumpy) are very nice, attentive and extremely friendly and helpful. I would definitely recommend this hotel to others, just use these words to your advantage and maybe you can snag a 5-Star stay for the price of a 3-Star hotel in Rome.", "Date": "May 13, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ajijic", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Hotel, Great Location\u201d", "Author": "shardock", "ReviewID": "UR63941705", "Content": "This is an excellent hotel with a great location; a few blocks from Roma Termini train station, a few blocks from the Colosseum and just steps from the Underground Metro stop.

It had heat and A/C, a window you can open for fresh air, a large in-room safe, mini-bar, telephone, TV, desk and a couple of chairs, free in-room WiFi and a free computer in the lounge/lobby. Save yourself some time and get the log-on and password from the Concierge first. The bathroom was very nice with heated towel racks. The pillows are a little flat but other than that, it was great. Lobby/lounge is very large and very beautiful and many guests sat there enjoying an evening drink and relaxing. The desk is maned 24 hours a day. The Concierge was extremely helpful with maps and short-cut directions and even called and confirmed our airport car service and they will print out your boarding passes for free. The hotel can arrange car service for you if you want. You can also exchange money for Euros at the hotel but their exchange rate is not good. There are 2 exchange houses right across the street from the main entrance to the Roma Termini train station. They are closed on Sundays. When you exchange money they usually give you large bills and we found that the hotel would gladly give us change in smaller Euros. The hotel has a very nice full bar that has a manager's happy hour on Friday evenings. The bar is open from 12 noon until 12 mid-night and serves salads, pizza, soups, lasagna, sandwiches, etc. Lunch prices ranged from 4.5 Euros to 8.5 Euros. They have a small dining room for dinner. We ate there several times and the food was excellent and reasonably priced, for Rome. Menu selections include chicken, veal, lasagna, pastas, appetizers, soups, salads, deserts, beef and fish. When we were there, prices ranged from 4.5 Euros for side dishes to 17.50 Euros for Fillet of Beef. Reservations are highly recommended due to the small size of the dining room.

Selections included scrambled eggs, hard boiled eggs, bacon, cereals, bread, pasteries, yogurt, fruit, cheeses, meats, tomatoes, cucumbers, etc. juices, tea and coffee.

We weren't disappointed. We booked through the hotel itself, which is recommended, as they have better deals, such as one that we got that included airport pickup in the price of the hotel. They were there on time to pick us up from the airport, even though our flight was later in arriving. The hotel staff was very friendly, and always quick to help out with directions. The room was clean, but smaller compared to American style hotels, which is to be expected. But there was enough room to put our bags. But if you are going to Rome, why does it matter how big the room is, so long as it is clean, comfortable, in a good location, and have good staff? It was a bonus that they had complimentary internet, which alot of places don't have, but you have to ask at the front desk for your password. Also, you get the splash page to signon again fairly frequently, but it is no matter, because the internet worked well. They also have a restaurant on site and breakfast had a lot of choices, from general Italian fare to American fare. They are also located only a 10 minute walk from the Colleseum, Palantine Hill and the Roman Forum, as well as Circus Maximus. In addition, they have a subway stop right outside the door of the hotel, which you can use to get around to any part of the city quickly, such as the Vatican. The staff at the hotel, as mentioned was very accommodating and helped us with our bags coming in to the hotel, as well as quickly obliged our inquiry into how to use the air conditioner, as a remote was needed. It took a bit, but they figured it out and it was easy to use. The rooms, for the most part were quiet, except the walls are a bit thin, but our neighbors were quiet enough so it wasn't an issue.

We chose this hotel from the Tripadvisor recommendations and because this was one of the few hotels with a decent rating that would accomodate 4 in one room. The room itself (101) had a double bed and 2 good sized singles. The bathroom had a (not quite full sized?) bath and a good shower. There was a new LCD TV with dozens of cable/satelite chanels but BBC world service being the only english speaking channel (fair enough - we weren't in England). The room looked out into an inner courtyard and this meant absolutely no noise from outside for a good nights sleep. We opted for the tea/coffee making facilities in the room for a few euros extra as this not usually provided in my previous experiences in Italian hotels. There is small bar which does basic pizzas and toasted sandwiches for a light snack from 1200-1900 and a restaurant which does a good menu if you like fairly basic but good quality dishes (as we do!) with a few more for the more fancy tastes. Breakfast was excellent with bacon & scrambled egg/fruit/cereals/pastries/cold meats all on offer and very nice. The Hotel is nicely furnished with comfortable lounge areas to watch large TV's and use the free desktop computer (free wi-fi is also available in every room). All the staff go out of their way to assist in every way possible and do go to the free wine tasting if you are there on a Friday - Franco, Roberto and the bar manager whos name escapes me particulary deserve a special mention. The location of the hotel is a plus and also the only downside. The metro is right outside the hotel and will take you to the Vatican, the furthest attraction in 15 minutes. There is also a stop at the Spanish Steps which is ideal for the Trevi Fountain and shopping area. The Colloseum is a 15 minute walk (uses Francos directions as it will take you through a nice park away from the traffic). Now the only downside. The hotel is in a large rectangle around a park and I think 3 of the sides have a collonade with shops and this could and should be a beautiful area. The fact is every wall and shop shutter is covered in graffiti, and there is usually a couple winos and other undesirables hanging around the square. This unsettled my wife and kids whilst walking past. In all fairness as soon as you walk a minute away or jump on the metro you are away from it.

The room wasn't the biggest (i can't judge on other hotels in Rome to compare this to as this is the first hotel i have ever stayed in, in Rome) but apparently this is normal, and with 20 million plus visitors a year to Rome you ARE in the tourist capital of the world. The area was fine, you are near the main railway/bus terminal (Termini) in Rome, i never felt unsafe, have a look on street view and you will see graffiti in the area but this is everywhere in Rome so don't look at this as being a negative for the area.

I was looking for something better this time and believe I have found it - the Napoleon has a good central location, right next to the metro and still just a stone's throw away from the exit of the part of Termini railway station where the airport express train stops. Having read many reviews and noticing the high rating this hotel enjoys at Tripadvisor, I decided to give it a go, and wasn't disappointed. The hotel as mentioned is close to Termini, although the walk from there to the hotel certainly isn't suitcase friendly - but most of Rome isn't. The location (Piazza Vittorio Emanuele II) is dominated by a park which is pleasant enough, and the hotel itself lies in a 19th century building. The arcades and general area around isn't the best, with some litter and uncleanliness existing, but then again this seems to be abundant in Rome. The hotel has a fairly small entrance, and the main foyer resembles more a narrow hallway, but there are two desks there, and the staff are very welcoming and helpful. Upon being handed the keys, the guy I talked to also showed me a map of Rome and circled around the hotel's location and the major sights, however he was so fast doing it that I didn't even have time to tell him I already knew all this since it was my third visit..but perhaps most their visitors are 'virgins' :) While the entrance may be small, there is a very large salon on the second level, where you will also find an internet station as well as the breakfast room, bar and restaurant. While according to the hotel's website the bar serves light snacks meals from 12 - 24, I experienced that it instead closed at 19, as the restaurant opened, but that you could still have items from the bar, only in your room (at extra room service charge). I therefore found the website information to be somewhat misleading, although it wasn't a major issue. Minibar prices are fairly ok, a 75 cl bottle of San Pellegrino - aque minerale naturale (frizzante) cost \u20ac1.50 which is what I would call a steal compared to the absolutely ridiculous minibar prices that usually greet me in my own country. The room is somewhat as I would expect in an old building and in a major city such as Rome - not particularly big, but still nicely refurbished. However, I am not sure if I would rate the room as 4 star on its own. The best thing about the rooms is that they face an inner courtyard, which makes it whisper quiet at night - really! And in Rome, that is hard to come by, I am sure. So although there is no view at all (4 metres to the local neighbour who will slam his window shut just as you open yours ;) I would certainly prefer it this way and be able to sleep with an open window at night, since it is too early for A/C season (in Italy). The bathroom is pretty good and seems to have somewhat heated tiles - at least they are not ice cold so they will not wake you fully up during a nightly toilet visit ;) The breakfast is exceptional when compared to other relatively modest Italian versions I have seen. There is cereals, normal bread, toast bread (and a toaster), eggs (but no egg cups?), scrambled eggs, bacon, various meats, cheeses, jams, honey, fruits, coffee and tea. A hot (or to be more precise - cold) tip is to visit the nearby Palazzo del Freddo - Italy's oldest ice cream parlour! It is just 5 minutes walk from the hotel, and they have 30+ variants - treat yourself to real Italian ice cream! While Rome is fairly negotiable on foot, the metro sometimes helps to save your feet, as hours on a lot of cobblestone wears you slowly down. This time I went a lot outside the city itself - to Via Appia Antica, the Aqueduct park and to Ostia Antica, and all are really great experiences in springtime - it is all green already and birdsong is abundant - and it makes for a good change from the hustle and bustle of the city centre. Rome can be rather taxing this way - I feel the traffic is worse than it used to be. And the litter on the streets. And tagging (not graffiti). And beggars. And pushy sellers. In fact, all of this will now result in me probably saying 'ciao Roma' instead of 'arrivederci'.", "Date": "April 4, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dublin", "Title": "\u201cExcellent service, very friendly\u201d", "Author": "PamelaandBarry", "ReviewID": "UR59939002", "Content": "My husband and I went to Rome -- on his third time, my tenth (I'm a Roman historian, so have spent lots of time there during my studies). This was our first time at the Hotel Napoleon and we were both delighted with the hotel, our rooms, the staff and service, etc. Our room: we had a room on the fifth floor with a comfortable bed and balcony; which myself as a smoker appreciated. The room itself was quite spacious and additional pillows easily available; it was extremely clean and very quiet. The bathroom was pretty good as well -- the shower had extremely good water pressure; the toiletries helpful and it was cleaned every day. I would agree that the shower curtain did have a mind of its own at times and it would have been nice to have a bathtub as well, especially after walking around Rome all day, but overall, definitely, excellent facilities both in the room and bathroom. Would have been nice to have a movie channel (even to purchase) as we relaxed in our room a few nights, but this is not a criticism, merely a comment/suggestion. We did have a minor problem with the wi-fi, but somebody came up to resolve almost immediately and there was a shared computer near the bar/restaurant, which was great (with FREE internet). Food: We ate in the hotel restaurant once, which was OK. The acoustics in the room meant we could hear everything on the other side of the room, but the staff were really friendly -- my steak was delicious and we enjoyed it. My husband mainly ate breakfast and he thought the bacon should be crisper and the eggs were somewhat runny, but I ate breakfast on the last morning and thought the eggs were ok, the bacon ok and the selection overall excellent, so this is really down to personal choice. The bar: We were invited to the wine tasting on the Friday night with one white and one red with light snacks; it was a really lovely chance to meet some of the staff and some of the other residents, so many thanks for the opportunity and much appreciated. The staff: ALL were excellent. Any problems (minor) were resolved quickly; they gave recommendations about a good steakhouse (Vito's near the Vatican, excellent) and other various bits and pieces. Our room, no matter how late we left in the afternoon (e.g. 2 or 3 (only 1 day...) was always cleaned whilst we were out with fresh towels every day, etc., and even cleaned up a mess in the bathroom the first morning when I struggled with the shower curtain (sorry about that, I did try to clean the water up....). An issue with somebody next door (playing a musical instrument) was also resolved immediately (if that couple is reading this, I wouldn't have minded if you had continued playing (at a lower level) but not answering the door when I knocked and then yelling at me when you finally did doesn't mean it's my fault - you caused the problem in the first place! ) and the staff member who called was extremely apologetic, but it was not his fault.

The airport (JFK) lost our luggage. When we checked in we mentioned that our luggage had been lost somewhere between JFK and Rome. The concierge, Frederico, asked for our claim which he photocopied & assured us he would handle, which he did! The concierge worked tirelessly to track it & next day our luggage was delivered to us in our room. Their staff will help you with all your travel needs from highlighting maps and explaining the metro (they even have metro tickets there for you at the front desk) to calling to reconfirm your tours. The food in the hotel restaurant is excellent, desserts fantastic and their free breakfast buffet is superb, I loved it! The rooms are the typical small European size, but they are beautiful, clean and have all that you need including a mini fridge for you to hide away leftover pizza, well, if you have leftovers :) I have recommended this hotel to my family and friends, and my parents are now planning a trip to Rome in November... and yes, they are absolutely booking the Napoleon. I forgot to mention the Metro entrance is literally right outside the door. Also, you can walk to the coliseum in ten minutes, so don't get too \"metro-happy\", you can walk to the Pantheon in 25-30 minutes to work off the gelato and cookies. What is great is that you are away from the tourist hotels, so the food and shops near the Napoleon have reasonable prices. There is a pharmacy a couple doors down and the Bank of Rome too, where I would use my ATM card to pull Euros directly from my American Bank account. Oh! And when we left Rome, we didn't depart until 6pm-ish, so the hotel held our luggage for no additional cost, so we could still wander about during the day. SO, you can galavant all day, and before heading home, metro back to the hotel, pop back up right by the hotel door, grab your luggage, and then have the concierge call you a taxi to the airport (it is too hard to use metro with luggage in tow). Now in reality, we popped back up from the metro, grabbed a gelato and then got the luggage, but you get the gist. I also recommend Dark Rome Tours, especially if you can get Valeria or Rachel as guides (two archaeologists). You can look up tours on [--], and don't miss out on the Crypts and Catacombs tour as well as their tour of the Coliseum. Also, a great place to eat dinner near the hotel is TRATTORIA VECCHIA ROMA on Via Ferruccio, a street behind the hotel in the direction of the Coliseum. It gets packed late in the evening full of locals, so go early. Finally, last bits of advice: you need good sneakers... don't buy food from street vendors... if you cannot live without soda, buy it at the little grocery/convenient stores and squirrel it away in your mini fridge... keep a pen handy... and have fun!!!", "Date": "March 27, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney", "Title": "\u201cBest I experienced in Europe.\u201d", "Author": "nic680", "ReviewID": "UR59371416", "Content": "I really enjoyed my stay here.

I had prepared with great care my visit to Rome and I had chosen to stay in this hotel due to the reviews I had read in Tripadvisor. I thought that I had made the right choice within my limited budget, but I was wrong. First, I believed what the hotel says that pick-up at the airport was a courtesy if you book for three nights, IT IS NOT ! We had to pay \u20ac48 for the \"courtesy\". It is NOT mentioned in their site that you can ONLY avail of this \"courtesy\" if you book DIRECTLY with them and NOT if you do through Booking.com, as I did. Second, I had made clear through several emails that we wanted a room with TWO beds as we are two male friends but we were given a double bed room. Thankfully it was big enough to sleep the two together, but that was not what I clearly stated before. Third, the photos of the hotel, mainly the ones in their site, are very deceiving. One thinks it is an European 4 stars hotel but it is more a 2-3 stars. The room is very small for a 4 stars one and so the bathroom. Fourth, I had managed to get ONLY ONE non-Italian channel (BBC World) among the dozens of TV channels. This is a poor offer for a hotel used mainly by non-Italian guests. Fifth, breakfast is just average and we had to queu for some time to get a table.It is low season now, I can imagine how this can be when in high season. On the positive side I should say that the internet connection works very well in the room and that there is ONE free-to-use PC in the lounge. Also that it is very quiet, the heating and cleaning are good and there is an entrance to the Metro (very ugly in Rome) just ten steps in front of the hotel door.

Everything in the bathroom worked. -- Location: on a pleasant square, with access under an arcade that kept the rain off. The metro was at the door, with connections everywhere. The walk to the ancient sites was easy and pleasing, and it was good to be a little away from the tourism glop. The nearby restaurants were good, and had local client\u00e8le. A highlight was the manager's hour on Friday evening to offer guests wine and cheese and a chance to chat. That's not my kind of scene usually, but it worked well here.

Hotel Napoleon is spacious and elegant with an old world charm and atmosphere and we very much enjoyed our 7 night stay here over Christmas. The hotel was just like their website and photos portrayed it. They have a lovely spacious lounge area with comfy armchairs, a computer for guest use (there is free wireless in the rooms if you bring a laptop), a charming bar for drinks and snacks and a nice restaurant for dinner (we enjoyed both!). The breakfast room is elegant too with a lovely buffet selection to choose from - there is something to appeal to everyone and they serve teas and special coffees made to order. Our room was lovely and a decent size and looked like the 'yellow' one on the website with a modern roomy tiled bathroom,. Do ask for extra pillows though and they will immediately bring them up. The hotel hosts a weekly wine and canapes evening where staff and guests can mingle and chat. This was held on Christmas Eve (although usually a Friday I think) and we found it a lot of fun. I thought the location was great and we felt safe walking around the area, even at night when we were dining in local restaurants. The metro is right outside the front door and on the best line to get around Rome. Termini Staion is 5 min walk if you want the trains or buses and the Coliseum is an easy 10/15 min walk so all in all, very central and easy to get from here to see everything Rome offers. We booked online with the hotel and took the long-stay package. This meant a complimentary airport pick up on arrival and a comlimentary dinner in the hotel one evening - 3 choices each are free and you pay for extra choices plus drinks so these are both very good inclusions - the hotel is excellent value and is altogether a much better experience than what we've encountered in higher priced hotels. Full marks need to go to all the staff - service is top notch here. They are all very polite, friendly and helpful with information and in particular Franco and Roberto on the Concierge Desk and Sarah in the Restaurant/Bar.

Metro is just outside the door and under cover of canopy and you can connect to the airport without ever going outside.

Hotel staff and concierge are very helpful with information on Rome, restaurants close by, and any other request you may have. You can buy metro tickets at the hotel and exchange foreign currency at an acceptable rate with no additional fees. However, use American Express Credit Card to pay for gifts, hotel rooms, food and other expenses where possible because the exchange rate is much better than converting to Euros, and American Express does not charge a transaction fee. Rooms are spacious (by European standards), quiet and comfortable with a private bath (an American staple) complete with bidet. The hotel provides toiletries such as bath soap and shampoo along with a hair dryer in the bathroom. However, do ask for extra bed pillows! There is a small (22\"?) flat panel TV bedside, but don't expect a lot of English channels (anywhere in Italy!) The breakfast is very good and the staff attentive, but expect a similar menu every day. This, too, is standard in most of Italy. The hotel staff will meet you at the airport (no extra charge) on arrival which is extremely convenient, especially if you've arrived from overseas and are tired from the flight. The hotel manager, Roberto Cioce, made arrangements for an early check-in as our 11 hour flight arrived at 7:30 am and we were completely exhausted. We were treated to breakfast while the staff prepared a room for us, customer service that is unmatched in the larger, chain hotels.

Additionally, you can take a nice 10 MIN stroll and reach the Colosseum by passing through a lovely park and some nice residential neighborhoods, this route by the way, brings you over a hill and allows you a spectacular view of the ruins (we happened to catch them at sunset on a cloudy day.. WOW!) The B-fest was outstanding with wide selection of items and delicious coffee. The staff, as others have mentioned was polite and helpful they seemed to go out of their way to make you feel welcomed. Our room was spotless and a decent size for an European city hotel (great water pressure which I really care about).. our view left a little to be desired, being an inner courtyard, but it was quiet as heck, and who goes to Rome to sit in your room and look out the window anyway?? Another big plus was the free high speed WiFi, since sadly, we both had to check in with our office on a daily basis.. this was easy to connect to, fast and flawless! Some people have questioned the neighborhood, but this was my second trip to Rome and I thought this neighborhood was terrific! I felt extremely safe OH and here is a little tip.. there are vendors in the streets outside that sell everyday items for really good prices (a lot of the actual citizens of Rome shop here).. instead of paying for hotel laundry service, we went out and bought 4 pairs each of socks for 2 EUROS!!!

First, let me mention all the pro's: the location of this hotel to the train that runs from the airport and the metro is incredible. It took me roughly 5-10 minutes to walk to the train that runs to the airport and only 5 seconds to reach the steps of the metro station. Sure, as some of the previous reviews have pointed out, it isn't in the most luxurious area of Rome... but, Rome has graffiti and broken beers bottle on side streets just like any major city in the world. Speaking as a frequent world traveler (over 40+ countries visited), I think this should be expected (it might go without saying, but some negative reviews, like the one below me from Kansas might not have been anywhere but Hawaii). I walked from the hotel back to the airport-train station at 5am in the pitch black, and didn't confront any uncomfortable situations. I also managed to hit some major attractions from this location... I took the train from the vicinity of the hotel to Bascilica di San Pietro/ Octaviano for 1 Euro, and saw the Vatican, Castle of Saint Angelo, Palazzo Pamphilj, Pantheon, and Coliseum (among other sites) on the walk back to the hotel, which took about 4-5 hours. The hotel staff helped in giving me great directions. From the moment I walked in the door, I was greeted with the utmost level of hospitality, and felt the family-like atmosphere I've always envisioned of Italian culture. I found the room to be quaint, with a very comfortable bed (topped with a robe and slippers), a nice bathroom, a view of the adjacent building (which was nice to me, as it gave an authentic, Italian feel), a little flat screen TV, small fridge, and a coffee machine/table, and so on. In the evening, a complimentary \"wine-tasting and appetizer\" experience was offered in the bar area for an hour (I believe this is done every Friday). Tons of the hotel gusts showed up, as well as the hotel manager - who gave a short speech about the hotel and wine. The \"wine-tasting and appetizers\" turned out to be very tasty, and lasted longer than advertised, with several glasses and appetizer trays being replenished. ('ve attached pictures from both the room and wine-tasting event). As for the complimentary breakfast buffet, I cannot comment as I had to leave the hotel for my flight before it started. There was also an elegant lounge with complimentary Wi-Fi and one computer for free internet use. The nearby streets offered some great bargains (tables with purses, clothing, etc), as well as a couple fairly inexpensive eateries. The negatives are minute, if there are any: when I woke up at 5am, I could clearly hear other plumbing systems in the hotel sporadically going off\u2026. but this didn\u2019t interrupt my sleep. At the same time, considering that most of the architectural structures in Rome are quite old, this should probably be expected at most places. The price was a little high for the value, but this is mostly due to the devaluation of the US Dollar. I\u2019m trying to think of any other negatives, but I cannot think of any more. So, I\u2019ll end my review here. I hope you find it useful, and wish you a splendid time in Rome: Paesi che vai, usanze che trovi...

IF you are a non-smoker; The hotel has changed to a non-smoking hotel but you can still smell the smoke through the carpet and even bed sheets, it is really bad for someone who doesn't smoke. IF you like going out at night; It loactes at a pretty rough and at night, you may not feel safe to go out. IF you have sensitive skin type or have dust-mite allergy; The bed sheets are not very high quality and it will make your skin itchy. The carpets and bed cover are old and dusty, if you are allergy to dust-mites, then it will be very hard for you.(I'm a victim, I took allergy pills and still get terrible rash and itchy legs, have to knock myself off with some alcohol to sleep) If you have a bda back; the metress is not so good, if you are lighter than your partner, then the matress will be higher on your side. There is only one layer of sheet over the matress, so it is very unconfortable. IF you are tall and large built, the shower is tiny and very silly with the shower curtains. If you use the shower curtain, it keeps sticking to your skin as the area is very small. (I'm only 160 cm tall and my dress size is XS, i found it is tiny for me) If you don't, then the water goes all over the place... Howerer, if you have to stay at this hotel, eg. work arrangement etc. I suggest you prepare a few things: 1, a quit as they don't have one 2, some shampoo as they don't supply as well 3, sleeping pills (noise may prevent you from sleeping) 4, a kettle if you like a hot drink in the room as they don't have one as well 5, perhaps you don't want to open the curtains/windows as the view is pretty depressing (a very poor neibourhood and old buildings) 6, don't pay for their buffet breakfast, it is very ordinary and the bread/cakes are not fresh and the fruits are old as well. They have a little restaurent in the hotel, but the food is pretty average and the waitress doesn't speak English. (Not very friendly as well) There is only one good thing about this hotel is a guy worked at the front desk, who gives you a map of rome and help you with some information about sight-seeing.

It was also impressive that he always addressed me by name and knew what my room number was. The Coliseum is a short walk away though easily maneuvered streets My room was very small, albeit complete with every amenity possible. WIFI was a pleasing perk. In my room, no less. It was a bit disconcerting to shower with the curtain constantly sticking to me. But, how long does it take to shower, this was a minor discomfort. The bed was very comfortable, and a second pillow was immediately brought to my room The air conditioner was the quietest I've every heard. Even though I closed it in the morning, the staff always had it turned on when I returned in the evening. The decoration of the room was classic and very very pleasing. Desk and armoir, examples of Italian furnishings expected at a good 4* hotel. Lots of lovely prints on the walls and the whole decor well planned and coordinated. Breakfast left nothing to be desired. Cappuccino upon request was delightful. The fresh fruits and veggies a pleasant addition to the usual plethora of sweets I encountered in all my hotels and B&B's in Sicily. Service was prompt and always with a smile.Everything was fresh and appealing With the entrance to the Metro directly in front of the hotel, I could easily get to the 'center' of the city at night. Unfortunately, eating places in Piazza Emanuele Vittoria leave much to be desired. But taking the M to other places was so easy. As a single woman traveling, I was a bit intimidated by the neighbourhood, but upon Franco's encouragement, I did venture after dark and never experienced anything unpleasant.(my first venture all alone in Rome) The whole area is filled with small shops selling reasonably priced clothing and shoes from China.

The hotel is just 10 steps from a Metro station and travelling from there is fast, efficient, economic and safe. The neighbourhood was quaint and calm and Sue and I had no reservations about walking through it at late hours. The rooms were cozy and immaculate. The grand staircase was splendid with its red velvet carpets as were the impeccably clean marble floors and pale yellow and white d\u00e9cor. There was no request to large or small: attention to detail was focused on by every staff member, no matter the hour. The hotel is charming and appreciated by staff and guests alike. Enchanting characteristics such as the grand circular staircase, splendid with its red velvet carpets, impeccably clean marble floors and pale yellow and white d\u00e9cor, fresh pink roses in many of the common rooms, the grand piano cherished and previously owned by the founder, freshly made caf\u00e9 lattes accompanying an amazing breakfast, maps with perfect directions, and a caring and knowledgeable concierge staff made for an outstanding stay. They will do just about anything to make your stay memorable. I had asked if the concierge could book train tickets on our behalf for three different destinations and I later found out he was taking his own personal time to pick up the tickets for us from the train station. We started our Italian adventure at the Napoleon in Rome and went on to Venice and Florence. When we returned to the Napoleon days later we felt like we were coming home. We were welcomed back with open arms and the staff were truly interested in hearing if we enjoyed our side-trips. From the moment we entered this lovely, family run establishment we felt safe, respected, cared for and wanted. I have never heard of a hotel inviting guests to a free wine and cheese tasting \u2013 no strings attached, they weren\u2019t selling anything, just welcoming everyone to the hotel and Rome and thanking us for choosing their establishment and sharing that they were honoured to be able to help us have the perfect vacation. All refreshments were free and many staff came and individually welcomed their guests. A retired concierge came to the event each Friday and I believe that says a lot about the type of people who own and provide service in this special hotel - it was like family coming home for a celebration. When staff like and respect each other and treat each other as family, that carries over and guests are afforded the same qualities. The Cioci family have somehow managed to maintain old world qualities with dignity, honesty, caring, and kindness.

The breakfasts are superb and the dinners lovely. Incredibly good value and always highly rated by other travelers.

My wife and I traveled to Rome from September 13th to the 20th, and could not have been happier with our selection of Hotel Napoleon. While I\u2019m sure some of the more negative reviews of the hotel may be true (nobody is perfect), I honestly believe (1) any negative reviews are grossly exaggerated; and/or (2) the person writing it is writing about the wrong hotel. For ease of breaking down the positives and negatives of the hotel, please read the following: Positives 1. Staff \u2013 Everyone and I mean everyone from the Managing Director (Robert Cioce) to the Concierge (Franco Quirinis) to the Bartender (Simone Simeoni) to the Porters are very friendly, helpful, and concerned that your stay at their hotel is enjoyable, comfortable, and relaxing. Very quick and efficient check-in and check-out. 2. Location (also see negative #1) \u2013 Walk outside about 10 feet and you are at the Metro. During the day you are within walking distance to the Coliseum, St. Mary\u2019s (Papal Basilica), St. Johns (Papal Basilica), Ancient Rome, etc. etc. etc. Also there are several small stores near the hotel (you can buy water, beer, wine, fruit, etc. \u2013 very cheap). 3. The Bar \u2013 Reasonable Prices. Very Reasonable Prices, with a good selection of cocktails, snacks, lite meals, and desserts. 4. Wine Tasting \u2013 On Friday nights, the hotel offers a free wine tasting of good local wines. These will not be the best wines ever, but they are good and FREE. Also, Robert Cioce, Managing Director, joins the guest for the tasting, and gives a brief intro to each of the wines. He also makes an effort to meet and greet all their guests that are present. The Wine tasting was a very enjoyable, welcoming experience \u2013 definitely sets this hotel apart from other hotels I have been to (including hotels with free happy hours for executive, reward member guests). 5. Free Breakfast \u2013 Not the best breakfast ever \u2013 but good and FREE. 6. Quick Room Turnover \u2013 Room turnover took around five minutes, and was never poorly performed. 7. Free Wi-Fi (wireless internet) is offered throughout the hotel, and in the lobby. Also in the lobby, if you do not feel like dragging your computer around the globe \u2013 is a general use computer for all guests (just remember it is for everyone \u2013 so share). 8. Restaurant at the Hotel Napoleon \u2013 Good food, charming setting, good service, reasonable prices. Definitely plan on having dinner in the hotel at least one night while in Rome. Negatives (and some suggestions) 1. Location (also see positive #2) \u2013 The areas surrounding the hotel are a little sketchy at night, but still within safe walking distance to several good restaurants (and/or the metro) 2. TV Channels (Suggestion) \u2013 In-room English Speaking channels = 0. The good news? You are in Rome! If you can not find something to do \u2013 ask the concierge. The bad news? Normally by 9pm you are exhausted, and having a TV movie channel to watch and unwind would have made our stay even better. No a big negative, but an areas of suggest improvement. 3. Tours Offerings (Suggestion) \u2013 The concierge books tours through a somewhat more expensive tour agency. While the prices are not outrageous compared to vendors in Rome. Booking online prior to arriving in Rome is cheaper. Worst comes to worst, book your tours online in Rome \u2013 using the Hotel\u2019s free Wi-Fi (and Computer) Overall, both my wife and I were very happy with our selection of the Hotel Napoleon. As with any trip, your level of enjoyment depends on several factors including not just where you go, but also where you stay as well as your level of involvement. With the Hotel Napoleon and the City of Rome you already have two of these three criteria covered \u2013 the rest is up to you. ENJOY! Helpful Hints 1. Facebook \u2013 Not sure how much longer the hotel will be offering this, but if you become a fan of the hotel on Facebook prior to your trip, you can print and present a coupon which will get you a free bottle of sparking wine brought to your room. 2. Metro \u2013 For 16 Euro \u2013 you get unlimited trips for 7 days. Pending where you stay in Rome this could be a great value. If you stay at the Hotel Napoleon \u2013 it will save you tons of money on cabs, buses, etc. Also, because of the way the subway ticket machines are made, you really only need 1 ticket for two people. Just make sure you use the same machine, and use the same ticket over and over. (NOTE the Metro closes at 1130pm on Weekdays and 1230am on Saturdays). 3. 530 \u2013 Great time to go anywhere in Rome. My wife and I were able to get immediately into St. Peters at 530 and had 2 hrs of viewing time \u2013 with only a limited number of other tourists to deal with. 4. Pizza d\u2019 Isla \u2013 Pizzeria - by the Vatican \u2013 Great Value \u2013 Huge Meals - great food. Cheap/good wine. Look it up on-line before going and GO. 5. Get ready to Walk. The cheapest and easiest way to see Rome is to walk. The Hotel Napoleon offers free maps (which come with the tours offered by the concierge) which are very accurate and helpful. Get one and plan on using the metro stops as your stopping points. 6. Stores by the Hotel. When leaving the hotel for whatever reason stores (i.e. for water, snacks, wine) are much cheaper to the right (i.e. $0.75 for a bottle of water compared to $2.50 \u2013 convert into Euros). 7. Coffee Americano \u2013 Note a big espresso drinker? They have coffee Americano at the hotel \u2013 free at breakfast, cheap thereafter.", "Date": "September 29, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne, Australia", "Title": "\u201cFantastic Stay\u201d", "Author": "Panny12", "ReviewID": "UR45450496", "Content": "Had a wonderful stay at the Hotel Napoleon.

It's also only a short walk the Termini. Overall, the hotel was quaint and elegant. The little touches made my stay quite enjoyable.

Hotel Napoleon were very good and gave us a free taxi from the Airport to the Hotel, cost was around 50 Euro on the way back, so quite a saving! As other reviews have said the hotel is within walking distance of the Colosseum. Also the Basilica di San Maria is close by and amazing inside. For other parts of Rome, i.e. Spanish Steps, Trevi fountain it is a longer walk and using the Metro is recommended, the entrance to the Vittorio Emanuele is just outside the hotel. The Metro only costs 1 Euro for a one way trip which is amazing value and although very crowded is easy to use with the main sites of Rome all within 6 stops from the hotel metro and just 2 lines so it is easy to get around without having to refer to the underground maps. Service at the hotel certainly matched the 4* rating of the hotel. Bed sheets and towels were changed everyday. Room was a good size with a large bed. There was a bit of noise from the rooms opposite when people checked in, but apart from that the room was quite enough. The staff were very helpful and pleasent. They have tear away maps on reception to help you find your way around Rome and are happy to help give directions for your day out. The restaurant food was very good both the light meals menu and the main menu. You have to book the restaurant though as it is often full every night. If you want to go out for a meal then the choice of restaurants did seem a bit limited in the area, but we did find a very good one near the Termini station. Because we were staying for a week, the Hotel gave us a free meal one night of the week, you need to inform the staff that you are using it otherwise they will write out a bill and have to cancel it as some other guests found out. The free meal is very generous and includes starter, main course and desert and side courses, the only thing we had to pay for was the drinks. Breakfast was good and offered a wide range, Bacon and scrambled eggs, toast, ham and cheeses, cereal, and cornetto which seems to be a croissant with a cream/jam filling. Also provided fruit juice and very good coffee. With regard to nearby shops, there is a good clothes shop with reasonable prices 2 doors down from the hotel and an ATM machine within 100 yards of the hotel.

They said there was some problem and that the rooms are in the different floors, and that should not be a problem. Well, I\u00b4m the one running stairs up and down for the needs of a youngster and a grandfather, so I clearly stated that for me it is a problem and showed them an email, where they have confirmed me same floor rooms. But without any larger hassle, they upgraded the other room and we were able to stay in the same floor, problem solved! The rooms were OK, except with no view (looking the inner yard), but after all we did came here to visit Rome, not to stay in the hotel. And overall , the price-quality ratio is quite at the point. We really enjoyed the metro station right at the front: no hassle for looking a taxi for 5 persons, but fast and easy and cheap (plus for children exiting) transportation to everywhere. Once we took the tourist bus from vatican area just for fun, and got out at Termini, and five minutes later, we were back at the hotel. And anyway, it was 10-15 minutes (14 euro) taxiride to most of the nice dinner places, and a taxi for five was called by the hotel. One morning I walked with the children to Colosseum for an Ice cream, and it took us 15 minutes, so I was quite surprised how close to everything we actually were. Everybody here mentions the breakfast, which I personnally did not found anything spectular, I guess because of the bread, but the plus was that there were vegetables for my morning sandwich.

It just isn't a really nice part of Rome, that would make you want to walk out and wander around. And, there are very few quality restaurants nearby. That said, the hotel is literally in front of a metro stop. So it is a good base to see Rome because the metro is very convenient, and it is air conditioned which can be a relief from the brutal heat.

I spent there four nights in total: one alone, three with my girlfriend. On the night I spent alone, I stayed in a tiny single room with an appalling interior view. The next day, I went to the reception to ask for the key to the double room where I would stay with my girlfriend, so that I could transfer my luggage from one room to the other. I took my heavy suitcase and five minutes later I was back in the single room to fetch the rest of my stuff. I found the door open, a cleaning lady on all fours wiping the bathroom floor and the room completely empty. I asked her what she was doing there and where my things were and she told me that, as she had seen me go out with my suitcase, she thought I had left, so she put everything she found in the garbage, including a bag with about fifteen different new clothes. She told me she was extremely sorry, but the reception hadn't informed her I was only changing rooms and not leaving for good and that it was quite \"usual\" to find bags full of clothes that people didn't want to take back home. At the end, she managed to separate my clothes from the rest of the bathroom rubbish she had put together and finally gave everything back to me. The double room was a little bit more spacious, but the bathroom had three problems: the toilet was located in front of an incredibly small shower (no bathtub!), and so there was no space for the legs when sitting down. Secondly, there was a leak, and I found a huge puddle of water on the floor when I came back from the first afternoon out. Thirdly, there was absolutely no pressure at all in the flush, which obviously had embarrassing consequences. The first problem had no solution, the second was resolved one day later and the third was not resolved at all. I had explained at the reception that I was going to pick up my girlfriend at the train station and that I wanted the pressure problem to be solved by the time I came back. When I did, the problem hadn't been dealt with yet. The porter who took her suitcase up was informed of the problem and for 15 minutes he tried to fix it while we were there, taking up our scarce time in Rome. He didn't manage and he promised he would try again later. When he left, we finally went to get ready and we left the room. At night, when we came back, the problem hadn't been solved and several utensils were scattered around the dirty floor. The rooms, besides, were extremely old-fashioned and uncomfortable, in desperate need of total refurbishment.

A walk to the second floor reveals a very pleasant old world lobby/lounge complete with vintage artwork.

The clientele seems to be mostly British & American tourists. Roberto Lombardi was the concierge on duty when I arrived unnanounced he was able to provide a room at a fair price and the service was great. He was able to magically create a parking space and find a carpark, a good dinner recommendation and suggested a great late night walk to the Colloseum. He and all of the staff here really went out of their way to be helpful. The shower was tiny, but the room was comfortable, the price was right. Internet was slow but FREE and breakfast was decent and included. This hotel is good, and the price and service are great.

Big spacious bathroom with bathtub, not the usual claustrophobic shower cabins that an adult can barely stand in.

Staff --> EVERYBODY was very polite and ready to help whatever the problem/need was, very friendly, kind of a \"family\" atmosphere and at the same time very professional staff. The room was booked several months before and every little detail was taken care of exactly as promised in the initial emails that we exchanged with the hotel management (for example, the car that, when leaving, would carry as from the hotel to the Fumicino airport was fixed in February, when we booked the room, at a certain price for the morning of the 22nd of June and it was right there waiting for us!) Location --> What can I say? The Metro station is at the doorstep of the hotel, we could not ask for anything more since we had only 3 days available to see as much of Rome as we could. Some previous reviewers mentioned that they spotted a few \"suspicious\" guys on the nearby area but, hey, we are talking about the metro of a big metropolis, it's no different than any other similar place. At no moment we felt uncomfortable or unsafe. Another big plus was the fact that round the corner there were two trattorias (neighborhood restaurants) with very good food and extremely reasonable prices, a big advantage especially on Sundays when most of the downtown restaurants are closed. Other --> Restaurant, bar (with small/light dinner) and a cozy leaving room with TV and an Internet spot were all operating/in order, just keep in mind that we are not talking about anything fancy or gourmet considering the food, it is just an effortless solution when you are too tired to get out and start looking for a restaurant.

The hotel is located in a working-class, non-touristy neighborhood with good restaurants (RomAntica) and gelato (Il Palazzo del Freddo) nearby. We never felt unsafe in this area, even when returning on the Metro very late at night or when taking an evening stroll. The Metro is literally a few steps from the front door of the hotel, making it very easy to get around Rome and to the train station. The hotel is clean, furnished with antiques, and decorated in the lavish Italian style. Another plus: the common areas and guest rooms are very quiet. The guest rooms face an interior courtyard so one does not have to deal with the usual city/traffic noise that you find in other hotels in a large city. Our room was spacious, clean, and comfortable with a great terrace that overlooked the courtyard. It was quite pleasant to sit on the terrace after a busy day of sightseeing and enjoy a glass of wine. The rooms are also equipped with free Wi-Fi. This was a nice feature for my daughter with her iPod, allowing her to keep in touch with her friends via email. The hotel staff members are fine examples of great customer service in action. It seems that they all enjoy their jobs and truly care about the comfort of their guests. The housekeepers were friendly and kept our room spotless, providing fresh linens every day. The restaurant staff at breakfast kept everything tidy and addressed our every need. We did not eat dinner at the hotel restaurant but the daily breakfast was wonderful: items included traditional European breakfast items, American eggs and bacon, as well as fruits, vegetables, and heavenly Italian pastries. It was all fresh and delicious. The gentlemen who staff the concierge and reception desks speak excellent English and were most helpful and attentive to any need or question we had. There is a wonderful wine reception on Friday evenings where you can meet other guests as well as spend time getting to know the hotel staff. We had the pleasure of meeting Mr. Roberto Cioce, the general manager of the hotel, and were able to spend time getting to know him during our stay at the hotel. After our time with Mr. Cioce, it was quite apparent to us that his passion for excellence and service is what fuels his staff to do such an amazing job. Mr. Cioce worked with us prior to our arrival and continued working on our behalf after we arrived to arrange an important educational experience for our daughter. At times, it seemed like this opportunity would not come to fruition, but Mr. Cioce persisted and he was able to arrange an amazing experience for our daughter.

The cheap metro tickets (\u20ac1) allow you to travel around Rome for 75 minutes - but it only takes you approx. 10 minutes to the most famous spots, e.g. the Spanish Steps. If you don't want to use the Metro, you can walk to the Colosseum and the Forum Romanum within 20 minutes! The staff of the Hotel are all extremely friendly and helpful (if you need a transport to the airport or have questions about other spots, don't hesitate to ask them). The breakfast buffet offers you a wide range of choice from scrambled ham and eggs over differents pastries to cereals. The rooms are cleaned daily, and the bed linen and towels are also changed on a daily basis. A big advantage of the rooms facing the interiour court is the silence during nighttime: you can sleep with your windows open ( if you don't like the air conditioner) and you don't hear any noise from the streets. And after a day of walking around Rome to see all the famous sights, you are very grateful if you can go to sleep in a clean and quiet room, knowing you're well taken care off in this fantastic hotel!

The staff are all very friendly & the concierge were always very helpful. Marta, who organised the reception was wonderful, anything we needed she was able to advise us on. The banquet hall was made out beautifully for us, & the food, amazing, not one of our guests complained about the food, or the wine for that matter!! We set up our ipod for music after the meal, they left their sound system ready for us, don't think they were expecting the party they got though :-) The situation of the hotel is in a bit of a run down area, but never once did I feel unsafe. The park across the road from it was luvly, we strolled through there a number of times to get the baby to sleep! We had 1 complaint about our room, and that was you could hear next doors toilet flushing, but that's it! We were upgraded as we were having our reception there, which had great space. Some of our guests rooms were small, but not tiny, when you go to an ancient city you don't go to stay in your room all day! Though they did feel that they should have got more for their money! All rooms were made up each day with fresh towels & bedding. Each morning we filled up on breakfast, a good selection of bread, croissants, eggs, bacon, fruit & yougurt, cold ham & cheese. We had snacks from the bar during the day, but mostly ate out elsewhere in the evening as there are so many nice places to eat! The Metro is right outside the door, but we walked everywhere as we had our little girl in a buggy! Everything is within walking distance, once you don't mind a good walk! If you get tired you can always pop in to get a glass of wine & a rest :-) Overall, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay & would definitely return to the hotel, make sure you stay on a Friday night for the wine tasting evening, a very personal touch from the hotels owner!", "Date": "May 21, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "bath", "Title": "\u201cTen out of Ten\u201d", "Author": "texarkana336", "ReviewID": "UR30377198", "Content": "Thankyou Tripadviser, We never stay anywhere now without first checking out the hotel on tripadviser.

The hotel had some good points but unfortunately some key areas require improvement. On the plus side, all the staff was extremely polite and helpful. They were also very accommodating at the front desk if you needed to print something or require information on tourist attractions. However, we were provided with wrong directions and were sent to the completely wrong area of town after asking for the shopping mall Porta di Roma. As a result, we were out a couple of Euros but most importantly we wasted some 3 precious hours of our last day in Rome because of the wrong information we were given. The breakfast had some pretty good variety and was nice. A bouquet of roses for our 15th anniversary was a nice touch. The location is probably its best asset since the Metro is right outside. On the negative side, the washroom is very small with a narrow bath tub and no counter space; only a small shelf over the bidet. This aside, the biggest problem with the room was its cleanliness, or lack of. The washroom was mouldy and the room was filthy. There were a film of dust on every piece of furniture and many stains on the carpet throughout the room. In fact, we did not even unpack our suitcases and always wore slippers in the room. The furniture was also very dated and shows significant wear and tear and there was quite a funky smell in the room which was not pleasant at all and quite a turn off. I have a bunch of pictures of the room; you can send me a note if you want to see them. Room cleaning was very poor as well as they seem to only make up the bed and replace the towels otherwise the bathroom was untouched and this became a hygiene issue.

We were able to sleep peacefully through the night. The hotel staff for the most part were friendly and helpful. Breakfast was satisfying and offered many choices. I usually had juice, coffee, a hard boiled egg, a roll ( or pastry) and yogurt. My husband preferred making a sandwich of cold cuts.

I honestly don\u2019t know what planet these reviewers are from. I think that this hotel was heinously over priced. It is true that the hotel is conveniently situated right next to a metro station which is great because, trust me, you don\u2019t want to hang about in this area for too long! There are a lot of unsavoury characters who lurk around outside the station in the evening. There is a park across the road from the hotel. It seems to be quite a popular hang out for drunks, vagrants and various other men who enjoy leering at young women. I felt extremely unsafe and uncomfortable. I would not recommend this hotel, particularly if you are a young woman travelling alone. In my opinion, the area surrounding the hotel was an absolute ghetto. It is dilapidated, filthy and covered in graffiti. The hotel was very clean, particularly the bathrooms. The style of the hotel reminded me of my great grandmother\u2019s house. I\u2019m sure that she would have loved the garish patterned fabrics, bric-a-brac furniture and wall-mounted pictures depicting cats and kittens. The pillows in the bedroom were rock solid. We had to ask the concierge for others which were a little softer. I don\u2019t understand why softer pillows weren\u2019t in the room in the first place. I am sure that almost all their guests must request them. There was no tea/coffee making facilities in the room which I found unusual for a 4 star hotel. The hairdryer was a Health & Safety Inspector\u2019s worst nightmare. It was wall-mounted in the bathroom and looked like an industrial vacuum. The handle of the hairdryer becomes extremely hot after just a few minutes of use. I had to wrap a towel around it to save my hand from burning. If you do decide to stay at this hotel, then please take your own hairdryer rather than use their wall-mounted monstrosity! The food in the hotel was absolutely appalling. I ordered a salmon sandwich. There seemed to be more margarine on the bread that there was salmon. One salmon sandwich and a handful of iceberg lettuce cost 7 euros! I don\u2019t understand how they can justify charging that. The service was excruciatingly slow. Even though we were the only people in the restaurant, we waited 20 minutes for a sandwich. That being said, the breakfast at the hotel was fairly good. They offer a wide selection in the buffet. My only complaint was that both the orange juice and the fruit salad were not fresh (they use diluted orange juice and tinned fruit salad). I think that for the exorbitantly high price you are paying them, they could at least stretch to using fresh produce. The Concierge, Franco, was very helpful and courteous. However, one of the other Concierges was unbelievably rude to me and my partner. We asked to buy two metro tickets. These cost 4 euros each. I gave him a 20 euro note (as I did not have any smaller bills). He angrily stated that he did not have any change and snapped that he \u201cdid not have time for this\u201d. So, we had to wait until Franco returned to reception to give us our change. I would recommend that you purchase your metro passes from the machines at the station as they are the same price.

The breakfast they have for guests in the mornings are extensive and we were spoilt for choice. They had everything! The food at the restaurant was wonderful and well priced.

It is definitely a nice way to get to know the people that greet you when you sit down for breakfast, or as you come in through the door from being out all day. Roberto, the owner, also comes along to meet the hotel guests but the greatest thing is to see how proud he feels of his staff and his hotel.

I am very pleased to say that the Napoleon fitted this brief absolutely perfectly and offered lots more besides... The location was perfect - just under 10 minutes walk from the main railway station, just over 10 minutes walk to the Colosseum and a further 5 - 10 minutes walk to most of the other main attractions. We happily walked everywhere (with 2 small children) with the exception of the Vatican City which being the other side of the river was slightly too far. But just across the pavement from the hotel entrance is the metro which quickly takes you to a station just 5 minutes walk from the Vatican. The area itself was absolutely fine - no worse than anywhere else in Rome with a nice square just over the road. We had a great welcome on our arrival, there was a bunch of flowers in the room and a chilled bottle of Italian sparkling wine was brought up with a note to celebrate our anniversiary. The room was large - split in two with a dividing curtain with the double bed on one side and the children's two singles on the other. The bathroom was clean and modern with plenty of toiletries. There was a fridge/minabar with plenly of space for storing your own water etc. and the TV had four English language channels, BBC world, Sky and two American ones. The room also overlooked an internal courtyard which was great as there was no noise and the windows could be left open for air (there was also air conditioning if required.) Breakfast was a fantastic selection of the usual juice, cereal, fruits, rolls, cold cheeses and meats but also hot bacon, scrambled eggs and beans plus the biggest choice of cakes imaginable. On top of this, on Easter Sunday, there was an addition \"traditional Italian Easter\" selection of breads, cakes, salami and mini Easter eggs for the children which the waiters also brought round and offered. On arrival we were offered tea, any type of coffee we wanted (we had capuccio and latte) or hot chocolate (which the kids loved). There is a bar offering light meals throughout the day and a restaurant offering more elaborate meals in the evening. We had a bar meal the first evening and ate in the restaurant on the last night and the food was reasonably priced and as good as any we had anywhere else in Italy. And we were offered a glass of complimentary desert wine and biscuits afterwards! There is a large comfortable lounge with a desk and computer with free internet access in one corner. Although well used we had no problem getting on it most times we wanted to. On the Thursday night (normally Fridays but changed due to Good Friday) the hotel Manager hosted a local wine and food tasting session which we really enjoyed (the salami being the best I've ever had) and the kids were well looked after getting their own basket of crisps and choice of soft drinks. There were a very large range of people staying, older and younger couples and families of many nationalities. The staff were all extemely friendly and helpful and most could speak very good English - would particularly mention Franco for the patient way he dealt with our queries on reception and Simone for the effortless way he served us in the bar in the evening and then at breakfast the next morning! Overall a fantastic stay - I have stayed at many hotels and would rate it one of the best; my wife said it was definitely the best hotel she had ever stayed at and we would certainly be back if/when we are ever in Rome again. The best rates we could find were on the hotels own website (where they have special offers) and booking there also meant a virtually instant personal confirmation. For customer care and value for money I think the Napolean would be very, very hard to beat.", "Date": "April 17, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Southwest, USA", "Title": "\u201cConcierge Wins the Day\u201d", "Author": "ERaphael", "ReviewID": "UR27476163", "Content": "Airport pickup & being greeted by the concierge was a nice touch. Truly, Franco (I believe was his name) makes up for some of the smaller things that might have been more troubling had the service not been so excellent. Both Franco and the other gentleman (older) were wonderful. Franco, in particular, seems to go out of his way to make guests feel welcome. I can't say enough about how wonderful the service was at this level! The younger concierge was mostly fine except he didn't bother with coffee and croissants for our early morning departure (we didn't ask for this service but were told the evening before that we would receive it). The morning we left, he was smoking outside the entrance doors. The smokey air then made its way up the stairwell and into the lounge. Slightly distasteful, in my opinion. I'm also not sure about his English, as we thought there was a slight discrepancy with our bill and never really felt that was resolved. In addition to that, when we asked if the cost of the transfer had been included on the bill, he had said yes. Except when we arrived at the airport with the driver demanded 50 euros. We didn't see the charge on the bill - though we couldn't make sense of it, as there was a dinner charge on there that shouldn't have been. That's our fault for not clearing it up before we left though. Incidentally, not a friendly driver. There's a language barrier, but friendliness crosses all languages. I don't need effusive gestures of good will and friendliness, but some basic courtesy wouldn't go amiss. The service overall was outstanding. The Friday evening wine tasting was really a nice touch. All of the other staff were cordial and went out of their way to be helpful. The housekeeping staff on our floor were also exceptionally nice. We did not love the location of the hotel. The surrounding neighborhood is not my favorite in Rome; however, you are only steps to the metro which will take you anywhere you want to go in Rome. It's also quite close to Termini. (You can decide for yourself whether that is a pro or a con...for me it is a con because they neighborhood is sort of dodgy.) Still, being steps from the metro was incredibly convenient and almost makes up for the other negative aspects of the location. There are several nice, little places closeby to eat...but you'll probably want to go farther afield for nicer dining experiences. Our room was very clean and well kept. Our view was out onto other buildings, but it was very quiet (the quietest hotel I've stayed at in Italy, in fact). But, as others have noted, the walls are thin...even to the point where you can hear words of conversations...television...people putting clothes on hangers. One time I woke up and asked if someone was in our closet...it was our neighbor in his own closet, but I could have sworn it was in our room. Despite this, I slept well at the hotel for the most part. External city noise, or construction have blighted all of my other stays in Italy...there was none of that here. I found the mattresses and pillows to be comfortable, too, and I'm picky. I was really comfortable in our room and outside of the occasional noisy neighbor within the hotel, I really liked our room. The lounges and the bar are very comfortable and nice. It's very convenient to be able to use the Internet in the lounge; however, if you don't bring your own computer, good luck. I had to check emails in the morning or daytime hours, as the computer was always occupied from early evening until quite late at night. I wouldn't call that a negative though, as it was just nice to be able to use the computer at all and I didn't have a problem accessing the Internet during \"off\" times when others were out sightseeing, etc. I'd say Napolean Hotel is a safe pick. The surrounding neighborhood leaves something to be desired, but you can quickly connect to anywhere in the city - or the rest of Europe - from this location. And, Franco and most of the other hotel staff are second to none in terms of hospitality...which will go a long way toward making your stay a happy, comfortable one! I would have given full marks for service had it not been for the issues with check out, etc. on the morning we left...unfortunately, that did put a slight damper on our overall impression of the hotel. Oh, we ate at the hotel twice. Once: pizza. Not good. Second time: at the restaurant. Very good fish & ravioli. Service was incredibly slow though. There was a very large party dining at the same time as us and we found the service to be rather inattentive as they were occupied with the large group. The discrepancy in our bill was that it showed three meals when we had only eaten two there. Again, our fault for not clearing it up before leaving. Overall, I would probably recommend the hotel.", "Date": "April 5, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Palmetto, Florida", "Title": "\u201cTrip of a lifetime\u201d", "Author": "WorkToTravel75", "ReviewID": "UR27417975", "Content": "Mr. Cioce and his staff should be commended for their outstanding service.

We decided on this hotel because of previous reviews on Trip Advisor and were not disappointed. As previously mentioned the hotel staff are extremely helpful and friendly and were always on hand to assist whenever needed. On our anniversary we were kindly presented with complimentary flowers and wine, most unexpected and gratefully received (thank you very much). The room was very comfortable, clean and spacious. It was also quiet with no traffic noise (we had the windows open at night) but there was no view as you over look a courtyard. The Hotel has a lovely lounge area, where you can relax with a coffee. Breakfast is the usual continental fayre, buffet style. It was the same everyday but there was a lot of variety to choose from. The hotel restaurant was also very good. I would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel to my friends and family. Some of the comments mention that the hotel is in a seedy area and not central. I have to admit that this nearly stopped us booking this hotel but in our experience, once we accepted that it seemed normal for young people to \"hang around\" in the streets chatting, we became more confident and traveled around at night on the streets and metro with no problems. Rome does have a problem with graffiti but it is everywhere not just around the hotel. There is a metro station just outside the entrance to the hotel and for 1 euro you can travel anywhere by metro or bus for 75mins or 24 hours for 4 euro. We also got the City Sight Seeing bus tour for 12 euros each and it lasted 48 hours. We therefore used this to hop on and off over 2 days to see all the sights. Obviously, there are numerous sights to see in Rome and all are not to be missed. However, just a couple of things we discovered, one was the baths (Terme di Caracalla), they are not central but are well worth a visit, my husband and I were quite astounded as to how big and well preserved they were - a pleasant surprise. Another surprise was the roof top view from the Vittoriano building we stumbled across this. It does cost 7 euros but some say it is a better and more central view of Rome than the view from the dome of St Peter's Basilica. For those with a problem with heights and walking up loads of steps (I am one of those and took a lot of persuasion) it isn't too scary, there is a lift right to the top and once I had recovered from the lift journey I felt quite comfortable looking at the view and walking around. Of course Rome like all European cities I would imagine is quite expensive at the moment due to the exchange rate of the pound, on average we spent 45 euro on a meal for two including drinks.

Therefore I rate this hotel as average... First the good points... A reasonably priced hotel. I really enjoyed the wine tasting they host on Friday afternoon. The hotel owner/general manager was charming and it the type of welcoming atmosphere you would expect from a family run hotel. The breakfast was great, lovely waitstaff and wonderful selection (fruits, cereals, pastries, meats and cheeses, all types of coffees... etc.). Some other good points... Hotel had charming lobby with convenient/quaint hotel bar with friendly barstaff, selection of international newspapers, a small charming park/square across the street, convenient subway station right outside, and the desk staff/concierge can be charming and helpful but this depends on who you approach and what you are asking for (they are especially helpful for sightseeing information). Now the bad points... \"NO\" seems to be the hotel's favorite word. This is a no frills hotel. It has no view, no courtyard, and no extras from what I already mentioned. Also, don't expect any of your requests to be heard. We were there for 4 nights/5 days and we were put in what I think was the worse room in the hotel - 1st floor, dark, corner room, next to a utility room, window view of a brick wall, and NOISY (you could hear everything from our room - hotel staff, people in the hallway, people from the building next door.. etc.). When asked if we could move to a different room - we were told NO and that was all they had available (which I knew to be untrue). The room had no light and the air was stagnant which was made worse by the air con/ventilation not working - when we asked if they could do something about fixing it we were once again told \"No\". I would think that if you had guests paying for 4 nights, you would want to keep them satisfied but this just was not our experience. Also, take my advice and don't ask the front desk for restaurant suggestions. We were referred to an overpriced restaurant that served the worse Italian food I have ever tasted. During our stay, we actually found a much more elegant , family-owned restaurant with excellent food that actually cost 20% less than the one we were sent to - so you are better off finding a restaurant on your own. The only other bad points that I have to add is that although the hotel interior is charming it needs to be refreshed - its showing some wear and tear and it can be a walk to the major sites (I prefer to be in the heart of it). I loved Italy and plan on returning for another visit - Unfortunately I don't think we will be staying back at the Napoleon. Only because I am willing to pay more to get the extras I expect from a hotel - a spectacular room with a view, a courtyard or roof terrace, in the heart of major sites... etc. But I would suggest this hotel for people who want clean, charming hotel and some nice added extras without breaking the bank.

Buffet breakfast fine & usual stuff you get in Europe. Water not hot enough for tea though!

Local wine here also good. Heading in direction of colosseum from hotel, take first left off Via Labicana (by San Clemente - go there it's well worth the 3 euros to see the underground churches too!), turn left and a few yards up on the left. Trattoria Luzzi: Stumbled across this on a corner off Via dei San Giovanni. Turn left off Via Labicana by San Clemente, turn right onto San Giovanni & look out for the green trattoria/ pizzeria sign on a corner of a side street on the left. Gets very busy and some queing but full of locals & tourists alike, good home cooking. Great wood burning ovened pizza & pasta. Cheap as chips this place. Not so great on service - one night perfect but another 20mins between my dish & my husbands but the food was freshly made (including the pasta), and the atmosphere & price was well worth it! Note - no pizza at lunchtimes! Travel to the hotel - from Fiumicino airport get Leonardo Express 12 euros nonstop to Termin, Line A metro 1 stop to Vittorio Emanuale.

The prices in the restaurant, bar and for room service were very resonable. We had to leave to catch our flight before breakfast opened on monday, and the hotel opened the breakfast room early for us. Breakfast was the typical European breakfast and included Bacon and hot eggs. The Friday night \"meet the manager\" reception was nice with free wine and snacks. This is a TRUE family run hotel. The manager was glad to have our business. I caution the North American readers to remember that this is NOT a hotel in the United States. It might not seem as nice as your typical chain hotel, but it's a great find for a hotel in Italy. I can't even begin to to tell you how happy we were with the customer service. The walls are a little thin, and you can hear some of the action around you and above you. Wi-Fi was free, and the signal was great. It was really fast.

I went out to Rome to visit my sister who was attending the American University of Rome and took a lot of time reading reviews and checking out mulitiple hotels before I picked Napoleon thanks to trip advisor. The hotel is nice and on a quiet strip. The rooms are average for Italy and are clean. The hotel staff is very pleasant and helpful. I had arranaged for a driver to pick me up at the airport and even though a tour was not part of the pick up service the driver happily showed me around some of the sights as well as gave me some pointers on some Italian vocabulary. I had arranged for a twin room for my first two weeks of stay and then an upgrade the third week when my mother came out. At check in the manager upgraded my room from the start at no extra charge so that I would not have to change rooms mid stay. Over the three weeks I got to know the staff at the hotel pretty well and each was always pleasant. They were very helpful in a stressful situation in which I had to take my sister to the local hospital (they made sure to speak with the Taxi driver when he arrived to translate). The hotel does have free wifi from your room but make sure to get a password from the front desk, and the rooms have air conditioning. They also have a complimentary breakfast each morning with a decent selection. I also found it very helpful that the rooms have a safe and when you went out for the day you could leave your room key at the front desk. They hotel is walking distance from the Coloseum as long as you dont mind walking up hill to get back to the hotel. For the Trevi Fountain and Spanish Steps it is best to take the bus or a Taxi.

We selected it on the basis of the very favorable reviews the hotel has received on TripAdvisor, but I was somewhat puzzled by the absence of reviews in most travel books. I'm still not sure why it's not written up more, but I think that the positive reviews it gets here are very well deserved. The Napoleon is a family-run hotel, and while that in itself doesn't guarantee particularly good service, the owners and staff clearly do care very much about their guests. Everyone was extremely attentive, and the owners demonstrated their concern by sending e-mails both before and after our stay, and by hosting a very nice wine-and-cheese event in the bar (which I understand they do every week). We only ate in the hotel restaurant once, but the food was well-prepared and moderately priced. We found the breakfast buffet to be just right, providing more than enough choice for us without being excessive (and thereby raising the room rates). This being a mid-range hotel in an older building--are there any buildings in central Rome less than 75 years old?--the rooms may not be up to Hilton standards. They are clean, and the bathrooms are quite modern, but they are not as sound-proofed as they might be, and the standard rooms are really quite small. The common areas are surprisingly spacious and well-appointed, although the (retrofitted?) elevators/lifts are tiny. Taking everything into account, the Napoleon probably rates about a 4.5 out of 5, rather than 5 out of 5. Rated strictly on appearances and physical attributes, it may not even reach 4 out of 5, but the care and concern demonstrated by the management and staff push my rating right up to 5. I highly recommend the Hotel Napoleon. Here are a few tips that could be useful in planning a stay at the Napoleon: - Book through the hotel website directly, rather than Expedia, Hotels.com, etc. We got a much better deal this way: www.napoleon.it; - Splurge and go for the Superior room. Whether or not it's worth it is naturally subjective, but I recommend it; - If you arrive in Rome from Fiumicino, you can take the train to Termini station and the Metro to the door of the hotel for a total of \u20ac12. but DON'T consider it unless you're able to negotiate a couple flights of steps in the Metro; - You really can walk to most of the key places in Rome from the hotel, but you'll probably wear yourself out doing it. If you don't want to use taxis, buy a bus map from a newstand, since the Roman bus system is totally inscrutable to the newcomer. Yet the Metro is somewhat limited in its destinations. Moreover, while reasonably safe, it's insanely crowded most of the time. Both the buses and Metro are \u20ac1 a trip, or \u20ac4 a day, which is very economical, but the buses are the better bet. Several useful lines stop at Santa Maria Maggiore, two or three blocks from the hotel; - The entire staff deserve generous tips--really--but DON'T wait until you check out, thinking that you'll add a tip to your final bill. For some reason, the hotel has no way to handle this, full stop. So if you don't want to leave feeling like you've stiffed all those helpful people, you'll have to tip as you go.", "Date": "February 19, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dublin, Ireland", "Title": "\u201cDiamond in the Rough\u201d", "Author": "Ksam007", "ReviewID": "UR24790630", "Content": "When I say diamond in the rough I mean that I would consider the area in which this hotel is based (reasonably close to the train station) to be less than salubrious but the location (in terms of being central and having access to all areas) was great, I wouldnt have any issues walking in the area at any hour and the hotel had a great attitude towards customer service. I have travelled a fair bit in my day and I dont get upset when say a shower curtain fails down or the water isnt quite hot enough, etc. What I do value is a good customer focused service and this hotel has it right. Very helpful staff (particularly the guys on the desk - for giving directions, advise, arranging dinners, etc). We were invited to a wine tasting session in the bar on the Friday night which was good fun. The manager was there and made a point of talking to everyone (genuinely and having a laugh). I got the impression from him and his staff that there is enormous pride in the place and the service they provide. We were over for an international rugby match and were all invited back for a drink in the hotel the following evening after the game (the first round on the management, the second aswell if Italy won - that case of drink was safe).

In October 2008 we booked 2 superior rooms for 5 nights in February 2009. We chose this hotel because the Hotel web site said the extra large superior rooms had lounge and sleeping areas seperated by a curtain. This was ideal as our husbands like to sleep late and we like to get up early without disturbing them. When we arrived the rooms were smaller than expected and had no seperated areas. As we'd booked such a long time ago we thought maybe we'd made a mistake and at the earliest opportunity checked the web site to find we were correct and the rooms were of a lower standard than expected. The sunny courtyard views were non existent, ours was of a huge ugly fire escape. We asked the front desk about the room and he didn't seem suprised and told us to speak to the concierge the next morning which we did. He first told us the rooms were superior but then admitted they were standard and agreed that we would be charged the standard rate only, a difference of 15 Euros a night. He was abrupt and offered no apology or explanation. We would have preferred to pay the full rate and have the correct room but we are fairly laid back people and decided not to let it spoil our holiday. When we paid our bill at the end the Manager/Owner was on the desk and said we shouldn't have the discount because the rooms were superior. He then saw our bill had already been adjusted and so we paid the agreed discounted rate. He was rude when we asked to see the calculations and said it wasn't complicated although he had to use a calculator himself to check it. He insulted our intelligence and what annoyed us what that if we hadn't said anything they would have charged us the full rate anyway so we felt they were prepared to cheat guests rather than admit they'd made a mistake on our booking. In all other respects the Hotel is lovely, one of the few to have a lounge, bar and restaurant with room service too. The employees were polite and friendly and made us feel very welcome, and the rooms were always beautifully cleaned each day. We asked for feather pillows and they were provided immediately.

The friday evening party is cheese and wine and italian nibbles and was really good, the owner / manager gives a little speech welcoming everyone to his hotel and as a wow factor ... makes his own olive oil it tastes amazing.

The choice proved more than happy. As one who spent many years travelling, I cannot speak too highly of the Hotel Napoleon and in particular of its staff. One really does feel that nothing is too much trouble for them. Part of the deal was for a car to meet us at the airport, which takes much of the anxiety out of arrival. All the staff greet one with a smile whenever they pass and - strangely affecting in this mechanical age - the concierge effortlessly calls one by name as one leaves and collects one\u2019s key. The Hotel Napoleon is not part of an impersonal chain; it's a single hotel, owned and run by a family and it feels like it. There is no hint of standard furnishings or fittings or decorations. The staff are not shipped in and out from central casting. In each lift there is a pictorial staff list showing each member from the director to the porters, which suggests a happy ship with a low staff turnover. There is none of the condescension that often haunts the service offered by the grander hotels. The public rooms are spacious and welcoming and beautifully furnished. The bedrooms, I guess, are all individually furnished in domestic style. Ours had, amongst other things, a writing desk with a folding top and a three door free-standing wardrobe. The television was adequate and polyglot (if you are seriously watching TV in Rome, something is wrong somewhere). The breakfast buffet was extensive and catered for all tastes, mine included.

The Napoleon Hotel became a \u201cHome from Home\u201d for us our family & friends. Our 34 guests all stayed at this hotel to celebrate our Special Day. The Hotel took care of our every need. Everything was organised for us, from the moment that we arrived to the Hotel by courtesy Airport pick up, we were warmly welcomed by Roberto the Manager who assured us all would be perfect for the Big Day, and he wasn't wrong, It was spectacular! When we arrived to our Nuptial suite we were welcomed by a beautiful bouquet of fresh flowers, with a Bottle of Champagne chilling for us. It was just amazing. Our guests also received continuous first class service, from individual courtesy airport collection, to excellent accommodation & central location, with the metro outside your door step, our guests had the freedom to Roam around Rome, they received sound tourist advice & transport tips, moreover, any special Dietary requirements were prepared & catered for. It was great peace of mind for both us & our guests, we were all overwhelmed by the service, it was second to none. My Family & friends would highly recommend this Hotel they are still raving about the Hotel & their stay in Rome. On the days leading up to our Wedding, Martha the Hotels Wedding coordinator helped to arrange all our Wedding Reception plans, and without hesitation she had organised everything for us, from the Table Flower arrangements to the Wedding Bouquets, menu design, table layout, the banquet & reception preparation, Jazz Band & afters music was booked & confirmed, Hairdresser & Make up appointments were also confirmed, she even pre-ordered our cake weeks in advance, a fabulous 3 Tier cake which surpassed any expectations that we had & it tasted as delicious as it looked! Everything was chosen to match our Wedding colours; even the iced flowers on the caked matched the Bridal flower bouquets. It was spectacular; all was perfect right down to the very last detail. The Restaurant & Bar staff also provided excellent service, they even pre-order favourite foods & beverages for some of our guests. Moreover, all our requirements were catered for. I have to state from the moment we arrived to the moment we left we were treated like Royalty, it was remarkable from begin to end.

From its great location, metro outside the door (A line), or 10/15 walk from Termini, with lots of moderately priced restaurants and bars in the locale, to staff who take genuine pride in their job, to a warm and welcoming interior, it would be hard to beat this hotel. Honestly, in this fast paced world where the customer service standards have fallen in the hospitality industry, its so refreshing to see that the management of this hotel strive to give each and every guest a memorable stay. Fancy this......staff who make eye contact, share a warm smile, offer a greeting each time you/they pass by, seem happy in their job - don't see much of this anymore. Hotel was impecably clean, even the guest bathroom in the lounge was hard to beat! You can tell the owners employ the very best here, no short cuts. Breakfast is a buffet offering cheeses & meats, cereals, yogurts, juices, scrambled eggs and bacon, delicious breads and assorted cakes and pastries. Choice of types of coffee and teas. Bar is very well stocked with top quality spirits and wines and very well priced. To reach hotel from Termini, take the A metroline one stop or take a pleasant 15 minute walk. The metros cost \u20ac1 per person for upto 75 minutes of travel or \u20ac4 for a day. Hotel Napoleon is a 5 minute walk from the coliseum. We spent Sat & Sun walking Rome visit sites, hoping on and off the metro when tiring. On another note wouldn't be bothered taking a taxi from ciampino airport - take a shuttle bus for \u20ac11 return into Termini, a 40 minute journey, we used www.sitbusshuttle.com - no need to book online just buy ticket at desk in arrivals or pay staff member at stop #3 outside arrivals terminal. Lots of people use the train and metro combination, cheaper but takes longer. In less than 48 hours one can litterally achieve a huge amount of sight seeing, the Vatican Museum/St Peter's including climbing the Dome, Coliseum and Forum, Trevi Fountain, Panetheon and Spanish steps can all be covered, and that includes plenty of cappuchino stops!! Dining out in Rome doesn't have to be expensive - there are literally hundreds and hundreds of great places, the fun is checking them out. For the best galati (ice cream) a stop at Blue Ice Cream is a must, my mouth is watering at the memories. They are dotted around Rome central, we visited the one at Campi Di Fiori, which is great spot for street entertainment while sipping a nice wine, eating delicious ice cream and great markets oh and lovely shops.

The hotel is a nice and comfortable establishment but nothing special and perhaps more 3 star than 4 star. My room was fine and clean and of a traditional size for an old building. The furniture was a bit dated as was the shower in my bathroom. As for the bathroom it was small and crammed with all of the usual convenience's. So much so it could be a hazard for anyone slightly overweight, they could easily become wedged between the huge washbasin and shower cubicle and need to be freed by the Roman fire brigade. The rest of the hotel is clean and has a historical ambience so much so the BBC could easily film here another series of Miss Marple or anything else from the 1950's. Loaction wise the Hotel is a good choice, indeed there is a Metro station outside which is ideal for getting around this great city. The general area around the hotel is not as beautiful as other area's of Rome but neither is it a slum area as other contributors have implied. As for the staff well with the exception of a very helpful and cheerful Swedish girl who worked at breakfast time I found none of the other staff to be exceptionally friendly or helpfull.

Probably the only down side is the area as it seems a little run down but has everything close by and there are some restaurants close by. It is very close to the colloseum which we visited every day and was the main reason we went. The staff are friendly and assisted us when we asked. Breakfast was absolutely fantastic. All in all we enjoyed the hotel it was our first time in Italy and we would return to the hotel. Dont know if it is permanent but the metro shuts early so makes it a bit difficult to go anywhere too far in the evening unless you get taxis but then becomes expensive. A tip for families with young children make sure you go to the Explora which is a museum dedicated to children (you cant go in unless you have a child!) It is non profit making and is on Via Flaminia 82 close to Piazza del Popolo. It is absolutely fantastic one of the best places we have taken our son, he loved it.

The Metro line is right outside the door for easy transport to almost any sight in Rome, and the Train Station for trips outside of Rome is about five minutes away by foot, or one metro stop away. The location simply could not have been better. The hotel was very quiet and allowed for very peaceful nights. I simply do not agree with any review that says the location was not good. It was perfect. My husband and I had a superior double room and it was extremely large, comfortable, and clean. Our room had a television, its own remote control air-conditioning unit, and a refrigrator, which made keeping snacks very convenient. Everything in our room was in working order and we had clean sheets and towels every day. Something that doesn't necessarily happen in other hotels. The bathroom was large with a big tub with shower, sink, toilet, bidet, good lighting, a wall mounted hairdryer, and a good selection of toiletries were also provided. A Buffet breakfast was included in the price of our room and it was quite lovely. There was a nice selection of cereal, hard boiled or scrambled eggs, bacon, cold cuts, cheeses, yogurt, fresh fruit, breads, pastries, juices, coffees and teas. We ate our breakfast every morning at the hotel and were never disappointed. The restaurant in the hotel was also very good and there was also a light menu available all day. The staff in the dining rooms were extremely efficient and very friendly.

We cannot say enough about all of the wonderful aspects of the Hotel Napoleon and would urge all travelers to Rome to stay here as you will definitely not be disappointed.

I've seen other reviewers express concern about the neighborhood near the Termini, but we walked there numerous times and never felt insecure. Sure, there's graffiti and some homeless people, but you'll find that all over a City of this size. The Hotel's courtesy airport pickup was a nice treat upon our arrival (a bonus for stays of 3 nights or more). But returning to the airport via the express train from the Termini was also quite easy -- buy your train ticket at the self-service machines in the Termini, for 11 Euros each. Our room was immaculately clean, and the bathroom was much larger than I'd expected, with a big tub/shower and a built-in hair dryer. There was plenty of closet space, cozy radiator heat (including a separate unit in the bathroom), extra blankets, and an in-room safe -- as well as a mini-bar and TV that we never used. Given the orientation of the building, we never heard any street noise from our room. We did frequently hear late-night, \"through the wall\" conversations from inconsiderate neighbors, but it was never bad enough to cause me to lodge a complaint. The breakfast buffet was terrific, with a big variety of food items (pastries, yogurt, cereals, fruit, toast, eggs, etc) along with juices, coffee, tea, and milk. We'd fill up every morning and often didn't really need lunch.

We had a beautiful, clean and spacious room on the second floor, which suited our needs perfectly. The ambience and decor of the lounge area, which contains some beautiful antiques, all added to another restful enjoyable stay. Some people seem not to like the location of the hotel, but we find absolutely no problem whatsoever. Certainly it is a cosmopolitan area, but that all adds to the enjoyment. We freely wandered around at night, without feeling threatened in any way. The metro station is right outside, and the termini a 5 to 10minute stroll away. Sights such as the Colosseum, San Giovanni In Laterano and San Clemente are all short walks away. The service at the hotel just gets better and better, and friendly, knowledgeable staff are always on hand to help with any query, however large or small. It is probably not fair to single out staff, but Franco, Peter, Domenico, Piero and Kabir all deserve special mention, and if they can't help you Mr Cioce the owner is always willing to give advice.

The hotel was in a very very shady part of town, and walking back at night was not easy at all - not fun if you have a pretty young wife with you with unsavory characters staring at the both of you (had one arm around my wife and the other one on my wallet). It was not convenient to metro or bus (about a 4 block walk to the nearest bus stop). You could walk to the Coliseum from it, that was one good thing about it. The lobby was cramped, you had a sitting area one floor up, large and nice ballroom style, nice place to sit and have breakfast, computer there with internet use. Something that i didnt like was you had to walk up one flight of steps to catch the elevator to your room (you could take the elevator up one flight and then walk across the ballroom for the other one as well, took forever). This was my least favorite hotel out of the 6 that we stayed at in Paris and Italy during our honeymoon. Further explanation: On our 15 day honeymoon, 3 days in Paris, 12 days in Italy, I booked our honeymoon through Virgin Vacations, they included 3 nights in a Rome Hotel, I chose Napoleon, luckily it was full and they put us in Hotel Columbus on the other side of town which we adored. At the end of my trip, I had to book a few days on my own, the girl at Virgin who booked my vacation, raved about Napoleon, saying she had been there herself, I went ahead and booked it at Expedia, paying like $230 a night, I could have stayed at other places that were cheaper but I felt like it was a safe bet since Virgin listed this as a superior hotel and the girl on the phone really raved about it. I wouldn't stay here again because of the area, and the general crappiness of the hotel. If its just a bunch of guys with you, and you get a FANTASTIC deal, stay here, otherwise DON'T DO IT!!! 2 stars on their best day, there was no 1.5 star.", "Date": "August 25, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ascot", "Title": "\u201cShocking!\u201d", "Author": "Cloodia", "ReviewID": "UR5496051", "Content": "I have to apologise in advance for this review. When we drove from the airport I had high expectations of this hotel and I was very excited. We pulled up outside this, well, I would describe it as cheap looking, area with lots of entrances to various shops.

I glanced out of the window and saw a hotel across from us. \"Thank goodness we aren't going to be staying there,\" I thought, \"It looks like a really bad hotel.\" Imagine my shock when our luggage was brought into that, \"really bad hotel\". The main reception area wasn't big at all and it didn't look very clean. The lounge area above was, strangely enough, nicely decorated and it had a computer. It was then that I thought the hotel wouldn't be so bad. And then I saw our room. We had booked a junior suite. Yes, a junior suite. There was barely enough space to move in the room and the bathroom was miniscule. The room decoration was dark and depressing and there wasn't even any room service. I was very upset. Our curious family had a look at the fire escape plan on the wall to see how our room compared to all the other rooms. Our junior suite was in fact the biggest in the corridor, meaning I couldn't even begin to fathom how incredibly claustrophobic the other normal rooms would have been. The breakfast was not fantastic and the only really good thing I found about this hotel was that it was near all the good sites to see.
