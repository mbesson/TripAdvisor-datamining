Very good hospitality. Helpful staff. Acceptable hardware. I had very good staying experience with most of the Far East series hotels in Singapore. They had very well manners, helpful and friendly staffs. I will be focused on Elizabeth hotel in this comment. The goods : 1. Convenient. Near to Elizabeth Hospital. Near to Paragon and one street away from Orchard Road. 2. Peaceful environment in the busiest district. 3. Staffs. 4. Hotel room are fine. Get the Deluxe or renovated. Well maintained. 5. Singapore public transport including taxi is very convenient. The to be noted : 1. Standard room hygene. Dusty wardrobe.Not suggest standard room. 2. Pool size is small and just nice to chill. 3. More of a traditional classy 4 star hotel, for fancy choice, the Quincy could be consider. 4. Price. Somehow become more pricey then before. 15% - 30% increased in rate. Visiting their website sometimes got promotion, most time stick with agoda is a better option. Who should consider staying here. 1. For medical purpose traveller. Near to Hospital. Newer room then york. 2. Business traveller. It may be one of the price friend choice in that area, and with a peaceful restaurant+restaurant for some private talks. Things not satisfied. For the previous stay, I had booked a family suite room for One single bed, one king bed, with spacious room size and sofa included. My mom asking for another bed, they shift us to a tiny standard room with dusty wardrobe and an extra bed. For the price I paid, actually it should be noticeable cheaper under that option. This is not a proper arrangement They should offer us a Deluxe Twin room with an extra bed, or just shift out the king size bed and move in two single beds, which is a more proper arrangement. I respond to the front desk, things are discussed in a good manners communications. and they mentioned will take this noted under my name, and sort out better arrangement options for our next stay.

I used to stay here a lot, but that was years ago before the days of Internet Bookings and I depended on the rates quoted at the airport hotel desk. It was indeed pleasant to have returned. I choose a hotel on 3 main things. 1) Free internet as hotels charge exorbitant rates for something that should be free. 2) Value for money and 3) Location. I was pleasantly surprised to have all 3 at the Elizabeth. (Although it would appear that some people on different rates ARE in fact charged extra for internet) They were very full on the weekend I checked in and I was fortunate to be upgraded to a room on their executive floor. The bed was extremely comfortable and the thread count on their sheets was impressively high, as was the quality of the cotton. Towels etc were equally good. I dont use the mini-bar other than to store beers I buy from the local store, and therefore found their lack of beer in the mini-bar fitted in with my needs. However, there were lots of noodle type instant soups provided and a constant request to inquire whether they needed replenishing. The shower was great, good pressure, lots of hot water and very invigorating with all the usual amenities, more than I would ever use. The in-room TV was a huge flat screen and has adequate channels to satisfy most travelers. Very important to me was the nice sized work-desk along with comfortable chair allowing me to spend a lot of time working in comfort. I was also pleasantly surprised to enjoy half priced drinks from 5 to 9 pm every day at all the public areas of the hotel. This makes a daily poolside trip almost compulsory! The complimentary breakfast was wholesome and most desires can be fulfilled at their buffet. I found the hotel to be in a continual state of upgrade and I guess this would explain their rather funky pub with no bar? One would expect to find a pub with a bar, but this one has to get its drinks from what appears to be the \"old\" bar which is situated in the dining room. It is an extremely unfriendly bar, as its bar counter is filled with dining room stuff like hot water urns. The bar counter has a nice foot rail, but not a single bar stool, so one gets the feeling that no one has paid any attention to the ambiance factor inside the public areas, and most people get the ambiance factor around the pool. However, whilst the half priced happy hours may attract a few folks like me, there is nothing more social about a busy little pub when one is travelling solo on business and it is usually nice to find like minded travelers with which to pass the time and enjoy a few drinks. Maybe this will change in the future upgrade plans. I do really enjoy the close proximity to the hustle and bustle of Orchard Rd/Scotts Rd and the location of this hotel is excellent if one is a shopper! I've tried to be as balanced as possible with this report and would end with the thought that given the same pricing, I would definitely choose this hotel again.", "Date": "January 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Australia", "Title": "\u201cTired d\u00e9cor, but its proximity to Orchard Road makes it good value for money\u201d", "Author": "Rambutaan", "ReviewID": "UR123195224", "Content": "I suspect the main reason people stay at the Elizabeth is that it\u2019s accommodation near Singapore\u2019s shopping precinct of Orchard Road, without the Orchard Road Hotel prices.

Air conditioning, lighting and the hand basin taps all worked fine although we had issues when it came to showering as the temperature oscillated between scalding hot and freezing cold.

Other hotel staff were helpful in carrying bags to our rooms and we even managed to get an emergency roll of toilet paper late one night!

One time they placed free toblerones beside the lamp, very nice turn down service. :D Very good! Although price was very expensive since we stayed during the F1 weekend. Suggestion: Try eating from the Food Republic! you get all sorts of inexpensive cuisine! Try home made Iced Lemon Tea from hawkers. Wee Nam Kee snacks were yum. Chinese food: the best is DIN TAI FUNG!!! delicious Xiao Long Bao! And of course, the stars of Singaporean cuisine: Chilli crabs (best is Long Island, near airport), and Cereal Praws (best is No signboard, by marina bay) \u90e8\u5c4b\u306f\u5feb\u9069\u3067\u3057\u305f\u3002\u30d9\u30c3\u30c9\u3082\u3088\u304b\u3063\u305f\u3057\u3001\u30d0\u30b9\u30eb\u30fc\u30e0\u3082\u5e83\u304b\u3063\u305f\u3057\uff01\u30db\u30c6\u30eb\u306e\u4f4d\u7f6e\u306forchard\u9053\u306b\u3042\u308b\u3068\u601d\u3044\u307e\u3059\u304c\u3001\u8cb7\u3044\u7269\u306b\u30d9\u30b9\u30c8\u30ed\u30b1\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u3067\u3059\uff01\u591c\u304a\u98a8\u5442\u306b\u5165\u308b\u306e\u306f\u6700\u9ad8\u3067\u3057\u305f\u3002 \u304a\u3059\u3059\u3081\uff1a \u30db\u30fc\u30ab\u30fc \uff08\u5c0f\u3055\u3044\u304a\u5e97\uff09\u306e home made lemon iced tea \u306f\u304a\u3044\u3057\u304b\u3063\u305f! \u65e5\u672c\u6599\u7406\u306f\u307e\u3042\u307e\u3042\u3067\u3057\u305f\u304c\u3001\u30a4\u30f3\u30c9\u6599\u7406\u3001\u4e2d\u83ef\u3001\u30d5\u30a3\u30ea\u30d4\u30f3\u3001\u30bf\u30a4\u3001\u30a4\u30f3\u30c9\u30cd\u30b7\u30a2\u6599\u7406\u3092\u5168\u90e8\u8a66\u3057\u305f\u306e\u3067\u3046\u308c\u3057\u3044\u3067\u3059\uff01 \u4e2d\u83ef\u6599\u7406\u306a\u3093\u3067\u3059\u304c\u3001No Signboard \u306echili crabs \u3068 cereal prawns \u306f\u3059\u3054\u304f\u304a\u3044\u3057\u304b\u3063\u305f\uff01chili \u306f\u3082\u3061\u308d\u3093\u5165\u3063\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3093\u3067\u3059\u304c\u3001\u305d\u3093\u306a\u306b\u8f9b\u304f\u306a\u3044\u3068\u601d\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002 Universal Studios \u306a\u3089\u3001USJ \u306e\u307b\u3046\u304c\u305c\u3093\u305c\u3093\u5927\u304d\u3044\u3067\u3059\uff01\u3067\u3059\u3051\u308c\u3069\u3082\u3001\u305c\u3072USS\u3092\u304a\u697d\u3057\u307f\u304f\u3060\u3055\u3044\uff01", "Date": "October 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cVery friendly and helpful staff and service.\u201d", "Author": "Mike999a", "ReviewID": "UR118684509", "Content": "Overall review rates this hotel 3star class with 4 star services.

Not so good: My room was at the rear of the elevator shaft so the mechanical noise of metal against metal occurred all night long and was very unsettling. The room was small and my one suitcase could barely fit which made walking around the room uncomfortable. I couldn't get my wi-fi going so two different staff members came at separate times to assist. Neither could get it going so both staff members came up with the solution of calling for telephone tech support. Unfortunately the telephone was by the bed and nowhere near the desk where the computer was plugged in so support was only possible via mobile phone. Despite two hours taken out of my one day in Singapore, I had to accept the fact that wi-fi was not going to work at the Elizabeth Hotel in Singapore! And this despite the fact that I'd had no problem with wi-fi in Delhi, where it had been fully functioning for the week prior! I ordered bircher muesli from the room service breakfast menu and received muesli instead. When I called to advise the mistake, the staff didn't seem to understand that there was a difference, and the restaurant manager whom I was put through to, said that bircher muesli had not been available for a long time and expressed his annoyance that it still remained on the room service menu. No-one apologized or offered any alternative. Coffee ordered via room service was so bitter it was undrinkable and came already poured into a single small cup so that it was no longer hot when it arrived. No pot of coffee was provided, only this small cup of luke warm bitter coffee. When I advised that the ironing board could not be adjusted into a standing position, little attention was paid to me and I had to call again to request that someone come and either fix it or replace it. It had to be replaced because housekeeping also found it to be faulty. Again, no apology and their lack of immediate attention caused me to be late. The replacement ironing board was so low in it's upright position, ironing had to be done from seated position, and the iron was dirty and marked my white linen skirt.

We had no choice to choose Elizabeth because Singapore was busy for the Food Festival. I was charged for no show and extension of one night would cost 700SGD for a deluxe room, post Ash cloud. Rate on average was 180SGD-380SGD increasing by the day, no internet, no breakfast, very poor value for money. Concierge that did not care. Reservation staff that are not courteous and have an attitude problem, general manager or senior reservation staff that turn a blind eye when irate and dissatisfied guests expressing concern or complaint. Not sure of star rating, but not even a 4 star in my standard and not worth the money during high season. If you are paying high room rates, add 100SGD and upgrade to the Royal Suite, a world of difference, comfy big bed, spacious room and bathroom, except plentiful of ants! Breakfast is not worth paying the price, go outside and we did not even know that the Suite could get you into a private F&B area for proper coffee and beverages.

Each time has been very pleasant and trouble-free, and this was no exception. The hotel is a relatively modern facility of 12-15 stories or so, with a small restaurant and bar on the main floor. As near as I can tell, it does not have a business center nor any meeting rooms; it's purely a hotel. The location is superior. It's a five-minute walk down the hill to the Paragon Shopping Center and Orchard Road, which really is the heart of commercial Singapore. The shopping, people-watching and the dining options are unmatched. I recommend ANY of the restaurants across Orchard Road in Tagashimaya (sp?) Plaza on the 4th floor, and \"Emerald Row\" three blocks to the left is a string of old buildings that have been reclaimed into excellent, affordable, semi-outdoor restaurants with a fun nightlife. My client found it easy to get to the Elizabeth and pick me up; and the taxi to and from the airport is a brisk 20 minutes or so (usually, the P.I.E. to C.T.E., or the alternative route using the E.C.P.; I've had taxis take both routes and it's almost always S$20). The facility is fine, but not glamorous. The breakfast buffet never changes (a big negative in my mind). The rooms are a bit small and the bathrooms even smaller. But every room has a desk, CNN on the flat screen TV; the rooms are clean, everything works like a champ, and the staff work hard to be friendly and inviting. So for the US$150 or so a night, you get a clean, safe, modern facility right in the heart of Singapore, three blocks from the Marriott and the Hilton and probably 1/3rd the price. Personally, I think it's a great value. A special kudo to the fellow working the bar -- he's there every night it seems. I was sitting by the pool enjoying a smoke and a scotch about 11pm, and an Australian lady walked in who had just landed after a much-delayed flight from Shanghai. Even though the kitchen was closed, this fellow went back to the kitchen, rousted them out and made her a bit of dinner. It wasn't fancy, but they really went out of their way to help her. Thats the kind of service that really means something to me -- because everybody gets delayed flights, and these folk really helped. Another little success story -- I needed a 5am wake-up call one morning, and I had mentioned to the desk clerk I could not be late for this pick-up. Not only did they call me, they called me again 15 mins later to make sure I had not fallen back to sleep. Again, it's a little thing, but an important sense of caring. BTW -- the Elizabeth has a sister hotel, the Quincy, right next to it; much more modern, hip and stylish. I've never stayed there, but I've heard no complaints, so I suspect it's a good choice too. Overall, this is not the place to stay for a resort visit with beaches and plam trees. But if you're on business in Singapore, it's a far better value than Traders, Excelsior or Fairmont, and I've stayed at all of them and others besides.

One problem we did have was we wanted to use our laptop and use the hotels Wifi connection which you had to connect with the jackpoint in the room so it could be charged to your bill. Each room supposedly is provided with a lead for this purpose - ours was in the desk drawer. It was about 2 feet too short - trying to explain this to the technical staff was a nightmare - when someone eventually came to the room he said 'Oh, we will need a longer connection'!!!!!!!!!!! Surely they must have checked it/we can't have been the first ones to use it? Anyhow a minor issue but something to be aware of.

I guess we forgot one detail; that The Elizabeth was on MOUNT ELIZABETH, which doesn't sound very encouraging at all now that I think about it. Yeap you get the drift, the hotel is basically at the top of this hill which looked short on plan. It took about 10 minutes in the HEAT to walk into the Paragon Shopping Mall, and climbing up the hill 2 times a day was seriously a stress test for the heart. Orchard Road wasn't that great for shopping anyways (things weren't good value, construction everywhere, dusty, etc) so the only redeeming factor it would have is if it was close to an MRT station. The Orchard MRT station was a good 25-30 minute walk from the hotel, so please be prepared for this if you want to stay here. Cabs however will be easy to take as on the way down the hill, there are these medical centres with taxi stops. Yup there's construction going on right beside the building, but I wasn't bothered by it too much. I don't spend an awful lot of time staring out my hotel window. =P The complimentary breakfast was a downer. Even the omelette tasted WEIRD like thin plastic discs. I don't know what went wrong there. We asked for coffee TWICE, only to be served TEA. We said explicitly 'COF- FEE' again but the waiters came back after 2 minutes confirming if we wanted tea? *pulls hair* The orange and fruit juices were from cordial concentrates, but I won't complain too much as breakfast was complimentary with the room. All in all, rooms are clean and the room was gorgeous (newly refurbished I think, everything was quite new). The bed was good! And we got papers every morning. A perfectly functioning TV too with satellite TV reception. However, on the down side, the staffs are generally clueless and don't seem very experienced.

My booking said the room would contain one double bed and one single bed, yet when I checked in, it contained two single beds only. When I queried this, the manager said he would swap one of the single beds for a double bed. The trouble with this was that the room was so small that the only way of fitting in a single and double bed would be to remove the desk, which was a standard feature of the room. In other words, the room was too small to realistically contain a single and double bed. The location is not as bad as claimed in some of the reviews.

We were similarly disappointed when we ordered room service - our order was delivered 20 mins late, we didn't receive what we'd asked for, the portions were small and the food flavours were over-powering (garlic dressing on caesar salad). The hotel is in need of rennovation. For example the painted finish of the baths in both rooms were flaking to a significant extent and the over-bath shower heads were immovable and sprayed water all over the edge of the bath and the toilet when turned on. We decided to check out after three nights of a planned four night stay, and my partner rang reception to check whether there would be any penalty charges for leaving a day early. He was told that there would not be any charges, so we packed and went downstairs an hour later to check out. We were then told by staff that we would incur the full charge for our fourth night. We challenged this and spoke to John Yap, the hotel's Guest Service Manager. He listened to our comments and after some initial reluctance agreed to advise Expedia that the hotel would not be requesting payment for the fourth night and would ask them to refund us the charge (it had been prepaid at time of booking).
