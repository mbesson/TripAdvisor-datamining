The only drawbacks I could mention - was poor English of the man on reception and payed WIFI (I bought 1 hour, used 5 minutes, When I tried to use the rest in the evening - the bought account was already invalid - but obviously that is their system).

We did however know this before so we used a backpack as many of Rome's attractions have steps and is not a great place for suitcases. Had to ask for directions to find hotel as was not sure: Catch Metro Line B to Laurentina and get the 044 bus for about 25mins (its not the distance that makes up this time its the caotic traffic that is constantly surrounding Rome! Get off the bus just after it has passed the hotel, the bus stop is just before a petrol station. Once you have done this journey for the first time you realise it is not at all difficult, only fault is that the bus does not run that often, so in the morning you can be waiting up to 30mins for the bus. Arriving at the hotel we were greeted by a man at reception who checked us in and was very polite. Due to the hotel be out of the centre of Rome there is absolutely no noise that reaches your rooms. Also there is a car park space in front of every room. We thought the quality of the room was great, I have read some reviews that it is not clean, but I did not see any trace of dirt during our stay! Our room was cleaned and tidied everyday, and we were very impressed with the level of service. Breakfast was served in a room downstairs, it was a bright and airy room, as mentioned by a previous reviewer there are no windows but there is some nice artwork on the walls, the staff are friendly and there was plently of table to choose from. Breakfast is a buffet styled affair, with lots of choice, very impressed. I would advice to take some fruit from the breakfast table as there is not an opportunity for much fruit during the day. There is no where to really eat nearby the hotel in terms of dinner, we just had an early lunch and an early dinner in the city of Rome, but you do tend to be hungry by breakfast! We were very impressed with the black our curtains in our room, what with the curtains and noiseless surroundings we were getting 10 hours sleep! There is nothing really to do around the hotel, so I would advice stay out as late as possible, have dinner and then get a great nights sleep! Overall we have a great experience at the hotel, I would recommend it to everyone except those who want a busy nightlife, unless you get a cab but i imagine that would be expensive over the period of your stay. One final tip would be dont rush in to purchasing a ROMA Pass (we did as soon as we got to the airport) because you might want a guided tour around the sites and your pass covers none of that as those are all ran by individual tour groups, so you have to pay for a ticket and tour and you dont ge to use your ROMA pass on that visit. I hope this review has helped some people! :-)", "Date": "May 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cSOME REVIEWS ARE FAKE PERHAPS...HERE`S THE TRUTH\u201d", "Author": "fussycat_in_the_silk", "ReviewID": "UR81975997", "Content": "in a few words i would say: STYLISH BUT NEGLECTED, CLEANLINESS TO BE IMPROVED BY LONG WAY, though not unbeareable. It all starts in a nice but very uncommon manner: there is no website (at the time of writing at least) and no way to find a telephone number of the structure unless you buy a booking by expedia, venere, booking.com etc. Once the booking is done they give you a phone number. The whole thing is out of the world, so if you have an affair or madly in love with someone it is a good place to spend hours isolated in the middle of nowhere, not even a person of the staff will notice apart from the guy at check in, and you could even hide a body in your car boot and make it in pieces in your bedroom and not be seen.Being a solo woman I was a bit intimidated by the motel look but fortunately there were only nice couples of young people or tourists, no dodgy characters despite being so isolated, don`t get me wrong, I felt safe, its gates have security staff 24 hours a day which do not allow anyone in apart from the guests. getting there is a long way from town as other reviewers have said. I had a car and the whole of my business day was around Eur, a business side of Rome, a bit end of town, so quite convenient for me. The hotel is really stylish, as other have said, you get into a gate and check in from your car, then you drive onto a grass boulevard and get to your room, park in front of the mini bungalow itself, motel-like, where deep and high meadows divide your space and your privacy from the other rooms. You can push a botton and a stylish white curtain keeps you away from anything. As you get into the room, it` s stylish, modern, beautiful, but first impression it is quite neglected, very near to dirty, there were several oily fingerprints on the stylish alluminum fridge bar, and also a few giant size mosquitos all over the place. I went to kill two of them with a booklet and found on the booklet itself a few dead ones with their line of blood...someone had made the same use of it. There is a fridge full of industrial ready made frozen dinners and even ice creams,that you can heat on by microwave, and a stylish coffee machine, which you have to pay for, though advertised on expedia that coffee facility is free. Again very good if you mean to spend a long time in your room with your loved one and keep away from sight. The bathroom is nice but again not immaculately clean, the shower cabin is very stylish but there are basically no toiletries, except for a metal dispenser in the shower and a similar one on the basin. The whole room had been cleaned in no more than 10 minutes including making the bed, which looked like the sheets had been thrown on it very quickly, therefore did not fit properly on the mattrass. The worst to me was that being basically a countryside place there are a few insects, some killed by previous guests, and many of their corpses and blood stains were decorating the wall, which gave it a \"dirty\" look to it. I asked if they could change the room and they said they were fully booked which was not true being late in the evening and all the rooms on one side had no cars in front of them. They accepted to clean it though, as I went out for dinner, which they made sufficiently. The only place in this deserted part of outer Rome was 10 minutes drive and it was a basic Restaurant called merlo parlante, they cook in an acceptable way, are very nice, but nothing special. If you don`t drive no way to get there, though, and also need a sat navigator, being quite hidden as well. My night sleep was quite comfortable, silence ll over though very near the road, excellent air con, mattras hard enough, good pillows, but again the feeling of dust on the bed cover. Perhaps this room had not been used for a while? Tv was great , LCD, big size, lots of channels, etc. Breakfast very rich though the room quite cold and impersonal, you step down in a sort of bunker, with no windows..again, very good to hide from the world outside, as you hardly see someone of the staff during the whole stay. The canteen staff were very polite, smiley and attentive and made a fantastic cappuccino for me. As you get out, same as checking in, from your car. the staff was not very attentive at reception at way out, though,and even if there was a note in the room, saying that it was suggested to check out on the phone prior to leaving the room saying if anything had been used in the fridge, in order not to form a queue of cars at check out, I had to wait a few minutes for the receptionists which were talking to each other and leaving me there with my engine on for nearly ten minutes, very unprofessional. My conclusion: stylish, good for a love escape if your standard of cleanliness is not high ..and if you don`t mind driving out of town to get there and have your meals elsewhere as there is nothing or nearly around. (unless you heat up frozen food from the fridge) I certainly would get back if they cleaned it a bit better and redecorated the wall stained by dead insects, as it is very modern, stylish, unusual, silent, and above all , very well priced. What a shame... it`s a beautiful place and I liked this sensation of privacy though far from anything.", "Date": "October 3, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rome, Italy", "Title": "\u201cVery good deal! Only downside is location.\u201d", "Author": "ZeddicusRome", "ReviewID": "UR79775786", "Content": "I live in Rome but because of renovation works in my house I needed to find a comfortable spot to spend few days. Location: i think is the only downside. it's just out of city boundary in a pretty isolated area (it seems to be more in countryside than in a big city) , few kms from closest underground station (Laurentina): there's a bus stop nearby , but because of traffic it may take a bit to reach the underground station. So, ok if you have a car, otherwise be prepared to spend quite a lot of time travelling to reach major turistic spots. On the opposite the place is really calm with no noise at all: wonderful place for a good sleep or just relaxing. Hotel main building and services: actually it's a motel. all rooms are on ground floor with private parking in front. It's a small hotel: there are i think not more than 20-30 rooms. Apart from a reception and a breakfast room there are no other common spaces. Breakfast is included in rate: decent but nothing exceptiona, be prepared for a quite basic continental breakfast. The breakfast room is in the basement (no windows) with no decoration so it may appear a bit \"cold\" and unpersonal. Hotel staff are very helpfull and very kind. Rooms: very clean, decent sized (for european standards, maybe a bit small for US travellers), well equipped (air condition, big LCD flat screen, dvd player, satellite TV, espresso coffee machine, hairdryer, shower gel and soap in wall mounted dispenser). Nice touch: all lights are controlled remotely through small panels in wall and near bed. the glass shower box in the middle of the room can be controversial: if you are travelling with your partner is a nice feature otherwise... Overall: clean, modern, nice designed rooms, good priced for a 3 star hotel (below 100euros per night, which is not easy to find in Rome). I would suggest this hotel to couples and small families given location is not their main requirement.", "Date": "September 16, 2010"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "All Seasons Garden Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187791-d794520-Reviews-All_Seasons_Garden_Hotel-Rome_Lazio.html", "Price": "$78 - $171*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Via Castel Di Leva 108</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">00134</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Rome</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Italy</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "794520", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/f6/b9/f6b99369ebf5839b22ab0bbde4b3a2995large.jpg"}}
