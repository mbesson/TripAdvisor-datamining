It's the first time I have been in an extended stay type of property. It is apartment like, you get a kitchen, living room, small bath and two desks, you get free fully cooked breakfast buffet in the morning and a simple dinner, wine, drinks Tuesday through Thursday. This helps cut costs for families traveling with children and after traveling for six weeks, mine were happy to see something that looked like an apartment. Free internet in the business center, free coffee/tea all day, free laundry and no parking fees really cut down the cost of traveling, particularly with children. BEWARE, although pet friendly, be warned, they charge $75 for three nights and $150 for six nights (almost three times the cost of the hotel rental if you got a deal on Priceline). Nowhere at the front desk does it say that there is a fee, particularly one that increases after three days to $150. When I was automatically charged this on check-out, I was assumed to know this. Day clerks are really nice, night staff is a bit grumpy, particularly Roy. This is east Chatsworth, not a gorgeous area, but near the mountains with a nice nightly breeze. It's worth it if you can get a deal bidding on a room through one of the sites, expensive if you pay their going rate of $160-170 a night. A nice alternative to a hotel though and with a separate living room/kitchen (with pullout couch) and double doors to the bedroom, it's a good place to share with someone. My kids loved it. Maintenance people are spyish. Oh, if using Netspend or debit cards, beware. Every couple of days a $50 charge is put through for your incidentals. With Netspend, It takes 20 days to get your incidental charges reversed you don't request that they fax a release to your debit card company, bank debit cards have their own policies. Bottom line, if you can get this room through priceline (the only 3 star hotel in their area other than the Radisson which is also an extended stay type) for $75-80, it's a pretty good deal.

It was pretty far away from where we had hoped to be staying, but since it was a weekend traffic on the freeways was not a huge issue. We checked into the hotel pretty late about 8pm on a Friday evening. The lobby was very quiet, I could hear music playing but no one greeted me at the at the front. Finally a woman came up and her name was Ria. Ria was so rude and so unfriendly. I told her I was with my family and we had a four year old. She told me I needed to sign this paper which was basically saying that if we were given any warning for noise we'd be asked to leave, there is NO warning and we'd be charged instantly for $300! My concern is that I have a 4 yr old and he could possibly make too much noise or jump up and down and I wouldn't be warned? Of course I'm going to try my hardest to keep him quiet but she was so rude about it. She had little to no personality and if she is the 1st person I'm going to be greeted by Staybridge needs to rethink their personnel! I have no other complaints about the hotel; room was very nice, bathroom was very clean, beds were comfortable and we had Free Wifi. My only complaint about the room is that in the living room area, the curtains don't close only the blinds close and the top blind was missing or broken so the light from outside was shining into the room all night! I would for sure recommend this hotel, I'm just hoping Ria can learn to treat people better.

The Superviser advised me that there would be a $50 hold on my credit card for incidentals. Pretty standard. I informed her that I may be extending my stay one more night.

In the two previous visits I was pleased with their basic and reliable amenities of an extended stay. This time I received the worst treatment as a hotel guest I have ever experienced. Basically my family and I were suddenly shortchanged in our stay in order to accomodate some other hotel guest of \"higher priority\" for the management. I guess they just hoped that I wouldn't notice or that I wouldn't care that one day into the reservation the level of comfort of our stay had drastically diminished. What followed was a series of sixteen lies (yes, I counted) by the two managers at the front desk in order to cover up what they had done. Eventurally, the operations manager apologized profusedly and gave me points on my frequent stay card and 20% off on our NEXT stay (which we will not be using). This was not the way to get me to come back, but may be that was the point. By the end, it was pointed out to me how much the front desk managers felt they had gone out of their way in order to make things right AFTER I pointed out that they had lied repeatedly and made our pre-Christmas day miserable. The entire management staff needs some serious training on accountability, customer relations, and communication among staff.", "Date": "December 28, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Philadelphia", "Title": "\u201cLoved it!\u201d", "Author": "spach", "ReviewID": "UR5626746", "Content": "I loved the Staybridge suites at Chatsworth, definitely worth the money.
