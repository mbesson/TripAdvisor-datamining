There's an A-C-E Metro stop right outside, so taking the Metro from Penn Station after our Acela ride was a piece of cake. My husband accompanied me and the room was a decent size for a mid priced Manhattan hotel. Plenty of room for two people. It was clean and the bed and bedding werwe comfortable. We had some problems with the heat/AC unit so the temp was a bit hard to control, but it wasn't a huge issue. The room phone in the bedroom did not work, but the one in the bathroom did. This was only a slight problem when I had to go to the front desk to request a late checkout (which the front desk immediately obliged with no difficulty) vs. calling down there. When my husband opened the curtain to look out the window, he was a bit shocked, never having seen the WTC site up close. A bit disturbing at first to think about what happened right outside the door, we had a bird's eye view of the beehive of activity down there as they work to re-create the area. Construction noise was not a problem at all. Despite the small issues, this was a great place to stay, and getting around was extremely easy.

I have stayed at 3 in 3 different states. However, I do travel extensively and would consider myself somewhat experienced when it comes to hotels. The reasons I can't give the Millenium Hilton higher marks are as follows: Front Desk Staff: This was the one highlight I had. The staff at the front desk and the supporting staff were great. Very friendly and they had my requests on record and happily fulfilled them. Pool and Gym: a rare find in this city, the pool and gym are great by all standards. If this is important then you can't go with this hotel. Rooms: The room was clean but felt \"dark\". You can't expect any hotel to have rooms of any great size so I wouldn't take points off for that. Concierge Lounge: as a frequent traveler, I depend greatly on the concierge lounge. This hotel doesn't have one! To me this is a huge deal breaker. Restaurants: The restaurant was good. The staff is very friendly and helpful. However, the \"bar\" is right by the elevators. I was traveling with my family and I didn't really care for the atmosphere for my kids. Location: Great. I can't say much about that. Overall: If I was traveling alone I may have given it an extra point but I was with my family. I did not want to stay there with my kids. Hilton hotels and staff are great but the layout of the entrance didn't make it very kid friendly.

We did not stay in the hotel very much but enjoyed the time we were there. The hotel is in a great location. We drove to a parking deck in NJ near the PATH train and took the train in from there. I say this because if you are a Jersey person the train station at Harrison on the PATH line has a great safe parking deck that will cost you $11 for 12 hour instead of the $60 the hotel charges. The hotel is a quick walk from the PATH station and a ton of subway lines. We saw a play had dinner, hung out at a few bars in the village and had a wonderful bed a few minutes away in the Hilton. The view was amazing. We were right above the eastern edge of the World Trade Center site. I was worried that there would be noise from construction but there was nothing but that great view of the site, memorial and NYC skyline. We stayed on a Saturday in mid march, reserved on the Hilton website and paid a $189 AAA rate. With tax it came to about 220. The room was pretty small but the bed was so very comfortable.

During the day the area is vibrant, alive and bustling with energy, in the evening, it was peaceful and quiet, which after reading other reviewers comments, I was surprised to find. We could not hear any construction noises in either the suite or the regular room that we booked. Another reason for my booking was the indoor pool which was a delight for my children, as well as the close proximity to the 9/11 memorial, which we visited. But back to the pool. It was a delight. My children and their friend got a kick out of being able to swim in NYC while also being able to view the city buildings and the pool was a perfect temperature. The gentleman they had on hand was courteous, always with a smile and very helpful but never intruding, which I appreciated. I was traveling with another adult who had been one of the firefighters during 9/11 on the scene and I was worried that it might be too much for him to take in, while this was his first visit back to the site since 9/11 but he too found the surroundings of the hotel to be serene and peaceful. The location is perfect if you are also wanting to have quick access to uptown, as the R train is only steps outside of the main entrance. The hotel staff was friendly, and while you knew they were there to help, they were never overly in your face, which I truly appreciated for this trip.

We decided that rather than head out to dinner, we'd opt for room service, returned to our room, and ordered. We were told that contrary to the menu in the room and the menu on the TV, every single item we requested (2 meals, 2 appetizers, and a bottle of wine) were not available. We were told that only a very limited menu was available after 11:00, again contrary to the menu and front desk. We ordered a few mediocre items from the very limited list we were verbally offered; we were charged over $90 for what should have cost $40 or so. We called to complain to the night manager, who did return the call but offered no apology or explanation, except to say that there is NOT a limited menu after 11:00--contrary to what we had just been told by her staff.

We had dinner very close by the hotel, which was a bit expensive but very good. You can find everything that you need right around the corner. In overal, we both had an amazing weekend in New York City and the price to value ratio for this type of room and location was amazing.

As other reviewers have noted, it oversees Ground Zero and the WTC memorial. But compared to other Hilton properties in NYC, including less expensive brands, it is only average. Virtually all of my travel is for work, so I don't worry too much about room rates, or other sundry expenses associated with my travel. However, Hilton has always found it is sound business policy to charge for internet access at its more expensive properties. I've never quite understood it, and this hotel is no exception. While the cost for access is a pittance compared to the room rate, it is what I consider to be nickel and diming the business traveler. I do have a choice of hotels when I travel so little things like this wind up influencing my decision as to where to stay. For my part, I did ask to have the internet connection fee waived, but the manager said no. That seems like a pennywise and pound-foolish decision, but that's life. I'm quite certain that Hilton does not care about an individual traveler's view, rather it is concerned about views of all travelers at the macro level. I do have three more trips booked in March and none are at Hilton properties, but that is merely coincidence.

Fabulous at night as the site is eluminated, never draw the curtains. Bathroom also dull and depressing, bath made for midgets too low, naff freebies. The breakfast extremely sparse, lacked imagination and choice, the fruit juices very watery, no flavour. Hot dishes weird choice of small sausages, scambled eggs and disgusting looking over cooked bacon - they had a strange thing of taking hot dishes away for a while. The waiters are old, worn out, not interested and not professional, everything too much trouble, takes ages for coffee/fruit juice to appear.

Bathroom was adequate and toiletries were good. Sheets were good thread count and the bed and pillows were nice. We ate at the in-hotel restaurant Church and Dey (see separate review) - food was adequate for a hotel restaurant but they seem to have strange rules regarding items from the bar. The bar in the lobby is also adequate for a hotel facility- we had the pleasure of meeting Richard the barman- very professional and helpful, he was clearly the best staff member of our visit. Public bathrooms on the ground floor need A LOT of attention- I understand they are in New York, but their condition and odor were really unacceptable, especially in a Hilton Hotel.

The location of the hotel is great and is right next to a subway station, which is excellent news for amateurs like me. I had read reviews that said that the noise from the 9/11 memorial being built next door was intrusive and luckily I had a room on the 29th floor, so this was not an issue for me. The hotel is older and obviously a classic from it's time, but it's looking a little dated now and the rooms are incredibly small - again, this is likely in keeping with most of New York. As with most US establishments, the staff were adequate, but wanted a tip for simply performing their job. I don't mind tipping the guy who lugs your cases up to your room and gives you an overview of the hotel and surroundings, but I do resent the long face when you don't hand over a couple of dollars to the guy who opens the door. However, for the most part, the staff were friendly and polite - especially the Concierge desk. The food was fine and the selection pretty good. Overall I was not unhappy with my stay in New York, but it doesn't really compare in terms of value for other places.

The downtown area of this hotel is a busy hub, with Wall Street, Zucotti Park (occupy Wall Street), and the World Trade Center site steps away. The valet parking which is always pricey in big cities, costs $55 per night. The outside of the hotel is very nice, and quite tall at 55 floors. The lobby is nice and clean, with a friendly staff that says hello when they see you. The is also a gift shop with an ATM, and many other New York related souvenirs. The gift shop also sells snacks and drinks. There is a bar called \"Liquid Assets\" in the lobby, which is not too impressive, consisting of one tv, and not enough seating in my opinion. The hotel also has a fitness center on the 5th floor, and restaurant on the third floor. I did not use either. The hallways are clean, but otherwise pretty standard for a hotel. We had a room on the 10th floor of the hotel. The room was average size, again nothing special. The tv was a 42` Plasma, that was in the wall. The picture on the tv was not great, with several channels being fuzzy. There was an issue with the heat in the room, with the room being very cool when we walked in. We played with the digital thermostat for a while to no avail, and had to call maintenance. The man came quickly to fix it, but we could never feel quite comfortable temperature wise. The rest of the room was fine, a normal bathroom, a stocked mini-bar, and pricey snacks. Our room had a view of the World Trade Center site, which is currently under construction. You can see the newly built 9/11 memorial from the room as well, which is beautiful. As many others have stated, the construction noise is an issue. You can hear hammering in the morning, as well as throughout the day. Construction cranes are visible passing by as well. Being a New Yorker my whole life, it was kind of sad to be so close, and replay the tragic events of that day in my mind. This particular hotel closed for 2 years after 9/11, so its rebuilding and capacity of guests are important, but the noise can be an issue for some. The sound of honking horns and sirens could also be heard, I just wish they soundproofed a bit better. I could also hear guests speaking in the halls. I slept relatively well, soft squishy pillows, big bed. The maid service was great in my room. The total for our room ( 2 nights, 2 guests, no room service) just room, taxes, and parking, was $532. I believe the room was $229 per night. As I stated in the title, the hotel is just ok.

The view of the World Trade Center site was incredible and it was very interesting to watch the construction going on. Did not have any problem with noise...what we did hear was very muffled and not annoying at all. If you are primarily wanting to go see a lot of Broadway shows and do a lot of shopping on Park Avenue, this obviously would not be for you. If you've done that already, and want to explore the south end of Manhattan, this is a fantastic spot. Century 21, the discount clothing store, is right next door, there seemed to be plenty of places to eat close by (take out pizza, Stage Door Deli), and lots of tourist attractions, including the Statue of Liberty Ferry, The Museum of the American Indian (free, quite interesting, and not overwhelming), and some of the churches affected by 9/11 have very poignant exhibits. Also, walk up Broadway from here, and there is GREAT shopping at funky clothing stores as well as some well-known chain clothing stores. AND, I found out that they do not charge tax on clothing (or at least on the $20 worth I bought!). It is about 15-20 minutes by convenient subway to Times Square, so it's not THAT far from Broadway shows, but with each subway ride being about $2.25 each ride, you're looking at $4.50 per roundtrip per person. If you get a Metro Card, and purchase $10.00 worth, you get an extra 7% back on the card to use. There are also Metro Cards for $29 that are good for 7 days, so that would be a better bargain for a longer stay. I think we spent around $20 per person on subways for a three day stay, so not bad.

I've never come across this kind of sensor technology so was quite surprised. Right away we called the reception area and explained we hadn't taken anything out, just handled a couple of bottles. They were very nice about it and said they would wipe the charges off our account right away. So be sure not to play around in the mini bar unless you actually want to consume the products. Food and drink in the hotel is quite expensive so try to venture outside to local cafes and shops. Two bottles of still water were $11! So don't purchase much there.

I know that an accusation of bedbugs is a very serious charge and I would not say this lightly, but I cannot rule it out. These are definitely not mosquito bites...I always have the same reaction to them and this is totally different. The bites are hard red pustules. They have become much more itchy, reddened, and inflamed in the past 2 days. By the time we arrived home I had become extremely worried that we could possibly be bringing bedbugs home with us, so I immediately washed all of our clothing in hot water and even threw away my suitcase because it had been on the floor next to my bed. I am not taking any chances. At the time I did not look for nor did I see any bedbugs, but now I cannot figure out what else could have bitten me during my sleep.

There are pockets of resistance against this new culture of \"the guest, our enemy\" (notably a minority at reception and in the breakfast bar), but overall, I felt the hostility at times was so gross, that I ultimately decided to put up and shut up, in fear that housekeeping would defecate my bathroom or room service would burry maggots in my burger. Ok, I admit, I'm polarising somewhat, but I have no other description for certain obvious deficits in basic customer service. I nearly considered walking through the lobby in my pijamas when I was brusquely told by the operator that there was no one available to deliver an overnight fax to my room at 6 in the morning, and that I would have to get it from the front desk myself. I was told off in no uncertain terms for being responsible for the malfunction of my key card, after it repeatedly failed to open my hotel room door. And the remains of my less than average burger, which someone from room service had kindly volunteered to actually deliver to my room the previous evening, were still spread out on the try outside my room the next morning, filling the corridor air with a welcoming smell of onions and kitchen scraps. These are just a handful of the somewhat more extreme examples.

I was shocked that we were not able to check-in 2.5 hours after check-in time because the hotel had extended the check-out time for other guests. They should know how to manage the timing of arrivals/departures and only grant accomadations accordingly. I asked for an upgrade to an available room but was told that none were available. The staff had no idea how long it would take for a room to become available and we were told that there were other guests in line ahead of us waiting for vacancies. We were offered a complimentary drink in the bar, which I found offputting considering we were carrying luggage and exhausted from our travels. Instead, we headed to their restaurant for a bite which was completely unimpressive and overpriced. The waitstaff appeared disinterested in their jobs and the service suffered immensely. When we finally made it to our room we discovered that we were right on top of Ground Zero. This hotel isn't just near, close to, or have a view of Ground Zero - noooo, it is on top of it!

It is practically impossible to get passes into 911 Memorial right now, there is a limited number of passes and line goes on for ever to get them, but we had a good view of it out of the windows! The room was very comfortable: comfortable mattress, nice linens, coffee maker with two cups that can be brewed at the same time, hairdryer. The room was spacious and well appointed: there was a desk and desk chair with internet access (not free), and a comfortable recliner with ottoman in front of the TV. TV was a 42 inch LCD, I only wish it would swivel to get a better angle of the TV from the bed (but viewing LCD was okay at that angle just not straight on). The location is excellent. There are several subway stations right next to the hotel. Seaport is within an easy walking distance, as are a number of other interesting destinations. We took taxi a few times into the theater district and museums areas which are only a couple of miles away, the taxi ride cost was consistently around $25 because of the traffic and took longer than the subway (but was convenient and less confusing than the subway). The cost of storing the car in the Hilton garage is $55 per day. There are additional charges if you take the car out during the stay. However, once someone sees Manhattan traffic the thought of taking out the car goes away. The only one slight negative: there is construction going on near 911 Memorial.

First of all the positives: great location in downtown manhattan, awesome concierge service, stylish lobby bar, decent room size and a great set of staff (bellboys/porters were the best for help with luggage and knowledge of the area). One massive negative: At the end of our second day we came home to find a note pushed under the door, this informed us very vaguely that smoke had been smelt at \"this end of the corridor\" and smoking was against the law in NY. Now we are both smokers but having been used to non smoking hotels in the UK for the past four years since the smoking ban we were fully aware that lighting up in the hotel room would not be allowed and so at no point at all during our stay did we smoke inside the hotel. Each morning we would go down to the designated smoking station outside the hotel for a cigarette (usually 6am-ish). Then we were out and about until late at night so usually were asleep as soon as our head hit the pillow. Due to this, we read the letter and because it didnt pinpoint our room directly, we honestly thought no more of it (in fact there was a small party going on in the room opposite us the night before so we put it down to this), The second day we returned after a long day of sight-seeing to find our keys didn't work. We were told on reception that the room had been deep cleaned due to us smoking in the room and a charge of $200 to cover this had been automatically applied to my credit card. I was struggling to speak I was so angry with what I was being told. \"Cigarette butts and ash have been located in your room this morning\" I was informed. This was categorically impossible as we had NOT smoked in the room. The manager then showed me a form that had been completed by housekeeping explaining all of this, and explained that it is their usual procedure to evidence the issue by taking photos to accompany the report, however, the maid had forgotten her camera that day and so no photos were available!!!! (This was laughable - the simple reason why no photos were available is because there was nothing to photograph!) My initial reaction was that they had the wrong room but I was told it was definately where we were residing that they had an issue. My next thought was that this was a scam against those the hotel were aware of as being smokers, there were a couple of open packets of cigarettes in our room as we would take a full packet out with us at the start of a long day, leaving the odd remains of the previous day's packet in the room. - could the maid have mistaken this for \"evidence\" of smoking in the room? The next day we met with the Housekeeping Manager, a lady called Sylvia. This involved a 20-minute back & forth discussion mainly consisting of them saying \"the room smelled of smoke, the housekeeper found butts and ash\" and us defending ourselves. I told them that this felt like a scam to get $200 out of those guests who are smokers which they denied it was. I also informed them of the exact times each morning that we had ventured outside for a cigarette (so they could confirm by CCTV if necessary) - why would we bother if we were lighting up in the room anyway? As the discussion was no where near a resolution Sylvia offered to reduce the charge to $100 (exactly what the charge covered was also unclear as nothing appeared to be \"cleaner\" than the day before). This angered me even more as the cost wasn't the main issue, it was the fact that we were being accused of doing something we hadn't done!. At this point Sylvia informed us that she would sit down with the housekeeper responsible for raising this the previous day and would get back to us straight away. Well, she didnt - and we needed to check out at 12 to get a flight to Vegas. However, we discovered on check out that the charge of $200 had been re-imbursed. I wanted to let any fellow smoking travellers know about this, it made me think of how many times they probably get away with it because individuals do not want the fuss or confrontaton involved whilst on holiday. It definately tainted our experienceof New York, which is a shame, as the rest of the trip including the sights, locals that we met and the food/drink were all fantastic.

However, the big disappointment came when I arrived in my smoking room to find cigarette butts in the ashtray and the waste bin still full. The bed was clean, but the room had a grubby air. Housekeeping quickly finished what should have been done before my arrival, but it was a terrible start and unique in my experience. It coloured the rest of my stay. On my first night, full of jetlag, I ordered room service and received soup which looked as if it came straight from a tin and a pizza that consisted of rubber cheese on a cardboard base - the worst pizza ever. Ever hopeful, I tried the restaurant on the next night and had a distinctly average, but very expensive meal. Fortunately, there are a few decent restaurants and bistros nearby and I would recommend these rather than the hotel restaurant. All in all, a disappointing stay and just about the worst value for money I have come across.", "Date": "September 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Leicestershire", "Title": "\u201cExcellent hotel in great location\u201d", "Author": "LeicJT", "ReviewID": "UR118409110", "Content": "This hotel is a great all rounder for service and location, overlooking ground zero and with the metro station outside its doors.

Maybe I was being too hopeful and a little ambitious and should have take the word of other reviewers on here wih a bit more notice, especially given that I was staying for 9 nights. Upon arrival, the actuall building looked quite nice and well maintained. The foyer and lobby bar on entrance were well looked after and still appeared fairly modern which you would expect from a rather new hotel such as this in comparison to others in the area. But that is where the compliments stop. It is very hard to describe how helpful the staff were as they were all extremely different. The men seemed to all be very helpful and always seemed more than happy to help while I honestly did not meet one female who could even afford a smile. I only dealt with 3 females on the front desk, and they were all very condescending in their approach and seemed to think that their job stopped at processing my payment. They really had no idea on the concept of customer service. When we finally got into our room(junior corner suite) I was pretty shocked at the state of everything. It looked like the hotel had been fitted out in the 80's and never updated since. The bed was very comfortable but probably about average for a Hilton bed. Certainly not as nice as those in Australia but still very comfortable nonetheless. We had wi-fi in our rooms but were expected to pay an exorbitant amount for it so decided against it. given the price of the hotel, and the fact there is a Starbucks downstairs with FREE wi-fi, there is definitely no need to fork out more cash. The showers double as bath tubs which I believe is not acceptable in a decent hotel, especially when decked out with cheap looking shower curtains. The bedroom lighting is very poor with only two small bedside lights for the bedroom. There are other lights for joining rooms which suffice however. We were extremely disappointed with the room service. We stayed during the recent hurricane/tropical storm and understand the limitations this placed on staff, but we were never even told that we would not have room service for the weekend. not that it really mattered, seeing though our room was only made up twice during how ENTIRE stay!!!! Not including the day we were checking out, where we had 2 staff cleaning while we were still in the room trying to relax before our long flight back to Australia. The noise of the construction next door can be annoying at times but we were aware of this from other reviews on here and given the circumstances, it's hard to criticize the hotel for that. During the hurricane we were forced to eat at the hotel restaurant. While I was fairly happy with the quality of food, the service was terrible. We had to wait 30 minutes before we were asked for our order. Then, before we could even finish telling him what we wanted he was off, without even asking for drinks or sides. We also had breakfast there which is ridiculously over priced. $6 for a small glass of orange juice or disgusting coffee? Who are they kidding!!!? We arrived just as the renovations were completed on the restaurant so we were expecting something special. Well, weren't we in for a shock. I seen the before and after photos and i really have no idea why they even bothered. Whether they failed to employ an interior designer or whether they had a budget of $50, I'm not sure, but the renovations were a joke. Apart from the new carpet it didn't look any different. While we were there they started renovations on the lobby bar which I didn't think really needed one anyway and when I left it didn't look like that was going to change much either really. The only plus side to our stay was the help of the concierge. He was a fantastic help and could not do enough to help us find our way around NYC. The only note I have with the concierge is that he finishes quite early and there should be an evening concierge as this is when a lot of patrons are in need of info for somewhere nice to eat. I am a member of the military which entitled me to a great discount. Without this, I would have been even more disappointed(if thats possible). I really hope that this hotel gets it's act together, especially the from desk female staff and improves because at the moment it's a scar on the Hilton name.", "Date": "September 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "HPT4Boston", "Title": "\u201cExcellent hotel for a nice price near Ground Zero\u201d", "Author": "HPT4Boston", "ReviewID": "UR118110927", "Content": "We loved this hotel.

The hotel is located directly across Church Street from the WTC site, and is convenient to most downtown locations. My room--on the 15th floor--was nice enough, but not special or memorable. Despite directly overlooking the WTC site and all of the construction going on, construction noise was not a problem--let's face it, most of downtown and midtown Manhattan is noisy anyway, so any construction noise just blended in an was easily ignored (plus, I stayed there 2 days before the 10th anniversary of 9/11, and construction activity was probably slowed down somewhat to accomodate memorial activities). Staff was not rude, but not particularly helpful or friendly. In fact , after checking out in the morning and checking our bags with the bell desk for a few hours, when my travel companions and I came back to the hotel mid-afternoon to pick up our bags from to head to the airport, some overzealous staff member accosted us (and most other patrons) as we walked in the door and demanded we show our room keys (which, having checked out, we didn't have, so we explained that we were there to pick up our bags) and made us feel uncomfortable and unwelcome--so much so that he essentially made us feel we needed to wait outside in the 90 degree heat for our airport transportation rather than waiting inside. This may have been attributable to increased security due to the 9/11 anniversary, but as ordinary, unassuming buisnesspeople wearing suits and ties one would think we wouldn't have looked like major security threats. I didn't think it was necessary to give us (and other patrons) the bum's rush. Technogically, my room was about 10 years behind the times. My room did not have wi-fi internet access (though apparently some in the other wing do). In an era when even damn near every Super 8 type motor lodge in places like East Bugtussle, Oklahoma has free wireless high-speed internet acess, it's inexcusable that a place frequented mostly by financial sector businesspeople on buisness trips in the most important financial center of America does not. The only internet access is through a wired ethernet connection, for which you will be charged about $15 a night, on top of the rather jaw-dropping room rate I was charged--and even at that, the router was unplugged when I got my room and required me to trace through a spaghetti bowl of dusty wires under the bed to find where to plug it in an get it powered up. About half the lights didn't work in the room either--I don't know if they were also unplugged or had blown bulbs. The TV was a modern, large flat-screen unit, but the signal was terrible--it looked like something you would see on a TV hooked up to a pair of 1950s rabbit ears. I was charged a rate of right around 500 bucks a night for this room. Even in Manhattan, $500 a night should get you a VERY nice place. This wasn't. Again, it's a great location for those traveling to the financial district on business, and the place is clean and comfortable enough, but overall it's mediocre and highly overpriced.", "Date": "September 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hatboro, PA", "Title": "\u201cHilton standard rooms but rough around the edges\u201d", "Author": "sshannon", "ReviewID": "UR117885467", "Content": "We stayed here Labor Day weekend, so first of all, I was a bit jarred, as a recent ex-NYer, by the tourist traffic on the sidewalk, so that perhaps colored my stay, but I did stay in this same hotel on September 11, 2010, in a last minute booking because it was available and I wasn't as affected by the tourist traffic. So, in the next couple of weeks after the 10th anniversary, the location next to the WTC is definitely a factor to consider. Having said that, if you have a room on the WTC side, you can spend some time viewing the site in peace - both times I stayed I had a WTC view even though I didn't request it either time. However, I was disappointed by the amenities at the hotel. I didn't pay a bargain rate for the hotel, so I was a bit dismayed to find out not only is the internet access in the room not wireless, it was also $14.95 a day. I think they get this complaint a lot because when I was trying to plead my case as a Hilton Honors member to the front desk, the front desk person corrected my $15 to $14.95 and just repeated the wired complaint like it was a matter of fact. I can deal with the internet charge, but then it became about the little things. The ice machine on our floor was broken, and we called down to report it. Nothing was done to address the broken machine during our two day stay. And finally, the elevators were ...taxed. Several times we waited five or more minutes for the elevators. None of this is tragic, and if my rate was less than $300, I probably wouldn't have noticed. Housekeeping was excellent, the room was comfortable, and the tv worked well, as I would expect from a Hilton hotel. I probably won't stay here again, unless I get a good deal, because the internet charge effectively raises the rate, and for me, the hyper NYer, the slow elevator is really problematic.

I was a bit concerned about construction noise after reading several reviews here, but those fears turned out to unfounded, at least when I stayed here mid-June. Being on a high floor certainly helped, but we may just have gotten lucky with the noise as I didn't notice much noise even on the street. The service was better than expected, even from Hilton. The front desk staff had no issue letting us check in a bit early when we arrived or leave our bags the last day. Everyone we dealt with was very polite and efficient. Housekeeping staff were very pleasant and actually tidied up the room twice a day. We were upgraded to a junior suite on a high floor, which was a pleasant surprise. The views from the room were phenomenal: WTC construction site on one side, statue of liberty on another, and a view of the Brooklyn bridge next to the elevator. The room was spacious, very clean, with all the amenities one would expect, including one of the most comfortable beds ever. Finally, the location is great. Directly beside one subway station and a minute or two walk from at least two others makes getting anywhere in NYC a breeze. Getting BACK, however, isn't quite as easy on the weekends due to Cortlandt station being under construction (downtown only) and the limited train service to downtown on the weekends (we ended up in Brooklyn on accident due to all trains being express).. The Church & Dey restaurant on the third floor is nice and has a decent breakfast, but for $23 per person it's about three times what it should be. Unless you get breakfast comped, pass on that. There are so many cheap, good places to eat in the city that there's no reason to eat here unless you are in a rush or, again, if you get it comped by the hotel.

By about 11.30pm it stopped and that was the only time during our 3 nite stay that we heard any noise. For breakfast, there's a great natural food eatery just around the corner from the hotel on Broadway that I would recommend. For dinner we would recommend Les Halles (French Bistro) a 5 min. walk from the hotel. Only real complaint was that due to construction at Ground Zero, several of the subway entrances were boarded up.

Here is the breakdown: PROS: -Location: If you like downtown NYC this is the perfect location. The hotel is located directly across the street from the new Liberty Tower complex and a few blocks from Wall Street and Battery Park. The subway station is 30 feet from the front entrance of the hotel and if you drive in (like we did) the hotel is located a block away from the West Side Highway and a short distance from the Holland Tunnel. If you are flying into JFK or LaGuardia the hotel is right over the Brooklyn Bridge and/or the Brooklyn Battery Tunnel. -Service Staff: The maids and maintenance men were very helpful and provided us with solutions to our hotel problems (see below). The maid staff was so nice that once they heard it was my boyfriend\u2019s birthday they left us two breakfast vouchers and a box of chocolates with a \"Happy Birthday\" note. -Room: Our room was newly renovated and immaculately clean with plenty of towels and pillows. I usually always have to request more towels and there were three large and many smaller ones. Also, the bath products were Crabtree & Evelyn, so they were good quality if you don't want to bring your own bath products from home. (no toothpaste though...lol). View-Even though the hotel sits directly across the street from ground zero we had a great view of the water through Battery Park. All rooms facing the street give you a nice view of the Hudson River and all the rooms facing the side will give you a view of the Statue of Liberty and waterways (I figure this specific view is for floors 20 and higher because the building next store is pretty short). CONS: Reservation & Requests: I booked this room directly through the Hilton website and got a wonderful deal ($189). Because of this deal when they offered an upper floor upgrade on the webpage after my confirmation I immediately jumped on it for an additional 18.99(An upper floor upgrade is considered any room above the 30th floor. The hotel has 55 floors and from what I have read if you are on a lower floor you get a significant amount of noise from the ground zero construction). Between the time of the reservation and day of arrival I called the hotel twice to confirm the upgrade and requests we made. We needed to request foam pillows and blankets because of allergies and a room on an upper floor. Upon arrival the front desk claimed that they had not received any of these requests, so the maid staff had to be inconvenienced by having to change all the bedding. Also, AND VERY IMPORTANT, the upper floor room upgrade is NOT GUARENTEED. The front desk employee was a bit rude in explaining that we can only get an upper floor upgrade if the rooms are available. So, even if you request an upper room they technically don't charge you the 18.99 until you get there and if the room is available. I thought they charged us already and we were guaranteed an upper floor. We were pretty lucky though because we were on the 30th floor, which is the highest level of the \"lower\" rooms. Room Temperature & Thermostat: I know this is an odd topic but when we entered our room it was a bit muggy and warm so I automatically went to the thermostat and turned the air conditioning on and assumed that the room would cool off quickly (like most hotels). After an hour and a half the room was still muggy and warm so I called down to the front desk and they sent up a maintenance staff member. When the gentleman got to our room he explained that during the winter/spring months the hotel \"NEUTURALIZES\" the air system, meaning that they turn off the chiller for the conditioning unit. So, he showed us how to open the windows and told us the room would cool off that way. Unfortunately, our window made a terrible buzzing sound every time the wind got heavy (which for the city is very frequent). So, when maintenance came back up they put caulking in the window and said that should be fine. Also, management is able to turn the chillers on in each room and they refused too for us. Extras: Most hotel rooms come with a refrigerator; this hotel charges you to rent one. Also, the hotel parking was $55 for the night (which is pretty normal but still high). There was no free continental breakfast, we got free vouchers from the maid but the food was TERRIBLE. If you can avoid the hotel breakfast please do so. Noise from Ground Zero: The hotel staff is pretty rude about this. Obviously, there is no way to avoid hearing the construction noise because they work 24 hours a day, 7 days a week because they are behind schedule. While the hotel does provide ear plugs I found that if you request a higher floor you don't hear any noise. Plus, with your air unit running it helps drown out any additional noise also. All in all I would stay here again. It was the best price I have ever gotten in the city for a nice hotel. I don't like being nickeled and dimed for everything but when we needed help the service staff were professional and nice.", "Date": "April 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ottawa, Canada", "Title": "\u201cBeats than staying in Midtown.\u201d", "Author": "Timbointheapple", "ReviewID": "UR103616553", "Content": "I decided to stay here on during a recent visit to NYC because a lot of the activities I wanted to do were found in Lower Manhattan.

We loved the location as you can witness history and view the future with what they're doing at the WTC site. As most reviews tell you the construction noise is an ongoing issue with the deadline for the tenth anniversary fast approaching and the need to complete the memorial before 9/11/11. The noise is not particularly bothersome but our room locations were on the 32nd and 47th floor giving us great distance from the work. The junior suite was a corner location and it had two adjoined rooms by a walkway which the bathroom was situated off of. The windows spanned this walkway and for 180 degrees around our bedroom. We had both a large flat screen in the living room and bedroom but they didn't carry an HD signal(why?). The room was very nicely appointed and maybe getting a bit dated but we didn't mind. The bathroom is large enough for two with mirror stretching to the ceiling and the shower was powerful and hot. Everything in the room very clean and shiny and the windows spotless for great views North and over the WTC site. The bed was comfortable, large, and supportive with plenty of room for two and it helped that when rising it didn't disturb the other sleeper. Our next room was a better one. It was smaller in area but the bedroom was larger overall. We again had a corner location giving us magnificent views of the Statue of Liberty in one window and the Brooklyn Bridge in the other. This room was duly appointed like the last and we like the espresso machine included in all rooms which is great pick-me-up when needed. Now for the bad which has turned me off the Hilton name that was once the standard bearer for good hotels. Our check-in times was both long and seemingly arduous (since we had two separate reservations they wouldn't allow us to check in once for both). We waited for quite a few minutes and what was strange was that a staff member would check in someone and then instead of helping the next guest, disappear into the back room or leave the area for a while. It happened on both occasions and to many of the guests even as we were just hanging around the lobby. We noticed some people annoyed with the waiting and who wouldn't be; there was many staff mulling around that desk but sometimes just one person checking people in. In addition, the check-in staff twice tried to get us to stay in the junior suite rather than moving to our new room. I didn't want to do this as I knew we'd get better views with our other reservation for the higher floors. The only thing I can think of is that it makes their job easier to keep us in one room and maybe they can make more money by having another high end room open for Saturday and Sunday night. Another sad surprise was that on a weekend the bar area would close before midnight. Thinking that this is NY and a weekend night you would think they would have it open till at least 1am. Maybe they've had trouble with drunk people as the bar is an open area next to the lobby but we were disheartened to not finish with a nightcap after taking in the city. Another minor issue I had was the restaurant wouldn't serve me a dessert that I could take to my room. The waiter politely said to get room service and I know it's available but again this was after coming back to the hotel and I didn't see what the problem could be by me doing this. (And yet another minor issue is no free wi-fi. Do you have to charge for every little thing Hilton? Fifteen bucks for an all day pass! I pay less for my monthly world access account!) My main problem was a toilet issue. The toilets are low flow for water conservation which is smart and I'm an eco person. But after doing my business ours got clogged. After trying to flush it down I had to call for help. It took 15 minutes to get someone up and it was a guy armed with a plunger. He got it working and I felt bad that someone had to deal with my waste like that. But after he left there was water spilled over the floor and toilet. He didn't think he needed to clean anything after plunging the heck out of the toilet! So I wiped up the floor and toilet but regretted not mentioning this to the manager. Some of these reviews talk about the staff with a \"that's how it is\" attitude and I concur with their assessment. It seems they are not really concerned with putting a good image out there for the hotel. They seem dismissive and disregarding of whatever happens around them. As I think how I didn't talk to a manager I find with other reviewers that it most likely wouldn't have mattered anyway. The only good staff are the concierge who are eager to help you with directions and having a good time in the city. So we had great views and a comfortable room. But the downside being the staff, no extra benefits staying at a Hilton and finding inconvenient surprises during our stay.", "Date": "March 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Homestead, Florida", "Title": "\u201cNot the Hilton You Expect\u201d", "Author": "kenmbender", "ReviewID": "UR98559430", "Content": "We had some extra time, so decided to spend the Thanksgiving holiday in NYC (and catch the Macy's parade). We wanted a brand hotel and not a boutique place. We also wanted to be downtown. The hotel itself is in an absolutely fantastic location. Access to pretty much all of the subway lines - they are all within a few blocks and 2 of them are right there. Century 21 is right next door so you can't beat that. Our room was mid floor and looked down on the WTC site. We had heard comments about the noise of construction, but we never heard a thing. It must have been the height. The rooms themselves are in need of updating. While the bed and other furniture are newer, the infrastructure is definitely in need of work. The air handler was either on full blast or not at all. The thermostat worked when it wanted to - which meant either the room was too hot or too cold. This made it a little tough to sleep. When asked, the front desk almost acknowledged there might be issues with some older equipment. Housekeeping made the bed and provide new toiletries, but seemed to lack the ability to clean other parts of the room. It appeared the spaces behind the desk, around the air handler, within 6 inches or so of any piece of furniture was off limits to cleaning as was any flat surface like the desk, armoire, nightstands, table or countertop. For the most part the staff was helpful, albeit not engaging. The exception was the concierge desk. They were extremely helpful and knowledgeable. Not only were their directions precise, but they gave landmarks as well \"you will see ..... when you get there\". The final piece of this trip was the bar area. It seems as though housekeeping doesn't even cover this area, and neither does any other staff. The chairs were stained, the tables dirty and there were food bits all over the floor. We decided one night to have a Manhattan (since we were IN Manhattan). This is, by far, the worst cocktail I have ever charged for. Part of the issue was the lack of service. After waiting 15 minutes for a server - which we had seen when we sat down, but had disappeared within seconds, we grew tired of waiting and approached the bar and placed our order. The standard garnish for the cocktail is a cherry, so we were surprised when they were made without. When questioned, the bartender (and we are assuming that is what he was since I had to interrupt his daydreaming to ask for a cocktail) shrugged his shoulders and said that's how he makes them. We sat back down and the mystery server came back. I asked about the garnish and was informed that they did not use cherries. When she saw the questioning look, she explained this was a corporate decision. Hilton did not serve cherries. (When we got home I called Hilton and asked and was told that is specific to that location). When we were almost done with our whiskey - I can't call it a cocktail, the server came over to take the order of a table that had just sat down. She provided them with bar munchies. This may be trivial, but we really felt like we had not been treated with the same level of service as the other folks. We went to our room, packed and got ready to leave as our flight out was the next morning. Needless to say, we will not be returning to this location. When we returned home, I contacted Hilton and provided these comments, which were then relayed to the hotel.

The prices are high (as would be expected) and I found the bar a little to close to the lobby traffic - there is little to differentiate between lobby and bar.

My requirements are a clean, four star, safe hotel. I don't care where in the city that I stay as I love to explore new areas of the city. I booked this hotel on Priceline. Priceline says it is four stars but it is not and there are two main reasons. 1. There was a letter in my room upon check that said that Ground Zero construction is not 24 hours a day and they are sorry for the noise but deadlines are to be met. The note was accompanied by earplugs. I kid you not, earplugs. The hotel was sold out so I was stuck in the room. Besides the view of ground zero (which is not very four star and very sad and depressing) the fact that construction went on all night and was loud was horrible. I would never wear earplugs in a hotel room. I need to be able to hear if there was a fire alarm or other danger. 2. There is no WIFI in the hotel. I have not been in any good hotel in the past three years that does not offer WIFI. The room had a phone cord modem available at a price. My Ipad and phone need WIFI not a phone modem. This is totally antiquated. The room was clean but a little dated, especially the bathroom. The neighborhood has no nightlife and is actually dark to walk around at night.

On arrival to the hotel at about 5pm, my first impression was that it looked very cosy and comfortable, with a beautifully decorated large Christmas tree in the lobby area. Ater checking in which was very swift, we were shown to our room which was on the 14th floor, facing Century 21 depatment store. The room was very clean and modern, however I was quite surprised to find two double beds (more like a one and half persons when compared to UK size) instead of the triple room we had booked. This was not a problem as after a quick phonecall to the reception desk, there was a third bed set up in our room when we got back that night. The Hotel is well aware that some guests are not happy with the noise levels coming from the construction site, that they provide earplugs to ensure you get a peaceful night sleep - however we found that these were not needed as you could hardly hear anything other than a very low vibrating sound, which is drowned out if you have the heating system on. Overall our stay was very pleasant, even though we only spent our time at the hotel sleeping (which was for a total of only about 10 hours during our time there), All the staff at the hotel were very friendly and helpful, even allowing us to check out at the later time of 3.30pm as opposed to the 12pm check out time, as our flight wasn't due to leave until late that evening. All requests we made were met very promptly and without any problems at all, which made our break a very enjoyable experience.

If you don't know by know, this hotel is directly across from the former Twin Towers site, which is under constant construction. In fact, our room looked directly into the construction pit. There are lots of reviews on TripAdvisor where people are complaining about the noise. Ignore these! These people either did no research into the hotel, or just like to complain. Remember, this is Manhattan, so any hotel has some street noise during the day. I didn't hear noise at night at all. But the hotel makes it clear on its website that the surrounding streets are under constant construction (even on Weekends), and the hotel even offered ear plugs. The location of the hotel is great for exploring lower Manhattan. The South St Seaport, Staten Island Ferry, and local city boat tours are all within close walking distance. And there is good subway access, as the hotel is near the 1,2,3, and N,R,Q trains which easily get you uptown. The lobby is small for a major Hilton Hotel, and often very crowded. That being said, Check-IN and Out were swift and uncomplicated. I used HHonors points for my stay, so I can't speak to the value or price of the hotel, but I have a feeling it is average price for large NYC hotel. That being said, I have said at new Hiltons that probably cost less and are just a shade nicer. The room was small, which is to be expected in NYC. The bed is very comfy, the pillows are just way too soft. The bathroom, while also small, looked a little beat up, which was unexpected for a nice Hilton. They offered free continental breakfast coupons which was more than acceptable. My biggest gripe with the hotel is the room service. First, they don't offer a printed menu, only one on a special hotel channel on the TV. It is a pain to use as you can't search. You have to sit and wait for it to cycle through if you miss something. Second, the pricing is ridiculous!!! My wife and I just did dessert one night, and ordered a ice cream sundae and a piece of cake. The total bill was $50 including the delivery charges and included tips. And the desserts really weren't that good!!! In NYC we would normally not do hotel dessert, but in that part of the city, there aren't many after-hours/late night restaurants. Overall, a nice place to stay. I'm glad my room was free.

The bell boy on the side street got confused because he thought we didn't tip him for handling our luggage, but my brother in law had given him $12 but he was expecting the tip from me, so he was very rude and loud to me when he suggested that he had done his service and now it was my turn to pay up!!

If you get a room facing west, you will get a very good view of Ground Zero and of the construction that is going on to rebuild it. I would say that the view you would get from one of the rooms here is one that you will never forget. You cannot help but think about what it was like on the morning of September 11, 2001. We could not imaging being a guest in this hotel on that day. The hotel sustained severe damage during the attacks, but it re-opened in 2003 and it is truly amazing that the hotel survived. The location is a good one. There are subway stations right in front of the hotel, so getting around the city is easy. The hotel is in lower Manhattan, so places like the financial district, and the South Street Seaport are nearby (but with the subway, everything is easy to get to). Yes, the area around it is very busy, but this is New York City--would you have it any other way? During our most recent trip, we booked a junior suite, which was wonderful since it had a small living room area separate from the bed. The room was also very bright, with windows facing west and north. Because of this, our views were spectacular. The construction at Ground Zero is constant. You will hear it, but honestly, it was not bothersome. If staying in a hotel directly across from Ground Zero seems a bit strange, even disrespectul to you, I would ask you to reconsider. By staying at the Millenium Hilton, you will be contributing to the re-growth of lower Manhattan, which was devestated on 9/11.

No greeting from the Service Desk Attendant; had to wait on her to come over to check us in....We were then told that there was a lot of construction around the hotel and that if we needed them we could come get ear plugs from the front desk. Dont you think that might be something that they should notify us about when we make the reservation? And if it's that bad, why not just leave a pair of plugs in the room.

Later on, my husband and I took a nap after dinner before we went out to explore Times Square at night. I was woken my a phone call in my room that I did not make it to. Then a few minutes later, a knock on the door by a security guard. I told him to hold on, and that I was not yet dressed. I quickly threw on my robe and as I was opening the door, the man already had his key card in my door and was preparing to enter on his own, even though he had heard me. Not cool. He tells me I need to go downstairs and speak to the manager. But does not tell me why. What? I tell him I'll be down in a minute after I get dressed. No sooner had I put on shoes when I heard another knock at the door. A second security guard, telling me I need to come with him. When I get to the manager, he tells me that they had woken my husband and I up at 10:30pm because we had ordered the $14.99 in-room internet earlier in the day, but they did not have a card number on file for us. Ok, #1- I paid for the room up front with a credit card? So how do I not have one on file? #2- This is only my first night @ 10:30pm. I've already prepaid for 2 nights and 3 calendar days of valet. Surely you can assume that I'm good for another $15 dollars in the morning. #3 - They had not had our breakfast tickets ready when we checked in and were supposed to leave them under our door that night. Could they not have just left a note with the tickets and asked us to bring our CC to the desk in the morning when we went to breakfast? That would have been a bit more guest-friendly don't you think? The breakfast bar there is $50/person. So they technically still owed us 4 tickets worth a sum of $200 because they were not prepared when we checked in. But they will wake us up and have me escorted by security to see the manager at 10:30pm over my $14.99 wireless internet charge on my own room #, becasue they forgot to put the credit card number on file for any extras. Seriously? This hotel needs some serious lessons on ediquet and guest service. I was extreemly disappointed and frustrated on how they handled this situation.

Then to top off the ordeal, they had still not delivered our $200 worth of breakfast passes when we got up to go eat in the morning. We still had to go down to the desk to pick them up before we went back upstairs to the dinning room. Again, what's with the service at this hotel? I've always enjoyed the Hiltion hotels and have relied in the \"brand\" of thier hotel chain. But the staff and poor service experienc at the Millenium has negatively altered my perception.....I do hope that this is not the typical experience of the hotel's patrons, and that it will be read and taken as a learning experience for the hotel staff. We were there for vacation and a fun, care-free get away.

I got a great deal on a Junior City-View Suite. I love staying in the city suites b/c the view is amazing. I was high enough to not really hear the construction. I think the A/C unit is what really makes all the noise in the rooms and people just think its the construction. I ended up turning off the A/C my entire stay. I used the lobby bathroom and that was pretty gross. They should clean that more often. I passed by the pool and it is so small. I also looked at the menu but the food was way over priced. I ended up going to soho and tribeca to eat since there really isn't anything nearby the hotel. I really like the location of the hotel Its walking distance to pier 17, battery park, and tribeca, and Its just a train ride to central park and time square. Everyone says wait until the construction is complete to stay at the hotel..but I think thats the best part of the hotel. I love seeing how much they have completed since the last time I was here. I always take pictures to record the progress. I also think that when they actually do finish the WTC Construction the price is going to be rediculous. I think paying 194 a night for my suite was pretty good but eventually I could see that price zooming up to 400-600 a night. My advice if you really want to stay here but are worried about the noise is to try and come during a holiday. I was there on 4th of July and It seemed like there was no construction the 4th and 5th of july. So im assuming all major holidays would be a great time to stay here.

Having checked in and arrived in my room the noise was deafening that was coming from Ground Zero some 40 floors below. The room was clean if a little small and came with a lovely big television. My one major criticism with Hilton Hotels is the lack of a free Internet service but even if you did pay there is no Wi-Fi in the hotel rooms just in the lobby. The hotel also doesn\u2019t offer complimentary breakfast which I knew about but having stayed in another Hilton two weeks previous it did offer complimentary breakfast. I think Hilton should perhaps have a standard policy on breakfasts, and for the price customers pay for rooms you would really expect a breakfast. There was a coffee maker in the room though which is always handy. The view from the room was superb but the noise was very loud although we assumed that the construction work would cease before night. How wrong were we! The work and extreme noise (drilling concrete) was continuous and was as clear as day through the ear plugs I had with me. Nowhere on Hotels.com did it mention that this noise would be apparent so I will be taking matters further with them. Come 1am the noise was still extremely loud so I went to reception and enquired about it and they said it is 24 hours a day 7 days a week and they couldn\u2019t do much about it. The girl at the front desk was very pleasant and offered a room change which I gratefully accepted. The room was on the same floor but on the opposite side of the hotel. Although quieter the noise coming from Ground Zero could still be heard in the room and with ear plugs it was a constant humming noise reverberating right up through the bed and into your ears\u2026 very annoying and hard to sleep with. There is also the occasional horn sounding from the harbour area. Although the noise is not something the hotel has direct response over (they offer earplugs and sound reducing machines) if I had have been made aware that noise was present I would not have booked the hotel. I thought I was getting a good rate and now I know why but that is something I will be taking up with Hotels.com. Upon checking out I had two concierge staff trying to help me with bags and getting a taxi. However, one was quite rude to the other in front of me when he told his colleague to shut a door even though he had to retrieve another one of my bags which he obviously made him aware of! For the price of a room now and even more so pre-construction I would expect breakfast and complimentary Wi-Fi but the hotel did not offer this. The rooms however, are nicer than most hotel rooms and the reception staff member I dealt with was very nice and polite.

This is the FIRST time I have written negatively about service (I honestly am not picky and will stay at a motel 6, etc.). First, the room. Very clean, warm hallways, cool in the room. Bathroom was a mid-range space, not four star. Basic, some outdated fixtures, good size. Room itself good size for NYC. Bed very comfortable, chair and ottoman clean but starting to show wear. Coffee maker and desk area good. TV console great size, minibar fridge stocked (and of course, expensive). View gorgeous over into New Jersey and over the WTC work site. About the noise - we were on the 24th floor and could hear some rumbles, but it did not upset any sleep. Hotel public spaces not impressive, again, basic. Quick check in, elevators, front desk and front doors all within 40 steps. No grand lobby here. ON TO SERVICE. I promise that I am not picky, yet when I stay at (and pay for) a 4-star hotel, I expect service that makes me feel somewhat special (anything - a welcome note, door help, anything). First, I walked in carrying two large shopping bags and a purse. Went through the revolving door with a door/bell man outside and one inside, no help offered (eve though it isn't that large of a lobby, there should be some help offered to guests). After checking in, still no help offered for carrying bags after passing a different bellman. This is not 4 star service - I wasn't even asked by reception if I needed help, had a preference for floor or beds, etc. Went in and out of the hotel at least 4 times first day, and never a door held open when I did not use the revolving door. HERE IS THE REAL COMPLAINT! The next morning, and this is the kicker, housekeeping knocked and came in the room THREE TIMES while we were sleeping!!! at 8:30am, I did not hear a knock (sleeping), but heard my door open and housekeeping talking to each other and walk in. They then saw us in bed and closed the door. At 9:45, I heard knocking, then the door open AGAIN! I shouted out that we were in the room, and they left. At 11 or so, they knocked once again, but this time I put the security lock on (I must have forgot) so they couldn't get all the way in. FYI - checkout is not until NOON!!!!! At 11:40 a gentleman knocked on our door (we were packing up) and asked if we were leaving!!!!! Of course we are - after we CHECKOUT! I have worked hotels - a simple report shows what guests have checked out. I was appalled that at a 4 star hotel I would be awoken twice by housekeeping HOURS before checkout, then twice more been bullied out. Absolutely unacceptable. Overall, would NOT stay here again unless desperate or paid almost nothing. Felt overpriced for the room - even in NYC. To deal with poor service, less than stellar accommodations, etc, but have to pay for 4-stars is not okay.

I had checked in while the hotel restaurant was between service but the recommended Stage Door Deli was just a short block away and I grabbed breakfast and lunch from there during my stay. Best thing besides the glorious bed? And views? A nice, deep, cast iron tub that I filled to the brim and luxuriated in a relaxing bubble bath each evening.

I had to plan ahead a bit and stop at a drugstore to find some.) Only issue -- I need more / better task lighting while working at the desk in my room.

We booked this hotel because it's within walking distance of the office. Whenever people asked where we were staying, they seemed impressed when we told them \u201cthe Millennium Hilton\u201d but I\u2019ve been telling them just how unimpressive it is: At $318 a night, it isn't cheap, but then again, no where in NYC is! They charge your credit card up front for your entire stay and I hadn't deposited the full amount yet so my card declined. They were willing to just charge two nights to get me checked in. I immediately transferred the necessary funds to cover the whole stay, went back down (the same day) and asked to have the rest charged/approved/held. I was told I was all set however, today (3 days later) when I got back to my room, the key didn't work. I had to go all the way back down and ask the front desk to charge my card again. The girl at the desk told me that my card had been declined 3 times and I could not use it. I told her I knew the money was there but she didn't care, told me to go get cash, and kept my key--she refused to do anything to help me and was a complete snob about the whole thing--I was LIVID. I wasn't about to walk 7 blocks to my bank (which I just came from btw) so I called my bank to double check the available amount before doing anything else. When I confirmed that I had 6 times the required amount (no different than 10 minutes ago when she refused my card), I went back to another front desk clerk (who wasn\u2019t an idiot) and he had no problem with my card. Then when I went back to my room (receipt in hand) my key still didn't work so I had to wait for security to let me in. The view is interesting (beautiful but sad--you are looking directly out onto the WTC site) but the noise from the construction really is non-stop (I was on the 33rd floor and it wasn\u2019t too bad at night, some people might be bothered by it though). What was REALLY noisy was actually the air conditioner! With the temperature set at 68, it was on constantly and full blast. With the temperature set at 72, the heat came on. At 70, it went back and forth between the A/C, heat, and being off. Whenever it was on--either hot or cold--it was LOUD. It knocks horribly--sound like the construction at the WTC is being done on your window. For a \u201cbusiness\u201d oriented hotel, it is just mind boggling that internet access in the rooms is NOT FREE and that, if you do get internet access, it\u2019s not wireless! I heard that Hilton Rewards members got a choice between free internet and free breakfast (yeah folks, the breakfast isn\u2019t free either--they charge you for everything you need!) so I signed up. As a state employee, I knew from other employees who had stayed here that you get the same choice. I figured I\u2019d get the internet as a state employee and breakfast as a rewards member\u2026NO! You still only get one or the other. Big rip off. One of my colleagues was charged $5 just for opening the door to the minibar. In the hotel\u2019s defense, they did reverse the charge, but that is the most ridiculous thing I\u2019ve ever heard of! I assume they do it because it\u2019s a small enough charge that many people won\u2019t even notice it. To me, that\u2019s unethical and greedy and makes for TERRIBLE customer service. Because of it, I was afraid to touch or use anything in the room for fear I would get charged an absurd amount (they do NOT make it clear what is free and what they are going to charge you for). Now, again, I know NYC is expensive, but when I go back to Syracuse this weekend, I\u2019ll be staying at a Super 8 that has bigger rooms, free wi-fi, free breakfast, and front desk employees that know how to charge a credit card and it\u2019ll cost me around $70 a night! The Hilton staff needs to remember that without service, a hotel is just four walls and a bed--no one is going to choose your hotel over another if you treat people like walking credit cards instead of human beings.

The next day we approached the front of house desk and was advised that double bed meant 2 beds, not 2 double beds. I then asked if they have ever been to the room to view the room in which the answer was No.....Again the response from the front of house staff was \"so what is the question\" Due to the fact that the Hilton had our money we stayed in the hotel which I must say would be one of the most overated Hotels I have ever stayed in. The staff are rude and aggressive with very little local knowledge and present very little customer service. We Stayed the last night in New York in a Hotel around the corner called \"The Reserve Hotel \" a great little 3 star hotel with rooms with 2 Double beds, free Internet in room internet access and great service.

The hotel is beautiful - well kept, modern, with a friendly staff. Our room was average sized for a NYC hotel (probably a bit smaller than you'd expect in other cities, but not too small for two adults). The room was extremely clean, as was the bathroom, and featured all modern furniture and fixtures - including a large flat screen TV, wired internet (for a fee, no wireless in guest rooms), coffee/tea service, and minibar (which was extremely overpriced - $5 for a CAN of soda or juice is beyond ridiculous, but I normally skip the minibar anyway). The bathroom was a good size with marble counter tops and shower back splash; however, the most important thing to point out is that it was VERY clean and well kept. That's the shining point to this hotel - they really do a fantastic job of keeping it looking \"shiny and new.\" The hotel itself is located on the cusp of Tribeca and the Financial District, literally across from Ground Zero (we were mislead by another website that said the hotel was in SoHo, and only learned the property name and address AFTER booking, so beware!). Probably not the best location if you're a leisure traveler, as the area gets pretty dead at night, and businesses close early, but there are a few places that stay open late to catch a good late-night meal. BonChon Chicken on John Street, and Harry's Italian on Gold Street are both great places to eat within a 5-10 minute walk of the hotel, and serve dinner until at least 11PM (even on Sundays!). There's also never a shortage of ground transportation around the hotel, as there are Subway stops in front of and behind the property, as well as a steady stream of taxis driving by. As mentioned before, the property sits directly across from Ground Zero. The hotel does advise you that the construction from Ground Zero continues around the clock, and that they have ear plugs and noise machines to help combat some of the sounds. They're not kidding. Despite getting a great deal at this property, I would NOT stay here again until the construction at Ground Zero is complete (which won't be for another few years, unfortunately). It MIGHT be a different story if you have a room facing the OTHER side of the hotel, but we were put on the 23rd floor in a room that faces Ground Zero and the East River (nice view, by the way). Most of the \"loud\" construction work is finished up by 11PM, meaning it's possible to fall asleep with the low, constant hum of what I can only guess is a generator. However, at 6/6:30AM EVERY morning (yes, weekends included), they start up first thing with the jackhammer, making getting any decent sleep impossible. If I were a business traveler, this probably wouldn't be too much of a hindrance, as I'd probably be awake by then. However, when I'm on vacation, I like to stay out late, and sleep in sometimes, something which is IMPOSSIBLE to do, right now at least, at the Millenium Hilton. I would recommend this property to anyone AFTER the construction at Ground Zero is complete. It truly is a lovely hotel, and they staff are great. However, I absolutely refuse to stay here again, until the construction is finished.

And at night the view was breath taking. I ordered room service one night I got a chicken wrap and soup ....which came out to be 45 dollars! The food was good...but not 45 dollars good. So here are my problems. The vents!!!!! Everyone complained about the noise of ground zero but the heat vents were worst. And of course the vents only made wierd noises at like 4 am when I was asleep. I eventually just turned off the heat and added an extra blanket to my bed which worked out fine. About the ground zero construction: I assume that i got such a good deal on the room b/c of the construction noise. $700 (w/tax) for three nights at a cityview suite is a pretty good deal for new york city. What I advise everyone to do is just stay at this hotel but stay in the city view rooms just b/c they are so high up you barely hear the noise. The location was great for me. I did all the touristy things on past trips so i didnt want to stay in time square or by central park. The hotel is walking distance to the south street seaport which was amazing. I recommend going there, as well as visiting the brooklyn botanical gardens and prospect park. I will be staying here again.

After hunting for what seemed to be weeks for a decently priced hotel during this busy time, we settled on the Millennium Hilton as the prices seemed to be the most reasonable. Upon arrival (which was very early - around 8 am) we were pleasantly surprised that a room was ready for us (check in is not supposed to be until 3 pm). We were a bit disappointed however to find that the extra money we paid to be in the \"city view\" rooms (floors 31-55) resulted in us being put on floor 36, but what can you do. Upon entering our room, the first thing we noticed was the ground zero construction noise. I'm not going to lie, it's pretty loud. We went downstairs to ask if they had anything higher up to escape the noise, but they informed us everything was full already. Fortunately, the construction noise was very easy to get used to, and it only woke me up once (on the very first night) in our 7 day stay, so what we thought was a big deal at first turned out to be something pretty minor. As for the location, we found this hotel to be in a perfect spot for what we were in NYC to do. We were, of course, in New York for New Year's Eve, but didn't want to stay too close to the festivities. This hotel has a Southbound subway station right outside the door, and a Northbound one less than a block away. It is walking distance to all of the Financial District sights (Wall street, Battery Park, St. Paul's Chapel and Trinity Church). If you enjoy a nice walk, you can also walk all the way up to the Empire State in probably 30 - 45 mins, as well as Little Italy and Chinatown in about 20 mins. The nice thing about staying in the Financial District is the peace and quiet at night, once all the business people have gone home from work! Regarding the staff, some of them do seem to think the Hilton is comparable to the Plaza, and that you should feel lucky to be staying there. Also, everyone seems to expect a tip nowadays, even if they're simply moving your luggage from the front desk to a locked room right next to the front desk....something that I don't quite agree with. Overall, I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone who is traveling to NYC on business or pleasure, however if you are an extremely light sleeper you might want to think twice regarding the noise at WTC.", "Date": "January 30, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington, DC", "Title": "\u201cBest choice in Lower Manhattan...one of the best in NY\u201d", "Author": "wuz-in-tha-biz", "ReviewID": "UR54696588", "Content": "I spent a wonderful birthday at the Millenium Hilton in lower Manhattan. My high-floor room overlooked ground zero...while many people find this view a bit morbid, I find it fascinating to stand and stare at a piece of history, and new history being made every day. On the clear days, we could see the Statue of Liberty, the WFC, ships on the Hudson, and across to New Jersey (I think as far as the TV towers in the Meadowlands.) The otherside of the hotel has views of the Brooklyn Bridge and the Lower East Side. The room is much better than a typical Hilton...very urban minimalist...but bright. Somewhat reminiscent of how Kimpton decorates their rooms. The rooms are small, as are all rooms in New York, but this hotel did a great job designing the interiors to maximize space and efficiency. Flat panel TV on the wall, built-ins, etc. Bathroom was large and clean, but more of the typical Hilton design. The hotel pool is awesome, as is the fitness center. Location is great in Lower Manhattan...shopping is pretty good, especially the J&R Electronics around the corner. Several 24hour pharmacies/convenience stores and a 24 hour McDonalds, as well as a Backstage Deli and many higher end restaurants are in easy walk. The Church across the street is quite historical...I think J.J. Astor is buried there. Wall St, the Federal Reserve, and Battery Park are sights in easy walking distance from the Millenium Hilton. The PATH trade center line terminates directly across from the hotel, and several subway lines are accessbie from the same block. While many of NYC's sights are uptown, they're still pretty accessible from this hotel due to the subway. Also, if you don't mind walking 20 or 25 minutes, you can be in the East or West Villiage without even using the subway. TriBeCa and SoHo are also walking distance. There's not much nightlife right around the hotel, but if you can't find something in SoHo, TriBeCa, or the Villiage, then you shouldn't be in New York to begin with. About parking: Yes, I drove into the city. Valet parking was ridiculously expensive (something like $55 a day!) but on the weekends you can park on the abandoned lower Manhattan streets without having to pay anything at all. Just make sure you're gone before 5 AM come Monday morning. If you're staying through the week, I'.d suggest parking at a PATH station in NJ and riding the train over, or somewhere in Brooklyn and either walking across the Bridge or taking the subway. Excellent public transit connections. I did not eat the food at the hotel, but I did walk by the restaurant and it looked quite chic, but kind of empty. Take what you will from that observation.

The drawers were spacious enough to unpack for 3 days and not live out of luggage bags. We had a room facing the Hudson River and the two bridges \u2013 Brooklyn and Manhattan.

It was pretty cold- freezing actually- during our stay so I actually wanted to use the coffee/tea maker. It\u2019s a great machine that allows for both coffee and tea brewed at the same time. No coffee taste in my hot water as with other makers! Since the room only had one tea bag, two liquid creamers (the good stuff!) and two sugar packets I called the front desk to request more. Within 20 minutes housekeeping was up to my room with a bag full of cream and sugar. Great service! The hotel is within 2 blocks of a subway lines that will get you anywhere. We enjoyed leaving the crowd at Times Square area and returning to the more quiet, peaceful Financial District area. Didn\u2019t mind at all having to show our room cards at night for added security. One morning we had an early start and had breakfast delivered by Champs Deli (www.champsdelinyc.com) located a few blocks away from the hotel. Not only was it convenient, but an inexpensive, delicious start to a full day. While I would not consider staying here when traveling on a tight budget (which I often do) since there are so many choices in Manhattan, I would recommend this as a great value if you\u2019re already spending Times Square area prices.

With his regular bedtime CD and the white noise machine, he didn't wake at all the first night. The second night he did, but he was with a sitter and our neighbors down the hall were very loud. So, noise is definitely a consideration... but in our case, not a deal breaker. 2) The staff was all incredibly friendly and we never had to wait for anything.

This was my first time in NY and my first time in Hilton chain. I was arriving from a long trip, I was more than 24 hrs sleepless and my bf and I arrived very early morning. He has some frequent client status with Hilton so he adviced we would arrive early. The room was still not ready... We asked for room on highest floors to avoid the ground zero noise and we said we would not mind to wait a bit longer. As he had traveled to NY for work he left me at the lobby and I gave them my cell phone number to advice when the room was ready. He asked if they had the information of his credit card . The receptionist adviced everything was fine. It passed 3 hrs and they never called me or let me know anything. Even I was sitting just in front of the reception. I had to ask if they had news about my room. Then the receptionist realized she was suppossed to call me. When I tried to check in they asked me for another credit card cause my bf's credit card did not work. I gave them 3 different credit cards and none worked what it was very strange cause I have used them all around the world and I've never had problems before but with Hilton. I even use them in NY to pay for everything. I called my bf and he asked them to try with another of his credit cards but they demanded him to be there personally.They said the only way they could check me in was for me to call my bank in front of them to authorize the charge or my bf to go to the hotel and do the same. He verified the information by their website and realized the credit card in his profile had a wrong expiration date. We both adviced that to front desk staff and they insist they could not try to charge the credit card again and they demanded him to check in phyisically. Finally he called the manager and she agreed to try to charge his credit card again and it worked. We both spent lot of time trying to convince them to change the expiration date. Then I asked for my bags to the storage guy. No one helped me to take my bags to the room even they saw how I could not handle pulling two huge bags. A guest who was in the lobby had to help me to take all my stuff to the elevator. My boyfriend complained again when he arrived to the hotel and they gave some vouchers for breakfast which it was so poor . The service at the bar on the 3rd floor is just as poor as all the staff service. They would not even offer for a drink. It was very slow. Menu is bad, food quality is bad and poor. The room is really nothing special, the room service is poor as all the staff service ( did I say that again?) they just made bed and changed towels but it was clear they would not even clean the floor. We asked a couple of things for room service like a sewing kit and a small fridge for our own drinks as the one of the room could not be used due to electronic inventory and they would just not understand what we asked for. They sent water instead sewing kit and sent someone to take out the room fridge instead installing one for us. I understand probably the credit card not working it is beyond their hands as I am myself a customer service agent and I have to deal with this everyday but it is the way they handle things. They are totally careless they would not even look for an option to solve things and all out suggestions were refused. They gave the impression to have enough guests and not wanting to waste energy in keeping more customers. They made me feel unwanted there. I know I am not their gold customer as my bf is but they dont even treat me as any average guest would deserve to be treated.

We rented 2 rooms - one for my husband/son and one for myself/my daughter. The beds were luxurious and unbelievably comfortable. We rose in the morning and walked all over Manhattan for hours and when we'd get back to the hotel, I'd take a shower in the pristene bathroom and crawl into the cool sheets - it truly was paradise. We kept the room cool - it was very hot outside and we were so lucky with 5 continuous days of sunshine. We visited Century 21 (shopping plaza) next door to the hotel. Very very busy with lots of shoppes - quite understandable as the deals on designer clothing/items was very good. My kids love labels (Lacose, Tommy Hilfiger, Dolce & Gabanna) and it was affordable at Century 21. We visited Macy's and some really cool boutiques that were so reasonable (my daughter bought 2 pairs of gorgeous jeans - $19 for each pair). These jeans at home (Canada) would have been $49+. There were outdoor restaurants/cafes and the prices were very reasonable and the food was good. We walked to Staten Island, down by the water where we could see the Brooklyn Bridge - it was a dream come true to see all of the sites we only enjoyed on t.v. It was so exciting to see New York City \"in person.\" We purchased tickets for the Broadway play \"Rock of Ages.\" Everyone in the family enjoyed it immensely. We felt so happy afterwards. (Anne Hathaway was in the audience!). Time Square was beautiful and busy - but surprisingly not as busy as I thought it would be. We visited the Madame Tussauds wax museum. I went crazy when I saw \"Jon Bon Jovi.\" We visited Ripley's Believe it or Not. That was very enjoyable too! Although I'm afraid of my own shadow, we decided to take a helicopter tour of the City. It was beyond exciting and we were so happy we did it. (Although about a month after we arrived home, there was the terrible helicopter/plane crash over the Hudson) just where we had been.

Price-wise it won't get any better considering we had a view facing Brooklyn from the 42nd floor which was, I have to confess, simply amazing. The hotel itself is, as you would expect in New York, very busy and obviously has a huge turnover which makes. The entrance hall feels more like the Grand Central at times and therefore the staff can't be as attentive as you might hope for. Besides a domestic fight between a couple next door (which isn't the hotels fault) at 3am did we have a quiet stay even to there are construction works going on day and night on ground zero. So you better make sure not to have a room facing the wrong side. All in all enjoyable stay but too buzzling for me and busy as I would like to relax once back in the hotel.

My husband was kinda cranky about that - he says that there's no benefit to better coffee if you're limited to one cup per person per day. On the other hand, I honestly think our housekeeper was the best I've ever encountered.

There are rooms on each end of the hotel that face the opposite direction and they are quieter (although the view isn't nearly as interesting). These rooms are also significantly bigger than the typical rooms facing the WTC site. I've stayed in four of these end rooms, and it seems to be hit or miss if you get one. I've attached some pictures of one of these bigger rooms, so for the standard room, imagine something much narrower. The staff is courteous and professional.

Being Gold HHonors members, we have used points to stay in most of the Hilton properties in NYC. We chose this hotel with the hopes of being able to see the fireworks from our room. We weren't disappointed. Using our points and reserving on line, I was offered the opportunity to select to an upgrade. I chose all upgrades and at check-in we got a King Jr. Suite with a city view. It cost an extra $49/N which was a bargain for the view! We were on the 34th floor, (room 3411)a 2 room suite with a first room with a sofa, lounge chair, desk, honor bar and a flat screen TV then the bathroom (great water pressure!!) and a nice size bedroom with king bed and large flat screen TV. The best part was the floor to ceiling windows with a spectacular viewsof the Hudson River, Empire State Building and the WTC site. This was a corner room, so views really spanned from the Hudson on one side to the Brooklyn Bridge on the other. We were able to see both the Macy's fireworks and those at Liberty State Park. It was such a clear night that we could even see fireworks in the distance all around NJ and LI. The hotel is located downtown and if you are looking for nightlife closeby, you would probably prefer the midtown area; however, if you want to be close to everything (many subway lines within walking distance, 2 within a block) and like the peace and quiet, then this is a great choice. In my opinion, you will not get a better value in NYC. This is a lovely hotel in a very safe neighborhood. We were given the choice of free breakfast, free internet or 1000 points as Gold members. We chose the breakfast, which was adequate for a continental breakfast. (Yes, as previously mentioned they charge $24 for the buffet which is high, but perhaps not for NYC.) They also had an option to upgrade to a 'real' breakfast for $6.50. With all the great food options in NYC, we only wanted a bit of breakfast so never bothered with more than the buffet. We looked at the fitness room and pool, but never had time to use them. They looked nice and clean. All the staff we encountered was very pleasant and helpful. We highly recommend this hotel and will definitely be back. P.S. - Century 21 department store is next door. It is a must experience if you like shopping for bargains!

The bed was very comfortable, a little disappointed that even in a junior suite the shower & bath were combined. The view over the city was nice but if you looked down it was Ground Zero and very depressing. Even more so the numbers of tourists who come each day to stare and take photos quite macabre. Food and drink is very expensive in New York but Church & Dey restaurant was quite good and compared well for value to other restaurants in the area eg; The Palm Restaurant in nearby Tribeca is nothing special yet expect to pay (before taxes etc) Steak $45 and $10-$15 for each side order. Biddy Earlys Irish pub is neither authentic nor friendly. I was born quite close to where Biddy Early, the wise woman from Co Clare lived so I was very excited to experience some Irish hospitality. I have never seen black/white pudding like the burnt offerings we received, there are no facilities to make tea and the coffee was cold. Not very friendly either and we were the only patrons there. The kitchen seem to be run by what appeared to be South American staff, so not terribly authentic. The Hotel is ideally situated for the subway which connects with the sky train for JFK. Daily unlimited tickets for the subway cost just $7.50 or $25 for 5 days. The shuttle from JFK costs $19 but took one and half hours.

The bed was VERY comfortable, and the room and bathroom were exceptionally clean. The hideabed our girls (13 and 11), shared was a bit small (full-sized) and the mattress was a little saggy, but for their size it didn't matter. Having two large flat-screened TVs was a nice plus.

Before I continue on with this review, I\u2019d just like to let my fellow travellers know that I\u2019ve stayed in New York before, so check out my other reviews for a comparison, if you liked this one. My friend and I booked a five night stay at the Millennium Hilton. We arrived at the hotel on the 21st of December 2007 and planned to stay there through Christmas. The hotel was nicely decorated and the location of the hotel is an ideal spot for those wishing to stay in this city during this busy time. Midtown and Times Square were both chaotic at almost every hour of the day. Even after midnight, the streets in Midtown were filled neck to neck with people. I liked the fact that the downtown area of Manhattan wasn\u2019t so hectic and crazy and if you can imagine how Times Square can be when it is busy, picture Midtown and Fifth Ave just flooded with pedestrians in every usable inch of sidewalk space. If you choose the Millennium Hilton, you can avoid this mad rush as you leave the hotel and when you come back to it at the end of the day. It is nice to be able to breathe and see a more relaxed side of New York and if this appeals to you than I\u2019d definitely recommend this hotel or any other hotel in this area of the city. The room we were given was on the 54th floor of the hotel (there are 55 floors in total). Since our room was not ready at check-in, we were given a complimentary upgrade to this higher city view room. The views of Ground Zero and the surrounding area were impressive and you could even see the Statue of Liberty in the distance. Due to the location of this hotel, you might expect construction noise at all hours of the night, but luckily for us, it seemed that construction wasn\u2019t in full swing during the Christmas holiday. I believe the hotel has lowered their rates to reflect the disadvantage it faces with the construction nearby, and we got a fantastic rate for our room for booking it in advance. The room itself was above average in size for this city. There was a large king sized bed, floor to ceiling windows, large closet, and a comfy chair. It was an all around comfortable space for us. The room also had things like an umbrella, safe, fridge (filled with Hilton items only, which are on a sensor, so they cannot be removed), snacks, pay-movies, and Crabtree and Evelyn bathroom amenities. These bathroom products were nice and were replaced once they were taken out of their basket, not once they were completely empty. I appreciated that the Hilton changed our bedding and towels when needed and that the room was cleaned to a high standard each day. I had no issues with our room or housekeeping and definitely feel that standards for quality are high at this Hilton hotel. The hotel has an indoor heated swimming pool, sauna, massage room, lobby bar, restaurant, fitness centre, and more. It is conveniently located next to several subway stations, which is great for those who would like to save time and money, as traveling by taxi can get quite expensive. From Newark airport, I simply hopped on the air train (free) to catch a train to Penn Station in Jersey (7.75), and from here it was easy and cheap to hop on the Path train into New York (1.50). One of the reasons I enjoyed staying at this hotel so much was that I was able to travel so cheaply to and from the airport and the final Path train stop is located right at Ground Zero, which means the Millennium Hilton is literally at it\u2019s doorstop. For this reason alone, I would definitely consider staying at the Millennium Hilton again. The restaurant in this hotel is good, but nothing special. I would recommend eating here if you want a decent meal, but don\u2019t expect to be blown away. It ranks better than most of the hotel restaurants I\u2019ve eaten at, but it is also much more expensive. Entr\u00e9e\u2019s here average $19-25, which is a little pricey but if you\u2019re pressed for time, it will do the job, I just wouldn\u2019t bank on eating here every day. They offer two breakfast buffet options: one is $17.95 and gives you access to juice, coffee, pastries, and cold breakfast items; however, for 21.95 you can also have hot breakfast food. We tried it once and thought it was quite good, and the selection of both hot and cold items was quite large. Some of the hot buffet breakfast items included: sausages, bacon, scrambled eggs, hash, hash browns, French toast, waffles, and a few other items. In my opinion, it is worth trying once during your trip. Lastly, I'd like to note that this hotel has full sized bathrooms. I know that this is very important to some travellers, so I wanted to point it out. You'll have a large counter to store and place all of your toiletries, etc. It's also a very bright room. This is in stark contrast to most of the bathrooms located in the Grand Hyatt New York. Issues: We only had one problem during our stay at this hotel and it was regarding the disgusting service we received in the lobby bar. The main bartender there is extremely rude and should be fired. I won\u2019t go into details here about the problem, but it was serious in nature and it happened on Christmas eve, of all nights. I will take a moment to thank the director of food and beverages at this Hilton property for resolving the issue for us. He was able to compensate us for the incident that happened and as a result, we definitely will be returning to this property in the future. I would, however, never, ever order a drink from the lobby bar. The director of food and beverages is committed to making sure every guest feels welcome at this hotel. Service at the hotel restaurant was also somewhat lackluster, and we often had to raise our hands or get out of our seats to signal the staff to refill our orange juice glasses. The food was above average, and no one was rude to us there, it's just that the service was lacking. Update: Well, I\u2019m posting this review a year late, but better late than never. I\u2019ve decided to return to New York for Christmas 09, with a small group of friends, and we\u2019ve decided to stay once again at the Millennium Hilton for part of our future trip. We\u2019ll stay at another property as well (mostly to cut-down on costs), but we couldn\u2019t resist booking with the Millennium Hilton for the following reasons: convenient restaurant inside hotel (which is important for a stay over Christmas day!), indoor heated swimming pool, location, price of room, view from rooms, cleanliness, etc.", "Date": "January 21, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Reading, UK", "Title": "\u201cLike a big, tall boutique hotel (on steroids.)\u201d", "Author": "talibragg", "ReviewID": "UR23763639", "Content": "I cannot wait to stay in this hotel again.

Try 'Mocca' a few hundred yards up Church St for something to eat...reasonably priced good food ,and 'Biddy Earlys' Irish Pub on Murray St(off Church St - 5 mins walk from hotel) for a cheap beer, $8 for a pitcher of 'Coors'.

There were several subway stations very close to the hotel. The hotel met and exceeded our expectations for a NYC hotel.

Its just around the corner from Wall street, and easy access to the metro. Walking distance to SoHo and Chinatown/Little Italy. The fitness- and pool area is supposedly very good, but did not have the time. A quite good hotel with a marvelous view. Location 6/10: At the bottom of Manhattan with easy access to Wall Street and boats to either Statue of Liberty or New Jersey. Its between two metro stations. Walking distance to SoHo, Chinatown and Little Italy and its shopping, restaurants, etc.. It\u2019s a drive with taxi if you want to go too mid Manhattan or Times Squre. Lobby/Check-in 6/10: Small and average lobby, nothing special. The man check us in was not service minded, but just did his job, nothing more. Elevators were super fast, which was fun. Room 7/10: We asked for, and was upgraded, to a corner room with Brooklyn view. So we had a marvelous view from the 50th floor (5009), with the Statue of Liberty and the WTC work area from one window and Brooklyn and Brooklyn Bridge towards the other. It was quite breathtaking to be in bed and see this view. The room was not big, but enough. It fitted a large king size bed, a chair with ottoman and a desk.

We immediately called Guest Services and they advised they would send an engineer and house keeping up immediately to rectify the issues. We then went out of the room for a few hours to go explore. When we came back the bed was in exactly the same condition as we left it and the refrigerator still would not open. We called back down and they replied, \"Oh, house keeping said they already changed the sheets.\" This was, however, was a complete lie because we had moved pillows and the sheets around and they were untouched.

The next morning when we took a shower, there were long and nasty hairs all in the tub and on the tile wall of the shower. We hadn't noticed it the day before because we hadn't used the shower.

I've always found it easy to get around town using the hotel as the starting location. The nightlife round the hotel is non-existent, so you should budget for a $20 cab ride back at night -- or just take a subway back for $2. The rooms are very large and the furnishings, as with any Hilton, are excellent. Huge, comfy king beds that you can disappear into, a few chairs and tables arranged around the room, and well-sized bathrooms that are always clean. One of the biggest draws for me is the swimming pool at the hotel, which is a real treat. It's never too crowded and it's a pleasant way to unwind. There's also a sauna -- though the heat is only slightly above room temperature, so I guess it's more of a lukewarm paneled room -- fitness center and a decent business center that I've used a few times.

We got a room on the 24th floor and didn't hear any bothersome noise. Yes, you could hear a \"ping\" every once in a while but during my stay through Monday I was never awaken or bothered by any of the noise. There was no construction Saturday or Sunday nights past midnight while I was there. The room itself was exactly what I expected based on pics from other users. The view was the same as seen in other pics as well. Our room was located very close to the elevators and if anything - that would have been the one thing I should have changed. I don't enjoy hearing that noise all night - loud people getting off of the elevator before quieting down because they realize they're not outside anymore. The room was very clean and tidy. The tv was a little quirky in my room. We couldn't just press Power on the remote control and have it turn on. We had to press Power then go to the tv and press the source button. I saw a post on here that complained about there not being any HD channels and thought that was just picky - BUT - the output on the tv was worse than what I'm used to from my regular non-HD digital cable. It was pretty fuzzy on most channels but we spent most of our time away from our room so we didn't really care! You don't go to NYC to watch TV!! Another problem with our room was the toilet - it didn't just FLUSH. We had to hold the handle down for the water to properly go down. The bathroom otherwise was clean...they have Crabtree and Evelyn products for your use but I didn't like the smell of them - too strong for me. I liked the showerhead but didn't feel good about the bathroom faucet because it didn't have any type of aeration-SO much water was being used every time it was turned on. The down pillows and comforter were 100% comfortable-loved them! Overall I enjoyed my time here from the prompt check in to claiming my bags from storage at check out. I enjoyed the location because it was near everything downtown that I didn't get to see the last time I was in NYC. The subway is really close by and a half block walk away.

The better bet in the evening is to take the subway north to Union Square, Times Square, etc., where there are more options. In the morning, you will see the Wall Street workers streaming from the subway like lemmings, all headed the same way. The gym appeared decent, with various machines. I did not eat in the building. Overall, this hotel is ideal for a businessperson who will be doing business in the Wall Street area. Though it is out of the way for most tourism, the subway makes everything proximal in NYC. This area is a bit far from airports. You could take the A train from Kennedy and be very close by. From LaGuardia, you would ideally take the E train, but you have to get to the train stop by taxi ($15) or bus. From Newark, you would need to go to Penn Station, then a subway south.", "Date": "June 24, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "sydney", "Title": "\u201cYou can do better\u201d", "Author": "teepeesydney", "ReviewID": "UR16889941", "Content": "Had 2 rooms for 6 nights.

The construction going on at the WTC site makes getting to the hotel a little bit of a challenge, but the signs they've put up are fairly clear. We dropped off the car in the garage, where the garage attendant stood by watching as we unpacked our bags ourselves, without offering to help. Granted, the garage isn't owned or run by the hotel, but for a hotel of this caliper, it was surprising that they didn't have bell staff there to assist visitors. Check in was a snap, and a quick one at that. The woman who helped us was very pleasant, as was the one who answered questions we had later in the afternoon. Our room, on the 41st floor overlooking the WTC site, was very nice. Although we'd been warned about possible construction noise, from that height we didn't have any at all. The room was extremely quiet during our whole stay. My only complaint about the room was that the A/C didn't work well at all. It wasn't hot out by any means, but even with the thermostat set at 65 (the lowest it would go) we were all way too warm all night long. Had we stayed longer we would have asked to have our room changed. The pool was lovely, and the public areas of the hotel were very well maintained. Aside from the A/C issues in our room, the only other area where the hotel was disappointing was in the area of the staff. Granted, we usually stay at the Sofitel in midtown, where the staff are incredibly professional and courteous. But when you're spending almost $400 for a hotel room, you expect exemplary service, and the Millenium Hilton was definitely a let-down in that area. With the exception of the front desk staff, the employees we ran into were OK at best. Not outright rude, but definitely lacking the polish and professionalism I'd expect at a hotel like this.

There is even a rescued flag framed in the reception area from the building that was salvaged on the terrible attacks in September 2001. Make sure that you ask for a front facing room as the views are simply stunning. The views from the rear will encompass Brooklyn Bridge. We didnt get chance to use the swimming pool facility but did enjoy the breakfast everyday which had the most delicious muffins I have tasted . . . ever! and you can eat as many as you want :) Nearby there is a underground station which is accessible to most places with ease, the hotel is situated just a short walk to the harbour front where you can see the Statue of Liberty. There are several restaurants nearby but dont make the mistake of ordering a starter as you wont eat the main . . . food was fab, but there was just too much of it - even for a strapping 6ft 5 lad like me. The staff in the hotel were all very friendly and nothing was too much trouble, when I ordered Champagne to the room it was there within minutes and there was never any fuss. If you are a shopaholic be sure to check out the Department Store next to the hotel 'Century 21' I think the name was - loads of bargains to be grabbed, fantastic prices and lots of choice. The hotel was also a short walk from Wall Street as it is situated in the heart of the financial district so there tends to be an after-work crowd in the hotel bar at night and that is where you can really soak up the atmosphere and mingle with the locals. Overall a thoroughly enjoyable trip - lovely hotel - the only thing I wouldnt recommend is spending New Years Eve in Times Square, although its nice to say you have done it you cant see much and you need to start queuing at 3 - 4pm in the afternoon in the freezing cold . . and if you need the toilet, well you lose your place!

I always wait a month to write a review, incase I had a bad experience. Most people don't. It's easiest to blame the hotel. I'm there every month and try to stay in a different location. This hotel is a hop on the subway to everything. Subway is right across the street. It's right next to Century 21. My Favorite store. The view from our room was amazing. We could see every part of Ground Zero. It was important for me to have my son see the devastion that was caused. Everything was amazing: the bedding, cleanliness, staff, location, all of it. With the exception of the conceierge. He would rather help the business men, then a lady & her teenage son. Don't worry about the construction noise.

Booked directly through Hilton by phone. Easy 7-10 minute taxi ride from Penn Station, or there is a subway stop next to the hotel. This hotel is directly across the street from the Path Station and Ground Zero. Also, across the side street from St. Paul's Church (built in 1766. This church was where George Washington went to pray after his inauguration. It is also the church who's amazing stained glass windows didn't even crack as the towers-across the street-collpased. It was a relief/aide station during the months following the attacks. There is also an old cemetary in front dating back to the Revolutionary War). Trinity Church, South Street Seaport & Museum, Battery Park, Tribecca, City Hall, Chinatown, etc. are also nearby. My 8 year old daughter and I had a Corner King on the 37th floor. I have to say, from check in to check out, we were both treated with great respect and courtousy. We were offered ear plugs or a sound machine if the noise from ground zero became too loud. We didn't need either of these things; however, there was a pounding noise from the site which ended at midnight and began again at 6 am. (just in time for us to see the awsome sun rise over the statue of liberty!) The view from our room was amazing. The windows are almost floor to ceiling. Out one window we could see the Brooklyn Bridge and Dumbo. Out the other window we could see Ellis Island and the Statue of Liberty. We watched the ferries go by and the circle line, as well as some cruise ships on their way back home. The beds were very comfortable. The room had a large flat screen plasma TV, alarm clock radio, two phones (one in the bathroom), a Lavazza Coffee Maker with tea set up as well, and internet access (for a fee). There is not fan in the bathroom but it was very nice and the name brand toiletries were top qualitiy. The ceiling in this room was large by current standards. Don't open the minibar unless you want something...it is on sensors and if you touch it the computer thinks you bought it. One wonderful thing that this hotel has that many others in Manhattan don't, is a pool. It is located on the 5th floor next to the fitness room and the spa (where you can opt for a massage after walking around downtown all day!) The decor of the restaurant and bar area were modern but not large. Windows overlook ground zero on one side and St. Paul's Church on the other. My daughter liked watching the cars and people go by outside below us while we ate dinner. She was waving at people who actually waved back at her. That made her day. Be advised that they do have a children's menu but they do not offer substitutions. Also, if you don't want your burger rare, say so! The menu had a lot to choose from. Something for almost all tastes. I would definately stay here again if I needed to be downtown. The reception was wonderful, room beautiful, pool fun and food good. There is also a starbucks downstairs and a real hot dog vendor around the corner. There is a lot to do downtown so take advantage of this wonderful area of Manhattan.

This hotel has a super location downtown - you are next door to Century 21 only a few minutes walk to Battery Park (and the Liberty/Ellis Island ferries) a few minutes to South Street Seaport and the subway is right at the hotel door for midtown and uptown trains. My only criticism - and I stress only, is the concierge arranging transfers back to the airport - ours was a yellow cab with no meter running so the journey back to the airport cost far more than the journey from the airport.

The hotel is out of the hustle and bustle of the main attractions such as Times Square so the traffic & pedestrian noise levels are non-existent from the hotel rooms. We were welcomed by very polite and cheerful hotel staff and found our room to have an incredible view over Ground Zero on Floor 53 (of 54) ... we could also see the Statue of Liberty from our room - east facing rooms look over the East River towards the Brooklyn, Manhattan and Williamsburg Bridges. Construction of the Freedom Tower which is to stand in the place of the former Twin Towers is to be ready in 2010. Although friends who had visited several weeks before us had told us that construction noise could only be heard from 8am to 9pm we found this to be different on our visit. Extended hours are being worked in order that the Freedom Tower is finished on time. We could hear construction noise (even on the 53rd floor) from 5:30am to 11:30pm. A letter of apology from the hotel management was on our room desk the following day and to be honest the noise was not really a problem so do not be put off - just be aware of it if you are travelling here. We bought the \"hop on hop off\" bus pass (All Loops Tour) but only used it once as the subway and the taxis were very cheap and easy to use. Also the top of an open-top bus in December is VERY cold so you don't want to spend too much time up there! The subway station starts and ends directly opposite the hotel. The fare is $2 per person per trip and this will get you to 42nd Street (A, C and E Trains) and a block away from Times Square and all it's entertainment & shopping in less than 15 minutes. Don't take with you any preconceived ideas about the subway - it is cheap, clean, roomy, quick and VERY safe. We will use this method of transport around New York on every future trip now. The hotel concierge are superb so make sure you use them and their vast knowledge of the area. We were advised on transport, restaurants, bars, shopping and local sites. If you stay at the Hilton Millenium you MUST go into St Paul's Chapel next door where memorials and tributes are made to those brave people who lost their lives and loved ones in the 9/11 attacks. It is a very humbling, moving and peaceful place - we were very touched by this experience and were priveleged to have spent time here. There is a GREAT deli around the corner on Vesey Street. Breakfast and lunch are delicious and very cheap. Try the hot pastrami with mustard & pickle on rye - simply delicious. Please look at the photographs on the walls in the deli too - again some very moving pictures taken from 9/11 in the deli sheltering fire and police crews - very thought provoking. You can also find a superb French restaurant on the east side of the hotel - from memory I think it was on John Street but I can't remember the restaurant name - you'll know it when you see it. We had a bottle of wine and butcher's cut steaks which were divine all for $80 - quality! In summary the Hilton Millenium is outstanding. Rooms are very comfortable, clean and have all the requirements expected from visitors including entertainment system (huge Plasma TV / Playstation / WiFi / Tea & Coffee / Ice / Mini-Bar, etc.). Room service was superb & delicious as well as very reasonably priced for a hotel. I have read many reviews on this site and find it a little fickle that people mark this hotel down because they see Ground Zero as a construction site or that they were kept awake by people arguing in the hallway - this is no contribution to the rating of this hotel. We rate the hotel as very highly recommended. We would definitely stay here again without hesitation and hope that our review helps you make your decison as to where to stay in this wonderful city!

Big Tip: Don't use the inroom fridges to store your own leftovers. We removed soda cans from the top shelf to put our take-away food in, and upon check out we were billed over $100 for \"amenities.\" Apparently there is a sensor in the fridge that automatically charges the room when it feels weight being moved. The front desk cleared up the false charges quickly, but I wish we had some warning. Oh yes, and they do not have wireless internet available at the hotel. They have internet plugs at a charge of $12.95/day. All in all it was a great place to stay for our first night in NY.

The photos on the website looked very nice and the value for money was good given our 5 night stay included New Years Eve. I had no doubts really that the hotel would be fine given the Hilton name. The hotel itself is very nice, clean and with stylish decor and first impressions are very good. Ours problems however started at check in. I had pre-booked a king room with a city view only to be told there were none currently available, so we had 2 choices, wait for a room to become available later in the afternoon (it was 4pm when we tried to check in) or take a lower room. We decided to wait for our room with a view that we wanted. We were pretty tired after the very long journey but sat patiently in the hotel bar for our room. After an hour we went back to the desk and were allocated our room on the 48th floor. The room was very nice with a view right over what was the WTC and the Statue of Liberty in the distance. I was perfectly aware that there was construction works going on prior to booking the hotel but presumed the works would stop in the evening and continue in the morning and as I am someone who sleeps well I did not think it would pose a problem \u2013 how wrong could I be? I decided to have a quick kip before heading out for something to eat on the 1st evening, I laid on the bed for 2 hours between 5 and 7 and didn\u2019t sleep a wink due to the very loud construction noises. On our way out for something to eat we asked at reception what time the works would stop, we were told maybe 11pm sometimes earlier sometimes later (not very helpful) we asked for some ear plugs which they appeared to have plenty of. The long and short of it is that the construction went on ALL night and we did not sleep a wink, even with the ear plugs and a pillow on my head. We phoned down to reception in the morning and asked to be moved to a quieter room or alternatively to relocate us to another hotel and we had no intention of staying where we were and having 5 sleepless nights. We took our luggage down to reception and went out for the day. We were told we would be allocated another room. We returned to the hotel at 8pm to find we had not yet been allocated a room, after about \u00bd an hour they found us a new room. It had twin beds and no city view but the room was quiet and we were too tired to argue the difference and the receptionists did not seem too bothered anyway. I intend to take this further with Hilton now we have returned home. On the positive side as before the actual hotel is very nice. Ideally located for down town Manhattan with subways on the doorstep costing $2 for a single journey anywhere in Manhattan. New York is a fantastic place, everything you think it will be and a place you have to visit at least once. The shopping is amazing and very cheap in comparison to the UK, there are many bargains to be had. The food is also fantastic, we ate in Fish in Greenwich Village and had whole lobster for \u00a315. New York at this time of year was very very busy, I would definitely return again although probably at a quieter time of year. If you go when its busy expect to queue for everything.

Yes there was some noise, but nothing that you may even notice. We didn't eat at the restaurant but we heard that it was very good. They have a great pool, and fitness center. The business center had all the amenities , but charged for use of the internet, (perhaps in my opinion the only negative thing about the hotel).

There is only a very small bar in the lobby and one restaurant on the 3rd floor (which did a satisfactory but not stunning buffet). There is a fitness centre but I did not get to it on this trip. The hotel is right next to the famous Century 21 discount label department store and an easy 10 minute walk to South Street Sea Port area with its shops and museums and the major drop off and pick up for the round Manhattan bus tours.

Go to the Stage Door Deli across the way for great breakfasts and real theatre courtesy of the staff. Have you ever seen a bagel fly? Well, you can here. We also ate in the Woolworth Building Kitchen which was excellent value. The hotel's restaurant serves up similar fare but is more expensive and less atmospheric than either of these. Being right next door to Century 21 is another plus \u2013 even if only for getting in early morning or late evening before it gets far too busy.

Well, thank goodness as any precocious 17 year old would, she wanted to spend the extra for a good hotel. So I chose the Millenium Hilton from the City & Show website, and actually got a pretty good deal. As it turned out, my daughter was EXTREMELY ill for the trip, for all of the 5 days we spent there. It started when she fainted on the plane out there (a BIG BIG thank you to the wonderful guys on Continental Airlines who helped her out with oxygen). So we got to Newark, got our taxi to the hotel, and my daughter didn't leave after that (except for an hour in Bloomingdales and a pre-booked helicopter trip). She couldn't walk one block so didn't even see Ground Zero. So we were stuck in our fantastic hotel room on the 44th floor, with our excellent view up towards the Empire State. As a busy working mum, I actually found the enforced stay very relaxing - we caught up on all of our movies on the big flat screen! The staff was very helpful, and the beds extremely comfortable. This hotel made what could have been an utterly miserable trip, bearable. I had a meal in the restaurant one evening which was very pleasant. Also, the hotel is right next to Century 21, which is ideal for cut-price shopping. And the World Financial Centre is also worth a look, as well as the church across the road which at that time still held the memorabilia for the lost loved ones of the 9/11 tragedy. The only problem (and why I'm not giving it a 5 rating) is that there were no instructions by the phone on how to ring an international call back home to Ireland, and I inadvertently dialled various numbers (including to Africa apparently!) and I had to work hard with the reception staff not to be charged an exorbitant amount.

Upon arrival, reception was very busy, and we were a little dissapointed by the staff, who were perfectly professional and efficient, but as a result - not overly friendly. That aside, the service was excellent, if not with a smile. The room was a comfortable size, with full length ceiling to floor windows on one side, a wide screen tv with cable and plenty of storage as well as a lovely bathroom. We had a room on the 29th floor (I think) which had spectacular views overlooking the ground zero site. One of the first things we did was go and visit the site, an emotional experience, having wached those awful events live on the news all day when they unfolded. We were only in the city for a few days, over the New Year period, and found the hotel an excellent home from home after travelling around the city seeing the sights. Century 21 is right next door and full of great bargains, and as soon as you get used to the subway system, the city is very easy to navigate from here. We walked to Wall Street, and over to the Statton Island ferry port (were you get the ferry to go to the Statue of Liberty) as well. This was not a 5 minute walk, more like 20 - 30, but enjoyable, even in December. New Year's eve was a greatly anticipated event for us, and we chose to do it the traditional NY way and go to Time Sq. We had received advice to get there very early, and we thought 6pm would be early enough. Boy we were wrong. We finally made it into a pen about 10 blocks back from Time Sq, where we were unable to get out for food, drink or toilet breaks. We stood for 6 hours with little idea of what was happening in the centre, and by the time the ball dropped, we were ready to drop ourselves! The party atmosphere was a little jaded by this point, but we still cheered, hugged the poeple we'd met in the crowd, and then my husband proposed. This made it all a lot more bearable, of course! If I was to recommend a NY New Year to anyone, I would say they should book into a hotel off Time Sq, or book at a restaurant nearby, as this will make for a much more pleasant experience! If not, you probably need to arrive at about mid day to get a spot in the centre, which I'm sure would be worthwhile. All was made more wonderful when we returned to the hotel, hungry and cold to find that NY truly is the city that never sleeps. Through room service we were able to order a pizza from the parlour down the road. It was delivered to our room at about 1 am and must have been the best pizza I have ever eaten!

Each room has a 42\u201d plasma TV but I did not see any HD tv channels so you can\u2019t really take advantage of it. There is a small bar fridge but you can\u2019t use it because it is full of their items and if you move anything the electronic sensors will bill you. There was a ice container we would fill up to keep our leftover cheesecake good until the next day. Elevators were crazy fast, we were on the 50th floor and never had to wait longer than 20 seconds for an elevator and the full trip was under 30 seconds. Pool and fitness room were quite reasonable. Check in time is 3pm but we there is quite a rush at that time. We arrived at 11am and simply dropped off our luggage and pre-reserved a room (ask for one on the side away from Church St. for lovely views on the Brooklyn st bridge and to avoid the near 24 hr construction at the WTC site. Parking is super expensive at the hotel so we just dropped off our luggage and parked at a parking lot under the FDR drive by the Brooklyn Bridge (take Frankfort St toward South St) and you can\u2019t miss it. $21/day taxes included for parking in a fully insured and monitored car lot. Location/Activities: The hotel is on Church street in SOHO Financial district right across from the big hole in the ground that was the world trade center. Metro entrances 2 min walk from the hotel but another 5-6 min underground to get to the line. ~15-20 min by metro to Times Square and other great areas. 10 min walk to the Staten Island ferry which is a faster and cheaper (free) to take a boat past the statue of Liberty. The financial district is much quieter at night than midtown but my wife and I never felt unsafe walking the streets to the hotel at midnight after a broadway show. There are cheap ways to eat in the area. Our favorite nearby was a 24hr buffet ($5.74/lb of food) at about Fulton St and William St. Also a nice bistro and grocery store at about Liberty St and William St. We brought our own cereal and bowls and simply bought a liter of milk from the pharmacy on Fulton just east of Broadway each morning on our way to the TKTS booth for a super cheap breakfast. The TKTS booth is at the corner of John St and Front St about 10 min walk from the hotel. This TKTS booth opens at 11am for that evenings and the next days matinees shows. Be aware that the tickets are pretty much all $60 for Broadway shows (they only really discount the most expensive seats) and they tend not to have the most popular shows (Hairspray, Rent, Legally Blond, Mary Poppins, ect.). Also note there are really no Broadway shows on Sunday nights. We did however see Chorus line, Curtains, Phantom of the Opera and The Drowsy Chaperone. The TKTS booth in Times square sells that days matinees and evening shows and tends to have a better selection but longer lines. It also opens later (2pm) so it wrecks your day more. Food before broadway shows can be had cheaply on Eighth ave between 44th \u2013 45 th st (Subway, burger and pizza joints, ect) but I highly recommend \u201cJuniors\u201d on 45th St just west of Broadway. $10 sandwiches and burgers and the best cheesecake in the world ($6.50) \u2013 I recommend the devils foodcake or the chocolate mousse cheesecake.

Though I arrived several hours before check-in I was given a room right away with an absolutely breathtaking view on the 47th floor. I booked a special weekend rate through Travelzoo for $211/night. This is easily THE BEST hotel I've stayed in while in NYC and I've stayed in several hotels in the city. The staff was extremely kind and accommodating, especially the bellmen who had kind greetings for everyone walking through the door. I especially liked the turndown service they had every evening with chocolates, fresh bottled water and a bucket of ice. The only things I did not like about the Hotel Millenium was the room service food was incredibly expensive, but not good at all (I ordered the combination appetizer platter and the food tasted like it was microwaved and not freshly cooked). The mini bar prices are also ridiculous, similar to many high end hotels in the city. Finally, I think the hotel needs to have wireless internet for all customers. This is the first Hilton I've stayed at where wireless internet was NOT available in the room (only in public spaces), nor was the internet free for Hilton Honors members, though it was a relatively reasonable price of $5.95/24 hours (I've seen much worse).

Pros: Room was plenty big enough, air conditioner worked fine and offered range of temps, bed was comfortable and the curtains let the room get pretty dark. We had a high floor so noise wasn't really an issue. Elevators were fast and you never had to wait for more than a couple seconds for one to come. Plenty of cabs outside and subway right across the street. Bathroom was very big and roomy. Nice soft towels and lots of counter space. I didn't need internet access while I was there so I don't know how that service was but my cell phone reception was great throughout the hotel. I didn't use the fitness center - I ran on the streets while I was there and I ran alone and felt completely safe. I also didn't eat at the hotel so I can't comment on the food. Cons: Checkin was a little slow - they only had 2 people behind the desk and I'll never understand why hotels don't put up a queue line. Although there was an informal line of people waiting to check in, some rude guests were just walkin in and going right up to the counter in front of everyone who was waiting.

Thus, it can be noisy and the main entrance, Church Street, is often closed.

I actually liked the location as many of the subway line end up at this location. I can see that some people might not like this part of town at night as it is not hopping as other places such as Times Square. Night time was indeed less crowded than during the day time. At night, I would still see people around. Furthermore, this place is not so far from China Town and Little Italy and at night, there are lots of people in the area to eat etc. I actually liked this location lots as I have an affinity for Asian food. In addition, Century 21, an outlet shop is right next door. Hotel: Initially, I requested room with a king sized bed. They honored my request. When I got up to the room, it was a bit small. I came down and asked for an upgrade. They told me that there was no upgrade available. They gave me a corner room with a queen sized bed instead, which was way more spacious. Ask for a corner room, if you can. I did not find too many negatives to write about. The one thing that sort of irked me a bit was the hot water; it took about a minute to have hot water in the shower. The bathroom amenities were what one would expect at a hotel of this category. Toiletries were of Crabtree and Evelyn. Plenty of towels in the bathroom. There were no slippers or bathrobes, something I never really use. The bed, pillows, and sheets were all good. More importantly, there were all white. No motel styled/ flower sheets. There was a nice and big flat screen with cable channels. There was no Wifi in the room.

I find that for the price of $260/night (including tax) I paid for, it offered a really good value. The same hotel category in Midtown probably will cost twice as much, if not more.

Because I noted that the Millenium Hilton got consistently high ratings from most guests I decided to take the advice of the TripAdvisor Members and book my Memorial Weekend stay there even though it's location was quite far from where the rehearsal dinner and wedding were to take place. I am glad that I did!! The hotel and rooms are as gorgeous as the pictures in Trip Advisor and Travelocity! The location one of the quietest spots in NY. Hardly any traffic noise could be heard from my room. I don't know if it being Memorial Day weekend had anything to do with the low noise as there were workmen at the ground zero site and plenty of people in the streets but at any rate, the low noise level worked out fine for me. The hotel decor was modern and the entire facility looked very well kept. The carpeting was plush and all the brass and glass surfaces sparkled. The hotel also has its own garage for guest parking . My room was a little bit bigger in size than my home's master bedroom which I understand from some of the reviews I've read here is big by NY standards. It boasted a very large (Queen I think) and extremely comfortable bed with lots and lots of fluffy pillows and a long \"sausage\" pillow which is perfect for folks that like to wrap themselves around a pillow for support. The room and carpet were clean. There was also a large flat screenss stereo tv that was equipped with both a wireless keyboard (for internet surfing) and game controls for playing video games. The tv system would also allow the viewing and purchase of movies but I don't know the prices because I did not choose to use any of those features but I'm sure that you could run up quite a bill. There was a well stocked mini bar with beer, soda and snacks but because they're notoriously expensive I didn't dare consume any of them. There was also a dresser with two empty drawers for storing your stuff. There were two telephones. One in the bathroom and a cordless two line model next to the bed. There were two separate reading lamps on each side of the bed and a very simple to use alarm/clock radio with your choice of sounds to wake up to. There was also a writing desk that was equipped with two jacks for internet access for laptop computers. One jack was for a regular phone line modem and the second one was for DSL access. Next to the desk was a table that held an ice bucket, a wine bottle opener and glasses and an coffeemaker with cups and coffee supplies. There were also two comfy chairs, an ottoman a small table and new issues of two NY entertainment guide magazines. Next to the bed inside the night stand's drawer was a free paperback copy of Conrad HIlton's autobiography which I'm still reading. The room had it's own climate control for the a/c heat system and it worked flawlessly at keeping the room at the temperature that I set it to. There are no keys for the doors of the suites, instead you get a credit sized electronic \"key\" that unlocks the door for you. In my \"standard\" room there was also a full length mirror and plenty of lighting and seating. Two features of my room impressed me. The well appointed closet and bathroom. The well appointed closet held, a folding suitcase stand, a large umbrella with the Hilton logo and around 4 or 10 thick wooden hangers. A couple had clips for holding skirts, a couple had trouser bars and two were thickly padded ones of the type for holding evening dresses. There was also an iron and ironing board in the closet and on the top shelf your very own electronically controlled combination safe for your valuables. The bathroom was very well lit. It had a very large mirror and an illuminated magnifying makeup mirror that swiveled. There was also a hair dryer. The faux marble counter ran the entire length of the bathroom so you had lots of room for your toiletries. It also included a nicely appointed bathroom set which included facial tissue, drinking glasses and Crabtree & Evelyn toiletries (mouthwash, shampoo, hair conditioner, a shower cap, bubble bath and body lotion and bar soap) and lots and lots of fluffy towels. The shower/ tub had a swiveling shower head that you could adjust to deliver either a full stream of water or a pulsating shower massage. The water was plentiful as either ice cold or scalding hot and the water pressure was just fine. The toilet was one of the quietest flushing models I've ever heard and worked flawlessly. From my window I had a great view of ground zero and the window curtains could be adjusted to let in either a lot of light or shut it out completely. I was on the 17th floor and could hardly hear any of the traffic below. The downtown location is excellent. Hilton provided in each room a folded pocket sized map of NY city with indicators for different businesses in the immediate area as well as the locations and routes of the subway system. This little jewel of a map was my lifeline and guide during my entire stay in NYC. Meals in the hotel (like in any hotel) are expensive ($22.00 for breakfast) but there are lots of inexpensive diners in the area. Right in the next block was the \"Stage Door Deli\" (open 7 days) where I got one of the biggest and best breakfasts I've ever had (2 scrambled eggs, bacon, potatoes, toast and coffee) for only $7.00 and their sandwiches are excellent! There are also the ever present hot dog carts on almost every corner where you can get really delicious hot dogs, shishkebabs or pretzels for a very reasonable price. Next to the hotel is a large discount dept store (21st Century) so if you forgot to pack something like a shirt or tie or socks or shoes you could shop there for designer brands at discount prices. The subway was less than a 1/2 block away and easy to navigate. A one way fare is only $2.00 but you can buy a \"fun pass\" for $7.00 which gives you unlimited rides all day. However, if you choose to take a taxi to where the action is (Central Park area) I found that it will set you back around $22.00 plus tip because remember, the Millenium is waaaayyyyy downtown in the financial district. A taxi ride to the airports - I was told- can cost you as much as $55.00 plus tolls, plus tax plus tip so I chose to ride in and out of Newark Airport on the super shuttle van service which costs only $17.00 plus tax and tip. BTW you can make reservations with Super Shuttle airport van service by toll free phone or online. Their only drawback is that because the shuttle goes around picking up passengers in other hotels besides you they will require that you be ready to check out quite a few hours before your flight. For example, my flight departed at 11:00 am but their pickup time for me by the shuttle was 7:30 But, it was a reasonable trade off for the savings. And their service was really, really good. They even telephoned a \"reminder\" of my reservation to my cellphone and their cancellation policy is reasonable if your travel plans change. The Millenium Hilton hotel lobby is very nicely decorated in modern style and had a small but well appointed gift shop. They looked as good as in the pictures shown on line. The lobby also had a bar at the other end but I didn't patronize it so I can't critique it. The hotel also had a gym, a restaurant and I think that it also had a pool but I didn't check them out. Overnight shoe shine service was also available. One lobby feature that I liked was a touch screen kiosk where you could punch in your flight information and a printed boarding pass would pop out for your convenience. On the back end of the block from the hotel were a Dunkin Donuts, several small diners and a big CVS pharmacy. Around two blocks down from the hotel was a Barney's Men's clothing store (another NY institution). Chinatown and Little Italy neighborhoods were a brisk walking distance away and in those areas I encountered loud traffic and massive flocks of people spilling from the sidewalks walking cheek & jowl making me glad that I didn't pick a hotel in those areas! I wanted quiet and I got it at the Millenium. A short walk to the other side of ground zero across from the hotel and you were walking by the bay and I could see the statue of Liberty at a distance. Water taxi and sightseeing services are available in the area. I read a lot of horror stories about NY hotels trying to stick its guests with padded bills for minibar snacks that were not consumed or treating a customer poorly because they booked their room thru a discount service like travelocity but that didn't happen to me at the Millenium. When I telephoned ahead from my room to advise the front desk that I was checking out a very nice lady at the the other end told me that I had incurred no additional charges and that the prepaid travelocity bill had covered everything in my stay. All I had to do at checkout was to drop off my electronic room key at the front desk and just and walk out the door (didn't even had to sign anything) to my waiting ride never encountering any pushy doormen or bellboys. They were all very pleasant, courteous and helpful. The concierges Justin and Mark bent over backwards in giving me directions to my travel and shopping destinations and the bellhops and front desk personnel were just as attentive, pleasant and polite. There are other Hilton hotels in NY and I can't honestly say that all of them treat their guests the same way or have the same amenities but I did enjoy my stay in the big apple at the Millenium Hilton and I definitely recommend them and I would stay there again on my next visit to NYC. 5 stars!!!", "Date": "June 3, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dallas", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel\u201d", "Author": "ou_chot", "ReviewID": "UR7731506", "Content": "Stayed at this locale over Memorial Weekend.

I won a room here (4 star downtown in Priceline terms) for 200.00 per night. I used to work 2 blocks away so never really thought of staying here for a night out since it wouldnt seem like a \"get away\" necessarily but we were pleasantly surprised by our experience. The front desk was very friendly and our check in and out experience couldnt have been faster. We had a room on the 35th floor that overlooked the WTC site and the Hudson. The beds was incredibly comfortable, the tv was large and new with a good selection of channels and the bathroom was large and very clean. I do have two small negatives that I would point out. The first is that we were at the end of the hallway and there are three doors at the end of the hallway plus the staff work room so it was quite noisy with people coming and going. I could hear the noise from the hall a lot while inside the room so I ended up putting a towel under the door to try to muffle outside noise a bit. The second negative is that the mini bar refrigerator has sensors in it and so if you even move something to fit in your leftovers (as we did) they know and you will be charged for it. Luckily I saw the note that tells you this and so called to remove the charges from the bill before we left. However, if i hadnt, i would have been charged for two drinks (over 15 dollars) that we didnt take. I understand the technology makes it easy for them but future occupants should be aware of this. A note to those considering this hotel: there is very little \"late night\" activity in the area. We were going to the film festival which ended after midnight and had to cab north to find somewhere to go after the movie had ended.

I'm trying to hit several different hotels in different areas I need to be in. This time I had several meetings in the Financial District so I booked this hotel. I knew the view would be great but maybe a little strange since the World Trade Center is no longer in front of it. You see, this hotel is located right behind where the World Trade Center used to be. I fly from Buenos Aires so it's a LONG 10+ hour flight. Even flying in Business Class to JFK is no comfort and after a long flight I like to go right to the room. I arrived very early around 6:30 am. I encountered a very grumpy middle aged man that didn't even offer a \"good morning\". I gave him my name and reservation number and I also showed him my Hilton HHonors Gold VIP card. I have spent a LOT of money with Hilton hotels around the world but this didn't seem to matter to this guy. He didn't even look at it. I inquired about checking in early and he said \"no it's impossible\". He didn't say anything like \"I'm sorry Mr. X all the rooms are occupied\". Or any other explanation. He simply said that check-in is at 2 PM and that was that. It was only 6:30 am and I was exhausted since I didn't sleep on the long flight. I was going to wait in the lounge but the chairs are not comfortable and the lounge area really isn't that nice. I checked my bag and decided to go have breakfast and do some shopping. I stayed out until about 1 PM. I was a few blocks away but usually not in this area and I didn't know it well. I called the hotel to ask for directions and said \"I know I'm only a few blocks away...can you help\". The guy that answered the phone said that he couldn't help and transferred me to what I'm assuming is the concierge desk and no one answered the phone. I was furious. I asked a police officer and he kindly pointed me in the right direction. I get to the hotel and it's 2 PM now. I see there is still no one at the concierge desk. It's very rude when a guest is calling to get directions and you simply transfer it to an empty desk. It would have taken him all of 10 seconds to explain where the hotel was. So I get to the front desk and they give me my key. I go to get my checked bag and I had a big bag plus all the bags I had from shopping (and I did a LOT of shopping). The bellboy (or I should say middle aged man) just handed me my suitcase and didn't even offer to help me take it to my room. This is extremely unprofessional. So this was 3 things now all before I even got to my room that I was not happy about. Someone definitely needs to do a customer service seminar for these employees. This is not a way to treat a customer that frequents their many hotels around the world. I get to my room and my bad mood goes away once I see the view. They put me on the 49th floor and I have an amazing view! It's very very strange to see the big hole where the World Trade Center was. I snapped some photos that I don't know if they will allow me to post on Trip Advisor since it's not the hotel but of the view. The room size is extremely big for a New York City hotel. I guess for the u$s 350+/night range you get mostly small hotel rooms here in NYC but this was very spacous with a King size bed. The room had a 42'inch Plasma/LCD TV which was a great touch. I do the same thing in my properties that I have for rent and people really appreciate these things. The bathroom was a good size as well. Nothing luxurious but it was at least spacious. The bed was extremely comfortable with great pillows as well. I stayed a few nights and used the room service and each time they were very quick. I'd say the food was delivered in less than 30 minutes each time. The food quality was ok as well. The prices on the menu don't seem too expensive but then remember they add on like $4 service fee + 15% tip which is also fairly common these days. I'm here getting ready to check-out. I must have just gotten a grumpy check-in guy. I just called down to let them know that I didn't use anything in my mini-bar and there were at least 4 things on my bill. The nice guy that answered (said his name was Robert) was very friendly and explained that the refrigerators have motion sensors that detect if you take something out. I did move some things around to put in some water that I had but put them back in. I thought that was interesting and never heard of that before so make sure you check your bills at the check-out. I asked Robert if I could have a late check-out and he said \"sure, no problem. What time did you want to check-out. I told him I just needed a few extra hours. 2 PM would be fine and he said not a problem. Now that is good customer service and very friendly. He sounded younger and was much friendlier than the grumpy old guy at the check-in. All in all, I'd highly recommend this hotel. If they got rid of the grumpy ole guy at the check-in and trained their staff to be a little friendlier than I'd say it's highly recommended.

Fantastic views and the room was a very generous size, including a small lounge area with a second TV, sofa and desk. The 42\" plasma is certainly the largest screen I've seen in a hotel room but there is no inroom WiFi, just an ethernet cable connection that you pay for. You can detect over a dozen WiFi networks but you can't connect to them! The bathroom wasn't small either although the fittings looked a little dated. The bed was wide and very comfortable, with good pillows too. There's also a free safe which is always one of the main items I look for. The breakfast buffet was of a good standard but they have a la carte too. Dinner was slightly disappointing although that may have been due to my choice of dish. Costs aren't too high either. Negatives: the air-con system made a lot of noise, even when switched off. This may be a one-off and as I will probably stay here again for work, I shall update my review next time. The lack of WiFi, even if I could pay for it, was annoying, considering the typical guest is most likely a business traveller, judging by the occupants at breakfast. My final gripe is aimed at this and many other hotels; they all leave cards indicating their commitment to protecting the environment, asking you to reuse towels and save water etc. However, even if you don't leave towels in the bathtub, they still change everything every day! And it smacks of hypocrisy when they use 8 lightbulbs in the bathroom, although I did detect energy saving bulbs elsewhere in the room. The surrounding area is a bit shabby so take a taxi or the metro for your shopping and dining needs. Overall, it's a good hotel that could improve on a couple of areas but it's best suited to business travellers.

Anyway, the Financial Distric is very close to great spots like South Seaport, Soho, Lower East Side and even East and Greenwich Village.

The room was wonderful - actually two rooms, with a plasma tv, luxurious king bed with soft, quality linens and a housekeeping staff that couldn't have been more efficient.

Yes, the lobby is small and the lounge could be a bit larger, but if this is the only thing wrong - please. The location of this hotel is just fine - a subway station 100 feet from the entrance. The subways are quite safe and a great way to get around, but if you're subway-shy, taxi's are abundant all around this hotel. However, we found it difficult getting one - we were there when the weather was quite cold and they all seemed to be occupied! So the subway it was, with no problems at all. Being downtown, I agree with a previous review wholeheartedly - it is quiet down here and away from the craziness of Times Square - you couldn't pay me to stay there! My only complaint towards this hotel is the miserable, bored, unhappy, unpleasant wait staff in the restaurant. And the breakfast ...... if we had to pay for that food....something like $29/person for a breakfast buffet that was as cold as ice coming directly from the kitchen! The eggs were stone cold, as was the bacon, sausage, potatoes, etc. My advice - go somewhere else - anywhere else - for breakfast.

Because we were both exhausted and wanting to go to sleep we did not want to make an issue of it because we did not want to change rooms at that time.

Its location across from Ground Zero doesn't really help much either... For all of the compliments, we did have two complaints. First, for a quad-occupancy room, beds were very small, making for an intimate sleeping encounter whether you wanted it or not. If you want the possibility of moving around without falling out of the bed (or accidently knocking your partner out), better upgrade to a junior suite. Secondly, because of flight delays, one of our group arrived at the hotel after our party had already headed uptown.

But that's OK because the hotel is right outside the entranceway to the WTC subway stop on the E train. My wife and I arrived by bus at Penn Station (also on the E line), and a few stops later, was at the door to the Hilton. Plus, all the hotspots in Manhattan are served on the blue (A, C, E) line: Times Square, Columbus Circle/Central Park, Empire State Building, etc. Can't beat the convenience. Service was impeccable. We asked room service to send up toothpaste, and in timely fashion, a gentleman arrived at our door with the goods. A few minutes after that, we got a phone call from Housekeeping asking us if the toothpaste was delivered. Was a nice touch since this was the first time I had ever experienced a follow-up call, and I've stayed at many more upscale hotels. We got a king-size bedroom and as a previous poster noted, the window view was of the WTC construction site.

They are doing construction on Church Street, so you are forced to enter through the side entrance on Fulton Street. This particular trip we drove into NYC, and it was POURING rain. I couldn't have asked for a more helpful staff as we arrived. We had our two small children with us, so the bellman immediately came to my car and started grabbing my bags. He was so fast, I had to slow him down, so he didn't bring all the contents of my car into the hotel. It was great service. He encouraged us to get the kids inside and had my car valet parked. I had my room keys within a few minutes and my bags were taken up to my room with us. The rooms were clean and comfortable, but not huge - typical of NYC. Flat screen tv was great for the kids, but reception wasn't that spectacular for some channels. The view from the 28th floor over former WTC site is unreal, even in the rain! The lobby was small, but nice. The gift shop was the size of a closet. Once four people get in there, it gets complicated. Most importantly, all staff members I encountered at this hotel were friendly. The concierge was very helpful in recommending nearby eateries that would suit our budget, and accomodate two small kids. He knew everything from local pizzerias and delis to 5 star restaurants. The subway was right across the street, and also a block away (depending on what line you were looking for) so we were able to access all of NYC very easily. The rates at this hotel tend to be pretty high whenver I check them, but because of its location, it tends to be much less expensive on the weekends. Give it a shot! My one negative of the visit was when I picked up my car from the valet. It's a Hilton garage right behind the hotel, but it's operated by a parking lot company. You have to call a number from your room to tell them you want your car, as it takes up to 1/2 hour for them to get your car. We were never told of that, until after the bellman came up to get our bags. We were told to wait in the lobby and ended up doing so for quite some time. Then our car was brought out and nobody told us it was ready. It was pretty confusing.

The facilities are excellent, but serious guest service problems keep this hotel from reaching its full potential. It is very unfortunate that such a lovely facility is held back by repeated gaffes on the part of the staff. If they could iron out these wrinkles this property has the potential to really shine. But, as it is, the disappointing treatment by the staff is enough to take this off of hotels that I would return to. We booked this hotel for three nights at $180/night via Hotwire.com. This was an excellent value compared to similarly priced hotels in Midtown (where we prefer to stay) which were running in the $250+ range during that time. I did not penalize the hotel because of the location, that is not their fault and we had a good idea of what we were getting into by choosing to stay downtown on a weekend. Simply put, this area of NYC is dead on the weekends because it is the business center of the city. During this time restaurants and even the drug stores close very early--if they are open at all. Also, subway travel is very hit or miss to this area because they are rebuilding two of the stations and service is frequently suspended or re-routed during the weekends. Cabs are available at the hotel, with a ride to Midtown running $12-14 each way, plus tip. Ultimately, we felt very removed from the city and probably would not stay in this area again. Upon arrival we were checked in by a very friendly efficient staff member. The lobby, while compact, is beautiful. The rooms are quite spacious by New York City standards. Decor is very clean, almost minimalist in a palette of neutral colors. Furnishings are of upscale quality and in very good, almost new condition which makes sense as the hotel only reopened (after a full renovation) in 2003. The closet was small but did have plenty of hangers, a full-sized ironing board, and even two umbrellas (though I'd gladly trade the umbrellas for having robes in the room). The large flat screen television was nice, but we were disappointed with the poor picture quality on several channels and a remote control that only worked half of the time. Also, the on screen hotel services menu (where you can check your folio, check out, etc.) did not work. Because of the building's small footprint the rooms are only on the ends and one side of the building (as opposed to both sides), with end rooms being suites and middle rooms being the standard sized rooms. All standard rooms (such as the one we stayed in) view the WTC site and World Financial Center buildings (striking views). Windows near the elevators have superb views of the lower east side, Brooklyn Bridge, etc. Our service problems started almost immediately. We called guest services to request two additional pillows. They said they would be right up. After 45 minutes we received a call from guest services to confirm that they had arrived...which of course they hadn't. They apologized and said they would be right there. After another 45 minutes I called guest services to let them know we STILL hadn't received the pillows. Again, they apologized and said they would be right there. After 20 more minutes they did. Two phone calls and nearly TWO HOURS for extra pillows is ridiculous. This property touts \"The Bed\" by Hilton which is--supposedly--a premium bed. I found the mattress to be entirely too firm and NOT EVEN CLOSE to a Westin Heavenly bed. This is not a \"pillow top\" type of mattress but rather a regular inner spring mattress with a little add-on pad strapped to it. The linens were acceptable, though nothing special. Another disappointing issue for us was the lack of an in-room coffee maker...even Motel Six offers this basic feature. You shouldn't be required to get dressed, go downstairs and get coffee in the morning (and the coffee place is probably closed anyway because this is downtown on the weekend)...or be forced to pay $10/carafe with a $4 delivery fee and 15% service charge. Bathrooms are spacious and bright. Toiletries are Crabtree & Evelyn. The towels are very nice, designer type ones; however, I did notice that on the third day housekeeping started mixing much cheaper, lower quality, non-matching towels in with the good ones. Robes and slippers are only available by request and even then it took 45 minutes and two phone calls to get them (yet another problem with guest services). The robes were very scratchy and uncomfortable...I had not idea you could get cotton to feel that way. We dined using room service twice. The first time was perfect. Unfortunately the second time was a disaster. We called and they said they would call right back to take our order. After waiting 35 minutes for them to call back (unacceptable) we called again to find out the reason for the delay. They apologized and said they would call us right back to take our order (what is with the calling back thing, why can't they just take the order right then?). After another five minutes they did call back to take our order. The meal itself, was pretty much inedible (the french fries were mushy, and the burger incinerated). After returning to the hotel on our final night neither one of our keys would work so we had to go all the way back downstairs to have them recoded. The front desk person rather than simply apologizing and recoding them started implying that we must have done something to demagnetize them (what this might have been I can't even imagine). But apparently it was our fault by the way she reacted. Also related to staff issues, the doormen are VERY inconsistent with some bordering on rude.

The stay started out a little rocky since we were told that our car would be parked off site and we would not have access to it for the duration of our visit. I am guessing this is not uncommon in NYC, but still inconvienent. Then, when we checked in we were told at registration that the room had only one bed! This was unacceptable since there were 4 of us and my reservation had specifically stated that I had reserved a room with 2 beds. After assuring us that there were no rooms with two beds in the entire hotel (suites included) for nearly 10 minutes, they \"magically\" found one on the 42nd floor. I have to say they were pleasant during this entire process but it took some major patience and negotiating to resolve. Once these initial snafus were past us, the rest of the weekend was a blast! The room was immaculate and well stocked with towels and glasses and provided an impressive view uptown and of the Hudson. The cleaning staff did a excellent job and the concierge and bellman were all eager to help us enjoy our stay. The hotel location is in the Financial District so it tended to get a little quiet at night (it's no Times Square). However, there is a nice subway station at Ground Zero right in front of the hotel and taxi service from the side door (the actual front entrance was under construction while we were there). We found it easy to get anywhere from this hotel by using either the train ($2/per person) or getting a cab (usually less than $10). The only real gripe I have with the stay is that the room got really hot after the first night and there was no effective way to cool it down. Only one small section of our window would open and even then it only moved about 2 inches. It was 34 degrees out but our room constantly hovered around 80 degrees with the A/C on. The front desk said that their HVAC system was based on hot water so when it is heating season, there is no A/C and vice versa. This seems pretty archaic to me so, to future winter travelers I would recommend keeping a window open since you can always heat up the room if necessary.

I would head their every morning at 7:45 when it opens (my husband would still be in bed ) and check out all the new inventory and great deals ! I totally recommend this Hotel to anyone. The location is a little ways away from the business of time square but with the subway so conviently located it takes you know time to see all that new York has to offer.

We landed just as the snow started falling and were lucky to get to the hotel before it fell really hard. We had no problems at all with the hotel, staff were fast and efficient during check in and check out, our room was great on the 17th floor, great beds, lots of room and as mentioned before, 42\" plasma, which to be honest we didn't have time to watch other than to get updates on the weather. Each time we needed to take a taxi at night, the door staff were pleased to help. We used the pool and sauna one evening but found the pool a little cool. After lots of recommendations for Stage Door Deli just over the road, we ate breakfast there each morning and have to say that was a great. Everything you could want is done with no fuss and we got breakfast with drinks each day for under $10 for the two of us. We used the subway to get uptown each day and this was really easy and only took approx 5-10 mins, one word of warning beware of people telling you the ticket machine isnt taking cash and selling you an all day pass for $7, this happened to us at Chamber St Station and the ticket we were given was just a single journey ticket which would cost just $2 The man looked like he worked at the subway so naively we trusted him. After that we just bought our ticket from the machine or ticket booth. We ate at some great places, fistly a place in Tribeca which we walked to from the hotel, called Edwards, a nice friendly bistro, good food at good prices. Our second night we thought we would try Chinatown, this turned out to be a big disappointment as there were very few places to eat that were open and when we did find one we were told we couldn't come in, for what reason we will never know, anyway not to be deterred we carried on walking to Little Italy and came across a busy place (considering how much snow was on the ground) called Amici's II, again great service from our waiter called Fabrizio and lovely food at good prices. He even got us a private car home at the end of the evening. Our final night was at a restaurant called Garage in Greenwich Village, this was fantastic, live jazz music each night, superb food and service from our waiter Keith who looked after us so well.

We decided on the Millennium Hilton because of the good price that was on offer when we booked through Expedia, plus I didn't fancy staying in a midtown hotel. Overall I have to say that the service at this hotel was some of the best I have had at a 4*+ hotel. The staff would answer the phone after on ring and there was always someone to hand on the main desk. The rooms were large by New York standards, we had a King deluxe suite, and were well appointed with high speed internet access, plenty of stationary, Crabtree & Evelyn bath products, digital climate control, three setting power shower and the infamous 42\" plasma screen. The standard king size \"The Bed\" is one of the most comfortable beds I have stayed in and was well received after all the walking we did. As for the view, we were on the 21st floor and we had a fabulous view of the Hudson River. As for the view of Ground Zero, whilst it is sobering the first time you see it from up high you quickly realise that New York and its residents have moved on and won't let it get the better of them and soon you feel the same way. I read in a previous review about the Stage Door Deli located on Vesey Street. This place serves up some of the best \"Hero's\" in New York at very reasonable prices. The breakfast is bigger, nicer and 1/3 of the price in the hotel. The swimming pool and sauna is a nice addition and like the bed is very welcome after a long day out. Century 21 located next door is a must. I picked up a pair of Hugo Boss jeans for $90 reduced from $180. There are bargains all over the store and the place is busy all day with long queues for the changing rooms. Now for the hidden surprise. Hilton charges a fee of $75 per night to cover incidentals. This is deducted from your credit card when you check in. If, like myself, you rely on you credit card it can come as a surprise when your card is rejected. As with European hotels your credit card details are taken when you check in but instead of assessing any costs and deducting them from your card when you check out, they deduct $75 per night there and then. They do not tell you that they will deduct it straight away nor is it explained in any of their literature. I was told that it did explain on the Hilton website but as I did not book through their website I did not read this. I tried to get the money back after the embarrassment of having my card refused only to be told that because it was the weekend they couldn't do anything until the Monday. Now as this was on a Saturday it left us with little money and forced us to eat and drink at the hotel. So make sure you have this covered. Also beware of what the bellboys call a taxi. Out side the hotel will be rows of black cars/limos. Whilst they are licensed by the T&LC they operate a fixed rate and not metered. We took one of these cars from the hotel to the Empire State building and it cost us $24 (without tip) where as the taxi back cost $15 (including tip). However, these cars come in handy going back to JFK because the fixed rate is $50 regardless of how long it takes to get there whereas a taxi is on a meter and it took us nearly an hour to get to the airport at 2pm.", "Date": "February 8, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "portsmouth", "Title": "\u201cSuperb with humble views of ground zero\u201d", "Author": "dave1976", "ReviewID": "UR4443269", "Content": "Stayed here from feb 3rd to feb 6th and had an excellent stay.

The bathroom was a nice size with a tub and shower. we were on the 19th floor and weren't troubled by street noise, however, and it is a biggy, this hotel is beside ground zero. I found it unsettling to be sleeping and having fun so close to an area of such tragedy, and it is right outside the window. The hotel can't help that, and they have no control of the other problem. They are starting to rebuild the site now. The building work starts at about 7 am and goes on for a good 12 hours. We obviously never mentioned it is it sadly has to be done, but you don't usually deliberately book a hotel beside such a mammoth building site. You do get the hotel for a very good rate, so if you are aware of the building works, and are comfortable with being so close to ground zero then it is a very good choice. One thing that badly let the hotel down was the service and the food. We had free breakfast vouchers, and some mornings I couldn't even face it for free! It is very expensive if you do have to pay. 3 blueberry pancakes for example were $16! As to the service, we checked in late so the receptionist said to go to bed he would put the breakfast vouchers under the door. the following morning it took 5 phone calls to get them, by which time we had missed breakfast all together, so my advice - don't leave reception without everything you need! they did give us free room service in the end, which was lovely, fresh and hot, so well worth considering. Everyones Room service trays however stay in the hall from breakfast until 8 - 10 at NIGHT! and it was often after 2 pm before they serviced the room, so that was slow and inconvenient if you need to go back or have visitors, like we did. They do offer a turn down service too, some nights, but not all, there were chocolates! I stay in a lot of hiltons to collect the points. This one has the comfort but not the service, it feels like they have cut back on staff as they have to price it so low, which is a shame as it is a very good choice, good travel links and no changes on the subway from the airport you just catch the A train and get off at Fulton Street.

The extortionate prices of the hotels breakfast ($22pp) can easily be avoided. There ARE a number of good restaurants and deli/diners for that authentic NYC breakfast or brunch in the Financial District. The Stage Door Deli / Essex Cafe and Paninis are all within a few hundred metres and offer great value for money and are recommended both for food quality and that edgy NYC atmosphere. For dinner we would heartily recommend Giovanni's Atrium ( Italian ) and Les Halles ( French ) both exellent and again within easy walking distance. O'Haras Bar/Restaurant next to the Fire Station adjacent to Ground Zero is 'ok' but couldn't be recommended, pretty basic food and service, and not that cheap. Worth seeing/doing while you are there? USS Intrepid, Circle Line Boat Trip, Central Park etc. At the Empire State Building, avoid the queues and buy the virtual flight tickets off the guys in the yellow jackets who will offer you tickets while you are in the queue for the Empire. Sure its a few extra dollars but it will save you anything up to a 3 to 4hr wait. Another alert! We bought a City Pass book for a number of attractions prior to going. It states in the City Pass that it allows you to beat the queues and go straight to the front of the line....it doesn't work, you will be directed to joint the queue at the back just like everyone else. National History Museum adjacent to Central Park.It's good BUT probably needs at least two days to do it justice. Cabs were an total lottery.

Just along the street from there is a great piano/singalong bar where you will be entertained by Broadway singers for the price of your beers.

Despite being early check-in, they had a room on the 45th floor ready and awaiting my arrival. First, realize this hotel is downtown, near Wall St. and immediately across the street from Ground Zero. Built in the early 1990's, the hotel was damaged by the scumbags, closed for nearly 2 years, and completely re-vamped. I stayed in the regular 1King bed room. This is the most basic room at the hotel. For more $ you can get a junior suite, which offers some more room, and a view that looks more uptown rather than downtown. Some consider this a plus. For me, ground zero, the buildings around ground zero, the Hudson River with its traffic, and NJ and the sunsets made my view the best in the hotel. All rooms offer the large plasma TV, nice work table with convenient internet and electrical plugs, floor to ceiling windows and in-room safe. No in-room wireless internet (wireless in lobby/lounge/restaurant only). They charge $5.95 per 24 hours, or $9.95 if you must log on to your own internet provider. They will give you the T1 cord for a $10 deposit. Rooms very comfortable. Bed nice and well appointed with sheets and comforter. Closet small-enough room for 1 person but would be stretching it for 2 people. The dresser is dominated by mini-bar, mini-refer which doesn't leave a lot of drawer space. Bathrooms very nice w/marble and a good shower up high so someone 6'2\" or so doesn't have to bend over to wash hair. Towels and bathroom amenities servicable. Note only one sink-may be 2 in the junior suite - if that's an issue, check. Not only is the room comfortable and new, the view is stunning. I was there for the 911 aniversary/memorial. To look out and see the crowds and the firetrucks and police cars and mourners and everyone else paying their respects was staggering. To be able to walk out the door and across the street and be Right There was amazing. A lot of people suggest staying up towards ( or in) Times Square so you can really be a part of the party. I disagree and am more than happy I stayed at the M. Hilton. 15 minute walk to L.Italy/Chinatown. 15 to Wall St. 15 to ferry boats to NJ. Anything further, there is a subway stop a block away, or just catch a cab. It is quieter and less congested down here than up at Times Sq. It is convenient to go up in the evening, see Times, see the lights and masses of people and hawkers, and for me; cool to leave it behind and come back to the hotel. Also, restaurant and room service both very good - if you do get room service, realize you are paying $4 plus 15% on top of the price of food. This is the tip. Don't leave more money after you are already forced to tip (unless you are just really generous - if so, give me a call). I had no time for pool and no need for work-out after all the hiking I did each day, so I can not comment on either of those facilities. My minor complaint: while room was clean, there were a couple strands of hair in tub. I seem to see this almost everywhere I stay, yet I don't like it and find it disquieting - once I see that I question the cleanliness of the rest of the room and am on the lookout for something else to complain about. Other very minor incident - on 9/11 I removed DND sign from door and went to GZ. Returned 2 hrs. later and room not yet cleaned. Called housekeeping then took computer down to lounge, had a drink, sent a couple emails, returned 50 minutes later, and room was completed. No big deal. I will certainly stay at the Millenium Hilton again. In fact, I am already planning my next trip in 2006 to NYC, and have no cause to stay anywhere else. Last advice, if you do stay at a Hilton property, become a member of their frequent guest club. 500 miles per stay or a couple other options.

If anyone in your crowd likes to shop, the hotel is located right next door to Century 21---which for those of you from the south, is a little like a Steinmart or TJ Maxx on steriods. The only downside, at least for those of us in the tourist crowd, is the location of the hotel compared to midtown attractions. You are a $12-15 cab ride, or a pretty lengthy subway ride to midtown---even more if you are going to the museums on either the upper east or upper west side. Many could see this as a positive, since this hotel is in a very quiet part of town. On the upside, however, you are within a block of two very large subway stations, from which you can catch nearly any of the major lines. The subway is very easy to use, though if you catch a local train, it is probably a 15-25 minute ride into midtown---and you will want to cab it back to this hotel if you come back late at night. Finally, leaving the hotel is quite easy. The bell station arranged all of our travel back to the airport, and actually found us a town car that cost us less than our cab ride in to town.", "Date": "August 14, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago", "Title": "\u201cWonderful Hotel\u201d", "Author": "PattiJ", "ReviewID": "UR3751991", "Content": "We had a suite on the 52nd floor overlooking Ground Zero.

I'm not clear on the logic of having a 42\" plasma screen with only an analogue input?!? A fair few of the available channels showed poor reception but, really, who comes to New York to sit in the hotel room and watch TV? The only other thing of note was that the internet access via the TV and wireless keyboard, although a bit of a novelty and not too expensive, wasn't the most complete internet browsing experience. It's based on a bespoke web browser at a very low resolution so not too many websites I visited actually displayed properly (like my web based email!!!) Having read previous reviews I knew to avoid the hotel's restaurant on reasons of cost and try the many local deli's, so I can't comment on the quality of the food. There really are LOADS of places within a couple of blocks radius to pick up food and drink so no need to break the bank in the inhouse restaurant if you don't want to. It's true, the New York subway may not be as intuitive as, say, London's underground but we bought a week long pass (available from the machines in the subway) and used it every day to get from practically outside the hotel door to midtown. If you've never been before, perhaps best to download a subway map before you go and spend 10 minutes or so working out how it all works. We were jumping on and off trains like locals by the time we left! In terms of shopping and attractions in the local vicinity, you're right across the street from Century 21 which, although not really to my taste, certainly has bargains (the missus was able to pick up a Samsonite suitcase cheaper there than it was available in a so called Samsonite discount outlet store). If you're willing to rake through stuff, you'll probably unearth something. About a 5-10 minute walk South and you'll be in Battery Park where you get on the ferry over to the Statue of Liberty (try dodging the vendors offering 'real' rolex watches and 'genuine' LV handbags if you can). J&R is a pretty large computer/gadget shop a couple of blocks North East of the hotel and had some pretty reasonably priced kit. About 7 or 8 blocks West of the hotel at South Street Seaport is what appears to be NYC's only Abercrombie and Fitch store, and very swanky it is too (I spent far too much money in here), with Guess is just over the road and the downtown TCKTS shop just around the corner (speaking of which, try getting there an hour before it opens to be at the head of the queue and best choice of theatre tickets). It's a bit of a trek, but SOHO and NOHO (just head north on Broadway) has some pretty decent shopping too (well, better than the tourist-trap midtown, I reckon). Finally, on checking out (no queues again) there weren't any nasty surprises on the bill, just what I expected (although, again, after reading previous reviews I knew not to fiddle with the contents of the in-room minibar). The concierge, thankfully, was more than happy to look after our luggage for the day while we were out spending our last few hours and last few dollars. A godsend when you have an evening flight home but checkout is at midday. I have absolutely no reservation in recommending this hotel, it's certainly where I'll be staying next time I'm in NYC. PS. Not that it has any relation to the Millenium Hilton, but I'd pre-booked a Super Shuttle van to and from the hotel/airport. The driver taking us to the hotel couldn't have been much more rude, and the driver taking us back to the airport turned up nearly an hour late, literally a few minutes before I was going to abandon hope and just get a taxi rather than risk missing the flight.

We had made reservations for a king bed (the only thing available on the Hilton reservation site), but they let us change to 2 double beds at check in (no extra charge). We had a partial view of Ground Zero. The room was very quiet during the night despite the fact that the hotel was either at or near capacity. When we checked in at 9 AM, we left our bags---the front desk was very quiet and the person behind the desk very helpful. When I returned at 4 PM to actually pick up my keys, it was a different story---with 6 people behind the desk they seemed really overwhelmed and there was a line that seemed to last longer than it should have. Getting someone to help with my bags up to the room seemed impossible, so I took my own stuff up, which was OK, except for the fact that when I got to the room, neither of the two keys that they gave me worked. Called down with the phone in the hall and a security person came right up, confirmed my ID, and gave me a key that did work.

As stated in most of the other reviews, Ground Zero was across the street of the hotel, Century 21 shopping was on one side, while the oldest church in NY was on the other. During the day, the streets are jam packed with people going to work, or visitors paying their respects to Ground Zero, at night... empty. It was so convenient to have the subway just a couple steps from the hotel to bring you wherever you wanted to go in the city, plus taxi comming around every second to look for passengers. If you got the legs and pretty fit to walk a long distance, you can always walk 5-10 min north to Canal St, Chinatown, shops in broadway, and SoHo's. Another 5-10 min south to battery park to catch a cruise ship to see the statue. Overall, the stay was wonderfull.

Our king corner room was on the 53rd floor and we had such fabulous city views, I found myself waking up in the wee hours of the morning just to see the spectacular sunrises. Watching the sleepy city come to life was one of the high points of our trip. The evening views were wonderful as well, with the buildings all sophisticated shimmer. Probably to the shock of a few dedicated office workers, we slept with the curtains wide open, just to revel in the wonderful glittery magic. I often use Trip Advisor and I'm pleased the reviews were spot on. We stayed at the Regency on Park Avenue earlier on our trip and did not like it at all! Overpriced, snooty and the room was dull in comparison. I would have liked a coffee pot, but we had a Starbucks right around the corner. It really is taking over the world! The room was very clean, room service efficient and we enjoyed the plasma television. My husband had a hard time saying his goodbyes. I agree with other reviewers that ground zero was a sobering experience. I was a bit apprehensive before we visited as I wasn't sure what to expect - but people paying their respects seem to bear this in mind and it makes it a lot less of a circus affair and more of a quiet, respectful memorial. Still difficult to take in though... The staff at the hotel were cheerful and helpful. We read about the electronic fridges so didn't even attempt to open it to gaze at the forbidden goodies. There is a giftstore downstairs with (still) expensive and limited snacks, but a lot cheaper than the minibar. Around the corner from the hotel you will find a few shops that sell ciggies, beverages and sweets - stockup for midnight munchies. The hotel has icebuckets and ice for your sodas. We had breakfast only once in the hotel and found it expensive and so-so. There is a Stage deli near the church half a block away, or wander around until you hit a diner type serving breakfast. The area is very rushed during weekdays (especially lunch!) with all the workers milling around. The weekend can be a little bit of a let down with some restaurants only catering to the Mon-Fri crowd, but this is an excellent time to get some shopping done or visit some of the other places on your list like Chinatown. Speaking of shopping - Century 21 is right next door - Their motto is 'New York's best kept secret', but we joked that the secret was out because EVERYONE seems to know about it. We foolishly attempted to shop on Friday at 5:30 PM - we could barely walk through the store. We returned on Sunday afternoon and it was slightly less crowded. South Seaport is a short walk away - a nice surprise and a twist on the usual mall scene with good seafood to be had. It is relaxing just to walk around and look at the boats and water with benches for you to gaze and take in the tranquility. Greenwich, Soho etc/ all a subway away for more trendy shopping - and Times Square is dead easy to get to for more hectic fun.

The rates were reasonable, around $175.00/ night (non-holiday weekend), but was dissappointed to find that they do not have any double occupancy rooms. We were forced to reserve 3 rooms to accomodate everyone. The rooms are decently-sized and clean. Each room has a large flat screen tv and a king sized bed. The location is excellent, very close to canal street (Chinatown, Little Italy) and directly across the street from the World Trade Center/ Ground Zero. We had a dead on view of what used to be a modern marvel; 2 110-story office buildings which were cities within themselves. I spent a lot of time staring out the window reflecting on 9-11, it was a humbling experience. Ok, here are my biggest gripes with this hotel: 1) There is NO lobby, and the small foyer in which you check in and out is so crowded and you will be waiting a while so I would suggest you stay somewhere else if you are at all claustrophobic. Also, this means there is no where to sit and relax or hang out. 2) The breakfast buffet. The bill was over $80 for 4 of us to eat at the buffet at the hotel's restaurant Church & Dey. The buffet was small, poorly stocked and WAY over-priced. There was hardly any food left when we ate at 10:00 a.m. on Sunday. 3) The parking staff is hurrendous. We called ahead as they advised us to in order to avoid a wait. We packed and made our way down to the garage 45 minutes later to get our car only to wait another 45 minutes. No one would even look at us or ask us if we were being helped and finally after 25 minutes the attendant asked for our voucher. It was only then that he told us we had to have the voucher validated at the front desk first. We had to go back to the front desk and wait on the long line of guests checking out to get the stamp. Mind you, we had already waited on the line to check out, so I was very irritated to have to do it again. The parking staff was rude and unapologetic. 5) Examine your final bill carefully, they charged us for items in the minibar that were not taken. Seems they will charge you if you move an item to a different spot in the fridge even if it's unopened. 6) Last but not least, we had reserved 3 rooms, however the third room would not be occupied until the second night. We realized this glitch in our schedule too late to change our reservations so we decided to check all 3 rooms in upon arrival and leave the 3rd empty for the 1st night. We asked them to hold the keys at the front desk for our 3rd party until their arrival. All 3 rooms were to be adjacent to eachother on the same floor. When it came time for our 3rd party to get their key, the front desk informed us that they had given the room away. The room we had ALREADY PAID FOR! Turns out they, LUCKILY, had ONE room unoccupied that night due to an early check-out. We had no other choice, so we took the room which was on another floor. The front desk staff handled this situation terribly. They never apologized or seemed to realize what an inconvenience they had caused us. Had there been no more rooms in the hotel, what would we have done? PLUS this room was already paid for AND checked in! How could they have given it away? Bottom line, I wouldn't stay there again.

The hotel is across from the PATH train station to New Jersey, so this is a great location if you are coming in from Newark Airport.

I rate it above the Ritz-Carlton, W hotels, Tribeca Grand, and other 4- and 5-stars I've frequented. Our most recent stay was on a whim at the end of June; we were going into the city to see one of the Fahrenheit premieres, and decided to stay over because we love New York so much. Our cityview king room on the 51st floor had a breathtaking view of the Hudson River, ground zero, and to the north, the West Village and the Midtown skyline. When you reserve, make sure to request a room above the 45th floor. You will be above it all - especially if you stay before they construct the new world trade center. I sincerely recommend the King Corner rooms - when they're available, they're my favorite hotel rooms in New York, save for, maybe, the suites at The Donald's place... :) The bed was awesome...not quite a Heavenly Bed, but we slept wonderfully. The best features of the room always are the huge plasma screen TV with web access, and the big, comfy ergonomic leather chair at the desk. Room service was surprisingly good for the Hilton, but if you must eat their food, go downstairs to the Church & Dey dining room and have a proper dinner. For breakfast, there's a starbucks right next door and around the corner on Dey street. This hotel is convenient to the Tribeca/Soho party scene; the Tribeca Grand hotel is directly up Church st.. We enjoyed being in close proximity to the World Financial Center shops and the very cool Irish Hunger Memorial (located on the river across the street from ground zero), which we were able to see from our room. Now, about the staff. I've read people's complaints about rude or short employees that did not come off as overtly friendly...well...the truth of the matter is, the Millenium Hilton is a very large hotel, and the staff does seem rather stressed at times. However, if you take it all with a grain of salt and don't expect to be treated like absolute royalty (that's what $500/night places uptown are expected to be for), you will see that they're just simple hard working folks in the hotel business who are trying to run a first class operation. Oh - I almost forgot. The health club and indoor pool are fantastic, especially very early in the morning when they're empty. They also have a business center where you can print documents from the internet. If you can score a rate of under $199 per night, you'll love this hotel even more.

The bellman had to go search for the front desk clerk who finally arrived after about 5 minutes. No apology (yet no attitude either). While waiting, we picked up a strong odor of insecticide throughout the lobby and when we inquired we were notified the hotel just got sprayed - mmm yummy! Anyway, checked into the room which was decorated nicely tho a bit small but hey it's NYC. Next, wanted to check out the piece of equipment that brought me here in the first place...the plasma. Big dissapointment. Not hi-def and in fact, most programs had horrible reception. Other points to note, bathroom very nicely done.

As we were going back for our New York wedding and honeymoon we wanted everything to be just right. I was worried by some of the previous reviews which I had read before I left for New York. Well, I returned from New York yesterday and can honestly say that our stay in the Millenium Hilton was perfect. Other people have reported check in problems. We arrived early (2.10) and they checked us right in without a problem. The girl on the desk was efficient and when I asked if we could have a high floor for the view she allocated us a room on floor 52 which was a dream come true as this hotel has some of the best views in town. The bellhop was friendly and also efficient, escorting us to our room with our luggage. The elevators are amazingly quick and each floor only has eleven rooms (or thereabouts) which reduces noise and traffic in the corridors and means you don't have far to go to reach the elevator. The area outside the elevators on each floor is carpeted, so no footsteps while you are trying to sleep, and has a huge window with views to the rear of the hotel (i.e. the other side to the view from your room) - including the Brooklyn Bridge and the Woolworth building, and City Hall. Whatever floor you are on, you can travel to a high floor to see this. The room is a fair size for a New York room, with a wonderfully comfortable bed, tasteful furnishings and of course that plasma TV. You also get a desk with a reclining leather chair, and comfortable fabric covered chair, a small drinks table (plus glasses and an ice bucket of course), and more storage space than is usual in city hotels. Monday to Friday you get a newspaper at your door. The safe is easy to use and a handy feature. The bathroom is the best hotel bathroom I have seen, spacious and spotless. In fact everything is perfectly clean, and housekeeping are very thorough when they visit each day and also polite and friendly if you happen to meet them. Towels and bedlinen are all spotless and look new. The Neutrogena toiletries are a welcome touch and these are replenished if you use them so there is more than enough for your stay. And I haven't even told you about the best bit yet - the view! Yes, it is dominated by the World Trade Centre crater, but the work there now is preparing for rebuilding rather than tearing down (though one building remains to be dismantled). The World Financial Centre is opposite, and the Hudson river beyond where you can see some spectacular sunsets. Words can't do justice to the sight you see each time you draw back the curtains on the floor to ceiling windows but for us it was the highlight of our stay in New York. Each time we returned to our room it was a pleasure to be in this clean, comfortable, cool haven after the busy city streets, and to relax by the window and watch the hustle and bustle below was the best bit of all. The only thing that didn't work was the Interactive check out through the TV but we had nothing to pay on our account (no rogue charges at all, thankfully) and it took only a couple of seconds at the desk to check out. Our luggage was stored free of charge for us to collect later in the day, which took only minutes though they told us to allow 15min.

I attempted to check in and was told that check in was 3:30 PM. Not a problem....they took my bags and told me that they would call my cell phone when the room was ready. I spent the rest of the day exploring. They never called my cell phone, and when I returned at about 6 PM I was told that there were no more double rooms left. To compensate, we were upgraded to a king suite. That was quite nice although there was only one real bed, and a sofa bed. The room, however more than made up for this inconvenience. It had amazing views and great amenities. The front desk staff at this hotel can be very slow and not helpful. Make sure that, prior to your stay, you call and check all of the details of your stay. If you are staying in a room that is being paid for by someone other than yourself and that person is not staying in the room, BE SURE to request a credit card authorization form.
