As someone who like to work hard and play hard, their bar and club recommendations were much appreciated. Thanks Cindy and Tricia! This is the first time that I have felt compelled to make a point of telling the desk staff how much I loved the place and my time there.

We were told that this represented a $500. plus value. The first disappointment when we arrived was being told by Valet staff that parking would cost $32. per night. This was not printed on the coupon nor at the website, so having arrived late in the evening and being unfamiliar with the local parking garages, we opted to use the valet service. We were shown to a very small room on the 4th floor. We knew that the decor had a unique, urban style, but we were disappointed that there was no table or chairs in the room, apart from the bed, wall desk, and desk chair under the windows. Mostly, we were unprepared for the constant noise which we heard from the bars and clubs surrounding the hotel. This went on until 2 AM., followed by construction sounds, busses, garbage trucks, and raucous street people below our windows, which were closed. Needless to say, we did not get any sleep. We requested a room change in the morning but were told that the only room left was the penthouse (at a $30) surcharge directly above our room. We declined and checked out and relocated to the delightful Bay Club and Marina on Shelter Island. Check out my review for same, which will be much more laudatory than this one! In the future, we will check out the Travel Zoo \"deals\" more carefully before we commit. I should mention that the staff at the Keating delivered \"service with a smile\" and was very accommodating.", "Date": "December 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Santa Barbara", "Title": "\u201cPerfect for a couple in love\u201d", "Author": "kbinsb", "ReviewID": "UR122163467", "Content": "This hotel is in a superb location, with the Gaslamp District literally outside your door.

It is what most would consider an extended stay and so I feel this review should be considered before selecting this hotel. It's gonna be a long one but all events are truthful none exaggerated. I feel the information provided will be helpful. I work hard and play hard traveling throughout the world and so every few months I like to make the best of my vacations at all costs. I usually take 3 wks each time always go back to San Diego for a week or so being I have properties there and my toys and I like to check up on those things every few months. This recent vacation I took I went away to San Diego for 12 nights and then to The Dominican Republic for 13 days. (DR is a great place I highly recommend it) This review is directed towards those that like to \"Live A Little\" and really like to enjoy your vacation or getaway without worries. I'm throwing in the star to the staff. My compliments to the staff you deal with personally. Four people that stuck out in my mind as great were Andra, Brandon, I believe the gentleman's name is parker sorry if I messed that up, and the other young lady that helped me secure information on bottle service at the hottest night clubs in Downtown San Diego the last weekend I was there. Kudos to you all. The noise and other things others have complained about didn't bother me after I put on my earplugs being I knew what I was getting into as I read the reviews. Not a problem there. If in San Diego depending on the season I stay at The Gas Lamp or Mission Beach. Being I stay at the Gas Lamp anyways this location was as good as others not OMG status as the reviews may say. I liked the room and cleanliness. The Housekeeping did an excellent job throughout my stay. I did make sure I called everyday on my way out though just in case not because it was necessary. My complaint about the room though is that because of the concrete floor it can get very cold. Be aware of that I'd prefer rug as it is more cozy but again this wasn't something I didn't know about just thought I would remind those as the cold will get colder :) My two biggest complaints were the food and parking. Not so much the taste of the food though one night I ate at the restaurant downstairs and for an Italian place I though it would be more authentic and tasty. I'll give them the benefit of doubt and say that maybe it was the plate I ordered never the less I wasn't convinced and so I didn't return. I will say that at the restaurant the service and the wine were great. Of course at cost ;) All in all it is a classy place and a nice environment. I did eat at the other option many times at The Keating and have to say I found it humorous. I like to think that most of the hotels I've chosen before are bigger with their own kitchens etc and so when I order something from my room at of course a higher price than I would get it down the street it usually comes fresh, crisp lettuce, tomatoes, cuts, made to order etc. Hey nothing agains room service I always get it I understand demand meets supply and yes I'd like for it to be prepared for me and delivered thank you ;) Well at The Keating, if you order from your room one not knowing would think the kitchen has received a call, your order placed, a slip has been created, cutting and dicing is now taking place. Actually, the items on the menu that are not served during the restaurant hours. Everything else like pizza, sandwiches etc that is not a la carte comes from this average, sandwich shop around the corner where the sandwich items are already cut and exposed, sandwiches and pizza prepared in a display case waiting for your call so that the \"chef\" can take it from the display box and toss it in the oven for a crisp toasty sensation ;P I found that humorous as once I learned that was the case my not so fresh 20 dollar pizza or 14 dollar sandwich were much more acceptable being if I walked downstairs myself I would only have to pay 6 bucks and get a free drink vice delivery chargers for something already there :) I mean it wasn't going to taste any different if I ordered it from the room or not. Again... just trying to enjoy each meal to the fullest while on vacation here not so much. My other disappointing experience was the Hotel's parking I own two custom American Classic Cadillacs. A 1962 Cadillac Coupe DeVille and a 1966 Cadillac Coupe DeVille Convertible. These are no clunkers over 40k has gone into the customization and restoration of the 66 and about 20k to the 62. In other words. Everything is working as it did then or better on the vehicles. Attached are pictures. This is where The Keating fails. Their parking is not managed by hotel staff. It is ran and managed by ACE parking staff. They've set up a large booth structure closest to the street in front of the hotel. They park public vehicles that pull up in search of parking for a night out in town etc. Here is where the personal relationship and responsibility that one would get at any hotel when handing the keys over to valet is LOST. THE FEAR is that ACE parks your vehicle at The Horton Plaza parking this plays into the fear that your rental, new sports car, classic, or car with valuables is exposed in public to not enough security, numerous floors of cars backing up, driving in and out independently potentially damaging your vehicle, or a crowded weekend with one or two thieves. Not to mention the lack of attention to detail by the arrangement of parking on The Keating's part. THE NIGHTMARE: Where it fails is this valet finds themselves in a hurry running back and forth a block or two to park vehicles and try to attend the next customer to get a dollar or a tip that your car which you entrusted to valet was never really looked after or considered in the first place. They really didn't care. I asked the hotel staff to please make sure the car was parked under a roof. The answer was our parking compound is underground so I don't see why it wouldn't be. I said okay thank you but please make sure it is. \"No problem sir we will\" again this is where the lack of attention to detail and responsibility turned into an issue and could to you. If it happened to my vehicle a luxury classic car, a real looker, that gets compliments everywhere, people want to take pictures by it or of it, and is nothing but appreciated by the public. Why shouldn't it happen to the average luxury car you worked so hard for? On my second or third night it got cloudy and rained for two days/nights. Earlier before the rain I had given my car to valet. Two nights/3 days later I was up downstairs early and asked for my car to begin my day as there was business I needed to attend to and the rain had cleared. I'm then asked to go help assist in turning on my car. Here is where I discovered the dirty little secret about the parking. Not only was my car nowhere near the hotel but they parked it on the outside lot of the Horton Plaza The reason was that the dual batteries were drained being the lights were left on at the time of parking. So somebody turned on the lights, drove my car away, parked it and walked away without bothering or look back to catch the lights left on. Not even a security guard saw it to notify the ACE staff. It was left unattended and unsupervised long enough to drain two Optima performance batteries. This is where it really got ugly. Not only was the car not parked in the structure it was parked by the street and sidewalk, the lights left on, but the windows where NEVER ROLLED UP. So that morning I walk up to my car and when I open the doors the mats on the floor are covered in water, the carpet is a mush, the seats are wet and I am forced to get a jump after of course I move the knob to the off position with the big letters that read \"LIGHTS.\" I was a bit upset when I found a note inside the car that said. \"Found at so and so time, on date (was two nights before) with the windows open and car unlocked. Must lock vehicle to secure items. Please call SDPD at 619-531-2000 if items are missing\" One of the hotel staff was shocked as he stood in front of what was a detailed car when I brought it in was now dirty, tree leaves, and soaked inside was just left out there for days/nights. He was shocked he offered the hotel to pay for the detailing. I welcomed the gesture and they did pay for it when I received the car days later but for me what was now a day of business turned into a day of taking it to the shops I've taken them to out of my own pocket to check for water damage under, and in the upholstery etc. I had to leave the car for a detailed inspection and detailing for four days. Fortunately there was no damage found at the time, of course we all know how moisture is to a 45 yr old classic. Of course this took away from me using the car on vacation with the top down on sunny days out around San Diego visiting friends and family as those are the things one looks forward to when far away from home. I was very kind to the men and women of the hotel. Even under It was not their fault as it is the managements responsibility to oversee the subcontracted companies work. When I returned this is where management made a choice to make the guest feel unwelcome. John Tso-etc should not be in charge of the high caliber men and women mentioned at the beginning of my review. My advice would be to learn something from the names listed above in guest relations and service.Upon my return with another car Management the name had directed to the hotel staff to not accept any vehicle that needed valet. So instead I was forced to drive a block or two away and park the vehicle myself at the Horton Plaza walk back to my hotel room to have to repeat the same in the morning when I started my day. The embarrassing part was with a guest and I pulled up to valet only to find out that they would not accept my car so I had to ask her to wait on the street as I had to go up two block inside the horton plaza to park my car. Inconvenient and definitely not welcoming. Was it me that chose to park my car or any car in the street away from secure parking leaving the lights on, doors unlocked on rainy days without even checking up on it to realize the lack of attention to detail? No it was not. It was not fair to me a guest that stayed over for an extended period of time to be treated that way. Especially being that every day after the 4th day that I parked my own car and went back and forth myself I was still charged the 30 something dollars for \"valet service\" and I was the one doing all the work. I could have gone a few blocks further and parked it for 15 dollars a day or even 20 at another spot but staying at the Gas Lamp and having two walk 2 blocks away from your hotel is long enough. Don't get me wrong all the ACE employees were not all bad there was a girl who was kind and a gentleman by the name of Raymundo that was very helpful towards the end of my stay and though I was notified by the hotel staff to park it myself and get it myself Raymundo really wanted to provide a service to the guest. That effort alone was worth a 20 dollar tip given to him for trying ;) John maybe during your working hours being the car was out there for 3 days not to say you have to do it on your free time. Since you are part of management maybe you should do a drive through, or walk through in the hotel and verify the quality of service being provided to your guests or to you from the companies you contract to take care of a service to the customer. I wasn't just someone coming in for a weekend. I was someone actually living in, actively using the minibar, restaurants, amenities and services the hotel had to offer. I've stayed at numerous hotels downtown for extensive stays as this to name a few The W, Marriot, US Grant, Hard Rock, The Andaz formerly the Ivy. It is because of these stays and experiences that I can say The Keating cannot compete with those other luxury names in the Gas Lamp area. Especially not with the actions mentioned taken by management. My recommendation to you is to choose another name if you really want that catering to you, extended friendly stay, that we all pay for in high end hotels. Hey you are only on vacation every few months or only get a chance to get away so often.

Fresh!!! Fabulous!!!\u201d", "Author": "Tahoegirl17", "ReviewID": "UR119308520", "Content": "My husband and I booked our trip on a whim to San Diego through or favorite website luxurylink.com to stay at The Keating for a total of 3 nights. After we booked the hotel, we decided to read previous reviews and at that point, had we booked through a site we were not totally familiar and comfortable with and trusted completely, we may have changed our reservations to another hotel. We kept reading crazy stories that were a bit discerning. In short, we are SO HAPPY we went with our gut instincts to stick with our reservation at The Keating! Our personal experience could not have been better! We had an absolute blast and will definitely stay there again and again! We were greeted with exceptionally warm smiles by the front desk staff and we quickly became friends with all personnel. From Teresa, who made sure our room request was fulfilled to perfection, to Trisha who gave us a personal tour of our room and all its amenities, brought up a bottle of Merlot and and cheese platter upon our arrival, brought pizza to our room one night at 11PM we had a bit too much fun at the little local pub Patricks next door, to recommending the most fabulous hidden secret wine bar, Vin de Syrah (An Alice in Wonderland themed must see!), to the rest of the wonderful staff who brought us delicious breakfast in bed every morning, and yummy treats every evening at turndown..... This is our way of thanking you so very much for your hospitality and taking such wonderful care of us! Having said that, it does pay off to do a little research about this hotel to maximize your stay because it is not for everyone. For starters, look at the photos of the swanky, ultra modern decor. A picture says a thousand words and the hotel rooms look exactly like the pictures. If the decor isn't for you, don't stay there. Secondly, it is located in one of the oldest buildings in the heart of the Gas Lamp District. It is an official historic building and the windows are single-pane. If you are not familiar with the Gas Lamp District, please note it is a very hip, bustling district with shops, restaurants, bars and nightclubs holding different events virtually every night. Because the windows in The Keating are single-pane, if you are sensitive to noise, do yourself a favor and request a room on the penthouse floor. (We did this and had no troubles whatsoever with the street/bar/nightclub noise.) Last but not least, notice in hotel room photos that the shower is an open shower, not completely open, but its not for the modest of people. If you don't want anyone looking at you (spouse, significant other, partner, child/children, friends, etc.) don't book your reservation at The Keating. (My husband and I are comfortable with the exposure - and if you are too, then you should definitely book at The Keating! We loved the rain shower head on the ceiling as well as the hand-held head too!) The Keating building, in its over 100 year history of existence, was home to the original Birdcage, and was at one time, a bank, too. Now, as the first hotel venture of Pininfarina, the makers of Ferrari and Maserati, it boasts 35 rooms, 2 fabulous restaurants and Sway, their official nightclub/Lounge. Definitely check out Sway if you can, it has the original vault used by the previous bank and is a fun historical perk. Another historical fun fact is the elevator in the hotel is the first of it's kind in San Diego, is \"green\" and runs on steam. The Keating was truly a memorable experience, we loved everything about it. The location can't be beat, you can walk to the ocean, the ball park, the Balboa outdoor mall, etc. You are a 5-10 min cab ride from the airport, from Sea World and the San Diego Zoo. There are so many bars and restaurants to choose from! We loved Bandar, a Persian restaurant around the corner from The Keating that has won almost every foodie award possible in San Diego! (The lamb filets are to die for and if you like black cherries, their black cherry rice is amazing!) Also, check out Altitude, a roof-top bar at the Marriott near the baseball stadium, (and order their lemon raspberry cocktails -yummy!!!) Go to another roof top bar at the Andar hotel, formally known as The Ivy (their mojitos are fresh and delicious). As crazy as it sounds, stay away from the sushi restaurants. We went to 2 different restaurants and were very disappointed in the freshness and flavor... and the hype surrounding Nobu is a joke. (Their sushi was the most fresh, by far, but we went there our first night and our dinner for 3 people was almost $500 and we left hungry). Patrick's is the local's hangout next door, they have live music every night and is a really fun pub to visit. And last but certainly not least, if you enjoy wine, you can't miss Vin de Syrah (Wednesday nights are 1/2 off bottles).", "Date": "October 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Phoenix, Arizona", "Title": "\u201cStaff was great\u201d", "Author": "BuySellAZHome", "ReviewID": "UR119265828", "Content": "Loved the Staff.

This is good for those who want easy access to all the pubs/clubs/restaurants/shopping (Horton Plaza).

The rooms are exactly as described - modern and chic. They use Bang & Olufsen for their audio/entertainment systems and have a great LaVazza espresso machine. The bed is very comfortable. The shower in our room was in the corner of the room and completely open to the room. Obviously this type of hotel is not for anyone who has a problem with that. There is noise from the street during the night/morning so if you are a light sleeper you may want to consider other hotels outside of the Gaslamp Quarter. We were on the 4th floor and it was still a little noisy. We had no problems sleeping through the noise, but I can see why others would. Each floor had models of cars designed by the company that designed the hotel. The hallways and common areas were kept in great condition. The elevator is slow, however it can be overlooked since it is steam powered and the oldest in San Diego. We experienced the famous pastries during turndown service and they were a delicious touch. I just wish they had come every night! Check-in/check-out went smooth and without issue. Be aware you'll pay $3/night for a historical fee.

We stayed at the Keating because they said they would accommodate our bachorlette party. I got a separate room from the party because I wanted to sleep that night so I was across the hall from the larger party with 3 in my room. From the minute I got there the room was very uninviting and not comfortable at all. I love modern design and even owned a mid-century home but not a smart idea for a 100 year old building. Who's idea was it not to have carpet in a vintage hotel where the insulation between rooms is terrible and the windows are single pane. No carpet and no drapes equal a very noisy room and boy did I find that out at 6 am in the morning when road construction started and I had earplugs in and it felt the workers were in my bed! I first thought it was trash being picked up but it went on that loud until we checked out. HORRIBLE NOISY ROOMS! I won't even go into the over pretentious design of the rooms and they were not even ergonomically comfortable. The showers are glass with a 3 foot opening (not good for the shy but this wasn't my issue) they were COLD! Between the opening of the glass and the trendy shower head 5ft directly above you it was a very uncomfortable shower. When we came down the stairs with the bachorlette party they were shushing us as we were leaving the hotel and telling us we better not be loud when we got back from going out, really rude attitudes. Lastly, we were there for the weekend so my girlfriend who stayed in my room, we both got valet parking ($35 a night btw). When we checked out in the morning we told them we were leaving our cars for the night and they told us it would be a charge for every night and we said fine. Here is the clincher: My girlfriends car doesn't start right away and they thought it was out of gas so they left it in the street. I came back in the middle of the day around 2pm and the valet Joanna told me about it and said it was no problem that the only thing it would be in the street until we picked it up. I said no problem and asked profusely if it was going to be ok in the street, She replied \" ya, it will have a Ace sticker in it so no one will bother it\" She never mentioned , not once, that it had to be picked up by 5pm. I never asked because I told the front desk we were leaving our cars another night to stay with friends. Well, 10:30pm rolls around and thats when they decide to call me to tell me they are towing my friends car away in 30 minutes or less. At this point I was in bed and did not get the phone call so my friends car did get towed away. Are you kidding me, we leave a car for valet and it gets towed away by the HOTEL! Why didn't they start calling me at 5pm when I was awake and I could move it but they waited until we were both asleep miles away. The next day we went back to the hotel and Joanna told me that she told me it had to be picked up by 5pm and this is not true at all. I had another friend with me and both of us know she did not tell us it had to be picked up by 5pm. Well, here is the REAL KICKER! We picked the car up from the tow yard and the tow guy was like, \"this car's not out of gas, I drove it off the truck\" Are you kidding me. We paid our $315 and she proceeded to drive it a few blocks away to a gas station. It was low but NOT out of gas. Of course no one immediately at the premises of the hotel could help me so I had to call on Monday to talk with Christos Brooks. He wasn't there so I left a message explaining the whole thing. Christos NEVER called me back so I had to call him back again the next day. He told me that he was aware of the story and that we were terrible guest and we smoked in the room (which btw I did leave the room for a bit and I think someones smoked in my bathroom so I did not complain the next morning and quietly paid the $200 fee) and we did not deserve any compensation and we were terrible guest and he was not going to do anything about it and we could take it up in court if we wanted. All I can say is this hotel did everything wrong, from the badly designed rooms, poor customer service and then the manager didn't even return my call to hear what I had to say the next day. Bad business all the way around and I would not recommend this hotel to anyone even if you have a coupon for 50% off, go stay at Motel 6, I think you will get a better night of sleep and its probably decorated more comfortable.

When we arrived there was no valet and no bell man to help bring our luggage up. Our first night we were in a room situated directly above a blues bar that shares the building with The Keating. I do not mind outside noise, but the music in the bar did not stop until after 2 am. Not good for two parents with a young child. When my husband went down to talk to the manager about switching rooms, there was some hesitation to help us. Eventually we were moved to a different room, but only after a couple of hours of waiting to see what could be done. Our second room was much quieter than the first. Overall, we probably won't be staying at The Keating again. It is too modern for what we need right now as a family.

One problem is that they should wire up the entire system - living room and bedroom together, so one can play music throughout the suite. You cannot also play a dvd in the bedroom but the on demand movies make that redundant to a certain extent. One suggestion to the hotel would be to provide a written manual next to the sound system so that guests understand how to operate it! Front desk was extremely helpful and even showed us to our room and offered to help with everything. They were also quick in addressing any issues.

I can say we will NEVER stay again. I expected so much more since I had heard some good things about this hotel. My first impressing was that the lobby was the smallest I had ever seen. My husband and I went to San Diego for the weekend with my Brother and Sister-in-law for her birthday. We picked the Keating because they had a great deal of 30% off if you book 2 nights. When my sis-in-law booked the room she picked the least expensive room, but stated it was for her birthday. When I booked I upgraded the room for a better view. We checked in together and they upgraded her to the same kind of room as mine, but on the penthouse level since it was her birthday. When I mentioned we were all together and maybe we could ride on her birthday coat tails to the same level they just laughed as if I was joking! I brushed it off and we were put on the third floor with a view of the city. The rooms are industrial looking, but I knew that from the pictures. Concrete floors and brick walls. What I didn't know was that the bathroom is not in a separate room. Only the toilet is private. The shower is in the bedroom with no door so there is no privacy and it is cold when you turn off the water. Most likely due to the concrete floors. Once in our room I noticed it was hot so I turned up the air, but it didn't seem to work. The bellboy told us to give it 5 minutes to cool off. It never cooled off. I tried to call the desk, but the phone was busy for 15 minutes. I tried to iron my clothes, but the iron wouldn't work. I called the main number from my cel phone and got through to the desk. The same bellboy came with the new iron and asked if I had put water in the iron first. Since when do you have to put water in the iron in order for it to work??!! It's not a steamer! Anyway, he put water in the new one and said to give it 5 minutes to warm up. I though, \"What is with this kid and his 5 minutes?\" I asked about the phone being busy and was told they had been very busy up front. I waited for the iron to heat. The light was on, but no heat. My husband pressed the \"settings\" button, the light went off, and it worked!! Shouldn't they have been able to tell me that?! We went to dinner and out to the clubs (the location is perfect). Upon return, the room was still hot. I called the desk, but the phone was busy! Still??? I guessed there must be something wrong with our phone. I traveled downstairs to the front desk and was told the hotel was green so the air turns back on with a sensor when you enter the room. I told her it never got cool earlier and we had currently been in the room over 5 minutes. They found another room, on the penthouse level. However, the room was smaller with a view of the taller building next door that was almost close enough to touch! When I asked about a view room they said they had one across the hall, but it was even smaller. At this point it was already 2:30 in the morning, the room was cool and it was quiet. The city side is very noisy since the building is old and so are the windows. So, we stayed put. I went to use the universal charging station in the room to finish charging my iphone, but that was the only broken plug! I was given alot excuses that irritated me and no one ever offered to reduce my room rate since I was downgraded to a view of a wall and alley because their air and phone was broken. When I checked out I waited for someone to ask if I enjoyed my stay or if everything was okay, but no one did. I'm not one to complain too much, but I am a regular weekend traveler, who will not be a returning customer when dissatisfied.

Furthermore he was unsure as to why I would receive a busy signal, as the phones are monitored around the clock. He further went on to say for me to reach a busy signal for over an hour is unacceptable (way to validate the customer!!!) and that he was currently investigating what happened. Turned out that during that evening there was a phone outage in the area for approximately 2 hours. Christos extendedy an invitation to come check-out the Keating and to please contact him directly for my reservation for a complimentary upgrade to the Keatings penthouse level. I stuck with my instincts, & friends assurance, & booked a room. My sister arrived at the Keating sat afternoon March 13th and was wonderfully surprised with the penthouse!

I like that. Since the hotel is so small. the staff gets to know you quite quickly, and they all seemed to be very nice and helpful. The bed was one of the most comfortable I've slept in. Fabulous. Okay, so here goes the negative. At night it is extremely noisy due to the fabulous location near all the bars coupled with the fact that it is an old building with really old windows that do almost nothing to filter out the noise. We were kept up by partiers, sirens, horns, and at 4:20 am by workers power washing the sidewalks. I recommend earplugs and this could have been easily remedied. I think the hotel should put earplugs in each room. Nice touch. The bathroom is not a great one if you are in a new relationship and not completely comfortable with one another. Toilet room doesn't completely shut and you can hear everything that goes on in there, if you know what I mean. Shower doesn't have a door and the water did not get hot enough.

I walked over to another lounge/ club right across the street which had a line 20 times longer and it took no more than 5 minutes to get let in (now I see why every night I walked by the hotels lounge there were more employees than customers waiting) the next morning I mentioned this incident to the same manager that was there when I checked in and all she had to say was \" I do apologize I will talk to the lounge manager\" which made me wonder if that would solve anything. I saw her a few more times that day and she never followed up with me not once. Once again I felt like no one in management cared. The front desk employees showed more concern than anyone else (which is really sad). Anyways the last thing I experienced was a roach walking around in my room when I came home from a long day at the zoo. I know it is downtown however I wonder how many other times a guest has encountered this problem? It disgusted me in every way shape and form, thank god that it was my last night there because I probably would have gone to another hotel because I felt like there were bugs crawling on me the whole time. I just dont understand why such a nice hotel would offer such bad service usually you get it from the employees not management? You can totally tell that the manager has not been in the business long enough to run a hotel. I hope she is not the only person making executive decisions. With all this being said as I have read other reviews im not the only one who has experienced horrible things at this hotel. If things ever change around there please advertise it so I can give you guys another shot I truly think that this place can be a wonderful place to stay and enjoy a vacation...

With that comes noise and crowds of people, but the U.S. Grant, Ivy, and Sofia all have similar problems (or worse). As for the hotel itself, the hotel is uber cool (designed by Ferrari designer Pininfarina), with custom designed furniture and room elements in each room and Bang & Olufsen electronics. Rooms are comfortable but spartan, as would befit a Pininfarina remake of a hotel built in 1890. The bed was one of the best I have ever experienced in a hotel. The room floor was painted concrete, and the shower was exposed (with no curtain - by design), but the girlfriend and I found the room to be both comfortable and charming. As would befit a 4 star hotel, the hotel staff was tremendous - eager to help and extremely responsive. We got extremely accurate recommendations on local restaurants and watering holes. The downstairs bar (Minus One) is a nice perk of the Hotel, as admission is guaranteed to guests and the bar turns out to be one of the \"go to\" spots late night (after 1 a.m.), after other Gaslamp establishments go to last call.

My husband and I are not in denial that we are 'hotel snobs', so The Keating seemed like a natural choice for our weekend trip to San Diego. I was both anxious and excited to experience the sophisticated service and amenities boasted on the hotel website and literature. Unfortunately, when we arrived at the hotel we were advised that our room would not be ready for 3 hours, so we checked our bags and went off to explore the city. When we returned 3 hours later, we sat waiting for 15 minutes while another guest checked in and were completely ignored by the other desk staff. When we were finally approached to check into the hotel, we were advised of the 'unfortunate news' that they were unable to fulfill our confirmed reservation, but would guarantee an upgraded room the following night. When I opened the envelope containing our alternate arangements, they were sending us to the Comfort Inn down the street!!! I could not have been more insulted. My husband and I were furious, but were repeatedly told that there was nothing more that could be done. When I asked the reason for being relocated, we were told that the prior evenings guests simply refused to leave! I also asked why we were not told of this 3 hours prior when we first arrived and why the guests who were at the desk when we returned were able to check in and no answers were given to my inquiries. I advised the desk staff that the accomodations they were attempting to provide us were not acceptable and I was again told that there were no other options and that there were simply no reservations in the downtown area available. When I demanded my reservation canceled and my money returned, suddenly there was another option (proving the staff to have lied) available and we were sent to the Westgate which was a few blocks away. The Keating staff expected us to walk to the new hotel with all of our luggage in tow to the new hotel. The Westgate was absolutely lovely. The service was top notch and the room was stunningly beautiful! When we returned to The Keating the next day, our room was not ready. We checked our bags and went out for the day. When we returned we were escorted to our room and received personalized check in service. The room was beautiful. We were upgraded to a room with a jacuzzi tub, which was a nice touch. The bed was one of the most comfortable I have ever slept in. We did not receive the personalized mini bar or turndown service, which are boasted in The Keating literature. The espresso bar is nice, but there is no cream provided. The shower is lovely, but it does leak out onto the floor as there are no doors. That really wasn't a big deal. The floors are finished concrete so there was no danger of slipping. Later in the evening, I called the front desk to inquire about having some ice delivered to the room. An hour later, I was still waiting for the ice. I walked down to the front desk and my ice was sitting there melted next to the desk clerk. I took it up to my room myself. No apology was offered for the delay or the inconvenience. That same evening, I called the front desk to ask for napkins and was told that they would be delivered to my room. I didn't hold my breath and it is a good thing as they were not delivered until 45 minutes later. The noise level is very high, as the other reviews state. Having already read some of the reviews of this hotel, I was somewhat prepared for it. There are earplugs provided in the room. Overall, the hotel itself was georgeous, but I was sincerely unable to enjoy myself as a result of the horrible service I received. I feel that my weekend away was ruined by the Keating staff. The hotel staff are very young and inexperienced. They are just simply incapable of offering the kind of service that the hotel advertises.

The room design definitely had its flaws which included an amazing shower that leaked all over the floor, and a misplaced plasma that blocked the washroom, but was beautiful nonetheless.

After calling the manager we were told that there was nothing she could do before talking to accounting, AND after waiting for her to call us back....well, we are still waiting.

Upon arrival, each person was greated curbside, by their names even, by the friendly Keating staff. Immediately their luggage was taken to their rooms while they checked them in, and from there it only got better. These VIP's are used to fine hotels and service, yet almost everyone from our group commented that the service was outstanding and attention to detail - impecable. It was like nothing they had experienced before, above and beyond in fact. The management and concierge service was beyond expectations as well. Prior to heading out for dinner and after a long day of meetings, our group wanted to have a drink. The manager went so far as to open the semi-private club (Minus 1, which is located downstairs in the Keating) on a day it's normally closed, for an hour just for us! Besides recommending decadent restaurants in the area for dinner, they went the extra mile and even walked us there so we wouldn't get lost and entertained us along the way. Whenever a minor problem would arise, they immediately would handle it and be solved to our satisfaction. I loved the Keating as did the majority of our group. It's very sleak, sexy and modern so it may not be everyone's taste but it worth a stay without question! As for those who complained of the noise in these reviews; during the week while we were there it was pretty quiet. If it does get loud, the Keating provides ear plugs and an eye mask in the rooms ammenities to help you sleep. But the GasLamp district is a hub of activity and energy, noise is to expected. The nightlife is outstanding in that neighborhood and beckons to be enjoyed. So perhaps if it does get loud on weekends there, I suggest you go out, have a few glasses of wine, soak up the vitality of the area, then go back to your room and put in the earplugs.

Having stayed in some exceptional hotels around the world, I was at first impressed by the modernish, european-ish look of the hotel. But look harder, and it begins to feel like an impression of a european boutique hotel. Not sure if this makes sense, but one is left with the feeling that the hotel is trying waaaaay to hard to be different. The staff could not be more accomodating... very helpful from reservation to check in. Wonderful all aroud. Sounds great, right? What's the problem? The problem is that the hotel is EASILY the LOUDEST hotel I have ever stayed at. The Junior suite we were in was directly above a club that seemed to go on all night long. The bed (a very comfy bed, mind you) was literally bumping along in time to the bass and drums below. (at one point, the band broke into \"Shout!\"... I thought I was going to pass out on the \"Little bit louder now!\" call and response). Also, the rooms all face the street as far as I can see, and the Gaslamp is SO LOUD at all hours. Good luck sleeping. And since the building is a historical building, they can't put sound proof windows in (I was told). I cant stress to you HOW LOUD THE NIGHT WAS.... I sound like my parents complaining that 'those whippersnappers were up all night...' but that is what it was like. Neither my wife nor I slept more than two hours, give or take. The rooms provide noise machines for your convenience, but that's like turning on the shower to cover up for the cheers from the Superbowl. Terrible, terrible, terrible... And to add insult to injury, upon complaining to the management, the response I got was: \"Well, this is the Gaslamp. It does get loud.\" No apologies, no nothing. For the price we paid, this was waaaay more than insulting. Ive stayed at MANY other hotels in the Gaslamp and NEVER had this problem. So... if you're going to San Diego and have to stay in the Gaslamp, do yourself a favor. Go to the U.S. Grant or any of the other fine, yet not all tricked out hotels in the area.

Sure, it looks amazing and can be fun, but the looks only go so far when it's too loud and the atmosphere sucks. The Keating is minimalist to the extreme. I'm the type of person that loves everything modern; stainless anything and everything is my style, but when paying $300+ a night I at least expect a separate bathroom, a shower with doors, perhaps a bath tub, carpeting (not painted cement floors!), and at the very least more than single-pane windows (ESPECIALLY when you are in the middle of the nightclub district). This is the first and only hotel that I will say I spent more hours lying awake than I did sleeping. I went to bed at 11pm, but due to the constant and extremely loud (so loud you can hardly hear your own thoughts) noise outside from cars, drunk people and the band that was playing directly four floors below our room. Finally I believe I fell asleep sometime around midnight. I was then woke up at 2 am to the sounds of people screaming in horror \"STOP... DON'T DO IT!\" I ran to the window to see two girls punching each other and chasing each other around with a crowd of at least 50 people watching and cheering. Keep in mind this isn't happening way down the street, it is DIRECTLY outside our window. After almost 10 minutes the police finally arrive, at this point the girls have chased each other into the streets and almost caused multiple accidents. Then an ambulance arrives and takes one girl away. I'm not sure whether the girl was that badly hurt from the fight, got hit by a car, or what. And, this wasn't just a rare occurence. The hotel staff informed us that just the night before there was another fight directly outside the hotel with two girls beating each other with high heels. After all this excitement I finally got back to sleep at about 3:30am. I woke up at 8am to the sounds of cars outside and soon after that housekeeping was sure to come by. At check-out the hotel then tried to charge me for use of some lounge, which I had never even heard of let alone spent money at. After some griping they removed the $100 charge. And, I should also mention NOT to use a credit card if you dare choose to stay at the hotel. Apparently they have some issues with their credit card machine because I used my credit card to check-in and everything seemed to be fine at first until they called the room at 11pm (and got me out of bed) to come downstairs to give them another form of payment because it would not work. I know for a fact that it was not an issue with my card because I called my credit card company and they had no problems, and furthermore I used that same credit card three times the next day without any problems. I DO NOT recommend The Keating. There are so many other nice hotels to stay at. I had stayed at the Holiday Inn on the Bay the night before and it was a MUCH better hotel even if it wasn't as \"hip and modern\" as this one; at least the Holiday Inn knows not to have single-pane windows.", "Date": "June 30, 2007"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "The Keating Hotel by Pininfarina", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g60750-d623586-Reviews-The_Keating_Hotel_by_Pininfarina-San_Diego_California.html", "Price": "$161 - $721*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">432 F Street</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">San Diego</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">CA</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">92101</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "623586", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/0d/84/0d84932a4ee3c9a503513b73325cd3693large.jpg"}}
