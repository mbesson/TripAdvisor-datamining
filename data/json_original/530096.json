Great roof top pool. Overall the hotel was of a good standard, in a good location (10 minutes by metro to the centre and metro station 5 mins walk from hotel) and was great value.

We were also already familiar with the city so the location of the hotel was not a major thing for us because we didn\u2019t need to go sightseeing that much. The hotel is very modern and clean throughout, both rooms and other facilities. On the basement they have a rather well-equipped fitness room and sauna which seemed to be very quiet at least during the day. The room is spacious enough for two with an adequate-sized bathroom which interestingly only has a light glass door (not see-through though) without any lock or sound-proof. Also beware of the probably very eco-friendly tap which spills water all around, mainly on the mirror. Despite the complaints of hard beds in some previous reviews, we found the beds very comfortable and firm enough for a good night\u2019s sleep. Our room was located on the fifth floor with views to both Torre Agaba and Sagrada Familia, very small windows but it was a major advantage that you could open them because the room was very hot at times, probably no air conditioning working during winter. Soundproof between rooms and the corridor is terrible, luckily there were noisy neighbors chatting in the corridor only one night. We had a room only \u2013deal but if you have a mas-card, you get 50% discount of the breakfast so we had that every morning. The breakfast buffet itself is really good and worth the price - fresh food, great variety, quick replenishments but we found the service in the breakfast room a bit rude and unequal because the businessmen in their suits and native Spanish speakers were always asked whether they liked to have coffee brought to their table while other breakfast guests needed to get their coffee from the machine. If you prefer to drink tea, prepare for luke-warm water in a huge pot. The lack of smiles on the staff\u2019s faces did not occur only in the breakfast room, the same went for most of the reception staff. They weren\u2019t rude but didn\u2019t bother to tell anything extra or even apologize for their mistake when they accidentally charged for too many breakfasts while checking out. There has been much debate on the location of the hotel and it really is quite remote and the deserted surroundings are not the nicest to walk in at night. Selva de Mar metro station is about 10 mins walk from the hotel and close to the station is also a tram stop for line T4. The closest restaurants are in a big shopping centre called Diagonal Mar, a 10 mins walk from the hotel to another direction and there you can plenty of them, great variety too. The shops in Diagonal Mar, including a huge supermarket Alcampo are open till 10 pm Mon-Sat and also open on Sundays. All in all, for the price we paid we were happy with the hotel but if you are not a regular visitor in Barcelona and would like to do sightseeing, the location is not ideal. Next time we could be looking for a hotel near Diagonal Mar and the congress centre in order to be little closer to the metro and avoid the deserted streets around the hotel.", "Date": "February 26, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "london", "Title": "\u201cQuiet location, abit further out from city but nice and quiet\u201d", "Author": "jenny h", "ReviewID": "UR124866262", "Content": "Visited for my birthday weekend, hotel is slightly out of the area to the city.

So I'm leaping to this hotel's defence! When we booked it was through Lastminute's top secret hotels deal, and we booked the Vincci Maritimo. When we arrived late at night we were told our room had been double booked, and would we mind going to the sister hotel? Course we said we were fine with that, and what a great thing it was! I loved the shape of it, the room was modern, bright and with its clean lines had a really cosmopolitan feel about it. LOVED the airy lobby and reception area, and actually thought the location was OK. Condal Mar is an industrial area, but with the tram stop less than a ten minute stroll away, it wasn't so bad. The mall close to the stop is also very convenient if you just want an informal dinner. And make sure you visit the supermarket there - I've never seen so much space dedicated to parma ham and salami in my life! If I was able to go back to Barcelona now, I would book this place in an instant. It's great value, has a pool and is close enough to the action to make it a decent option.

Also, one tiny bar of soap and one sponge for 2 people is unacceptable. It may sound like I an whining, but for a 4 star hotel this is not great service.

The hotel has a very smart reception with very friendly and helpful staff who explained clearly what there was to do and where the nearest metro station was. Loved the design of the hotel too which was modern. The hotel is 15 to 20 minutes from the city centre by Metro and the price reflects this. On reflection we would have preferred to pay a bit more and stay more central. Our eighth floor room was spacious and modern. It looked impressive at first though on closer look not everything was as good as it looked. There was no kettle or tea or coffee provided unlike in almost every other hotel I have stayed in. I felt for the price it should have been included. The television was not working either. Thankfully we did not really need the television as we were out for much of the day and night but if a television is to be included with the room it should be expected to work. There were also a few other problems. The safe did not work plus the sink had a crack and a minor leak. Shower gel and shampoo was an all in one combo and we would have preferred separate toiletries. The walls were also pretty slim and we could hear the couple next door clearly. The wi-fi is also not free though I understand from the hotel staff that it may become free early next year. However, worst of all was my bed. I have stayed in hotels, hostels, Bed and Breakfasts and people's couches around the world and I can honestly say it was the worst bed I have ever slept in. The mattress was far too hard and killed my back. My first night was pretty sleepless. I hope I never have to experience those beds again. The main purpose of a hotel room is to provide a good night's sleep so the hotel failed on that count. On the plus side the breakfast was amazing. Absolutely delicious and plentiful. The staff were brilliant and very friendly. Loved the croissants in particular. Very impressed. Good staff and delicious breakfast but too many problems too so I would not stay there again. Barcelona is an amazing city and I will be back for sure but I will choose another hotel and one closer to the centre.

The hotel is not in the centre of town, however if it was it would be twice as much and so you have to make a decision as to what is important to you.

Barcelona is an expensive city and so if you want to be in the centre then you will pay for the priviledge. The hotel is reasonably well presented, the staff are courteous and efficient and the buffet breakfast is very good. I was slightly concerned regarding some of the negative reviews, however having returned from a week\u2019s stay all I can conclude is that the earlier reviewers must have had some slightly unrealistic expectations.

One great thing about the location of the hotel (which is not miles away from the centre as some people say - we know this because we hired bikes and it is appoximately 2 miles away) was the fact that the Mar Bella beach is a 12 minute easy straight walk away. Selva del Mar also hosts a hilton hotel (2 mins from the beach) and an ENORMOUS shopping centre which doesn't look like one from the outside, but in the inside is packed with great shops and restaurants and a supermarket to stock up on drinks, etc. Back to the hotel, the breakfast was superb, continental and yummy. The rooms were lovely and modern (the finishing very slightly tired but certainly nothing to cry about) and the pool area is great with a good view. Bathroom was lovely, everything worked and generally I do not have a single negative. I always felt safe walking around the area and the tube is a 12 minute walk, but once again if you're silly enough to keep paying out for cabs to and from everywhere then this place isn't for you!

I was in a party of six. We knew in advance about the location of the hotel, so this was not a surprise. The hotel is situated outside Barcelona town centre, on the L4 sub way line, getting off at Selva de Mar. The station is about a 10 minute walk from the hotel. Check in was fine, no issues there. The room was excellent. Very stylish. The air conditioning worked fine and wasn't too noisy. The bathroom glass doors, that have been mentioned in previous reports were smoked over, so no one walking past could see in. Plenty of hot water, but it did change temperature a little while showering, but not to hot that it would burn ! No tea or coffee making facilities in the room, but there was a mini bar. Free safe available in room, worked by credit card. I didn't have breakfast, but my friends did, they stated it was excellent and they paid about 9 Euros, per sitting. I used the gym on one occasion, while my friends were having breakfast. There we to jogging/ walking machines, two cycle machines and one rowing machine. All seemed to be working. The sauna was not on when I used the gym. Unfortunately the next day (A Saturday), the gym wasn't open, so I question this at reception and was told it didn't open until 09.00, which was very disappointing as I wished to exercise before flying home, taxi booked at 09.30. I'm not to sure why they didn't open the gym until 09.00, but as this was a big let down on my part. I was able to take beer from the downstairs bar onto the room terrace, so no problems there. The pool area and terrace was well laid out, plenty of chairs and sun loungers to use. 'Piped' music by the pool, that appeared to be on all day, which personally I found quite annoying, The views from the terrace, looking into Barcelona Centre were stunning, particularly at night. The views a bit more local showed the area to be run down and in need of development/ improvement. The scrap yard was just over the road, with gypsy type people living out of vans on the kerb side. We had no issues with these people as they kept themselves to themselves, but we did walk down an alternative street to avoid them. Again we knew the area the hotel was in wasn't very glamorous from previous reports, but unfortunately the hotel is situated, where there is nothing around within easy walking distance for a quick beer or meal of any great standard. One restaurant we tried close to the sub way was below average at best, but was that expensive. We tried another out of desperation in the Diagonal Mar Shopping Centre (one of our party had a pulled muscle and could walk too far). This was very poor and quite expensive. Overall, it would be hard to fault the hotel, but it's location and local facilities are very poor to poor at best, which might be a big turn off for people. We assumed the hotel had been built in this area to kick start a re-development of the area, but this hasn't really started yet. Also, watch out for pick pockets in Barcelona, particularly on the underground, we encountered this on three occasions in three days, plus once in a restaurant. We got caught out once, but because we had locked our bag packs, they didn't get away with anything! I found Barcelona very expensive, they are really pricing themselves out and I can only guess that tourists will soon cotton on to these extortionate prices and not come back.

From the moment we arrived the service was awful and the facilites just did not match up to what we would expect at a 4 star hotel. Yes the hotel and rooms look lovey but for us its about the service and being made to feel wellcome which we did not. We wrote a letter of complaint to the hotel and they say it is beacuse there were in a period of transistion and had new systems etc. Well im sorry but I would expect a 4 star hotel to manage the transition better to be honest! Here is a list of the issues we had when we stayed: Request was for twin rooms and we had 1 twin and 1 double Request was for adjoining or rooms near to each other and they were on the same floor but far apart. No food available after 11pm at the hotel so with late arrival were unable to eat, no vending machines even. Bar unstaffed and long wait pretty much every time. On one instance, in the middle of being served, the bar staff went off on another errand and we were left waiting for a further 10mins. Bar shut at 12:00 this is not usual for any hotel bar. No room service Unable to dial other rooms and unable to dial reception from the room to get help. Reception staff were very rude and unhelpful (apart from one guy called Frank) Wi-Fi not working in the room and reception very rude and unhelpful about getting access to internet. Roof Terrace Bar not open as per the advertised facilities. Roof Terrace Area closed until 4pm on the Saturday?! (surely the peak time for the hotel?) Not allowed to take food from the bar onto roof terrace. Overall service was very poor and not what we would expect from a 4 star hotel. We asked the room to be put in my colleagues name, so that she could receive calls. This never happened. Issues with the system in checking in, taking breakfast, at bar, due to new systems being installed. This caused further delays.

We got a good deal on last min with the \u201csecret hotel\u201d which worked out at approx \u00a3200. Pros - modern decor and great sized room. I am afraid that\u2019s were it ends. Con's - Hotel name is confusing. Three of the four taxis we used did not have a clue where it was. The hotel is in an industrial area which we found safe and quiet although surely not an ideal place for a hotel!! The staff we encountered were really poor. It took an age to check in (seriously 15 mins). The internet connection/TV was 19 euro\u2019s per 24hrs, without it the TV has virtually no English speaking programmes. I know you don\u2019t go to Barcelona to watch TV but after a day's sight seeing it\u2019s nice to just have it on whilst relaxing and planning evening events. The room had no ironing facilities and did not get cleaned on 1 of the days we were there. This was not due to us being in the room when cleaners came. My partner went to reception to ask for some ice for a bottle of wine and came back with approx 5 cubes of ice and was told he was not allowed any more!!! My partner also cut his foot whilst staying at the hotel, I popped to reception get a plaster to be told they did not have any. On the second to last day of our hol we were up and out early. When we got back the room had been cleaned and we began packing before heading out for dinner as we had an early flight. I soon discovered that my brand new cardigan had gone missing. It literally disappeared!!! It was cream in colour and the hotel staff feel it may have been caught up in the bed linen and taken to be laundered. I am now supposed to be emailing to see if it has been discovered. The cardigan was expensive and will be destroyed after being industrially cleaned!! All in all I would not stay here again or recommend it. The diagonal mar area is lovely. Great beach and shopping, loads of places to eat and Las Ramblas approx 10 mins away. I would really recommend this area if u want to relax, get some sun and dip in and out of the hustle and bustle of Las Ramblas etc", "Date": "August 26, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mays86", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel\u201d", "Author": "Mays86", "ReviewID": "UR72273700", "Content": "Stayed here for four nights on a trip to Barcelona at the start of July. We arrived in a taxi from the airport so had no trouble finding the hotel obviously. At check in I think the staff were training a new colleague so it was a bit slow and were speaking to each other in Spanish a lot but we got our room keys no problem. The room we stayed in, a twin, was nice and clean. The decor was a bit rough around the edges but it had a lovely feel to it, very spacious and lots of wardrobe space (important for us two ladies!) The bathroom was a great size and very clean. The shower and bath worked really well and we had plenty of towels. I requested an extra one during our stay and this was delivered with no trouble. On a couple of days we used the roof terrace to sunbathe. What a place! The tenth floor 360 degree views of Barcelona were stunning. We never used the pool but it looked nice and clean and there were generally staff nearby if you wanted a drink from the bar. The location is one thing that slightly lets the hotel down. It's a good walk from the metro which some people might not like but we didn't mind. It gave us the feel that we were out and about exploring a 'hidden' part of Barcelona and there was a great cafe nearby where we had 2 euro coffee and croissant every morning - a price I don't think you'd find right in the centre of town! Similarly, a hotel of this design and standard would be able to triple their prices in a central location so for me it was well worth doing an extra bit of travelling in order to stay so comfortably. One criticism was that due to the hot hot weather of July, we decided to leave a room key in the holder next to the door which powers the electricity/air con. We arrived back to find the cleaner had the key out and handed it back to reception, automatically cutting off the air conditioning. I don't know if this was to save electricity but we found it uncomfortable arriving back to a stuffy room after spending all day melting in the heat outside! We never had the breakfast or used the room service. It was always easy to get into the hotel no matter what time we arrived back late at night. Some people have commented on the 'area' the hotel was in perhaps being unsafe, we walked through it late at night a couple of times and never saw anything dodgy or had any real reason to fear for our safety! If I were to come back to Barcelona I would happily stay at the hotel again. However I would not ask them to phone us a taxi to the airport- the drivers levy a 15 euro charge for this on top of your 30+ euro fare, completely cleaning us out, saying this was the call out fee. It would have been kind of the staff to tell us this at the time, as there are plenty of cabs to be hailed on the Diagonal Mar.

When we eventually did read some, we were a bit apprehensive about its location, in terms of convenience and \"dodginess.\" Both of these factors depend on your expectations. If you want to be slap-bang in the middle of the city, don't book it. If you want to be in a thriving, beautiful setting, don't book it. For the price we paid, (less than \u00a3160 for three nights) we were happy to be five minutes' walk from the Selva de Mar Metro station and no more than fifteen minutes' Metro journey from most of the main sights. The Metro service in Barcelona is outstanding and it is near-enough impossible to get lost, though you really do have to keep your hands on your belongings. The surrounding area, as other reviews suggest, can be a little unnerving, with crowds of people on the corners drinking and shouting. But we certainly never felt in any real danger, and the walk back to the hotel is far shorter than many reviews on here suggest. The hotel itself was very impressive. It seems to just appear in front of you as you approach and first impressions are very good. The helpful staff (particularly a man by the name of Frank), clean, spacious rooms, king-size, comfortable bed, striking, modern interior and excellent breakfast deliver on these high standards. One small problem is the odd notion of having glass doors to the bathroom. This seems to me like suicide when you're running a hotel. Not all guests will be couples, and even those couples (in most cases) won't particularly want to see each other sitting on the toilet. A truly bizarre design feature, which could potentially cost them custom. Maybe Tryp will address this. We only briefly visited the pool/bar area on the roof one day, but it was a bit too busy. We were then both victims of pick-pockets on the last night of our trip (far from the hotel, I should add), so didn't have time to visit it in the evening as planned. But it looked like a lovely feature and we certainly would have spent more time there had we stayed at the hotel longer. Overall, I might not recommend the hotel to everyone. If they could drag it down the road to a livelier area, sort the bathroom doors out, throw in some tea and coffee facilities and free internet connection (though this didn't particularly interest us), I wouldn't hesitate - in fact they could have a five-star hotel.

The food served was okay however I was expecting a higher standard than what I received, the style of the restaurant out ways the quality of food served, the buffet breakfast at 10 Euro however is very good value.

The bathroom was very nice and the shower was excellent. The breakfast was excellent with lots of different breads, cakes, fruit to choose from. The staff on arrival were a bit unhelpful (i.e. just idly chatting behind the counter while we waited to be checked in) and when we were told we couldn't check in as we were too early it took 10 minutes to get somebody to serve us a drink even though the bar was supposed to be open and when she did serve us she made it feel as though we were inconveniencing her. The hotel is located a bit out of the centre (20 mins by tube to the centre) and is surrounded by factories and some old housing estates. Although these didn't look particularly nice there was no sign to us as to whether it is a bad area, we thought it is just dated. We walked back from the metro station each night and felt safe although we did always walk together. I was going to give the hotel 4 as we knew about the location before we booked the hotel but the friendliness of the staff (although this tends to be generally OK from looking at other reviews on here) and also the lack of maintenance in the room made us drop a mark.

For the travel who like the contemporary design and style, this place is the spot. However, there are a few down sides. First of all, the hallways are extremely dark. You need a few seconds to adapt once you get off the elavators. I also think the quality of furniture used in the rooms look better than they actually are. Top notch for the looks but the quality and practical usage of the chairs and closet are terrible. If you spend only a few hours duing the day in the room this will not be a problem. There is no way you can unwind in the room. The rooms are not that well insulated. You can basically here everything going on in the rooms beside as well as above you. There was a baby in the room right next door and kept us up all night. Not to mention a very loud couple upstairs. If you are a light sleeper chances are high you will wake up. The bathroom is stylish. Not practical at all though. The sink will have stains all over it after the first use. the whole place looks great if you do not use it. The terrace and the pool upstairs is cool but again not practical at all due to the wind. Location is a bit off too. unless you really need to be in the area, I would not recommend staying in this side of town. It would be a 10\u20ac cab ride to the heart of the activities regardless of the part of town. The subway station is a good 15minutes walk, after which you will ride another 15-20 minutes to reach the Rambla area.

We found the Vincci Condal Mar to be an upscale hotel, with elegant new rooms, good staff, but in not such a good location. We stayed in a standard double room, which included two double beds, a work desk, a bar fridge, a couple of cupboards, a widescreen TV, an air conditioner and heater, an in room safe and a stylish new bathroom including a toilet, a bidet, sink and bath/shower. The room was pretty luxurious and had the little extras (eg. bath gel, shower caps, etc) that you would hope for in a stylish hotel. The room was very comfortable and clean. The shower was easily controlled in terms of temperature and had good water pressure. The hotel does offer a mini bar, internet and in-room movies, but all were rather expensive. My traveling companion visited the gym during our stay and reported that it was simply a couple of treadmills predominately. The roof included an outdoor pool and some good views. Unfortunately, the pool was closed during our stay, after all it was winter. Sitting by the pool having a look at the view and hearing the water crash from the beach would probably be rather refreshing on a hot summer\u2019s day, but I don\u2019t know that for sure. In terms of location, my mate and I were trying to decide between this hotel and the Vincci Maritimo Barcelona hotel which is part of the Vincci chain. We chose this hotel as it had the fitness center which my traveling companion wanted. Honestly, during winter especially, I would have preferred to stay at the Maritimo Barcelona as it was a 1 minute walk from the Selva De Mar train station and just over the road from the Diagonal Mar shopping center. The Vincci Condal Mar is further north, away from the beach area, and is about a 5 to 10 minute walk from the nearest train station, Selva De Mar, and about the same from the shopping center. This made the Vincci Condal Mar stand out in terms of its location. It really is just planted in almost a no mans zone, near nothing much. It is also about a 20 euro cab ride from the Estacio de Franca train station (one of the international train stations). In terms of time it takes to get into the city via train, from my memory, it\u2019s not the 30 minutes that some people are reporting. Much closer to 15 or even 10 minutes. The restaurant or bar at the hotel appeared rather expensive, and so we never ate or had a drink at the hotel. Instead we had a couple of meals at the Diagonal Mar food court area where you can find different cuisines to suit your tastes. The other annoyance we had with the hotel was the fact that after asking for separate double beds, we got to our room to find two double beds pushed up against one another. Now, being two guys, it\u2019s not the most comfortable thing having to sleep in such a close proximity to one another. But this again, was simply an annoyance and I\u2019m sure we could have separated the beds a little if we could have been bothered. We booked this hotel through Expedia which offered a very decent rate. I\u2019ve attached a couple of pictures, hopefully helping those unsure of whether to stay here or not. The hotel was very comfortable and had nice views and decent staff members. Unfortunately, the location really lets the hotel down, and so I\u2019d definitely try to book into the Vincci Maritimo Barcelona hotel over this hotel, for convenience purposes. If I couldn\u2019t get a room at the Maritimo, then I\u2019d be happy enough to stay once again, at the trendy Vincci Condal Mar.", "Date": "February 18, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201cSet Your Expectations Right\u201d", "Author": "DawnCK", "ReviewID": "UR22314877", "Content": "The hotel itself is a modern, aesthetically interesting building. Throughout our 4-night stay there, we are of the impression that the management of this property are doing what they need to do to maintain the bare essentials of the building.

For example, the seating in the lobby looked worn, one wall in our room was soiled, lamps looked tired. The place essentially looked unloved. We also felt that the staff, whilst professional and efficient, were not hospitable. They did not do anything to make guests feel welcomed -- everyone was polite but rather impersonal. This hotel would appear to cater to business travellers who would have no compunction with travelling by taxi to and from the hotel. It is, otherwise, a 5- to 10-minute walk to the nearest Metro or tram station. It is not that bad but leisure tourists would probably find this a rather inconvenient place to lodge. On the plus side, the staff were efficient. On our second night, we discovered that there was a problem with the plumbing -- there was no cold (?!) water.

The japanese 'fusion' restaurant is VERY expensive for what you get. the food was good but there was very little. i had three courses (max available) and was still hungry 2.

I know, we should have put it in the safe but it was stolen just the same. I've stayed in some dodgy quarters in Barcelona but never knowingly had stuff stolen from me before but I guess there is always a first time. So, my advice would be, stay somewhere else. Stay central and save on cab fees. Ask yourself - why does this hotel have lots of rooms free in busy periods when the rest of Barcelona is jam packed?", "Date": "March 24, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Durham, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cmodern through and through\u201d", "Author": "ne-wanderingfree", "ReviewID": "UR11328399", "Content": "Extremely attracted by low price and photographs of hotel.

It seemed extremely attractive, both in terms of price and appearence and guess what; it is! The rooms are fantastically modern but not in the sense of them being overpoweringly 'whiter than white' and they provide all the comforts of a top class hotel. As students we wanted to stay in the nicest accomodation we could afford without frittering away our budget on what was basically a bed for the night. With the Vincci being a little outside of Barcelona it was the perfect dichotomy for us; cheap and 4-star! The area (as I remember being commented on before) is a little rough round the edges and I will admit to feeling a little threatend when we first stepped off the metro in the dead of night (my advise; metro by day, taxi by night; simply for piece of mind!) However despite this we were soon accosted by a friendly Catalan whose little English was even worse than my little Spanish but who still tried his best to give us directions to the hotel. We did, however, stil end up lost as the hotel is in the middle of surrounding building works and not easy to find in the dark! However, in the day it is an easy walk to the metro station and a short ride into town. By night the most expensive taxi we paid for was about 15euros - easily worth paying considering the saving on the hotel! The staff were excellent to us but then I attempted (as i do on every trip I've been on) to converse mainly in their language or at least to simply say 'hello' 'good-night' etc. I did observe a manager give a rather rude response and angry glare at a late-arriving Australian who announced himself with a 'g'day mate' but then my personal opinion is he was well within his rights to do much more than give him the evil eye! If you are the sort of person who expects staff in hotels in major cities to speak excellent English 100% of the time though and think this is part of what you pay for to stay in an unpmaket hotel then this is probably not the place for you! However this is the only gripe I would suggest you COULD have about the place. We did not eat the food but it looked fantastic. If money is no option to you then you may wish to stay in central Barcelona and forgoe the extra transport but then what's the point in that when you could stay in luxury, save some money and trade living on Orwell's doorstep with a simple, comfortable, cheap 10minute metro ride?!

On the bright side, the hotel rooms are very clean and also maintain that cylindrical shape of the hotel, which we thought was very neat. The staff is also courteous and helpful, if asked. It is probably one of the better hotels we have stated at this price range; it\u2019s just a shame about the location. A taxi into the more picturesque parts of the city cost about 12 euros. If you are a tourist who plans to see the city, Barri Goti, Gaudi architecture, and Las Ramblas, you are better off staying closer towards the center of town. If you are a business traveler attending a conference in the Forum area, you are still better off finding a hotel closer to the Diagonal Mar Shopping area, as this hotel is nearly one mile away from the Forum area.

There are many businesses there too so the area is not filled with tons of people but the streets are clean, well light, and no danger present. Check in was fast and friendly. Hotel room was interesting. Despite it being a newish hotel, we noticed in our room many things that seemed to be a sign of poor workmanship. We noticed things peeling, parquet floors that were not measured and cut correctly. Too many signs of wear and tear for a new hotel. Also, not that I am a prude but I found the interior space poorly planned especially the bathroom walls. How can you have walls made of clear glass in the bathroom so that everyone else in the room can see you squatting on a toilet seat. No thank you! Room was clean and sufficient but nothing to rave about. Breakfast was mediocre. The head waitress, Bea was aloft and rude. She was too busy critiqing the other staff than analyzing how she operates. She asks us if we want coffee and then we have to wait several minutes because she was busy making some breakfast for someone in the back area. Several people who came in after us were served first.

This is a great hotel for the money, I think it would suit couples and groups more than families but for the price I would recommend it to all.", "Date": "July 24, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Solihull, England", "Title": "\u201cOK, but not great\u201d", "Author": "orange_traveller", "ReviewID": "UR5493635", "Content": "The hotel has a lovely lobby and magnificent lights hanging from the ceiling, which gives an overall good first impression. The rooms are above average with a HUGE bed, nice TV and bathroom. The only downside is there is only one English channel - but still, not a big thing unless you are planning to stay in the room all day! The selection of room service is not great, and neither is the lunch-time option in the restaraunt, but the food you do get is excellent. The separate restaraunt \"Takenmori\" has amazing food, although quite expensive; about \u20ac80 for a meal for two! It is well worth it though. The bar in the lobby also shuts at 11 so we didn't even get a chance to try it! One major drawback is the size of the pool - absolutely tiny and not heated. The views from the roof are quite spectacular, especially at night, however, they do shut the terrace round about 10.30 - 11, so you don't get to see much of them. The staff at the hotel, although being far from rude and unhelpful, are quite unfriendly and speak very little english. Another big drawback is the location of the hotel, however it only costs round about \u20ac20-30 to / from the airport which is quite reasonable and about \u20ac10 into Las Ramblas. However, if you were staying in a city-centre hotel of the same quality i expect the prices would be a lot higher. Although the area is a little run-down, you feel quite safe walking around there - even at night. About a 10 minute walk away is a really good shopping centre with a massive supermarket and anything else you could possibly need. All in all, its ok, nothing special but definetely good value for money.", "Date": "July 21, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Glasgow", "Title": "\u201cAverage stay\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5432993", "Content": "I stayed at Vincci Condal Mar for 6 nights in June 06. The Hotel is fine well kept and the Reception and Rooms modern Air conditioned and spotless, the Buffet breakfast was fine and offered a reasonable variety. That is the better parts of the review, the Hotel service is quite poor getting served at the rooftop Pool (which is mobbed if more than ten people are at it ) Bar is almost impossible as it gets staffed for about 5 mins every Hr, do not get fooled by the website claim of view the city by night as the rooftop gets shut just as darkness descends?. The area is largely made up of building yards/sites and what appears to be drab cheap maisonette style housing and areas of waste ground, travelling to city centre is not too bad and can be acheived by Tram, Metro or by taxi ( 12 - 15 Euro). Beware of short taxi rides IE from Metro stop to hotel as some drivers wont take the Hire if its not worth their while!!. There is absolutely nothing in the immediate area for a tourist however a 15 Min walk will take you to Diagonal Mar shoping Mall which has a really good array of eating and drinking establishments and some light entertainment EG 10 pin bowling. Overall the Hotel is probably worth going to as its price is quite attractive but the Hotel itself offers very little in the way of features or services, bear this in mind if you have plans for a night at the hotel itself.", "Date": "July 6, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ireland", "Title": "\u201cVery nice hotel\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5325476", "Content": "Stayed at this hotel for one night, 3rd June 2006.

It is about a five minute walk from the Selva de Mar metro station. No way to get into this station if you are in a wheelchair, just steep steps.

The location is opposite a coffee warehouse and 100 yards from a Gypsy caravan site. The 'shopping centre' referred to as being close by is a sprawl of tenement blocks with occasional tapas bars and barricaded shops amongst them. The hotel is some way from a decent tourist area and seems to be there for mainly visiting businessmen to the local factories/warehouses. The nearest Metro is Selva de Mar on line 4 but for goodness sake don't use the Metro. In 16 hours I was mugged once and subject to a pickpocket theft on the Metro. The Police refused to listen to my reports unless I produced my passport thereby reducing any chance of the offenders being caught. It is apparent that such thefts are commonplace as I found out plain clothes police and security work the centre but there are no warnings to tourists on display in the Metro stations or on the trains. The hotel inself is OK and at most 3 star. The buffet breakfast was excellent. One problem was the shortage of HOT water, it was necessary to leave the taps running for 5-10 minutes before it got hot. The consierge will arrnage taxis to get around but seem to favour the Spanish speakers and yesterday, despite being told our taxi was next, 3 arrived and were given to Spaniards but after 30minutes I managed to flag a stray cab down. Another problem I encountered was taxi drivers never hearing of this hotel. Twice we were taken to a sister hotel, Maritimo, and the drivers were adament this was the only Vincci hotel in Barcerlona. One was extremely offensive and abusive that we dared suggest he was wrong. Take a card with your and write out the complete address. The rooms are modern but a poorly cleaned, just look at the dust on the black surfaces when you arrive, it will still be there when you leave. There is a minibar in the room, no tariff is displayed so don't be fooled into thiniing it is complimentary as they charge 1.6 euros for a small bottle of water. If you fancy a good night out and excellent food visit the area of Port Olympic where good seafood restaurants can provide large meals for about 40 Euros each with drinks.", "Date": "May 20, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cGreat value for money\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5038725", "Content": "We've just returned from a 5 day trip to Barcelona and stayed at this hotel, we all loved it.

This is a beautifully designed hotel, where care and attention has been given to the design from the foyer, upwards. The circular design adds to an intriguing room design, but this doesn't mean the rooms are small by any standards. The room had all the mod cons you would want, except only one 1 English language TV channel (CNN), not that it really mattered to me, but it may to others. The breakfast was a feast, with plenty of variety all for 14 euros. The area outside the hotel was a bit strange as it was away from the hustle and bustle of the city, clearly in the old industrial zone of the city. The area was desolate, but was well lit and you always felt safe walking around in the early hours. The journey from the airport took about 35 mins in a taxi and cost in the region of 28 euros, which wasn't too bad. Alternatively you could take the Aerobus (from the Airport) to Placa Catalyuna and walk (5 mins) to Urquinaona on the L4 (yellow line) and then take the metro from there to Selva De Mar; (you can also take the metro to Catalyuna, but this will mean you need to change which means more walking if you have heavy bags). This will take you around 20-25 mins and will save you some money. The journey on the aerobus is only 3.75 euros and a metro journey single costs only 1 euro (so I'm told). It\u2019s cheaper to get a T10 book which will give you 10 single journeys for around \u20ac7, which is what I did. Even though the hotel is not local, you can get into the centre of Barcelona in around 20-30 mins depending where you go. The bonus is that you do get to stay in a great hotel for less than a usual 4 star hotel in the city.
