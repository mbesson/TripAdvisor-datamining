If you are into the modern/urban culture, don't stay here and go to the east side where things are happening. However, if you are after a bit of Unter den Linden romance, this is the place.

In fact, the staff make you feel as if you are the prince/princess who were born here. I was a lone single female guest but the staff everywhere made me feel totally relaxed, welcomed, protected and happy anywhere I was, even at the beautifully candle-lit bar in the evening where I was the only single person. The style of the hotel is classical-modern. Everything is real, not repro, combined with the highest quality modern pieces. Everything works perfectly and is certainly not one of romantic-but-dusty. My room was super stylish, very comfortable and well appointed with a beautiful bathroom. I was invited to a very important concert at Berlin philharmonie but seriously considered not attending to that and stayed in all night at this place instead. It is only 15-20 minutes taxi ride to the centre of Berlin, but the drive is beautiful and usually one can pick up good information on Turkish/Persian restaurants in town and/or current political situation of Germany. I had to arrange a rental-car at the end of my stay here, but one of the receptionist did absolutely everything for me. He translated and negotiated but also chose insurance options!

This you certainly get with this Schlosshotel which is also part of small LHW (leading hotels of the world). The halls around the main entrance are grandiose and so are the rooms. We had a suite with two seperate rooms with the possibility of putting the kids to bed in the bedroom and spending the time in the \"living room\". The rooms have all the services that you could think of including free mini bar. We had room service two evenings and were in generally satisfied with this. It was not outstanding as you may expect for a hotel in this category, but then again, we were having room service and were not in a restaurant. I am sure that we could have gone to the fine restaurant in the hotel and had a super meal, but with small kids it is more relaxing (for the parents at least) to eat in the room (instead of having the people sitting at the next table staring at you because your son has put half his plate on the table). We went to the pool two times when staying there and more or less had the whole pool area to ourselves. The big pool had a temperature of 29 celcius so we could stay in this for a long time and the small jazussi was expected very hot. The continental breakfast was not lavish, but everything served was high quality. In addition you could order a hot omelettes. Finally, there was the possibility to have sparkling wine if you were in the mood for that. Only two negatives we experienced during our stay were a) some noise in the morning outside our hotel window and b) that I could not get a seat in the main bar Saturday evening. Regarding the former we were offered to move to another room which we declined since we with small kids were up anyway (We had not informed the reception of the noise outside our window, but somehow they must have picked it up). Regarding the latter there was plenty of space in many of the adjacent rooms - just not so cosy - so difficult to complain about.

We chose a room with a reading corner in addition to the desk so that we would have a bit more space. The service in this hotel was excellent. The room was very quiet and the area is very relaxing. It was a nice touch that the minibar was \"free\" (i,.e. included in the price). Breakfast was not included in the price and cost ca. 24 euros more per person. The breakfast was very good with a choice of high quality meats, cheeses, breads etc etc with a chef on hand to make egg-dishes with bacon etc etc and one could get all sorts of coffee/espresso that one desired. It is worth remembering that this hotel is not in the centre of Berlin and the public transport connections are not that great: if you want a city-trip, this is not the right place to stay, if you want to relax in beautiful surroundings, it is the place to stay. The only (minor) downside: we had room service twice we just felt the dishes lacked \"that special something\" (?inspiration?) that one might expect for the price: whilst the quality of the ingredients was very high and the cooking executed at a very high technical level, there was just something missing.

Think twice...\u201d", "Author": "Dopeysnowy", "ReviewID": "UR117702270", "Content": "We chose this hotel simply because of the reviews on Trip Advisor and the fact that the hotel was rated number 1 in Berlin. This just shows the perils of relying on Trip Advisor too much, as it really was a let down. I suggest you think carefully what you are looking for before deciding to book it. The hotel is undeniably grand, has a nice pool and grounds, some interesting history and has some lovely features...but it is let down in a number of ways. Firstly the location. Yes it's undeniably a nice part of town if you're planning on spending your time sat outside in the grounds of your hotel, but if you're going to be sight seeing it really is not the place to be. There is nothing of note in the area, so you really have to get a taxi or the metro everywhere. Given that half the joy of Berlin is the ability to walk to so many places this was disappointing. Secondly, the service. A lot has been talked about the quality of the service and yes many of the staff were very good. But it certainly wasn't all. We arrived in the evening so decided to eat in the hotel restaurant. There was only one other person in there when we arrived (at around 9pm) and when we asked the waitress if they were still serving she looked at her watch, raised her eyebrows and said that she would have to check with the chef. She reappeared and said that we could in a very begrudging manner. Not exactly a warm welcome! She offered us what turned out to be the fine dining menu but it didn't correspond to the menu we had seen in the hotel information in our room, so we were confused. We asked whether there was another menu and the waitress reluctantly gave us what turned out to be the a la carte menu and she then proceeded to tell us in a very condescending manner that people usually didn't order off it because it wasn't fine dining. Looking at the menu I couldn't make any distinction, certainly not in price with main courses around the 30Euro mark. We ordered and later got chatting to another waiter who proceeded to tell us how he hated working at the hotel and couldn't wait to leave...not very reassuring to hear as a guest! By the time we reached the end of our main course we felt completely abandonded in the empty restauarant. Nobody came to refill our glasses or offer more drinks or even dessert, and when we wanted to leave we then had to wait 15 minutes for somebody to deign to appear to allow us to sign the bill! All in all a thoroughly soulless and unimpressive experience!! Thirdly, the room. Our suite was under the eaves and was a bit of an odd design. The decor wasn't exactly shabby chic more just a little worn out! There were some nice touches, the iMac in the living area was great and the wifi was good speed. But the bed was a disaster!! Call me old fashioned but surely one of the most important aspects of any hotel is how good the bed is? The mattress was clearly old, you could feel the springs, but it was also covered with a plastic/rubber mattress protector! Yuck!! This not only made the bed really hot to sleep in but it was also seriously uncomfortable and small. To be honest I'd have sacrificed the iMac for a decent bed any day!! The pillows had also clearly seen better days and were very uncomfortable, plus they were filled (as were the duvets) with feathers of some description. An allergy nightmare for those that suffer from this...and no alternatives appeared to be on offer. The air conditioning had likewise seen better days. We had it on the lowest setting with full fan and were still too hot. We both had a terrible night...not good!! Finally, the bathroom. For a suite I expect a decent size bathroom. It wasn't. It was cramped with only one sink with very litte counter space and the whole thing seemed really dated. I took a shower and when I opened the door when I'd finished the floor was totally flooded (I had closed the door properly before you ask...). I spent the next 5 minutes mopping up the floor with towels...not quite what I'd expect from a 3 star hotel let alone a 5 star one. To put the above comments in perspective we were paying around 350 Euro a night for the room, so this wasn't a cheap stay. We've stayed at luxury hotels around the world and its easy to find yourself getting picky about things, but there were some fundamental failings at this hotel. But the bed was for both of us the biggest problem and neither of us could face another night in it. So regrettably we actually left the hotel earlier than planned and moved into the centre of the city for the rest of our stay, where we had a much more enjoyable time. If you have to go through the inconvenience of moving hotels then I think that sums up why we felt the Schlosshotel such a let down.", "Date": "September 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "san francisco, ca", "Title": "\u201cImpeccable!\u201d", "Author": "sf_travel8", "ReviewID": "UR116996831", "Content": "One of the finest hotels I've stayed in.

Service at reception was excellent, and I was given a tour of the facilities after I unpacked. I kept being told that I was the \"prince of the castle\", and they really made me feel it. The interiors are just breathtaking, which explains why there was a movie crew filming when I arrived. They were in and out without much fuss though, and I was able to view the truly stunning rooms they filmed in. I also understand how Karl Lagerfeld probably did not want the furniture to compete with the rooms. Great contrast of clean lines with grand details. The nice thing is that it's so grand and yet so intimate. You can really stay in any of the grand living rooms reading a book, and not feel strange, the way you would doing that in the lobby of a very large hotel. Everything in the hotel is understated elegance. The room is decorated very well, with high tech amenities. Free mini-bar, free WiFi and Bulgari toiletries. Breakfast service was superb, and dinner at the fine dining restaurant was fantastic. The indoor pool downstairs was beautiful, and befitting of a hotel of this grandeur. The fitness room was a little small though - most likely an afterthought for newer guests. There is also a large garden with lounge chairs. My most memorable time at the hotel was spent lounging in the garden with tea and cake, enjoying the fresh air. The hotel is a bit off the beaten path, and would probably be fine for people with cars or who are fine with taxis the whole time. It's a great part of Berlin to see, as there's nothing touristy about it. There are bikes that you can use for free to explore the really posh neighborhood.

We got this and more from our fantastic stay at the Scholsshotel. The hotel is in a beautiful suburb of Berlin, but is well connected via the S-train (Grunewald station) and there is also a bus stop very close to the hotel. A taxi ride to central Berlin took about 20mins and cost about 15 Euros. On arrival we were met by the most charming host (Luven) - many apologies if I spelt his name incorrectly! He told a little of the history of the place and showed us the very elegant public spaces including a very cosy bar which is well stocked with all manner of beverages including excellent Champagnes and Whiskies. The wood panelled bar is smoking, not a plus for us, but you can take drinks in any of the other drawing rooms adjacent to the bar. Our host also offered us a welcome drink (Champagne, of course!) which sat and enjoyed whilst our bags were whisked upstairs and we relaxed into our opulent surroundings. The hotel was seemed to be quiet during our stay (or maybe the other guests were very discreet!), and at some times, it felt like our own private house. We were staying on a spa package (excellent value) for 2 nights in a suite. The suite was spacious and nicely furnished, but I think that if you want one of the grander suites (like the Lagerfeld designed ones shown on the website), you would need to specifiy and book the higher room class. It had a separate sitting area and there was a kitchenette (no utensils or crockery, so not sure if this option is used much). We had 2 mini-bars, both of which were stocked (no wine/champagne) and included in the room rate. Minor niggles were no mirror above the dressing table in the bathroom, underpowered hairdryers and no little dishes (which I would have liked to put my jewellery on!). We were in a room at the back to the hotel and in the morning we did hear some noise from delivery trucks, but it was not too bad and not enough to want to make us move. But these were minor points and easily looked over as the service and facilities were excellent throughout the hotel. The \"spa\" element of our stay was a massage on day 1 and manicure or pedicure on day 2. Being fairly sporty and used to burly massage therapists in ski resorts, we were not expecting too much from our relaxation massages, but we were both very pleasantly surprised. The therapist managed to get the balance between effective massage and relaxation bang on and it was perhaps the best such massage I have had. The manicure the next day was just OK, but I am quite particular about manicures, so don't be deterred as the cuticle work was good and the hand massage lovely. The spa was small but well equipped - swimming pool was an adequate size to have a decent swim and had a jacuzzi to the side. Unfortunately the steam room was being maintained when we were there, but there was a Swedish sauna, cold plunge pools (are you joking!!?), massage shower and solarium. After a pleasant spa day, we had dinner on our second evening in the fine dining restaurant, Vivaldi. You can have a set menu, tasting experience or choose a la carte - the staff were very flexible and accomodating to my particular needs and I felt that anything I asked for would be no trouble which was refreshing. Had Champagne courtesy of the hotel as an aperatif and a great bottle of wine recommended by the sommelier. The wine list was interesting and had some great local wines to choose from as well as the more recognisable old and new world classics. Overall, we had a wondeful stay at the hotel and would definitely return. We have stayed in some amazing hotels around the world including a few Small Luxury Hotels (which this is one) and I remember it favourably amongst the city hotels we have stayed in. However, it was the hotel staff that made this a special stay for us - from Luven, the porter (whose name we never learned!) to the beautican and restaurant staff - everyone smiled and made us feel welcome in a down to earth and genuine way.

But untill I came first in may 2009 to Schlosshotel Grunewald I was not thinking of Berlin as of relaxation city. Schlosshotel was redesigned perfectly by Karl Lagerfeld, which is important. The whole building is an outstanding work of architecture. Like in a fairy tale you enjoy country air and can't help admiring antique decoration of the hotel mixed with the very modern and professional managing. I can not imagine better place for me to stay in Berlin. The location is comfy:15 minutes car drive from city centre. Nearby there's an outstanding Italian restaurant. The food that is served in the hotel is wonderfull, cooked properly, creative and classy at once. The staff respondes to your every request. In may they arranged the whole european trip for me, this time during my second stay it was very pleasant that after big shopping the staff arranged the taxi driver to pick up my heavy bags from the boutiques and to deliver them to the hotel, though I could continue my way without any need to pull all those nice purchases myself from shop to shop. All the rooms in the hotel are very cosy, quite big and airy. Just one point to be aware of: in hot summer it is better not to stay in the rooms with small windows situated directly under the roof, it will be too hot. As well the air conditioning system is not the modern one, and may be noisy. Some technical details (like curtains) should be replaced with the automatic ones. But those small details never spoil the whole sweet thing! BRAVO Schlosshotel Grunewald!

It's about an hour on the metro from Schoenfeld Airport, changing once at the Westkreuz metro station and waiting on the platform for the corresponding train to arrive. The hotel is located in the peaceful and upmarket residential area of Grunewald, and is about a 10-15 minute walk from Grunewald metro station or 5 minutes on the bus which departs from the metro station every 20 minutes or so. As we were only travelling with hand luggage (it was a weekender) we opted to wander through the leafy suburban lanes to the hotel. This walk from Grunewald Metro station is on the flat wide pavements, and we admired an array of parked up Porsches behind which stood some architecturally interesting private houses. After the short walk from the metro you turn right into a quiet street and halfway down you find the impressive Schlosshotel waiting for you. After entering the gated courtyard and walking up the steps into the hotel you wander through the spacious marbled lobby area which leads into the great hall. Check-in just off the lobby is discrete, professional and the staff attitude perfect. The \"grandeur\" of the great hall certainly doesn't disappoint - and comes complete with imposing staircase, large chandeliers, classical piano and a huge presentation of freshly arranged flowers which filled the room with a fantastic scented aroma. There are plenty of large comfortable sofas and chairs here in which to sip a cool drink, relax and soak up the rich atmosphere. Just off the hall is the Vivaldi restaurant, a beautifully decorated dining room whose decoration mirrors the decadent richness of the hall. The hall also leads out to the patio area, which was a sun trap when we visited and took our \"welcome\" drink - nice touch!! Staying on the patio to take an alfresco lunch all washed down with some chilled Sancerre, you really begin to feel you are somewhere \"special\" as the tranqulity and ambience take effect. The lunchtime menu choice was extensive, the beef stroganoff of particular note and the overall quality of all the fare was top notch. The \"specialness\" vibe continued upstairs where our accomodation was a \"Grand Deluxe\" room on the third floor, which consisted of an intimate attic styled boudoir. The bed was huge, a bit soft but very comfortable nonetheless The room had a separate walk-in bathroom - marble everywhere !! With a large bath and separate shower. There was a moderate sized wardrobe and hanging space for suits / dresses. My only criticism of the room was that despite the warm temperature outside, inside it was stuffy and the aircon was pretty ineffectual - so we kept the windows open for the duration of our stay. The hotel has a moderate sized indoor pool and spa area which consists of a small gym area with some weights, a couple of jogging machines and a couple of separate treatment rooms for massages. The sauna and steam room themselves were good but quite small - but we had the place to ourselves mid afternoons when we visited, although I could imagine things getting quite cosy if 5 or 6 couples were using the facilities all at once !! So overall, The Schlosshotel is deserving of praise and is a really great little country house style hotel. It's location is quite out of the way if you want to have sightseeing on your doorstep (taxi to Brandenbug Gate about \u20ac20) but if you crave privacy and just want to get away from it all then this is the place for you. The only criticism on this otherwise fantastic establishment was the lack of ingenuity with the menu at dinner. Whilst the food was splendid, there just wasn't enough options to choose at dinner time. The lunch menu was varied and good but in the evening it disappeared and the restaurant could only offer a set 4, 5 or 6 course tasting menu starting at \u20ac79 for 4 courses without wine - no Ala Carte option. And a minimum tab of \u20ac180 for two without vin seemed overpriced compared to lunch... This was such a shame really - but all was not lost : My top tip if you're staying here and fancy a wander out in the evening is to visit a superb Italian restaurant about 5 mins walk from the hotel on the way to the Grunewald metro station. We dined in the very pleasant restaurant garden, rubbing shoulders with the well heeled locals, and we consumed three delicious courses and drank very well for about \u20ac90 all in - including vin and bier !! Its location is on the corner where the Menzelstrasse and Hagenstrasse meet. So overall, Schlosshotel Grunewald is great if you want to get away from it all and just chill in a wonderful green tree lined suburb, but ISNT a city centre hotel with sights on it's doorstep. - Which is why we chose it !! Go there and put your feet up !!!", "Date": "May 8, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cquiet gem in a residential area\u201d", "Author": "HeikeBerg", "ReviewID": "UR6546347", "Content": "If you would like to have all the major tourist attractions in walking distance or a quick cab ride away, then you are better off staying at the Hyatt or somewhere more central.

That said, we have stayed at the Schlosshotel a few times and will return. You get great value for your money. Each room is individually designed with charming, classical decor. I wouldn't stress too much who the designer is, because if I had known before visiting it could have easily turned me off. But it's actually very tastefully done. In spite of all the curtains and carpets it still feels light and playful. The atmosphere is that of a residence more than that of a hotel. The breakfast buffet is splendid! and the staff is attentive and polite. I have seen someone from the front desk sprint down the block after a guest who had left a glove.

When asked if there was a place non-smokers could go, we were directed either outside, or to our rooms. Not nice for a place that charges over $200 a room (minimum) a night. The TV program cards in the rooms do not accurately reflect where the programs are (poor attention to detail, or simply not caring), and the DVD players in the rooms only play Region 2 (Europe) discs, which hardly caters to an international crowd. There are no coffee services in the rooms (a standard, and welcome commodity in much less expensive houses), forcing you to pay outrageous amounts for room service. The food prices are extremely high, and you may find that what you want is not available (as happened to us more than once). The breakfast is 23 euros per person and, while slightly varied, is not worth it. Nor is $20 for a small bowl of spaghetti, or $10 for a bottle of water. We also had poor experiences with the wait staff. While they are polite, and completely bi-lingual, we were charged $25 for our \"Complimentary Welcome Drink,\" which was later \"rectified\" by offering us six finger sandwiches and two small pieces of cake.

Possibly because we are used to London restaurants were the favours are much simpler and allow the ingredients to speak for themselves we found the combination at the restaurant a bit strange and not to our palate.
