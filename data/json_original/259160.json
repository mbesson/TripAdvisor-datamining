Its difficult to see the one and only entrance when arriving due to the neighboring office building, which blocks a view of the ingress situation. Otherwise, the service is good, they have free Internet service which works reasonably well and the rooms are clean and neat with a lot of workspace. The hotel is close to the Bancomer Expo Center, but despite the proximity, it is a difficult walk due to the layout of Santa Fe.

However, the Novotel Santa Fe has some serious management issues. I booked for 3 nights for a business trip together with a colleage. The location itself is nice, besides that there is a really next construction site next to the hotel (another hotel being build) - this results in some outside areas of the hotel to be closed, and lots of noise. As the room windows are good, that's not a big problem though. The problems however started when we wanted to eat. In the hotel restaurant at the first evening I ordered chicken cordon bleu. The chicken I was served had been fried several ours ago, and even already got cut in the middle at the point. They just warmed it up. The cheese therefore had already been gone hard instead of being melted, color was orange, the meat itself was extremely dried out. I could not finish this. I complained to the waitress, who also was shocked about the dish. I then was served dessert, and this was REALLY bad. I ordered flan, some kind of creme caramel - it involves raw egg, so this has to be really fresh. But it also had gone bad already. I just took one bite, noting immediately that the egg had gone bad - still I had to stay quite a lot of time on the restroom that night. The next morning the breakfast again was really bad - the scrambled eggs again appeared to be several hours old etc. In addition to that, the room cleaning hasn't been really good - when we arrived, the windows were really dirty. In the morning at 8am, someone was waking up everyone on the floor by knocking on each door asking if we had some clothes that need to be cleaned - terrible idea. It took until 4pm until room cleaning showed up. While I had booked for 3 nights, at this point I decided I'm not getting myself food poisened another time, and booked another nearby hotel. We went to the front desk to tell that we were checking out, telling them in detail on what had happened to us. We didn't get an excuse, instead we were told we could not check out because we had booked for 3 nights. I demanded to speak to the manager. I was told excuses that the manager would not be in the house, then after half an hour someone turned up telling us he is the assistance to the manager (which was a lie) and basically they did everything to make sure we would not speak to the manager. I had to threaten them to charge back the full amount from my credit card until after an hour they finally called for the real manager. He did excuse a lot, promised to investigate, and made sure we were able to check out paying only for the single night we had stayed. All in all this has been the most unpleasant stay at a hotel ever for me. This hotel needs to get a audit from Novotel urgently. While the hotel would be nice, at it's current state I can not at all recommend going there.", "Date": "June 20, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "montreal", "Title": "\u201cGood quality / price ratio\u201d", "Author": "fredtravel99", "ReviewID": "UR48248270", "Content": "Stayed there for a week in October.

Thankfully, a mild case of Montezuma's revenge. The hotel allowed me to pay the doctor by adding his bill to my hotel charges (for a small service fee). The hotel arranged a cart to pick me up at the airport, and that went very smoothly. They also arranged a car and driver to take me out to the pyramids in the morning on the day I was departing, and then to drop me at the airport.

Although food is good and size portions are fine, a lot more training is needed for their cooking staff, specially during breakfast time. They are not used to the way american people may ask for their fried eggs (e.g. easy -over). In Mexico there is no such thing as an easy-over fried egg. Cooks in hotel should be taught all these things. Because it is a buffet, waiters are just looking to take away your dirty plates or bring you some more coffee, but if you ask for something else, they would answer very politely that you can get it from the buffet bar.

However it is the service and management of this hotel that makes it a place to avoid. I have stated there a total of 5 times (business trips) due to the fact that it is the lower cost option. Each and every one of those times was marked by some kind of disappointment and service failure. The most memorable were the following: the time the restaurant below the hotel (Fishers) threw an all night party with loud music until 2:30 am on a Thursday night, or the time the hotel allowed a high school baseball team stay, and did not intervene when the kids were running down the hall and knocking on doors and calling every room. (Again, at 2 am in the morning). The last time I was there, apparently due to cost cutbacks, they did not subscribe to BBC anymore as they had before, and CNN was on the fritz, and it took them over a week to fix, while at first denying a problem existed with the channel. That was the only other English channel available. (I speak Spanish, but it is nice to decompress with some English) When you ask for a wake-up call, it is a 50/50 chance you will get one. The counter personnel are so poorly trained (and slow) it is likely you will be standing for 20-30 minutes when you check out if there is more than one person in front of you.
