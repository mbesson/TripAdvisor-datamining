Stories about mosquitos are true, we were there in July and had to leave the windows open because it was so hot, but paid the price in mosquito bites! The location is fantasic, the Duomo is only a few minutes away, as are most of Florence's attractions. We found it very hard to actually locate the hotel, we walked up and down the street for at least half and hour before we found it. All the buildings have 2 different street numbers which is very confusing, and the sign for the hotel is on the wall of the building and very small! Follow the advice of one of the other reviewers - look for the bridal shop (there's only one in the street) and the hotel is directly opposite. Stories about the stairs are true - if you are not prepared to carry your luggage up lots and lots of stairs, don't book this place.

Its weak points are that the walls are thin and rooms are quite noisy - we stayed when it was half-empty, but the guys next to us kept us awake. Rooms vary quite a bit - we stayed in #7, nice (no fresco on the wall, but charmingly decorated) and #5 (double bed - too small for the two of us). It's a hostel or one-star hotel, so what you get will be pretty basic - towels are large but thin; breakfast is basic but decent (1 or 2 rolls, jam, cereal, processed cheese, lousy coffee). Beds were oddly comfortable, or maybe I was so exhausted that I could sleep through anything. The water from the faucets inexplicably smells of bleach - it didn't anywhere else in Florence. There are two bathrooms; use the tiny shower in the back (good water pressure) and not the larger shower next to the breakfast room (unless you like a gentle trickle for your shower). The hotel is up two long flights of stairs - but by the end of your stay in Florence, it'll feel like nothing. There's an office in the building that receives a lot of deliveries by scooter in the morning, so around 8 you'll hear a lot of scooter traffic echoing through the building (but you'll probably be up anyways). The staff is extremely helpful - booked reservations, recommended great restaurants, and were generally very nice. They have a book exchange. The street it's located on is a nice pedestrian-friendly street, and it's within ten minutes to everything in Florence. We were a little punchy after our long flight and had a hard time finding the place, even with their directions.

Duomo is only a few minutes on foot. We liked the location of this hotel a lot. The hotel is very old but it was fun to stay because we felt like staying at a medieval building.The hotel is located on the 3rd floor in the building and our room was on the 4th floor and there was no elevator. I really don\u9225\u6a9b know how you call \u9225\u6e07loors\u9225?in Italy because some of the stairs long and some are not. Anyway, it was a very good exercise to reach our room. To be honest, it was a challenge to climb up with our heavy laggauges when we first checked in. The staff seemed a nice guy and first he offered me to carry my laggauge from the 3rd floor to the 4th (or you may call it from 3rd to the 3rd and half). When he found out my carry-on was heavy he quickly pretended that he had a backache and dropped it. It was very obvious and our family was able to tell that he was faking. We thought he was very weird. We stayed a room with 3 beds and a bathroom. Beds are very old and sink when we get on them. Our kids were joking about the beds saying, \u9225\u6dedhese are like hammocks.\u9225?As some of the viewers mentioned, a shower doesn\u9225\u6a9b have a shower curtain or any kind of divider from a toilet so when we shower the whole bathroom gets very wet and has water puddles. You need to be very careful after shower so you don\u9225\u6a9b slip and fall. By the next morning it always gets dry though.Our major complain was mosquitoes. Since there is no air condition in the room they opened the windows before our arrival. There are no screens in the windows. We thought we would have no problem with mosquitoes since we were on the 4th floor. We were wrong. We had major mosquito attack on our first night. We had decided to choose between the hot room and mosquito attack. I understand that Hotel Bavaria is not a luxurious hotel so we can compromise some of the aspects of the Hotel. In my opinion, I highly recommend this hotel when you stay there in cool months when you don\u9225\u6a9b need to open the windows and you don\u9225\u6a9b need to worry about mosquitoes.

I had a shared bathroom and a very simple room, but that\u9225\u6a9a what one would expect in this price category. The building is a classic Florentine apartment building, which now has a mix of apartments and businesses. It has a pleasant courtyard, a sweeping staircase (note that Hotel Bavaria is on the third floor off the ground and there\u9225\u6a9a no lift, so it\u9225\u6a87 be difficult for people with strollers, wheelchairs or large amounts of heavy luggage), and inside it is furnished in traditional Florentine style: simple, comfortable and classic.The location is superb: right in the middle of the \u9225\u6965entro Storico\u9225?(the historical centre) about a block away from the famous Duomo (Cathedral) and within a mile or so\u9225\u6a9a walk to just about any important sight, museum and monument in Florence. Here\u9225\u6a9a a summary of my other impressions over the four nights I stayed here:THE GOOD* perfect location* very clean* quiet at night (yes, you can hear some street noise, but this is Florence and having previously lived in the city for a couple of years I felt the level of noise here was very low for the city centre)* friendly, helpful staff* good value for money (it\u9225\u6a9a not great value, but Florence has a reputation as a very expensive city and it\u9225\u6a9a OK in comparison with other places)* I have memories of vicious, clever Florentine mosquitoes who enjoyed tormenting me when I lived in the city, so one of my first questions was about whether they were bad at present. I was immediately given an electronic mozzie zapper to plug in at night, and didn\u9225\u6a9b suffer any bites during my stay.* breakfast was included. It was very simple, but OK for a one star hotel, and the breakfast room was pleasant enough.* on the ground floor of the hotel there were two shared bathrooms for rooms without their own. These were kept quite clean during my stay (I\u9225\u6a93 fussy about cleanliness/hygiene and found nothing to complain about here).* reasonable security * good sized room (especially considering mine was a single room without bathroom) with a hand basin.* comfortable bed with wonderful, fresh, crisp, quality linen. THE DOWNSIDES:* it could do with a fresh coat of paint.* there\u9225\u6a9a no phone in the room (though it is just a one star hotel, so you wouldn\u9225\u6a9b expect one) BUT they were happy to take messages.* there\u9225\u6a9a no TV in the room (though, again, one wouldn\u9225\u6a9b expect one in a one star hotel) but there\u9225\u6a9a one in the breakfast room if you\u9225\u6a99e desperate for your telly-fix.SUMMARY:Recommended!
