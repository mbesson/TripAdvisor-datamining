I would say hotel represents value for money compared to other similar properties and if you want something simple and nothing fanciful, this hotel will meet your needs. For those who are traveling with small babies, the Fragrance Hotel - Sapphire in Geylang is very inconveniently located. Actually Lorong 10 Geylang is almost in the middle way between Kallang and Aljuned MRT stations, slightly closer to Kallang (15-20 min walk), than to Aljuned (20-25 min walk). There is bus stop nearby (Geylang Road) - 5 min walk. This \u201ctwo star\u201d rated hotel offers very basic accommodation. Superior twin air-conditioned room is equipped with queen size bed (small for two persons and two-years old baby), narrow one-door wardrobe, flat-panel televisions with satellite channel and DVD/CD player. All accommodations provide phones, hair dryer and coffee/tea makers. Complimentary 2 bottle waters, satchels of coffee, and toiletries are provided daily. Toilet room is small, and the shower, sink & toilet are all packed in small area, and the floor gets wet and slippery when you have a shower. Shower is equipped with dispenser for liquid soap, so do not expect to find bar soap or shampoo in complimentary toiletries. In-room safe and refrigerators are not provided. Actually it is first time from my travel experience when I was told that there are no refrigerators in hotel (!) to keep my baby\u2019s drug. Although staff were very friendly and always ready to help out. House-keeping is very good, room is very clean and fairly quiet. Snow-white towels and bed-clothes are changed daily (!). There is no breakfast, but options nearby are numerous eateries with real value for the money. Overall Singapore is the most stroller-friendly country in South-East Asia, so traveling with baby in stroller is not difficult (especially if to compare with neighboring Malaysia) but not in Geylang, \u2026 In the evening time in crowded Geylang, when eateries occupy sidewalks with tables, possibility to stroll between tables becomes the horror of all horrors. Regarding prostitution in this red-light district\u2026 this appears to be least irritating thing, even if you are traveling with small baby. This is district with de facto brothel prostitution. Although I think most of them are probably harmless, it is not the best place for families with babies.", "Date": "April 2, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manila", "Title": "\u201cJust sleep\u201d", "Author": "ASEManila", "ReviewID": "UR126662539", "Content": "We went for a Singapore tour and my husband booked this hotel.

The dust was so thick that it formed in cotton like balls and all of a sudden i felt like I caught a bad case of asthma.I immediately reported it to the front desk but didn't bother anymore checking if it got cleaned. i was just afraid of what i might see...

Locals have come from India, Pakistan, China, Indonesia, Malaysia, The Philippines, and of course, locally born Singaporeans. Geylang, though it does have a \"Red Light District\" is a bustling area filled with great food, great people, and affordable nightlife. If you've researched hotels on Orchard Road, and found that Geylang hotels are about 1/2 to 1/4 the cost, it's because the area is off the typical path of tourist shoppers. If you're looking to go beyond the surface of Singapore, you'll love being located here in Geylang. 10min from both Alljunied and Kallang MRT stations, you can get anywhere you want via train (and quite inexpensively). Never waited more than 3min for a taxi, and the hotel staff seemed knowledgeable of bus routes and the area. The room was perfect for me. I traveled solo, and didn't pack much stuff. I did stay for six days, which seems longer than most stays, judging by other reviews. The hotel can be a bit noisy, as it's all tile. No carpeting, so the sound travels through the hallways pretty quickly. I just wanted a clean place to shower and sleep, and that is what I got. Clean, tile bathroom, approx 27\" LCD TV on the wall, and new sheets and towels each day. The hotel was an amazing value for money. If you're traveling with more than two people total, you will need a family sized room, which they also offer at only a slightly higher rate. They do not have a business center, but you can connect to wifi or use their desktops for a few bucks per day. If you are realistic about your expectations, this hotel will suit you just fine. Don't expect a concierge or drinks on the terrace at 5pm (they don't have a terrace....). This is a low-cost hotel that far outdoes the other options in Geylang.", "Date": "April 19, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Blacktown, Australia", "Title": "\u201cNo big deal if its cheap & clean\u201d", "Author": "Genghis_Kwan", "ReviewID": "UR48456545", "Content": "Paying $50 SGD for a clean private room in Singapore is like eating free food, your alternative for a little less is a dorm in Little India which has as much appeal as watching Test cricket..zzzzz The hotel is located in Geylang, apparently a red light district but it seems more like a lively street restaurant scene than anything sinister. Geylang comes to life at night as it plays host to street stalls & noodle bars that offer cheap Asian dishes in typical clean Singaporean style. The neon lights& buzz make Geylang a great place to drink & eat cheap food without paying the ridiculous tourist prices. Not only randy old men but locals hang out at here too. The Fragrance Sapphire hotel is budget in terms of size & floor space but makes up for in value, it is by no means tiny rather small but compact much like what you would experience with the Accor Group\u2019s Ibis Hotel chain. Whinging about staying here is pointless as it is clearly a budget hotel & not aimed at Orchard Road fine dinners, it\u2019s a case of expecting more than what you actually paid. The room has everything a hotel room is expected to have & is pretty typical of similar budget-medium range rooms of SE Asia. The reception staff were efficient, respectful & well dressed. I would also imagine discrete if one were to hire a room for an hour but I wouldn\u2019t know. I asked to see several rooms & this was granted without any complaint. The hotel rooms can be hired by the hour which is typical of hotels in the area, its in a red light district after all.

We booked the hotel online and stayed for 4 nights. As we arrived at the hotel and entered the room, my heart qucikly fell on my stomach as the room was so SMALL so does all the things in there..the tv, the bathroom and even the closet. What irked us was the foul odour of the room which smells cigarette and rotten durian wafting the room from the neighbour next door. My fiance made a complaint at the front desk and asked for the front desk to change us to a better room. The girl at the front desk was lacked of good customer service and dint try to do anything to make us happy. However she tried to bring us around the hotel in a 3 different room to choose from but none was better. So we changed to another fragrance chain - Sunflower which is just across the street. After touring 3 different room in that hotel we finally choose a room on the 2nd floor. Just like the rooms in the former hotel, this room was also SMALL. The toilet only had a sink and a shower with no tub. The bed was a queen size bed with a very thin white sheet and covered with a blue plastic underneath it. And not to mention the hard mattress with soft pillows making it hard for both of us to fall asleep at night. There was one closet with only 2 hangers. A stand with 2 cups, instant coffee packet and small mineral water cups. The SMALL plasma tv only has few channels but we could only watch one channel all the time. There was an air conditioning but once we turn it on it gets very cold that it rips my bones. It doesnt help either that we were given 2 blanket for each of us which is very thin. To add salt to the wounds i even had non stop diarrhea for 3 days, flu and non stop sneezing on the third day and it made me felt so miserable. Since it is a budget hotel and they rent it for hours and its hotspot location for \"girls\" looking for strangers to have fun so there were couple of times in the wee hours of morning i was woken up with some noise downstair. Luckily our room was facing the carpark so most of the time it was quiet. Overall i would say it was a bad experience for me and my fiance and was totally different from our first trip at one of the hotels in Orchard road. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone unless you are really broke as you need money everywhere in Singapore even they charge you for an empty cup from 7-eleven (My fiance need the empty cup to drink his medicine).", "Date": "September 8, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201cexcellent budget hotel\u201d", "Author": "FairyTaleDreamWorld", "ReviewID": "UR33229196", "Content": "Although this hotel is in the Geylang District, we saw no evidence of anything to suggest this during our two night stay!

The bus station is a few steps away, making it convenient to travel to and fro other destinations. The staff were very accommodating, allowing us to check in earlier than usual, and very flexible with the room arrangements. For us first-time singapore visitors, they tried their very best in guiding us through each relentless inquiry. The rooms, as expected, were really small, with just enough space to stack your luggage. But the rooms were spotless and the hotel very quiet. The bathroom is proportional to the room size -- tiny. The hotel provided complimentary coffee, biscuits and water, which were replenished daily (surprising for a hotel this size). The place transforms at night, when ladies suddenly appear in the streets around the hotel. However, this is the quieter side of the red light district, and is perfectly safe even when we have young children with us.
