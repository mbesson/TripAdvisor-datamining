We left our booking quite late and The Globe was one of the few hotels near the station with availability. Some of the reviews on trip advisor are terrible so I was a little reluctant to book. However we were pleased with our stay. It is true the Chinese chap on reception is very unhappy with his life. Don't expect a warm weclome on arrival. You won't get it. The other bar staff in the sportsbar were however very friendly. The private 5 bed room we stayed in was clean and the ensuite looked quite new. Despite being in a busy area, all of us had quite a peaceful night sleep. We felt safe at The Globe. The sportsbar food downstairs wasn't bad either. On arriving home I did develop one or two bites on my next (possibly bed bug / nat bites). The best feature about the hotel is that it's really close to the train station and ideally placed for the red light district and coffee shops. You leave the hotel and you're in the thick of the action. I would only recommend the hotel for a lads/stag trip or possibly backpackers. It's probably best not to take your wife/girlfriend here.

We are English Ajax supporters who travel quite regularly over for the games. Unfortunately our regular hotel has steadily gone up in price over the last couple of years so it was time to seek out alternative accommodation. So we opted for the globe. Basically you pays your money and get what you get. We paid 20 euro's each per night for a quad room which was on the first floor at the back of the hotel with a small window with absolutely no view whatsoever. The room was very basic but we did have an ensuite shower and toilet which was very handy. The shower had very good water pressure and the water was very hot, unlike some other budget hotels, there was no shower gel or soap supplied. The room was reasonably clean but at the time of writing this there is a lot of pavement work going on right outside the front of the hotel with tons of sand everywhere so the place looks like a beach! Sand had been trampled in all over the hotel including our room. The mattresses on our beds were way past their best and are long overdue to be changed. The bed linen was clean though. The bedroom furniture had seen better days as well but still served it's purpose for us. One thing the room didn't have which I like to have is an in-room safe, so take all your valuables with you. The lock on our door didn't look all that clever so dont leave anything of any value in the room. On a plus note, they serve a wicked breakfast in the bar at a reasonable price and the bar itself is open 24 hours. The hotel is situated right in the red light district and is a stones throw from centraal station, about a three to four minute walk. At the end of the day if you just want somewhere cheap and cheerful just to get your head down (after a long day and hard night) as we did, then you cant go far wrong for the money. However. if you are bringing your wife or girlfriend to Amsterdam for a few days break I would suggest something at little more upmarket. I can recommend the Amstel Botel (3 stars) floating hotel where I have stayed with my wife which offered good value for money. It is also just a stones throw from the station and in fact is not far from the globe. So would we stay at the Globe again?

I would not consider for one second staying in a shared dorm here--seems like it could be too rowdy or shady. The room was unexpectedly clean with spotless sheets, and no weird smells. The stairwells/hallways, however, sometimes smelled like marijuana and fried chicken, of which remnants could be found on the floor at at 3am. Pub on ground floor was never an issue with noise. Same with the street--it was at the edge of a canal, a stones throw from the red lights. It was only populated with drinkers during football matches.

You cannot walk 10 yards without being offered cocaine, ecstacy etc which becomes irritating (if it isnt your thing!) from the men who loiter at every turn.
