I had such a stressful stay. The first problem was that my room smelled of smoke and I was tight-chested trying to breathe in it. My colleague who visited my room to drop off some papers noticed the same thing. I rang and asked about this. I was told that the room was a non smoking room and that people shouldn't smoke in it. Well I knew that! But clearly someone HAD smoked in it. There was no effort to move me to another room. A young man came up and sprayed the room to little effect. The ventilation was stuffy and all I wanted to do was open a window. From the point of view of the air quality, I couldn't wait to leave. I raised this again on checkout and was told the room would be 'fumigated' again. Big Deal! The dinner at the Garden Court was also disappointing. I invited my colleague to dinner and was frankly, embarrassed about it. We have eaten there together and with others many times and have always been pleased. But the food was ordinary. My colleague's duck was tough and disappointing and my pork belly was very fatty - the fat had not been adequately rendered from it. The female hostess of the restaurant was not at all focussed and we had to ask several times for things. I was incredulous when she came and asked me if I would like a drink and then walked off with my order. She had not asked my colleague if he wanted one as well. So I had to get up from my place and go and find her and let her know that my colleague would like a drink too. She just wasn't with me! My colleague joined me in the bar for morning coffee. We both noticed that there was no soap (both on the day I checked in and day I checked out) in the male and female bathrooms near the Lobby Bar and near the Garden Court restaurant. This was two days running. I reported this to a hotel staff member. However when I left after having a drink in the bar there was still no soap in the ladies' toilet. The toilets at Central Train station are routinely better supplied than this. What has happened to the lovely hotel with the wonderful service that Sofitel Wentworth used to be?

I went on various accommodation websites and noticed the Sofitel Wentworth seemed to have really good rates on the nights we wanted. When I went to book it, Expedia offered me a free upgrade from the standard room (which I would've been happy enough with) to a Club Sofitel Prestige Suite. Of course I took it! For a 4 night stay, having a separate lounge room and bedroom, 2 bathrooms and just more space in general is much more pleasant than being slightly squashed into one single room. So we arrived in Sydney and got to the hotel (after getting there by foot from Wynyard Station, dragging our case up 3-4 blocks, all uphill!) at around 2.30pm. We went to check in at the normal foyer reception area, but were told to go up to Level 5 as we had a Club Sofitel suite and we would be checked in up there in the Club Sofitel Lounge. So up we went. The club lounge was very nice...cushy lounge chairs around small tables, a view of an internal sort of courtyard, TV screen, an assortment of cakes, macaroons, scones, tea and coffee for afternoon tea. We checked in, however due to some room cleaning issues earlier in the day, we were not able to actually get into our room yet. We were offered afternoon tea (free daily full buffet breakfast, afternoon tea, and \"happy hour\" drinks and canapes were available for Club Sofitel guests) so indulged in a macaroon and some coffee for a while before leaving our bags behind the counter and heading out to nearby Pitt Street Mall (about 2 blocks away). We wandered around, enjoying the bustling crowds and numerous talented street performers, looked in some shops, and then received a call (which I missed) from the hotel, so we went back, got our bags and found our room (on Level 15). So we got into the room and...it was a normal room, not a prestige suite like I'd seen on the website. The room was very NICE, but...it had 2 single beds (we'd ordered one king) and was just one room. So I went back down to the club lounge, and Andrew (who was fantastic by the way, despite having a bad day with the cleaning staff issues and also a new computer system that was having some first day teething problems), who had checked us in earlier, was very apologetic and promptly rectified the situation. We went up to our new room on Level 17 (the top level of the building), and the suite was REALLY nice. Almost TOO big! Separate living area with TV and DVD player, powder room, a main bathroom around the corner and then the large bedroom with king bed and another TV. We settled in quickly and were very happy to be \"home\" in our room finally. Whenever we entered or exited the hotel and the club lounge, we were greeted with \"Bonjour\" or \"Bonsoir\" due to the French heritage of the hotel, which I found very nice. Each morning we went down to the lounge for our breakfast, which we thoroughly enjoyed. The breakfast service is available in the lounge from 7.30am-10.30am, which suited us well. We were generally out of the hotel by 10am each day to make the most of our time in Sydney. The hotel is in an excellent location. Just 2 blocks to Pitt Street Mall, 2-3 blocks (uphill) to St James Station and Hyde Park, about a 10-15 minute easy walk to Darling Harbour, 3-4 blocks (downhill) to Wynyard Station, and 3-4 blocks to Circular Quay (also downhill)...coming back is a different story though. When you are tired and weary, walking up almost vertical inclines is HARD! Other things to note are that in our personal opinion, the bed was WAY too soft for us. We slept quite well in it, but noticed we kept sinking into various uneven / lumpy areas and each morning we would wake up with very sore backs. In fact, on the second morning of our stay, I was in quite severe back pain the whole day. The shower was excellent. Powerful flow, good hot water. As part of being a Club Sofitel guest, we a complimentary newspaper of our choice each morning, however only 2 mornings out of the 4 we were there did our paper arrive in its little cloth bag hanging on the outside of our door. Not sure what happened to the other 2 days' papers, but it was no big deal. I found at night it was fairly quiet, being 17 floors above the city. Though for someone with very sensitive ears, I did notice increasing traffic noise from about 4am or so. I don't think any of the rooms at the hotel have balconies, so any smokers...you will have to go down in the lifts (which at peak times could take a little while, but nothing too bad) and go outside. Check out in the club lounge after breakfast was effortless and quick. Normal check out is at 11am, which was perfect for us as our flight was at 1.10pm. All in all, we had a fantastic stay in Sydney and would definitely stay at the Sofitel Wentworth again. Another special mention to Andrew of the Club Sofitel lounge.

We originally booked a Superior Room but were upgraded to a Luxury Room. On the first night we noticed that the air-conditioning made a disturbing noise and reported the problem. Engineering staff were not available to fix it, so we were moved to a better Luxury Room (with L\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Occitane toiletries, an ipod docking station and a Nespresso machine). The move was dealt with quickly and efficiently. We tried the hotel breakfast on one occasion (we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t particularly like hotel breakfasts as there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nothing appealing about luke warm, dried up bacon etc). The choices were comparable with most other five star hotels, but at $40 each, it is an expensive option. However, the staff we encountered were very friendly and helpful. In fact all the staff we dealt with were friendly, courteous and pro-active in meeting our needs. One delightful characteristic is that to honour the French heritage of Sofitel, greetings such as bonjour, bonsoir and bon appetit are frequently extended. We used Room Service on quite a few occasions and this service was better than most we have experienced in Australia. The food was delicious, hot, very well presented and was delivered within half an hour or so of our order. Another service we appreciated was the hot beverages and pastries in the lobby for early morning departures. To make our flight, we had to check out at 5:45am, so a hot coffee and a warm pastry was a wonderful treat as we waited for our driver. The location of the Sofitel is perfect: close to Martin Place, Pitt Street Mall and Circular Quay. The only complaint I have about our stay is the VERY EXPENSIVE Wi-Fi. In this technological age, free Wi-Fi should be the norm in five star establishments. Fortunately, I only used my Ipad for checking email, banking and Facebook, however, business users could easily tot up a substantial internet bill. Lastly \u00e2\u20ac\u201c very comfy and cosy beds.

My pillow. As some other guests have already mentioned, Sofitel's pillow are THAT good. I wish they would sell them (believe me, I asked). As the rest of the hotel, it is an excellent choice for Sydney if you do not like to be in the middle of everything, but still stay pretty close to it. Access to buses and ferries are really good. It is also walking distance to Pitt Street. I like the fact that it is not in the crowded areas of Sydney (i.e. George St, etc.), but most things you need is pretty much around the hotel. There are 2 convenience store (one just across from the side entrance, one in the same block), there is a food court just accross the street (Chifley building) and the chain Sushi Tei in the same block. The check in and check out process went pretty smoothly. It would not have happened if Emily at the reception was not there. We innitially had (innitial) R to attend to us, and he was one of those pretty snotty kind of staff who looked down on you (just because you were using your complimentary voucher, or some otherworldly excuse). He tried to make live hard for us and even gave Emily an evil look for helping us. Fortunately Emily came to the rescue. Ha ! The rest of the staff was superb too. William in reception, Nick at concierge (he would make you laugh within 2 minutes of talking to him), and many others I did not come to know their names. Thumbs up for them. The room was ready for us when we arrived, although my friends had to wait another 20 minutes for theirs (we arrived after 2). Room was clean and had everything we needed. I was especially impressed with their coffee and tea selection. They had better than usual selection and was generous with them (4 tea choices with at least 3 bags each, 2 hot choccolate for the little kiddies in us, and more coffee than a caffeine-addict could ever finish in one day). The room had an ironing board, and good iron (offcourse!), and the twin bed were huge almost 140cm-wide. I would rave some more about the pillow, but I think I will save it for my next Sofitel review in Gold Coast. One thing I noticed missing was toothbrushes. I always travel with my own toothbrush, but at odd times when I forget my toothpaste I like the fact that the hotel has it. So when I did not see one at this hotel, it seemed a little strange to me. Luckily I had plenty of toothpaste to last me the whole 11 days' trip. Another thing was the chair by the window. I did not expect it since I have seen that some pictures had them and some did not. However, my friends and I booked the same upgraded room. Theirs had the chair, and mine did not. Lucky draw ? Overall, it is a very good hotel.

Upon arriving at the hotel at approximately 5:00pm, the attendant at the Reception did not even acknowledge my wife and I. She briefly looked up and continued on her phone call about what time she was starting in the morning and the earliest time she could be 'up' that afternoon. I understand that people receive phone calls they need to take, but there wasn't even a smile, an 'I won't be a moment gesture' or ANYTHING, let alone telling the person on the other end of the line that she would phone back. She then proceed to advise that my reservation required payment. It was prepaid as per the confirmation I presented. Her manager also insisted that the girl was correct. I EVEN SHOWED THE TRANSACTION WHERE THE MONEY HAD BEEN WITHDRAWN! The room was lovely, as expected. It was clean and quiet and we enjoyed a lovely night's sleep. Breakfast the next day was another nightmare though. The staff were rude, bored and slow with no sense of urgency, personality or customer service. The food was quite good... Very simple. There were never any bowls, plates or glasses at the buffet which was extremely frustrating. Our coffees never arrived, despite us asking twice for them. There seemed to be about 4 or 5 staff on but none of them ever came to our table. The supervisor or manager seemed a little vacant and unconcerned with the whole debacle. Check out again was slow, perhaps because we were checking out at 10:00am (check out is 11:00am) and a number of people were also leaving at this time. That said, again the attendant was curt and 'pushing the departures though'. We weren't even asked how our stay was or given the standard 'have a nice day'. The most consecutive words spoken were 'anythign from the minibar'. Very, very disappointing. I wrote to the hotel after departure and my comments were addressed by the hotel manager's assistant. Credit should most certainly be given to this young lady as she promptly followed up my concerns and had the courtesty and professionalism to regularly write to me to inform me of the progress of the 'investigation' for lack of a better word. She was extremely patient, sympathetic and everything that you would associate with a supposed five star hotel. Although she couldn't make the hotel better, i feel that I must give her credit because I was nothign short of impressed with her manner. Otherwise I woudl have scored 0/5. In short, she should be out there managing, preventing these issues, not dealing with them. Upon speaking with her, I have agreed to try the hotel again next time i'm in town.

I turned up early (11 am and, was not expecting to be checked into a room) to offload my bag and head off to an event at the Opera House. I was pleasantly surprised to be checked-in when I presented at the counter, I was advised a room was available and, I could 'freshen up' before the event which was welcome after a few hours travel. On the advice of the man checking me in, I paid the extra and took Club Sofitel (on the 5th floor) which included a room upgrade and a few other 'perks' for an extra AUD$80.00. My room had a view of the courtyard garden on the 5th floor, the room and bathroom was clean, pleasantly decorated in neutral tones. The standout for me was sleeping on one of the most comfortable king sized hotel beds I have slept on in a long, long time complimeted by the pillows. The last time I slept on a bed with pillows this good was somewhere in Dubai! I took dinner in the Garden Court Restaurant which has a superb menu and wine list, on the night I dined I was offered the last table at that time and, late comers were asked to return later! I think that speaks for the quality of the venue. Breakfast was a self serve affair at Club Sofitel - I always choose a Continental breakfast and was delighted to see a selection of fresh rather than canned fruits, there was table service for eggs, coffee, tea etc. One of the 'perks' I mentioned previously includes paying my hotel bill and checking out of the hotel at the end of breakfast at Club Sofitel. As I exited the elevator on the Lobby floor to see clusters of individuals waiting to check out I discovered the true value of $80.

We had booked in advance on the recommendation of other friends who had stayed here some time ago and had reported a great hotel and overall experience. With high hopes were at least slightly disappointed. On arrival I was told there was no booking, either in my name or that of my friend. The front desk staff did not appear particularly interested in assisting me to find the booking or resolve the situation - they suggested I call my friend to confirm the name out room was booked in. I did so and confirmed the name and was again told there was no relevant booking. Soon after my friend arrived and it turned out the hotel had mistakenly entered his name during the booking process, the names were close, but apparently not close enough the front desk could find them until we 'discussed' the issue with them for some time. Normally we'd have booking details with us, however being a phone booking we didn't have them at the time. The next disappointment was the 'credit swipe' process. We had $450 put 'on hold' against a credit card for a security deposit. To me that was a little high considering the room was around $300 a night. I've travelled widely and the standard is usually $1, $100 or the equivalent to one night's stay. No major concern though, as these deposits are refunded back to yor car two weeks later. On arriving at our room the decor was nice and modern, although the room was a little small for a twin, there was only about 15cm between the two beds, again, no major issue, but a bit more space would have been nice. (see pic) Into the bathroom and this is where disappointment really set in. The bathroom was nothing short of disgusting. The toilet seat was improperly attached and made using the bathroom akin to riding a rodeo bull (OK it wasn't that bad but it was definately not the standard you expect from such a hotel). The hand basin and bath/shower were also quite mouldy. The problem with the level of mould is that it suggested not that a single cleaner had missed something, but that there was a systemic issue with the cleaning process. I raised concerns about the bathroom (both the unstable toilet seat and the cleanliness) with the front desk and was told they'd be looked at while we out for dinner. When we returned the toilet seat had been fixed, however the mould remained - it didn't look like there had been any attempt to clean it - The photos I've uploaded were after the 'cleaning'. On the upside the bed was fantasticly comfortable and the pillows were also perfect - My friend reported a great night's sleep too.

Laying on this bed it felt like having every arch, nook and crest in your body filled in with a sponge. And while we were out - our room was re made up for us. And a lovely note was left for us. Easy check in (in the situation that we had won this accommodation as a part of a prize) and easier check out .

Highlight was the conceirge staff who were incredibly helpful. It was so easy to wake up in the morning decide where to go without knowing how to get there, go downstairs and ask the concierge and in 2 minutes have a map and easy directions to follow, bus, taxi, ferry etc. They also organised a limousine service to the airport which was good value, fixed rate, unlike the taxis.

Without rambling too much; the service is the jewel in the crown. A quick example of this was on the day we checked out we decided to take the kids to Taronga zoo. We left our bags in the room and the staff arranged them to be stored (we had about 15 pieces of luggage!!), headed off to the zoo, got drenched in the rain and 3 hrs later returned to the hotel; cold,miserable and wanting to leave. The concierge wouldn't have it and took us up to the lounge again (remember we checked out 3 hours before), he arranged for all of our luggage to be delivered to the lounge and we used the bathroom facilities to shower and get warm again.The bathrooms in the lounge are the most opulent I've ever seen and they are pristinely maintained.The mirror has a heater behind it (similar to floor heating) and the radiant heat coming from the mirror onto my frozen body was blissful and hedonistic! After showering we were then invited to have a hot drink and food at the lounge (remember we have already checked out and they are still looking after us!!) During all of this the staff were engaging the children and they couldn't offer us enough help. Charles was an absolute gentleman to my moments-before-frazzled wife. We left the Sofitel warm, dry, fed and grateful for all the kindness we received.

This was actually the attitude of the hotel, politely doing as little as possible. We didn't eat in the hotel because when we ordered two similar cocktails, they arrived looking quite different from each other, i.e. one was quite dark and the other very light. Also, I found it a bit pretentious for all staff to great guests with \"bonjour\" and then when I continued the conversation in French, they all coyly advised that they could only say \"bonjour\" - what was that about??????? Good points - we were tired, bed was comfortable, room was quiet and we were left in peace. Checkout was cold and efficient, with no-one offering to carry our bags (and when we were checking out we saw lots of new arrivals lugging their own suitcases).

When the noise kept us awake until late one evening then resumed around 6am the next day we made a trip to the next floor to investigate. There were no signs of renovations. In fact it appeared from the newspapers on the doors that there was a similar occupancy level to our floor. We then asked another staff member who told us the sound was indeed people dragging their chairs over the tiled floor in the restaurant several floors below. Apparently the sound carries through the various shafts in the hotel. We were told we were not the first to make a complaint. Although the noise wasn't excessively loud we were probably kept awake more through intrigue that anyone was working so late and began again so early. It was very disappointing that we had apparently been lied to by a staff member. I would only rate housekeeping as average. Apart from some of the staff not acknowledging you as you approached them one member didn't even respond when greeted. The cleaning of the bathroom was not up to standard and there was not the level of attention to tidying the room that I expect in a 5 star hotel.

My recent stay, however, at the Sofitel Wentworth Sydney was disappointing. I arrived rather late in the evening as my flight was delayed. My A|Club status provides free room upgrades where possible. On this circumstance, because it was a weekend and I was checking in rather late, there weren't any available, however the reception staff tried their very best, and I was able to get an upgrade to the top floor, which I was grateful for. Admittedly I booked the bottom-basic room they had to offer as I was only there for one night, so I couldn't expect a luxury suite, however the room was really a shoe-box. Europe is known for small hotel rooms, but this was woeful for a 5-star luxury hotel. My A|Club status also allows for complimentary welcome drinks, which I didn't see at all... The bathroom doors were doors belonging to a wardrobe or closet. The room had been recently renovated, however I'm not sure they had finished it: there was an ironing board in the room but no iron; the television didn't work; I didn't get any slippers; there were little white flecks all over the place from the new paint-job; and the bathtub was dirty. Of course, this could have been resolved with a call to House Keeping, however for this level of hotel, I should have expected this to be checked before the room was available. The room was positioned right next to the lifts which ensured I was bothered by the lift motors running all night. I realise someone has to stay in the room there, however it was still annoying. On the other hand, the staff were very courteous and helpful, except perhaps the three male bar staff who were all more interested in chatting up a Spanish tourist than printing the bill for my $9 cup of coffee.

I said that was ok but when we spoke to a gentleman when we booked out on the 27th December he said we just had to say we had made prior arrangements for early check in. The gentleman I had then was great and said give it an hour and come back. On our return we got Rod. Rod just said nothing he could do as computer down and could not look at anything until after 1.00pm. It was 12.10pm by this time. We sat in the foyer and watched while other people booked in and none where turned away. I was getting a little hot under the collar by 1.20pm and I'm sure Rod could see I was a little upset. He then called us forward and allocated both myself and my husband and my brother and sister in law our rooms. He also presented me with a drinks voucher but not one for my brother. When I asked him about a voucher for my brother he said he was given one when he booked in earlier. I advised he had not been given a voucher earlier so he just thru a voucher at my brother. Off we went to our rooms. I was allocated 1106. While awaiting 10 minutes for our luggage we we driven crazy by constant hammering and also a jack hammer. When Ben delivered our luggage I asked him about the noise and Ben advised the hotel was doing renovations and the noise would stop at 4.00pm. Let me say Ben was the shing light in all of this he was the only person who told me the truth and was so polite and helpful at all times. This constant hammering continued until about 1.45pm when I could not stand it any longer and rang to ask what could be done as we were trying to have a rest and with the very loud noise that was impossible. I was told a manager would call me back. No one had called me back by 2.45pm so I called again and was but thru to the assistant Manager and she said she would organise for us to be moved if that's what we really wanted. She was not helpful or sympathetic at all. She said she would have a room ready shortly and would give me a call. At 3.40pm No one had called back so I rang again and was told a room would be ready shortly and if I could just be patient. Well I do not know how much more patient I could have been.

Given this, the room was not yet ready but they called our mobile as soon as it was. The suite has separate bedroom and lounge rooms with their own toilets and television. The bathroom included bath, shower and one of the toilets and had a good range of amenities included. The club lounge was spacious with adjoining rooms that could be isolated if required. Cocktail hour had a good selection of spirits and wines but only entry level champagne available. The food selection was also quite decent and could substitute for a light dinner if you were that way inclined. The one drawback is the club staff never mention last drink orders, something we have come to expect from other lounges, but this may be because we were sitting away from other guests. We took breakfast only once and that was in the club, where we found nothing to complain about. We were uncertain whether breakfast could also be taken in the main restaurant with club access rooms. We had room service once, which we had delivered to the club for dinner, and found it to be good value and quality, as far as room service is concerned.

Frankly if you were putting me into the room without knowing where I am I would have never though that this is a Sofitel room (or a 4 or 5 star hotel room). Main problem 2: Internet. It is crazy expensive and one night it was not working. I called the reception and they told me that they can do nothing and I have to call the internet provider myself!!! They gave me the number of the provider to call! And I was so desperate for internet connection that I called the provider myself only to understand that the help-centre was not operating at that time. I called again the reception but was helpless; Neither the receptionist nor the shift manager did anything to assist me and overall they were unresponsive and they didn't care. The best thing now: When my connection came back (after many hours) they charged me double and I had to make an issue when I was checking out. I mean how you charge twice internet for one night?!

Location is convenient to the office I was working out of in Sydney's Central Business District. Rooms are not big - beds are a little too soft for comfort. Strange arrangement with the bathroom door being in 2 parts like cupboard doors. There was no tub in the room I stayed at, which I was paying over Aud$350/night. Since I was working every day from 9am - 9pm, I only got to see the gym as I walked past it every morning and at night as I returned back from work. I guess I'm spoilt by hotels in other countries, and this being my first visit to Australia, I must say I'm disappointed that they charge extra for everything. My company typically recommends using iPASS to connect to the internet, but the hotel blocks this even though it shows up on the directory upon iPASS connection search. I ended up paying around AUD$30 a day for internet. There was no complimentary bottled water, and in spite of the fact people tell me tap water in Australia is drinkable, prices of bottled water in Sydney is highway robbery - even more than what you'd pay in Paris! 7-11's are a rip-off and so are the CITY Convenience Stores around CBD. If you're looking to buy water or breakfast items, I suggest heading down George Street to the Woolworth's or Coles supermarket for much better deals than the convenience stores. Around the hotel there isn't much going on after 8pm, and walking around at night you stand a chance running into Post-Happy-hour drunks. All in all, if you have business in the CBD district, SOFITEL is likely a convenient, but probably not the best choice for value. I've stayed at other Sofitel's across Asia and definitely this is not one that would be known for its hospitality. One day I had yogurt for breakfast, and left in a hurry for work in the morning. By the time I returned in the evening, I found the yogurt still on the nightstand, and the bins have not been emptied.

No we would like our suite considering check in time is 2pm, we finally got our suite at 5.20pm, don't believe the hotel website that all suites have 2 flat screen TV's, we had 2 TV's that were definately not flat screens, more like 15 year old big blurry boxes (see photos). When we questioned the staff regarding the tv's, they said they hadn't got around to putting them in all the suites yet, I said it states on the hotel website ALL suites have 2 flatscreen tv's As we were late getting to our room and had dinner reservations we showered, changed and left. On return we noticed the room was filthy, there had been a drink sprayed up the wall, with run marks down the cupboard, the carpet was filthy, stained and the cupboard that held the bar fridge was rotten and had a huge stain across the front. The next morning we contacted conceirge and told them how revolting the room was, they finally found another room at 3.30pm after several calls to find out how much longer it would be. This new suite was at the noisy street end of the hotel, we finally got the nice flat screen tv, but unfortunately couldn't hear them due to the traffic noise and wind rushing through the unsealed window!!! They said yes the noise is a problem in this room, we are happy to put you back in the old room, I said great, could you ask housekeeping to at least clean the sprayed drink of the wall, nope still there! Remember we had booked there top suite, separate lounge, we were hoping to watch a few movies, room service etc Be warned once you past the glitter of the reception area, its old, dirty, stained and no where near 5 star. Thank goodness we book great restaurants outside the hotel as they saved our wedding anniversary weekend. Thank you Aria, Pendolino and Black by Ezard - great food and service. The staff were apologetic but really did nothing to fix things, when I showed the porter the drink sprayed up the wall and all over the carpet, his response was that is disgusting!

The food was really first class. We could not fault one thing with our meals. The new Spring Menu was innovative with lots of choices. There were two small suggestions about the bathroom which we did tell reception about on our departure. The taps in the shower had no colour or markings on the hot and cold taps. Because it took a long time for the hot water to come hot, we thought we had the cold tap on and vice versa. This could have been a very bad thing for either a young person or an old person as once the hot water came on, after several tries, it was very hot! The towel rails were far too small to allow the towels to be easily hung onto after use and because the towels were very luxurious and thick it did not allow them to dry out over night. However this is the first hotel we have stayed in that had the card saying if you want to use them again hang them up and the cleaner actually took notice. It is annoying when one wants to save the environment but are given clean towels every day.

Room: We booked through hotel website, as always. We booked the luxury room for $360 per night got courtyard views on level 14. Room is bigger than I thought, 28sqm is pretty small compared to other 5 star hotels around but the furnishing and luxurious beds make up for it you dont even notice. The bathroom has nice rich beige marble tones, again very modern interior. Cleanliness: Very very clean, from the furniture, to the carpet, to the bed. Everything you would expect from a 5 star. Bedding: Like i said before when I stayed at sofitel broadbeach, I stand by my first statement, \"Sofitel has the best beds so far, compare to any other 5 stars hotel I've stayed at. Expensive, quality beds used for sure! Service & Concierge: Our bathroom light was flickering so my partner called front desk to get that fixed, and you know what, there wasa knock on our door no less than 5 minutes and the handyman did his thing for like 2 minutes and went. Talk about express handyman service. Concierge, what can I say. Nick who is the concierge there was very professional and seems like his been working in his field for years. Not only was he knowledgeable but very very polite and well mannered. I was looking for a steak house near by after looking up a few on our laptop and we wanted a third opinion. Called up nick, he knew alot about the steakhouses around but also recommended us to the hotel gardencourt restaurant and offered to send us a menu to our room. Again less than 5 minutes a knock on our door and someone was there to give us the menu. After careful consideration we called up Nick to book for 7.30pm, and was told he would call us back in 5 minutes to confirmed. When he called us in less than 5 minutes, he advised us that there was no availability at 7.30pm only 7.15pm and 7.45pm, by the time I called to ask for him to book it, it would of been 7.10pm. Nick advised that he knew we wouldnt make it to 7.15pm so he put us down for 7.45pm. That incidently made me impressed, a concierge that thinks ahead and for the the guest and by that time I wasnt even ready yet so 7.45pm. I hope hotel management also notices his friendly and professional service to guest. And yes I will remember this concierge cause he was really really pleasant and because of him we will definitely becoming back...(after ive done my 5 star hotel tour in sydney). So thanks Nick!! Gardencourt Restaurant: Mmmmm yum yum yum, atmosphere? hits the romantic spot with cupids arrow, what can I say. You walk in and you can tell this place is Expensive, sophisticated, luxurious, professional. The interior is out of this world, very classic, very intimate, come on fellas lets take your girlies here. Staff greets you in french, and is very professional. Now I hear from time to time that when people go to restaurant they say the staff are snobby this and that. Now I always take a closer look, to me its not that they are snobby its taking into consideration that because you are working in such a upscale place, the staff need to maintain that professionalism, also having some personality and well mannered because its very easy to get to personal with guest and than lose some of that professionalism. Thats what it felt like at the Gardencourt Restaurant. Food was great and you know what, actually well priced considering that you do have other great fine dining options around and outside the hotel. Meals came out quick, well portioned and service was good. Those Yamba prawns as an entree were yummos!!! Me and my partner only had entree, mains and sides and drinks. Dessert i just wanted to go to Guylian at circular quay. So restaurant is very good. Views: The only thing that you wont get with Sofitel are views of harbour, city skyline or anything like that like other 5 star hotels. You do get court yard views which is probably not that appealing to alot of you guys. BUT Sofitel execs or managers probably know this and thats why they focus on other selling points, service, luxurious and beautiful lavish interiors and beds. Internet & Facilities: Our booking included free wifi and internet usage so hell yeah we brought our laptop, but they do give you a limit amount of data of only 1gig, but who cares, your there to enjoy the hotel or whatever you have plan. The reason we brought our laptop cause it was useful to search for things to do, restaurants and most importantly, YES facebook, saves us from using our phones. Internet is very fast and easy to hook up. Check Out: Fast fast fast, no complaints. Overall & Value: Fantastic stay, certainly a memorable stay and I actually stayed up and wrote a letter to management tellling them how much we enjoyed the stay. $360 per night for a luxury room on a high level floor, courtyard views + free internet & wifi? why not. Come on guys, give it a go.

Bathroom was large and clean but such an old bath with minor damage to the enamel, small holes where taps had been repaired and repairs at edge of bath. Nice toiletries. Bed was okay but sheets had small in holes in them. Good selection in mini bar (we didn't use it though as prices were higher than most). Tea, coffee sachets as expected but cups were ancient, one white and one cream colored, not matching. Silver teaspoons had plating coming off the ends. Small Lobby Bar was really nice with good food (we had lunch meals and drinks later at night). Our coffee, tea and wine came with tiny cookies and chocolate which made it special. Staff at Bar were friendly. Check in was good; our bags were dropped off by my husband and held while I attended a course and came back later to fully check in. Checkout was efficient considering there was a queue. It was an overnight stay only but comparing it with a 5 star hotel very nearby I stayed at a month ago, it was disappointing.

We like to have tea and bikkies in the morning - there was some tea and long life milk, but no biscuits - just a pet hate! There was also no offer of nor delivery of morning newspaper. As we left in the evening to meet the family, there must have been something wrong with three of the 4 lifts. We waited for 5 minutes or more to be collected from the 10th floor. When we eventually arrived at the reception level there were lots of people waiting to go up. Service was somewhat superficial - they went through the motions at the arrival desk and during checkout; lobby staff muttered some French greeting on a arrival, but there was no gushing welcome, no offer to take bags - no-one to open taxi doors when we returned mid-evening. It was all a bit 'matter of fact'. (I personally find the French greeting in this Sydney, Australia location almost irksome or vexatious. Ok the property has a French connection but come on! I don't expect a \"G'day mate how are yer?\", but a \"Good evening sir, madam\" is more appropriate than a French greeting!) In conclusion, it was okay to get the head down for the night, but presentation and service was tired and disappointing for a 5 star property.", "Date": "August 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Gold Coast", "Title": "\u201cExcellent accommodation\u201d", "Author": "Posted by an Accorhotels.com traveler", "ReviewID": "UR117334906", "Content": "We found this hotel to be excellent in every regard.

On arriving at the hotel in our car, we were instructed from across the road that the car park was around the back. As you could probably understand, on a busy Sydney Street on a Friday afternoon this was quite difficult to understand from across the road and as this was my first visit, a few more instructions would have been helpful. Anyway I decided to (against instructions from hotel employee) to pull up in the front driveway to unload luggage etc. I was again told that I could not park there and that valet parking was around the back. After some discussions with said employee I was informed that he did not wish to fight with me as I am a guest of the hotel. Very noble of him I thought..... By the way they insist they are 5 star but you still have to drive your car around the back to the carpark where you hand your keys to a third party, separately run carpark. Back upstairs to the foyer where we check in. Given the key and room number, we proceed to go up to our room where the key does not work. Back downstairs we go and we are informed by a different member of the reception team that we were told the wrong room number. On receipt of the correct room number we return back upstairs where we manage to open the door and we enter our room. Finally!!!! The room itself is not too bad although we have stayed in much better, but the bathrooms are very small with the shower over the bath. I really don't like this I have to say but understand space is a critical issue for city hotels. The bed is quite comfortable and the room itself clean. The television is incredibly small though. Our room was cleaned on the Saturday with the previous nights champagne flutes placed outside our room by housekeeping for collection by someone. This was along with breakfast trays etc from other rooms as well. This along with a dirty t/shirt or something were littering the corridors until well into the evening on our return from dinner on the Saturday night. This is not good enough from a 5 star hotel to leave dirty trays and dishes in the corridors for a full day before removal. One last thing is we found out you cannot ring down and have your car brought up for you so it there waiting for you. You have to make your way down to the carpark and ask the attendants there to bring it up for you. Then you wait. Also don't expect them to book a taxi for you as we were told it would be best if we went across the road to the taxi rank. This was ok as there were taxis waiting I simply say this to indicate the level of service and willingness to help by the staff. Overall it was a disappointing stay and we never really felt like we were valued guests of the hotel.

Location: Yes the location is fairly central. 7 min walk down hill to The Rocks area and Pitt St for shopping, less than 10mins in a taxi to the Casino and Darling Harbour area. Airport is normally around 25mins in good traffic. Reception: The lobby area smells fantastic with a lovely perfumed fresh smell. No concierge or porters to help on arrival. Check in was fairly friendly, however explained hotel was room after I asked if any paid upgrades were available. (Booked the Superior Room, which is one above the standard room) Lifts: Lifts were quick, however available to anyone to use, as you didn't need to use your card to swipe in to your particular floor level Rooms: The initial room we were given was filthy...stains all over the carpet and very dusty. A quick call to reception put us in the same room next door which was cleaner. The rooms are very basic for Sofitel standard and more of a Holiday Inn feel than a Luxury hotel. Small desk, ottoman, 24inc flat screen tv, all cheapish made wood furnishings. The bed and pillows are always the highlight of any Sofitel stay and as usual...comfortable, fluffy and a delight to sleep in/on. The blinds had a weird handle that you had to use quite a bit of arm strength to wind up and down...this was a nuisance every time I wanted to see some light. We had a tiny balcony overlooking the inner courtyard. Bathroom was very small....shower over bath, one basin, Roger and Gallett amenities...it always surprises me that Sofitel rarely supply toothpaste as other 5 star hotels do. Linen was fresh and changed regulary and rooms serviced quickly. Rooms not that quiet and you can hear noise from rooms up in the halls. Room Service: Ordered at midnight and took around 30mins. Delicious burger and icecream dessert. Typical prices. Small mini bar...very tired looking plastic jug, one bathrobe, no slippers, dirty lint brush, iron and ironing board. All in small cupboards. Fridge was looking tired (old white) however cold. Had afternoon tea, however was totally full so had it in the library. One TINY scone, and I do mean tiny, however waitress was lovely and did her best though we were far away from the main area. Choice of newspapers in the morning and check out is at 11am. Concierge: Some were helpful, some dissapeared when they saw someone approaching them. We hailed taxis ourselves. They were not overly helpful. Internet: 2 Hours for $10 or $28 for 24 hours of Wifi. Found it hard to get service in the room without buying the Wifi, but made do by going outside or downstairs. Day Spa: Adjoining Latouff Spa and Facial was fantastic and great service. This was a good idea back in the day. It is very dated apart from the lobby and the rooms are in major need of an overhaul at the prices they are charging. Wouldn't stay again, and if you are a fan of the Melbourne Sofitel, this is a very poor distant cousin twice removed!", "Date": "July 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "melb", "Title": "\u201cgreat pillows\u201d", "Author": "Posted by an Accorhotels.com traveler", "ReviewID": "UR115735949", "Content": "great location and the attention to detail is one of the best ive stayed in the pillows are great and if you spend a lot of time in hotels you know that this is the deal breaker the room was small but fantastic", "Date": "July 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney", "Title": "\u201cVery central\u201d", "Author": "Posted by an Accorhotels.com traveler", "ReviewID": "UR115649154", "Content": "Standard rooms are a bit pokey-recommend ugrading to Club Sofitel.Didn't require dinner after drinks and canapes!

Rooms are of adequate size and well laid out. Beds and pillows were excellent but there was no top sheet so either the doona or nothing. The mini bar was well stocked. TV was very small and the channel selection basic. Only one robe was supplied. Well appointed bathroom but it was cramped in the shower and there were rusty coloured stains on some of the tiles. Towels were of excellent quality. Our problem was with our Pre-theatre Dinner Package advertised on the hotel website and booked for 6pm. We arrived at about 6.05 and were seated immediately. During the ordering process the Maitre'd advised politely there wasn't any such dinner package and I must have confused the \"Quick Lunch\". Our waitperson agreed. We proceeded to order a single course as we were advised that two courses before the theatre was a possibility but not a certainty. Our friend checked using his blackberry and there it was. We showed this to the maitre'd suggesting the website should be updated. He came back to our table shortly after with a nicely printed menu he had found for the \"Pre-theatre Dinner Package\". He apologised that he was a replacement. But what of the waitperson? Were they new too? We were asked what could be done for us but it was too late to change anything. As it was, our single course arrived at 7.20. The food was excellent and the staff unfailingly polite, but the experience was well below expectations. The cocktail bar was closed when we arrived back from the theatre at 11pm even though it is open \"till late\". Breakfast in the restaurant was excellent. Checkout was easy.

( The Hotel itself has weathered the years very well and still holds the title quite possibly as the largest brick building in the Southern Hemisphere ) Whilst it may have been overtaken by newer flasher competitors this hotel does promise and for the most part delivers a solid higher end hotel experience. Situated in a quieter corner of the CBD it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a 10 to 15 min walk to most CBD attractions including areas such as Darling Harbour, Chinatown, The Rocks, Opera House and Botanic Gardens. Its secluded but not out of the way instead situated in between areas populated heavily by hotels, The location would be ideal for the corporate traveller during the week but this likewise means deals are to be had here on weekends. Arrival and Check in her was fast and friendly. Someone offered to take my bags as I got out of the Taxi ( nice touch not always found in hotels these days even at the top end ) And in a few mins I was at my room. The room I had for 1 night was not the biggest nor smallest hotel room I have seen. Given the age of the building the room was very modern and quite functional, They designers went for a clean, bright, simple layout as opposed to trying to get too creative. There was plenty of hanging space, a single recliner lounge, adequate desk space for working, The TV was on the smaller side of standard for most I have seen but usable never the less. There was rectangular picture window with a view of the street that finished off the space. The bathroom was small but very well designed to give as much space as possible, Reasonably well stocked with Hotel Premiums including Loccitaine soups and shampoo. Not as good as Pullman Brand Hotels but still adequate all the same. The Shower Hose however looked quite worn and didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t function properly and the glass shower screen could have done a better job. A few extra bath towels would have been nice but generally not too bad overall. The Hotel features several bars, A Sofitel Club Lounge, Its own shopping arcade ( nothing amazing ) and the very respectable Garden Court Restaurant ( The Garden Court brands itself as contemporary French but is more general in some respects with a reasonable grill menu to compliment some pretty reasonable French offerings. ( The bouillabaisse was very good the Foie Gras salad was okay though a little frugal on the foie gras I felt the only real failing would have been how long it took the bread and dip starter to arrive and the absence of any truly chocolate desert at the end of the meal ) The Bar does a very good job with Cocktails excellent Daiquiris and the wine list is very extensive. Service was attentive and friendly all the way thru. I would go back to this restaurant again its was really quite good. The lobby bar is governed by some quite silly laws so it closes about 1am, Tough luck if you want a cocktail. This however is not so much the Hotels fault as the stupid laws that govern the serving of alcohol in Sydney these days. Overall this is a nice Hotel its nothing that is going to stop the world and make you count the days until you come back, but its a solid offering and certainly better than its Melbourne Counterpart ( Sofitel on Collins ) and worthy of its place in what is a very competitive hotel marketplace.", "Date": "May 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Newcastle", "Title": "\u201cRelax\u201d", "Author": "Posted by an Accorhotels.com traveler", "ReviewID": "UR109860204", "Content": "The room was fantastic and the service from the staff exceptional.

Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t miss it! Bad I stay at hotels on a very frequent basis for work and pleasure, and I can stay without a shadow of a doubt, the Sofitel Sydney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s front desk staff are the worst I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve dealt with in years. Though staff were attentive, they were uninterested in guest satisfaction. When something went wrong, you may have been lucky to get a nonchalant \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsorry\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, but that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s it. For example, we checked into a superior room and before bed noticed unmentionable bodily fluids caked on the tiles behind the toilet, as well as a light red splatter {resembling blood} on the interior bathroom door. A further red drop under the closet and dark scratches on the white walls were unsettling too. We told 3 different staff members about this during the course of our stay and NOBODY bothered to take any money off the bill. In fact, at check-out, we had to firmly request they take money off given the bodily fluids adorning our bathroom and in the end they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t take off much. Also, prior to my check-in to the hotel, I emailed them to let them know that I was going to be checking in early, advising that an early check-in would be appreciated if space was available. When we got the hotel after a 16-hour flight, there were no rooms available in the room class we booked, so instead of offering us a complimentary upgrade which is a fairly normal practice in hotels, they said the only way we could get immediate occupancy, was by paying an extra $40 night to upgrade rooms {many of which appeared to be available}. So if this is their normal practice, why couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t they have told me this in the email I sent? We even inquired if they could tell us when something came available, but they simply said no, come back at 2pm. They could have also offered us the opportunity to freshen up in their health club facilities, but were not interested in this option either. It was their way or the highway, no compassion or helpfulness. What to Know - Wireless is charged hourly up to $27 per 24-hours - Circular Quay is the closest rail stop for catching the train around town or to the airport - If you call a Sydney mobile phone from the room\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s phone, they charge you $3.50/minute, a charge they are not forthcoming about. When we explained this to the gentleman who checked us out, he said, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re right, sorry, but then charged us anyway. Again, poor service. - The hotel calls themselves a 5-star, but the facilities, amenities and rooms are 4-star at best. The rooms\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 design motif is generic contemporary and the sizes are small. Save yourself the time and stress. Stay elsewhere in Sydney if you value customer basic customer service.

If there was one, we never found it and when I looked out the window in the morning I didn't see any balconies on the floor we were on. I'm torn about the room. In some ways I think this is one of the best designed rooms I have ever been in. The bathroom was small but perfectly formed. There was enough room to swing a cat, but probably not enough to swing a larger dog. That's ok, we didn't bring any pets. :) The room is perfect for a single night stay or perhaps a couple of nights. If you were staying any longer the lack of a lounge might begin to get annoying. There was a couple of chairs, one for the desk and one for sitting in. A lounge could easily have been fitted in, if the space on either side of the windows was not taken up with very large cabinets with lighting and glass shelves which hold one (dusty) vase each. I am baffled as to the purpose of those cabinets. There was quite a lot of cabinets already in the room across from the bathroom, there was a cupboard, the mini bar, and a small benchtop with a kettle and some snacks all of which was hidden behind cupboards. Do people staying in 5 star hotels bring along their own knick knacks which they wish to display in their hotel room? :) If you are reading this review and you want to bring along your own knick knacks and display them, the Sofitel is your best bet! We went out for dinner, walking down to The Rocks which was not far and was mostly downhill. Note that we are people who like to walk a lot while on holiday, for us it was a short stroll but for non-walkers it might be a bit further than they would like. On the way back we stopped for gelato at Circular Quay which was a happy accident - after we left we discovered the next street up from the gelato place was Philip St which is the street the hotel is on. The walk back to the hotel up that particular street is uphill for the most part. Again that was no problem for us. BTW Gelatissimo was the name of the gelato place, it was awesome, a great range of gelato and sorbets. If you walk down Philip St to Circular Quay, you will find the place quite easily and I highly recommend it. Back to the hotel, and we sat in the lobby for a while chatting with our friends. The perfume down there is just so awesome. A previous reviewer (Mattalie) mentioned that she thought it was Chanel Allure Sensuelle - the next day when we were out exploring Sydney's shops, I picked up a tester of that perfume and sprayed a card with it. I don't know if that is the perfume Sofitel uses or not, though I do think it smells similar, but I do know that I will have to buy a bottle of that perfume because it is incredible. :) Our friends from the states mentioned how expensive the internet was in the hotel - I think they said $27 for 24 hours but we were not there for long enough to investigate or try it ourselves. I guess being Aussie we're more used to being charged big fees for the internet in hotels - and everywhere else! Upstairs and to bed. On arrival in the room we discovered staff had been in while we were gone to turn down the bed, lay the floor mat in the bathroom, leave laundry bags on the bed and also to leave a breakfast menu with pillow chocolates! That was a nice touch. The bed is like lying on a white fluffy cloud. The pillows are a bit too soft for me - and sadly there wasn't a pillow menu like some other hotels I have stayed in - one of those was the Novotel Oasis at Cairns which is an Accor hotel. So that was a little surprising as this hotel is meant to be a step up from that one. I did notice some level of noise from fellow guests - mainly people lifting up the toilet lid which is very heavy and tends to clang on the marble when you raise it. I slept very well as did the other half. In the morning there was traffic noise which is to be expected in the middle of Sydney though perhaps not to be expected inside a 5 star hotel. I know it is possible to completely stop noise from the outside, airport hotels manage it nicely. But perhaps with this heritage building it may not have been possible. Down to Breakfast, where the other half ordered cappuccino ($6 each for a very small cup! egads!) and I ordered a mushroom omelette from the egg chef. It was lovely. The smoothie of the day in a shot glass was amazing, the pastries were great, the juice was cold and refreshing and there seemed to be an excellent selection of items to choose from. An excellent start to the day, however I would wait till later for your cappuccino because $6 will buy you quite a large cup of coffee in most coffee places in Sydney. Back to the room and in the cold light of day, it wasn't quite as spotless as it seemed at night time. Maybe I am a bit picky because I've been a cleaner myself but the cover to the exhaust fan on the ceiling in the bathroom was very dirty and there were odd stains on the ceiling in the bathroom as well as the blind in the bedroom. Looked a bit like red wine stains. At checkout there is a 1.5% surcharge for credit cards. I tried to pay via debit card (visa debit but I can use the savings option on eftpos) but the hotel had placed a hold on funds in my account making it impossible for me to get around the surcharge. Unfortunately I ended up having to pay by Visa because they were unable to undo the hold right away. Had I know this, I would have preferred to pay for the room with my debit card on check in and not had a hold placed on the account. They had the credit card number, and they would have been able to charge extras to it if necessary. The hold was also for $80 more than the room charge, which was not awesome. So that might want to be something you clarify with them on check in - however the hotel should be letting guests know about that. Many hotels just want to have the number on file in case something happens, they don't put a hold on funds. We left our bags with the concierge while we went wandering around Sydney for a few hours. When we returned we got the bags quickly and easily and headed down to the carpark to pick up the car, which was also an easy and quick process. Overall, as wonderful as the hotel smelled and as comfortable as the beds were, I don't think we would stay here again. There are a lot of great 5 star hotels in Sydney many of which we have stayed at previously - we would revisit those before we stayed at the Sofitel again.", "Date": "April 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne, Australia", "Title": "\u201cGive it a miss\u201d", "Author": "CJACCM", "ReviewID": "UR104103849", "Content": "We waited 15 min to check in to our confirmed rooms only to be advised not available We were traveling with children under 10yrs and had specifically requested connecting rooms for obvious reasons.

We arrived at around 4pm, walked to the room, found a vacuum cleaner lying in the passage and a tray of half eaten food outside a door. They were still there we we returned around 11pm. The room was a disgrace. Stained carpets, a tiny flat screen TV that could not be viewed from the bed and we had to draw up a chair to watch a movie. Small bathroom, no separate shower stall, just an inefficient shower over the bath with a cheap curtain. This despite the elegant plaque explaining the amazing features of the circular design. The linen was nothing like the previous rooms, not much better than motel or hospital grade. 3 pillows instead of 4. The bed was adequate - not like the great pillow-top one in the Superior (cheaper) room. The unit containing the fridge had a particle board vertical divider that had obviously been in serious contact with water and it was split and bulging. This is NOT 5 Star quality. The Club Lounge was good, the food adequate and the service staff pleasant. When I commented about the poor standard of the room the duty manager immediately went to the computer, typed in a few words and told me that she was so sorry about the quality she would be deleting the upgrade charge and the account was zeroed. Checked my MasterCard today and found that I had been billed $75.00 the day we arrived and a further $69.50 the following day. We bought a movie and had a chocolate bar and a small tub of cashews.

The lobby was beautiful, but so heavily perfumed that several of us could barely breathe. The room was attractive, but the bed was hard. We were given only a duvet (couette) and no top sheet, which was too warm to sleep under. We requested a top sheet from the maid on the first morning, and didn't get it. We requested a sheet again from the front desk that evening, and it was delivered promptly. The bathroom was small (as was the room), but beautifully updated. The staff was friendly and the buffet breakfast was the standard British version. As Americans, we are not thrilled with undercooked bacon and scrambled eggs. The biggest issue we faced was the elevator nightmare. Only 2 elevators ever appeared to be working, one making very alarming creaking and groaning noises. In the mornings both days we were there the elevators did not arrive for at least 10 minutes, and when they did they were jammed with people with suitcases. Since the lobby is on the ground floor, another main entrance one floor below, and the breakfast restaurant is on the third floor, with blocked stairways when you tried to walk up, this was terrible. Several people we talked to on the elevator (when we finally got on one) had ridden down to 3 trying to check out, only to have the elevator go back up instead of descending to the lobby. It took about 25 minutes to get from the 10th floor down to the 3rd, and then about the same to get back up. The trip down to the lobby with hand luggage to check out took longer. There were people in a panic about trying to catch flights...including airline crews. We resorted to catching an up elevator and riding to the top to get to the bottom. Staff took pity on some of our group and let them ride service elevators. This is just not what I would expect from a 5 star hotel. We accidentally left a battery charger in our room when we checked out, and called that evening when we discovered the loss.

Room service was comparatively better \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I had the nicoise salad which had a very generous serving of salmon and the creme brulee which was served in a flan dish! Facilities As my stay was quite long (2 weeks), I was disappointed to find out that the hotel (although 5 star) did not have a pool. The front desk explained that this is because the hotel building is a heritage building and they were not allowed to install a pool. The gym is also a separately operated gym in the shopping arcade below the hotel. The equipment is not bad although packed a little too tightly together for my liking. Also, suggest you check and double check the opening hours of the gym \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the front desk had given me the wrong information causing me to be kicked out of the gym mid-run. Others I don't know if it is standard across Australia but I was charged 2% extra for settlement via credit card. Do other patrons really settle by cash? Why would I carry around AUD2600 of cash? Overall, not happy with my stay at Sofitel Wentworth. Finally, I sign off with a quirky anecdote: I requested for a smoking room when making the booking. The hotel emailed me to say they will try to accommodate it. Upon check in, front desk informed me that there are no smoking rooms but they will give me a room with a balcony and I can smoke out there. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have an ashtray, but I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to flick/ditch my butts (especially since there would be quite a number of them over the course of 2 weeks!). I stupidly placed them in a cup inside the room. The next day, the cleaning lady left me a note by the bedside table warning \u00e2\u20ac\u0153your room is a nonsmoking room. My supervisor said if I found ash or butts in the room I shall report it and you will be fined\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more, the note was written in Chinese.

We did have something in our mini fridge that smelled like a dead animal every time we opened it and couldn't figure out what it was. When we called to have someone come take a look, the man that came actually smelled worse than a dead animal. All he did was wipe some condensation from the bottom of the fridge, and left. We decided keeping the fridge closed was a better option than having him come back into our room again.", "Date": "February 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kingscliff", "Title": "\u201cWeekend getaway\u201d", "Author": "Posted by an Accorhotels.com traveler", "ReviewID": "UR97493861", "Content": "Service by staff was excellent..

If you are doing alot of tours from circular quays, its not the closest hotel but the walk does you good, especially going back, as its uphill, which may put some people off. I booked this hotel through wotif mystery hotel and was hoping for one closer to the quays. Dont expect a fantastic room when booking this way and I wouldnt suggest booking a mystery hotel myself again. We stayed for 4 nights and the first night we were in the classic room which is the smallest and we found it too small and clostraphobic, so we paid extra and upgraded to the superior room which had about an extra 1/2metre in width which did make a difference. Dont expect a view, as the hotel is jammed up in the middle of other taller buildings and thats all the view you got, not sure if the suites / penthouses had views or not. We had some issues with bedding but this was resolved quickly and efficiently. The Gym which i didnt attend, but my husband went to, said was large and very well equipped. I dont think they had a pool, we didnt have time to look into this. The room was made up and serviced each day and even when we went for breakfast there on the sunday morning for an hour, in that time they had come in and made the bed etc, i was impressed. The buffet breakfast was very nice and freshly made when asked for an omelete etc. The floor manager came by twice while we were seated to ask us if everything was ok. We did feel a need for a 1 bedroom apartment with kitchen and laundry facilities for a stay that long, but we managed with the hotel room. Also a very nice touch from the Guest relations manager was that not long after we arrived in our room, they had sent up a bottle of champagne and strawberries for our anniversary. Some maitenance needed, the first room we were in, the seat was broken, and in the bathrooms the tiles in some areas were mouldy / black in the grouting, but lovely all over as they were marble up the walls, the only thing i didnt like was that the shower was over the bath, a bit outdated i thought. The bed was fantastic, 1 king or 2 singles together, but it was so roomy, with feather top on the mattress and feather doona/pillows, i had the best sleep ever. When we moved rooms the bed didnt have these but they obliged and remade the bed with these extras, much appreciated. One thing I didnt like is when my husband was waiting at the counter to drop something off, the staff said to him that the workman behind him was next, i thought that guests would have come first.

Anyone who reads my previous reviews will know I'm not in the business of nitpicking. But if a five star property is going to relieve you of a large amount of money and then subject you to the discomfort we suffered, then it deserves to be eviscerated. We were given a superior room - Room 639 - on checkin so this wasn't even standard fare. The room itself was bright and serviceable, though with an LCD television that was so small it was barely viewable from the bed. But the problems began when we checked out the bedding. A thick duvet and no sheet. Hello? The temperature was 41 degrees in Sydney on February 5th so the idea of languishing under a duvet, no matter how low the air conditioning, was hardly appealing. We rang housekeeping. No answer. We rang reception. \"We'll pass on the message to housekeeping. We'll get a sheet to you shortly\". Two hours passed. We rang housekeeping. No answer. We rang reception. \"Oh, sorry I'll get onto it straight away\". An hour later, we went out, expecting the find the sheet in our room when we returned. Six hours later, still no sign of it. I rang reception and angrily said I would check out in 15 minutes if we didn't get a sheet. It finally arrived, eight hours after the first request. This is incredible in a competitive five star market like Sydney. But it was when we were finally in bed that things really deteriorated. The \"king bed\" is made up of two twins, both of which sagged in the middle in a way that I've only ever struck in the worst doss houses in Africa or the Middle East. We barely slept and arose nursing pains in the lower back. I called the Duty Manager, wanting to show him just how bad the bed was. He arrived with another Duty Manager called Mohammed who proceeded to tell us that there was nothing wrong with the bed, a statement that provoked incredulity and anger from us after our appalling ordeal. \"But you can see the sagging in the middle on both beds!\" \"Oh that's Sofitel's \"My Bed\". If you don't like it, you should have taken off the top layer of feathers\". \"But you can see the bed itself is sagging. So much so that we've both got sore backs and barely slept\". \" I'm sorry, we'll look into it after you've left but I can't see anything wrong with it\", was the response. We checked out soon afterwards, determined not to spend another cent in a hotel that treats its guests with such disdain. Believe me, the Sofitel Wentworth is a disgrace, except perhaps as the setting for a bad movie you might call \"Sleepless in Room 639\". And if the Sofitel \"My Bed\" is a feature of this chain globally, then its Accor owners are sadists for inflicting it on the travelling public and masochists if they enjoy it themselves.

I drove to the Wentworth street entrance and battled with taxis to park in the drop-off/pick-up point. Went inside to be told that I would have to drive around to the rear of the building to use the car-park and valet service. Finally got inside and I upgraded to the 'Club Sofitel' on offer. The front desk didn't bother telling us that there was a 'happy hour' ongoing in Club Sofitel lounge so being unaware of this we chose to have a drink outside the Hotel so missed out on 'happy hour'. The room was OK but didn't have any ice in the fridge. I inquired a passing staff member about an ice machine on the floor but was told that I would have to go to the ground floor bar or ring room service. I chose to go downstairs only to be given a glass of ice - not an ice bucket, just a single glass containing about 6 ice cubes! Meanwhile, my partner asked reception about an alternate latex pillow as she doesn't like feather pillows only to be told that the pillow she wanted had quote \"Run out\" unquote and none were available. No one was answering the house keeping phone by the way. Next morning, we went to breakfast and as per normal practise and habit, I displayed my Advantage Plus card only to be told that it was invalid in Club Sofitel and that to use it, I would have to go to another meal area and pay for breakfast. I pointed out to the staff member that I had paid extra to be upgraded to Club Sofitel status so she checked a list and surprise surprise, there was my name!

At check in, we tried to upgrade, but were unable to as the hotel was heavily booked. The check-in guy told us that we were in a VIP room so it should be nice anyway. After seeing the room though, it was obvious that the \"VIP\" comment must be a line the hotel uses as there was nothing special about this room. The fabric on furniture had stains as did the carpet. The bathroom was full of mold. It was disgusting - mold at the back of the sink and around the shower. We stayed 2 nights only - Friday and Saturday night. There was a party in the hotel restaurant several floors below our room, but we could hear the music until early hours of morning. Not cool. The bed was somewhat comfortable (even though it was two single beds pushed together), but we could not sleep because of the booming music. The TV/Pay TV did not work the entire time we were there. The service guy came up several times. First he insisted we were not pressing the correct buttons on the remote (ridiculous). He ended up resetting the TV on more than one occasion but no luck... eventually he gave some lame reason why it wasn't working, blaming the pay TV provider. There is no excuse for this. There was one bathrobe in our room, and we needed two. There were no slippers. I called Housekeeping several times to ask for another bathrobe and 2 pairs of slippers but no one answered the Housekeeping line. So then I called Room Service, Concierge, Reception, etc. for about 20 minutes just to speak to someone... anyone... and no one answered. The lines just rang and rang. Finally, someone at reception answered and very pleasantly said she would have a bathrobe and 2 pairs of slippers sent to the room. An hour or so later we received 1 bathrobe but no slippers. Called again and the phone rang and rang. Finally, reception answered and I asked for the slippers again. Eventually they were delivered. Had the same issues with no one answering the phone when we called about the TV not working. The phone issues are beyond ridiculous. We both felt the cologne scent in the lobby was overwhelming. We ate at the hotel once and it was less than memorable. The positives: hotel staff were nice, and location was good. Concierge staff were helpful and gave good restaurant recommendations. This stay was one of the worst hotel experiences we've had in a long time. For $450 per night, I expect to at least have a clean room, without mold, and a TV that works.

I was with my wife and 4 year old daughter. I had bought 2 nights at the hotel in a charity auction and paid advantage plus rate of $330 for the third night. The hotel was fine but not sofitel good. It was more in line with the novotel standard rather than sofitel standard. That is in the room standards. The lobby and other common areas were very classy. Because we were travelling with our little one i rang the hotel when booking our nights to find out if a twin double beds room would sleep us all comfortably. I was assured that it would. We arrived late (11pm) on the first night and when we got up to our room we found that a double/double room is really 2 single beds not 2 double beds. Clearly we couldn't all sleep comfortably like that. I went back down to reception to enquire and was told that was their double/double room setup and I was asked if the 2 beds were pushed together. I confirmed that they were but they were made separately and that our little one wouldn't like sleeping on the crack between the 2 beds! To their credit they delivered up a rollaway bed for my daughter and there was no fee for that. Just a word of warning though that a double/double is really a single/single and 2 couples could not share a room with that bedding setup. We had complimentary bfast for the first 2 mornings and it was fine but not great. I definitely wouldn't pay $35 a head for it. The location of the hotel was ok. We walked down to circular quay to catch the ferry and the free CBD shuttle bus pulled up not far from the hotel if you didn't want to walk. There wasn't a lot in the way of restaurants around the hotel. There was a couple of coffee shops near the rear entrance of the hotel. The walk to Martin Place and the pitt st mall wasn't too far. The concierge was very helpful, assisting us with details of getting to taronga zoo, luna park etc. He also recommended an italian restaurant for us near Darling Harbour called Casa del Nico at which we dined saturday night and had a great meal. Checkout on sunday morning was frustarting. There was a very long line and a 25min wait. I think it was partly due to the arrival of an emirates flight crew checking in at what was checkout time for everyone else. I think this hotel would be a reasonable choice for business travel but not at full rack rate. The rooms and furnishings are a bit tired and there really isn't the facilities at the hotel to make it a good choice for an extended holiday stay.

Have travelled the world and this superb Hotel is by far one of the best. Not pretentious but totally elegant and worth every penny. Loved the garden for peace and quiet. Beds hugely comfy. Nespresso coffee machines in room were a treat. This place is like heaven one earth right in the middle of Sydney city.

PROS Central location - you can walk to Circular Quay and the hotel is in the CBD Decent rooms - the room was a little dated, but still quite nice. Comfortable Sofitel bed Glamourous lobby Helpful concierge Several restaurants and access to a health club. CONS Meals are overpriced. We found many staff to be rude - we came back to the hotel after a walk and in the elevator couldn't find our key, and a staff member came in and asked us to step out - he acted as though we were trespassing and was suspicious and rude, not helpful and understanding, even though we were hotel guests. He did not apologise to us. The shower smelled strongly of mould. The room decor is ok but a bit dated. The room was not cleaned properly. No swimming pool. No slippers - the marble bathroom is freezing cold on bare feet! Staff were condescending and unfriendly. We were asked to spell our surname three times and the staff member acted like we were irrirating her because she couldn't understand the spelling of our name. We were woken in the middle of the night by a fire alarm. We went outside and all the guests were in the hallway. There was no announcement and we did not know what to do. Eventually a man came along and told us to go back to our rooms, but there was no announcement. Obviously a fire or a fire drill is out of their control, but they should have made an announcement about what was happening, apologised for waking everyone up, and offered at least a free drink. Very poorly handled - some people may have evacuated. VERDICT This hotel was only just ok. It's probably ok for a business trip but if you are travelling for leisure and would to stay somewhere luxurious where you will be treated well, I recommend you look elsewhere. This did not feel like a 5 star experience. The staff ruined the experience for us. Usually staff at a 5 star hotel are well trained in hospitality. Most of the staff we encountered did not even smile and did not make us feel welcome. Almost everyone we spoke with was unfriendly. It seems they need basic training in customer service. At no stage did we feel that we were being treated well. We are not demanding but I did expect friendly service with a smile at a 5 star hotel.

It was like we'd fallen down Alice in Wonderland's tunnel because we'd entered a very special world of eating, drinking, more eating and drinking, and service that suggested we were VIPs (something my wife got used to very quickly). While I had been to the Sofitel for conferences and functions, so I was awre of the changes to the hotel, I hadn't seen other parts of the hotel since it was a rather ageing Sheraton. The level 5 Sofitel Club Lounge and Garden Court restaurant are obviously relatively new additions because I remember a rather cavernous buffet restaurant when it was a Sheraton. The Club Lounge is very stylish and we had drinks and pre-dinner nibbles before eating at Garden Court. What I did recall from the old days was the waiter - Claude - who told us that he'd been at the hotel since 1976 (I think) and apart from serving me about 10 or so years ago, he'd served the Queen, prime ministers and John McEnroe, who apparently was thrown out of the hotel for trashing his room. His service was very special and really made our meal. The menu was French-inspired, but light and modern, and quite reasonably priced for such 5-star surrounds. We managed two courses and felt as if we needed to walk the length of the city to recover, but when we got to our room there were chocolate covered strawberries, so what can a pair do but eat them? Fortunately the bed was remarkably comfortable - firm yet really enveloping if that makes any sense - and we slept like logs. We had to rescue the babysitter fairly early in the mornig so w didn't get to enjoy a long sleep-in, but a quick breakfast in the Club Lounge was a great way t finish our indulgent getaway. We didn't get to dance away the night in one of the night venues around Circular Quay, but that can be next time. Our package wasn't cheap but for a couple who don't get much \"quality time\" together, it was worth every dollar. I just need to work out how I can spirit Claude away from the Sofitel to be the maitre d' at our next dinner party.", "Date": "July 10, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney, Australia", "Title": "\u201cAn enjoyable evening away with great service\u201d", "Author": "l_gregory", "ReviewID": "UR70244885", "Content": "After reading many of the reviews posted recently, I was a bit concerned about my stay at the Sofitel.

Highly recommend this if your budget allows. Very good value for what you get. I do agree that the rooms are not quite up to 5 star standard and are very small in comparison.

As I was an Accor Advantage Plus Member and wanted a quality hotel I chose to stay here. My arrival in Sydney started off badly when I left the airport terminal by taxi. It was the ride from hell and the driver had no idea where the Sofitel was (but that's another story). My experience with this hotel did not get off to a good start. I arrived at the hotel after 4pm. I had to wait at least 15 minutes to be attended to by reception. When I was attended to I was advised that although my room was ready, I couldn't have access to it because it had to be checked first. I was told to take a seat and it would be ready soon. As I had friends to meet at 5pm I was keen to have access to the room so I could unpack, change and get ready to go out. I ended up waiting 45 minutes (this is no joke) until the room was ready for me. The room was clean and tidy and the bed was comfortable. Also there was no noise at all to speak of, which was a pleasant surprise as you usually have to put up with some noise at most hotels. However, the room was tiny by any standards let alone a 5 star hotel. Also there was virtually no natural light in this room. The room had a small window but the wall of a neighbouring building was right outside the window. My booking included the buffett breakfast for both mornings. On the Saturday morning I had no problem. However, on the Sunday morning when I went to the restuarant for breakfast I was told that my room number was not on the list. Instead of the restuarant staff sorting it out for me I was told to go down to reception and sort it out myself. I spoke to the manager and I told him who I spoke with when I made the booking. The on duty manager didn't seem to care but eventually said I would be okay to have the buffett breakfast. When I checked out I had a quick look at the bill before I paid. Surprise, surprise! I had been charged extra for Sunday's breakfast. I pointed this out to the young man at reception and told him that the manager (who just happened to be standing behind him with his back turned) knew all about this matter. The man at reception didn't even ask the manager (and the manager who was in earshot of this conversation didn't even turn around) he just deleted it off the bill.

The others were the Hilton and Sheraton on the Park. The Sofitel falls a long way short of both other hotels, although at the right price I would certainly stay there again. We have stayed here before in a Superior room, its worth the extra. We would normally upgrade to club benefits but didnt this time as our package included a full breakfast. My rating would have been different had we stayed in a higher grade room with club benefits but for this trip and this room here it is! The upside: The beds are supremely comfortable, the V shaped pillow from the pillow menu highly recommended. The room was VERY quiet, very impressive in a busy hotel. The breakfast buffet was very high quality and the range and options delicious, we sat and ate, reading the Sunday paper for ages. The location is great for business, access to the quay area, Macquarie Street and not bad for the shops. A fair hike to the train. On the downside: Our \"Classic Room was tiny. We have stayed here before in a superior room and they weren't a lot bigger. Bathroom was very small. Water flows so thinly from the shower head you struggle to get wet! Bathroom wasn't as clean as it could be. It was superficially clean but when I had a bath I noticed mould under the soap holder, a few bits of hair left from a previous guest and the side of the toilet wasnt very clean. I wouldnt have noticed any of these if I'd had a shower but being at bath level puts a whole new view on things! The TV is very small, more computer moniter sized, very little choice of channels The bathroom entrance is small so there is a strange door, slightly odd! There's a pillow menu, we rang and requested latex pillows at 4pm. They hadnt arrived at 9.30pm so we rang again, no latex pillows left so they sent an alternative which was very comfortable. Can be tricky to catch someone for coffee at breakfast. The checkin/out arrangement is a bit haphazard with the long semi-circular desk attended at various points, you just line up where you see someone, no particular order or cueing arrangement.

No, instead we were placed in a rack room rate room (having been told there were no upgrade rooms available as they were full) which was barely big enough to hold the bed and a small wooden desk! Very basic, felt like I was staying in a hostel! The bathroom light switch was faulty and complained to reception to fix it. After several calls, the electrician visited and suggested (tongue in cheek) we change to a 'better' room, as the power to the room would need to be removed to repair the switch! After a few squabbles to reception we were moved to an upgrade suite (surprise suddenly one becomes available!) which was much larger and way more stylish and comfortable! I would not recommend this hotel for the high price they want, it's close to circular Quay if you don't mind the uphill climb from the quay with your luggage, but the level of service, room quality and lack of other facilities like a decent gym or even a pool does not justify these prices.

I was told they did not so ate away, after about 10 minutes i started to feel very sick so opened up my food to see if anything did indeed contain prawns, i found a piece of prawn in my dumpling, i showed this to a staff member and asked her to make sure there was no prawn in the dumplings and she assured me there was not. it was a prawn and I ended up spending the rest of my time at the sofitel feeling extreamly unwell as well as the following week, not the way I had wished to start my marriage. The manager on duty was very nice about the situration although he did seem pretty preoccupied, we were refunded one nights stay, and the hotel paid for the doctor who came to give me injections for how sick I was feeling.

The accomodation part of our package was with the Sofitel Wentworth Sydney. The hotel itself is lovely, with the wonderful floral displays in the foyer, large rooms, comfy beds and an excellent position to sightsee. All of this great stuff was offset by the poor service experienced in the hotel restaurant. If the breakfast portion of our package hadn't been included after our first experience in the restaurant we would have dined elsewhere. Being that the hotel was a sponsor of the Military Tattoo it was to be expected that the dining room would have a large patronage and each morning there was a queue for breakfast. We were expecting this to be the case so it is not a part of our gripe. What is part of the gripe is the person who greeted us with not a \"good morning\" or \"may i please have your room number\" but \"what's your room number\". This was followed by much sighing, which gave the impression we were taking up a valuable portion of this person's day with our presence in the dining room. This was followed by a wave of the hand in the direction of a table covered with dirty dishes and linen and we were told go help ourselves to breakfast and by the time we came back to our table with our selection from the buffet it would be cleared. Then began the game of \"could we please have a cup of coffee/tea\"? If you were exceptionally lucky you would be able to snag one cup for the morning from a passing waiter/ess. The not so lucky went without, usually after quite a few requests. Don't bother looking for a second cup as that was never going to happen. Snagging a table with clean cutlery, crockery and napkins was a bonus. Three times in four days I had to request clean cups and napkins. The only shining light was a young lady named Frances who was trying to do the job of three people. You might think after the first experience you wouldn't go there for dinner, but my husband and I seemed to be suckers for punishment. As there was quite a bit of rain around we decided to have dinner in the restaurant one evening rather than chance the rain and get wet again. Thinking any restaurant that charged 5 star prices for a steak ($50) also be offering 5 star service to match would be a seriously bad move in this restaurant. While the restaurant was no-where near full, the service was again abysmal. Even the Chef was finding it hard to find staff to convey the meals from the cooking area to the tables. Never mind getting another drink. Sofitel my question is....where is your food and beverage manager? If he/she was on duty they obviously have no idea of what constitutes customer service i.e. the customer is more important than putting away cutlery and talking to your friends out the back.

Which suprised me as on first glance it seemed geared towards the business market, we stayed for leisure. The level of service provided by the staff is efficient and attentive which to us is the hallmark of a professionally run hotel. Check-in was easy, but not rushed, as it was moderately busy. On check-in we asked for a different bedding configuration from what we'd booked and the staff member happily changed us to another room. Arriving in the room the TV needed fixing as there was no signal, the maintance man was there in no time and was jovial in the vein of a typical Aussie larrikin (didn't think they were still in Sydney) and fixed it in seconds. We appreciated his good humour and individuality. We anticipated issues as our 3 year old daughter is noisy and busy. She was attentively fussed over by the restaurant staff, which was great as it made her quiet and shy, in turn making breakfast enjoyable for us adults. Perhaps, as we only saw one other child whilst at the hotel so the presence of a child may have been a novelty for the staff? Breakfast was included, we haven't stay in 5 star hotels much and were impressed with the buffet choices and the amount available. There was champagne available! Sleeping on the my-bed is supreme, I need one at home. The superior rooms have a lounge near the window which was a great place to read the paper, relax, play children's games. It added a positive spatial dimension to the room. Location for us was important as we like to us public transport, both Martin Place & Circular Quay train stations are within walking distance, although there is a moderate climb from the Quay back to the hotel. Walking to the Quay is leisurely. To and from Martin Place is almost level. The Botanical gardens are very close and a great place for kids to run, look at the flowers, ducks, statues etc. Being close to an area where kids can run, discover new things and just be kids influenced our choice on where to stay. But it rained a lot we only went there once and got soaked. We liked the atmosphere and staff's obvious commitment to their guest's needs. We loved the dinner room service menu and considered it reasonalby priced. Room service presentation was impecciable. My wife had the same pasta dish 3 times. The lack of a swimming pool was a major drawback and nearly prevented us from booking the Sofitel; kids love to swim. By chance it became a non issue as the rain would have curtailed our dreams of reclining by the pool.

There are two views available for this hotel which are the \"Garden Courtyard\" view (facing Phillip St) and the \"City Views\" (Facing Bligh St). Unfortunately, 4 rooms on every level of this hotel (that is 2 rooms at the end of each hallway) which are advertised and sold as \"Classic Rooms with City Views\" actually have a view of 3 brick walls running the height of the hotel meaning that there is absolutely no City View at all! My partner and I were so disappointed by the first room we were given as we could not see any sort of City View from the window (unless you count the sky if you look upwards?). We could not see anything at all as looking out of our window we were surrounded by 3 brick walls and the window of the other non-city view room. After further investigation we discovered that 4 Classic Rooms on every single floor of this hotel have such a view of 3 brick walls so after seeing a show and dinner with friends we requested a change of room so we were facing Bligh St (and so we actually had the view that we expected and paid for). The lady on duty that night gave us attitude because we did not request a change of room straight away (gee, sorry for having pre-made plans but we didn't have time to line up and explain the situation as we had tickets to a show) but she agreed that the room we were given did not have any view at all. The second room we were given was what we expected in terms of the city view that was advertised but the broken tray/shampoo stand in the bathroom, the small stains on the linen and cold room service food are just little things that added to our disappointment of the stay. I would like to ask management of the hotel why the 4 rooms at the end of the hallway on every floor are advertised as \"City View\" when clearly all the staff know that there is no view at all from these room as they face each other and brick walls but still charge the same price for these undesirable rooms? Fair enough if these rooms were a bit cheaper but they cost the same as the rooms facing Bligh St (and with a view) so who would be happy staying in a room which felt like a prison? I'm not blaming the staff as most of them were nice enough and helpful but the fact that we had to argue to get a room with a city view that we paid for did dampen our holiday mood so we would not recommend this hotel to our friends as there are many other similar hotels in the same area which hopefully really are up to 5 star standard. This hotel is very old but has been refurbished but it is far from 5 star luxury, don't let the pictures on their website and nice entrance foyer fool you. We also dined at the Garden Court restaurant, the food was nice but the waitress mixed up the \"medium rare\" request for the steak and \"well done\" request for the fish so I sent my fish back to be recooked.

It is located on Phillip Street, close to the NSW Parliament, the Royal Botanic Gardens, and Circular Quay. I had a Luxury Club Sofitel Room (Rm 1735) on the top floor of the hotel, on a corporate rate of approx $280. Valet: As I drove, I used the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s valet carpark, which is operated by Premier Parking on behalf of the hotel (charge $39.60 per night \u00e2\u20ac\u201c multiple in/out privileges). You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll need to use not the front entrance of the hotel, but the Bligh Street entrance of the hotel. The parking attendants will call down a porter for you if needed. Service was fast and efficient, but I opted not to wait for a porter. Didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to wait long to claim car either. No issues, and parking rate was reasonable for Sydney. Porter: I dropped my bag and suit carrier with the porter, after coming up the escalator from the parking station. Was handled efficiently by staff, and had bags in my room in less than 15 minutes. Didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t use the porter on the way out, but they will bring your bags down to the garage and load your car for you. Check-In / Check-Out: As I was staying on the Club level, I was able to check-in and check-out directly at the Club on Level 5 (recommended). I was handled by the same agent both times, who was friendly, informative and proficient. Hotel Public Spaces: The lobby is very attractive and has a pleasant fragrance lingering \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I particularly like the little library space. There are plenty of little nooks in which to sit and relax. The Club: The Sofitel Club at the Wentworth is a very lush feeling space, available to all guests staying on a Club Level of the hotel as well as guests willing to pay for the privilege. It has a very elegant feeling, but is hardly stuffy as plenty of people were dressed in relaxed casual wear. It offers breakfast, afternoon tea, and evening canap\u00c3\u00a9s with a full drink service. Coffee, tea, soft drinks and mineral water available at all other times. Afternoon tea consisted of premium teas, barista coffees, and a small selection of finger food (both sweet and savoury). Evening canap\u00c3\u00a9s were somewhat unexciting (spring rolls, meat balls, etc) but a good range of standard spirits, Chandon or Deutz Sparkling, and James Boag beers made up for the food. Breakfast offered full continental and American breakfast options, with a small selection of pastries and tea and coffee. Service was average to good. The Room: In a word, almost excellent! The interior design is very pleasing \u00e2\u20ac\u201c you definitely get the feeling of quality. The bed is very comfortable, and despite it having a separate pillowtop (which normally I dislike) it didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t feel lumpy. The feather pillows were fantastically comfortable. The bathroom was stylish, and while the bath was only half-sized (hence, almost excellent), pluses where that a second set of Roger & Gallet toiletries were provided in the shower recess (a great idea) in addition to a full set on the marble benchtop. The only thing that was a little disappointing was the small LCD TV but it did include a reasonable range of Free To Air and Cable TV stations including Fox Sports 1-3, Sky News, National Geographic, Fox 8, Nickelodeon, and MTV. The room was very clean, and in good condition. The room also offered a pillow menu, from which I chose a contour pillow from, that arrived in 10 mins and was excellent in quality. I would note that, even though I was on the top floor of the hotel, traffic noise was outside was audible in the morning. The level wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t over the top, but it was noticeable in a quiet room. Service: A very nice surprise was that the hotel sent me a complimentary bottle of Bancroft Bridge Cabernet Merlot (which was very good) as well as a bottle of still and sparkling mineral water \u00e2\u20ac\u201c despite this only being my first stay in two years. I am an A-Club Platinum member, so this may have been the reason, but this is not normally the recognition I receive when staying at other Sofitels so points to the Wentworth. Evening Turndown service left chocolates, and a bottle of Evian water (but does not appear to offer full room service as bathroom bin not emptied). As was registered on my profile, I correctly received a Financial Review in the morning along with an information copy of my bill. Gym: I used the E\u00e2\u20ac\u2122lixer Health Club, that guests of the Sofitel can use. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only a small gym, with a small range of fairly standard cardio and weights equipment to use. It does however offer private and instructor led classes in yoga and pilates, at an additional cost, for those interested. Restaurant: As we had been grazing on the evening canap\u00c3\u00a9s at the Club while sinking a few beers, we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t feel up to a full dinner, but we did stop at the Garden Court Restaurant for desserts and coffees. I had the raspberry souffl\u00c3\u00a9 with white chocolate sauce and my guest had the vanilla panna cotta \u00e2\u20ac\u201c both were excellent and the service was fine. The coffees were a little cool but otherwise all good \u00e2\u20ac\u201c cost $46. Mini-bar: Good selection, although prices fairly typical of hotels in CBD. Beer - $7-$9, Spirits $12, Half Bottle Wine $22, Half Bottle Moet $75, Water $5.50, Soft Drink $6, Juice $6.50, Snacks $5-$8. Tea and coffee provided on house, and Club Rooms offer Nespresso machines. Room Service Breakfast is available at $35 ($31 plus $4 tray charge) for Continental or $46 for Full. Summary: You pay for what you get, the Club rooms aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the cheapest (top three in terms of cost for Club rooms in CBD that day), but the Sofitel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Luxury Club Room and The Club are worth it. This hotel basically operates as two hotels almost \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the non-club rooms (judging from previous experience and other Tripadvisor rooms) target the lower end (price wise) of the five-star market, while the club rooms compete fairly well with the best club rooms in Sydney.

The Sofitel is close to Circular quay, there is a hill back up to hotel but you can get buses to Martin Place and then walk from there to the hotel, just a couple of minutes walk. It is also near the Wynyard area where there are lots of shops and a Cityrail station.", "Date": "December 31, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "australia", "Title": "\u201cA wonderful stay with excellent service and the best coffee in Sydney!\u201d", "Author": "eaj", "ReviewID": "UR51778725", "Content": "We stayed at the Sofitel Sydney Wentworth as part of an Expedia long weekend package.

We booked our 3 nights through Expedia in a Classic Room. We arrived at the hotel just after 11am and on pulling up at the entrance in our hired car a member of the concierge opened the car door and immediately said we would need to go to the back of the hotel to park and he would attend to the luggage. I approached the reception/check in area and all the comments you read about their lack of interest are well founded. The lady who checked me in behaved like a computer generated message rattling off all the terms and conditions of our stay....without so much as a welcome, a smile or any other human attribute. We went up to our room and if you think all the complaints on here about the size of the Classic rooms are untrue/unfounded....think again. I could not believe that a 5 star hotel would offer such small, depressingly furnished rooms. The bathroom seemed like it opened from a cupboard and I immediately went back to reception to find out how much it would cost to upgrade to the next category room. I was told it would be $40 per night to upgrade to a Superior room and asked if we could see one before accepting it. A member of the concierge team took us up to a room on the 14th floor which was much bigger than the classic room. The reviewer who stated that the furnishing of the rooms is typical Ikea - got it right. We decided to accept the upgrade and settled into our room. The Concierge staff were extremely helpful, and always friendly and polite. Later in the afternoon I thought I would go to the \"full gymnasium and health club\" ( as advertised on Expedia & Wotif.com, only to discover that the Health club does not exist. There is a gymnasium and a day spa for treatments but no sauna, spa/jacuzzi etc..........I cannot see how the hotel can advertise a Health Club when it has none of those facilities. Reception staff could not tell me what facilities were available and kept putting my call through to the day spa which never answered the phone. I asked to speak to the Manager on Duty, who I was told was out of the office, Although I left a message to be contacted just after 3pm, by the time we went out at 4.45pm no call back had happened. We returned to the hotel just before midnight and I telephoned guest services (reception) for a wake up call, at the same time I asked if the hotel provided newspapers each morning and the answer I got was \" that needs to be arranged at check in\" I told the person nothing had been mentioned at check in and could he arrange for us to get the Sydney Morning Herald. We got the newspaper the next morning but not the following day. What is puzzling is that in a number of responses the hotel has written here it is said that they are surprised at the inefficiency and unfriendly attitudes of reception staff - yet this continues to come up time and time again which shows that despite their comments, nothing is actually done about it. Room service was very speedy but although we ordered virtually the same thing every morning - there was no consistency in what was delivered. The 3rd day the pastry basket and coffees arrived with no plates, no jams/preserves, no sugar....when I called room service and told them , they were delivered within minutes. Housekeeping was good , although when we checked in there was a noticable difference in the towels on the rack - one was new and fluffy, the other much older and thinner. The bathroom amenities were good and replaced as needed. On the second day in the early evening when we were leaving the hotel I called guest services/reception and asked for the bathroom to be cleaned and although I was told this would be done - when we returned to the hotel later that night with family guests of course it was exactly as we had left it. We visited the lounge on the lobby level for coffee and cake the one night and the service initially was excellent and presentation of the order was outstanding - however when we had finished and wanted to get the bill......there was nobody in sight and had to go to the bar and ask them to find someone who could give us our bill. When we were checking out I found there were 4 charges for parking instead of 3 but the extra charge was credited when I queried this. The entrance to the hotel is very luxurious and when you read about the Awards the hotel has won you would think you're in for a really good experience - forget it; for the same money you can get much better service, more facilities and bigger accommodation!", "Date": "December 21, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne, Victoria, Australia", "Title": "\u201cWonderful\u201d", "Author": "Vanessa_S1977", "ReviewID": "UR51136135", "Content": "Recently stayed here 4-7 December for a long weekend to shop and catch up with friends.

The hotel's communal areas are plush. Lovely marble floors in the lobby with spacious, light and airy coridoors throughout, but the rooms themselves are, though trendy, a little on the unimaginative side. The furniture looks like it's straight out of Sweden - all flat pack kinda stuff. But the bed is comfy and the views from some of the rooms are pretty good. Breakfast in the hotel is superb if a little pricey, as are drinks in the lobby bar. There's another bar on the 4th floor though with outside areas and while also expensive, the atmosphere is nice. However, why anyone would stay in the hotel when they're so close to a massive selection of superb bars and restaurants is beyond me. Get out. Explore. The hotel is a 10 minutes (slow, relaxed) walk from Circular Quay and the Harbor Bridge and the SOH. This is also where ferries depart from linking downtown Sydney with Manly and the other beach-burbs of the city. The staff in this hotel can be hit or miss. VERY hit or miss. The bar staff tend to be outstanding but the reception staff can be rather surly and uninterested. The rooms are all well equipped with minibar, superb bathroom (with great toiletries - you can get a good few quid on eBay for them if you don't use them!), flat screen TV and comfortable bed. There's also a desk but it's small and quite uncomfortable to use. The window coverings are among the best I've ever found in a hotel. With a mesh blind and a black-out blind provided, these are both fitted to tracks along the side of the window so when the black-out is in use, it really does block every glimmer of sunshine to the room. Great if you're trying to get some sleep during the day. I've given the hotel a rating of four overall but to be honest, unless my company put me here when I visit Sydney, I'd never choose to stay at Sofitel.

The only good part was our courteous check-in and professional attitude of the front desk officer Daniel. The rest is laughable. The rooms are smaller than even rooms in Paris. We even has an upgrage superior room, not a classic room. I asked what was superior about it and they said it was bigger and I had a view over the courtyard. I would hate to think what a classic room looked like. The rooms were very dusty, the glass panels on the wall unit hadn't been dusted in years it seemed. The toilet roll holder was broken and the rolls had fallen off. the bin in the room was still full from the previous guest. But that was not the worst. We were here for one night whilst returning from LA and thought it would be nice to break up the trip home in Sydney. We took advatage of the Sofitel Sensations special which gave us a classic room, dinner for two and a bottle of wine, breakfast, pre-dinner drinks and canapes and free parking(which was not needed). Sounds good, I agree....BUT The dinner consisted of 2 courses and few options but on the menu you could UPGRADE to some other dishes. We wre not know this as our waiter did not point this out and when my partner askes what the soup of the day was she was glared upon and told that is not on the \"Sensation\" menu but was next to where we were reading. the waiter said that's optional but still refused to tell us what it was. as was if he thought we couldn't afford it. our table of four just laughed at his attitude and tried to enjoy the meal. The food was ok, nothing more, nothing less. The best part however was the pre-dinner snacks and drinks. When we arrived at Club Sofitel we were instructed that the drinks etc would be in a back room away from the main club area. I asked why as I always stay in a Club room at every Sofitel and that this looked like the main area. i was told that I couldn't stay here and have a drink as I was on the \"Sensations\" package. I found this insulting and my dinner party and I felt like homeless people being offered some refuge and meal when in fact we paid a fair price that they advertised. it was the biggest upsell I have ever seen a hotel in Australia attempt. I suggest they spend money on a complete overhaul including training for staff and become like the Sofitel in London and LA and charge more and gives those who frequent this chain the service and respect they pay for.

My room was a well furnished superior room. Which was up to usual Sofitel standard. Despite being a superior room it felt like what I would expect from a standard room at Sofitel. Never the less it was very clean and used high quality finishing's throughout, A solid five star. My only gripes about the room were that there was only one telephone in the room on the bedside table. However there were telephone jacks under the desk and above the toilet. Why there was no telephones connected to them , I do not know) But for a business hotel, I find it poor there was no phone at the desk. The two sets of blinds in the room were also shocking to operate, taking a long time to wind up and down. The room also features two oversized bookcase type units on each side of the windows about a meter thick (why these things have to be so big and cumbersome in the room is beyond me for such a small room, maybe there is something hidden behind them?)

The hotel needs to look at the technology at Sofitel Melbourne to automate the lights; blinds and television to give it that edge, maybe even put a tv in the bathroom!

It got to the point where our responses became rude back to the 'tall one' because she just didnt have any resemblance of customer care, maybe she just had a bad memory. Saying this, the rest of the staff were friendly and seemed equally intimidated by the 'tall one' and her sidekick. Also dont look at the state of the kitchen if you want to eat - Gordon Ramsey would have an expletive field day. The rooms are ok - once we got them - i had a lounge and a bedroom but seemed pretty pointless to me as id rather have 1 big room instead of 2 small dark rooms. However the beds are really very good and the bathroom is as you'd expect in a 4*. This is a hotel with a great location, nice furniture, and a nice facade - However it seemed to me that as soon as something wasn't as you or they had expected it then you better be ready for a fight or just disapointment. Id suggest just getting a Room and dont even bother with the breakfast unless you want to experiance the joys of dealing with the headgirls. Maybe i was just unlucky with who i spoke to but I think some of their staff need to seriously be retrained in customer care.", "Date": "May 17, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney, Australia", "Title": "\u201cGood CBD Value\u201d", "Author": "lien", "ReviewID": "UR29585762", "Content": "Booked thru the Wotif \"secret deal\" so was not expecting the best room in the house.

The bathroom was lovely and clean with all the usual complimentary goodies (shampoo, soap etc) which were replaced everyday and beautiful large clean, white, fluffy towels which were also replaced everyday. The Hotel is in a great position with an easy walk down to The Rocks and Circular Quay .There is a 24hr convenient store nearby which is handy and all of the fantastic Sydney shops and department stores also within walking distance or a $5.00 approx. cab fare.

There was only one armchair and nowhere to put your bag - a serious problem if you were staying more than a night or two. The bathroom was marbled and very elegant but you had to go through tiny closet-style doors to access it. Likewise there was a nice flat screen tv but it was on a stand in the corner - there was not enough room for it to be facing the bed. All that said, however, the Sofitel bed was really really lovely. We had a great night's sleep after the comedy show - it was comfortable, warm and there was plenty of space to stretch out. We had two huge fluffy goosedown pillows (and discovered a fifth in the closet) and the sheets were delightfully soft. The staff were also faultless - they were thoughtful and took care of taxis and luggage without having to be asked. We also had a good experience in the Aveda hair salon and spa in the hotel building, getting a haircut and a facial with a couple of complimentary five-minute head and neck massages.

Breakfast: The buffet includes all the usual cold treats, however the cooked breakfast was terrible \u00e2\u20ac\u201d overcooked bacon and the worst and saltiest scrambled eggs I've had in my life.

We went back to reception to discuss the matter, only to be told, all other rooms were full, hence we were on the smoking floor. The whole floor reeked! When it was time to go to bed, we were hit again by the smell, when we put our heads on the pillows (which by the way are gorgeous feather ones). There was simply no way either of us could sleep with these pillows. When I called reception to ask for new pillows, the person at the other end actually argues with me, that new pillows would not make a difference to the smell. It was only after some time, that he finally gave in and said they would send up new pillows. Definately not 5 star service in my books! Also the valet parking is not so valet. You are not able to leave your car at the reception, they ask you to drive it down to the carpark and then the parking attendants do the \"valet\" parking. You are then required to enter the hotel via the back entrance, up as escalator. The same thing on checkout, you carry your own bags out the back entrance, to the car park and wait for your car to arrive. For $30 a day, I expect valet parking if I have paid for it.

I like staying in sofitels when the budget allows, as the beds are generally great, the rooms well furnished and with quality bathroom products. This stay wasnt so good. Firstly - DONT take a \"city room\" view without ensuring it doesnt overlook the construction site across the road in Bligh St. I reckon there's at least 6 months work there, its a hole in the ground at present. The builders are not supposed to start jackhammering and drilling before 9am, and for the two nights I was there, it was more like 7.30am and 8am. The soundproofing in the windows is non-existent - they are not double glazed. I had to get up around 8am anyway but if you wanted to sleep in or work from your room - just forget it. Secondly - regular Sofitel customers will be familiar with the nice soft layer they put on top of the mattresses. Mine must have been put on the bed while still damp...when I got in at midnight from my first day, I lifted the duvet to be greeted with the stink of wet wool. Not impressed - had to get it changed the next day. Thirdly....you would think that having Platinum A-Club membership would result in an \"amenity\" , and upgrade (away from the noise!) or free internet or something....nothing on offer here (and yes my club number was on the booking). I didnt ask to be moved or upgraded, because I wasnt spending much time in my room, and I wasnt interested in packing and unpacking again just to make a point.

Unfortunately, in two nights, their best replacement for the feather mattress topper, pillows and duvet, was three tatty non-feather pillows and a couple of blankets which it took 30 minutes and two phones calls to get (one of which the chambermaid took away when she came, without replacing it with the requested non-feather duvet, leading to yet another later night phone call to get enough bedding to sleep in back). This is also the only hotel I've ever been in that considers one sanitary bag the appropriate number for each 24 hours (and the bathroom bin has no lid). The small amount of dirt was (hopefully) squashed and smeared insects both in the bathroom and on the blackout blind. The blackout blind was very effective. The hotel did not suffer from traffic noise, but if you are sensitive to noise, get a room away from the lifts, as you can hear other people talking as they go back to their rooms.

We had reserved a Club room and on arrival were upgraded to a Junior Suite (but in hindsight the Junior Suite was facing the rear and a construction site with noise so would have prefered the Club room). Check-in staff were very courteous and whisked us straight up to the Level 5 club where you have a seperate check-in. We got a quick tour around the sofitel club as well as afternoon teas, evening drinks and breakfasts are all included here. The room was excellent with two TVs, well appointed bathroom and all facilities you expect of a five star hotel. The bed and pillows were the highlight and easily the most comfortable we've ever experienced and 'triangle pillows' appeared in our room within minutes of the request. On the negative, there was a welcome note for another guest with a piece of old fruit on the desk that had not been removed. We loved the club experience as we spent most of our time at the hotel. The Lenotre afternoon teas were delicious and tempting and so petite that you didn't feel guilty indulging. We drank enough fine teas over the 4 day stay to sink a ship. The canapes and two hours free drinks that come with club access were another highlight and the canapes were of a very high standard and it's amazing how many glasses of champagne you can drink in two hours ! Staff in the club were exceptional and clearly of a standard not seen in Australia. Most were European, several French and we only noticed one Australian. Agree with other reviewers that paying the extra for club access is almost essential here as our review would be different if we had not. There is not much the hotel can do about the building site with construction noise (and we could have requested a move) but the noise is disconcerting and quite loud. Dinner at the Garden Court was incredible with a price to match but the standard of service and quality of food was extr emely high. My wife said she's never tasted oysters so good, We had an accor card so got half price food but even with that Dinner for two and a wine flight came to $140. Bottles of water were charged at $10 each The recent renovations are obvious and the public areas and rooms all look wonderful. If you want a view or a a swimming pool in your hotel then go elsewhere but if you want a high quality experience in the heart of the CBD this will do the job.

It was actually quite simple, just choose the strength of coffee you want, pop the pre packed capsule in and hey presto a true espresso in your room.

The hotel was completely renovated recently and the rooms (I stayed in a suite) are tastfully furnished although I am not a big fan of blond wood finishes. The fabrics and linens are excellent. The bathroom is a bit too small. The highlight of the hotel is Le Club lounge, which is available to guests at an extra cost. The finish and design of this lounge is absolutely beautiful. It is spacious and has a side array of snacks and drinks throughout the day, including champagne and fine wines. It has many different kinds of seating, so it was enjoyable at breakfast (with big flatscreens tuned to the local news and plenty of newspapers) and superb coffee. The staff is no doubt a notch above the rest of the hotel in this venue. I visited several othe hotels while I was in Sydney for various meetings and the selection is excellent. None of the other properties have this kind of experience, however. The reason why I rate this hotel only at 4 is because it had a poor selection of tv channels and $29/day internet. Do you believe that BBC and CNN are not available? I watched local news for a week and got international news off my blackberry and online. Of course, I paid the $29/day for the internet (on top of my $550 room rate), but I think this is a bit over the top.

Secondly, the Sofitel Lounge on the 5th floor is a welcome addition, adding a nice touch of class to the hotel. Thirdly, the breakfast/dining area has undergone a refurbishment - it has more of a cafe feel compared with before. Finally, there have been some small improvements to the rooms - nicer bedding (doona, pillows) and a new flat-screen television. All of these made for a better hotel experience, especially the bed. It really was a lovely bed to sleep in at night. Overall, I think for the price the Sofitel offers quite reasonable value. The hotel markets its \"French flavour\" in the staff and menu, but in my mind it is a token effort. There are some lingering issues at this hotel which give it t less than a 100% rating from me . Firstly, room service. Has the menu changed AT ALL in the past five years?! It is dull. Secondly, the carpets in the rooms I've stayed in during recent visits have been quite worn. Thirdly, the hotel appears to be battling some staff shortages, but I think this is a problem for the hospitality industry nationwide at the moment.

Throughout my stay (4 days) the staff were just amazing - they seemed so happy and pleased to be working there - what a credit to management - best overall service i have ever received.", "Date": "July 27, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cork, Ireland", "Title": "\u201cVery good, for a one stop trip to Sydney\u201d", "Author": "Niall", "ReviewID": "UR8086962", "Content": "Staff were brilliant at reception, arrvd at about 7a.m. from New Zealand, and the room was ready.

A stroll away from the Opera House and Circular Quay, a stones throw away from the shopping district. Right from the check in the staff could not have been more helpful and friendly. We were in room 1114 which was a junior suite. Given some of the slightly negatvice reviews here I was a little apprehensive as this was an important occasion for my wife and I. I shouldn't have worried! The lounge area was skinny but well appointed, furnishings were all of a very high quality. The bedroom was a good size with a very classy feel, features included; a beautiful timber wardrobe/entertainment unit, side tables with an ambient night light which was a thoughtful inclusion, last but not least the bed was one of the most comfortable we have slept in. The bathroom was very clean and well appointed with seperate shower and bath, nice marble finishes were all appreciated. Food in the restaurant was excellent and again the staff were professional and the service could not be faulted. There may be hotels in Sydney which have a better view of the Harbour etc, and there may be hotels which offer larger rooms, however for what the hotel offers, you would have to be really nit picking or have suffered an unfortunate experience to rate this hotel less than 5 out of 5.", "Date": "June 30, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ottawa, Canada", "Title": "\u201cRoom not up to snuff for Sofitel brand\u201d", "Author": "123456FLY", "ReviewID": "UR7673041", "Content": "Poorly designed room - virtually no storage space for your clothes. No chest of drawers or armoire. Limited closet space was taken up by the safety deposit box, ironing board and luggage rack. Two bathrobes took up further space, leaving only 3-4 hangers for your clothes, while the shelf above was too high to be used and, in any event, was filled with extra pillows and blankets. Minute corner shelves were filled with an iron and a shoe mitt. Every day I had to unpack my suitcase and repack everything in the AM, as there was nowhere else to put my clothes! Lots of wasted space in the room. Built-in bookshelves contained glass vases, which took up valuable space that could have been used for drawer space. Mirrors behind the shelves and on the wall facing the bed were disconcerting to look at. You felt as if you were sleeping in someone's living room, not a hotel room. Roll-up window blinds took forever to roll up or down - there were two layers, so it took twice as long. The TV was placed at a perpendicular angle on one of the bookshelves (on the side of the room), so you had to twist your neck to watch TV in the evening. Lots of sharp edges in the room, particularly the cabinets housing the barware and mini-fridge. Watch your elbows! Bathroom has lots of granite, but little counter space. Hand/face towels, glasses and hotel toiletries took up most of the limited counter space. Barely enough room to put down your toothbrush. Shower stall had two plastic soap holders - obviously dysfunctional, as a third metal shelf was added to hold the soap, shampoo, etc., but the metal shelf still jutted out at a downward angle, causing the shampoo to fall off - and you had to be careful not to scrape your elbow against the shelf. If you turned the shower head away from the shelf, you risked leaking water outside the shower stall. There is no ventilation in the bathroom, so if you wish to do hand laundry, it is pointless to hang it on the clothesline in the stall, as the door bumps into the clothesline if you leave it open, so you must close the door and shut off all air to the wet clothes. You could try leaving the glass shower door partially open, but you might accidentally walk into the door if you want to use the toilet in the middle of the night. The \"queen\" size bed is actually two twin beds joined together, so have fun sleeping in the middle of the crack. Also, the left side of the bed sagged terribly - too many heavy people have evidently left their mark on this bed. Finally, the hotel is located in the central business district, which is DEAD at night. Nowhere interesting to dine (except for the Bligh restaurant, which apparently belongs to the family that manages the Sofitel). Overall, this stay was a huge disappointment, and whoever designed the interiors fell far short of the goal of customer satisfaction. I will not stay here again.", "Date": "May 22, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne", "Title": "\u201cValue light\u201d", "Author": "GreatBloke", "ReviewID": "UR7492786", "Content": "I booked the top Accor hotel in Sydney for my mother visiting from England, to ensure we had a good time. So we were disappointed when the little things kept going wrong. The rooms were nice and comfortable, if a little cramped. And the views no longer exisit as the hotel has been completely dwarfed on all sides by office blocks, so close I could read posters on their office walls. Initially we were delivered to the wrong room, which was corrected within 20 minutes. The staff were very obliging and friendly. Room service was so asleep. Still jet lagged we ordered some missing spoons and some fresh milk about 5am, which never arrived even after a reminder an hour later. A later request met with an incredibly long wait, so we gave up trying anymore. Dinner in the hotel is restricted to the only (open style) restaurant, with prices to match the 5star impression, but the fare was quite good On check-out it took about 40 minutes to locate our car in the car park and bring it up, at a reasonably quiet time of the day.
