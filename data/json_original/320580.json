{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Great Hotel in a Unique Area We stayed here for three nights in April of this year, and had a very enjoyable experience. The hotel staff were friendly, accommodating, and understanding of our almost total lack of knowledge of Japanese. The rooms are small by Western standards, but are very clean, as is the rest of the hotel. As others have mentioned, the beds are sufficiently sized, and the rooms are air conditioned. We only ate in the hotel restaurant for breakfast, but it was excellent all three mornings (both the Japanese and Western breakfasts).In addition, the hotel is in a interesting and unique part of Tokyo, Asakusa, that has a lot of interesting sights, restaurants, and shopping -- it has an older and somewhat more subdued feel to it that is a nice contrast to ultra-modern areas such as Shinjuku or Roppongi. Also, it is conveniently located via the subway to Ueno, Akihabara, and the rest of Tokyo as well.I would definitely stay here again!", "Date": "Jun 15, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR615232018", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Journeyman97"}, {"Content": "Best Ever Value-For-Money Deal I was tavelling alone on this occasion on work and was apprehensive initially...but I am still amazed at the quality of service, cleanliness, the proximity to transport system to practicall every nook and corner of Tokyo that this location offers. Truly enjoyed my stay. Concerns...hmmmm. the restaurante out there serves continental breakfast but he size of their burgers or anything on the menu, are like anything else in Japan...small!

I stayed here for 5 nights. Typically small Japanese hotel room, but the price was good. I don't have any big complaints. Little complaints include noticing that the carpets in the halls could use a shampooing; there was only one pillow per bed; and only 12 channels on the tv. None of the channels were devoted to English programming, although there was sometimes English-language news, sports or movies showing.I never tried Jonathan's restaurant in the hotel. There was a Freshness Burger next door that I went to a few times. ROX department store nearby has a good little 24-hour grocery section in the basement that is relatively inexpensive, at least compared to other department store grocery prices. The actual area in front of the hotel looks pretty dead, but there's a big shopping arcade that starts next to ROX.I never heard any of the staff speak English, although that might be because I tried to speak to them in my schoolboy Japanese.If I'm the one paying, I'd stay here again.", "Date": "Mar 2, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR565498039", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "simba_8"}, {"Content": "Convenient Location I stayed at this hotel about a week in November 2007 (days were not consecutive).

The hotel has a simple cafe/rest. with a fairly western menu at reasonable prices. This is located on the 2nd floor and closes in the late evening. If you want a more Japanese experience take a 2 minute walk around the corner for a huge variety of local eating houses. Don't forget to try the Denky-Bran. The hotel rooms are small but comfortable with very good AC  TV channel choice. We shared the hotel with our group of 10 and all reports were positive. The hotel staff are typically polite and seem genuinely egar to help in every way. Free wireless Internet in the lobby makes life a little easier, as Internet cafes can sometimes be hard to find. The area around the hotel is part of the religious center and so late-night bars are not plentiful.Getting to  from the hotel is quite simple. Hop on the Ginza line and aim for the Tawaramachi stop. The hotel is literally 2mins from this stop. Convenient AM-PM convenience store and good Donut shop across the street.", "Date": "Sep 19, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR997698047", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "phil.galligan"}, {"Content": "Good value, great location Clean, small, quiet room. We were given a non-smoking room when we'd booked a smoking room but had jet lag so couldn't be bothered to complain - in future we always checked during check in! Within a day the air con had helped this although unfortunately we couldn't open the windows. The staff were friendly. There was an Internet PC in reception which was always free when we needed it.

It is located across the street to a stop on one of Tokyo's primary subway lines. The staff was very helpful and all spoke some English. The room was what you would expect from a business hotel in this price range. It was very comfortable and quiet. The area around the hotel was a great place to wander around and there are very interesting sites within blocks. There are a wide variety of restaurant options from McDonald's and Starbucks to wonderful local establishments. Free internet is available in the lobby and, even though there is only one computer, we never had to wait to use it.

Are you looking for a clean, well placed and cheap hotel in Tokyo? Don't find more.

The hotel is just 1 min. from the metro station.Is on walking distance of Senso-Ji shrine and Kitcheware town. And if you like walking a little, Ueno park and Akihabara is only on a short stroll.
