{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Perfect for a small budget We stayed here 12/26-12/30 with our 3 kids, ages 4, 8 and 12. This hotel is a good option if you're on a small budget and you're not looking for anything fancy, but want a nice and clean place to stay. It's very important to know that this hotel has a traditional section and a modern section. We asked to stay in the modern section. The traditional section is definitely cheaper, but I would not even consider staying there.Due to the size of our family we were considered as 3 adults and 2 kids, so we paid for a triple room, although it only had 2 double beds, but at least they did accept us all in one room, which is usually a big problem for us for being a family of five. We got a New Year's promotion which included third night free plus breakfast buffet for the 3 adults and 10% off kids meals for each night of our stay, except for the free night, so we ended up paying about $725 pesos per night with breakfast for the triple room. The regular rate (no package or promotion) for 2 adults in a 2 double bed room is $597 pesos, and you can still have 2 kids for free. So check the hotel's website under promotions because they usually have good deals.I thought the room was very small and a little dark, and did felt very crowded with 5 people in it. But it was very clean and that was really important. The room had 2 double beds, but only big enough for one adult and one kid on each bed. I found them very small for 2 adults on each bed. We had an inflatable sleeping bag for the little one.The bathroom was big enough, with a shower, but no bathtub, at least not in ours. We never had a problem with hot water or water pressure (and remember we were 5 people). They didn't have bathroom amenities, except for shampoo and soap. The towels were small and could've been better. We did had to ask for towels every night because there were only 2 or 3 towels left for us each morning.The breakfast buffet was better than average and was very convenient for our family for an early start of the day. They had wonderful fresh fruit, different kinds of cereals and juices, including fresh squeezed orange juice. They also had yogurth, pancakes, toast, pastries, milk, coffee, ham, sausage, beans, chilaquiles plus another 2-3 dishes that were different every day, including one with meat and one with eggs, plus you could order eggs or omeletts any way you wanted. The staff here is very helpful and courteous. The buffet was $85 pesos for the adults and $55 pesos for the kids. It was a great deal since we got it for free for 3 nights of our stay. There's also a restaurant called Vip's, which is a chain restaurant, just outside the hotel, which is another option for breakfast, lunch or dinner if you want something a little better. And there's also a supermarket called Bodega Aurrera almost infront of the hotel, so you can always get food, drinks, water, toiletries, even medicine here.The location is wonderful, since it's only 2 blocks from the intersection of Reforma and Insurgentes and there's a Turibus stop there, which was great. The neighborhood felt safe and we never had a problem. They have a parking garage which is free, in case you have a car. We had a car, which we used sometimes. We also used the Turibus and the taxi service which is just outside the hotel. These are safe tourist taxis. Ask for Andres if he is available. He is very helpful and courteous.Yes, I would stay here again without any doubt if money was an important issue, but I would definitely consider another hotel if I could manage to spend a little more. The Sevilla Palace, which is from the same group is quite nicer and just as well located.", "Date": "Dec 31, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR537770100", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "mxtravelingirl"}, {"Content": "Did the Trick, but No Frills or Charm The Hotel Sevilla is a no-frills hotel smack dab in the middle of it all in Mexico City. Be prepared to cross two very busy streets to get to nearly anywhere you need to go: Reforma  Insurgentes.The staff are pragmatic and pleasant. The restaurant is nothing to write home about, but will do the trick when you are hungry. They are willing to serve their coffee to-go, but don't be prepared to be wowed by it.The rooms are clean, but also stuffy and dark. Our room had a view of a claustrophobic courtyard, but some amount of light did manage to make its way into the room. The air conditioning wasn't particularly adjustable and we had two choices for sleeping: cold or stuffy. The beds are quite hard and not and comfortable as we would have liked after a long day of exploring a megalopolous. There is a nice table for map reading and other business that is located directly underneath the one decent light in the main sleeping area. There are several cable channels to choose from and the bathroom is decorated with lovely marble and there is ample hot water and good water pressure. They also provide 2 bottles of purified water per day.Finally, be certain you are not confusing the Hotel Sevilla with the Sevilla Place (also centrally located in D.F.). We came to the hotel expecting to find a pool on the rooftop and soon figured out that the pool we were hoping for was at the Sevilla Palace.", "Date": "Nov 1, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR635626021", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "kayannjanet"}, {"Content": "Great value This is a great hotel in a safe, centrally located area of Mexico City within walking distance of the Zocalo and Chapultepec The rooms are large, clean and well maintained and the staff was helpful and friendly.

June 20  21, 2006. The place is clean, the staff friendly and the restaurant fair. The only bad part for us was that my daugther got sick, the reception recomended a medical doctor who was a real quack! Unidad Medica Turistica y Familiar. That was a real scam! Do NOT go there under any circumstances!

The room was huge (two queen sized beds, a seating area w/ couch and chair, coffee table) and very comfortable. The best part was the service we received. The waiters in the small restaurant got to know us and even tried to anticipate our order. They prided themselves on meeting our every wish.
