My only complaint was that there wasn't much wardrobe space for both of us and I had to live out of my bag a bit. The bed, however, was the most comfortable I have slept in for a long time, the curtains kept the room dark and we slept really well till quite late! The S Bahn station is right outside, as is the tram line that goes to Alexanderplatz. If you are arriving from Schonefeld airport, you can walk from the airport to the train station then take the S Bahn line 9 which passes directly by the hotel - get your ticket from the machine in the station (which will have instructions in english), you will need Berlin ABC, and don't forget (as we did!) to validate your ticket in one of the little machines that prints the time and date. At Landsberger Allee walk to the far end of the exit and those steps will bring you out right by the hotel doorway! As other reviewers have said, it is in the east of Berlin and there is very little within walking distance but the trams and S Bahn run regularly - ask reception for help in which transport card/tickets to buy and also for maps.

The package offered room for 2 nights, breakfast both mornings, 3 course meal on one night along with a drink in the bar on the roof. Checkin was slightly disorganised, originally the receptionsist could not find the booking despite making it 6 months before but then luckily did. She then attempted to swipe my credit card for the room service and bar purchases and was unable to accept my Visa card? so I offered her another which she did manage to swipe. This however proved to have been a waste of time as every time we attempt to charge drinks to the room we were informed that reception had not swiped a card! The three course meal was a waste of time. The service was slow and the food average and there was not even a choice of what to eat, we were forced to eat the pre-assigned 3 dishes regardless whether we wanted them or not. There was again more confusion as reception had only given is one voucher between us rather than the two needed. The same also happened in the bar, which was spectacular. The room had a view of the car park and the mini-bar didn't work. The air-con was also playing up, and when I informed reception on check-out they told me I needed to close the window. Why would I open the window in November? The spa was excellent.

As others have stated, the hotel is a little way out of \"central\" Berlin, but this doesn't really matter once you get to grips with the S Bahn, U-Bahn, and tram systems. You're never going to walk around Berlin, so get a pass for public transport for the amount of time you're there and you'll hardly notice the 10 min tram ride to Alexanderplatz from the hotel. The rooms are fantastic, we like modern hotels so the room ticked all the boxes. Ours was on the 6th floor and a long way from the lift. If you are unsteady on your feet may be worth asking for a room close to the lifts. The breakfast selection was extensive and the breakfast area was pleasant. We had an evening meal included in our Groupon and this was served in the \"Choice\" restaurant. Ironically we didn't have a choice, it was a set menu, but we were happy with the menu overall. The waiter was attentive, but we were the only two people in the entire restaurant so there was no atmosphere. We asked for some tapwater to accompany the meal and we were told that they charged for this. If this was a restaurant, I'd be annoyed at paying for tap water, but given that this was a restaurant in a hotel that we were paying guests in, we were staggered! It's the same water that comes out of the tap in our room after all! After the waiter had served our desserts he said goodbye as he was heading to the skybar to work there for the rest of the evening. We were left on our own after this point. The Skybar has superb views, and decent (if pricey) cocktails. We ate out in Berlin for the rest of our stay, mainly as there were many restaurants that were better value and had more atmosphere. The one thing that took the gloss off our stay was the glaringly obvious fact that this is a conference hotel. There are huge meeting rooms, and we regularly passed meeting delegates on their breaks around the hotel. Not that this is a problem, but we did get the impression that the hotel's main business is its conferences and so that personal touch with private guests was a bit lacking. The empty restaurant may have been a seasonal thing, but it did seem like the hotel was running on a reduced number of staff, and so service wasn't what we expected. Aesthetically, the hotel is lovely, but we don't travel to sit in and admire our hotel rooms. Given this, and the fact the hotel is slightly out of the way we'd stay again if the price was right, but we won't be rushing back.", "Date": "January 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Glasgow, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cWish I never left but I will be back!\u201d", "Author": "juli-scot", "ReviewID": "UR122363482", "Content": "Check in was quick and efficient.

Our first trip to Berlin. Rooms are lovely, ultra modern stylish and immaculately clean.

Found all staff helpful, concierge very knowledgable and able to supply all tickets/directions etc. The candlelit Skybar is lovely for pre-dinner drinks and the sky cafe served great cakes and coffee. The hotel is not central and the surrounding area certainly not pretty (concrete jungle and busy main roads) but connections to Alexandar Platz very easy (tram stops right outside and is really frequent). The location is far enough out that we did want to find somewhere very local to eat near the hotel and could not find a nice restaurant. There are fast food outlets however, In the shopping mall opposite the hotel we found a small mexican cafe/come restaurant. We went there on a Saturday night and all tables were taken (we did go back on Monday and ate there) so book if you want to try it. However, the ownere recommended an Italian round the back which resembled a station cafe. Food in both venues was excellent and belied the informal style of the establishments. Also very reasonable. The hotel restaurant prices, outside of the offer, are very expensive. We arranged a pick up from the airport on arrival to Shonefeld airport (45 euros) which was good and reliable and the driver was an excellent guide so this was an enjoyable introduction. However, if you are on a tight budget, the train is direct, 30 minutes and the station (Lansberger Allee, stops right outside the hotel. Tickets are 3 euros each. For the more conservative travellers - advance warning that sauna/steam rooms are of the strip down to birthday suit style. Stepping out of the changing rooms without warning was an experience if you are not used to bathing in the buff. As for Berlin itself - it's very spread out and you need to be very mobile and fond of walking to get from one place of interest to others - never quite got our heads round where the 'place to be' was - most cities seem to have them. A two or three day ticket saves money on public transport (which is all very reliable) and gives discounts on Christmas markets were beautiful and plentiful in the different areas. Everything very expensive, we came home with few gifts as a result which was disappointing. On our last day we took the hop on hop off bus tour (20 euros) which stops right outside the hotel in the morning (9.40 am) - this was a great way to get around the city and see the main sights. If we had had another day, a two day tour, not much more money, would have ensured you saw most of the main attractions and the best shopping areas.

Total for 3 days and 2 nights were 150\u20ac. Room : Very modern, clean and spacious. We stayed at the 8th floor with the view of the SBahn and Strassebahn and only a few steps away from the lift. We were worried that it might be noisy as people will come in and out of the lift but we couldnt hear anything. Hence, we could get good sleep at night. Toilet : Awesome. They had saperate shower and bath tub. It was really clean and design was modern. But just one thing though, they said that every room has a bath robe but we didnt get any in our room. But it didnt really bother us that much. Amenities : The room provided us with kettle, snacks and drinks. Room slippers, comb and syampoo. Breakfast : I would rate buffet breakfast as 5 star! everything was simply delicious! Staff : They were just so-so. The ones that we encountered were not as friendly as others had reviewed them. Location : The location is abit out from other places of visit. But the SBahn and Strasse Bahn is right in front of the hotel entrance. So it was not really a problem. But we wanted to travel around town at 8am on Monday and had to go through the working crowd and it was quite an ugly experience. Try to avoid rush hour when you wanna travel around with SBahn. I would rate this hotel as 4/5.

The breakfast buffet is superb and if you can get a table by the window you can sit and watch the world go by.

We stayed here in October on a 4 night break booked through the AA. First off, it was easy from Schoenfeld airport to reach the hotel via the S-bahn to Landsberger Allee station, right outside. We got the 72 hour all-transport tickets at the airport, valid on S and U-Bahn, trams, buses with a book of discounts on various attractions. Despite arriving at 11am the receptionist was able to let us have a room straight away. Then up to the Sky Cafe for a coffee and a look-out over the city. Because we wanted to do and see a lot we spent a minimal amount of time in the hotel but were more than satisfied with it. Modern, clean, stylish bedrooms, well appointed bathroom. The buffet breakfast was really well done, catering for all tastes from fruit, cereals, hot and cold meats and fish, breads, croissants and pastries, juices, teas, coffees. A good start to each busy day. Night time eating options in the hotel were a bit limited; a very sparse a la carte menu in one restaurant and a bistro style in Oscars. We ate in the latter one night and had good but simple meals based around 'build your own' pasta dishes. Visited the Sky bar on one night, good view over the city but a bit lacking in atmosphere. Not surprisingly, almost everyone had one drink and moved on. The one downside to the hotel was its distance to the heart of the city. Located amongst some East Berlin apartment blocks, there should have been a tram outside but the line was closed for repairs for the whole five days. We disregarded the recommended option of walking to the next major intersection to pick up a tram (would have been drowned in the frequent showers) and found an alternative by going one stop on the S-Bahn and then a tram on a different line. Tram goes to Alexanderplatz, from there you have many choices of where to go and how to get there. We did the city bus tour to get our bearings before launching into museums, galleries, the Wall, Reichstag, shopping, river trip etc etc. All in all, we enjoyed the city and the hotel.", "Date": "October 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cclean, airy, modern, new fixtures, only a short tram ride to center of city\u201d", "Author": "toasty24", "ReviewID": "UR119760874", "Content": "I have been travelling all over Germany for over a week staying in various hotels in each city.

Even better than the Le Meridien hotel in Paris. The only negative to this near-5-star lodging is the location. Located on the outskirts of the city center, Alexanderplatz, you still need to take a 5-10 min tram ride, otherwise you're surrounded by.. not much. You have to get into Alexanderplatz to access the main trains and to get around the city to see all the sights. The days my boyfriend and i were there to explore Berlin , the tram was under construction (!) so we had to walk. As new yorkers, we are accustomed to walking and honestly it only took 15 minutes or so. Despite the location on the city fringe, the super clean room and amenities made up for it. In fact, we would stay there again, b/c the price is lower than what you'd pay for in the middle of the city, and you get more room for your money. If you care about staying in a nicer place, without spending too much money, and dont mind the short ride to the city, then this hotel is for you. The concierge, Michael, was undoubtedly one of the best hotel concierges we have encountered.

We had to choose the date and time of dinner straight away when checking in, and we were recommended to book our bikes also fast, because they are quite popular (especially when the weather is nice). Staying a lot in hotels of this chain, I expect a certain standard, and this hotel lived up to them. Rooms Nothing bad to say about the rooms, they are spacious, with a seating area (sofa, table, relax chair) in front of the bed. The beds are comfortable. There is a TV with DVD player, and you can plug in any USB into it to disk to watch pictures, movies or listen to your music. The bathroom is big, divided into different compartments: bath, shower, toilet. The shower and toilet are separated by glass doors, and the purpose for that is not really clear. It's not that convenient. The shower is a walk in shower. There is a mini walk-in dressing and a minibar. Tea or coffee are free. Breakfast The breakfast is plentiful, with a huge choice of cereal, yoghurt, bread, danish pastry, cheese, meat, fruit, eggs, juices,... The breakfast area is big, but so is the hotel so it might be very busy during morning rush hour. The staff has difficulties in serving everybody in due time, or to clean the tables afterwards straight away. Dinner As part of the voucher, we got dinner for two. A 3 course meal was served, with no choice. I'm not sure what happens if you don't like meat, maybe you get offered an alternative. The dishes were rather small, but everything tasted nice. Would not recommend to eat here if you have been walking all day and are very hungry. Eating a la carte might be a better choice. Hotel The hotel is big, and it might take some time to walk to the room. There is a nice skybar offering a splendid view over the city (but nothing special really). There is also a spa, but we did not visit it. The lobby is huge, and different companies advertise their activities (things to do in the city). The only downside of this hotel might be its location. It's about 4km from Alexander Platz (although when walking it doesn't seem to be that far). The tram to Alex stops right in front of the hotel however. It's easy and convenient to bicycle into the city as well. To take a taxi from the centre to the hotel at night will cost about 10-15 euro (the drive takes about 10min outside of rush hour).

However, if you don't mind the convenient tram ride (I mean convenient as in 10 steps from hotel's front door and 5 mins from Alexanderplatz), Andel's is great for its value. The Hotel lobby is spacious, bright and welcoming. The staff is generally friendly and the concierge is very helpful in getting tram and tour tickets. I was traveling with my husband and my brother's family of 5, 3 rooms in total. The rooms are clean, contemporary, airy, bright and spacious with extra tall ceiling. The bed was really comfortable and the bathroom is spacious and clean with adequate amenities. Breakfast buffet was included in the room rate and the buffet spread was pretty good. It got crowded though as it was the summer holiday season. The hotel has many dining options, from casual pizzas, pasta to more fancy dining. We had reservation for a 3-course meal at the Choice but unfortunately the restaurant was closed unexpectedly the evening of our reservation. The hotel did not notify us of the closure, we found out from this posting at the restaurant door of the change. It was very poorly indicated as to where to go if you have a reservation, we found out from the receptionist that we need o go to the restaurant where breakfast was served. We had prepaid for the 3 course meal which was at 34eur per person, instead we were served a 3-course buffet (choice of salmon or chicken) which only cost 21eur per person. We felt totally gypped but didn't feel like management would make the adjustment so we didn't even bother mentioning it. This was the only negative experience we had with the hotel; otherwise it's a good hotel for its value. The sky Bar on the top floor (14th floor, I think) was nice but very small so seating is very limited if you go there past 9pm. To be honest, as Berlin is rather flat we found the view nothing special. Two hours after we checked out, my nephew realized he left his ring in the room so we called the hotel and they were able to locate the ring and it was a happy ending. Andel's was a good choice for this family trip but it's not a hotel I would return again given there are so many other hotels in Berlin city center.

I know people will judge me for this but after a loooong day of sight-seeing and tourist-ing I love to come back to the hotel and sip some tea and watch some TV. Not speaking any German, I was thrilled to find TV shows and movie channels in English. 4.) The AC worked amazingly and the rooms were surprisingly quiet. All and all I have to say this hotel is rather decadent for the price you pay. Overall, I found what little interaction I had with the staff pleasant and efficient. I really don't have anything BAD to say, except that the location was not what I was expecting. I am someone who loves walking around and exploring neighborhoods and seeing what there is to see... However, there is absolutely NOTHING around this hotel that I could find that was worth looking at or even any places to shop within walking distance (not counting the BK across the street).

Great view from the windows in the sauna - better than looking at wooden walls. The hotel has a great little fitness centre with a terrace you can exercise on - I did my yoga there and loved it. Location wise some have criticised it. No reason to. If you are staying in West Berlin and wanted to see some of the major sites in East Berlin, such as Checkpoint Charlie, the Jewish Museum, it's actually nearer. Transport links are great and it's like being in the Circle Line on the Tube in London and having to travel into Oxford Circus.

You won't find the hustle and bustle of the centre and that is what makes this hotel so appealing.

The staff were extremely helpful, and they always seemed to have enough people at reception to avoid queues, even at busy times. The food was lovely. I was there for a conference, and all the conference arrangements worked flawlessly. But the one bad point was the room design. The bedrooms had been \"designed\", clearly with the intention that they should look impressive and trendy. That's all very well, but I would much prefer a bedroom that had been designed with the intention that someone might actually want to stay in it. The room was completely impractical. There were no drawers at all to put your clothes or anything else in, and only a fairly minimal amount of hanging space. Now, if perhaps you're only staying overnight or you just prefer to live out of your suitcase, that may not be a problem, in which case I would certainly recommend the hotel. However, I was there for a few days, and I prefer to unpack my kit when I arrive, which was simply not possible. So be aware of that if you're thinking of choosing this place. A couple of other minor niggles: the TV in the bedroom came on to a channel showing adverts for the hotel chain by default. Nothing wrong with that, of course, most hotels do that these days. What was different here, however, was that you then couldn't change channel until after it had played a complete loop of the advert. That was annoying, and I only watched TV a couple of times in my stay. If you like to watch TV several times during your stay, I imagine you'd end up throwing things at the TV before very long. Also the wireless internet access was a bit unreliable. Perhaps my bedroom was located particularly far from the nearest access point, but I found my connection dropped far more often than I would have liked.

We had a corner room on the 4th floor,which was huge with a good sized bathroom. The room was very modern and looked very boutique like. We loved it,especially the flat screen tv and king size bed!

Comparable (or more than comparable) to the mainstream 4* (business) hotels. The dinner in the 'a choice' restaurant was very nice as well, although a little posh and quite pricey. But I guess that's normal for a restaurant in this type of hotel. Customer friendliness: Very good. Hotel personnel is very correct and polite. They assist you when needed and take there time. Facilities: I didn't check a lot of these so I can only comment on the bikes we rented. This was a bit of a letdown because i didn't think the bikes were that well maintained. Maybe, being a mechanical engineer, I have high standards but since I had to fix 2 of the 4 rented bikes myself I think they should maintain their bikes better. Rooms: Very spacious and clean. Especially the bathroom is a positive surprise: large walk-in glass shower, large bath tub and toilet, all separated by glass. Very good looking! The beds were comfortable but the bed sheets were NOT: they are too small for a 1.85m person. If you want to tug in nicely, your feet won't be covered by the bed sheets.

First off all, perhaps this is not the kind of place to stay for more than a few days, it seems more geared towards business types though we did like the hotel overall.

The main things that bothered us about the hotel were 1) The rooms (although clean and nicely decorated) were small and there was hardly any wardrobe/drawer space - certainly not enough for 2 people for 5 days! 2) Bar staff in The Sky Bar were slow and not especially friendly - we didn't feel very welcome on the few occasions we went up there (the view however is great!) 3) The hotel does have a spa though we didn't use it, when we went to have a look around the lady was quite rude and seemed like she couldn't be bothered us showing us the facilities. 4) No wi-fi...unless you pay 30 euros to go into some 'lounge'.

The transfer from Tegel was amazingly simple and I was in the hotel 30 minutes after leaving the airport at a cost of \u20ac2.30! I was slightly dismayed that I had to wait for 1.5hrs until 4.00pm to get into my room but the wait was worth it. I had emailed in advance for a quiet room to be allocated and I was not disappointed. The room was on the top floor overlooking the courtyard. I didn't hear a sound on any of the four nights I was there! The room was spotless and the bed comfortable. Good sized flat screen TV, DVD player and well stocked mini bar.The only slight complaint I have is that storage space for clothing was limited. There were no drawers so I had to keep some clothing in my case. It would ceratinly have been a problem if two peopel had been staying in the room. Good job my wife was not with me in view of the amount of clothes she packs!!!! Breakfast was superb. An amazing selection. Probably one of the best breakfasts I have had in any hotel and I have stayed in quite a few over the years. I was a bit disappointed with the location of the hotel when I arrived but my concerns were groundless as it was not a problem at all. There is a tram stop right outside the hotel and it is only 10mins to Alexanderplatz. Tickets can be purchased from the very helpful concierge. There didn't seem to be any decent bars or restaurants around the hotel but there are plenty enough in the more central Berlin area. Internet access at the hotel was slightly confusing. When I arrived I was told that full access was \u20ac15.00 per day which I thought was very steep and much more than I have paid in any hotel. Given that many hotels and fast food outlets offer complimentary Wi Fi I am, indeed, surprised that any hotel should charge at all. I was then told that there was a \"limited\" service which I could use for one hour each day free. When I logged on for the first time I was, indeed, offered two choices. The next time I logged on I was, however, presented with a totally different screen which gave me a user name and password for unlimited free access. I checked with reception and was then told that Wi Fi was, in fact, free. Certainly a case of mixed messages. Would I use this hotel again? Most certainly!

The hotel restaurants aren't anything to write home about but Berlin is full of great restaurants so we mostly ate out. We did eat in the Sky Bar one evening which provided a fabulous view of the city. The burgers we ate were excellent and the staff were friendly and helpful. Two criticisms - although we had wifi in our room (as we were on floor 6 - the business floor) it was charged extra and the red wine in the mini bar was possibly the worst red wine I have ever tasted.

Overall it was not bad, but in some aspects the hotel furnishing and equipment seemed to be like they try to keep it very modern looking, more than really functional. So it was not what I actually prefer. The rooms are equipped with a/c but it is possible to turn it off. It is possible to partially open the window and to fully open it upon signing some paper in the reception. First I received a room overlooking a busy road and it was quite loud all the time, day and nite, especially that I like to keep my window open in the summer. So I asked to for change and my next room was overlooking the patio - it was absolutely quiet. The rooms are equipped with minibar/fridge and a large TV, but itself they are not too big. The kingsized bed was comfortable, but some rooms have twin beds. The breakfast was a large buffet, good food and a large selection. But the service was not so good and I often had to look for the cofee myself if I didn't want to wait for ages. I have mixed feelings about the reception - when I arrived and they were preparing my room, they offerd me a voucher for a drink in their sky bar - and it was nice, especially that I didn't have to wait for too long. On the other hand, I booked for a late checkout and first they assured me this was available, but on my last day they said they were fully booked and I had to check out at noon anyway.

The breakout rooms all offer natural daylight as well with views into the old Eastern Berlin. The Conference area is purpose build and a good fit for groups around 250 people. The Sky-Bar is an absolute highlight of the Hotel as it offers very nice Skyline views at night. Highly recommendable (even if only visiting for a drink instead of staying at the hotel). The rooms are good but some are not very spacious. It's smarter to pack light and bring a small suitcase. Breakfast and lunch buffets are large and plentyful. The location of the hotel is OK for a Conference Hotel as Alexanderplatz can be reached with public transport or taxi cabs within 10 minutes. The S-Bahn station unfortunately isn't very clean and doesn't give the best feeling (especially at night).

The only thing I would point out about the room was that the air-con only went down to 18 which was a little hot to sleep in but apart from that we both loved our room. I was a little worried about the location of this hotel as it seemed a little far out from the city centre on a map but the location is great.

Also we had read lots of positive reviews so we thought we'd give it a try. We arrived in an early flight, and even though in our reservation it was clarified to us that we would be given our rooms at 12.00-14.00 pm the staff was kind enough to give us both of our rooms at the time of our arrival (around 9 am). The lobby of the hotel is extremely spacious and furnished with modern comfy couches and tables. The ceiling was also quite modern and impressive. Generally it gave a nice first impression. We were escorted to our rooms by an extremely kind and polite young man who gave us all the necessary information about how the elevators,our rooms, the breakfast etc. The rooms were incredible as well. I can say that they looked exactly like the photographs in the site of the hotel. The beds were very comfy and they were both equipped with huge flat screen LG TVs. The bathroom had both a shower and a bath, it also had a feature which i loved, you could turn the TV volume up ,and listen to music while in the shower. The breakfast was also quite nice. It had everything from delicious bread, a large selection of fruit, cereal, eggs, bacon, lots of tea flavors as well as a nice decor . It was definitely excellent. Now, the only problems or negatives were its location and an unusual and unpleasant odour the lobby had every afternoon. The location is kind of remote, outside the center, so we had to buy a tram ticket everyday (14.90 euros since we were a group- this included everything from tram to s-bahn and u-bahn and buses). Luckily the hotel already had all of these in the lobby so we bought them from there. Now with the odour, it is kind of weird, but every afternoon when we came back from whenever we were, the lobby smelled really bad, and I don't know why. It was a bit like there was a sewage problem or something. However we didn't really mind about that since we didn't really spend time in the lobby. Also another problem was that the wireless fee was kind of expensive. It was 3 euro for each time you used it ,and for each additional hour it was also 3 euro. However, that problem was solved, since at the lobby there were 4 i-mac computers that you could use for free. Moreover, one night we decided to order room service , which was reasonably priced, but it wasn't that delicious to be honest. I didn't really like the food, nor the taste. However, the lady that served us was very helpful and polite, and again, the service was excellent. Another night, we decided to dine at the restaurant of the hotel on the 1st floor. The food was excellent, and honestly everything from taste to service and decoration were amazing. However, its prices were ridiculously expensive and we didn't even order full portions and we still paid 3 times the normal price we would pay at a normal restaurant. Generally, we really enjoyed our stay at andel's and we would strongly recommend it to anyone that wants the best \"value for money\" ,however, if you want to stay somewhere in the center, near shops and attractions, i wouldn't recommend this hotel. Generally an amazing choice.

We got the 5 day version which was 34.50 euros per person but very good value as it gives unlimited access to bus, tram, U-Bahn & train as far out of the city as Potsdam which is about a 45 minute train ride as well as discounts (up to 50%) on entry to a large number of tourist activities including museums, boat rides, bus tours etc. The hotel is well placed in terms of transport with a rail station & tram stop are right outside the hotel. Berlin doesn't exactly have \"a centre\" partly due to the previous east/.west split but we used the tram every day to get to Alexanderplatz which can be regarded as the centre of East Berlin & never had to wait more than 6 minutes for a tram. Berlin is a bustling interesting city. There is much to see & although there is a lot of re-building going on (presumably still the aftermath of the war) there is much to see of worth with interesting modern architecture cheek by jowl with grand older classic archicecture - eg Schloss Charlottenburg. I can thoroughly recommend this hotel. We stayed for 4 nights & consider 386 euros real value for money considering the facilities on offer. Prior to our visit I had read opinions that Berliners were rude. All I can say is, this didn't tally with our experience - everyone we came into contact with was very pleasant. I have no hesitation in recommending Berlin for a city break ;& I have absolutely no hesitation in recommending Andel's Hotel as a hotel. At this price & with these facilites, why would you want to stay anywhere else?", "Date": "December 12, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Netherlands", "Title": "\u201cModern, nice hotel but out of the center\u201d", "Author": "HotelfanNetherlands", "ReviewID": "UR50832324", "Content": "Definitely a 4 stars hotel with amazing rooms, very comfortable beds and nice bathrooms; spacious and clean.

This hotel is really out of the center. You have to take the S-Bahn every time you want to go somewhere and the Ring S-Bahn is not bringing you to the center directly. You need to change a couple of times. Nice for the first Advent was the fact that the S-Bahn ticket was valid as a day ticket, allowing us to go everywhere in the city. The bar at the last floor was OK, pricey,and nothing exceptional in terms of drinks. View was definitely something not to miss. Breakfast is really very good. I think away above average for my taste. My husband complained that there was not a cook to make his eggs as he wanted like in other Andels hotels. Coffee was not good either. A pitty given the good German coffee.

I am also a true vegetarian so company dinners are usually a dismal experience. I was therefore very pleasantly surprised to get such good veggie food in a German hotel. The conference buffet lunches were imaginatively varied and salad wasn't my only option. The Sp\u00e3tzle were particularly memorable. Jug coffeee had a nasty taste but very decent stuff could be had from bean to cup machines. Staff were everywhere but unobtrusive. Empty glasses and crockery disappeared as if by poltergeist. The final evening's dinner started with a diminutive green salad topped with an edible flower and wrapped in a large cucumber slice accompanied by some tiny smoked cheese cubes and a balsamic dressing. The main course was asparagus en croute with a delicate white sauce, a soft and tasty tomato quiche tartlet and some baby potatoes gently fried and halved. There were two other veggies on our table and we all agreed it was the best we had ever eaten at an event, The beef noisettes which our colleagues had were also all perfectly cooked, especially impressive considering the kitchen had to prepare and deliver it for 350 people. The rooms are very contemporary but the Austin Powers look didn't jar, Not a great deal of wardrobe space but you have a safe. Clothes irons had to be requested from reception but came promptly. The shower was good but a little lacking in flow, however these are all minor niggles. A particular delight was that the water from the bathroom sink tap was actually drinkable (I often wake up thirsty in the middle of the night and don't see why I should pay 5 euros to avoid dehydration) and the windows could be opened for non-conditioned air (unless your room is facing the busy main road).

We booked through an online booking service and were horrified to find that the rate we had paid was vastly in excess of that which the hotel itself would offer.

Many people have commented on the location, it is very central to Alexanderplatz which acts as the hub to all parts of Berlin. You can hop on the M5 Tram (Hackescher Markt) and get off at Alexanderplatz, this is perhaps 5 or 10 minutes, so it still is very central despite the comments of other people. I would recommend going on the M5 all the way to Hackescher Markt as there are some really great restaurants and bars located in this area. It takes approx. 15 minutes on the tram (they call it a Metro in Berlin). I really liked how the hotel (despite its large size) it still maintains the feel of a small boutique designer hotel. I was amazed in a 300-plus room hotel that the reception can remember you by name, and even remember you after 3 weeks which was the case with me. The design aesthetic of this hotel is second to one.
