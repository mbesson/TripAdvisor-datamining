{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Affordable, small but nice It is an affordable, small hotel in a zone with a lot of restaurants not far away from metro. The breakfast is very good and has varied food, even some cooked ones like sausages and baked eggs. The small room was very clean and quiet. The personal is friendly and helpful. I stayed for a long period there and it was a pleasant stay.", "Date": "Sep 17, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR788196700", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Aleris"}, {"Content": "Service with a smile I have just returned from a wonderful stay in Frankfurt and was very impressed with this very affordable hotel which is situated in a very pleasant area of Frankfurt - near the Leipzigerstrasse where there is any amount of restaurants, cafes and shops.What I appreciated most was the friendliness and warmth of the staff. I never had the impression that anything I asked was too much bother for them. They also spoke excellent English which is an issue which has been raised by other reviewers of hotels in Germany!The hotel room was very comfortable with everything you could really need in it - apart from a kettle and tea bags (but this is a very British thing to look for!). I was in a single room which was on the back of the hotel which meant it was quiet and avoided the strong sunlight which hits the front of the hotel during the day. I had a very comfortable queensize bed - which made it quite hard to get out of in the morning! There was good wardrobe space and a very good dresser/desk piece of furniture. I also appreciated the mini bar in the room.Breakfast in the morning was very good. No real surprises! Bread rolls, ham, cheese, toast, cornflakes, museli, boiled eggs, fruit, juice, tea, coffee and also some warm meat - sausages and so on. A very good way to start the day off! It certainly kept me going most of the day. I think you would be hard pleased not to find something here you liked!In the foyer there was a computer terminal with free internet acces - very useful for staying in touch with people at home. There were also WiFi connections (Though I'm not sure if they were in the bedrooms or not!).I would definately recommend this hotel to friends if they were going to be in Frankfurt for any time. It does become more expensive during fairs but this is to be expected.", "Date": "Jul 24, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR225714563", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "rayondesoleil1976"}, {"Content": "Good breakfast, good rest I was pleasantly surprised - looking for an affordable roof over my head the night before a conference. Arrived late, staff was there, awake and friendly. Room small but ok, very quiet - I had requested one and got a room on the top floor. Could sleep with the window open (no smell issues like other reviewer). Pleasantly surprised by the breakfast, which included some cooked items like scrambled eggs in addition to the usual spread.Would go there again.", "Date": "Jun 15, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR321958822", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "businessmom"}, {"Content": "Small and friendly Hotel Falk is ideally placed for visitors to the big trade fairs in Frankfurt who just need a roof over their heads for the night, as it's near that part of town, and not a long drive from the main train station or the airport. For a couple of days it's fine, but I would not recommend staying there if you need to be in Frankfurt for longer than that, as the location is not ideal. My room was small, the mattress a bit soft for me, the duvet was very light and the pillow was so lumpy it was hardly offering any neck support. Cleanliness was very good, and the staff were all very friendly and welcoming. However, my room was at the end of a long corridor, which made it feel a bit like a rat run, and it was quite small. The decor was fine, a bit dated but well kept. The room also started to smell of food very early in the morning when the kitchen starts preparing the breakfast, the smell was so strong it woke me up. Breakfast was plentiful. So this hotel ticks all the basic boxes - clean, friendly, accessible for business types - but if on a private trip I would not stay there again.", "Date": "Jun 11, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR350226116", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "indiannauk"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187337-d232635-r8736421-Hotel_Falk-Frankfurt_Hesse.html", "HotelID": "232635", "Price": "$334"}}
