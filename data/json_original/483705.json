We arrived at March 8 to 11 - 2008, my husband, two friends and I, and we had a very good time there. Every couple was assigned at the last minute to a 2 bedrooms suite (at the 3rd floor, with baggage and no elevator), which is very spacious and simple (all the walls are white and with few adornments) with living room and a small kitchen with antecomedor, frigobar and oven of microwave. The bath has good size, has 2 wash-basin (in and out). Also there is restaurant in the second floor, but we only pay for the room, without food, and we didn't know it. There's two bad things about this hotel: a) it's far away from the beach and from the 5th Avenue (about 3 or 4 blocks for any of them); b) as the transport station is at the far end of the 5th Avenue, you have to walk every day if you do not contract the trips to the parks, which include transportation from the hotel. If your plan includes take the beach sun, or pass the time at the restaurants or the disco, or visit Xcaret, Xel-ha or Tulum, you must be prepared for a long walk every day.", "Date": "May 16, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "oslo", "Title": "\u201cHorrible\u201d", "Author": "frankie1120", "ReviewID": "UR14924159", "Content": "Never in my life I see one hotel bad same that.I don`t understand people write good about this hotel!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!This is not clean hotel,I have to call for change dirty sheet,the bath is horrible,only good is position hotel.", "Date": "April 9, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Forli, Italy", "Title": "\u201cVery good!!!!!!!\u201d", "Author": "monica78", "ReviewID": "UR7231663", "Content": "The hotel was cheap,clean and near the 5th aveninda!

This hotel was adorable, yes the rooms were bare but they were clean and the hotel was safe. Cleaning staff brought fresh towels, soap and shampoo, daily - some mornings we even got small candies. The staff was wonderful, recommending places to eat and sights to see in the area. I would recommend skipping the hotel's breakfast in favor of any of the numerous local spots, especially as Playa del Carmen is at it's most peaceful (and in my opinion it's best) in the morning. You're a 3 minute walk from 5th Ave, 5 minutes from the beach, and 10 minutes (tops) from the beach club - all in all a great little hotel! And for 30 pesos you can buy a Mexican blanket to use as a towel at the beach or as Mexican Flare in your hotel room :)", "Date": "March 1, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cBe warned\u201d", "Author": "wetherjw", "ReviewID": "UR3169337", "Content": "The vagueness and lack of information in the previous review is misleading. My family stayed at the Carmen Inn for half our vacation over Christmas, and it was awful. If you have checked out this hotel's description on the net, let me set you straight. Our room was devoid of any mexican character, generally dirty,with a toilet that would not flush (even after several attempts by maintenance to repair) and had the smell of sewer gas continually coming from the shower. There are no functioning bars, the restaurant serves breakfast only (mainly continental although I saw some people getting eggs) and they seem to have an extreme shortage of towels. The pool is as pictured on the net although I saw hardly anyone use it. It was in the shade most the time. It took several days for us to arrange another room and as we were leaving the neighbors who had just finished complaining to there local travel rep in the hallway echoed our assessment with the mother yelling out from within the room that none of the toilets worked. This hotel is 2blks from av 5 and an additional 2 long blks to the beach. Once on the beach its another 1 1/2 blks to the the El tukan beach club where you can pay for a towel and chair. Just so you know a vast majority of hotels in Playa are on the beach or on Av 5.
