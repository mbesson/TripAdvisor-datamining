Disney was only 10 mins away and it is easy access off the I-4 Hwy. Find the back roads to avoid rush hour traffic on the I-4. The Reunion grounds are beautifully cared for, pools are super clean and it is very kid friendly. Our son is 7 and LOVES it there. There were mostly families when we were there; so lots of kids for our child to play with! The pools are not too deep. Lazy river is 3 feet deep all the way around.

The resort is immaculate and so was the condo and housekeeping comes everyday to ask if you need anything (sometimes at 9am which is a little early guys). It's a bummer that the water closes at 5pm.

We occupied a nice house with a two car garage that also had a one bedroom apartment on top. The house was terrific with a courtyard between the garage and the main house that had a pool/hot tub combination (we never used it, but it was a nice thing to have). The resort itself is large with three golf courses that were all good and challenging in their own way, the Nicklaus course being the newest and most challenging. The service for the place was generally excellent. We had too many people for the place we rented based on the number of beds available but we easily arranged for roll-aways (provided by a third party through the resort). Our refrigerator died a day after we arrived, but they brought us a small replacement to get us through the duration of our stay. Beyond that, the place was excellently furnished, clean and had plenty of amenities (flat screens in every bedroom and living space, washer dryer, etc.). There were also general pool/spa areas scattered around the complex that folks could use in addition to what was at our house, which was use by some of the folks in our group. The only downside to the resort was that it isn't close to any type of nightlife outside of Disney being 15 minutes away. There are other places to go out for a decent meal, but you have to travel at least 30 minutes (except for another resort down the road with limited options). The other quirk was at the clubhouse and maybe the rest of the resort dining areas (we didn't use them) where they only took credit cards or charges to the rooms (no cash). Not really a problem but seemed a bit odd. The service was great for golfers. They really manage the golf well, store your clubs and have them ready on the carts for you the next day, clean them etc. No tipping allowed (\"it's included, sir\"). All the other service staff were great as well. Everyone was pleasant and professional. I recommend it for a family or if you want a nice self-contained getaway.

However, this resort lived up to all of my expectations and even exceeded them! We stayed in a three bedroom villa in the Villas South. The villa was nicely decorated, spacious and within walking distance to the waterpark. We had everything we needed in the villa including a washer and dryer, dishwasher, wifi, refrigerator with water/ice dispenser and they even provided us with free extras such as laundry detergent. All of the staff at the resort were very friendly and helpful. There were no issues checking in or out. I was glad that we booked through the resort because it appeared that other people were having problems getting access to the waterpark when they had booked through the individual owner or management company instead of the resort. The waterpark area was really nice. It was beautiful and there were plenty of places to sit. The only issue that we had was the \"no outside food and beverage\" rule which is hard to follow when you have little kids. If they would have had some more healthy snacks for little kids (i.e. Goldfish), it would have been easier for us to stay there longer. Instead we ended up going back to the room for snacks. Last year we stayed at the Grand Floridian at Disney. I would have to say that this resort was much nicer - especially since we had so much more space. The drive to Disney isn't too bad either and if you factor in the cost savings, it's probably worth it to stay at Reunion instead. We will definitely be back!

Orlando traffic is brutal, double any estimate you get from Google Maps in high season (the I-4 between exits 64-74, and International Drive, are particularly bad). The 11the floor bar/restaurant is very nice, and affords a distant view of the Disney fireworks shows at 9pm and 10pm. The golf and tennis are extremely high quality, if pricey.

On our most recent trip we knew we would play golf and would want access to the waterpark so we booked direct. Simple, no hassel, top notch customer service. From the lifeguards, to the doormen, and the great day spa. Occasionally we have booked through a private homeowner. We made sure to view alot of pics, view the website of the home, and talk to the owner personally. This home had a private pool, and all the ammenities of home. Very clean, and we loved that we could BBQ.

The villa itself is nice and when considered in isolation more than meets the advertised specification of those anticipating a luxury villa vacation experience. This was exactly what my family was anticipating \u2026 and exactly what we did NOT get. The empty lot next door, referred to in other reviews on VRBO, is no longer empty as of 15th October 2011. During my vacation it was taken up by a team of 10-15 builders who proceeded to construct a villa for all the daylight hours of Tuesday through Saturday of our week long stay. The wall of the new villa next door was being built literally 6 yards from the edge of the poolside. As such, it was not possible to use the pool, or to sit or eat outside PERIOD. So why the poor rating? BECAUSE BOTH THE OWNER AND THE HANDLING AGENT IN FLORIDA KNEW ABOUT THE IMMINENT BUILDING WORK, well before my family\u2019s arrival. And did they call me or the booking agent in London \u2026 NO THEY DID NOT! They did nothing except take my full fee clearly worried that I would ask for an alternative or a refund prior to departure if I was in any way in the know about the construction. And since my return I have spent weeks swapping email, sending photographs, asking for an apology but to no avail. I have been consistently stonewalled \u2026. and now I have been left with little choice but to explore my legal options. The difficulty I am having is my family\u2019s trip of a lifetime was ruined by let\u2019s face it, the stereo-typical \u2018Holiday-from-Hell\u2019 scenario of builders next door. No remorse, and no comeback from the people I paid cash to for this experience, and no matter what comes back in reply to this review, if indeed they care, they cannot deny that they knew about the IMMINENT BUILDING WORK NEXT DOOR AND DID NOTHING and happily sat back, cash in bank, to leave my family\u2019s vacation to fall way short of expectation. So if this review is not sufficient for you to look elsewhere in Reunion, then I would be sure to ask for updated photos of the villa given the new building 6 yards away, before hitting the \u2018book it\u2019 button and subjecting your family to naive faith in human nature, sadly the way I subjected mine.

Here is a list of just some of the problems we encountered: 1) Lost use of 1 whole bed and bath (entire trip) because the air in the guest house was not working. We were told they finally got the air working on the 3rd day (unconfirmed as it got cooler outside), but due to the mold smell the bed/bath was unusable. Requests to change linens in guest house were ignored. 2) No workable keys till day 3. Yes, computer systems go down, but this was ridiculous. Even after the systems came back up, Security accused us of returning the wrong set of keys when we got locked out for the 4th time. Come to find out, the actual card reader on the front door was not working and had to be replaced. The attitude we got from Security because we kept repeatedly calling to get into the unit was laughable, as we were at zero fault and we were the ones being inconvenienced by having no keys. 3) Ice Maker broken/Refrigerator not cooling properly. This was found out after $400 of groceries was purchased. 4) Dishwasher broken. We found a screw that was preventing water from filling and had to fix ourselves. 5) Dirty floors and dingy carpet. Roaches on the floor with a 15 month old exploring is just gross. Even after demanding that the unit be cleaned, we could hardly tell a difference. When a unit remains uninhabited for long periods of time, thorough cleaning needs to be done, especially when such a premium is being charged. 6) No curtains in upstairs bathroom window. We were already short one bath, so having an open window from about 4.5 feet up facing the neighbors was not good. 7) Paid for pool heat. Called day before to ensure it was turned on. Pool heat broken and off when arrived. Pool not cleaned in who knows how long, green algae on all inner surfaces. Pool heat was fixed on day 3. When you rent a home with a pool, you expect to be able to use it. Now we were comp\u2019ed one night due to our issues. Good yes, but I would rather have had the extra space that we paid for. We also were offered to transfer to another smaller unit. Good yes, as it was cleaner (no way to know if everything would have been in working order) but after unpacking and buying groceries, moving to a new house at 10:00 pm the night before going to Disney just wasn't going to happen. We shouldn't have been expected to have less room just to have a well maintained unit. This is an awesome resort in terms of amenities. We had a great time golfing. We liked the overall feel, but our housing just wasn't up to par. This is our 5th Disney Rental (and not the last with a 15 month old), was the most costly, and yet these were the worst accommodations so far.

The only flaw in the room was the peeling wallpaper and dirty grount in the floor of the bathroom. The room had a large soaking tub and a completely kitchen with all the utensils and dishes you would need. The old tube TV's need to be replaced with flatscreens The waterpark is an excellent feature. We were there on a 78 degree Sunny Saturday afternoon and there was only about 30 people in the whole park. Drinks at poolside were tasty and reasonable. Later we went to the pool at the cove to soak in a spa. They only heat the water to the 85 degrees in the spas. Hello Wyndham, turn the temperature up! They had a dive in movie later at the pool on a big inflatable screen.. Only problem was you could not see the movie with all the pool deck lights on. There was also no one else watching. There should be more disclaimers regarding dress code. Tennis courts are Clay so they will not allow anytning but approved tennis shoes on court. Thank God I didn't reserve a time ($40.00 for an hour?) They will charge you a broken apt fee of $20.00 if you don't show up or have the wrong shoes. Tried to go to the taunted Eleven restaurant and pool bar on the top floor. Be aware the dress code suggests no blue jeans. Found taht out after gettting a dirty look from another couple in the elevator. Then found out it was closed due to Holiday party. Finally got billed $23.00 for Wyndham experience. This apparently covers wifi and use of the water park for 2. Pretty expensive considering most Wyndham guests probably have 4g phones and pads.

We are not golfers, but we enjoy walking and the complex, which is huge, was simply a joy to walk each day. The down side to our trip though was my wife tripped and fell on a sprinkler hear that was IMPROPERLY PLACED (about 1-2 inches from a corner in the sidewalk and about 3-4 inches above the ground). My wife, who has had double knee replacement, badly bruised her knees, shoulder and forehead as well as injured her risk. Security was called and a report was completed. The next day the sprinkler head was properly placed (several inches from the sidewalk and flush with the ground). This, in my opinion, is an acknowledgement that it was impropererly placed. I went by and explained what happened to the Wyndham agent/representative at Reunion and showed her photos to document the before and after photos of the sprinkler head. She assured me that she would speak to management and someone would contact me. No one has to date. As I said earlier, we are proud Wyndham owners, but this incident really left my wife and me extremely disappointed in the total disregard for the safety and well being of it's owners. It would have been nice for someone to call and ask how my wife was doing and if there was anything we needed. Instead we only gotten silence. My wife is battered, bruised, and sore, and hopefully will be o.k. But what if she had broken bones or been more seriously injured due to this misplaced sprinkler head?

I called and told them that this is not what I wanted and they stated that they would change me to the room I want for a fee. I was not going for that so they changed me for free.

We realized how close to the action (Disney) it is, yet it feels like a serene place far from the Mouse. It took 12 minutes to Downtown Disney. As you enter the resort you get a small idea of the size and scale of the resort - three professionally designed golf courses, multiple communities, and neighborhood pools/tennis courts/play grounds abound.

It's a no-tipping/no-cash resort, but expect 20% service charge added to anything you eat/buy in the resort.

We had a gorgeous view of a course and the neighborhood pool was serene and beautiful. Our two kids made friends with the other visitors, but for the most part we had the place to ourselves. In our pool there was a hot tub, kids playground, tennis courts, a basketball course, and a nice pool house with bathrooms, showers, etc... the only odd thing about the upscale pool area is that pool towels are not provided. The resort does make up for this by offering as many towels as you want from housekeeping - and delivered quickly - but I found this a little strange not to have them readily available poolside. Everything just felt luxe and cared for. In Florida we are used to seeing a lot of leaves/bugs in the water, but here the pools always seemed freshly skimmed and cleaned. Our suite was fantastic! We were in \"G 302\" and it was as nice as any Ritz or JW Marriott we've seen. It was, in fact, a Ginn property at one point and it shows! Quality craftsmanship and all the amenities of home. Our three bedroom suite had all en-suite rooms. The smallest room was large with a queen, the other room had 2 Queens and the master a King and a HUGE bathroom. There were 4 large flat screen TV's with 100's of channels in the suite. The decor and cleanliness were a step above the rest. We also had a stocked kitchen with SS appliances, W/D, and all the start up amenities you need (dish soap, Tide detergent, hygiene items). We spent two mornings at the water park. This place had slides, a huge climbing/sliding area for kids of all ages, very large lazy river, zero entry pool, and a fantastic kids staff. Felinda made sure our kids were happy and having a ball in all the little hourly activities they provide all weekend long. The cleanliness and well-kept comments extend to the water park and towels are provided here. The food ordered from the Drink Deck was surprisingly great! I would put this property quite a few steps above most places you can stay in the Orlando area.", "Date": "October 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Alabama", "Title": "\u201cHad a Great Trip\u201d", "Author": "taholman", "ReviewID": "UR117998339", "Content": "Sorority Reunion met there and had a great time!

We booked this resort through All Star Vacation Homes and stayed in a three bedroom, three bath condo unit. To familiarize yourself with this resort, please keep in mind that it is huge. Approximately 220 acres compiling a luxury hotel, villas, condo units and private homes. The hotel, some of the villas and some home are offered through Wyndam and can be booked on the website. In addition, there are several affiliated rental management groups which are considered to be preferred partners which you can also book through. We chose All Star Vacation Homes which is a preferred partner, thereby giving us the opportunity to partake in all activities and events located within the resort. Please note that if you book through an individual owner, you may not have access to all available activities, so be cognizant in your search. We had booked a three bedroom - 3 bath unit in the Sandy Ridge Drive area - Building A - ground floor. The unit was about 1900 square feet of space - plenty of room for all. It came equipped with all the necessities. Top notch appliances, refrigierator with ice/water, microwave, range with great oven, dishwasher and garbage disposal. All dishes, pots, cutlery and samll appliances with included as well. It did have a washer and dryer. However, the site advertised it as full size - this was a stackable unit - a little tricky to use as it was not a common named appliance. Not a deal breaker, but if you are traveling with a group and need to wash clothes - you will have to plan on smaller loads and more time being used. The dining area was well laid out with a table and six chairs - living area consisted of a sofa (queen sized sofa bed), loveseat and chair. A 52' plasma tv adorned the wall with bose speakers and a PS 3 ( games and movies are avaialble at Allstar Vacation Homes for no charge for use if you book with them). The unit also included a laptop computer for use with free wireless internet. We did have a couple of isues with the internet, but a representative was quick to come out and rectify same. The bedrooms were all very spacious with beautiful linens and black out drapes. The master had a king size bed with a 32' TV - ensuite bath with double vanity, walk in shower and garden tub. All towels were provided. The second bedroom consisted of a queen size bed, 32\" TV and ensuite bath with separate vanity area and tub/shower combo. The third bedroom included two double beds 32\" tv and bath with tub/shower combo. All rooms also had a dvd player. This unit was ground floor and just steps from one of the resorts 10 pools. This was great when traveling with older children. They could go for a quick dip and still be within your view from the nicely furnished, covered patio. The pool area was well kept and very quiet. Almost like having your own pool in your own back yard. The resort does have its own water park - we only got to use this on one occasion. However, it was a nice respite from the hustle and bustle of the parks etc. It included a beautiful zero entry pool which adjoined a lazy river area and water slide. There was also a separate water/splash area for the smaller ones with fountains and play area with smaller water slides. The park does have activities for the children at certain times, i.e. crafts and games. Extremely clean and well managed by life guards. You may purchase food and sncks within the park, but no outside food or beverages are allowed. The food and drinks were a bit pricey and could add up quickly with a family. We did drive around the resort a bit to look at some of the other properties. Again, this resort is huge and I would definately recommend a rental car if you consider staying here. It is approximately 10 minutes to the Animal Kingdom and 15 to other Disney Parks. It would be approximatley 25 minutes to Universal. The resort is located in a very quiet area, which was pleasant to come back to after a hectic day of being at the parks. There are some stores and restaurant located close to the reosrt area for any grocery items or goodies you may need. Overall, we were extremely pleased with out experience at Reunion Resort. I would definately recommend using All Star Vacation Homes for your rental as they were wonderful to work with, and they are a preferred partner for this resort.", "Date": "August 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Leeds, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cReally enjoyed our stay.\u201d", "Author": "Andrea W", "ReviewID": "UR117246618", "Content": "This was the second time we had stayed here and it was just as enjoyable as the first.

We didn't get around to eating in the on site restaurants, mainly because we had eaten out so much at Disney and Universal, but the previous visit we particularly enjoyed eating in Eleven. I particulary like this resort because I feel secure. Security checks incoming vehicles and also drives around patroling the area. Free wi fi in the house was a big plus, especially after an internet deprived stay at Disney, the boys were desperate to keep up with the cricket scores. We would have liked to make use of the golf and tennis, but it was just too hot for us Brits. I would like to return at a cooler time of year.

This was made through ---. My daughter is autistic and ultra sensitive to noise. Accordingly when we made the booking in March, we specifically asked if there was any building work in the immediate vicinity. We were told the house next door was nearly finished but would be definitely completed by the time we arrived. When we arrived at the house late in the evening (from the UK), the alarm bells started ringing when we saw a builders toilet outside of the front door. Needless to say, the house next door wasn't complete. Every day, with the exception of two Sunday's, there was a team of builders working from 8 in the morning - laying a drive, putting up a fence, putting up guttering, finishing the decking, gardening etc etc. Consequently we did not stay around the villa during the day. I would estimate that Muirfield Loop and Palmilla Court are no more than 40% complete so building work is likely to remain an issue for several years. Be wary of agents who claim that the noise doesn't travel - golf courses are not exactly known for their ability to absorb noise. This will mean that building work will be an issue for this section of Reunion for the foreseeable future. I would also note, the house we stayed in was within range of a tee-box and we retrieved four golf balls from the pool during our stay - a netting should be put up to prevent what could be a very nasty accident. To be fair, the house itself was stunning and could not be faulted - the photographs do it justice. That said, the primary focus of a Florida holiday is not the interior decor of a home. On the subject of Reunion, reading some of the comments about the Waterpark, I would note we never had any problems there. The layout is fantastic, the staff were great and most importantly it was well short of capacity when we visited. Reunion has the undoubted potential to be an awesome destination when it is finished, but there are several areas that are currently incredibly under-built.

I'd driven past the Reuinion many times in various Orlando stays. It sits on the highway about five or ten miles outside of the Disneyworld entrance.

Well-decorated, everything worked, flat screen TV, etc. And despite that the front desk said the entire resort was sold out, we hardly ever saw anyone else. The resort is minutes from a supermarket and maybe ten minutes to Disney parks (and 25 or so to Universal). Beyond the room, the waterpark was low key. Don't expect big thrills but on hot days, it was perfect for a cool-down. It has a small lazy river, a decent slide, a bar for adults, drinks and snacks for kids, daily activities and a cool misting gazebo area. The resort's main pool near the clubhouse was huge. It also had a nice outdoor bar (though it closed at 6 for some reason -- isn't that the time you start to drink?) and lots of room to sit and hang out. The clubhouse restaurant was also very good. And if you golf, there are three very different courses to play. We'll likely be back. It was one of the nicer villa resorts we've stayed at in Orlando and we've stayed at a bunch.

According to other reviews I've read that complained, most of the issues centered around not being familiar with how most timeshares operate (no daily maid service) and surprises to what they did and did not qualify for. Also, after speaking at length with a Wyndham representative on the property, it appears that this partnership is undergoing quite a bit of transition (Wyndham presently only owns about 40 units, with a plan for a total of approximately 200 by 2012) and when renting from private owners (maybe even through Wyndham reservations (not WVO members) perspective vacationers should be dutiful in asking questions about what to expect. Our group of six (three children ages 8-13) stayed in a three-bedroom corner unit in Cabana Court (BLDG B, #304) which is walking distance to the waterpark. The unit was very spacious and the large balcony had a great view. The unit had a washer/dryer unit that took some time to figure out, as did the dishwasher. Maintenance said they get the same calls most every time someone new checks in. This should be a clue to management that changes need to occur. Another seemingly bad business call is that there does not seem to be much rationale to the dining and recreation collaboration. Other reviewers have mentioned the early closing hour (6pm) at the waterpark, but additionally, the rooftop pool also closes at 6pm, at which time the restaurant opens. The other large pool at Eagle's Landing stays open until 11pm, but the bar/kitchen closes at 5pm. Therefore, it's pretty much impossible to eat/drink at the pool areas after 6pm. Even though we had our own kitchen facilities, we had guests over one night and would have liked to have some snacks/drinks while the kids played at the pool. I understand budget and staffing issues, but perhaps keeping just one bar/kitchen area open during evening hours would be worth trying out. There are several small pools around the property (kind of reminds you of a community pool), so there's plenty of opportunity and space for everyone to enjoy the water. Also in the Eagle's Landing section a pool table (in much need of repair), ping pong, computer room, and small game room.

There's even room service so no need to cook, but being able to make that necessary 1st cup of coffee in the morning and sitting by your own pool is priceless. The owner was very attentive and responded to our every request. His knowledge of the area and the tips he gave us was excellent and I have to say the Management company made us feel like VIP\"s.

I hoped that given over a year had passed since the transition from Ginn to Wyndham, there would of been some improvements. Not so, and its now becoming obvious how much Reunion Resort has been de-valued by some of the policies in place. In the past, each year, we have stayed as a small family on Reunion renting a villa privately though the owners. We have tried to rent through the \"program\" but the price is to high for any vacations over more than a couple of days. We used to stay for three weeks. We still had access to all facilities and certainly spent plenty of cash on resort! Villas were more expensive than other villas in the area - but you got what you paid for and the resort was always busy and vibrant. Last year, following changes to the allowed resort facilities, we were disappointed with the resort - it felt like a \"ghost town\"! Reunion lost out on our on cash as we couldn't spend it on golf or at the water-park. The Omni Resort welcomed our money! For this years trip, we went to stay at Disney Beach Resort for the first part of our holiday and only spent a week at Reunion Resort. I think that we have finally admitted defeat and won't be back to Reunion! Because the villa owners cannot privately rent their villas with access to facilities, they are having to drop their prices. This is great in one sense but has had the effect of de-valuing the estate. Holiday-makers on a tighter budget can now afford to stay there - but they cannot afford the rest of Reunion prices. They don't have the money to spend in the restaurant, bar or club house. They may get to use the waterpark for the 1 day pass allocated from the villa owner - but are they buying any drinks? And as for using the golf courses - forget that as the cost is extortionate unless you're on a \"stag weekend\" special and then you can roll around it drunk! Sorry for sounding bitter - but Reunion Management you have lost the plot! During our stay this year, there were very few guests, considering the size of the estate. Golf courses were desserted apart from one very, very loud and obnoxious all male group who created merry hell and could be heard everywhere on site. Is this the clientele Reunion has been reduced to? Soooo not attractive to families - who would spend longer on site, more money on site and wouldn't leave such an unholy mess for staff to cope with! Come on Reunion. Give me something to consider you for next year. I used to recommend you to all my friends considering a trip to Florida - now I would just be embarrassed if anyone took up my past recommendations! I understand the dilemma with villa owners undercutting \"program\" prices but there has to be a better compromise than the current situation. Its a ridiculous situation for a holidaymaker to be on site clutching cash in hand but not being able to spend it as they have no access to the facilities and staff are standing idle with no customers to serve!

When I questioned them about it, the first two managers I talked to agreed that the charges were odd, indicated I was not the first guest with this problem, and had to call their manager in. The third manager I spoke to was extremely rude and actually said that there had been a glitch in their accounting system and that the additional expense was to cover the $300 credit they gave me. [WTF!] I refused to pay any more for the nightly room rate than was originally quoted until speaking to someone in accounting. Since they were not available on the weekend, I paid the amount I agreed I owed and was expecting a call on Monday morning from their accounting department. They never called, and my credit card eventually showed two charges from the date of checkout - the one that I agreed to and one that was for the additional $300 that they charged the minute I walked out the door. I challenged the charge with my credit card company. The rude treatment by that third manager, their passage of an \"accounting glitch\" on to me, and their complete lack of integrity in trying to resolve the problem ruined an otherwise nice visit. I certainly would not recommend this resort to any of my friends or family. Overall, the condo was well-kept, the housekeeping services good, and the spa nice.

Between the 3 families we have 6 children (3 boys and 3 girls) ages ranging from 3 to 7. This year we chose Reunion Resort and overall we were very happy with the resort. The Positives: 1) The villas: We stayed in the South Villas. Each family had a 3 bedroom, 3 bath. More than enough room. If you really wanted to you could fit 2 families in there if you let some of the kids sleep on the sofa. Very clean and nicely decorated. The picures on the website are accurate. 4 plasma tvs and 3 dvd players. Very spacious bathrooms and the beds were very comfortable. Also the location of these villas is about a block walk to the water park so if you have kids, I highly recommend you stay in these south villas as they are the closest to the kids activities. 2) Water Park: It's awesome! The lazy river is huge and fun with waterfalls and caves. It is attached to a large lagoon pool with a slide and a zero depth entrance (nice for the little ones). There is also a waterpark playground that the kids loved. There were plenty of lounge chairs and you didnt have to fight to get one. 3) Kids activities: They have a kids club but we didnt register our kids because we wanted to spend the days with them ourselves. But whether your child is registered or not, all day long there are various activities for the kids. Some are free, some have a small fee. There were various contestes all day long - hot dog eating, hula hoop, water balloon, cannon ball, scavenger hunts, etc. (I dont know if they had these extra activities because it was Memorial Weekend or if they do them on a regular basis though.) All of these were free. Then they had arts activities for a small fee ranging from $3 to $15 - tie dye tshirts, painting piggy banks, etc. One night they did a \"dive in\" movie where they played a kids movie on the big screen poolside while you swam and the next night they had a luau with limbo contests. The Negatives: 1) Pool hours: The pools are only open a limited amount of time - 10am-6pm on weekends and I think they close at 5pm during the weekdays. Only one pool is open till 11 PM so you still have an evening/night swimming option but when your kids wake up at 6 am (even on vacation) and they want to keep swimming till it gets dark, the hours are kind of a damper. But at least there is the other pool you can go to if you still want some night swimming. 2) Lack of Towels: A few weeks before our trip, I called the resort and asked if we had to bring out own beach towels and they said no, they had towels at the pools for our use. This is inaccurate. The only pool that gives out towels is the water park. For any of the other 9 pools on premises you need to bring your own towels. When I complained, they said this new no towels policy started about a week before we arrived. They gave us extra bathroom towels so we could use them at the pool, so it wasnt the end of the world, but still... your are a resort with 10 pools, you really should give your guests pool towels at every pool. So my advice: BRING YOUR OWN TOWELS :) 2) Large property: The property is immense. Its so spread out that you need to either drive to the other pools or take the shuttle bus. It wasnt horrible, but in my opinion just a bit too spread out. If you are going with another family, make sure you stay on the same villas unless you just dont want to be near them at all and only want to see them at the pools. Neutral: No outside food or beverages at pools: This is a negative at any resort when you have small kids as they can be very picky about what they eat and you dont want to pay resort prices for food for them when you arent sure if they are going to eat it in the end...However, I will say that they were not strict at all in enforceing this rule. We brought the kids snacks, juice boxes, fruit and sandwiches every day and not one resort person stopped us or said anything. Also, when we did order food/drinks for the adults, the food was very good and the prices resonable for a resort.

First floor because of having two small children with us. Wanted to be close to the water park. It wasn't all that close, but within walking distance. Except for dropping off, parking is away from the water park facility. The three bedroom villa was clean and roomy. Easy drive to the Disney parks. Did not play any golf, but we were right on a course. Should have brought a couple of sticks just to practice a bit. To the person, everyone is nice, helpful and friendly. A small shopping center with a Publix is just outside one of the gates. Here are some of my observations for you to consider: 1. We were there the first week in May. The swimming pool for the six or so buildings in our complex is somewhat small. Not a concern for us, but could be during high occupancy periods. 2. Appliances are \"low end\". Not a problem for a short stay, but the oven did not work the first day, the dishwasher when running sounds like a freight train coming through the unit & the apartment size washer & drier were really noisy and were 'marginally' effective. Not a big deal, but caught my attention. 3. The furnishings were not what I expected. Not a light, airy, vacation type look one might expect. Very heavy, dark appearance throughout in the entire villa. Not a big deal, but, again, caught me off guard. 4. Wall mounted flat screen TV in each bedroom. Nice touch, but the living room TV was hooked up to a Bose sound system that no one, I found, could explain how to operate all the features (at least in English) The only explanation I received on how to adjust the volume was to \"push the button\" on the TV set. It might have helped if I spoke Spanish, but I don't think it would have made any difference. Written directions would have been a plus. 5. There was no trash room, dumpster, bin, whatever at the villa. The explanation was to just leave your trash outside & someone \"will get to it\". That works, but if you leave it out in the evening that 'someone' is a raccoon. A design flaw. 6. 24 hour security, but if you look 'normal' you get a wave through. Worked for me, but just be advised it is more a privacy gate than security. 7. The water park is great for the kids. However, it opens 9:00 AM and closes at 5:00PM on weekdays (10-6 Friday & Saturday). If you are on a Disney intensive vacation, plan on giving up park time to use it. It is a lot smaller than you would think by looking at the pictures. During high occupancy periods it would be standing room only. 8. Had dinner one night at the 'eleven' restaurant one night. OK, but really pricey. Full meal with wine & drinks with the ++ and 20% tip charge, can easilly put it in the $400 range for 5-6 people. Not worth it. Service is friendly, but not as attentive as one might expect. Let's face it, if the tip is a 'given' there is no reason to try to 'suck up for the extra buck'. 9.Van transportation is provided throughout the complex. However, I wish they had a Disney shuttle available. Even at an additional cost. 10. We stayed there for $199.00 ++ a night, which came out to be about $250.00. It was an \"internet special\" price. I think that is at the absolute top price range for where we stayed! 11. The pictures on line accurately portray the resort, but it is really spread out with a lot of empty space. It doesn't have that 'resort' feel to it. More like a condo or apartment complex. 12. Would I recommend staying there. Yes, but not unless it was priced down to at least what I paid.

The layout of our villa at Reunion was not as family friendly with the bedroom with the twin beds near the front with a very bright outside light shining all night long into room. If you want a sleeper sofa make sure to ask for villa with one because ours did not have one. The other bedroom was a double and we thought it was going to be a queen. We made do but the Omni reservations make it easier to make sure you are getting what you want. The Reunion resort is huge and I am sure if we needed to we could have moved to villa with another set up but we did not. Activities: Waterpark is awesome. The area is far from most villas but they have a shuttle and parking if you choose to drive. They have a zero entry area for young ones and great lazy river with slide (42\"and up).

The building where we checked in was elegant and modern. I was excited to check- in and see our condo as I was impressed with the initial building. i was quite disappointed when we checked into our condo because it looked like any average condo we have rented before in Orlando. In fact, the other condos were better (I.e., Sheraton Vistana Village, Summer Bay etc). I was more disappointed because we spent 3Xs as much on the Reunion Resort as any other condo in Orlando. I wanted to try it since it got great reviews. So, it was an average-looking condo. The next issue is that we booked a 2-bedroom for my husband and I and our 3 young children. Instead they gave us the very average looking 3-bedroom 2-level condo. I'm not sure why because the resort did not appear to be busy. The kicker was that they wanted us to lock one of the bedrooms so we could only use the 2 bedrooms we paid for or charge us extra $$$. Well, it was ridiculous because 2 bedrooms were upstairs and one was downstairs. If we locked the main floor bedroom, we would be shut off from the main bathroom (which had the only bathtub for our children to bathe in) and it also had the only safe to store our valuables in the whole condo. Further, we prefer to always sleep on the same level as our 3 young children. Also, I have never rented a 2-bedroom condo in orelando with the use of only 1 full bath- AND this resort was more expensive than the rest. If I knew they were going to force this awkward set-up on us, I definitely would have booked another resort that also had wonderful reviews. Finally, our plane doesn't leave until the early evening and we needed a late checkout. Usually at nicer resorts, they are pretty accommodating about late check-outs--as long as there are not other guests trying to check-in- especially with the higher price that we paid for the resort. I asked the resort for a late checkout and they asked for $50 ( while the resort is nowhere capacity). Very disappointed in these tactics at trying to get extra money out of their guests. Although their waterpark and golf courses were nice, I would never stay at this resort again.

I would just like to be able to pay a flat fee (not $60 a day, mind you) to be able to use this during our entire stay. Try explaining to your autistic son that we are not able to go to that pool when he sees all the cool and fun things to do there. They have plenty of other pools, but if you have 7 & 8 year olds they want water slides and lazy rivers! My husband golfed here on our stay two summers ago and thoroughly enjoyed it. They also have a spa, which I have not been able to use. We love that we feel away from it all, yet have a short drive to the theme parks. I would recommend a stay here, but be aware of the water park issue (if it applies to you) before booking.", "Date": "March 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "mexico city", "Title": "\u201cvery good choise\u201d", "Author": "surymetro", "ReviewID": "UR101325355", "Content": "we came back for a vacation trip whit our young kids , and we very happy about the grat condo we get very clean and brand new furniture . we very recomeded as a choise to go in orlando", "Date": "March 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Edmonton, Canada", "Title": "\u201cA happy wife is a happy life.

The water park also has limited hours 10 am to 5 pm. I can't imagine why it doesn't stay open later. They rent bikes but there are no bike paths. You have to ride on the road.

We were staying a week and planned to do several days at the Disney parks, but knew with a 1 yr-old and 3 yr-old we would have cranky children who would not be able to tolerate all meals on the road. Reunion Resort was wonderful at check-in, very professional and friendly...the lobby is beautiful and the grounds are meticulously maintained. My father-in-law played golf on 3 courses and said they were unbelievably fantastic. We stayed in the Centre Court Ridge area of the resort, in a 2-BR villa. It was beautiful, spotless, and had every amenity you needed. Daily housekeeping was impeccable, beds were made, towels refreshed, and everything cleaned. We had a huge balcony with views of the golf course. Flat screen TVs, dvd players, ipod docks...and all stainless appliances. We had a washer/dryer, too, which we made use of---it was great not to have to pack several changes of clothes per day. The resort provided safety rails for the beds, and also a pack and play for my 1 yr old. Our complex had its own private pool, but we chose to use the property's water park which had huge heated zero-entry pools for the kids, a huge play area, and a lazy river. It also featured crafts and activities for young kids and teens, and had poolside bar and food service. IT WAS WONDERFUL!! You had to drive to this area, but that did not bother us. It was a 10 minute drive to Magic Kingdom, a little less to Hollywood Studios...and minutes from dining and other attractions. There was a PUBLIX grocery store less than 3 minutes from the resort, and a CVS with a Minute Clinic. (Dunkin Donuts too, for all you coffee lovers!) We ate breakfast in our room, and kept plenty of snacks on hand to bring to the parks. We often ordered dinner \"to go\" from area restaurants, and brought it back to our room so the kids could watch a DVD while we ate dinner. All in all, the hotel gets an A+ for service, quality, value and luxury. They really did it right. This is the way to do Disney...why bother renting a tiny room with 2 beds from Disney when you can get your own living space with full kitchen, dining room, large soaking tubs and separate bedrooms!!

The resort is large and beautiful, the staff are very friendly & efficient, and our 3-bedroom condo was spacious and very comfortable. We booked through Travelocity, and the resort initially had us in a less-desirable unit, but we were able to move to a better location without a problem. We had full use of the resort's pools, great golf courses and tennis. Our kids loved the resort's private water park and spent many hours there over several days; they also enjoyed several of the resort's 10 pools. Dinner at the resort's \"Eleven\" restaurant was excellent; we also dined at their \"Clubhouse,\" where the food quality was uneven -- plus we waited 35 minutes to be seated, although the restaurant never became more than half full; management's excuses for the wait were unsatisfactory. The resort is a large, gated community, which helped us feel more secure. We never used the resort's free shuttle service, opting to drive from our condo to the other on-site pools, golf, water park, etc. Free parking was plentiful wherever we went. The resort is huge, but easily navigated by car. Here are our overall impressions: PROS -- Beautiful, lush landscaping, expertly maintained -- Large condo unit; quality beds, linen (we stayed in Heritage Crossing) -- Daily maid service; (occasionally forgot to supply soap bars or coffee; no big deal) -- Fantastic private water park for the kids; efficient poolside service for drinks/lunch -- Large (75-foot?) pool & hot tub steps from our condo unit; we had it to ourselves, most of the time -- Professional and very helpful, friendly staff; everyone we dealt with on the phone or in person was great, without exception! -- A large grocery store & pharmacy were literally across the street; super convenient! -- Our son had a minor medical problem, and the resort recommended a Medical Clinic that was only 5 minutes away; excellent Doctor and staff CONS -- A bit farther from the Disney parks & Downtown Disney than we would have liked; distance is only 8-9 miles, but tourist traffic often led to congestion and longer drives than we wanted; however, we learned to time our trips to avoid most of the tie-ups -- Only two on-site restaurants, and very limited dining choices nearby; other than a Chili's about 3 miles away, there were only fast-food places, which we avoided completely -- (sort of a 'CON') Reunion adds 18% gratuity to all on-site services, including food/beverages; that, plus the local taxes made things a bit pricey; we knew this before we arrived, but it was still startling to pay $85 for a relatively simple, poolside lunch (including 2 Gin & Tonics) at the water park. The resort is very upmarket, but be prepared to pay for it!! We don't regret the cost, at all. The staff were so good, we would have tipped them 18% anyway, and often topped up to show our gratitude for their superb service. -- The central air-conditioning unit in our condo was quite noisy, but did keep us comfortably cool in the hot, humid August Orlando climate. -- There was no Wi-Fi Internet coverage in our condo complex, but there were high-speed ports throughout the unit, and the Internet speed was quite good; I would have preferred Wi-Fi, but it wasn't a deal breaker With the provisos mentioned above, we'd certainly recommend this resort to others and will likely return one day.", "Date": "August 12, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Antonio, Texas", "Title": "\u201cGreat Stay- Rented a Home, However ...\u201d", "Author": "Southton", "ReviewID": "UR74365789", "Content": "We just got back from a 4 day stay at the Reunion Resort. We decided to splurge a little and rent a four bedroom home with a private backyard pool and a lovely view of the golf course. Overall, our stay was fabulous because it was problem free. However, do check on your reservation before you go. I called the resort directly. We originally reserved one home then decided to upgrade to another. No problem- we were able to get the home we wanted with all of its added amenities. The resort is good about sending email confirmations, but as our trip drew closer I noticed that none of them stated the property number we were staying in. I wanted to confirm that we had the upgraded house that we had already paid for in advance. When I called reservations, I was surprised to learn that we had been moved to a comparable sized home, but not with the special amenities like the home that convinced us to upgrade. The reservations folks did apologize, promised to look into the matter and get back to me shortly. They called me back promptly (I was expecting the worse that we would have to settle), but they were able to put us back in the right home. I still don't know what exactly happened. Perhaps we got bumped for another guest who was staying longer. The rest of our stay went without a problem. We were cheerfully greeted at check-in. More importantly, the home exceeded our expectations. I was fearful that the pictures were too good to be true and the property would be tired and worn. That was not the case. The home was immaculate. It was very clean and housekeeping came daily. Our backyard pool was not screened, because of the golf course view, so we had little bugs and leaves in the pool. That's understandable, so I called to have it cleaned and they were very responsive each time. No complaints on service. Also, our home had free wifi service. The grounds all over the resort are very well kept. The water park was also fun, ... however the pool hours are short. The shuttle is very convenient and will pick you up and take anywhere on the resort property. The resort is very convenient to the Disney Parks. By the way- you can see the Magic Kingdom fireworks show every night from the 11th floor outdoor pool/bar/restaurant. There is also a Publix grocery store and a few fast food joints just outside the resort boundary. So, if you have a rental car, you don't have to go very far. Overall, our experience was great. I would stay there again. It can be pricey, but for a short stay and especially one you don't mind splurging a little, it's a great experience. I would have given them a 5 star rating, but the whole switcheroo thing made me a bit salty, even though they did make good on it, but only because I called and confirmed in advance.

We have chosen to rent from private owners and have struck up good friendships with the owners we have rented from the last three years. They signed us as guests and we could take advantage of the wonderful facilities - paying for the privilege of course! We're from the UK and each year, we check direct with Reunion Resort for a price for our holiday - usually a three week period. Each year, we suck in our breath with the figures which are quoted as they are highly overpriced. It always appears as if the Resort is more geared towards short-term stays of less than a week. In those cases, the luxury price would probably be OK but the rate becomes totally unreasonable once you start looking for a stay of two or more weeks. This is one of the reasons we chose private rental - also we get to exactly chose the villa which suites our needs. In past years, we have spent huge sums of money on resort - making use of golf, waterpark and the restaurants. We are probably the exact kind of customers Reunion should want to encourage. This year, we were denied access to golf and the waterpark as the villa owners now only have a limited number of passes to give away to their guests. Needless to say, we spent very little on resort and felt annoyed to see most of the facilties barely used! This new policy appears to have come about as a way for Wyndham to restrict villa owners from renting privately and to force the owners to put their villas in the \"Reunion Rental Program\". Perhaps if the program offered more realistic prices to guests, then more guests would rent through the program! Come on Wyndham - sort yourselves out! It can't be good business sense to deny potential customers access to facilities? Surely there is a happy medium?

I was pleased to learn that this is now a Wyndham property too. My son loved the water park and we liked the quiet surroundings. The service at the hotel needs polishing. This started with making reservations. Reservations was not doing what most reservation agents do, which is d their best to help the guest with the best options. Instead, after being quoted a price I asked about FL discount, then I asked about a possible weekend discount. As I was booking the reservation I looked at the website. \"$100 off the second night\". I inquired about this and saved an additional $60, but I felt as though the agent did not want to give me this discount. Odd, but I suppose not unusual. There is an automatic 20% gratuity on everything. Even when the service is lacking or when they make mistakes in your order and do not do much to rectify their mistakes. This did not \"rub\" me the right way. I would have expected better service from in this setting. We were checking out on Monday, but on Sunday housekeeping did not clean our Villa (D-102). They saw us leave at 10am to go to the water park, but when we returned at 5pm it was never cleaned. When I called the front desk they said they would check into it and someone would call us. 15min later I called again and the front desk was surprised to learn that no one called us yet. UGH! I asked to speak to the Manager on Duty. I got the housekeeping supervisor. I asked if she was the MOD and she was not. Then I spoke to the MOD, who was supposedly the Director of Housekeeping. I told her the entire story and she answers me by telling me that there is AM MOD and not the PM MOD, but she would help me. The fist thing she did was apologize. The second thing she did was put me on hold. Five minutes later, she told me she checked with her supervisors and they said they cleaned the room. Folks, I am not an expert, but this put fuel on the fire. Was it an illusion that the room was not made up? Maybe someone from housekeeping made up the room, another person came in put everything back the way we left it and we never knew the real story. I got frustrated at my lack of progress and said I would come to the front desk to speak to the PM MOD. I spoke to the PM MOD and explained everything to Fabio, the Director of Guest Services. He asked me what I wanted to have them to do. At Reunion Resort, this is an unacceptable question. If Fabio is the MOD, then he should be empowered to fix the problem. Perhaps, with some experience or training an MOD will present some solutions that would be appropriate for rectifying the problems. BTW, Fabio decided to comp one of our meals for the foul up from lunch, but he never addressed the bigger issue of the housekeeping error. To me this was a bigger issue. They never cleaned the room and they said they cleaned the room. Incidentally, they did clean the room by 5:45, I watch the cleaning crew strolling to the villa. Folks, I am not looking for a free night, but for crying out loud, this is a resort. Don't you make it right for the guest and make sure they walk away happy?

Overall, the service is agreeable and responsive, but you do have to keep after them about some things. There was confusion over heating the pool. Although a key reason we splurged for a rental house was for the pool, no one mentioned that most of these houses do not have heatable pools and it took days for them to find other options for us. It's wonderful to have housekeeping every day, although they spray way too much chemical cleaning products, leaving fumes throughout the house.

The photos of the home did not do it justice as it was much larger then it appeared in pictures and the decor/furnishings were amazing.

The rooms were spacious and well decorated. Full kitchen. Full dining room and living room. 50\" flat screen TV in living room and one almost as large in the master. We had 3 children who split a room with 2 double beds, and their grandparents who had their own room with queen bed and bath. The beds were VERY comfortable and we wish we could have spent more time in them. It was too cold to go to the pool area or golf, but these areas looked just as nice. This was a huge resort with houses, villas, condos, and hotel rooms. We booked through travelocity and got an incredible deal, however we were not offered a 3 bath option. When we called travelocity after we found out there were 3 bath options they wanted to charge us 900$. Initially, the resort said that they couldn't help us out since we booked through travelocity, but after I wrote a letter explaining our situation and that we did not know there were 3 bath options they responded immediately by email and said they would accomodate us for 30$/day! Bad opinion of travelocity (not the first time we have had problems with them). Kudos to the resort management. The housekeeper kept the villa spotless and the resort was a tip-free place (but would have gladly left her a tip). We also had a large deck with a full table and 4 chairs and 2 lounge chairs, too bad it was too cold to use it. Took about 10-15 min to drive to Disney property. There is a grocery store close by and a Duncan Donuts as well. Most of the other restaurants are only 5 minutes away. If you have a large family and can get a decent price we highly recommend this resort. It is quiet and a nice getaway after being around kids all day. We have nothing bad to say about this place. Parking at Disney is only 12 dollars per day at all parks, so don't worry about transportation.

It was HUGE and so spacious. It had a FULL kitchen stocked with pots/pan, glasses, cups, mugs, silverware, dishes, utensils to cook with, and baking pans. There was a separate dining room too. The only bathroom was the one in the one bedroom we had. It would have been nice to have a half bath for guests who came to visit. But, how often do you have guests visit while on you're on vacation? (Well, when you're staying here you're gonna wanna to invite EVERYONE you know! ) There was even a front-loading washer and dryer so bring your own detergent. The decor was beautiful. I actually got some great ideas that I'd like to incorporate in my own home. There were flat panel TVs in both the living room and bedroom. WITH a DVD player in both also. This was nice because we could have our little baby watch his DVDs in the bedroom while we watched TV in the living room. MASTER BATH: I write about this because it's a big deal to me. The master bath here is pretty close to my DREAM bathroom that I would like to have one day. A HUGE tub (no jets though) that I could lay in and my feet didn't/couldn't even touch the other end of the tub. There was a separate stand-up shower too and a double-vanity. LOVED THE BATHROOM. TENNIS: We were right by the tennis courts which you have to go the main center to book a court and pay like $20 for the day to play. NICE facility if you're a tennis player. POOL: The waterpark there was fantastic. The lazy river was a nice size too. For babies, I even noticed that they even provide you with complimentary swimmers, in case you forgot to bring yours. For kids, when we were there, they had activities in the lawn area to keep them entertained. My first visit to Reunion was in 09/2009. We went back 01/2010 with another young family, husband, wife, and 2-year old daughter. The guys went golfing and us girls went to the spa. Best facial I ever had. I've paid for a facial (The Breakers in West Palm Beach) and just felt like they washed my face...this however, made my pores feel so clean. They do extractions!

We eat out often but also wanted the convenience of eating healthy meals inside as a family and everything was available to do this.

The kitchen has everything you will need, even coffee and filters, creamer and sweet & low, and we bought juice, fruit, waffles, syrup and sodas for the fridge. We also had a washer and dryer right inside the room so we wouldn't have needed to pack so much for our 5 day stay. We were at Disney 3 days and animal kingdom a 1/2 day.

The other cool thing we did was attend the Disney Polynesian resorts Luau. The Reunion Resort concierge made us a reservation the night before and it was really a fun thing to do. The service was first class, the room service from the Clubhouse restaurant (pizza and nachos) was great. This resort is a cashless tipless resort so you are never really allowed to tip, although my Captain Morgan and Diet Coke that I ordered at the pool was $8.00 with a $2.00 service charge so that might be how they make up for me not tipping. The one negative was when I was sitting by the pool on a Friday at 1pm there wasn't a wait staff until I called and then someone came to take my order, they didn't come back but I was done sitting in the sun by then anyway. The pool on the 11th floor is a great spot to see a view of Epcot fireworks at 9pm. our suggestion for a family with young children is to bring a stroller to Disney or rent one for $15 for a single or $31 per day for a double stroller. Our 4 yr old did great for about 4 hours then got super tired and wanted to be carried back to the monorail, then the tram to our car.

You can also take a backpack to Disney which will be inspected but load it up with juice boxes, snacks, etc...I saw people eating at various times from large baggies filled with crackers, wheat thins. And the last suggestion, get the fast pass. We didn't and wished we would of because we did stand in line for splash mountain for 50 minutes but our 4 yr old loved it! Space Mountain is set to reopen after remodel at Thanksgiving 09. It's been shut down since March. We were at Disney October 22, 23 and 24...keep this in mind because this is when they have their not so scarey parade party for paid guests.

Who knew that staying at this so called 4 star resort was going to be more stress full then Disney??

I was notified 7 days prior to my arrival that the 2 best restaurants were going to be closed during my stay (of course that was 2 out of the 3 restaurants the kids eat free). 5 days before my arrival they then notified me that the kiddie spray park was going to be closed due to renovations, so I called the Manager and I was very upset. I understand it's low season, but c'mon you tell me 1week before I leave. No apology, nothing just if you want to reschedule, for another time??? You break that to 4 kids. It was not the end of the world, but i did work it out w/ the manager that they would honor the free kids menu at the other restaurants (so I thought). About 3 days before I left I contacted the Concierge to confirm (again) our reservation and find out exactly how the \"kids eat free\" works, he then notified me as of Sept 1st they are no longer honoring this?? I just spoke to the Manager 3days prior and he never said a word. I spoke w/another manager and she said their was nothing they could do, it was now the Hotel policy from Corporate and they would not honor it (they eventually did but what a disaster when we were checking out). Moving on to poolside dining, what a joke. Big sign at the bar, to call your food & drink order in and it will be delivered to you. Thanks, had to wait 1/2hr per drink! Golf - our Husbands are avid golfers, but choose to rent clubs at the resort instead of bringing their own. My husband was missing 2 clubs and have to call 2x in the middle of playing to have someone bring them to him (annoying). They did say they would comp his rental, (but another disaster during check out). Spa - this was about the only relaxing moment at this place, but it didn't last very long (over-charge, again the drama at checkout). Ok last thing - Kids activities, haha! I lied - not the last thing, the lazy river was filthy and when a few people complained (not me) they smurked and walked away. And let's not forget about the \"professional\" lifeguards. They can't let a little kid down the water slide who is less than 1/2inch shy of the height requirements, but they have no problem throwing water bottles to each other off the side of the cliff where it almost hit someone in the head, go figure?? Point is, don't stay here! There are so many better places to stay. If you can, stay on Disney property stay, and if your thinking about staying here don't, you will be better off at Motel 8, at least you will know what to expect!!", "Date": "October 7, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oxfordshire", "Title": "\u201cFantastic Resort for families\u201d", "Author": "OxfordshireDreamer", "ReviewID": "UR41658075", "Content": "We have stayed at many hotels throughout the US and Europe and definitely felt that this was of the top 3 hotels that we have stayed at.

We were in a 3 bedroom villa that was beautiful - Granite counters, stainless steel applicances and the unit itself was beautifully decorated. The kitchen was fully stocked with all the necessities you need - cutlery, pots, pans, and they even provide dishwasher detergent and laundry soap. They only thing they didn`t supply was dish soap which we had to buy. Although a washer and dryer were in the unit, they are very small and did not fit alot of clothes and did take a very long time to dry. With that being said, it was still nice to have that available. The beds were very comfortable and the master had a very large ensuite with a shower and separate soaker tub. The unit was extremely clean and they would send people to clean it daily. The resort was about a 15-20 min drive to Disney and about a half hr drive from the airport. The only time I found myself complaining was the staff - or lack thereof - at the pool. We waited 30 mins before we had the server come back to take our lunch orders. They only had 1 person serving the pool area and the deck area. They had daily activities for the kids which was great. They even had free swimming diapers available if you forgot them! They also had a beach volleyball area by the kids waterpark. There was a Publix supermarket across the street and for food there was a Chili`s restuaurant about a 5 mins drive away. Overall, this resort was fantastic, and our next stay in Florida will definately be at the Reunion Resort!", "Date": "August 26, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto", "Title": "\u201cCanadian family review of Ginn!\u201d", "Author": "the3hooks", "ReviewID": "UR38379998", "Content": "We are a family (mom, dad, teen son) from Ontario Canada, and stayed at the Ginn reunion Resort in Kissimmee from July 30 until Aug 5th.The property is very large and still growing. It is a mix of townhouse type condos and what appear to be private homes (most likely rented out).The main tower building is extremely nice, some what like the King Edward or Sutton Place Hotel. Check in was quick and courteous and our 1 bedroom was available (we checked in at 2pm).We were placed at the Seven Eagles complex building G. If you\u2019re looking for a location close to the main pool/fitness area this is it. Unit Itself: Nicely decorated and furnished, very clean, air conditioned, excellent kitchen with utensils/pots/toaster/kettle etc.Two TV's (not flat panel or HD) one DVD player Note: All units are individually owned, so furnishings TV type etc can vary, but are very similar so as not to spoil the feel of the resort itself. Key card entry and secure locks. Main door to condo building (3 floors w/ 2 units on each floor) automatically locks at 11pm until 6am.Washer and dryer located on main floor (free of charge!)Main bed comfortable, pull out couch-not so much! The bathroom lighting was not bright enough (ladies for your make-up) and the tap water, although not poisonous, smelt like sulphur! Not good for making tea or coffee, so be warned! Bedroom and living room had balconeys.Small but use able. Housekeeping: Very courteous, efficient and attentive. Extra towels, dish liquid sheets etc. sent without issue. DVD went on the fritz and it was replaced the next day (they offered a loaner but we weren\u2019t that desperate). Main Pool/Fitness area: Very nice. Large warm pool, 2 hot tubs, poolside bar with food. Covered area with tables to eat, or bartender will bring it right to you! Plenty of loungers, but as noted before in another review, limited tables with umbrellas. Plenty of towels. Overall very nice. Open very early until 11pm.Note: This is not the water park. We did not attend there, so cannot advice. Poolside food was excellent and drinks reasonable for a hotel. We did it as a treat. All charged to your room. NO TIPPING ALLOWED. You are told this specifically when checking in as it is already added to your initial cost. Golf Courses: Several. We don\u2019t play but they looked nice. The resort is very large but has many sidewalks and paths for walks encoded not use the restaurants in the main building, so we cannot comment. Rooftop pool is very nice, so if you stay in the main building, that would be your main pool. Security is very visible consisting of uniformed professional looking security personnel in marked vehicles. You will need a car to travel to area restaurants, food stores and of course attractions. If you go left when leaving the resort there is a Publix, Pizza Hut, 7 eleven, Walgreens drugs, gas station, Pappa Johns pizza, Subway. If you go right and travel west (under I4) there is a McDonalds,Chili's,two gas stations, another Publix, CVS drugs and other smaller stores. The area is under development so I am sure other restaurants are on the way. 192 Attractions, Disney etc, are about 15 minutes on I4.To get to any where further east on 192 (Irlo Bronson) turn left from the resort, follow the road until it T junctions with a main highway, go left to Poinciana Dr and then left again. A back route. Overall, a nice stay on a very nice property. We made use of a \"two for one\" type special. We are used to staying in places like Country Inn and Suites/Extended Stay/Hilton Garden Inn etc.This was a treat for us, so the deal was great. We would not pay full price for the rooms and we don\u2019t consider it quite a 5 Star resort (I think that the King Edward, Royal York and Casino Rama Hotels are better).

I wanted a great trip for my husband's birthday. I didn't want him to worry about anything and at the Reunion Grande he didn't. Positives: - VERY clean (and we looked)! We could not believe how clean (eat off the floor clean) our room was. - We reserved a 1 bedroom and was given a 2 bedroom unit. Although we didn't need all that space, we loved the extra room and extra shower/bathroom. The deck was large and with the breeze it was perfect for sitting out in the morning and evening. - The bed was awesome. Best sleeping I've had in a resort. Quiet, not a single noise could be heard. We never saw anyone in the elevators or on the 5th floor. It was as if the entire floor was empty. - The kitchen was perfect size. Had everything you would need to eat in. We didn't eat in the room, but if we were going to stay longer we would have definitely saved money by eating in for breakfast and lunch. - The Seven Eagles pool was fairly quiet with plenty of chairs. The water park was very active (as you can imagine) and wasn't a place for people who want to stay away from the crowds. We went to both pools, one each day and although the water park was more active for a couple with no children, it was still by far the better place to hang out for the day. - All restuarants are located in the Grande Tower - so if you stay in this part of the resort you don't need transportation. You will need transportation if you stay in a private home or villa. The pool food was mediocre and expensive for what you get. Skip it if you can. - They made special attention to prepare a gift from the resort for my husband's birthday. They gave him a nice wine opener set and a bottle of wine (which we gladly consumed in honor of his birthday). - Although some folks were not happy with the mandatory 20% service charge, I liked it. I was trying to give my husband a good trip for his birthday and it was nice not having to carry around cash to tip. It took a lot of pressure off me and my husband who is always reaching into his pocket tip. - The sushi chef - Chief Ha is fantastic. We eat sushi often and have never experienced such a wonderful burst of flavor and textures as we did with Chef Ha's creations. We had dinner reservations at Forte on Saturday night, but decided to cancel the reservation and remain at the lobby bar enjoying various creations for 3 hours! This was by far one of our best meals while also our lowest check. Very good value! - We had dinner at Eleven on Friday night. They don't take reservations, but we never noticed long waiting. The food was very good and the tapas style eating of small portions of various dishes was an experience we've not had. We split 3 dishes and then finished off with the choc. fondue. Again, for a several hour meal with drinks we thought the check was very reasonable. - We had breakfast, lunch and drinks at the Club House restaurant. Lunch was fantastic - get a split of onion rings and sweet potato fries as your side - incredible. Breakfast was okay, although not anything special. Drinks were good and not too expensive. - When checking out, I asked to for the business center so I could check-in for our JetBlue Flights. Tania (I hope that is right) was very nice and checked-in for me and printed the boarding passes. We are so glad she did that because when we arrived to the airport the line for JetBlue check-in was very long. With the boarding passes we just went up to the curbside check-in, paid $2 a bag and walked straight to the gate. Could be better: - With the emphasis on sun damage/cancer I was very surprised at the small number of umbrella's at each pool. They are premium and you must get to the pool upon opening or you won't get one. Reunion should invest in more umbrella's. For the folks that want to burn, they don't have to put the umbrella up, but for many they were jumping on open umbrella's before couples were leaving them. The slight movement that you are leaving - you will have your umbrella taken. We also saw a couple lose their umbrella when they both went into the pool together. My husband and I tag teamed our spot as to not lose our umbrella, but that didn't make for a very enjoyable morning and afternoon at the pool. - Everything is very spread out - more so than the maps show. There isn't much shade as the resort is still fairly new. Therefore, walking is in direct sunlight. A better screening of trees for shade along walking paths would cut down on the number of shuttle runs. For now, take the shuttle, but as the resort matures hopefully there will be tree lined shade along the walking paths. - The menu's get a little boring if you aren't eating in your room. Food rotation might entice more people to eat in the restaurants. - There aren't any stores in walking distance and the lobby store is very limited on what it offers. I forgot a few things and wasn't able to buy them at the lobby store. We didn't have a car, so there wasn't much other option but to go without. - I thought the resort, for the price, could include some bottle water in the room daily. A nice touch would be two bottles per person. - Service could be better. I thought for the few people eating in the restaurants the service should be better. I ran out of iced tea often and that is something that is easy to keep an eye on. - The breakfast buttet could be improved. In fact, with so few guests eating the $15 breakfast, they should expand the main menu so the food is fresh and not sitting out all morning. It would probably be more cost efficient for both the resort and for the guests. Lessons learned: - never, ever, arrange for a car service. We booked backstage limo (also known as limo123). 1 hour late picking us up at the airport with excuse after excuse as to why it was somehow normal for them to miss picking us up. Took 4 phone calls to get someone to the airport. 20% Gratuity is not \"optional\" it is mandatory. They were late picking us up at the hotel for our return flight. Rent a car so you are not held captive at the resort and your time is not wasted by the lateness of others. Our trip was perfect except for the limo service (which was the highest rated limo service in the Orlando area). Learn from my $200 mistake and rent a car. Orlando is easy to get around. You can park for free at Reunion. Other facts: - We met very nice people, but I had a feeling we might be one of only a few guests at the resort. Everyone we met \"owned\" a villa, home or condo at the resort. We didn't meet anyone that wasn't an owner. The resort is more of a lifestyle vs. a hotel. It has a home feel to it and is not like a Ritz or Four Seasons. It has a casual feeling and we felt like we were coming home each night when we returned to our room. It was very comfortable. If you want a place that is away from the Disney crowd, this is it. Still close to everything, but yet far away. A quick flight from Wash DC on JetBlue. I couldn't decide between Omni or Reunion. I chose Reunion for the the guest rooms. We are glad we did.

We stayed in a 3 room villa, that was fantastic. very large, fully equipped and beds were truly the best we have slept on at any resort. Housekeeping was generally good, although on 2d day after a long day at Disney we got back to our villa at 5 pm and house keeping had still not cleaned the room. we were told that it takes house keeping sometimes until 6 to get around to clean rooms. The resort is much larger than what the map they hand you when you check in indicates. we thought we could walk to the water park from our room, but in reality it was a 2 mile walk. So we were constantly driving to the swim park. Also the last day we were there, they closed the swim park to any additional people at around 1 pm because it was too crowded. If I had a young family and we just got off a plane and were looking forward to the swim park there would have been a lot of unhappy faces in my family. Luckily we were already in. Also, they don't let you bring your own drinks into the swim park. Watch out for those $10 pool side drinks for the kids. Ouch!! We had 2 meals on site and both were excellent. the tappas restaurant on the top floor of the main building reallly was excellent. When we first arrived we had lunch at the golf restaurant. Service was slow although the place was not crowded. Took 20 minutes to get drinks. Hostess just stood at main area in front of us and made no effort to move things along and help out server. oddest thing about the resort was that it appears not yet 50% completed. Our building was 2 miles from the swim park and there was just this vast wasteland in between, waiting for construction to begin. Kind of takes away from the lush pictures you see on the web site. Also, we asked for a late check out and we were told no. This struck me as odd because (1) the day before, house keeping did not get to our room until 5 (see above); and (2) the 12 buildings in our area of the resort were pretty much empty. At night, there were maybe 6 cars in front of our building that had approximately 16 units in it. The other buildings parking lots were equally empty. Finally, the concierge service was excellent, although I was surprised they did not offer disney tix at a discount that many other resorts provide when they are bought in bulk. One more thing, this time I mean finally, by the end of your stay, you will get tired of seeing the 20% resort fee/gratuity added on constantly. Our room cost $229 but after all the add ons, it was more like $290 a night.

The waterpark opens at 11 and closes at 4 (5 on Fri, Sat, and Sun); we found it a bit inconvenient when looking for a morning or afternoon only activity. The fitness room, while adequate, left a lot to be desired. Small, under a/c'ed, no water, teeny towels, crammed w/mediocre equipment and over inflated balls/bosu. Other than the hotel, there are no good restaurants in the immedate vicinity--you'll have to take a drive to Orlando.

We didn't mind it but saw some other reviewers did. Parking lots at the water park, and hotel were ample.

We are Disney fans and only stayed at Disney resorts since I was a little girl. Nothing could compare to this experience. It was amazing from the moment we drove through the gated extrance till the time we left. We had a 3/3 condo and it was decorated nicer than I could have ever imagined. It was so nice to have 3 bathrooms, getting ready in the mornings was a breeze. We were going to stay at one of Disney's Deluxe resorts and priced out that it would have been 1500 dollars more for the 2 nights because we would have gotten 2 rooms to fit the 6 of us. You really can not beat what you get for the money. The waterpark was so much more than I imagined. The kids loved it and did not want to leave. Whenever we left the property they kept asking when we were going back to the hotel. The lazy river was amazing, took us about 10 minutes to get around it, never seen anything like that at a resort. The kids waterpark was so well thought out. 2 kid slides and tons of sprayers, the temp of the water was 85 degrees and felt wonderful. We did not get to do to much on property because we had a very full weekend but plan on going back soon and just staying at the resort and not doing any parks at Disney because frankly the kids would have rather stayed at the resort and that is fine with my husband and I. You could litterally spend a week here and never leave the property. There is a Publix about 1/2 mile away from the entrance so we would just go pick food up to have in the unit. So we would not worry about going to get breakfast or snacks. The kitchen was awesome and had everything you could possibly want or need. We enjoyed eating on the balcony and being able to just relax in the unit. If someone wanted to go to bed they did, went in the room and shut the door. It was great traveling with a family. At a regular hotel it is almost like you are cintantly telling the kids o quiet down, or go to sleep because someone else is trying to fall asleep in the bed next to them. Here at Ginn it was like living in a house and I will recommend this resort to everyone I talk to. I know we felt great after the long weekend, we said that usually we are worn out and exhausted but I think by having a big unit like we did (about 1800 sq. ft.) we spent a lot more time in the rental and got to relax. When we stay at Disney property it is almost like we can not wait to get out of the rooms because there is nothing to do in the rooms and the kids are way to confined. There maid service could have been a little better but all in all it was just fine. Our building did not have but only 2 other couples in it so that was probably why it took longer for them to restock our room. If you have the chance to go to this resort....DO IT!!! You will not regret it at all. Oh and the view are unbelievable, we had an amazing golf course view.

We wanted a 5 star resort where we could be pampered and enjoy a luxurious experience. We booked a two bedroom condo in the Reunion Grande which is the main (and only tower) hotel building on the site. I received an email from our personal concierge Derek a few weeks before our scheduled arrival introducing himself and asking if we wanted him to stock our condo unit with groceries. There is a Publix nearby and we rented a car, so this was not necessary. Our rate for this condo was an average of $350 per night so our expectations were high. We were looking forward to a week in a beautiful condo on a resort where we felt the service would match the $ paid. There is no question that our condo was magnificent. It was huge and beautifully decorated with lovely bathrooms and a very modern kitchen with stainless steel appliances. We chose the Grande building because we wanted to be in the main building, not on a street nearby. We wanted access to the restaurant on the 11th floor and the pool as well. The Grande also has a gift shop, and a nice lobby with a sushi bar that opens at 5pm each day. While we enjoyed the resort, there were a few issues that were a little hard to overlook. Our stay was in late August which is not a very busy time in Orlando and we found out the resort was operating at about 40% occupancy. Even though there were probably more staff than guests, the service was quite poor. For example, turn down service was offered through the hotel website for our condo, and we had to call down the first night to ask for it. It was hit or miss - sometimes they came, sometimes they didn't. When they did come, they would turn down the beds and leave - they did not replace our dirty towels with new one's, they were simply left on the bathroom floor. I found this very odd. The light inside the shower stall was burned out when we arrived, I called down to the desk to report it and it took almost 8 hours before it was replaced ( I had to shower in the dark). We had a very unfortunate incident whereby my husband's wallet went missing from our condo - we searched the entire unit inside and out and it was nowhere to be found. We had not left the resort that day and saw the wallet in the morning before we left for the Seven Eagles Pool Pavillion, when we returned from the pool late in the day we could not find the wallet. I went down to the front desk to report the missing wallet and spoke with Front Desk Supervisor who stared blankly at me and asked me what I wanted her to do! At the very least she could have said she was sorry to hear what had happened and offer to call resort security! I was very disappointed in her lack of compassion. We did meet with security and they were wonderful, concerned and helpful. It is important to also mention that as we were searching for the missing wallet we actually lifted up the mattress on one of the beds and saw a pair of underwear that did not belong to us!! I was shocked that this was possible in a 5 star resort, shocked and somewhat disgusted to say the least. The Ginn Reunion has the makings of what could be a 5 star resort, but sadly to say they are not there yet. The property itself is lovely, albeit very spread out. Transportation is required to get to the Seven Eagles Pool and the Waterpark. If you are relying on the resort's transportation be prepared to wait 15 minutes or more for a shuttle. I had to ask the pool attendant to call for a shuttle 3 times before one finally arrived. I believe the Ginn has the potential to be an excellent resort option for people wanting luxury in Orlando, I will probably wait a few years before staying there again.", "Date": "August 31, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201cThe best ever!\u201d", "Author": "IzzyDorset", "ReviewID": "UR19053306", "Content": "We've stayed in Orlando many times (usually timeshare resorts like Westgate) but we came across this resort by accident on the web and just seeing the pictures of the pirate ship in the pool for my 4 your old son made it appealing.

The entire room is tiled, except for the living area, and bedrooms. There is high-quality carpets in the room. The kitchen, wow! There are stainless steel appliances, granite countertops, cups, mugs, salad making bowls, utensils, and anything you need to create a home made meal.

We returned because the first trip was awesome. However , we had rented directly through the owner that time. We stayed for THREE nights this time and were in FOUR different villas! We had 7 people in our party. The 1st villa we checked into had no dining room table (nor was there room for one) and only had a bar type seating for 3. We called the front desk and they apologized & moved us (said it was an engineering mishap to that unit) We were moved to a 2 story villa that seemed OK until that night when we realized 2 of the bedrooms faced the highway. The noise and street lights kept us up all night. Called front desk in AM and they said they would move us. They apologized and said those units are known for those problems. We were moved into another villa (in another section) that was beautiful. All was perfect until that next AM when we were told we would have to move due to the owner of that unit coming in! Off we went to villa #4. Keep in mind it's not easy moving 7 people w/belongings as well as food, refrig, bathroom items etc. It took us close to 2 hours each time we moved. I thought at the very least, we would be offered a discount for a round of golf. All we heard was \"sorry for the inconvenience.\" It's a beautiful resort, but the customer service left a bad taste and we won't be back. Too many other choices out there. We aren't people who are hard to please, but a 5 star resort needs to hire/train quality customer service. Just a note from mgmt along with the bill acknowledging what happened would have sufficed.

This was our second trip to Orlando. Each time, we chose to stay 3 nites on site and 3 nites off site. Last year it was the Caribbean Beach at Disney and then the Hyatt Cypress. This year it was the Royal Pacific for Universal and Ginn Reunion. So I don't have the breadth of experience others might have. I have also never rented a condo before. If you just like a place to crash, there are many cheaper alternatives available. But the quality of a place affects how much I enjoy my vacation, how well I sleep, etc... If this applies to you, read on. I find it very hard to believe that we can, in Orlando, top this resort for the money we paid ($234 a night for the July 4th weekend. I presume the prices were higher for the holiday.) I also don't think that the resort is clearly marketing their amenities because I think they are unmatched (based upon my internet research) in this price range. WHY? 1. Quality: We paid for a superior room that was decorated as luxuriously as any 4 or 5 star hotel. It was immaculate and beautiful. The master suite and the living room had separate balconies overlooking the golf course. The balconies were large enough to hold tables and chairs. Granite counters, top of the line appliances, Cuisnart pots, Henkel knives, washer and dryer, spacious rooms, flat screen tvs in every room, free cable internet access and daily maid service. Tech support for our internet coneection issue was in our room within 30 minutes. You simply can not get a room with these amenities at a hotel or, I presume, a rented condo with the quality and number of amenities this resort has. Of course, I haven't even mentioned golf ... Which leads to my next category. 2. Hotel Services with the benefits of a condo: I didn't fully realize this until we stayed there. You have 24 hour food service, 24 hour concierge, food and drink service at the main pool, and all of the other amenities listed in other reviews. You can have your refrigerator stocked with food before you get there. The lobby of the main building is very impressive and beautiful. 3. Service: This was my Ginn Reunion moment. When I asked Jen from the Concierge how I could get tickets to Seaworld on line, she offered to have me email them to her and she would have a driver deiliver the documents to my doorstep. When I discovered that I couldn't do that, she offered to immediately send a driver to pick me up and bring me to the 24 hour business center. She suggested I come by driver, have a cocktail at the rooftop pool bar, and have a driver take me back to the room. When we left our jewelry in the safe, Jen called me personally to ensure me they would fedex the jewelry to us. 4. Location: We were in a small buidling on the edge of the resort. It was quite and peaceful, which was good for us. I got to the resort exits in 8 minuteson the highway. We had a spectacular view of the fireworks from our balcony. 5. Amenities: They are described by other reviewers and the company's website. As others said, the water park alone is a reason -- for kids and parents -- to stay there. It is huge and has great service and family entertainment.", "Date": "July 10, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Altoona, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cCentral Florida's Best Kept Secret - keep it that way\u201d", "Author": "150thBucktailPA", "ReviewID": "UR17666997", "Content": "I really hesitate to review this resort because I want it to stay the hidden gem we found it to be.... but we have fallen in love with the place so much, that I'm going to. And we are already planning on returning here for a longer stay ,and possibly with a short stay at the one near St. Augustine around the same time next summer. That is if the economy doesn't continue to slack. We stayed here the last week of June, and were looking for few day layover while on our way to the southwestern Gulf Coast. Didn't necessarily want to do the theme parks and their water parks, wanted to avoid the crowds, but wanted some action that a 5 and 10 year old would appreciate. While looking at just about every hotel and resort option in the Orlando area and reading the overwhelming reviews on TA of the hotels and resorts glazing my eyes, I determined that they were all either used and abused due to popularity, overpriced, having to suffer through timeshare proposals, or all of the above. Then I stumbled upon the Ginn Reunion Resort website. It looked great on the website. 3 Golf courses, swimming pools scattered around the resort, a resort waterpark with lazy river and water slide, dress codes in certain places, gated and secure community, food and amenities, a spa, and the list continues on. But I figured it would be super expensive and out of our average middle class league. WAS I WRONG!! We were able to book (what we would consider) an upscale 2 bedroom/2 bath villa and were placed not far from the resort waterpark at an EXTREMELY reasonable price when compared to the other comparable resorts and hotels. I used the website as a source while speaking with a customer service representative originally from Wisconsin. She was great, very patient, very polite, and very knowledgable. I figured there would be hidden costs to go along with the great rate or probably a sales pitch so I asked her about it. The only extra costs to go along with the rate was the tax and a 9% daily resort fee. So I took it and hoped for the best not quite knowing what I was getting into even from the high percentages of positive reviews. It was an awesome experience from the moment we pulled into the Resort Front Security Gate... through the resort... up to the Reunion Grande where the check-in is located... to the villa... and the waterpark. The entire place is immaculate, clean, and beautiful. The resort staff we encountered were always polite, smiling, and professional. The villa had probably the most comfortable beds we've ever slept on. The villa was well-stocked with the expected necessities, very clean, spacious, and well decorated. Granite countertops, throughout. 3 large HD FlatScreen TV's with DVD players. Kitchen had stainless steel appliances and quality cabinetry. High quality carpeting where it would be expected. All the furniture was of a very good quality, as was the balcony furniture. The balcony had 2 points of entry via the living room and the master bedroom. The master bath was completely tiled with jacuzzi tube and a separate shower that could fit 10 people. It also had a separate room for the toilet. It was well stocked. The second bath was tiled and had a tub shower combo, and like the other was well-appointed and stocked. The \"village\" we were located in also had nice playground in the middle surrounded by the villa buildings. In one word, this place was \"OUTSTANDING\" A++++.", "Date": "July 8, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "usa", "Title": "\u201cPerfect Florida vacation spot!\u201d", "Author": "utahgirl471", "ReviewID": "UR17647068", "Content": "This was our first time staying at this resort.

There was a small pool in our neighborhood, and a waterpark with a lazy river ride close by. At the water park they had music and games for the kids lead by the staff of the Ginn which was a lot of fun. We spent most of our time at the seven eagles pavillion pool, where they had plenty of lounge chairs around the pool, noodles for the guests to use, a covered area with tables and chairs where you could get out of the sun and order food. They also had a pool table and ping pong for the kids. There is a small gym there too... although it's not the \"world class fitness center\" the web site claims. Just a few treadmills and a couple of pieces of resistance equipment. But it's still very nice. In their main building you can go up to the 11th floor and there is a restaurant and another pool with large padded lounge chairs, and you can see both Disney and Epcot's fireworks from this level. It's a great way to spend the evening. At night at the 7 eagles pool they put up a huge movie screen and show movies and make popcorn.

Overall experience is really good except for a few issues we faced. First of all, front desk people were really unfriendly during the check in. No greeting, no smile, no welcome. I felt like they were annoyed by us even though we were the only ones in the lobby (at 5:30 pm). They didn\u2019t even show us on the map our room location until I asked them to do so. The room was great. We were staying in Heritage Crossing neighborhood, which is right next to the entrance and approximately 3 mins drive from the main building. We were on the 1st floor in 3brd. condo, but didn\u2019t use other 2 brds, which were locked (we originally booked 1 brd room). The villa had very nice kitchen with granite countertops and all appliances, pots and pans, silverware, paper towels, dishwasher with soap, microwave, etc. Bedroom had a garden tub + shower and was very spacious. Both living room with the queen size sofa sleeper and the bedroom with king size bed had TVs and DVD players, which was really great \u2018cause we brought lots of children\u2019s DVDs with us. It was also very quiet despite of the fact that we had 1 other family of 5 living above us in the same building. Everything was very clean and neat. Housekeeping came every day, cleaned, washed dishes, changed towels. Also, it was so nice and convinient that we had a washer and a drier in the unit. After unpacking we went to have dinner at the resort\u2019s Clubhouse right next to the main building. I knew from resort\u2019s web site that kids under 5 eat free if you choose the buffet. However neither our seating hostess nor our server mentioned anything about that. Instead they brought children\u2019s menu to choose from. After I asked them if it\u2019s true that the buffet is free for children under 5, they agreed, but it was like I was pulling those word out of their mouths with the pliers and then they insisted again that I would choose something from the kids menu. I said that we\u2019re gonna stick with the buffet, and after all they ended up charging me for my 4 y.o full price anyway. So, after this experience we decided not to use their eateries and stick with some simple cooking, since we had such a great kitchen. I went to nearby Publix (very good grocery store), 5 mins drive from Heritage Crossing, and bought everything we needed \u2013 bread, turkey, cheese, tomatoes, lettice, pasta, already roasted whole chicken, hot dogs, cereal, milk, orange juice, wine. I didn\u2019t do much cooking, but we saved a lot by doing this and I don\u2019t regret. You wouldn\u2019t be able to do this in a regular hotel with no kitchen. We used the sofa sleeper, since there were 3 of us, but as I found out there were no sheets, blankets or pillows for it provided in the unit. So I had to call front desk and ask for the sheets, pillow and a blanket. 5 mins later guy showed up, but brought only 3 sheets\u2026 no pillow, no blanket. The other negative moments to be short are: 1) We ran out of paper towels one day and had to call front desk 4 times (every hr) to get it\u2026 4 hrs later we finally got them; 2) Front desk said there won\u2019t be any dive-in movies during the week, however, they had a movie on Wednesday and Thursday nights\u2026 we missed Wednesday night children movie because of that, which was really upsetting, since my daughter really wanted to see it. On Thursday I called concierge to confirm the time of Thursday night movie and was told that it will begin at 9 pm. I asked them if they\u2019re sure, because yesterday it stated at 7:30, and they said \u201cyes, we\u2019re sure\u201d and they even put me on hold to ask someone else to double check. When we got to Seven Eagles pool at 9 pm\u2026 you guessed it\u2026 the movie was over! My husband ended up calling the management and said something to them, and after all they played a movie for a 2nd time. The water park, lazy river and all the pools were really great and we had so much fun there, especially our daughter, of course. The water play area was never crowded and we could easily find plenty of chairs at any time of the day. However, they kept closing water park area due to the T-storms that occurred almost every day after 4-5 pm. Personally we thought it was ridiculous, because sometimes it never even rained and you wouldn\u2019t see a lightning, but as soon as their staff heard couple of thunder sounds, they immediately shut down the park and kicked everybody out. Good thing that we had a pool at our neighborhood, right next to our room. And it was closed only once. The rest of the time we could enjoy it after we were kicked out of the water park. Next to the \u2018big\u2019 pool there was also a 1 foot deep kiddy pool, which my daughter really enjoyed. There were also 3 cranes living in the near by swamp whom we liked very much. They would come to our patio as soon as we would start eating and took the bread out of our hands. They were very cute and friendly. The view to the golf course was great. All neighborhoods and the main building are pretty far from each other, so be ready to do a lot of walking or rent/have a car. They had a shuttle though that can take you around the resort, but you have to call front desk first and then wait until it gets to you door and picks you up. Also, their kids camp play room was closed for renovation, which was a bummer, because based on its pictures and Ginn\u2019s TV channel coverage was really cool with lots of toys, games, etc. Due to remodeling they moved kids camp room to Heritage Crossing and when we went with my daughter to check it out we were really disappointed. It was an empty room with plain walls and 1 small TV set. No sings of decorations of toys. My daughter didn\u2019t want to stay there for a minute. They said they do some crafts if you sign up your kid, take them to the water park or to the small play ground that they have. I wouldn\u2019t want my 4 y.o to do any of those. It was too hot to stay outside and be on the playground and I wouldn\u2019t trust anyone to take her to the water park, so we didn\u2019t use their kids camp.", "Date": "July 7, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cWhat a resort, what a pool, definitely stay here!!\u201d", "Author": "tangek", "ReviewID": "UR17133559", "Content": "My husband and I are frequent travelers, and we have just added a new favorite to our list \u2013 Ginn Reunion Resort. Ginn is pronounced with a soft G, as in \u201cGuinness\u201d \u2013 named after the founder Bobby Ginn. The resort is part of a huge complex that stretches for miles with a hotel, multiple golf courses, a water park, and owner occupied homes. We traveled as a party of 4 adults and a 7 month old baby. We decided to rent a 3 bedroom house in the deluxe category with private pool, and were assigned to 1103 Watson Court. What a spectacular house! The main gate has 24 hour security. Upon arrival, we were given a pass to put in the window of our car so that we had access to come and go as we pleased. Check in was at the main building, and was very smooth. The House - We heard that all homes are individually owned, but centrally rented out by Ginn Reunion. So keep in mind that our description below is for the house that we stayed at. They must have common standards, but could be personalized differently based on the owners. -The house was 2nd to the end on a cul-de-sac and was perfectly quiet for a good night\u2019s sleep. The house had a 2 car garage, which was really convenient to keep the car cool in Florida\u2019s summer heat. The key to the front door was a key card, just like a hotel. Just inside the foyer was a lovely mosaic surrounded by tile floors. The first room, off to the right, was a study with a desk, internet connection, small flat screen TV, and a pullout sofa. On the left-hand side of the hallway was a laundry room with a full size washer and dryer, a large utility sink, iron and ironing board, and an entrance to the garage. The hotel provided two single-usage packs of Tide detergent. - The hallway led to a spectacular open kitchen with granite countertops and all the basic appliances \u2013 refrigerator, dishwasher, microwave, and coffee maker. The cabinets were stocked with all of the dishes, pots, pans, and utensils that one needs for meals. In fact, we cooked pancakes for breakfast and grilled burgers for dinner, and didn\u2019t need to supply anything but the food. Ginn Reunion supplied a small Palmolive dish soap and sponge, and the maids ran the dishwasher for us each day. - The dining room table was next to the kitchen and had seating for 8 people. Beyond the dining area was an open great room that had a sofa, chairs, a TV, and a fireplace. We also found another wired internet connection in the living room. The living room had a door that opened onto a back patio overlooking a nature preserve and a golf course in the distance. - Off to the side, behind the living room, was a bedroom and full bath. The room had a king sized bed, ample closet space and a shower/tub combination in the bath. The floor was carpeted. - The bedroom, as well as the living/dining area, both had entrances to a small private outdoor swimming pool / Jacuzzi. The pool was surrounded by a patio with an outdoor table, chairs, and lounge chairs. There was also a large gas grill. The pool was small in size, but still comfortable for floating around and relaxing. The Jacuzzi had seating for 4 people. Note that the pool was not heated, which was fine in June but might have been cold in the winter. We also couldn\u2019t find a net to clean out the pool, but when we called the front desk to inquire, they sent someone to clean it for us. - Upstairs, the master bedroom was spacious and comfortable, with hardwood floors, a king sized bed, large closet, desk, and a TV on a stand with dresser drawers. The bed had a Simmons mattress and was extremely comfortable. The private bathroom was spectacular, with a Jacuzzi tub, glass enclosed shower with stone floor, a toilet, and two separate sinks. The bedroom had 2 ceiling fans! Just outside the bedroom was an entrance to a 2nd story balcony (above the patio) with a table and chairs and a nice view. - Also upstairs was a wet bar and lounge area with super-comfy leather chairs that reclined flat and a game table. The wet bar had a sink, small refrigerator, and counter space to prepare snacks. - Behind that area was a 3rd bedroom with double bed, carpeted floors, a TV, a large closet, and a full bath with a shower / tub combination. - We requested a crib for our son. The hotel had forgotten to set it up for our arrival, but delivered a Pack-and-Play promptly after we phoned them. Note that it came w/ a regular bed sheet, not a fitted crib sheet. We were worried about this, but after wrapping the sheet tightly around the pad at the bottom of the crib, it stayed tightly for the 6 nights that we spent at the hotel. - The home appeared to be furnished by an interior decorator, as the theme of wood, wicker, and leather was tastefully established throughout the home, and all of the furniture appeared to be top quality. Having stayed at many 5 star hotels, the furniture was definitely on par. - Our house was cleaned daily, just like a hotel room. We did have some minor issues with the times that the maids came. Two days, they came quite early in the morning (before 10am) before we left for the day, and we asked them to return later. They then returned quite late in the day (after 5pm), and we ended up sitting around the house waiting for them to finish cleaning. None of the maids spoke English, so it was difficult to communicate what we wanted. The Water Park Perhaps our favorite part of Ginn Reunion was the water park. The complex is open only to resort guests and golf club members, so it wasn\u2019t overcrowded and we easily found lounge chairs both days that we went. The lazy river was so much fun, we doubt that we\u2019ll be satisfied with a \u201cnormal\u201d pool again!! The resort provided tubes (including a child\u2019s tube that our 7 month old baby could use with supervision) to float around. The current was strong enough that you literally could let it take you around in circles. The course had several waterfalls, twists, and turns to keep it interesting. Off to the side of the lazy river, but connected, was a \u201cregular pool\u201d area with a gradual entrance where small children could play with their families. And in the center of the lazy river was a water slide for use by older children and adults, We loved the slide, and saw everyone from 5 year olds to grandmothers making use. About 20 feet away from the lazy river area was a dedicated children\u2019s facility with lots to hold their attention \u2013 2 water slides, stairs to climb, rigging (like on a ship), ropes to swing on, and random sprays / splashes of water at unexpected moments. Everyone seemed to be having fun. And there were lifeguards throughout. We also ordered food at the pool. We were pleasantly surprised by the quality of the sandwiches, which were freshly made and tasty. The Main Hotel Building At the main hotel building, we also saw a rooftop lap pool on the 11th floor. It had great views, and would probably be better suited than the water park for people looking to get exercise via swimming laps. The 11th floor also had an indoor Asian fusion tapas bar that looked really cool, although we didn\u2019t try. We dined twice at Forte, the American steak and seafood house on the main floor. The short rib special was excellent, and the light and tasty Chilean sea bass also deserves a mention. And the service was attentive \u2013 the manager helped us select a wine, and the waiters remembered what we had ordered previously despite 4 nights in between visits. Be forewarned \u2013 the prices are reminiscent of NY. We were able to walk from our house to the main hotel building by cutting across one of the golf courses. The walk was very scenic, with beautiful flowers, trees dripping with Spanish moss, and manicured greens. Unfortunately, we don\u2019t golf so we can\u2019t comment on the courses from that perspective, but they looked quite nice. We were on the lookout for wildlife, and saw deer, rabbits, a variety of birds, and cute little lizards. Note that the resort is tipless and cashless, so use your keycard for everything. The hotel has ~8 concierge staff members in place to help answer your questions or make arrangements. They contacted us in advance of arrival to ask if they could help, and also greeted us to see if we had questions while sitting in the lobby. The complex is so large that the resort offers a complementary shuttle van to pick you up and drop you off anywhere within the complex. And when my father forgot his hat at the restaurant, the staff delivered the hat directly to our home within minutes of us placing a call to the restaurant. Great service! During our stay, we chatted with several members of the staff at both the water park and the lobby / front door. Everyone commented that Ginn Reunion was a great place to work \u2013 it\u2019s always a good sign when the employees are happy. The Surrounding Neighborhood Outside the complex, we found a Dunkin Donuts and CVS just a block down the road. A Publix is being built across the street, but for now, there is another Publix supermarket at Championsgate, about 1.5 miles down the road near Rt. 4. We also grabbed a late night bite at Chile\u2019s restaurant in Championsgate, which was bustling even at 10pm. We drove from the resort to both Disney World and Epcot. It was about 6 miles to the main gates using the back road alongside Dunkin Donuts, or slightly longer on the main highway. Either way was easy to drive. In summary, we loved coming back to such a beautiful home each night, and found it very easy to get around the sights that we planned to see. The resort\u2019s facilities were quite relaxing. We could not have asked more from our vacation.

It was truly a lovely and relaxing vacation spot. It is very clean and designed nicely. The property is so huge that you do feel somewhat \"disconnected,\" but a visit to the water park pool or the 11th floor bar/pool allows you to feel much more a part of the \"resort\" atmosphere. The property is upscale and appears to cater to its members. It is very golf-centered and has 3 beautiful courses. In fairness to the staff, they do make guests feel as welcome as members in the restaurants and bars. The water park and pool is absolutely wonderful. My 5 year old son learned to swim here and felt comfortable since he could walk right in to the water. The lazy river was amazing! What a gorgeous pool area. The Seven Eagles (main) pool, however, was a bit disappointing. It was very dirty on the bottom, which made it uninviting. Overall, the service is wonderful. Our 3 bedroom villa was immaculate and well-maintained with lovely appliances and furnishings. It would have been nice if movies were available either by pay per view or by rental. The 11th floor bar/pool area is very beautiful and has a great view. You can view the Disney fireworks from this rooftop spot, although they are distant and hard to locate if you are not up at the railing. All in all, it is a very tasteful and relaxing spot, although it caters more to adults. The Ginn Resort is quieter and much more peaceful than the Disney hotels and far less stimualting. It is a great place for young children who are already stimulated by all the theme parks.

Just let us know up front! 3-- We were promised homes next to each other yet we were blocks apart which was not very condusive to sharing in the fun as a unit! B-- Food We had the buffet breakfasts included, it was good but same old every day \"scrambled eggs, potatoes, sausage, bacon\" The fruit bar was good, the toasters took at least 5 minutes to heat up (Everyone was laughing) If you wanted juice it was an extra charge. Lunch was a hurry since we were playing 36 holes , ordered off \"quick\" menu all were $9.00 (hot dog BBQ pork or turket wrap) We ate dinner off campus except the last night, we ate at their signature steak house. Food excellent, however when we went to pay they would not accept our Ginn credit cards! we had to scramble for the $1,600.00. Not very nice!! C-- Golf. Courses were not in good shape at all, fairways hard as airport runways They cant blame a drought either since a few people we met were so mad they cancelled rounds & went 20 minutes away to \"green\" courses for only $60 per round. They need to water or redesign irrigation somehow . It was brutal Don't get me wrong, if they would have been in any playable condition they would have been great, they had some really nice hole layouts. Many ,many traps but hardly any rakes. The traps were enormous, & to get to the traps & back would take minutes, we gave up raking at many! The drink carts were limited & seldom available. One girl said she was the only one servicing all courses. We palyed only the Palmer & Watson courses since the Nicklaus greens were being aerated supposedly! (people did play we found out) BEWARE there's no break after 1'st nine on either so be sure to have a bottle with you for water refills. We've been to Doral, Innisbrook, PGA Tampa campuses past three years, this facility needs to either fire the manager in charge of golf or really get some classes in golf accomodations. The greenskeeper should be fired as well!! Believe me the Watson course was burned out terribly it was worse then public courses I've played on in Newark new jersey. (No kidding!!) The greens themselves were brown & really quick (actually unfair) I know this seems a little bitter, but if you spend near $1,600 for golf , flights & incidentals for 3 and a half days you hope to play on grass at least.

It is truly a 5-star, luxury resort. We rented a 5 bedroom superior home for a week. Our home was gorgeous! The kitchen had granite countertops and every amenity you could think of. We had a dinette area that seated four, two barstools, a separate dining room that seated six, laundry room, 1/2 bath, and a huge 2-story living room with sofa, loveseat, and chair. The master bedroom was on the main level with a king bed, bath with garden tub, 2 separate vanities, toilet in separate room, and huge glass shower. The upstairs had a balcony that overlooked the main level. There were 2 more queen bedrooms upstairs and 2 more two twin bedrooms. There were also 2 full baths upstairs. Every bedroom and the living room had flat screen TVs on the wall. We had a screened in lanai that housed another table with four padded chairs and 2 padded lounge chairs. We had our own inground pool with spill-over hot tub. Pool and hot tub heat were not included in the price. Since the water was warm enough, we opted not to pay the $50 a day to heat our private pool and hot tub. The resort has numerous pools. Our kids loved the main pool with the waterpark the best. There was a large flume waterslide (must be 42\") that landed in the beautifully landscaped lazy river. There was also a huge kids splash park that had an additional 2 smaller slides for the little ones. This pool has complimentary beach towels to use while there. There is also a beach volleyball court. We were there over Spring Break and although the pool was busy, we never had any trouble finding lounge chairs. There are lifeguards on duty during the waterpark open hours of 10 am - 5 pm. The other pools on the resort are open until 11 pm. Our neighborhood, the Homestead, also had their own private heated pool, kiddie pool, and hot tub. No one was ever at this pool, so we enjoyed complete privacy at this pool after the waterpark closed. This resort is gorgeously landscaped. I want to live at this resort! Our home came with daily maid service. This is included in the price of staying at the resort. We booked through RCI, our timeshare website, not the resort and still received this complimentary service. This is a no-tipping resort, so do not tip anyone whether housekeeping, valets, or waiters. We did not purchase any food or drink while at this resort. It is a very pricey resort, and we were minutes from a Publix, McDonalds's, Pizzeria, and Chili's. The resort is 2 miles from Interstate 4, and 4 miles from Highway 192 where every imaginable restaurant is located. With traffic, the resort is about 10 minutes from Disney, 15 minutes from Sea World. Since we are a family with 4 kids, we chose to either eat at the house or go out to eat instead of eating at the resort. I would recommend this resort to everyone. I would love to stay here every time I go to Orlando. The resort is so large, quiet, and away from the busy roads near Disney.

Also we called for the refreshment cart about 3 times and no one came....told the pro-shop and they really didn't seem too upset - considering the other options I have for golf courses, they should step up their service in the golf department. I saw a decline in the course condition from 2007. The Disney courses were amazing (Magnolia and Osprey Ridge) Championsgate was in ok shape too but they gave us 30 dollars to use for lunch or in the pro-shop so that kind of made up for it.

The property itself and the accomodation is nothing short of spectacular. The condos are beautiful and the golf courses, pools, waterpark, and other amenities are pretty much as good as it gets. I find it hard to believe anyone could be disappointed with the accomodation or the facilities. Everything is first class. The golf courses are challenging and expensive ($165 per round) so I wouldn't recommend you go to Reunion for a golf vacation unless you are a fairly regular golfer and are prepared to part with some coin. There are 3 beautifully manicured courses and full clubhouse and practice facilities right on site. Our group consisting of two couples enjoyed the Palmer (Legacy) and Watson (Independence) courses the most. They were fair tests of golf and the tee blocks were friendly to the ladies and all handicap levels. The Nicklaus (Tradition) course has just been completed and we found it to be a bit too diffcult. There are fairway traps everywhere and the sand has the soft texture you expect to find in greenside bunkers so it is extremely tough to advance the ball. My 1 handicap buddy only managed to shoot 84 ! I suspect the Nicklaus course will be more enjoyable once the course matures a bit. Some of the other reviewers (and Ginn) rave about the customer service. I must be honest and say we didn't find it to be anything exceptional. For example, we didn't have a great check in experience. We arrived in the morning and completed a pre-check in and then hung out at the pool for the day. We were advised our unit would be ready by 4pm at the latest and it wasn't. Also, we booked 4 months in advance and had arranged to be in the same complex as our friends and they were not going to deliver on that either. They proceeded to put us in two different complexes. We finally got our accomodation at about 5:30pm in the same condo complex but only after insisting that we speak to the Manager. I still can't figure out why they fumbled the check-in because there were clearly a number of vacant units in our complex. We also found the food and drink service at the pool areas to be very slow. On the positive side, there is no tipping which makes it easy and there are a number of nice touches throughout the resort such as club cleaning, golf club storage, doormen, shuttles to your vehicle, security, etc. The service in the clubhouse restaurant, Eleven (rooftop bar) and pro shop was fine. It is worthy to mention that the resort is gated and Ginn security people and lifeguards always seem to be around. As such, if you are there with your children you will feel comfortable allowing them to go off to the waterpark while you go golfing, etc. Overall, we really enjoyed our stay at the spectacular Ginn Reunion Resort and we would not hesitate to recommend it to friends and colleagues.

Our party, which included, 4 adults, 2 three year old boys, and 1 infant stayed in a 3 bedroom villa in Seven Eagles from 12/3 \u2013 12/10. Nearly everything was perfect with our stay. We were walking distance to Seven Eagles pool and the club house for the Legacy and Independence courses. The accommodations, recreation facilities, customer service, and value were unmatched, not to mention the immaculate condition of the Legacy and Independence courses. I personally liked the no cash no tip policy (you use your guest card only), though I did see one semi-negative review that mentioned they didn\u2019t like this approach. The incidental cost can add up quickly but you can track them daily if you are worried about your budget, or you could also stay at a Motel 6, eat at McDonalds, and play municipal golf courses if you are worried about the money. We opted to rent a car because we had young children but we did not need it other than to go to the grocery store located about 1.5 miles away. Within the resort, prompt shuttle service was provided if we didn\u2019t feel like walking. We never waited more than 10 min for a ride in one of their sweet Mercedes R350s. To be fair I did say nearly perfect as there were two things that could have been improved. We arranged to be picked up at the airport through the resort weeks in advance of our stay. However, the contracted transportation service messed up the pickup date. This resulted in a delay in our pickup by about 1.5 hours. In turn, Ginn did not charge us ($110.00/11 person van) for that transportation. We also checked into our accommodations 5 hours before the standard check in time so all in all we were unhappy, even with the SNAFU. The only other thing was that the pool kitchen closed a couple of hours early on Friday night without warning to free up staff for the prime rib buffet at the club house, the bar was open but no food. Golf; Jack\u2019s course, The Tradition, is long with very small greens (can you say Pebble Beach). It was a fair and challenging. The immature or lack of landscaping as compared to the other two courses are obvious but the course condition was outstanding. In addition, the lack of a clubhouse, abundant home constructions going on around the course did detract from the overall experience. Give it a year and I\u2019m sure the missing details will be in place. It is the hardest of the three, but it\u2019s classic Jack. You can stand on the tee box and see how you are supposed to play the hole, the bailouts and risky shots are there if you want them. Palmer\u2019s course, The Legacy, and Watson\u2019s course, The Independence, are set within the main resort area. The clubhouse is centrally located near the main building. These courses are more mature and the landscaping, course condition, and surrounding homes are immaculate. The Palmer course is the easiest of the three but still challenging. The Watson course is tricky and probably needs to be played a few times before you understand where your supposed to hit the ball. The clubhouse is bright and friendly. It\u2019s the only place that serves breakfast so it\u2019s the main gathering point for all of the hungry hackers and families alike. The (non-breakfast) menu is an interesting mix with chili dogs, home made sweet potato chips with gorgonzola sauce, prime rib, burgers, and killer hash browns. The practice facilities are nice but nothing special. There is plenty of room with a couple of putting greens, chipping and sand practice green, and a double sided driving range. Water Park; The water park is right there on property. It\u2019s a perfect spot for the kiddies. They had lifeguards at every bend, the kids area was cool, and the food was great. Try the corn dog nuggets. Spa, I didn\u2019t go myself but my wife liked it very much. She got a pedicure, massage, and facial. I got golf.

We arrived late after traveling all day with my 3 children. I had booked a 3 bedroom home with a pool. When I arrived, I was told I did not book a room with a pool. They were rude and would not give me what I booked, after about an hour of going back and forth with the front desk I finally just asked them to get me a place since we were tired and hungry. They put me in a 4 bedroom house with a cold pool, in the middle of a field with a bunch of other houses and no landscaping. I thought it was at the rate I booked but found out the next day I was being charged a lot more and ended up paying almost 100 more per night. I called the general manager, he told me he would look into, he called me back while we were at Disney, I called him back and he left town for the week. But let me tell you what others have not about this resort: 1. The Villas and homes are privately owned and managed by the developer. The resort is spread out and you have to get into your car and drive to pool, or any other places. 2. This is not a resort where you have services like at most resorts, They have a pool and a lazy river that are nice but don't expect any amenities you would find by a pool at the Ritz or any other resort, they do not have water but charge 3.50 for a bottle, they do have activities for children, but they charge a lot for them, and the pool is located far from your room. 3. This resort is about 20 minutes on busy highway from Disney. 4. This is a golf community, most people come for golf. the course does not look as nice as the photos make it look. 5. Food is expensive and drinks even more $$$$ 6. They like to nickle and dime you to death. 7. The service is poor and the staff is unfriendly. 8. Beware when choosing this location for your next Disney or Orlando vacation. There are a lot of options and rooms available in the Orlando area. Try JW Marriott, they have a nice lazy river and the service is unbelievable. We did leave the resort four days early, They had a warning about the water in the binder about the resort, the warning said you had to boil water before you drink it. They would not serve water at the pools to us, you had to purchase bottled water. I feel the management and front desk were rude and just wanted to overcharge me for my stay. I spoke to Preferred Hotels and they said the rate I had would not be in the system anymore because it was a special rate and would be out of the computer system when I checked in. Orlando has taken for granted the fact that tourism is there only trade and has forgotten how to treat their visitors. It is crowded at the theme parks and Disney is not as friendly as a few years ago. Its such an expensive trip and for a resort not to honor a reservation that was given to a traveler is unacceptable. The other reviews which I read prior to choosing this resort said they loved this resort. I have been to a lot of Preferred Hotels and I'm not sure why they accepted this one to there list. I would have to say it was a very poor place to take children and try to have a vacation.

Even the bananas and grapes were disgusting and the yogurt was warm. They did credit the entire grocery order. The next day my husband found a maxi pad rapper under the sheets. I read one review that stated there were tons of bugs everyhwere and as I arrived I was thinking to myself, well this is Florida, and it is summertime, it's to be expected. But I didn't expect giant 2 inch beetles to be swimming toward me in the hot tub I was trying to relax in. Disgusted, I left, and the next day my 12 year old son said he had to leave the hot tub because a huge frog was swimming in it. Because it was so hot and I was determined to try the pool (this is the pool at Heritage Crossing) I tried again and the third day there was a gigantic beetle in the pool. I gave up trying to use the pool at Heritage Crossing and we (the whole family) really enjoyed the waterpark. The waterpark was very relaxing and I could easily stay there all day. You do have to wait about 30-45 minutes for drinks/food so if you think you're going to be hungry just order ahead of time. Or you can just walk up to the bar and get drinks. However, on one of the days we went to the waterpark I ordered a Cool Breeze, there were 3 employees behind the bar and not one of them knew how to make it. I mean, the drink did get made, the guy had to look on the menu to get the ingredients, he left off the best part (the pineapple)...it was just a little weird. Other than that, overall it is a nice resort and we did have a great time. These complaints, (other than the food spoiling) are relatively minor, (unless you really get freaked out by gigantic bugs swimming around you), and I actually do recommend giving the place a try. The staff was very nice and accommodating. We did 5 parks in 8 days and really weren't there a whole lot. I am netural right now on whether or not I would stay there again (as we do plan on returning to Orlando for a 2 week stay). I do think it's worth trying once. Tip* If you are going to Universal Studios/Islands of Adventure I think it i definately worth the extra money for the Express Pass. We got on every ride with virtually no wait and we went on July 3rd and 4th.", "Date": "July 9, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bloomington, IL", "Title": "\u201cFantastic!!!!!!\u201d", "Author": "blondiekdf", "ReviewID": "UR8071885", "Content": "Once you stay here, you will not want to stay anywhere else!

We are a couple in our early 30s (no kids). We had no problem getting into the gated community (the owner had given our details to the security people). The house was absolutely gorgeous - 4 bedrooms, 5.5 baths. Big living room, seperate sitting and dining rooms, gourmet kitchen, games room with pool table and games console, and some exercise equipment (treadmill, bike and cross-trainer) in the garage. There was also free wireless internet access and a little \"computer cupboard\" too. The pool and hot tub were gorgeous - both were \"infinity\". The pool is quite small, but has a beautiful view of the golf couse. The whole house is decorated and furnished in very good taste and it provided a luxurious and peaceful retreat from the hustle and bustle of Disney and the rest of Orlando. We only stayed there for four nights, but did get a chance to use the \"water park\" which was very quiet and enjoyable - just floating around on the lazy river. I enjoyed some early morning jogging around the golf courses - absolutely beautiful. Infact the whole community is really gorgeous. If you like proper golf (we only play miniature golf!), it must be an amazing to play there. We had a great time and are booked to stay in the same villa with the same owner again this September, this time for a week. Hopefully we will have more time to check out the community's other facilities (like the bars and restaurants). Reunion is quite an expensive place to stay, but that is a reflection of the quality of the resort. I would recommend renting directly from an owner - then you know exactly what you are getting and they will give you a good price.", "Date": "June 30, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington DC, District of Columbia", "Title": "\u201cAbsolutely perfect!!!!\u201d", "Author": "FishGurrl", "ReviewID": "UR8020555", "Content": "Just returned from Reunion and had a wonderful experience. Arrived way before check in at 1:30 and there was no problem being escorted immediately to our villa. Staff was extremely helpful and pleasant. What a gorgeous place! Booked a 3 bedroom villa that looked like a model home inside. Beautifully decorated and appointed, it was just gorgeous. And so spacious! My two boys each had their own rooms and bathroom and there was even an office for my husband to work on his laptop. The master bedroom was huge and a gigantic walk-in closet, it's own balcony and a master bath the size of most bedrooms. Our villa looked out over the golf course and the villa was extremely quiet. I didn't hear any noises from outside people or otherwise. Very soundly built. Utilized the water park one afternoon and it was awesome too. The kids loved it. Didn't notice any bugs at all. Not one. It was only about 10 minutes driving time to Disney too which is a plus. There are security guards around the clock at all the entrances which is really nice. Won't even think of staying anywhere else after this visit!
