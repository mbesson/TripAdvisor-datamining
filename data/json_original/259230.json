The bad news is that the room was awful. It smelt mouldy, the curtains did also have a layer of mould along the bottom of them. There was a fan but no aircon, the room was dirty and cramped - it had a random selection of furniture in that looked like it came out of a charity shop, there was a dining room table but no wardrobe or dawers just a hanging rail and about 3 large chairs with a bed pushed up against the wall with thick blankets on (it was the middle of summer!), the carpet thin and lumpy, I tripped over the wrinkles in the carpet most mornings! The room was at the front corner of the building next to the traffic lights which beeped all night and kept us awake. I have stayed in nicer hostels, and this was like a hostel rather than a hotel. There were plently of showers and toilets however because they were shared people did make a complete mess in them, and the aroma was pretty pungent if you didn't get up early (which we did after day 1 for this reason!) The shower head in one room fell onto my fiances head and the tap in another fell off in my hand, the base of the bed also came apart one night and we had to put it back together - we did joke that we were staying in Fawlty Towers! The positives: 1. It was cheap in a very expensive area 2. They have a luggage room so let us store luggage there on our first and last days. 3. There is a washing machine and dryer (watch out for the temperature on the dryer, don't set too hot - I managed to shrink all our socks, I didn't even know this was possible!) 4. There was a fridge in the room (had to clean it with face wipes as it was really dirty however!) If they were to invest some money in doing up the rooms then it could be very pleasant but as it is it's tired and grubby and whilst cheap is not a particularly pleasant place to stay. They offer breakfast for a fee but we didn't think it looked worth it, dry cereal, toast and juice - if you turn left at the (noisy!) traffic lights and walk up the hill there is a great little coffee shop that does breakfast wraps, eggs benedict, bacon rolls and a great flat white fairly cheaply (for the area - everything is expensive so relatively cheap!). If I were to go again I'd probably plump for the nearby Novotel and pay the extra as although we weren't expecting luxury we were expecting it to smell nice, be clean and quiet which it wasn't, so not a great start to our first visit to Oz; out of the six weeks this was the worst place we stayed (unfortunately for 4 nights too!).

There were dozens of restaurants, the aquarium, water taxis, IMAX, Maritime Museum all within 5 minutes walk. After 5 hours of sightseeing we returned to the hotel to check in...the sad little awning on the door does invoke a sense of \"youth hostel\" from my early days of traveling, and the staircase once inside likes to creak loudly (and goes up and up forever), but the rooms had sinks and refrigerators so we were able to shop at the \"Woolies\" (woolworth's) and have food in our rooms. The rooms varied dramatically, but most had second hand tables and older tv's...however, we were in Australia to see Australia, not watch television or be pampered in our rooms. The staff was friendly and very willing to assist with taxis, directions and advice. We fell in love with Darling Harbour and Sydney, and we couldn't have afforded to stay so close to the harbour anywhere else.
