Staff is very kind, they welcomed us very kindly with some te, they speak a good english, they helped us with all the info we needed. Breakfast is good, they even make express omelet, they have sweet and salt, maybe there isnt just a big variety of food, but it is ok. They have wi-fi, even if it is not sooo fast, but i travel a lot, and i can tell you it was one of the faster i've ever tested among all the hotels.

The staffs were so kind and greeting and make us to feel as a very special guest. Although some of them do not speak English but they really tried to make a pleasant time for us. Very kind receptions helped us to spend a happy time in enjoyable places in Istanbul by offering us tours in some great neighborhoods. We stayed in the suite with the view of sultan ahmet mosque. Accessories where well arranged and the room\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s environment was warm and beautiful. The trace is surprisingly big and besides the wonderful view of sultan ahmet mosque in the night, though the weather was a little cold we could not resist to enjoy the great balcony. Unexpectedly the suite was much more appreciable than what they have defined in their site. If you are looking for a hotel with a high level of cleanness, in my opinion you may have no choice, but to select seraglio. We checked the suite, buffet and restaurant very carefully but any kind of dirtiness didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bother us. The staffs are so willing to help and if you need something they would make it ready as soon as possible. The breakfast buffet is so delicious and very diverse. Being served with such a pleasant meal, by smiling chef made our days. You would have few choices with the food in hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s restaurant, especially if you were vegetarian, but the food quality is stunning. The neighborhood is filled with restaurants, tee houses and this makes that area memorable. Seraglio hotel has located in the middle of the ancient area of Istanbul so you can reach to 90% of the historical places in ten minutes. Walking to The blue mosque takes at last 5 minutes and there you can use public transportations, which costs very fair in Istanbul. We really enjoyed low price public transportation so near the hotel. As the hotel is only two years old, the cabs from taksim region do not know the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s address very well, and we were lost one night. But the great accessibility to the public transportations covers this problem. We spent our romantic vacation in the lovely seraglio hotel. Thanks to the best services there was no problem with the hotel to make us a little bit less happier, indeed made this trip the most memorable trip of our life. We recommend every young couple, if they wanna have comfortable, happy and loving moments in their vacation just try seraglio hotel.", "Date": "February 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne, Australia", "Title": "\u201cFantastic service and great location\u201d", "Author": "pinaryilmaz", "ReviewID": "UR124609827", "Content": "We stayed close to 14 days at this hotel and I would recommend this hotel to anyone who is visiting Istanbul.

On arrival and after checking in we were each treated to a cup of Turkish coffee and given a comprehensive briefing of the locality, recommended restaurants and advised of the best tours to be had in Istanbul. Our room, on the first floor, was absolutely charming; a huge room, with floor to ceiling windows and doors onto a lovely balcony with table and chairs overlooking the little courtyard, where we spent early mornings and evenings planning our sightseeing in this amazing city. Breakfast was perfect and set us up for 4 days of relentless exploring - the omelettes were wonderful! The location of the hotel was perfect - I am so glad that we didn't stay in Beyoglu as a lot of people recommended. As lively and interesting as it was, nothing could compare with the old city and it's superb restaurants and peaceful evening atmosphere. We took advantage of the complimentary tea and cakes late afternoon in the bistro part of the hotel.

Sultanahmet is where most of the really big tourist attractions are so it is also where you will be bumping into hundreds of tourists. It is crowded, food is substandard and there is a hotel about every 2 feet. If you do opt for one of the terraces, be expected to pay a lot for very little quality. Since I have been to Istanbul before, my decision would be (next time) to stay on the other side of town where there are much more interesting going out places and where you actually have a chance to meet people from Istanbul. If you have never been here before, then okay you may wish to stay here but then do get on the tram and head to the other areas of Istanbul to go out as this side of town is a total rip off and the food (almost without exception) is not of good quality and much more expensive. But if you do opt to stay here, this hotel is a nice choice. It is reasonable, comparatively. We payed \u00e2\u201a\u00ac119 a night for what is a standard room, which was fine. Not huge rooms but do able. There is a good bathroom, a wardrobe, a safe and a mini bar. There is free wi fi and a computer to use in the lobby if you don't bring yours. Breakfast is fine, served in the basement or you can take out to the cafe which is open. There is no terrace but you can find plenty of places that have one to get the view. Staff are very friendly. They offer a free transfer (one way) to their hotel if you are staying 2 or 3 nights. We were met but waited a bit to leave. I think next time, we would just do a taxi. It is only between 35-55 turkish lira (divide by 4 for Euro and a little over 5 for US dollars) so not much. Ride to hotel was about 30-40 minutes. Only complaint about hotel when we went was a bit of noise. They are doing construction on hotel across the road and they did it at really bad hours (early and late). Finally, one tip. If you are departing internationally, check in on line and print your boarding pass when you leave. Ataturk airport is a zoo at almost anytime in the international departures and if you need to check in you MUST give yourself at least 2.5 hours there. There are multiple security checks and the check in lines are long. Whereas if you check in on line, then you will reduce your time greatly (there were only 2 people in line in front). it is only one counter, so you will need to look.

Stumbled upon them on a web search by chance, which ended up being the proverbial cherry on our fantastic turkey vacation. Right from the time we arrived at Seraglio (from a rather unpleasant immigration experience) at the Attaturk Airport, we were taken care of fabulously by the extremely polite & thoughtful staff. Upon asking if we were up for iton arrival, the front desk explained the geographical spread of Turkey on a map, pointing out the key attractions and must try restaurants. We were even provided a proper handout of opening/closing timings of key attractions along with the days they were closed, which came in very handy. The hotel is located somewhat close to the main attractions of Old Istanbul, The Blue Mosque & Hagia Sofia. There is, however, a bit of an uphill walk to both of these [roughly 5 minutes] so it didnt matter much to us [note: make sure you pack comfortable walking shoes before coming to Istanbul! Slippers/FlipFlops will literally kill you!] . The nearest tram station is also roughly 5-7 minutes away, from where you can go almost anywhere in Istanbul. The room was clean & very functional, with a spacious wardrobe, safe & mini bar. Having requested a smoking room, we had an adjoining balcony for smoking which kept the room smelling of stale cigarettes. The bathroom was immaculately pristine and almost looked brand new, much to our joy! Though we didnt eat much on the hotel premises during the day, the breakfast (inclusive in the room rate) was fantastic, with a wide selection of cereals, fruits, hot and cold drinks as well as an egg station. Seraglio also upped the game by offering free evening tea and snacks from 5:00pm to 7:00pm to all its guests, which we availed when we werent out exploring the city. However, I feel the strongest point of Seraglio is its staff. Having travelled quite a bit including to the far east which is famed for its hospitality, I have never experienced the kind of service that we experienced at our stay at Seraglio. Kenan & Celal at the front desk & the housekeeping & bistro staff went out of their way to make sure we were taken care of, with their recommendations of restaurants, providing directions to obscure places, loaning us travel guidebooks for the day, referring us to travel agents for exploring trips to cappadocia & pamukale, arranging airport transfers etc etc. In short, Seraglio probably ranks as one of the best hotels we've ever stayed at.

The bathroom was a good size with a large shower. The air-conditioning worked well and overall the staff was nice. Free wifi. The ok: The location is in a very touristy area, which i thought would be good and may be good for some. But maybe because it's a touristy area of maybe because it's Istanbul, every shop owner and restaurant waiter haggles with you and borderline harasses you wherever you walk in the area. The location is quite close to the Hagia Sofia, Cistern, Topkapi and Blue mosque but you could take a cab/tram there from somewhere else for a day and sightsee and then spend the rest of your time in the city elsewhere. The bad: Hard to put my finger on. I think everyone meant well at the hotel but after a while I just got the feeling that everything they told me was wrong. Here are some examples. My first night I asked the gentleman at the desk to make a dinner reservation for me at 10 PM, which he told me was too late. I said that I didn't realize people ate so early in Istanbul and he said that it was not healthy to eat late and made the reservation for 9. Later, when taking a cab to the restaurant, I asked for the address to be written down for me. A different gentleman assured me that he told the cab driver and the cab driver knew exactly where the restaurant was and everything was taken care of so there was no need to write anything down. Well the cab driver dropped us in the wrong place and, despite searching and asking directions (using only the restaurant name) for 30 minutes, we gave up. Ok, I wasn't happy but let it go because mistakes happen. The same day I asked for laundry to be sent. I was told it would be ready the next day. It wasn't, and came back the following day right before I had to leave. When the gentleman at the desk gave it to me, he said, \"it has nothing to do with me.\" I thought this was a rather strange yet inappropriate response. When I asked if the payment could be paid with credit card, he said no and again repeated, \"it has nothing to do with me.\" Maybe it was a language or a cultural thing, but overall all of this added up and left a bad taste in my mouth.

The prayer calls from the blue mosque is heard very clearly (first call at 6 in the morning) but this is hard to avoid if you want to live in the old town since there are mosques all over the place and to me just added to the atmosphere!

The complimentary afternoon tea with home made cookies is a nice touch. The hotels restaurant was clean but need more Turkish dishes (now more than half the menu is european turist food). The only negative things I can say about the hotell is the limited number of English language TV-channels (but who cares for TV in Istanbul anyhow!) and that one of the people in the staff recomended the nearby \"fish house\" that turned out to be a complete tourist trap with very inflated prices - avoid to all cost if you stay here - a better choice is for instance \"Ocean's Seven Restaurant\" (not located in the hotel with the same name but on a nearby street).", "Date": "April 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wimberley, Texas", "Title": "\u201cHelpful, friendly staff\u201d", "Author": "llr43", "ReviewID": "UR104960381", "Content": "We were able to get the Blue Mosque room for our first two nights in Istanbul as it was booked the rest of our stay.

We switched to a delux double room, which was really nice with three sets of glass doors and its own outside terrace over a small courtyard. A similar room, and a much better bargain. The hotel had a car service pick us up at the airport free of charge as we were staying at least four days. On departure, they arranged the same service for a 25 Euro trip to Ataturk Airport. On arrival at the hotel, the owner provided us with tea and a rundown on Istanbul sights, recommendations and a map. Hotel Seraglio is a 3-5 minute walk to the Blue Mosque. There are many, many restaurants in the neighborhood, as well as some small grocery shops. The hotel has a bistro for basics and a limited menu. Breakfasts in the hotel breakfast room were very good, with a chef available for omelets on request. The usual hotel efficiency showed in breakfast as tables immediately were cleared and we never saw anyone have to wait for a table. The hotel was kept very clean and both our bedrooms had ample cabinets for hanging clothes and clothes storage. As the hotel was convenient to the tram, we used it often. The tram ticket machines were a good way to break bills for change, 20 lira bills or smaller. On the owner's recommended list was Hamdi Restaurant, across the street from Eminonu, the major boat docks. The lamb and kebobs were excellent; the view wonderful; the service good, although a little slow in providing the bill. Our best meal in Istanbul, however, was two blocks from the hotel. Akbiyik Fish House brought their fish to the table and we chose the second scariest-looking offering, the scorpion fish. It was prepared perfectly, was superbly moist, spicy and tasty. Unforgettable. At departure, the hotel again had the car service pick us up and driver Ali Ekber Bakir of instanbulairporttransfer was excellent.

The staff turned on the hammam in the morning, so it was nice and hot for our arrival. We were exhausted after the trip, but after a few minutes lying on the marble benches, followed by a thorough wash and scrub, we were ready to face the world again! We would do hammam every night and it was wonderful, except for one little issue: we were so looking forward to relaxing on the heated benches that we were cutting our Istanbul sightseeing short for yet more time in our room :) The room itself was large and beautiful with high ceilings, new furniture, good choice of pillows, comfortable bed, big LCD TV with a good choice of sat channels, a small safe, mini-bar, good heating/a/c unit, fast WiFi, etc. One thing that might be a nuisance for a light sleeper in a busier season is lack of noise insulation of windows and the door. Most rooms look out onto houses on the other side of the street, but we overheard someone telling that the view from the rooms on the top floor is just magnificent (Blue Mosque or Marmara Sea). The entire hotel has interesting compositions throughout, so the breakfast area looks very pleasant. Breakfast buffet was very good: a lot of choices both for Turkish breakfast (5-6 types of cheese, 2 types of olives, white, grey, marble, brown bread, etc) and traditional English, including eggs any type (incl. omelette) made to order. Oh, and don't forget cheese, chocolate crepes and strawberry, chocolate heart-shaped pancakes :) Freshly squeezed juice was 2 EUR extra. Oh, don't forget that they have tea time every evening in their bistro with free tea, coffee, and various tasty sweets.

The rear of the hotel faces a quiet street where one can sit in the open fronted caf\u00c3\u00a9 enjoying mezes with drinks before, after or instead of sight-seeing. The Sultanahmet section of Istanbul, named for the Sultan Ahmet who built the Blue Mosque, is the center of the Old Istanbul. Travelers arriving on the Orient Express referred to it as \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcStamboul\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 (e.g., Graham Green\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Stamboul Train\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd). The Seraglio is situated here amongst other small boutique hotels with a sprinkling of cafes and shops giving it a quiet urban neighborhood appeal. A short stroll takes you to many of the remarkable historical sights: the Aya Sofya, Blue Mosque, Byzantine Hippodrome, Basilica Cistern and the Topkai Palace where Peter Ustinov comically attempts to steal the Sultan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s emerald in the 1964 eponymous movie. A few more minutes takes you to the Grand Bazaar or either of two old hammams we visited where you can have your travel cares steamed and scrubbed away. Kenan Saicelik, whose surname means \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcyellow steel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, is a man of steel in response to all requests. He made suggestions for tours, he booked our tours, he called airlines, he arranged our airport transfers, he told us when to go or not to go to various sights AND he saved our wine for us when we left it in our room fridge during a three day excursion. Kenan and his colleagues are helpful, courteous and a large part of the reason the Seraglio is a grand accommodation in Old Stamboul.", "Date": "October 20, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Istanbul, Turkey", "Title": "\u201cFriendly\u201d", "Author": "ellyp41", "ReviewID": "UR84176432", "Content": "We stayed at hotel Seraglio for a week.

It's also in a great area for dinner - with several quaint restaurants on cobble-stone streets -- although beware of tourist restaurants that hike up the prices and are filled with americans with cameras. We ate at a local \"Meat House\", and despite its name was delicious and filled with locals. The service in the hotel was great - they let us check in before 10am and even gave us turkish coffee while we waited for our room to be ready.

The room was also very spacious, light, modern and very clean. Breakfast was very good and they even have tea time for all the guests every evening where you are served free tea and cakes! The hotel is also the setting for a lovely bar where you can enjoy al fresco dining and some water pipe smoking. Don't bother looking any further for a hotel .. Book Hotel Seraglio now! .. you will not be disappointed. We intend to come back to Istanbul again in the future and we will certainly stay here. Only small issue was the quality of satellite TV channels which were not so good as many of the channels do not work, however who cares about TV when you are in such a magnificient city that has so much to offer.

We hope you remain the same in years to come. keep up the good work as it is really appreciated by your guests.
