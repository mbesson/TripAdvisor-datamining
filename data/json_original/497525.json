You LOVE the banging noise of heavy construction, early in the morning, even on Sunday. Have I got a hotel for you!! It's a pity that unworkable Wi-Fi and the ongoing construction across the street make the experience at Hotel dei Congressi so bad. The rooms are oldish but in very good upkeep, clean, pretty large for Rome, and well-lit (also unusual these days.) The restaurant is OK, breakfast good, staff friendliness so-so (again not bad for Rome). Location is far away from the tourist places but very easy to reach by Metro, balance good deal vs. scarce local amenities. But the Internet access is so bad it really spoils the experience.", "Date": "October 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles", "Title": "\u201cDefinitely not 4 star\u201d", "Author": "JohnLCrain", "ReviewID": "UR119348108", "Content": "The hotels rooms are very dated.

Breakfast was fine with a typical continental range, fresh coffee. I had dinner in the hotel and chose the set 4 course menu for \u20ac30 which I thought was value for money, the food was very good. Bed comfortable enough for me but may find the mattress too hard. Free WiFi but coverage intermittent.

It's just 5 minutes walking from the Metro EUR Fermi station but just near the station is an awful flea market ...Very very annoying.. The hotel itself is an old building with probably 15-20 year old furniture but it looks OK . We were allowed to check-in early at about 9:30 and we were very happy with it. Our room was large and clean with an 22'' LCD TV. Bathroom was clean as well. Probably the best thing is the free WI-FI connection. The breakfast was above average for Italy and the espresso is included. Staff was helpful, especially the night bartender.", "Date": "April 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ireland", "Title": "\u201cGood hotel\u201d", "Author": "Ataga", "ReviewID": "UR83683158", "Content": "I've stayed in this hotel just for one night but I was happy with it. It's not in the city centre and you need to take a subway ( by the way one day travel card for subway cost 4e) but it only takes about 20 minutes to get there and than about 3-5 minutes to walk to the hotel from the subway station = really easy. The hotel is still facing a building site so it might be a bit noisy in the morning unless you have the room on the other site of the hotel I guess. My room was big, clean - the only thing I miss were the tea/coffe facilities in room (ok not each hotel have them) and it was easy to get the tea in the hotel bar - it cost 2.5E there. In the bathroom there were 2 small \"kits\" one with with \"brush\" to clean your shoes and the second one was with the hair band, few pads to remove your make up, small emery board and \"sticks\" to clean your ears - really cool. I arrived early - before check in time but i could left my luggage there and go sightseeing. And I was really, rally late for the breafkast but still was able to have it: there was bread, cakes, some ham, yellow cheese, white cheese, jams, joghurts - it was good enough for me.", "Date": "October 16, 2010"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Dei Congressi", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187791-d497525-Reviews-Hotel_Dei_Congressi-Rome_Lazio.html", "Price": "$135 - $249*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Viale Shakespeare 29</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">00144</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Rome</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Italy</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "497525", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/c3/fa/ac/hotel-dei-congressi.jpg"}}
