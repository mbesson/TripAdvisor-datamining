We had an excellent experience at the resort. Overall the resort is spectacular - combining a bit of a mangrove with the beach. We have been in similar resorts before - but they were not kept at the same standards. The green areas were perfectly \"manicured\" and everything was very clean. There are lots of birds and animals - but only outside the rooms - which was not the case in the other resorts we have visited before. The room was amazing, very clean and with a comfortable bed. It was very nice to get a bottle of tequila upon arrival. The sun bed on top of the room was also a great asset. Service was great as well, both related to the room, at the restaurants and also the pools. We were really pampered with small treats every 30 min, whenever at the beach or at the pool. The distance between the room and other buildings was not big - you could walk everywhere - the only longer distance was to the beach but we used a lot the golf carts for this. We took some trips out of the resort, and the concierge was extremely helpful in arranging everything for us. I give the resort almost 5 starts. The only things that kept the resort from getting a perfect 5 for me were the beach (too small) and the internet (too slow).", "Date": "March 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "CT", "Title": "\u201cthey do a great job\u201d", "Author": "rjb826", "ReviewID": "UR126354886", "Content": "the facility is beautiful, the service tries very hard, they dont get it right 100% of the time but it is not for lack of effort. they make you feel at home and everything there is top notch", "Date": "March 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles", "Title": "\u201cSpectaculer even when we didn't pick the place.\u201d", "Author": "David W", "ReviewID": "UR125872028", "Content": "Me and my wife were guests of a client, so we didn't pick the place, nor were we paying or expecting any extra service.

Even seasoned travelers will be blown away!\u201d", "Author": "PeacefulOdyssey", "ReviewID": "UR125774455", "Content": "We haven't found anything yet so close to the USA that compares. We already knew that it is one of the top resorts in the world, selected as Mexico & Central America's Leading Luxury Resort for 2011 and 2010 by World Travel Awards. Then, the day after we returned from what we knew was the most romantic trip of our lives, we learned that Rosewood was selected by Gayot as one of the world\u2019s 10 most romantic hotels. The fabulous memories came flooding back! If you like the ocean, like nature, like luxury, and love to be pampered, this is the place. Whether it's a long weekend (it's so easy to get to) or a longer, relaxed vacation, the Rosewood Mayakoba will not disappoint. Some high end resorts are a bit too stuffy for our taste, but Rosewood is the essence of beach casual. There's no big, grand lobby here; there's no big building, there's only beautiful small, individual buildings in harmony with nature (the lagoon with a boat dock on one side of the suite, the beach on the other side, and the mangrove). You can even catch a boat from your suite to elsewhere in the resort. We have been to many 5 and 6 star resorts, and this is our favorite. It's so close, so comfortable and so wonderful in every way. The location is terrific; right near Playa del Carmen, a town that feels like a little bit of Europe in Mexico. Although we loved going into town for the great restaurants and nightlife, it's hard to leave Rosewood, the restaurants are so good. The best of both worlds! You get your own personal butler with each suite. At first, we were a bit apprehensive: why do we need a butler? But they are so kind and sensitive about your privacy, we grew to really appreciate this perk. Whether it's an extra Nespresso, a DVD, unpacking service, running a warm bath, information or whatever, they are the best. The rooms are also amazing. You definitely can't call these standard hotel rooms. The suites all have interesting architecture, materials, and decor. No expense was sparred to create a luxurious environment in harmony with nature. The spa is another ah-ha moment; really cool, on it's own little island. You really feel safe and secure here. I guess that's why you always see celebrities and VIP's there, but beware, you may not recognize them in a tee shirt, shades and a baseball cap; it works for them too. One very cool thing about Rosewood Mayakoba is that it's within the magnificent development of Mayakoba. It's not just one resort by itself. The developers, OHL of Spain, have created a high end development including the Fairmont Resort and Banyon Tree Resort. They are all connected by a world class golf course (just hosted the PGA) and waterways (lagoons) as well as the beach. The lagoons were created from the natural cenotes in the area. We've never seen anything like it! You can golf cart around or take a boat ride; there's bikes too. This allows you to visit the other resorts for lunch, dinner, spa or whatever without ever leaving the development. It's really nice to be able to check out the other resorts without leaving the safety and comfort of Mayakoba. That's unique. In summary, if you're looking for true luxury in a casual beach setting that's a hop, skip and jump away, you definitely ought to check out Rosewood Mayakoba. It is truly a unique experience combining nature with all of the modern conveniences. You won't regret it!", "Date": "March 7, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dallas, Texas", "Title": "\u201cRelaxing - great experience; incredible service\u201d", "Author": "Jim N", "ReviewID": "UR125729771", "Content": "We have stayed in several Rosewood hotels and they are uniformly excellent.

Check out the submissions featuring the Esencia and Maroma Orient Express. More to come so stay tuned. The Mayakoba development is situated about 10 km north of Playa del Carmen. It is a large resort property built among mangroves, forest, luxury golf courses and a beautiful beach that seems to never end. The large Mayakoba entrance is well marked and you will recognize it by the wide white wall structure housing a security booth and a guard screening entries into the property. Mayakoba is home to two of the most beautiful hotels on the Mayan Riviera: the Rosewood and the Banyan Tree. The Mayakoba beach, stretched in front of a few resorts, is a wonderful long beach with pure white sand and great surf. Beach walking, shell hunting (find them but leave them on the beach) or a swim (if it's calm) are fun to do after breakfast at one of these lovely luxury hotels. Once through the Mayakoba gate turn left and watch for the small Rosewood sign directing you to a narrow lane winding through the dense but manicured forest ending at the reception. Leave your car with the valet and let them know you have come for breakfast. There is no charge for parking but leave gratuities when they bring back your vehicle upon departure. Rosewood The Rosewood is a sister resort to Las Ventanas al Paraiso (Windows to Paradise) in Cabo San Lucas and is every bit as glamorous. The hotel is situated around winding lagoons among mangroves and an electric powered boat will deliver you to your individual suite on the beautifully landscaped property. Sometimes a little crocodile can be viewed sunning itself on the edge of the water, observing the scene. Nothing to worry about though. The lagoons are regularly monitored for wildlife in this beautiful natural ecosystem and when necessary, the little crocs are moved to another, more remote location. Look out for special fowl that call the mangrove home. The Rosewood is nestled in this natural setting seemingly without disturbing it, blending nature and structure in perfect harmony. The open air architecture merging stone, glass, water and air, the large pots filled with blossoming bougainvilleas, giant cactuses and the gorgeous landscape make this place a true paradise. Reservations are not required for breakfast but I recommend calling anyway to avoid surprises and it makes it easier to get through the entrance gate. The security guards are sometimes reluctant to let you through without reservations but just talk them through it. If you are visiting between Christmas and New Year\u2019s the hotel may not accept outside guests. Breakfast is served in Casa de Lago, set near the front lagoon and main pool. You could sit inside but the covered porch is where we like to settle for breakfast. A beautiful buffet is set out inside with all the breakfast side offerings, from fruits to cereals, yogurts, pastries and cheeses, but you choose your main breakfast dish from a menu (included in the price of breakfast). The breakfast main course menu features an enticing selection of Mexican specialties including juevos revueltos (divorced eggs), chilaquilles, juevos rancheros and the more international selection of pancakes, waffles and French toast. You will not be disappointed with any of these choices. My favorite breakfast entree is the roasted poblano pepper stuffed with scrambled eggs and served over a light tomato sauce. A drizzle of crema and a little pickled red onions add colour and flavour to this perfect creation. A selection of fresh juices is also part of the breakfast experience at the Rosewood. Try the green one, with chaya and pineapple. It's full of flavour and packed with nutrients. After breakfast settle with a cup of coffee or select one of the teas they offer and linger a bit before heading to the beach. To get to the beach catch a ride in a \"chauffeur\" driven golf cart (located at the front, behind the reception, where you drop off your car). At the end of the beach walk return for lunch at the Punta Bonita, the Rosewood beachside restaurant by the beach pool. Catch a ride back to the reception in one of the golf carts but before getting back to your car check out the store near the main building for fabulous jewelry by IDE, a local artist with a store in Playa on 5th Ave north, and for Helen Kaminski's famous straw hats. If you like the Pineda Covalin silks, from cover-ups to scarves, you will find them here as well.

It was truly like two hotels. During break - kid fest - almost every party staying at the resort seemed to have kids with them. Some babies, few over 10 or 12. The resort can definitely accomodate the traffic - you do not need to wait for chairs or miss out on a chair at either location (pools or dining). However, the noise level was higher than anticipated. After break - Rosewood tranquil - reminded us of Las Ventanas, but a little more laid back and definitely much larger than Los Cabos. Quiet, serene, breaktaking. The service is not Las Ventanas, but its definitely better than other resorts. (E.g., definitely better, more personalized service than a Ritz) We enjoyed our stay but toy with the idea of being there when there are less families. We did travel with our kids (10 and 12). The resort actively markets to families with babies and toddlers, so expect to see at least a few families with kids at this resort any time of the year.

We should have put more stock in the negative reviews \u2013 our experience was anything but the luxury we anticipated. First, there are some positives. The rooms are incredible -- they are large and well maintained. Likewise, the plunge pools are large and can be heated to an almost hot tub-like temperature, which is very nice. The complimentary snacks at the pool and beach are excellent and far better than we\u2019ve received at Four Seasons and other comparable hotels. The hotel also provides complimentary coffee and cookies in the morning, but does not advertise it and we only happened to stumble upon this on our last day. The gym is nice and well stocked with equipment (although it did start to smell and become cramped when I shared it with 5 other guests during a mid-day rain storm). Finally, much of the staff is lovely and accommodating. (However, as noted below, there were some staffers who were downright rude) Also, if you are willing to pay for it, have the hotel make arrangements for a driver to and from the airport. This was lovely and made the start and end to our trip stress free. On to the disappointments: 1. There is construction on the beach. It is loud and was going on all day, every day during our stay. This is a different construction from some of the pictures on Trip Advisor of the unfinished residences that are visible from the beach front rooms. Perhaps because of this construction, guests are cramped together at the beachside pool and only about 10-15 beach chairs are available on the slice of beach not directly in front of the construction. 2. The beach itself is narrow (i.e., not much width between the stairs leading to the beach and the ocean). What this means for guests of the Rosewood is a constant stream of walkers from other hotels coming a bit too close for comfort. There is an all-inclusive Sandals to the left of the hotel and it\u2019s guests tended to walk the beach past the Rosewood and towards the Banyan Tree (which is to the right of the Rosewood). For this reason, if you are staying in a beach front room, I would recommend requesting one that is farther away from the pool area. The beach is a bit wider there and/or the rooms more set back, so those rooms looked to be a bit more private. 3. The pools have issues too. The pool that is adjacent to the beach is quite small. During peak vacation time, I suggest you get up early to get a spot this pool. At one point, there were four or five couples in the pool at the same time and it was virtually filled to capacity. Since space was limited at the beach, we tried the pool next to reception and the restaurant one day. This pool is large and there is plenty of space, but there are a few problems. First, here is absolutely no breeze at the lobby pool and it was HOT. We could not sit there all day and certainly not in the middle of the day when the sun is at its strongest. Second, the balcony of the breakfast buffet overlooks the pool and we found it odd to be laying out below diners. Note that the lounge chairs at both pools and the beach are extremely uncomfortable and we expected better from the Rosewood. 4. The food is not acceptable. I know that many have praised the food in their reviews, and perhaps we are more critical because we live in New York City where there are excellent Mexican restaurants. All of the food -- in every single restaurant and from room service -- was low quality and poorly prepared. Much of the food tasted like it was premade and reheated (have you ever eaten microwaved steak? Disgusting) In fact, we were told by one waiter that we could not make changes to dishes on the menu because the food was prepared before service. I personally had stomach issues for days after returning home and wish I had heeded some of the older reviews that mentioned the same. Some culinary advice: (a) Skip the tequila bar, except for the beverages. The food there is inedible and the menu is too limited; (b) Breakfast is the best meal of the day at the Rosewood and room service was a notch better than the restaurant offerings; (c) Don\u2019t expect Mexican food offerings like table side guacamole or authentic Mexican rice, we\u2019ve had better from Uncle Bens; (c) The small plates at dinner at the beachside restaurant were the best the hotel has to offer. 5. Overpriced is an understatement when it comes to eating at the Rosewood. None of the prices on the menus include tax or service charge. An ocean side pizza listed at about $12 probably turned out to be closer to $20. 6. The breakfast buffet is the best meal of the day, but it too is extremely expensive and the staff does not offer the less costly options unless you specifically ask (so thank you to Trip Advisor members that included this in their reviews!). To me, this is just poor form. But, make sure to watch your bill at breakfast. Even when we told our waiter that we wanted the continental buffet and did not order anything off of the menu (which is part of the regular, all inclusive buffet), our waiter charged us full price because he noticed that we took some cheese off of the buffet. We had done the same on all prior mornings and were never advised that cheese was not part of our dining selection. (I mean, it is sitting right next to the fruit) The resulting exchange to lower the bill was quite nasty and left a sour taste in our mouths. 7. Upon arrival, the hotel puts a \u201chold\u201d on your credit card of an outrageously large amount. It probably was three or four times more than our actual bill. While this amount is not charged, the hold, the front desk admitted that the hold takes a few days to be released after checkout. This is not only strange, but it could cause a problem for someone with a low credit limit on their card. Our conversation with the front desk about this practice was tense and two different staffers could not properly explain the practice. 8. Bring bug spray, especially if you plan to sit on your patio overlooking the lagoon. 9. Do not expect peace and quiet. Rooms are either attached or spitting distance from neighbors. This means that you cannot sit on the patio or be in the plunge pool without hearing your neighbors if they are doing the same. 10. The wireless is spotty if you are trying to connect to the Internet with more than one device at a time. In other words, you cannot both be on laptops at the same time.", "Date": "February 28, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Deerfield, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cBEAUTIFUL RESORT!\u201d", "Author": "stephj18", "ReviewID": "UR125320461", "Content": "My husband and I just returned home from an 8 night stay at the Rosewood Mayakoba. There was good and bad, and for me, I would have needed a perfect experience to give the hotel five stars. First, the good... 1. The rooms are absolutely gorgeous. We stayed in a studio lagoon suite. They are clean, large, private and amazing! There was nothing missing here. We thought our location in Room 318 was terrific too! Just a short walk to anywhere we wanted to be. 2. We spent our days by the pool away from the beach (there were a lot of little kids at the beach pool and since we were traveling without our teenage kids......) 3. George, an attendant at the pool. He was awesome! He set up our chairs every day and kept checking throughout the day to see if we needed anything. 4. The unlimited complimentary bottled water. I am a HUGE water drinker and to have this amenity was great! 5. The friendliness of the staff. Everyone always says hi and smiles, but I would not say that people knew our name by the end of our 8 day stay. 6. The \"amenities\" handed out at the pool. Every couple of hours, the pool staff would hand out a little smoothie or taste of food. 7. The spa/workout room. Both are complimentary, so take advantage of them! Although the workout room is small, the equipment is state of the art and there are towels, snacks and water. Every afternoon, I would take a nice swim in the spa pool (aka the adult pool). Then, my husband and I would either go for a steam, sauna or jaccuzi. 8. The restaurants were accommodating with food. I am a picky eater, and they allowed me to make changes to the dishes. The bad: 1. As the week went on, and the resort became more crowded, the service at the restaurants was much slower and less attentive than the beginning of the week. 2. The restaurants. We found the food to be good, but not very gourmet. However, we did leave to go to the other two resorts at Mayakoba (the Fairmont and Banyan Tree) for three different meals. I have to say that those meals were stellar! Also, the hotels offer complimentary shuttle service between all of the Mayakoba resorts 3. The lack of help from the concierge. We had requested through our butler to have a reservation at El Puerto at the Fairmont. He confirmed it for us. When we should up for dinner, they said that there was no reservation for us. We ended up calling over to the Rosewood, where they tried to tell us that our Buter had changed the place; I knew that was not true. Anyway, my point is that the other two times we went to the other resorts, we went on our own volition and had no problem getting a table. So, there was no need for the conceirge or butler...go on your own and experience these resorts yourself. 4. Complete lack of nightlife. Although it is nice to have peace and quiet, there were absolutely no guests out after dinner....not hanging by the pool or in the bars. Perhaps if the hotel had some kind of music or entertainment, it would draw more socialness 5. There is really no beach. My husband and I are not beach people so this didn't really bother us, but I could see it being an issue. The beach is very small 6. The spa. Our body wrap and massages were average at best. 7.

Overall, this is a beautiful resort. All resort areas are beautifully done in a warm modern architecture. The protected lagoon is a great bonus for wildlife viewing including birds, crocodiles, iguanas, deer and sereques. We spotted the big 10+ foot croc on the way to breakfast. Ask for an Eco boat tour around 10 a.m. As they are complimentary and you get to see more than the standard room drop off ride. Martin gave us one and he is so enthusiastic about the wildlife and area that it made it so enjoyable! We had an ocean view lagoon room. Lagoon views from bedroom windows and ocean from roof deck and balcony. Plunge pool rooftop offers ocean views, very cool to relax and see the coastline. One thing missing from the room was the Mexican styled decor as the Rosewood Las Ventanas in Cabo. We missed that as it lent to the feeling of being in Mexico. Otherwise a top notch room. Our butler Carlos was attentive. He recommended an Italian restaurant in Playa Del Carmen called Cenacolo. One of the better Italian meals we've ever consumed. Their hand made pastas and ravioli are wonderful. Small location, make a reservation. The hotel excels at Mexican food( one would hope so, right). We recommend trying the Punta Bonita tapas menu for dinner as it provides great variety. Casa Del Lago does a good (not great, just a little bland) job of Mediterranean food. The breakfast buffet has enough variety to satisfy each persons tastes. The spa is lovely and use of the facility is complimentary (built into the steep resort fee). Decent workout room with good music playing. Nice sauna and jacuzzi. Adults only pool if you really want to escape the kids. We walked each time to the main resort but golf carts were always coming along. It took about 10 minutes but allowed us to work off those extra vacation calories and enjoy wildlife viewing. The beach is ok, I was hoping for better conditions for snorkeling at the hotel. However, the hotel's life guard can take you out on a sail boat ride to a reef about 15 minutes away. Of course, that costs a few hundred more. Instead, try standup paddle boarding which is complimentary and a great workout. Samatha at the concierge desk was great and booked an excellent private tour of Coba and Tulum. She was great ate playing our options and made good recommendations.

The attention to detail is remarkable -- fine bed linens, expensive tequila with fresh lime waiting in the room, windows that open and a/c that turns off, hot tubs on the lanai decks, flat screen tvs and wi-fi, windscreened caba\u00f1as on the beach where complimentary drinks, sorbets, and crudit\u00e9s are offered all afternoon -- you name it, it's done well.

How lucky can a person get? I can only reiterate what many have said regarding this resort. It is top drawer all the way with the service and amenities being among the best I have ever experienced, from the warm welcome and orientation as you are being transported to your suite by boat to the genuine and heartfelt thank yous and goodbyes you receive from the staff upon your departure. The Rosewood staff makes sure everything is just as you want it to be. Ask and you shall receive. We were upgraded to a Lagoon Suite and it really was truly stylish and comfortable. They even heated our plunge pool upon our request. Highlights included seeing an 8 foot crocodile swimming around our suite. Although the experience at Rosewood was superb overall, I must comment on two points that may be of importance to some travelers in their search for the perfect vacation. The beach, as others have pointed out, is really not that great. If you truly wanted to do some serious snorkeling, well you can't do it here. If you come to enjoy nature on the lagoon in a quiet and beautiful setting, then you can't fault Rosewood. The second point is that while the suites are luxurious and quiet, a lot of them may not provide the privacy you might be seeking because you can look across the lagoon and see the decks of other suites. There may be some suites that have privacy, but if that is important to you I would suggest inquiring before plunking down the hefty sums of money it requires to experience Rosewood for yourself. That being said, is Rosewood fabulous and worth the money for the ambiance and service you receive? Without doubt - it is.

The suites are beautiful--as others have mentioned, some are more private than others, so if you want privacy, definitely tell them so when you reserve. We had one of their basic lagoon suites and loved it. I'm sure the upgrades are lovely, but this was perfect for us. We particularly enjoyed the roof deck, where you can watch the clouds by day and stars by night, as well as the outdoor shower and the back deck with private plunge pool. The dressing area was also a nice plus--there was plenty of room for me to do my hair and makeup without being under my husband's feet. Even the bed was superb: among the most comfortable we have ever experienced. Our suite was private, and quiet, and altogether perfect for us to relax and enjoy the lush surroundings. The resort is fairly spread out, so you will likely want to take advantage of the golf cart service that can ferry you from point A to point B--we never had to walk far before one came our way, and the staff throughout the resort is incredibly pleasant and thorough, including the drivers. They all speak English, though a little Spanish (even broken Spanish) is appreciated. We also heard staff speaking French fairly fluently. The wedding we were attending was held on the grounds, as was the welcome party the first night, and it's worth mentioning that the staff went above and beyond for the events. The bride, who had been working with them for a year and spent many days at the resort preparing (including an attempted initial wedding date in October that was delayed by a hurricane!), was blown away by how beautifully everything was done. There were details they hadn't even discussed--like the taco station at the party, which had tortillas being freshly made right there, and the staff was so attentive to guests that they remembered what each person was drinking and brought new cocktails directly to them. If you're considering having your wedding or other event here, our friends highly recommend the experience. An added bonus is that the resort is small enough that they only schedule one event per weekend, so you won't be on top of another wedding. The food and drinks are to die for--we will be dreaming about fish tacos, ceviche Mexicano, and frozen mojitos for months to come. We didn't love the brunch, but the lunch at the beachside grill was so good, we had forgotten about it by 2 PM. I did not visit the spa, but my sisters did, and declared it among the best they've visited. There are yoga and Pilates classes, and even an adults only pool if you want a tranquil environment without children around. The aromatherapy massage in particular was recommended by other guests we spoke with.

I also had issues with the room: internet did not work in the room (resolved by the resort adding a modem) , no wine glasses , no corkscrew, poor lighting . While the Rosewood resort is immaculately maintained, I had the feeling that I could be anywhere in the world, there was absolutely no Mexican feel to the resort.

When we got to our suite (a single lagoon suite) we couldn't believe how terrific it was - we asked for a quiet room, and there we were - in an eden of tranquility - our back deck (yes, deck, with lounge chairs and a plunge pool) led to a dock in the lagoon, where we would spend our early mornings and evenings looking out at the birds flocking on the piece of jungle-grown land yards away across the lagoon, so that we felt we were completely isolated in our own cabin on a jungle resort. then there were the showers - one indoor and one outdoor, which was completely secluded but with some carefully placed palm trees, to maintain that tropical feel, and the indoor one, both with plenty of water pressure, - so relaxing and so freeing to shower outside! The suite also had a separate dining area, which made having room service in our room two nights a pleasure - the waiter sets the table, puts a small vase with flowers in the center, and next thing you know, it's a romantic meal with food that tastes great (and is still hot). Also all of the Staff - Pablo the Manager, each of the members of the concierge staff, the drivers in the golf carts who are always ready to give you a ride around the resort, the housekeepers, EVERYONE is so warm and friendly that they make you feel write at home. We also found Abdher, the butler to have the most wonderful smile, and was always ready to give us ideas on what to do (we highly recommend the cenotes!). Also, the golf course is beautiful - it also preserves the natural surroundings, and you will find a few of those sink holes (cenotes) on the course as well. Yes, this place is expensive - we learned only on the last day that the breakfast buffet, which appears to the be the only option (US$32 plus any soft drinks or espresso drinks) is not - you can ask to be charged just a continental breakfast if you really only want cereal of fruit, which adds up. we also took a pilates class in the gym one morning (they also have yoga, aerobics and other classes) was taught by a very good instructor, and we had a great workout, but we were surprised to find the US$15 charge did not include an additional facility fee. But you may find that it is more affordable than some of the other resorts surrounding it, and we left saying that it was one of the extreme few resorts where we felt like the price is justified. p.s. yes, the beach can be a bit of a distance from some of the lagoon rooms, but you never have to wait more than 5 minutes for a driver in a golf cart to come by and give you a ride; also, we understand that some may prefer the beach view, but we strongly suggest the lagoon view -- it's magical!!", "Date": "January 16, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hilton Head Island", "Title": "\u201cRelax in Style (But Be Ready to PAY)\u201d", "Author": "scblaw", "ReviewID": "UR123022223", "Content": "Spent 4 great nights in a Deluxe Overwater suite.

The suite are clean, well maintained, large and well appointed. In addition to the large tub and shower, we had a private outdoor shower in a small garden setting. The suite had a large veranda that overlooked the pool and the water cenote with its abundant wildlife. RESTAURANTS: The resort features three restaurants, but breakfast is only served at the main restaurant, Casa De Lago, where the only choice was the buffet which included a cook to order breakfast entree. While the food was good, it was a VERY expensive breakfast. For my wife and I, a $100.00 breakfast everyday seems a little much, when on most mornings, we would have preferred a simple bagel or muffin. Lunches and dinners were very good and all the ingredients were fresh. Service was attentive without being intrusive. And although expensive, dinners were not much more costly than we expected.

The resort feels very similar to a high-end 5/6 star asian resort.

Quality of the food at the restaurants was very good, even if not quite 5 star (still excellent for a beach resort). The Spa is also one of the most impressive we have encountered. Where they fell slightly short for us was on two counts: 1) They allowed a very large private party to close down parts of the resort (restaurants, poolside, etc) on different occasions during our short stay. We believe it would have been appropriate to advise us of this in advance (or at least at check-in - we only found out about it when attempting to make dinner reservations one night). Granted - they closed different parts (one of the two main restaurants) at different times so it was never fully monopolized, however again, a resort of this quality should have forewarned, 2) If you are travelling with children, it will likely be seen as a bonus that this resort is very kid-friendly. For us however, travelling as a couple, we did not appreciate the loud noises (child, baby) coming from the terrace of the adjacent casita on multiple occasions during our stay. While we recognize this is not under the resort's control, we would certainly request a more private casita or \"similar neighbors\" next time, if the resort didn't do so automatically.

I even emailed him at 11pm to confirm my SUV pickup and he responded within the hour! Thats the kind of service we got when we were over at Rosewood. Everyone there seems to know your name and you are always greeted with a friendly smile. I know you are paying for this service but still it does make you feel good. We ate at the 2 restaurants but preferred Punta Bonita best. We love the complimentary tortilla chips and fresh salsa and ate mostly the mexican menu there (though they have a western section). I love the fact that they remembered my special order drink for breakfast and gave it to me every morning without me asking for it. The upkeep of the beach was immaculate and there really wasnt too many ppl at the resort the time we went. It felt as if there whole resort was open for us. Even later on when a wedding was taking place (30+ guests?) it still didnt feel crowded. We visited Bayan Trees Tamarind restaurant for dinner and felt it wasnt as intimate as Rosewood (the restaurant was very big). Their service was good but we found the food overpriced and the staff wasnt as helpful. Instances where we were taking pictures we felt as if we were ignored, where the Rosewood staff would ask if we would like our picture to be taken. Though it might not be fair since there wasnt too many ppl working at Banyan Tree at night. Overall we were happy with our choice. It was a dream place with most importantly excellent customer service. Our concierge Gualu was really friendly and everyone was on the ball when we requested anything. We plan to come back for a visit in the future again! PS I wished we were informed about the time share agents (dressed in beige uniforms) waiting for us when you get out of the customs at the Cancun airport.

We were picked up at the airport in a luxury SUV and our driver was wonderful. He talked to us all the way to the resort, answering our questions and gave us some suggestions on additional activities outside the resort. When we arrived we knew the place was going to be exceptional, the main entry way has amazing architecture and views of the lagoon which wraps around the property. We then sailed away on boat to our room by Martin who was outstanding. Once we arrived at our room we were giving an amazing tour very detailed about our suite by JC (who was also amazing). We were overwhelmed by how spacious and nice our suite was and the amenities included. The 2 main restaurants on the property Beach Club Punta Bonita and Casa de Lago serve great food and we loved taco night at the Beach Club. The pools are both spectacular and even on a busy week there was still loungers available most of the time. The cabanas were occupied rather quickly each day but there are so many umbrellas that the cabana wasn't a huge need of ours. The pool over looking the beach is where we spent most of our time. It has a smaller pool for younger kids that leads into the larger pool. Who can complain about sitting around a beautiful pool over looking the Caribbean Sea. Our 2 kids loved the ability to be able to freely use the kids club and they adored both Erika and Regina who were both absolutely friendly, loving and took great care of our kids. They had a lot of planned activities each day with crafts, movies, games, drawing, pottery, pinatas, beach play, and best of all an eco-tour of the lagoon lead by a biologist. My kids loved the tour seeing crocodiles, turtles, birds, fish, iguanas. The beach was very nice for the first 3 days then a rain storm blew in and brought with it a lot of rocks and cloudy water so the beach wasn't as attractive after the storm. However, it didn't stop our kids from body surfing the waves, making friends and playing in the warm waters. We meet a lot of amazing families at this resort as it draws in a top-notch clientele. We like to travel and typically do not return to the same place twice. However, this place was spectacular and we'll be back and hopefully with other families we enjoy traveling with as well. Overall, a wonderful place and the staff always knows your name, kids names and is always willing to do whatever with a smile. Very good customer service as they always want to ensure your happiness while at the resort.

As with all reviews, they are totally subjective, so take from this what resonates, and discard what does not... This was our 2nd trip to the Mayan Riviera, last year staying at Maroma (which we reviewed), and a return trip to a Rosewood resort, having visited the fantastic Las Ventanas in Cabo San Lucas several times (which we have also reviewed). Myself and my partner stayed in a beachfront studio suite close to the beachside pool and Punta Bonita restaurant, and her parents and brother were in a beachside lagoon view suite just opposite ours. Let us start with the resort itself; it is a truly beautiful location, tastefully built with the mangrove swamps between the main highway and the wonderful white sand beaches of the Mayan Riviera, the resort (map available here: http://www.rosewoodmayakoba.com/en/i/downloads/Resort_Map.pdf) stretches from the lobby, boutique, main restaurant (Casa Del Lago) the bars and main pool down to Punta Bonita, the beach pool and the beach itself. The resort is defined by the many natural lagoons, and if you arrive during the day you can take an electric powered boat from the lobby to your lagoon side suite, otherwise an electric golf cart will whisk you there ... more on those later ... The architecture and layout of the resort is very beautiful, the rooms are spacious and well appointed the air conditioning is effective and can be welcome relief on the hottest of days. The bathrooms are simply stunning with huge tubs and refreshing rainforrest showers (ours had a door allowing you an indoor/outdoor experience. Our beachfront studio suite had a very private deck with a dining area, and patio/deck with a bathtub warm plunge pool. We were in one of the suites closest to the pool area, and we could literally throw rocks from our deck into the ocean ... to which we had direct access from our deck. Some of the other beachfront suites further away from the pool are set further back from the ocean and are in my opinion even more secluded and private than ours. ** my recommendation is that if you want a beach experience, privacy and peace, this is the only option at this resort ** there is excellent wireless internet service in the rooms and around the resort given the number of iPads, Kindles, Blackberries, iPhones, and iPods that were in evidence around the pool. Each room also has a fridge, which you can stock as you like from a special room service menu. My only complaint about my room was the bed, given the quality of the resort, I feel that the mattress was cheap, and rather uncomfortable, very springy, reminiscent of being 1/2 of a circus trampoline act as every movement your partner made bounced you around... only the pillows trumped the bed in their lack of comfort; a bag of potting soil from \"Home Depot\" would have provided similar levels of discomfort! enough of the room, lets talk about the restaurants... 1st the great one! Punta Bonita!!! Their tapas menu is a delight, and noshing your way through a few dishes while partaking of a cold beer or margarita is a great way to finish off a long day of relaxing ... special thanks go out to Victor, Luis and Oscar (Hola!) for providing great service with a smile ... Also, checkout \"Taco\" night there ... although a mecca for families (go after 8pm) its a fun experience... I wish Punta Bonita and the beach pool had a \"walk up\" bar ala Freddy's @ Maroma, where you could prop yourself up, people watch or just dry out while sipping a drink, sadly this is missing ... talking of fun experiences, try out the \"make your own margarita\" night at Agave Azul (I wish I had dined at their raw bar, it looks great) as well as the \"make your own martini\" at the apparently underused bar at Casa Del Lago. Speaking of the main restaurant; we dined there once, and also every morning during the breakfast buffet (included in our package). Words such as \"mediocre\", \"frenetic\", \"uninspired\", \"inconsistent\" come to mind! Lets talk about breakfast ... depending upon how busy it is, you could wait more than 10 minutes for your waiter to arrive at your table with coffee and juice, then having poured you some off they go again ... why not have the coffee and juice at the table? This makes more work for the wait staff, and results in the guests not getting coffee and juice when they want it? The food, well the buffet is extensive and covers most tastes, from the european to the american ... and there is a special section for kids (ah there go those bells again...) the \"hot\" menu is an interesting combination of pure mexican items to interpretations of \"american\" dishes... all are \"good\" ... however... if you order an omelet with chorizo & cheese, and the kitchen has no chorizo, so instead of asking if you would like something else, they simply make you a cheese omelet ... twice ... Also, whoever the breakfast expediter is, a word, \"eggs benedict\", my friend, is served with \"soft\" poached eggs and fresh hollandaise, not a hard poached egg and curdled sauce, back to Denny's with you! there seemed to be no time at which you could turn up for breakfast and expect relaxed, timely service ... Dinner, dull, dull, dull ... food, atmosphere, service ... with the exception of the sommelier who recommended a couple of very pleasant mexican wines that were reasonably priced. Now ... why did I dislike this place so much ... after 6 nights, and close to $10k ... SCREAMING CHILDREN OF ALL AGES EVERYWHERE ... at breakfast ... oh look babies crawling over the floor, aw your little one has stripped and is running naked around the dining room like its a play park ... at the main pool ... to the guy who spent 30 minutes trying to teach his kid to catch the nerf ball and who howled with disappointment every time they missed it (which was all the time) either give up, keep your disappointment to yourself, or throw them an easy one now and then, OK? To this same individual (you know who you are) vacations are for vacationing, the office is for business, the pool is not, especially when you seek \"quiet\" from your screaming gaggle at the foot of my lounger ... I hope whatever trouble you were having with the chairman and the board of directors, that their lawyer and your insurance could take care of it ... hint to all, take your business back to your room please... The main pool by the lobby etc is nice, its small, and rather fragmented, by 10am pretty much all of the loungers and cabanas are taken, and the flocks of kids are in full play while the \"yummy mummies\" are tuned out to the mayhem their offspring are creating reading Vogue. There is little respite at the beach pool down by Punta Bonita ... its also packed by then with even more kids running, shouting, splashing, crying etc ... same parents heavily anesthetized by margaritas seem to have forgotten the days of tranquility prior to them making their personal contribution to the 7billion ... Is there any place of solitude away from Playa Del DisneyWorld? ... you wont find it on the beach, but there are a couple: 1) in your room ... preferably beach side 2) at the Spa ... The Spa is simply wonderful, no screaming future captains of industry or their trophy wives practicing being obnoxious here, there is a small \"adults only\" pool with a few loungers around it, a small gym, some treatment rooms and in the male/female locker rooms there are some wonderful steam rooms, sauna, hot tubs and cold plunges ... I highly recommend spending some quality time there... Perhaps now I should mention the golf carts and the $5 a day bikes. The resort's layout, part of its unique attraction, means that the beach is about a 10 minute walk from the lobby area. Thankfully there are many golf carts that roam the various paths, and you can either call for one, or pick one up at the lobby/spa/beach. These can get very busy at mealtimes ... you can also obtain a bike, for a fee! ... we overheard a number of guests complaining that the bikes were in poor condition and required maintenance ... not part of the fee??? In all I could have stayed at the Fairmont or other \"chain\" hotel at a fraction of the cost, and had an equally unpleasant experience ... perhaps my mistake was to go that particular week, when the hotel occupancy was high and the number of children was way oo high for my liking at this price point ... I did not have the experience I was hoping for, and I am glad to be home. If you have kids, this is a great place, if you dont, and dont want to immerse yourself in the experience of vacationing with lots of them ... go to Las Ventanas instead.", "Date": "November 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Huntsville, Alabama", "Title": "\u201cAverage stay\u201d", "Author": "shefpat", "ReviewID": "UR121034681", "Content": "LOved the punta Bonita restaurant.

The grounds are spectacular and the staff and service were unrivaled to anywhere we've traveled (which is fairly extensive). We stayed in a Deluxe Lagoon Suite halfway between the Main Reception area and the Beach area. We were offered an upgrade to an Overwater Lagoon Suite, but declined because that type of Suite is actually smaller and does not have a roof deck. The Deluxe Lagoon Suite offered more than enough space. There are many videos on Youtube that can be searched to give you an idea of the space. Our days were spent at the beach pool which was extremely pleasant. It was mostly couples but there were a few children there. If you have children who need a decent amount of stimulation or \"stuff to do\", this might not be the best place. While they have an enclosed kids area, I could see younger children getting bored very quickly (we would not bring our kids here). My wife did get a spa treatment one afternoon and said it was one of the best she ever had. When we were there, they claimed 40% occupancy. It was clear than with even close to 100% occupancy, there would be no shortage of staff to fulfill any request. Every staff member knew who we were (as if they were briefed beforehand) and remembered preferences we might have made on previous days. All the food at the resort was delicious and we felt while certainly not the least expensive vacation, the value for what we got was superb. We ate dinner at the hotel at Casa de Lago which was quite good and also spent several nights in the nearby (10 minute car ride) town of Playa del Carmen. While it's clearly a tourist town, there's no shortage of restaurants and fun shops to visit during the evening. For those concerned about safety, there is absolutely no sense of danger in the town at all. Local street vendors can be a bit pushy and mariachi musicians will try to serenade you often if you're sitting outside on the street but a simple no thanks (or ignoring them) gets the message across without any issue.

The Rosewood was the last property we stayed in, (after La Amada and Grand Velas) and was the only one which was not all inclusive and therefore significantly more expensive. It was, however, worth every penny. From the moment we arrrived, we were treated with smiling, courteous service, refreshing drinks (all the drinks we had throughout our stay were excellent) and a relaxing boat trip to our lagoon suite to set the mood. We were taken through the mangroves, via the baby crocodiles and turtles to our very spacious suite. The room itself was spacious and beautiful with tranquil views in every direction, including the roof terrace. The scenery and architecture, lighting and layout really are incredible. Complete luxury, surrounded by nature. We had a huge stone bath, big enough for the whole family, indoor and outdoor showers (my personal favourite) and a little pool overlooking the lagoon. Absolute bliss. And we had the cheapest room in the hotel. It was cleaned twice a day, always before lunch and again at turn-down which was around 7pm so was always spotless - which isn't easy with all that nature literally on your doorstep and 2 small kids. The property is sprawled out amongst the lagoons so some rooms, the lobby pool and the beach are about ten minutes walk. Not far, but with 2 kids under 5 and the Mexican sun we didn't always feel like walking. Luckily, the golf carts, which the kids loved, were never far away to whisk us wherever we wanted. The beach was lovely, as were all the beaches we saw in Mexico, with soft white sand and clear water. Our children loved the beach and the kids club (which is conveniently located right next to the beach and pool) and were treated like royalty throughout our stay. The service was top class, and whilst we were greeted by name in each hotel we stayed in, the staff at Rosewood managed to be both more attentive and yet less intrusive at the same time. They never bothered us, just made sure we were as comfortable as possible at all times: changing ice buckets on the beach to keep our water cool, bringing little non-alchoholic cocktails to refresh us and the kids, cleaning our sunglasses and even noticing when I couldn't get comfortable reading on the sun lounger and bringing extra cushions! And always with a genuine smile. My husband and I took turns having a spa treatment which was wonderful, and my only regret is that we didn't have enough time to make more use of the spa facilities. Our favourite 'restaurant' was the tequila bar, where the drinks were fabulous and the mexican tapas menu was fresh and delicious. As was La Punta Bonita, the Mexican restaurant on the beach, which sadly was only open twice during our stay. The breakfast was also a beautifully laid out, extensive buffet, which was refilled constantly, with hot dishes cooked to order. Room service was also outstanding and always arrived within the time stated (usually 20 minutes). I read another review of the same hotel complaining about having to pay for WiFi. During our stay, there was no charge for this service at all. In fact, when the tropical storms were making it difficult for us to get internet access from our lagoon suite, the concierge immediately brought us a router and alternative password to get us successfully connected. The was also a Bose ipod docking station for our use. I honestly wonder if it was the same hotel we stayed at. Overall, we loved the Rosewood Mayacoba.

Probably the best suite we have stayed in and we have stayed at a lot of upscale resorts. The beach is beautiful and the staff is THE friendliest I have ever seen at a resort. EVERY single staff member says hello to you. I really liked that a lot. I don't think this resort knows how to say no to a guest. Want room service any time of day? No problem! They really do cater to your every wish. We went to the pool/beach every day and we ate at the restaurant by the beach. The first night was Mexican food night and it was really delicious and really expensive - over $100 US for tacos and drinks. Yikes! I would definitely go back to this place! Next time I would book a suite on the beach. We were a little sorry that we didn't. The beach suites looked AMAZING. We went to Playa Del Carmen one night. I was not impressed. Just a lot of people trying to sell you crappy jewelry. I had read so many nice things about Playa Del Carmen...I just didn't see the appeal. We will skip Playa Del Carmen next time, but I highly recommend this resort!", "Date": "August 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Nicosia, Cyprus", "Title": "\u201cMemorable honeymoon\u201d", "Author": "cktrav", "ReviewID": "UR117343223", "Content": "From our arrival at the airport to drop-off at the airport this place is fantastic.

Check in was spot on - even the welcome drinks were nice (and usually they are sweet and sickly affairs). We were taken by electric boat on a tour of the lagoon during which we were given cold towels and melon skewers with chilli, salt and lime -sounds weird but worked. The lagoon is teeming with fish, turtles and a huge variety of wild and you could just sit and watch it for hours. At the end of the boat ride we arrived at our suites pier where our butler was waiting. A complimentary bottle of tequilla was in the suite with lime and salt - nothing like a shot of tequilla to know you have arrived in Mexico. The room was huge (an island suite) and on two levels with a vast amout of space and flooded with light. Outside there were two places to sit out and an inviting private pool. The general finish on the room was super -marble, glass and wood used with perfect taste. I think there are two things you can really judge a hotel by - is there ice in the room on arrival and is the internet free and fast. The answer to both these was a definate yes. Food was great and a fair variety and we were told on arrival we could go to any or the other Mayakoba hotels and have food billed to our room at the Rosewood. Every single employee always had a smile for you and a Hola! They all seemed super happy and wanted do what ever they could to please - we were made to feel super welcome. Given the choice this would be my number one choice for 5 stars in the Riviera Maya absolutely no contest. I am a really demanding hotel guest (read my other reviews) but I couldnt find anything that didnt make me 100% happy on my one night stay (we had to check out of the tides!).

Let me elaborate: ROOMS = A+ We've seen ever category of room and were offered an upgrade, but we would never stay anywhere except the \"over-the-water\" lagoon suite. It is here that you get the true Mayakoba experience. Lounging on the private dock or in the plunge pool at sunset... watching the birds come home to roost on their own island... taking in the mangroves. These are our cherished memories. If you're looking for splashy bursts of color, you're out of luck. These suites are pure limestone and driftwood -- an organic reflection of there surroundings. Perfectly sublime. Spacious, open, modern and yet somehow warm and embracing. COMMON AREAS/DESIGN/ARCHITECTURE = A+ Words cannot do the lobby area justice. Nor can photos. You really must experience walking out onto the open-air common area that overlooks the canal, one of the pools, and two restaurants. Incomparable. And descending onto the dock and into the electric boat for the short and spectacular ride/tour to the suite is the perfect way to start your stay at this resort. \"Wow\" is an understatement. POOLS = A+ The *lobby* pool (for lack of a better description) is a multi-tiered paradise. You can take in the very best of the resort from here (canals/architecture). It is generally very quiet -- far less crowded than the beach pool. But the beach pool has its own merits -- more lively. More staff. SPA = A++++ Common area is to die for, including the spa pool. A truly one-of-a-kind setting with service to match. You would be remiss if you did not take advantage of all the spa has to offer every single one of your senses. SERVICE = B+ I have such mixed feelings about this. The staff members are a joy. You will never find nicer, more eager, more solicitous people anywhere in the world. The service here blows away anything in the Caribbean... (I'm talking to you Sandy Lane and the Caves, among others.) The people we were privileged to meet set the gold standard as far as we are concerned -- with only the lovely staff at Paraiso de la Bonita their equal anywhere. But we feel like the idea of a \"butler\" is better than the execution of the butler here. He/she failed to execute several of our requests -- including a cake and drawn rose-petal bath for a birthday celebration. This happened two years in a row. I'm still not quite sure what service the butler fills that other available staff could not. RESTAURANTS = B Breakfast is by far the dining highlight. While luch and dinner are good, service at the main restaurant can be a bit slow. And while we were there on our second trip, the main restaurant was actually closed one night for a wedding reception. We would have appreciated a \"heads-up.\" The tequila bar is fun. But nothing on any of the three menus will set a foodie's heart on fire. I'm sure I'm missing some of the finer points of our stay. One last note: We toured the neighboring resort (Banyan Tree) as well as the Mandarin Oriental. While very nice, neither can compare to Rosewood Mayakoba. They are not even in the same league.

We have stayed in many 5 star resorts around the world and this is simply the best place we have ever stayed. It started off on a high that continued right throughout our trip. We were taken to our room via a small boat on the lagoon, on the way we saw the resident crocs and sea turtles! The service was impeccable and was the friendliest we have ever experienced. They couldn't do enough for us, and they were incredibly genuine. In many resorts you feel as though the staff are being friendly because they have been trained to be so and they know that they have to be - at the Rosewood Mayakoba you get the feeling that the staff take immense pride in the resort. They took great care to attend to our every need and nothing was ever too much to ask. Whilst at the resort I was trying to improve very basic Spanish and all of the staff were only too keen to help teach me and help me improve my Spanish! Never have I had such a great response from staff. Everyone from the porters, to the waiters to the drivers were open and friendly. We stayed in a deluxe lagoon suite and it was out of this world! Huge Room! Felt like a small villa! Stunning views over the lagoon, with plenty of exotic birds flying around. Huge bath that took 45 mins to run! Outdoor shower was gorgeous every morn and eve. Room was very comfortable. V.Comfy bed! Stunning grounds of the resort, using the golf carts to get around was no problem at all, and never had to wait long for one, and you could always ring the butler from the room to send one to your room. Beach was beautiful. Sea was warm. Most of the time he water wascloudy but was still lovely to swim in. The beach staff were fantastic. Setting up your lounger or caba\u00f1a for you and bringing water/food etc. Good menu by the pool, lots of choice and good quality. The beach amenities as have been mentioned in other reviews was a great little touch. Ice lollies, iced coffee, fruit, sweets, juices etc. all very enjoyable. Huge thanks to Pavel and Elud. The two restaurants did very nice food. The casa del lago did some really great contemporary european food. Punta Bonita was our favourite as it was on the beachfront and had a great grill (steaks/fish etc.) and great mexican side dishes. Service was fantastic as ever - Huge thanks to Luis! Breakfast was best we have ever had at a hotel! Huge buffet selection and choice of American/European or Mexican Breakfasts to order, all included in the breakfast paid for. Huge thanks to Damian for his service! The room service was the best we have experienced also. Great food, and they would set it up for you in your room or on your terrace. Impeccable presentation. Huge thanks to Ruben! We did a private tour of the Chichen Itza arranged through the hotel (thanks here to Erick!). Oscar our guide was very knowledgeable and friendly. We thoroughly enjoyed our day. We visited the Chichen Itza, a cenote (which was great fun!) and visited a lovely restaurant in Valladolid (highyl recommended - not touristy and served more authentic local food). Again no complaints. Wasn't cheap but was worth it. We went into Playa del Carmen one evening, and not sure if I would ever bother again. Horrible and touristy. Lots of people on the streets \"praying\" on you trying to pull you into their shop/restaurant/bar. Not a particularly nice town. Only 20mins taxi from the hotel. We had a couples spa treatment which was sublime. Excellent therapists. Very professional. We had the best holiday we have ever had and a huge part of that has to be down to the service and the staff at the hotel.

Although we travel fairly well, I have never written a review till now, but am doing so because they simply deserve it! I will address the resort in categories: Transportation: We opted to pay the resort ($230) for our ground transportation to and from the airport. If you have been to Cancun Airport you know that there are dozens of drivers and hustlers literally grabbing your bags to get you into their car, and you don't know who to trust. So it was very nice just to be escorted (immediately outside the door) to a luxury Mercedes SUV, where we were presented with cold washcloths, and a cooler of availablke drinks for the 40 minute ride. Property: Unique layout and design of suites on this sprawling property. Unique in that most of the units, and the reception area, are built alongside a network of lagoons. In fact, after check-in, you are delivered to your suite via a charming 21' boat. This brief, but very cool ride allows you to appreciate the various villas, from a different perspective. The boat pulls right up to your suite, where you butler is waiting for you. If you absolutely love being \"right onn the beach\" then there are units better suited for yo than the \"lagoon units\", as it is quite a walk from many of them to the beach, although there is almost always a passenger cart shuttling around to scoop you up. Also worth mentioning is that the grounds are perfectly maintained, and the lush landscape is well executed to say the least. Suites/Villas: After much research we decided onthe \"Over the Water Lagoon Suite\". An absolutely perfect space! First of all, as you may have guessed by the name, most of the suite extends over the lagoon. The outdoor space is so pleasant with a small table and chairs, a very comfortable lounge for two, and a small, yet inviting plunge pool. We spent alot of time out there in morning and dusk, as it is the epitome of peaceful. There was a small island on the other side of the water from our deck, where there were all different types of birds to observe. Also turtles, fish and a couplke of alligators (or crocodiles...(I always forget which is which) swim by your deck throughout the day. The deck leads into the living room which has two walls which are sliding glass doors so you can create one large indoor/outdoor space. Mattress and pillows were so good it was tough to get out of bed in morning. Although I don't usually have much to say about bathrooms, I must say thos one rocked! The outdoor shower is like a little garden and the rest just so spacious and well-designed. Huge walk-in closet, separate vanity room, yada yada yada...get this suite! NOTE: Most of the lagoon suites are not \"over the water\", and are slightly less $$$, but without question, you should go up one category to the one we had. The suites by the beach are more expensive, but I feel you can get a beachfront room at any resort, so why not take the opportunity to enjoy something different. Besides, even the staff admit to the \"lower category\" over water suites\" as being superior. Service: So wonderful that we could not stop talking about it. The restaurants, the beach and pool crew, the room service...all were incredible. Several reviews here, mention that the staff all call you by name and it is a very nice detail I must say. I don't know how they remember, but they do and it is professional and courteous. The staff and butlers actually anticipate your needs rather than just responding to requests! Restaurants: My wife and I are two foodies, and not enthused by the mediocre, unimaginitive food at some places. We found the food to be very good here. Actually, the breakfast (included) was our favorite meal of the day. There is a comprehensive buffet, and ala carte choices featuring Mexican and American dishes. Breakfast is served in the main restaurant by reception overlooking main pool. This restaurant and the beachside restaurant (Bonita) are your twooptions for lunch and dinner. I reccomend the \"Taco Night\" (Wed or Thur) at la Bonita. I also reccomend going to the adjacent resort (on same property) Banyan Tree for a dinner.Make reservations for the Thai restaurant there as soon as possible, and know that weekends may be tough to get in as they seemingly hold tables for their own guests. Pools: Both pools are very nice, but we enjoyed the one by the beach a bit more. As mentioned earlier , the staff there is awesome. They come around every so often with small (yet thoughtful) amenities such as homemade, flavorful ice pops, an attendant who cleans your sunglasses, while another does that whole 'cucumber over the eyes with cold compress\" treatment. Not sure what that does, but it feels good. Spa: First rate spa! Nice gym, and very comfortable spa services available for fee and free use of sauna, steam, gym, jacuzzi, relaxation room indoors and out etc. Definitely another reason to choose Rosewood. I wish I could go into greater detail, but I am afraid I have to return to the mundane domestic duties that await us upon return from vacation.

The Rosewood was everything I hoped it would be and more. It's simply beautiful, the service is just amazing, it's peaceful, relaxing, the accommodations are terrific. There's really not much more you could want if you are looking for a romantic, peaceful vacation. I won't describe everything about the property as many have done that already, though I will say, there's still something awesome about being taken to your suite in a boat to your private dock, even if you never get on the boat again during your stay. Having a suite overlooking the lagoon is amazing. I loved having the plunge pool, even if I didn't use it all the time. It was great to have for certain moments. We enjoyed a one bedroom, two bath suite (we were upgraded at check-in). It's just incredible. The bathroom with outdoor shower, and the tub and regular shower that faces a private glass wall is spectacular. The suites are just amazing. The grounds are gorgeous. As for getting around. I had read about people walking or wanting to stay closer to the beach or lobby for shorter walks, etc. I will say this. We stayed in an area that was not really convenient to walk to either area (though in reality, we probably could have walked to the lobby area, but we were on vacation and had no desire to do so). But the golf carts come by so often to escort you wherever you want to go that to me, it doesn't matter where you stay on the property. We never had a problem waiting for transportation to go anywhere. I also have to compliment the service. The service is more than top notch. Everyone is so friendly and helpful, it's almost unreal. Somehow, by the second day, everyone knew my name and was always calling me by my name and asking how they could help. It's amazing, and really makes you feel special while on vacation. For the pool areas, most people go to the pool by the beach. We were there a few times but loved going in the morning to the pool by the main lobby. It was always more quiet and peaceful. The pool is amazing, and with less people there, you really feel like you are in paradise and the servers there can really give you personal attention. Every so often they come around with treats like ice cream, ice pops, and other goods, always bringing you bottles of water, etc. If you think of moving your chair, they are there to assist you. I'm not one to give personal shout outs in reviews. I always found that weird. But I have to give credit to Russell, our server at the Lobby pool who every day was nothing short of the best. Manuel was great too, as were others, but Russell was our guy. The beach pool was beautiful too, just busier during the day. When we went, we went towards the late afternoon when it settled down, and even were there one night close to 7:00 p.m. It was so peaceful, it was perfect. The beach is nice, just not very big. The sand was nice though to walk on. I'm not a huge foodie, but I thought the food was very good. Only problem we had the whole trip was Taco Night at the restaurant by the beach. The service was slow and we got the wrong orders when it did come (we even had to remind them about our appetizers we didn't receive that came with the meal), etc. Not a big deal. We were in paradise and refused to let a poor taco night interfere with our trip, but when they charge you $45 per person for tacos, it should be better than that. We're not complainers so we didn't say anything, but the infamous taco night became the running joke of the trip. We also ate at Saffron at Banyan Tree one night. I'm not a Thai food guy, but the restaurant was so beautiful, you should definitely give it a try. It's also great that you can charge it to your room at Rosewood. The free shuttle between properties is great, and it's nice to be able to see the other properties at Mayakoba. We personally thought Rosewood was nicer, but in truth, you probably can't really tell unless you stay at a property, but it made us appreciate Rosewood even more. The Rosewood spa was tremendous too, though the pool at the spa, in all honesty, was not very clean with lots of leaves floating around. It's surrounded by a lot of trees, so it's hard to keep clean (we were told by a guest they cleaned it that morning, so it must be just hard to keep clean where it's located). We had a couples massage one day and thought we'd spend the hours before the massage at the spa pool. No deal. We were there for about 15 minutes and went back to the lobby pool. But everything else about the spa is beautiful and first rate. The massage was in a hut (I don't know what to really call it) overlooking the lagoon, and the therapists were brilliant. Being a guy, I requested a masseuse (I've made that mistake before), but all therapists are female, so I was covered. All in all, the place is amazing. It was an unbelievable vacation. The service is just better than top notch. They make you feel so special, and any request you have, they are right on it. The place is relaxing, it's everything I hoped it would be for a trip with my girlfriend. I would recommend it to anyone I know thinking about going there or a place like it. It's top notch all the way.", "Date": "June 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Denver", "Title": "\u201cFantastic Hotel, Wonderful Hotel, Truly Top Notch\u201d", "Author": "love4vacations", "ReviewID": "UR111375147", "Content": "My husband and I visit Playa del Carmen with my family typically 2x per year.

It was luxury resort \"theater\" from the moment the Rosewood Cadillac Escalade picked us up. Cold towels, chilled water, and Mexican candies were a treat. But it got better once on property, with personal greetings, chia mojitos (which my wife proceeded to drink all week), and a safari boat tour through the resort. My 5 and 2 year old daughters loved seeing crocodiles, turtles, and a wide array of birds on this 15-minute cruise. It is amazing that one part of the resort feels like a natural habitat, and the other feels like an exclusive Caribbean beach club. The boat tour ended at our lagoon suite private dock, where we were greeted with our butler Russell. Inside, this \"entry level\" room (quoted at US$790) was spectacular. The private plunge pool, private sun deck, private outdoor shower, huge circular whirlpool bath, and sitting areas are notable. Granted we stayed during the height of family spring break, but the hotel was filled with high end families with young children. The complimentary Rosebuds Kids club featured an excellent array of activities (ie, boat eco-tour, pottery painting, sand art), and was conveniently located next to the beach pool, allowing our kids to drop in and out as desired. Overall, the food and wine selection was excellent at the resort's 3 restaurants. We highly recommend Taco night at the beachfront restaurant Punta Bonita. (We did venture out one evening, to the next door Mandarin Oriental, which was chic and modern, but didn't appear to be family friendly.)

I was traveling with my husband for a quick and easy getaway to celebrate his birthday and enjoy some time alone, leaving our 3 year old back in NYC with family. Traveling to the Mexican Riviera Maya is a piece of cake from New York and most other major U.S. and Canadian cities making this a perfect, simple, luxury getaway. Being that I am a travel agent specializing in Luxury and Corporate Travel, I arranged a VIP meet and greet service. As soon as I stepped from the plane I was met by a representative who quickly escorted me through customs and immigration avoiding all of the lines. I had only carryon luggage so it was just moments before the representative located my driver from The Rosewood Mayakoba and I was on my way. The hotel is about a 45 minute drive from Cancun Airport. The hotel will send a luxury suburban vehicle to transport you. The RW Mayakoba is a contemporary property with a Mexican flair. The public areas are very impressive architecturally and make an impact from the moment you arrive. The property has two very different sections, the lagoon section, and the beach section. You must be aware that very few rooms at this hotel are located near the beach. If you can afford to \u201cpay the premium\u201d for a room located in the beach section \u2013 it\u2019s a must! Personally, I was confirmed in an entry level room which is called a Lagoon Suite however I did tour every other room category. The one thing that I can attest to is that every room at this property has \u201cWOW FACTOR\u201d. The lagoon section is where most of the 128 suites are located as well as the Lobby, the main restaurant, the sushi bar, the Tequila library and billiard room. The beach section is where you will find the more casual restaurant, the infinity pool and the kids club. The two sections are separated by half a mile walk or can be easily accessed by golf carts which are continually shuttling guests around the property. The hotel is surrounded by crystal clear canals in and all of the rooms are located on water. All of the rooms are extremely spacious, private and luxurious. All are equipped with a private a plunge pool, ( the \"overwater\" suites are the most impressive rooms within the Lagoon Section). As for the d\u00e9cor, the suites are quite contemporary, but yet very nicely integrated with the surrounding nature, mainly a combination of stones and woods. The bathrooms are all very impressive. Most bathrooms have very sexy outdoor shower gardens, huge bathtubs and beautiful tiles. All rooms have very nice sitting/lounge area. The overall service is excellent and the staff is exceptionally friendly and helpful; you are also assigned a private butler to help you with any special needs. The food was quite good as well, featuring mainly authentic Mexican and continental cuisine. The pool and beach area of this property are exceptional. The infinity pool literally hangs over the very white sandy beach. I have experienced almost every luxury hotel located on the Riviera Maya and I have to say that this hotel has one of my favorite beach/pool areas. In general, the hotel is very \u201cadult like\u201d however they do cater to children. I was pleasantly surprised to see an infant wading pool and a very nicely equipped kids club within the beach club area. If you are a couple traveling without kids I would strongly suggest staying away from this hotel during peak times such as Christmas/New Years, Presidents Week and Spring Break as I could imagine that it might become a bit overcrowded with kids by the pool area which is not very large or spread out. However, if you are a family traveling together and require connecting rooms, book early because the hotel does have a limited supply of connecting rooms. All in all I recommend this property as a fantastic getaway for both high end families and couples.

We have stayed at the Ritz Carlton Bali, St Regis Bora Bora, Mandarin Oriental Hong King, Curtain Bluff Antigua and many others. While those too were beautiful properties and we thoroughly enjoyed all of them, there is something very unique and special about the Rosewood Mayakoba. The minute you are greeted, the pampering starts and it's hard to leave. You are always greeted by name and with a smile. The property is absolutely stunning and very, very well maintained. It is spread out enough to have a great amount of privacy in your suite and on the private terrace (with pool!) overlooking the lagoon, but also to feel that there are others around you. Within the first hour, we knew we would be back again. The suites are spotless and the bed and linens are some of the most comfortable we have ever slept in. The rooms are modern with flat-screen TV's and gorgeous local art. They are spacious, bright and the ceilings are very high. We loved the amenities and the soap smells divine. The same ingredient must be used in the body wash, shampoo and conditioner as well. It is no wonder why so many people go the hotel shop to buy it. The food served at the three restaurants is incredible and the chefs will happily come out and greet you and tell you what their favorite dishes are and why they prepare them the way they do. We were blown away by the breakfast every morning and the beautiful buffet of fresh fruits, breads, yogurt parfaits, fresh-squeezed juices, croissants, spreads, waffles, etc. We could not get enough of the food, from the homemade chips, salsa and guacamole at lunch to the fresh-baked breads, local cuisine favorites and incredible and innovative desserts (try the Punta Bonita sundae!) at dinner. You can not go wrong with any of the restaurants. The staff really steps it up in a way other hotels do not and it shows. We never once saw housekeeping anywhere on the property, but our room was always spotless when we returned from the pool, beach or diving. Same goes for the nightly turndown service (they left chocolates, fresh fruit, a cheese plate, nuts and more the first night). The concierge was extremely helpful and caring. She even sourced chargers for us to charge our blackberry phones and ended up using her own computers to do so. We never had to ask twice for anything and everything was always confirmed the day before, including spa treatments, diving, dinner reservations, etc. The Spa is world class and absolutely stunning. It is so relaxing, zen and once you enter, you never want to leave. The staff is gracious, caring and sensitive to the customer's needs. I am seven months pregnant and had a phenomenal pre-natal massage with a very experienced therapist who made sure I was 100% comfortable and relaxed throughout the service. I was so impressed with everything and plan to return to see the same therapist again. The amenities in the spa could not be topped anywhere, from the cold pool and the hot tub to the sauna and steam room. There is so much space and several relaxation areas and it's not hard to find privacy and relax. I am dreaming about going back to the pool, where I sat day after day enjoying the ocean view. The endless pool is mere yards from the soft white sand beach and throughout the day, you are served with special treats to keep you cool in the hot sun (complimentary snacks, cold towels, frozen hibiscus drink, pineapple popsicle, fresh cold veggies, etc). There is always someone asking if you would like water, a cocktail, lunch, towels. There is no doubt we will return again...and again.

We stayed for eight days in July in an Oceanview Suite. Since there are plenty of reviews that have covered the basics, I'll focus on our perspective as repeat guests and what was new to us... Suite The Oceanview Suite is one of only three room categories that offer ocean views (Deluxe Oceanview Beach Suite and Beachfront Suite are the others - the Beachfront Suites are the only rooms located directly on the beach, and are where we stayed on our previous trip). After having stayed at the Banyan Tree Mayakoba in March 2010 in a non-oceanview room I realized that being able to see and hear the ocean was very important to me. So, I loved that the Oceanview Suite enabled me to sit on the deck and watch the sunrise over the ocean with my morning coffee, or spend the late afternoon in the roofdeck pool with expansive views of the ocean in front and the lagoons in back. Our suite was clean, cool, and comfortable. The only downside is the connecting door to the adjoining suite, and it will likely be a future deal breaker for us in terms of booking this room category. The connecting door is wooden. It is located approximately 8-10 feet directly across from the foot of the bed, in the dressing area part of the bathroom. It does next to nothing to deaden the sound between the two suites. This was not an issue at first because the room was not occupied. But on the second to last night of our stay a couple with an baby moved in. We could clearly hear every word of the couple's conversation, and every squeal and cry from the child. There is a door between the bedroom and the bathroom that can be closed, but again, it does very little to muffle the sound. We didn't want to hear their conversations or the baby (especially while we were sleeping!), nor did we want them to hear us or have our activities wake the baby. Service The service was every bit as amazing as it was during our last stay. We especially loved the staff at Agave Azul - we can't thank them enough for the fabulous Tequila and Mezcal tastings, friendly conversation, wonderful service, and delicious sushi! It was our favorite part of the trip! Food Every meal we had was great, and we ate all of them at the resort. We loved the new wood fired pizzas at Punta Bonita - a great addition to their menu! As a vegetarian, I noticed that the staff this year seemed more knowledgeable on what that means. For example, when we went to Casa del Lago for dinner I asked if I could have the risotto appetizer in an entree portion since I was a vegetarian. The waiter quickly responded that I could, except that the risotto contained chicken stock. I was amazed by this, because even in the US where vegetarians are more common, I often find that restaurants offer fish as a vegetarian option, or don't understand why you're asking about the stock used in the soup. All of the restaurants were happy to accommodate a vegetarian, and often the waiters remembered me and asked if I would like the chef to make something special. And it wasn't because I was \"high maintenance\" memorable - I ignore things I can't see like chicken stock or lard when I am traveling. I usually order whatever vegetarian item is already on the menu, or I order a non-vegetarian item on the menu and ask them to leave off the meat. Overall We loved the great service, the delicious food, and the casual elegance. Hope to have our third visit at Rosewood Mayakoba soon!

By the way, if you're looking for a resort with a kids club that takes 3 year olds, good luck, this is one of the only ones in the area. The rooms are extremely clean, well furnished, the bed was like sleeping on a cloud. There is no partition between rooms, but the outside shower, plunge pool and terrace on top more than make up for that. The beach is too far to walk with small children (at least from our \"lagoon\" room), but the golf karts come by every couple of minutes so it's not a big deal. There were other people at the resort, but it never felt crowded. Before noon, you'll probably be the only ones at the pool. The spa is stunningly beautiful and the couples escape was great, very relaxing. Everything about the property is beautiful, the many pools, the architecture, the foilage, etc. The staff is the best I've ever experienced. Our room (in August) was $395 and included breakfast. Prices are \"boutique\", then add ~20% for service and tax charge and a little more for \"optional extra tip\". Examples (before service, tax and tip), kids buffet ~$12, guacamole ~$4, mixed drinks ~$12, grouper ~$25. Foodies, you will love this place. Absolutely everything we ate was divine.

We reserved a lagoon suite, which was more than enough for two people and was beautiful and private - a plunge pool, balcony, indoor and outdoor showers, amazing bed, and every amenity one could want. The service in every restaurant, at the pool/beach, and housekeeping were impeccable. One evening we dined at the restaurant at the Banyon Tree (Saffron) which was recommended by other reviewers, and I hightly recommend this as well. Make a reservation with the friendly Rosewood concierge and go early to have a cocktail at the beautiful bar at the Banyon Tree. While the Rosewood is not inexpensive, the summer special was a bargain considering the location, size and decor of suite, luxury, plus an extensive breakfast for two was included in the rate. We enjoyed the breakfast which kept us going until dinner. We were there for a short time so we didn't use the spa, gym, golf, etc.; our primary objective was relaxation by a pool/beach and romance, and this was the perfect place. The only thing that surpised me about this resort was the number of families. I can honestly say that we were the only couple staying there at the time; there were kids everywhere. This resort and the private suites just ooze romance, sophistication, and sensuality, and it seems to be designed for couples rather than families. In any case, it didn't bother us or spoil the romance but for those looking for more of an adults-only experience be forewarned.

The resort was beautiful and the service surpassed my expectations. I am writing this review to give the reader a way to rank the resort while searching for their perfect get-away. We stayed 5 nights in a lagoon suite, # 318, a secluded location on the lagoon side of the resort. There are two sides of the resort: the lagoon side and the beach side. Environment: The ambiance is tropical and relaxing. From the main pool and restaurant on the lagoon side to the pool on the beach side the atmosphere was tranquil. During our stay at the end of May the resort was 20% occupied so the amenities and restaurants were not crowded. Surrounding us were bright flowers and sunshine. The weather was sunny about 85 degrees and a bit humid. Humidity was equal to southern Florida, New Orleans, or South Texas. The bugs and animals did not bother us. The rooms were kept clean so rarely did we find bugs in our room. The only animals I saw were some birds and iguanas on the sidewalks. The iguanas wouldn\u2019t let us get within ten feet of them before they scurried off into the bushes. Birds lined the trees of the lagoon and pelicans soared overhead at the beach. The resort has paved paths for golf carts and walkers. You can reach anywhere in the resort with a ten minute walk but if you are not up for walking you can hop a ride on a golf cart to take you to your destination. Room: We stayed in a lagoon suite. The suite was fantastic with its private dock and outdoor shower. The room had a comfy king size bed, sofa, dining table and chairs, bar, and a grand bathroom. The tub and shower area were lined with class windows floor to ceiling providing a view of the white walls of the outdoor shower area. We took all of our showers in the outdoor shower! The tub is spacious and my wife loved it. We had the butlers run our bath water so it would be ready when we came back from dinner. The butlers not only ran the bath water but they put out candles and turned our bed down. This was beyond my expectation. The room had sliding glass doors that opened up the back wall to the patio, deck and plunge pool. We used the patio and deck to sunbath but we did not get in the plunge pool. I felt the plunge pool was more for looks; the water was too warm to be refreshing. Cusine: The food at the resort was spectacular almost too good. For me it was tough though, eating a 5 star meal three times a day for a week... seriously. The breakfast buffet as Casa de Lago was great but a little expensive at $35. And being the only restaurant open for breakfast we turned to room service for our breakfast. We could order what we wanted and that is all we were charged for. For us room service was a better fit than Casa de Lago. Lunch time we were usually at the pool so we ordered from the restaurant adjacent to the pool. The food was great but a little over the top for me. My refined pallet was craving a sub sandwich which did not get satisfied until I got back to Dallas. We ventured around to the other Mayakoba restaurants at the other resorts. Rosewood provided us free limo transportation to the other resorts. Our butler set us up reservations for us. We tried to eat at Safron at Banyon Tree but there was a mix up with our reservation so we were seated outside. After being bitten by mosquitoes we decided to not have dinner at Safron. Our favorite dinner spot was at the Mandarin Oriental. The food was wonderful and so was the service. As an aside I am a thrifty guy, I don\u2019t mind paying for good service but I do mind paying six dollars for a beer, which is what a bottle of beer cost in our room. So I kindly asked one of the bell boys to drive me to the nearest 7-11 convenience store where I bought a twelve pack of beer for twelve dollars plus tax. That\u2019s an 83 percent savings! We also went into Play del Carmen for a day to eat and check out the sites. He took a taxi there and back. A note on the taxi\u2019s. They will tell you the taxi ride is $70 but it is only $20. Make sure you negotiate a reasonable fare before hoping in the cab. Security: The Riviera seemed to me to be a pretty safe place. The Mayakoba community though, stepped up the security. I think they have guards on ATV\u2019s that constantly monitor the perimeter of the community. Controlled access monitors flow in and out of the community. We felt very safe. Service: The service surpassed my expectations. We were catered to at all times from the minute we arrived to check out. The best part was having a butler. We utilized this service to make our stay more enjoyable and relaxing. As an example I wanted to listen to my iPhone on the Bose stereo in the suite but I didn\u2019t have the proper cord to connect my phone to the stereo. I asked our butler if he could find a cord for me. 15 minutes later he showed up at our suite cord in hand! Rosewood has a spa and work out facility which can be used every day at your leisure free of charge. I wish we would have enjoyed the spa more than we did. We paid for a full body treatment, it was nice but I probably wouldn\u2019t do it again. Activities: We did not play golf or go kayaking. We enjoyed our time relaxing by the pool and beach so I can\u2019t provide any info about the activities offered by Rosewood.

Punta Bonita is the beachside resort and has great family style dinners - the grill amazing steaks, fish, etc. Take the waiters lead on what to order - they do know best. Lunches at Punta Bonita are fantastic. Always remember you are in mexico - when there is authentic mexican food on the menu - try it - you won't be disappointed. The beachside atmosphere is laid back but the staff is so attentive. The set up your chairs, move your brolly if need be, refresh your drinks - they don't miss a beat. The main pool is equally is great in service and we like that it is not too busy. Our habit is to spend the morning and early afternoon at the beach and then head over the the main pool for afternoon. It is a lovely area. Remember that you are in the jungle and that there are bugs - you can't avoid it. Bring some spray with you or bug lotion and just put some on before dinner. You will be okay. they sell it at the fantastic resort shop as well. Mayakoba is home to a few resorts - Banyan Tree, Fairmont, Rosewood and then outside the gates - mandarin. Banyan Tree has a wonderful thai restaurant Saffron that is not to be missed. Well priced and the food is quite delicious. Ambar is the fine dining restaurant at Mandarin and I have been there twice - it is okay - the atmosphere is lovely but there are never any people in there so it feels weird. I have only seen Fairmont from the beach and was not impressed. I believe it courts a different crowd than RM. The spa is located on a separate island around a cenote and is not to be missed. You can go there and enjoy the pool and the spa area and it is a wonderful experience. The resort is pricey - but you get what you pay for. You will have an unforgettable trip.

Generally, the staff is very courteous. The Questionable: 1. 2 bowls of Special K, a fruit plate, and coffee was $45.00. I travel extensively and this was by far the most expensive resort I've ever seen. Mozzarella, tomato salad and a glass of white for lunch $45.00. Starting to see a trend? 2. Quiet. Too quiet for us. We like our privacy, but you quite literally don't see hardly anybody at the resort. The main pool - maybe 2 or 3 people there at high point. The oceanfront - maybe 20 people and still out of lounge chairs. 3. The food. I didn't think it was very good at all (especially for the money). We ate lunch at the resort every day. Chicken fajitas were ok. Salads were ok. Burger was ok. Also, the restaurants hours were somewhat limited. 4. The resort is sooo spread out. You either wait forever for a golf cart (they claim a cart comes around every 10-15 minutes) or you walk in the heat. We waited one night when we were dressed for dinner for nearly 30 minutes - after we had called for a cart twice. Otherwise, you walk and walk and walk - almost 20 minutes to get to the beach from our room. We would not go back to this resort.

I especially appreciated the way the bedroom had pocket doors that we could open or close for privacy.

The service was also excellent: friendly, helpful, and attentive. Anything we needed was attended to with promptness and courtesy. The housekeeping was superb. Our room was always immaculate no matter the time of day and we were always stocked with fresh towels and comfortable bathrobes. The butler assigned to our suite even unpacked for us. The only downside was that the service at the restaurant could be slow at times. I also used the spa facilities on two separate occassions and found the experience very relaxing and rejuvenating. What I liked best about the Mayakoba was that, even though there were lots of families with children of all ages and the hotel was filled to capacity, one never got the sense that the place was crowded.

My husband and I are major foodies and majorly picky about hotels and vacations. This place was our favorite with our children. First off, this was the busiest week of the season, and the only time that was apparent was at breakfast. It was crowded in the Casa del Lago restaurant, but the service was still exemplary. They serve a green juice that is so delicious and healthy, and my children loved it. When we arrived, my children were exhausted, and they didn't make me do anything. They told me to check in the next day. I really appreciated their sensitivity. The room was spacious and perfectly laid out. Our three children were able to sleep comfortably in a room that was separated by pocket doors that we closed at night. We never heard a peep at night. The beds are amazingly comfortable. The rooms are lovely. Beautiful marble floors and bathrooms. Outdoor shower, deep tubs, and two bathrooms. We also had a lovely deck that led to a lagoon. My daughters loved going out on the deck in the morning and looking at the birds and fish. There are two amazing pools. One is at the main house, and my children played for hours there. The service at the pools was amazing. Frozen grapes, popsicles, mango sorbet, chocolate milkshakes served every 20 minutes. The pool by the beach is beautifully laid out and it was nice to go from the beach to the pool easily. The beach was nice, but not heavenly. It was quite windy, and the surf was a bit rough. In all our years vacationing with our children, they have never used a kid's club. At this resort, they loved it. The staff in the kids club really made the experience fun (puppet making, pottery painting, egg hunt, water balloon war) and my kids were asking to go. The food at the resort was amazing. We loved the Mexican specialties, as well as the more traditional dishes. We ordered guacamole and chips twice a day and my kids ate it up. The cocktails were delicious, and I would have had many more if my level head hadn't prevailed. The best margaritas I have ever had. Overall, it was a great vacation and worth the money.

For anyone thinking of doing the same, I\u2019ve written a review of Maroma as well. I can\u2019t help but review each resort with some comparisons to the other because so much of our experience was colored by what was different between the two places \u2026 admittedly; it was a luxurious \u201cproblem\u201d to have. But I suspect that we weren\u2019t the only two people in the world considering these two resorts so hopefully some of these comparisons will be useful. Overall, we had a wonderful time and a wonderful trip and will remember it all very fondly \u2026 we went to Cap Juluca in Anguilla last May and enjoyed our Riviera Maya experience more \u2026 and we enjoyed the break from the West Coast of Mexico vacations which we have taken more regularly. That said, Maroma and the Rosewood are strikingly different places for two \u201c5 star\u201d resorts only a few miles apart. If I could somehow combine the best of both places, it would probably be the greatest beach resort in the world. But that\u2019s not how it works. So I\u2019ll write a review here of the Rosewood Mayakoba (henceforth knows as simply \u201cRosewood\u201d) and then a \u201ctale of the tape\u201d comparison between the two but for details on Maroma, you should check out my review of it separately. The Rosewood is a stunning property. Everything is new and shiny and well built and well manicured and simply beautiful. The place takes your breath away \u2026 the spa and the rooms in particular. We splurged for a beachfront room and couldn\u2019t have been happier with the room \u2026 it was the best hotel room I\u2019ve ever seen in my entire life. On that front alone, the Rosewood deserves five stars. The Beach was apparently damaged during hurricanes of the last year or two and it is surprisingly narrow today. Entry into the ocean water is made difficult by the presence of pretty sharp rocks that first appear in about 3 feet of water \u2026 the soles of my feet were warn out getting into the water. It\u2019s particularly bad on rough water days. I\u2019m not sure what they could do about this, but if you\u2019re dead-set on spending your water time in the ocean consider yourself forewarned. This wouldn\u2019t be such a problem if it weren\u2019t for the fact that the \u201cinfinity pool\u201d at the beach was so small. And at least during the three days we were there, it was packed with kids \u2026 so back to the beach we went. While the breakfast food is fantastic, the breakfast service STINKS (one particular waiter, Rafael, is omitted from my characterization \u2026 he was terrific and I hope that he survives the three weeks that his young son will be away visiting family \u2026 thanks for stepping up and taking good care of us Rafael). The Casa del Lago restaurant is poorly laid out \u2026 such that it never seems to be more than \u00bd full yet, you are always waiting for a table that you\u2019d actually want. Then you get your seat and no one comes to help \u2026 or they help by dropping off menus and then walking away \u2026 guests will come later than you and get drinks and have orders taken and you\u2019ll still be sitting there with nothing. Everyone seems to be rushing around but there is no rhyme or reason to their service pattern. The wait staff doesn\u2019t seem to help each other out at all \u2026 if you aren\u2019t at a table in a particular guy\u2019s zone, good luck getting your mini cup of coffee refilled by him. It was just very haphazard and it happened every day \u2026 I think the folks are very nice, but they do not have the kinks worked out of their process yet and it is really annoying. Lunch at Punta Bonita on the beach is no different. The chips and salsa appetizer came WITH our meal \u2026 and average wait time was well over 30 minutes after ordering even though the restaurant was no better than \u00bd full. Things were better during dinner, but this is one area that Rosewood could really improve. They did seem to have some sort of athletic class each morning at the Spa, but they never advertised it very well \u2026 I would call the spa and ask what tomorrow and the next day\u2019s classes were only to be told \u201cwe don\u2019t know yet\u201d. It wouldn\u2019t be hard to make this better too \u2026 we were disappointed that the classes didn\u2019t seem to pan out in a way that you\u2019d have suspected with such a majestic spa surrounding. The walk from the beach to the lobby takes about 10 minutes \u2026 it is what it is. It meant that the pool at the lobby was never even something we considered doing which was a shame because it was slightly bigger than the one at the beach and more visually interesting. However, the golf carts came whenever we requested them and it all worked out fine \u2026 plus it was sometimes nice to have a long walk after breakfast. Our butlers, Nick and DJ, were both extremely nice and helpful and we are really grateful that they made our time at Rosewood easier. We took the \u201c4 Worlds\u201d private tour of Tulum and followed it with the caves snorkeling side excursion \u2026 really fun (although not for the claustrophobic or those with \u201ccity feet\u201d \u2026 it\u2019s rough traversing down there!) Eduardo of \u201c4 worlds\u201d was fantastic \u2026 couldn\u2019t recommend him more highly! The concierge at Rosewood set this all up for us and it was really nice and super convenient. Tale of the tape - Maroma vs the Rosewood Mayakoba: Best Room: Rosewood Mayakoba by a wide margin Best Food: Tie \u2013 both simply \u201cok\u201d Best Beach: Maroma by a wide margin Best Spa: Rosewood Mayakoba by a small margin Best Restaurant Service: Maroma by a HUGE margin Best Other Services: Tie, both great Best Pools: Tie, but in a bad way because both resorts pools were disappointing Most Quiet in public spaces: Maroma \u2013 no small kids Most Quiet in your room: Rosewood Mayakoba With astronomical prices come astronomical expectations. We had a great time, LOVED our room and go the rest and relaxation we needed. I think Rosewood has in place a great set of natural resources, they just need to DO some things better. Ironically, our other stop at Maroma was the opposite \u2026 they have older facilities but you really couldn\u2019t ask them to DO a single thing better than they already do it. Since the Rosewood\u2019s room was its standout quality, I would recommend \u2013 if you can afford it \u2013 that you get a beachfront room \u2026 it\u2019s crazy expensive, but it does really enhance the experience in the best possible way.", "Date": "March 26, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wyomissing", "Title": "\u201cCompletely relaxing vacation\u201d", "Author": "Paco1016", "ReviewID": "UR59016841", "Content": "My wife and I needed a warm and peaceful getaway and the Rosewood Mayakoba fit the bill perfectly.

There are some rocks on the beach, and only on the day where the surf was pretty rough was it necessary to be careful where you stepped getting out into the gulf. On most days, the surf is mild and you can see where your stepping, and so a few rocks do not present a problem. I have no reservations returning here to enjoy the beach and surf! Overall the quality of food was excellent. Dining at the Casa del Lago (main restaurant) provided the widest selection, but the room service menu as well as the menu at the beachfront restaurant were both more than adequate.

We had visited the Rosewood sister property, Las Ventanas, in Los Cabos, a few years back, so our expectations were high for this relatively new facility. Out of our 7-night stay, six days were beautiful, with clouds rolling in on the last. Also, occupancy was down during this pre-Spring break slot, so we found the resort practically all to ourselves, based in a Lagoon Suite. Elbow room is key for us, so the relative privacy was a major boon - we literally had the whole pool to ourselves or one day. Loud mouths at the pool or adjacent rooms could have spoiled things, but this can happen at almost any resort. The product behind these good conditions delivered. The service was highly responsive and polite. All room service was delivered within the promised 40-minute deadline. We were struck by the warmth and hospitality of the staff, who set the room with champagne, cake, and flower-strewn buble bath for my wife's birthday. The spa was top notch, with clean, spacious steam room, sauna, hot tub and plunge pools in the locker rooms. The treatments (massage, stone massage, and facial) were generally very good, though my diminutive \"deep tissue\" masseuse was unable to apply very deep pressure. I used the fitness center every morning. While it was quiet for me, I would imagine that it gets crowded on season, but three treadmills and five elliptical machines was more generous than many other fitness rooms I've seen at commensurate resorts. water was generously supplied here and throughout the resort. As stated by others, the food was very good if not impeccable. We were never disappointed by the beach restaurant. Some fishy-tasting sole at Casa Lago, overlooking the pool, was the only disappointment in 7-days, which isn't bad. One pleasant discovery was Casa Madero Chardonnay - a mild and balanced Mexican white which satisfied these two frequent Napa Valley visitors. With good detail, we were walked through several tequilas in the tequila bar, and purchased one of these discoveries (white Azul), to take home. Pool service was thorough, with constant water and beverage supply and complimentary refreshments as well. We didn't linger at the beach, where the seating seemed a bit tight, but we did walk it a couple of times. While some have complained about the distance to the beach from the main area, I would think that unless you are handicapped, 80 years old, or it's piping hot outside, there's no good excuse not to take the 5- to10-minute walk down and back. We declined dozens of golf cart ride offers as we enjoyed the stroll. It was ironic to see a few people taking golf cart rides to the fitness center (!).

This year, we decided to try the Rosewood after reading reviews in a few magazines and right here. We were not disappointed. The greeting at the airport was efficient, and we were at the front desk in 35 comfortable minutes. The roadside scenery is not the usual Caribbean display of poverty and shacks. As you leave Cancun and get into the area of Playa del Carmen the road feels largely empty. The entrance to the hotel is a huge concrete, glass and steel structure that frames a gorgeous lagoon and villa scene. A five minute, very bumpy ride gets you to the front desk, where an almost surreal level of service presides. After a quick check in with a lovely female staffer, you are escorted to an elegant boat and driven to the dock of your room. We booked an oceanfront suite, about a six-minute cruise through a jungle lagoon surrounded by teak and glass casitas. The suite consists of an ell-shaped space, the bed and a seating area along the glass doors to the terrace overlooking the beach, and a dining/bar area at the entrance. The baths are large and elegant -- double sinks, round tub, an open shower with a pedestal, all lit through full-length windows opening to a small rock garden and privacy fence. There is a safe, and good hanging space in the closet, but clothes storage shelves are skimpy. Big drawers would have been useful under the makeup console. The beds are awesome (Hastens I think). It is clear every staffer at the hotel has received serious and excellent hospitality training. They seem to do everything never to use the words \"No\" or \"I'm sorry.\" Any reasonable request will be met. I arranged a tennis session with a pro, spa appointments, and even to be served a steak while watching the Superbowl in the bar area without a hitch. Our plunge pool was small but nice and warm. The pool at the beach is lovely, with a great lunch menu and absolutely fawning and perfect service. The sun angle made our private deck shaded after about noon, so we used the pool deck every day for drinks and lunch and sunning. Some screaming kids put an edge on the last day, but a 20-minute foot massage listening to the ocean soothed that! The golf course is a beauty. Like most Caribbean courses, with the wind up it can be a bear, but I managed to break 80 easily from the backs without much of a struggle -- the shot values are classic, and the greens were very fast and true. The PGA was coming the next week, so conditioning was ballistic. There are some very long walks between holes, and I saw no caddies, but the GPS screen on the cart was very helpful when it worked, which was most of the time. Good practice range and short game area, excellent pro shop, serviceable bar and snacks. The food at the three restaurants is very good. The sushi bar has a small variety of fish, but it is impeccably fresh, cold and clear. The rolls were excellent. The main restaurant surprised us -- we both had roast suckling pig from the regular menu, and it was a tender, delicious rectangle of meat, with a crisp skin and a developed, complicated sauce. Lunches of seviches and salads at the beach were all terrific. The only negatives at the Rosewood are: 1) the distance from the main house and lower-tier rooms to the beach, and from the beachfront suites to the main house and spa. You seldom wait for more than 4 or 5 minutes for a golf cart, but you don't want to forget anything! 2) Another issue is the beach -- the water is generally calm and very shallow. You have to go pretty far out to swim, and except right in front of the pool, the bottom goes from sand to slimy rock fast. 3) The seemingly isolated resort is, in fact, surrounded by hotels as far as the eye can see, and some are pretty ugly. The guests at these hotels walk and jog up and down the beach in an endless (if not vast in numbers) procession of etiquette-free gawkers. Sitting on our deck by the ocean was like being in a shop window on Madison Avenue. People didn't just glance at us, they stared, with crooked necks and gaping mouths, from 10 yards away. The hotel staff was fast to prevent them from setting up shop on our beach or ever coming anywhere near the room, but there was no sense of privacy whatever from 9 AM to sunset, except in the room with the curtains mostly closed. Not much the hotel could do about that! What feels like a tranquil jungle inside the resort is more like a South Beach strip hotel once you're on the beach. Still, it did not distract from the lovely setting or our enjoyment once we got used to it. This is a unique and great property. The prices are incredibly high for Mexico, but I guess they figure extortionate rates and lower occupancy vs. merely high rates and higher occupancy is a balancing act. It's not great value for the money, but if money is not an object, it's a great experience for your memories. I would return for a long weekend again in a heartbeat, thought if the prices go up even a dollar, I'll look elsewhere next year!!", "Date": "February 11, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Austin, TX", "Title": "\u201cI can't imagine spending my honeymoon anywhere else...\u201d", "Author": "BAC46", "ReviewID": "UR53729776", "Content": "After reading Trip Advisor for weeks prior to selecting this property sometime in September, I thought it only fair that I join and comment on after my trip so that others who may also be considering the Rosewood for their honeymoon or special vacation have the opportunity to read the latest and greatest from real travelers just as I did. While my review may be a bit scatter-brained, and during parts mention the few negatives, I cannot emphasize enough that I am a fairly well-traveled and a VERY particular person, and that the bottom line is that I would HIGHLY recommend this place to anyone who really likes (and just as or more importantly doesn't mind paying for) what I believe to be perhaps the finest trip money can buy. So, here goes it... 1.) While most reviews mention the service, it really should be mentioned again. Five Star, A+++, service. If I had a dollar for every \"it is my pleasure\" I heard during the trip, it probably would already be paid for! They know your name, know your ordering tendencies, and more importantly, strive to make sure that every request is not only met, but met with a big smile and in a very timely fashion. I have told people upon my return to Texas this afternoon that if I called and told them I need someone to hold my book and turn the pages as I read on the beach, it would have been arranged in a matter of mere seconds. Sure you are paying for it, but these guys and gals really do make you feel like they care. 2.) The resort is not near as spread out as I feel as though others make it seem. My biggest fear in going was that staying in the lagoon suite (least expensive room) would be a pain as we would be too far from the beach. That was not at all the case. While we used the carts on occasion, had they not been available we would have never complained. If you are going to stay in the least expensive rooms, I highly recommend you to try to stay in the rooms in the 300 range. They are in the exact middle of the property, and no more than a five or six minute (beautiful and peaceful) walk to either the beach or the main restaurant/spa. We were in 318, and aside from the convenience had absolute privacy in our back yard. The shower, outdoor shower, plunge pool, room etc were all as good (or maybe even better) than advertised, and even after looking inside three other (and more expensive) rooms decided that 318 was just perfect for us. 3.) The food was good, not great. That said, admittedly I am a pretty big food snob. We thought that the breakfast buffet was very good and consistent, though we did grow a bit tired of it on days six and seven. The lunches both at the pool and at the main restaurant were not as good, and in our opinion too expensive (though the portions were more than generous). My preference for lunch would have been a little less food, a little more quality. Dinner, like breakfast, was certainly good enough, though the restaurant environment at night was a little blah. We ate one night at Amber at the Mandarin and Safron at Banyan Tree. The hotel provides transportation, and the food and environment in both instances in our opinion exceeded that of the Rosewood (however, the trips over there further reinforced just how nice the Rosewood property itself was as the grounds and attention to detail throughout the resorts simply put were not even comparable). We also went into Playa three times for dinner (La Parillia=good local Mexican-- not fine dining, but good food and a very fun night, Negrosal--- don't go--- after going there I was/am very surprised that Rosewood has it on its recommended list as it was perhaps the biggest disappointment of the trip, and Yaxche= local Mayan-- again not fine dining, but good food, and quite a bit of fun). Our plan was load up on breakfast, get through lunch, and have a big dinner. In all instances, the dress was surprisingly more casual than both my wife and I prepared for. 4.) While they allow children there, I cannot imagine why anyone would want to take them (or for that matter, that any kid would really enjoy it). I think that while the website photos do a wonderful job showing the architecture etc, they do not provide proof of just how relaxing and or quiet this place is (and presumably is meant to be). The beach is not much as far as recreation as there are large quantities of rocks and very minimal waves, and the accommodations lend themselves much more to the honeymooning couple as opposed to the family of five. On a couple of occasions we heard families complaining of their kids running out of things to do to the staff. I guess all I can say is that when I was twelve I had no appreciation for $30 breakfast buffets or private outdoor showers. People, take your kids to Disney Land!!! 5.) In closing, here is just sort of an off the top of my head list of other things of concern or question I remember reading on this site, and what my experience with them was: We had no issues with bugs. We were offered a discounted upgrade, but nothing like I had read about in the past-- again, after looking at other rooms we could not have been any more thrilled with 318. Playa the city was to us a bit of a disappointment. Lots of junky craft stuff and tacky t-shirts. I am still trying to figure out what is so \"European\" about it, and believe that aside from an opportunity to get away from the resort the typical Rosewood guest would only enjoy and occasional dinner there and perhaps one night of window shopping. We felt safe the whole time. We took a number of cabs, and were always surprised at not only how friendly everyone was, but also how well everyone's English was. The spa was amazing. We received a number of treatments, and not only enjoyed them, but also the steam/shower/grounds etc. Again, attention to detail here is as far as I have seen one of a kind. I think for now that is it. If I remember more, I will try to figure out a way to get back online and let you guys know. I cannot emphasize enough how much fun we had, and what a wonderful escape it was for us. I look forward to visiting other Rosewood properties as the opportunities present themselves, and am hopeful that this helped answer any questions that you may or may not have had...", "Date": "January 18, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "NYC", "Title": "\u201cAmazing, Amazing Resort\u201d", "Author": "69jets69", "ReviewID": "UR52578894", "Content": "Spent five nights at the Rosewood mayakoba in early August.

The campus and service even beat Las Ventanas, the Rosewood property in Los Cabos, where we took our honeymoon a few years back. We had a deluxe lagoon suite and although it was not on the ocean, it was incredibly beautiful and serene. The suites are top-of-the-line luxury. The private plunge pool overlooked the lagoon. Inside, there was a living and dining room, beautiful bedroom, changing area and plenty of closets, guest bathroom, enormous bathtub in the master bathroom, along with an indoor shower, a private outdoor shower, and roof deck. I particularly loved the outdoor shower and wish there was some way I could have one in my condo in NYC! We were a short walk from the Spa and one of my favorite things was the 8:00 a.m. class. It was a FANTASTIC workout and a little different each day (arms, abs, yoga, etc.). The gym and sauna/steam room/showers were also great. I particularly loved the showers that had one side that was glass and looked into what is best described as a tropical courtyard (although 100% private). We were also a short walk from the main dining room, central pool, tequila bar, game room, lobby and shops. The breakfast was included with our room and it was amazing -- a combination of a buffet and ordering off a menu (you could order as much as you want) -- and anything you could possibly want was there. Try the \"green juice,\" which is so yummy. I miss it already. We also had some great dinners on the resort -- and of course a lot of appetizers and cocktails while at the pool. The beach and beach pool was a short and fun ride on a golf cart. I thought I would be annoyed by having to get a ride to the beach, but it was so fast (the carts come by every few minutes) and it is fun and a good way to see the campus. One of the best parts of going to Mayakoba was the service. Nothing short of fantastic! We had two main butler (Russell and Ale) and they were so personable and took great care of us. In fact, all the staff, from maintenance workers and ground staff to the managers, were so friendly and welcoming. We left completely spoiled. We had dinner one night at the Mandarin next door and the Rosewood staff will drive you there and the Mandarin staff will drive you back. I thought the food was just okay, but it was worth it to check out the resort, which is very beautiful and grand. We also spent an evening in Playa del Carmen, which was a lot of fun. We had drinks at Mosquito Blue and then dinner at Yaxche, a Mayan restaurant. Great days trips are to the Mayan ruins. Tulum is about 30-45 minutes from the resort and Chichen Itza is about 2.5 hours away. The resort has an arrangement with a rental car company and the car was dropped off for us. We did Tulum one day and Chichen Itza the next. It could not have been easier. The Riviera Maya is a beautiful place to visit. It was an easy 3 hour flight from New York City to Cancun and then a short drive to the resort (they picked us up). Now is a great time to visit because people are not traveling to Mexico as much because of the Swine flu scare and the drug violence (that's in another part of Mexico and we felt 100% safe in the Riviera Maya, including walking around Playa del Carmen at night).

It was very close to the beach, the pool, and the kid's club. The property, itself is simply stunning. However, the service is several notches below the One & Only Palmilla or a Four Seasons. The employees are unbelievably friendly, and know you by name - there simply are not enough of them. The service at the pool or the beach is non-existent. You have to hunt down a server to get a drink, fresh towel, or order food. As compared to the Palmilla, where the staff constantly anticipates your needs. At the Rosewood, you have to ask 3 to 4 times before they finally meet your request. Other guests at the hotel had the same complaint. It wasn't one big \"screw up\" per say, but several aggravating \"dropped balls\" per day. If you are traveling w/ children, the Kid's Club is the BEST our kids have ever experienced. The staff are nurturing and wonderful. They had a pinata party one evening only for the kids, which was nice b/c my husband and I were able to go to the hotel's sushi bar. The butler service was great, too. Our butler made bubble baths for our kids w/ balloons. My kids LOVED it. I rarely write reviews on here, b/c we travel extensively, and most other Trip Advisor members have nailed it.

I think the staff needs to stay at the One & Only Palmilla to truly experience fantastic service so they can implement it at the Rosewood.

We noted that some others mentioned a mosquito problem at this resort. It is very true. The abundance of water at this resort (the lagoons surrounding the rooms and the main area of this resort) are the perfect breeding ground for a bumper crop of insects. Upon check-in, the staff supplied us with insect repellant cream, spray, and wrist bands. What does that tell you? Before I could use these products, I had been bitten. We checked in mid-afternoon, and went to our suite, which was spacious and decorated in eco-modern style. After a short while, we heard what sounded like leaf blowers outside. It was by then dark outside, and I looked out to see several groundskeepers, with backpack sprayers, heavily spraying all areas with what was most likely insect repellant. So the image this resort wishes to create, of being an eco property, is in reality an illusion, because you will be breathing in heavy doses of insect repellant, in order to not be chewed alive by mosquitoes. By the way, we were once at Disney World after closing, and after the guests had left the park, a small army of similar groundskeepers emerged, and in the same fashion, covered every inch of ground with insect repellant, so I guess this should be expected in tropical areas. It's just not usually seen by the guests. The suite was luxurious, with a living room/dining area with mini bar, bedroom area with swiveling flat screen TV, dressing area with vanity, and spectacular bath with double sinks, huge sunken stone-mosaic tub, and a glass-walled shower with glass door leading to a spacious walled courtyard with an outdoor shower. There was also a curved staircase, leading to a roof-top level with large outdoor couch and a good view of the surrounding area. The back wall of the suite was completely glass and led to a large deck with dining set, lounges, plunge pool, and steps leading to a dock at the lagoon. Everything was immaculate. The air conditioning controls were accurate. The bedding was very comfortable. The cuisine at the on-premises restaurants was very good to excellent. A few of the menu items were \"trendy\", and the combination of ingredients seemed incongruous. Portion sizes were more than adequate. Every staff person in all areas of the resort went \"above and beyond\" to see that we received excellent, pleasant service. There is no nightclub or lounge at this resort. There is a bar, so you can drink all night until you retire to your room. Getting around at the resort is by foot (remember the insects), by staff-driven golf carts, which during our stay were frequent and abundant, or by small lagoon boat, which picks up guests at the individual docks belonging to each room. The spa was excellent, complete with hot and cold plunge pools, sauna, stream rooms, and large outdoor pool with lounges. The treatments were luxurious. Treatment rooms are upscale mini-houses in the \"jungle\" -- again a very natural eco-setting. There is a golf course at the resort. Those we travelled with did not seem to care for it, and on their second golf outing, chose to golf elsewhere. I am not sure why. The closest town to the resort, Playa del Carmen, has many streets of restaurants, bars, and shops, with everything from cheap tourist junk to designer label clothes. It was not impressive to us.

The last vacation has been to Ritz Carlton in Grand Cayman half a year ago. This is a different kind of place all together. It is extremely pricey, even at the off season rates. But it's worth every penny! Transfer: Some of the reviews on Trip Advisor mentioned private car pickup with drinks and cool towels; I still don't know if we had to order it separately through the travel agent. Our package included \"American Express\" transfer which was OK (van with another couple). Had I not had the expectations of the private driver, it would have been fine. The drive from the airport is short (around 30-35 minutes). Hotel: This is an ecologically friendly place built in 2008. I would classify it as \"understated elegance\", not too over the board (like Mandarin Oriental that we ate at once). The finishes are extremely high end, very tasteful, not tacky, just perfect. This is a larger resort, but with a boutique hotel service. Almost all the staff learn your name and address you as such. Each suite has their own butler who is extremely accomodating. There was a bottle of Don Julio Tequila waiting for us upon arrival. There is a fruit basket that they refill every day and upon request get you fruits that you like (we requested mangos, peaches, etc.). Cleaning service was never late and started cleaning as soon as we would leave for breakfast. Turn down was also very good, never missed any service or made any mistakes. They would make sure that you are not in the room and check with butler to make sure it's convenient to get service. Rooms: We originally booked a \"lagoon suite\" with the offer to be upgraded upon arrival. They upgraded us to a highest level \"lagoon\" suite (with in suite spa treatment room), but not water front. To get to the beach, it's like a 5 minute golf cart ride from the lagoon. The suite that was originally offered to us was a huge duplex, leading directly to a spa with a private spa treatment room (in suite). Again, we just wanted to be waterfront, otherwise this suite was great. We upgraded ourselves to a beachfront suite, which was to die for! We did have to pay an additional fee, but never regretted it. Food: There are two restaurants at the hotel: main restaurant where they serve breakfast in AM and mexican beach front place. Now, when we were there they would open them on alternating schedule, but I would imagine that during high season both of them should be open at night. Also, I don't know if the mexican place also serves breakfast during high season. The food at both places was EXCEPTIONAL!!! We are from NYC, eat out all the time, have several Zagats in every bag. They really know what they are doing. We were told they chef is from Spain, so it's like taking a vacation to Europe. Again, every time we travel to Europe, the food is so different than here. That's what is felt like. The breakfast is not your traditional \"all inclusive\" buffet. You order main dish off the menu, but fruits, cold cuts, cereals, etc. you get at the buffet. They offer excellent service, pour your freshly squeezed orange, grapefruit, etc. juices, tea, coffee, etc. Overall, I loved it. For lunch you have an option of the mexican place, I'm not sure if the main restaurant offers lunch also (we don't eat lunch). For dinner, we didn't need to reserve a spot, but always called ahead for them to anticipate. Room service serves food similar in menu to Mexican place. Service was impeccable to say the least! Just top service all the way. In room romantic dinner my husband ordered for us: the set up was amazing, candles everywhere, 3-4 people serving you, the most romantic beach setting, etc. It's extremely expesive, the food was good, but not exceptional like at the restaurants (don't know why, maybe my menu pick wasn't the best). Beach: Excellent condition; right in front of the suite, the bottom wasn't ideal. If you walk to the side, it's just perfect, shallow, clear water. We swam at both locations as well as your own plunge pool overlooking the beach. Overall, I would highly recommend this hotel. There are kids there, but were all very well behaved. This is a very quite place with night life; perfect for romantic getaway and vacations with kids.", "Date": "September 8, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cSimply Perfect - can't understand why Rosewood is only #7!\u201d", "Author": "Bieberry", "ReviewID": "UR39690095", "Content": "My husband and I just returned from a 4 night stay at the Rosewood Mayakoba. We have been to many nice hotels from large to boutique, but we have never, ever, had service like we did at the Rosewood. This is an exceptional hotel in a perfect location and run by an incredible staff. It was a very nice touch (and not in an over bearing type way) that every staff member knew us by name. We were upgraded to an ocean view suite which was simply to die for. Comfortable bed, wonderful shower, roof top plunge pool (is this Heaven?). An unexpected perk: Carlos, our butler. He made our stay wonderful. I had accidently left my neclace in a locker at the Spa and just happened to mention it to Carlos the next morning in passing once I realized it was gone. Less than 30 minutes later Carlos tracked us down at breakfast and had my neclace in hand. The entire hotel staff was incredible. You can train staff to cater to guests...but it is another thing entirely to have the staff come across incredibly sincere in their effort. We felt at home at Rosewood and cannot wait to return. We walked up and down Playa del Carmen beach and saw many other hotels, some rated even higher on TripAdvisor than Rosewood. This makes no sense to us.

Mayakoba is different than others, its Vegas style huge! I read reviews on here, as I usually do before a trip, and should have done one thing differently ~ asked to be on the beach side of the resort. This resort is 75% set on lagoons and mangroves and 25% set on the beach. I am not complaining at all, I just like to be in view of water when on a beach vacation. We were triple upgraded to a \"spa island suite\" which was so nice and I was not about to say a word, this room was enormous, 2 story, 3 showers, a pool, electric shades on one huge glass wall overlooking a swampy lagoon (no swimming but many pretty birds to see). The room was great if you have to be on the lagoon side b/c it's walking distance to the spa, spa pool and workout facility ~ we swam laps and used the workout room daily. Which was super nice to have so close b/c I enjoyed showering, steaming and hot tubing in the spa, they have chaise lounges and juices and fruit to enjoy afterwards. And Elemis products. I had 2 massages by Esmeralda, which were deep tissue and great! Had we been staying closer to the beach, I wouldn't have gone to the trouble of taking a golf cart all the way up to the spa for a shower. SO either side you stay on has its benefits. The food was fantastic. The 2 restaurants rotate nights and the beach front has tapas for $5 each (enough for 2) and grilled lobster for around $30....guac and chips $4. Be sure and ask to try all the hot sauces, if you like spicey, they have like 5 or 6 that are so good! All the sides are $3. Unbelievable prices, we happily surprised. Breakfast is devine, you can eat like a king...the menu hot items and the whole buffett are all included. We usually ate breakfast and dinner only b/c breakfast is so filling. We went to Banyan Tree for a cocktail and to see the property, which is enormous and we heard from other guests that the food was great, heard from others it was \"different\"...(Thai food). We walked past the Fairmount, ew. Walked the other way past the Mandarin Oriental, not so impressive. Met people at Rosewood who said don't waste our time going to the other resorts to eat, so we didn't. I would go back for sure! But I must admit, I like Las Ventanas better b/c it's smaller, closer to the ocean and there are no kids! I don't mind kids, but there were a lot at Mayakoba, some were screaming \"marco polo\" for hours and some were crying...just not peaceful when you want to read and listen to waves....but I'm not so picky that it would ruin my days or my opinion of this property. Just be sure and get a map of the property and pick your room ~ the rooms like 100, 101, 102 and 300, 301, 302 were all walking distance from the restaurant and spa on the lagoon side....I'd really do my research if I were going here for the first time so that you dont get a room far away from everything and have to wait on a golf cart each time you want to go to the spa or the beach...stay close to one b/c you cant stay close to both.

It was absolutely gorgeous! We were triple upgraded to an Oceanview suite due to low occupancy (about 40%). This place was heaven on earth. The Room: Our room was stunning (509), with views of the ocean and the lagoon. The room was state of the art, with plasma tv\u2019s and a bathroom that was wonderful. Everything was so clean and fresh looking. We had a rooftop terrace with plunge pool\u2014again the views from up there were fabulous. The bed was soooo comfortable and I am super picky about beds and pillows. We were also pleasantly surprised that the wireless internet was free and fast! Also plenty of channels to choose from. Just FYI we toured a beachfront suite to see the difference and, while having the ocean one step from your patio would be fantastic, those rooms were very small compared to the Oceanview suite. Our upgrade allowed us to utilize the butler (for no extra charge) and that was fun too. She even asked if she could pack our bags for us! We didn\u2019t really use them that much because we were super low maintenance on this trip ie no kids and only there to RELAX! The Resort: The resort is ginormous! You get anywhere by either golf cart\u2014these are very handy and efficient\u2014or boat, a novelty but much slower than the other. My husband and I spent most of the time at the beach, beach pool and the beach restaurant. We NEVER had to wait for a table, a chair, a beach chair, a drink etc. There were plenty of guests, but it never felt crowded like some of the other nearby resorts. One of the super memorable things was the little treats the staff would hand out while lounging at the pool\u2014we got mango sorbet, rice water with cinnamon, cucumber lemonade, coconut sorbet\u2014to name a few. We were never offered the same thing twice and they did this at least 3x\u2019s per day! So yummy!! The Employees: Words cannot describe my feelings in this area. These folks exemplify the meaning of service. My husband owns several restaurants and knows A LOT about service, obviously. We were never told no, were always greeted with a smile, hello, nod. 90% of the time they remembered our names!! It was fantastic, flawless, friendly, welcoming\u2014our RM friends include Ed, Ale, Sebastian, Frank, Angel, Naz, Veronica, Fermin, Gabriel, Javier (driver)--they were so sincere and one hit it off so well with my husband he actually gave him a parting gift! They made this trip what it was and they will be the reason we return. I have never been to a resort/hotel that had this consistently high quality service. The Food: pleasantly surprised! We did venture outside the RM because we really like variety in food and the resort only had one option per night. We realized after that we should have just stayed at the RM! Our anniversary dinner was spent at the Saffron at the Banyon Tree-the resort right next door. This was FAB, thai food with impeccable service as well. We also had dinner at Anbar at the Manderin Oriental and the food was terrible and very overpriced. We also ate at Ceviche Cha Cha Cha on a recommendation also at the Manderin\u2014very casual by the pool and the food was so-so. The rest of the time we ate at our resort\u2014the Punta Bonita for our final dinner and it turned out to be the best meal we had the entire trip\u2014close 2nd was Saffron. Lunch at Punta Bonita was good and the dessert was awesome!!! The Beach: I really loved the Riviera Maya beach. The water was warm although it was rocky and seaweedy and when we bring our kids back we will need swim shoes. They groomed the beach each morning with a tractor. It was beautiful. Spa: Fabulous! One of the greatest things is that you do not have to have a treatment to go the spa and utilize their facilites! That is a plus! I had the signature massage and it did not disappoint. Everything was wonderful. Nearby resorts: My husband and I spent some time looking at the other resorts along Riviera Maya. Without a doubt we would choose RM over and over and now feel fiercely loyal to them. Mandarin Oriental \u2013 this resort is slightly north of Rosewood-not even comparable to RM if you ask me, the grounds were unkempt and dirty, the beach setup was nothing fancy and the staff were RUDE! I would never stay there! Banyan Tree Mayakoba\u2014this resort was unbelievably cool looking and we almost stayed there. The staff were similar to RM and our food there was delicious. The only place comparable to RM in my opinion. Conclusion: I cannot wait to go back and take our kids. This was the best trip we have ever been on and this includes our honeymoon to Europe! I cried when we had to leave and have been depressed ever since!! GO THERE!!!!!!!!

What a fabulous trip! There aren't enough gushy adjectives to describe the hotel, its restaurants, the beach, and the service. A hotel representative and cars and drivers were on hand in Cancun to meet us at the lovely international airport--a shiny, air-conditioned Mercedes SUV for us and another SUV for the luggage, golf clubs and scuba gear. If you have any trepadations about the drive to the resort, put them aside. It was a short 30-45 minute drive on a four-lane divided highway. Our driver was excellent, and the ride was most comfortable. The bad press Mexico has received worked to our advantage. Our accomodations were upgraded to two commodious luxury suites, each with plunge pools and numerous balconies. Food in all of the restaurants was delicious. Breakfast at Casa del Lago was an eagerly anticipated event every morning. Starters consisted of a lavish buffet that most hotels would have considered more than adequate for a complete meal. But not the Rosewood Mayakoba. Entrees are ordered from the menu and prepared individually. By special arrangement, this feast and breakfast via room service were included in our room charge. Due to the low occupancy in the resort, dinner was served alternately in two restaurants: Casa del Lago for fine dining and Punta Bonita for less formal dining. Both were outstanding. While I have read negative comments about the value and quality of these two restaurants, I must disagree--that was not our experience. We enjoyed wonderful food for prices that equaled what one would pay in any major city. We also had drinks and light fare at Agave Azul Raw Bar, which was also delicious. The swimming pools, lagoons, extensive grounds, and beach were totally wonderful. Everything was sparkling clean. Service was excellent--exactly what is expected in a five-star setting.

The two resorts combined perhaps make up the finest destination on the planet for a vacation. People always talk about Thailand and Asia as the finest but when you can be at your destination in a short plane flight and arrive in pure paradise this is where it's at! We spent a week at the Rosewood and although we did not stay at the Banyan Tree we ate a dinner there and also got a tour of the rooms and property. All the reviews are spot on about beauty, service, location and amenities...it does not get any better and these hotels put most 5 star hotels world wide to shame. First of all and very quickly, anyone who has concerns about health issues, safety or swine flu should leave the United States and move down to this location......it is one of the most pristine places you will ever go to. The airport in Cancun is spotless......the media has blown all of these issues out of proportion and do not believe a word of it! Even Playa del Carmen was spotless. We couldn't find a piece of garbage on the ground. It is a shame these people have been losing jobs and businesses because of this. I have been traveling to this region for almost 30 years and I have always felt healthy and safe no matter where I have stayed. Thankfully the crowds seemed to be picking up the last part of our trip. That said, here are some highlights that might make you consider staying at this hotel. It is now a no brainer for us, we will be back. * Easy to get to. 30 minute drive from Cancun airport. 10 minutes North of Playa del Carmen, so if you want action it is very easy to get to. It now costs 17.00 from this resort to Playa each way not including tip. Upon arrival you feast your eyes to one of the most beautiful resorts available. We used USA Transsfers/Entertainment Plus Co. You pay when they pick you up at airport and its 90.00 round trip. Check out their web site. Cabs are more as is the hotel car. *Check in is a breeze and it is so much fun to take in all the beauty. You start relaxing immediately. *The food is the finest I have ever had at a hotel. I thought it was better than any Ritz or Four Seasons we have been to. Anything can be prepared off the menu if you have any special dietary needs. The breakfasts were fabulous as well as the beach side food. We ate one night at the Banyan Tree Thai restaurant and loved it...plan on spending 200.00 for two people. I am sorry to say we did not eat at Casa del Sol due to many trip adviser reports but we will definitely give it a try next time. We ate at a great restaurant in Playa one night and found the food and service to be wonderful...Cocina 38. Right on 5th Ave and 38th. Nothing fancy but very good food. * I find the Rosewood hotel and the Ritz Carlton Cancun the only hotels around the globe to make Margaritas EXACTLY the way I like them... using no synthetic mix and adjusting the sugar level any way you want it...Bravo on this. Don't complain that drinks are pricey at these resorts, how do you think they pay for this heavenly arrangement. Margaritas are 17.00 each and other drinks less. If you are trying to save money in this department stock up at a store on the ride from the airport and put in your fridge but it is vacation and part of this price is the outrageous service. There were some fabulous wines which is usually a no go in Mexico. Every night they have a special theme to check out, wine and cheese tasting, tomato night, Greek night and so forth. * The spa is the best I have ever been to and I am a spa junkie. It puts some of the well known U.S. ones to shame. It's not too big and not too small...just right and you can use it when ever you want, not just if you get a treatment like many spas require. I loved the pool at the spa for swimming laps. No one was ever there and it was fun to use. You could go use the sauna, steam, cold or hot plunge pools, seven headed shower, any time also. The gym has state of the art equipment and is wonderful to work out in. I had four different treatments and all were fantastic. The only one that was less than outstanding was the detox wrap. They do not have a Vischy shower and there was nothing in this session that even remotely made you feel healthier, hardly any rubbing either, and a lot of the time you spend showering off. You might as well use the seven headed shower in the main spa with the salts and oils they give you to rub on your body yourself. That was my only complaint about my treatments. Other than that there is nothing not to enjoy. We got a spa brochure from the Banyan Tree and I am sorry we did not spend a day over there for treatments also. They had a huge variety and the spa looked unbelievable. Again, how nice to be able to use two different spas on the property! *Rooms were amazing as every one has said. We were upgraded from a lagoon beach side to an ocean view beach side...basically the difference was huge...the ocean views sit on top of the lagoon beach side rooms and as far as I am concerned had the very best views of any of the rooms, along with the most privacy. You sit up real high and your plunge pool over looks the entire span of blue ocean not just the patch in front of you like the beach front ones. I would now always book the ocean view ones when we return. When you walked by the beach fronts you could see right into their rooms unless they had the curtains closed, so this kind of defeats the purpose of having that view. Not that I was looking in peoples rooms but when you walk the beach you do tend to look at the rooms. The ocean fronts are also smaller and do not have a big outside private space, they also do not get the sunset like the ocean views do each night. That said, the price is almost the same and each person will certainly have their own preference. The real biggies are the deluxe ocean views, they are huge and look amazing for a bigger family. The beach side lagoon rooms looked dark with no light at all, we were glad to have been upgraded Their only plus was being very close to the beach itself like the ocean views. All of this said, any room in the resort would be wonderful. Look at the hotel map and you will get an idea of where things sit. * We got a tour of the Banyan Tree rooms next door and they will also knock your socks off...much larger spaces, almost like suburban town homes with Asian flare. Huge pools, separate living room house, gigantic bath rooms, amazing closets and a kids bedroom and bath room upstairs that is enormous, your own grill and extremely private. The only draw back in my opinion was the darkness of the decor. Lots of the furniture was dark and heavy feeling. Again very lovely but I did prefer the Rosewoods contemporary stone and glass look...this is just my preference. I loved the fact that the Banyan Tree had bikes you could ride any where. The Rosewood does not have bikes and I am asking the management to please consider this also.....this is a must at this resort. Just in case your interested in the pricing of the Banyan Tree rooms they told us they were lower priced now than usual due to low occupancy. The two bedrooms went for 800.00++ and they said they normally start at 1200.00++. Beach front suites were much more expensive. *We saw plenty of kids at the resort and the kids corner (for ages 3-10) looked wonderful. It is right next to the beach pool so a perfect set up for kids to keep busy and then also hang out by the pool. All the kids that we saw there were super well behaved...have no fear on this. *The beach is wonderful. Some days you would have some floating seaweed and some areas were rocky but for the most part you can walk for over 20 miles and find tons of heavenly sand and gorgeous strips of water every where. You will see how the area has grown but they keep a height restriction in this region unlike Cancun which really keeps the charm. The Rosewood beach set up is fabulous. Cabanas are free if you desire some shade and there is not a bad spot any where near the pool or beach. I do think it probably gets crowded during high season though. Sandra and Gabriel are outstanding servers. Their personalities beam happiness. The big pool near lobby is amazing and as everyone says it rarely gets used. We used it once just to experience the grandness of it...the cement chairs that sit in the water are amazing to tan on. Do give it a whirl. * There is a little secret if you like fishing and do not want to do the boat charter thing and drive 30 to 60 minutes to your location. My husband did a charter out of Aventura. This tour was recommended by the concierge and..... NOT a good choice. After driving 45 minutes to get to the charter my husband found out every one else had canceled and he was the only one going out.....no problem, except no one on the boat spoke English and not once did they talk to him or ask him if he needed any thing. He also said they didn't go out far and no fish were caught like they usually do in this area...total rip off. We wished we had listened to Trip Adviser advice on this one. The consolation was the fishing he did with the life guard Rafael (Rafa) at the Rosewood. Thank you Villa for this tip...you are also a very special man! Rafa will bring you out on a small Cat just past the reef (no charge) but please tip well. My husband caught the biggest fish of his life (about 35 pounds) and he had a blast. Rafa is an amazing guy and one of the nicest people you will ever meet. He will help you with kayaks and snorkeling gear also. They do not charge for any of this but I would encourage tipping these people well as they are extremely generous and kind. So if your not up for a charter just go out with Rafa right from the property, you wont be disappointed. * The entire Mayakoba complex is eco-friendly and the architecture is built to work hand in hand with nature and the preexisting environment. Pictures do neither of these resorts justice for this reason...They are much better in person. Both resorts are truly 5 stars. I laugh when I see people say the Royal Playa Del Carmen in town is 5 star, we have stayed there also and believe me that hotel is like a 2 star compared to the Rosewood or Banyan Tree. The golf carts work nicely although I am sure during high season you can end up waiting for them...This is why there needs to be bikes! We tipped every time we rode but I can tell they do not expect it...again the charm of good service. * We did not use the butler service but I am sure they can come in handy if there is something you need done. Running errands on vacation can be tedious. To conclude I would like to say that the Rosewood vacation was our best yet and we will surely return.

This was our fourth time traveling to Mexico since that time, and we finally can put an end to our quest for a dream vacation. Rosewood Mayakoba delivered a honeymoon worthy vacation. We stayed for seven blissful nights during the second week of June. To be fair, we also got a great deal on our room rate - about 75% off the normal rate. We booked the most inexpensive room (Lagoon View Suite), and our wonderful Virtuoso travel agent (email me for contact info) was able to get us a confirmed upgrade into an Overwater Lagoon Suite. However, when we arrived we were upgraded to a Beach Front Suite! The resort was at 30% capacity due to the swine flu scare, and it appeared that most (if not all) guests had been upgraded to the beach side of the resort. Our room rate also included breakfast and a $200 resort credit. Rooms If you are a beach person, and if you love privacy, then there is no better room than the Beachfront Suite. Every morning our butler would set up our chairs on our private deck for us, and we had an uninterrupted view of the beach. We didn't have to lug around a big beach bag, we could walk a few steps into our suite to cool off in the air conditioning, check to see if we were getting sunburned, or grab something new to read. We vacation to \"get away\", and we truly felt that we had plenty of breathing room. If you are a pool person, or a people person, the lagoon suites would definitely offer a wonderful experience. However, you may have issues with the mosquitoes if you are staying in one of these rooms during the summer months (and you plan to spend time in the evening on your deck). If you are a beach person, who wants tons of privacy, and can pay the price, then stop reading this review and go book yourself a Beach Front Suite - you will not be disappointed! Food We had breakfast at Casa Del Lago every morning. The food was always delicious and fresh, but it wasn't quite as good as the breakfast buffet at the Ritz in Cancun, which is our absolute favorite, and is completely over the top in terms of variety. All of our other meals at the hotel were eaten in our room or at Punta Bonita. We chose Mexican dishes at all but one meal, and everything we ordered was great. We thought that the meal portions were the perfect size and the food prices were reasonable for what one would expect at a luxury resort. However, the $14 margaritas did tend to add up! We ventured to the Banyan Tree to eat at Saffron one night for dinner and it was an amazing experience. The Rosewood concierge had let them know that I am a vegetarian, and the chef came out to discuss his thoughts on the menu that he would cook for me, and asked for my input! When traveling, I'm used to ordering regular menu items without meat, eating things that I don't particularly care for, or ignoring the fact that items may be cooked with chicken stock or lard. It was such a treat to have my own special menu, created on the fly by the chef. Not only that, but the food was heavenly! After dinner we went to have drink in the lobby bar. They had a large selection of fun and unique cocktails and we lingered for a while listening to the musicians who were playing in the courtyard. Activities We received an activity sheet for the week in our room when we checked in. I was pleasantly surprised to see all of the things they had going on, because their website doesn't really list much. They had an exercise class that changed daily (beach running, zumba, power band, etc.) every day at 9:00AM for $10. They also had a special event every night. We went to the wine and cheese tasting at the Casa Del Lago bar. It was a lot of fun, but I wished that the wines were all Mexican, or at least South American. You could also get a back massage or cold foot rub every day at the beach for $40. Finally, we woke up one morning and the ocean was as smooth as glass, so we asked our butler to bring us snorkel gear. We snorkeled in front of our room, and were told by the lifeguard that there was a reef that we could get to in about 10 minutes by using one of their kayaks. Our inertia prevented us from going, but now we have something to look forward to for next time! Tipping This was the most confusing part of our stay. Who gets a tip and how much? We had gone to the bank at home before our trip and stocked up on ones, fives, and tens. Cash tips were much appreciated, even at meals, and we decided to err on the side of generosity, but we were never quite sure what was expected. Other Tidbits - The room safe easily accommodated my 13 inch MacBook (and all of our other safe items), although the wireless service in our room was spotty. - There is a cable on the Bose radio in the room so that you can plug in your iPod. - The mini fridge in the room keeps beverages ice cold and is large enough that you can add a few of your own items. - The deck lounge chairs were the most comfortable that we have ever experienced. - The house tequila is Milagro.

Occupancy was low which likely enhanced our experience but the resort and its staff are ideal. We have stayed at the Four Seasons in Nevis, the Burj Al Arab and Mandinat in Dubai, and Atlantis in Nassau and found this to top them all. Here's an overview of our trip Day 1 We arrived half-hour early on our Jet Blue flight from JFK to Cancun. As others have mentioned the airport is full of people trying to sell you things - we got more offers for cabs than time shares but just smile and say no thank you and keep walking. Immediately upon leaving the airport terminal we saw a man with a Rosewood Mayakoba sign (we booked private transport through the hotel ahead of time) who introduced himself and showed us his ID card, warning us not to accept trips from those who claim to be from the hotel without ID. Perhaps a little disconcerting but probably good to know. Quickly our Mercedes SUV pulled up and we were offered candy, water and cold towels. It's not a very scenic 45 min drive to Playa De Carmen but our driver pointed out a few of the other hotels along the way as points of interest. Once we arrived we were blown away at how attractive the outdoor lobby area is and were seated at the front desk for check-in and promptly offered mojitas. Check-in was quick and like others we were upgraded to a beachfront suite - this was done partly as a treat due low occupancy but also because the hotel wanted to keep guests in one area to make it easier for them to clean, etc. Smart all around. We were hoping to take a boat to our suite as we had read about but the boat had just left so we were taking by golf cart. On our way to our room we could see that everything looked immaculate and the pools very inviting in that hot sun. We arrived at out room which was also immaculate, cool, comfortable and had a nice-sized plunge pool on the deck looking over postcard-perfect blue waters. The beach itself was white but short - the color of the water is the big draw. Our butler for that afternoon (they vary throughout the day) gave us an overview of our room and then we decided to go eat at the beach side restaurant Punta Bonita for lunch which was only a short walk from our room. Due to the low occupancy only Punta Bonita was open for lunch each day and it alternated with the other , Casa Del Lago, for dinner each night. We thought the food was quite good and got better as we stayed longer. The first meal was only so-so admittedly - I had a hamburger and my wife a Caesar Salad. After lunch we decided to hang out in our room and enjoy the plunge pool and gorgeous weather. It was the first time for either of us in a plunge pool suite and it was great - the water was clean and kept at a very comfortable temperature and the luxury of having this privacy was great. For dinner that night we had to eat once again at Punta Bonita as it was the only choice. We enjoyed our steak (NY strip, a bit on the fatty side but with a delicious wine based sauce) and shrimp very much. After dinner we walked to the other side of the island just to check it out and found out how expansive the resort really is. On the way back we took one of the golf carts that shuttle guests across the resort because it is so big. We had room service bring our dessert - I had delicious chocolate ice cream but my wife's vanilla sponge cake was only so so Day 2 We were up early in the morning and called for a cart to take us to Casa Del Lago where we had our first breakfast which was included in our rate ($650 per night but with taxes and fees, $810, expensive but worth it). Unlike other breakfast buffets the hot items are ordered off a menu which are cooked to order and served as you go to the buffet which has fruits, cereals, yogurts breads and juice. The food was excellent and the hot menu is quite expansive with Mexican and American items - the latter including steak and Eggs, Eggs Benedict and some of the best bacon we have ever had. It was around this time we started to learn one of the key elements that makes the service at the Rosewood Mayakoba stand out. They really go out of the way to accommodate all your needs and every time you say Thank You the response is always \"its a pleasure\". Now this could come off somewhat Stepfordian but it really sounds genuine here. After breakfast we decided to hang out by the gorgeous big infinity pool by the restaurant. No one else was there at all - we had the whole pool to ourselves and this was true the entire trip practically. As soon as we chose our chairs an attendant covered them and created a pillow out of a towel and left us towels to dry. We read in the hot Mexican Sun got into the pool, got out , read some more, repeated. Meanwhile we were offered several free treats throughout the morning including chocolate \"smoothies\" which were essentially milkshakes. We got two each - not just one - since no one else was there. Then we got fruit and more drinks - it really felt like being royalty. By 1 or so it was time for lunch so we took the boat through the lagoon to Punta Bonita for lunch. Our driver found the crocodile that lives in the waters for us and we watched it among the shore for a while. The whole thing felt a little Disneyesque - kind of like Jungle Cruise. Our lunch was good - wife had hamburger and I nachos. We spent the rest of the afternoon on our deck/pool. Dinner that night was at Casa Del Lago, which we reached by cart - call your butler and one shows up within a few minutes.. This is fancier than Punta Bonita - my wife had filet and I had pasta with seafood. For dessert my wife had a chocolate/coffee ice cream concoction and I had just vanilla ice cream. Day 3 Once again we hung out by the infinity pool at Casa Del Lago after our breakfast and once again we had the whole pool to ourselves for another day in the sun. We headed to Punta Bonita for lunch again where we each had fajitas. Then back to our room for plunge pool side reading and swimming. For dinner this night we went to Banyan Tree - one of the other resorts in the Mayakoba complex (we did not go to the Fairmont and the Viceroy stopped construction). We wanted to try the Thai restaurant Saffron but were told by our concierge the resort was only opening the other restaurant Tamarind because of low occupancy. We decided to go anyway and our hotel drove us over with no charge In fact it should be noted that while the Rosewood is expensive they do not nickel and dime you while you are there - a lot of little services are provided for free. It was night so we could not see a lot of the Banyan Tree but it was big and oddly empty - we were told of the 142 rooms only 7 were filled - 5% occupancy - very sad. Stupid Americans still worried about swine flu are decimating tourism there for no reason. There was only one other couple in this giant outdoor restaurant. The food was good - I had Kobe beef and my wife chicken - and we asked to get a tour of a room but they would not do that that night (offered for next morning but we declined) Banyan Tree drove us back also for free Day 4 This was our five year anniversary. We woke up for breakfast per usual and received Bellinis in honor of our 5 years. Instead of going poolside right after we went into Playa De Carmen for shopping on 5th Avenue. The hotel drove us in (25 min) and picked us up - again at no charge. It was very hot so walking up and down the streets became uncomfortable after a while but it is a good long stretch of streets with junky souvenir shops, nice little craft stores, jewelry shops, local restaurants and US chain fast foods (subway, DQ, Starbucks). We stayed about 2 hours and our hotel driver was promptly waiting for us with cold towels and cold water for our drive back. We took the boat back to the beach side of the resort and after lunch swam in the Infinity Pool on that side for the first time. Most of the guests of the Rosewood seemed to hang out by this pool even though its smaller. We enjoyed it enough but not as much as the other pool. After some time there we went back to our room and we received a knock at the door which was a little anniversary cake. We put it in our mini bar fridge to save for after dinner. Dinner this night was again at Casa Del Lago. This time we both had the delicious fillet and got yet another anniversary cake as a surprise (plus ordered a vanilla milkshake which wasn't on the menu but we asked. They really will make anything you like it seems). Day 5 This was our last day but we didn't need to leave for the airport until noon so we took a last swim in the big infinity pool - once again all to ourselves. Our final checkout was quick with no mistakes and our driver took us promptly to Cancun airport All in tall this was a fantastic four night stay. . Rooms were great - luxurious and comfortable - you could never leave them and have all that you need. Service is outstanding - little is out of the question and everyone has a genuine smile and greeting. Food is very good - a few things weren't great but most of the meals were quite good. Pools - excellent. Clean, perfect temperatures, quiet and with excellent service. Grounds - Clean and expansive.

We had 2 beach-front units in spring break so maybe the price we paid was higher than the norm but compared to our experience at Casa Misha and other well-run service hotels, we thought the Rosewood was mostly mediocre. For example, we must have been asked like 5 times before our arrival if we had any dietary restrictions and we told them in detail what these were before we got there. Lo and behold, upon our arrival, neither our butler, nor any of the restaurants, nor the concierge has the slightest clue or interest in our dietary requirements. Well \u2013 why ask then!?!?! That said, our kids had special slippers and special robes and the rooms and the view were fantastic. The rooms and the quality of materials used throughout were terrific. The beach and pool-side service were very good. At the restaurants, they definitely accommodated once we informed them of our dietary restrictions \u2013 and the Mexican restaurant is fantastic while the main one we weren\u2019t overwhelmed by. Now, getting around the place is a bit of an issue and sometimes you had a nicely dressed couple waiting in front of their unit for 10+ minutes waiting for one of the golf-carts to come by and take them to the lobby area. Also, the hotel was packed with Americans and there were many, many New Yorkers there. Finally, I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s just me and we aren\u2019t a family of great swimmers but the water was not particularly calm and rocks in the water really bothered me (though the sand itself was beautiful and a great place to walk). I was afraid of letting the kids go in for fear of hitting their head against one of the rocks. Another friend of ours at a resort in Tulum cut his foot on some rocks in the water and we saw the facial expressions of the poor souls who ventured out into the water and must have been stepping on rocks on their way back to shore. All that said, we chose the Rosewood because we didn\u2019t want an all-inclusive and wanted to go to a hotel that welcomed kids but wasn\u2019t over-run by kids either\u2026 the Rosewood was perfect for all of this, the quality of its construction, reasonably good service (though not living up to its price-point) and an overall peaceful and relaxing experience.", "Date": "June 13, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Miami, Florida", "Title": "\u201cSpectacular\u201d", "Author": "RGSCRUCIAN", "ReviewID": "UR32192671", "Content": "This is a perfect place for a quick escape into great luxury.

We stayed from May 30 to June 5. Arrival: Highly recommend booking transportation through the hotel; just be sure to ignore everyone claiming to be your ride. You will be greeted with a sign once you step outside by a Rosewood employee who will take your luggage and promptly provide you with cold water and candy for the children. Once we arrived at the hotel we were in awe at how beautiful and open the hotel was. We were then taken to our room via boat while we enjoyed frozen mojitos and fruit. We knew within the first 20 minutes of our arrival that this was going to be a spectacular vacation. Due to the low occupancy we were upgraded to the deluxe ocean view room which was amazing. It was almost too big (but no complaints). The room was 3 floors and had both a view of the ocean as well as the lagoon and perfectly situated near the pool/restaurant/kids club and the ocean. Our two children (age 4 and 6) stayed on the second floor and were thrilled to see a bowl of chocolate chip cookies and their very own bathrobe and slippers waiting for them. Food: My husband and I are pretty serious about our food, so we were a little disappointed after a long day of traveling with two kids we were hoping to have a very casual dinner at the beach restaurant Punta Bonita, but it was closed every other evening alternating with Casa Del Lago which is more \"formal\", so we were kind of forced to eat there the first night. We were not impressed at all. What made the meal worse was it was expensive and I found my meal almost inedible...I know I was tired but several other couples that we met also shared the same sentiment. Breakfast was excellent and included with our package. I have to say it was so nicely done and was presented beautifully. It was a great way to start the day. We basically ate at Punta Bonita everyday for lunch since we were at the pool/beach all day. The fare was basic and pretty good and not expensive. After the 5th day we were getting sick of eating the same things as well as the kids were tired of having \"kid\" food. But the staff was more than accommodating when we asked for things that were not on the menu. We also had dinner at Punta Bonita twice with the children and it was very nice and casual. We checked out the Banyon Tree hotel for dinner and were blown away by how scenic and amazing this hotel was. We ate at Tamarind; it was so incredible that we cancelled our reservation at Ambar for the following evening at the Mandarin Oriental so that we can check out Banyon\u2019s main restaurant Saffron - by far our best meal the entire vacation and worth every penny. Spa: Amazing! Probably one of the best I've been too and highly recommend using it for more than 1 service. Kids Camp: During our stay there were never more than 4 children at the resort (and two are my own) so it was never the typical chaos that you would find at a resort with a ton of children, yet there was so much for the kids to do that they were NEVER bored . The Camp is included and the kids loved it. It is located right near pool beach area so it was nice for the kids to pop in to play the wii when they had too much of the sun and swim. There were movies, games and crafts. My daughter made a pi\u00f1ata filled with candy (not so fun going through security on the way home). The staff at the camp was fantastic. We also utilized the in room babysitting service in the evening and were very pleased to see they came with a bag of fun things for the girls to do and it was nice to get out and enjoy an evening with my husband alone. The service is $20 per hour with a 2 hour minimum plus a transportation fee if you are later than 10:00pm. Golf: My husband said it was incredible - he only went to the driving range with my 6 year old daughter (which they provided her with her own kids sized clubs). They were treated like royalty. Service: Our trip would not have been as amazing if it was not for the people at Rosewood who made it very special. It was sad to see how huge the impact of the swine flu had on all of the resorts in that area; it's amazing how the media blows things out of proportion! Even if this hotel was at maximum capacity I feel we would have received the same level and attentiveness from the staff (who by the way love to practice their English as well as give us refreshers on our Spanish). I have to admit, my husband and I were a little confused on what was customary for tipping since there were so many people doing things for us, but we never felt the staff was \"working\" for a tip at any point in time and they were very thankful when they were tipped. It was always a pleasure dealing with each and every staff member and would recommend this resort to anyone.

We hated to see the place with only maybe 15-20% occupancy, but it worked out great for us as guests. We book via our local Virtuoso agent who got us a private VW and Mercedes transfer to/from airport, which was timely and both drivers were great to tell us all about Mexico!

The grounds were always clean and the golf cart service and butlers were awesome. Always talked to you with a smile and so pleasant. While tips were not expected, we tipped 2-3bucks for all rides and tipped 10-15% on top of all meals. Luckily our agent got us free breakfast, so that saved about $200 for the week! The staff and butlers were great and always catered to our needs. I got sunburned on my feet the latter half of the trip (yea I'm a dummy!) and Liliana our afternoon/evening butler came back several times a day to see if I needed anything. Jorge at the Punta Bonita restaurant was a great mngr and made sure we were taken care of always and Erik at Casa Del Lago did the same. I could go on and on about the place, but we really loved it so much. The only \"negative\" items I'd say are (and I use the term loosely): - There is no nightlife on the resort. So after dinner, your on your own. This didn't bother us one bit because we were on our honeymoon and wanted quiet time :) - There are only 2 dinner restaurants & 1 lunch, so by the end of the week, the menus were getting a little old. Definitely recommend venturing off into Playa Del Carmen to check out the local food scene or maybe another nearby resort. - The resort overall is a little on the expensive side for a non-AI, but well worth it.

Airport Pick-Up: Beware of random people that claim they work for Rosewood inside the airport that greet you. They appear friendly, ask you if you need a ride, wear an official uniform - they are there to sell timeshares. Walk outside of the hotel and find a sign with your name on it. Rosewood picked us up in a white shiny Mercedes SUV. Booking a ride from the airport to the hotel with Rosewood is worth not having to deal with the aggravation of other options and allows you to arrive completely relaxed. Reception:The entrance and hotel decor was grand, unique, eco-luxiourious. The service impeccable. The only downside was that the boat that normally takes you to your room never showed up, after waiting for 30 min. I imagine taking a boat to your room is an experience unlike no other. We were greeted with delicious margaritas upon arrival. Room: We booked an ocean front room and I believe this was what really made our experience out of this world. The beach is literally 10 steps from your suite. The plunge pool on the deck allows for private sunbathing. We had breakfast on our deck every morning, and I'm confident that it has had age reversal effects - an amazing breathtaking view of the ocean. No sunsets where the hotel is situated, but apparently great sunrises. Based on our assessment, your experience is based on where your room is located. The lagoon side did not have the same *wow* factor that the ocean side provided. The two areas (lagoon and beach) are also very far apart. The ocean front rooms 603+ would be ideal. you don't really want the room right next to the pool (601) as there wouldn't be too much privacy given the price tag. Service: The butler is a basic waste of time and money (included in your bill as a hotel service charge). No point in tipping this person for smiling at you, and asking if they can do anything for you several times a day. Both times I asked the buttler to do something, she didn't -- but was relentless in her attempt to get a (an additional) tip upon departure. With exception to the butler, overall the service at the hotel is close to perfect - gracious, timely, always anticipating your needs, warm and friendly. Food: Pricey mediocrity. We tried the Mandarin Oriental's restaurant one night and were really pleased. I wouldn't return to the Rosewood's restaurants more than once (for dinner) - try out the neighboring hotels' restaurants. The only meal that is worth mentioning is breafast - make sure you try the waffles (served with chocolate and whipped cream - yum.) Golf / Spa- my husband reported the course to be fantastic - not to be missed. The Spa was divine. The facilities were brand new (plunge pool, jacuzzi, sauna, and steam) and huge. Since we went during the swine flu scare there were barely any other patrons- which really made the experience intimate and relaxing. We've been to other Rosewood properties, e.g. Ventanas in Cabo, and I found this Spa to be better.

As someone on tripadvisor has already stated rosewood mayakoba is basically two resorts , one at the lagoon and one at the beach. From the lagoon it takes about 4:30 minutes with a golf buggy (if it goes directly) to arrive to the beach (add 5 minutes to spot one ..) . This gives the idea of the distance. You can go also by boat but as they only have one it's usually busy somewhere and you can get it only by pure luck. Unfortunately you can only have breakfast at the lagoon so you are forced to take the trip everyday to the lobby. The lobby area is beautiful as the architecture but at this distance from the sea you could be in the everglades or somewhere else . I don't understand why someone wants to go to Rivera Maya to stay so far from the beach . But it seems that all Mayakoba resorts have this marketing idea , expensive rooms far away from the beach or ultraexpensive if you want to see or be on it ( btw mayakoba seems to be a marketing name for a specific tract of rivera maya that seems not be different than anything else there). Don't get me wrong , we are a big fan of Banyan Tree and Mandarin Oriental and have visited many , but it just does not make sense to \"take holiday\" to the beach and end up a mile or more away from it (as someone else mentioned with the mosquitos.. ). And if you choose to be on the beach you end up paying outrageous prices... plus you are away from any other restaurants and forced to eat pretty good , but far from astonishing food. Years ago we where in Jamaica and a local told me Jamaica is far more expensive then Mexico because its \"Jamaica\". Well... times have changed ... Mayakoba seems to be the new ultraexpensive spot. but also this \"bubble\" like the housing bubble will come to and end.", "Date": "April 19, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Connecticut", "Title": "\u201cOtherworldly, surreal, and chic - even with kids!\u201d", "Author": "MTechSolutions", "ReviewID": "UR28335424", "Content": "For a relatively new resort this felt like a mature operation, and the service was quite good, from check-in, grounds tour, our butler, housekeeping, meal servers, concierge, etc. Suites were expansive and luxurious - limestone, glass, mahogany, bamboo...very zen, HUGE, and a private...although numerous complaints about the staff's inability to get their plung pool's temperature adjusted warm enough (ours was like a bath so maybe we lucked out?).

We were there in February during winter break, so the resort was at capacity, with tons of kids - but this is what's so astounding. Never did you feel like you were at the mercy of throngs of screaming kids and their inattentive parents. We spent much of our time at the main pool, and can honestly say 90% of the time I could be in the pool and have it entirely to myself. The kids/families tended to stay near the beach pool. If the main pool area wasn't quiet enough for you, there was yet a third pool on the spa island..also beautiful, but simpler and not quite as stunning as the main pool. Food was very good - just shy of excellent - from the Ceviche/Tequila bar, to the \"casual\" beachfront restaurant, to the more formal main restaurant - every meal was consistently good, and varied. A standout was our Valentine's day dinner - truly memorable, and the pastry chef created a stunning array of chocolate based desserts that were *amazing* - not only in taste and variety, but in presentation.

Fabulous Service. Best on Riviera Maya.\u201d", "Author": "mburgener", "ReviewID": "UR28145799", "Content": "Overview: My wife, three year-old daughter and I just returned from seven days/six nights at the Rosewood Mayakoba. We stayed in one of the Beachfront Suites situated directly on the beach just steps from the ocean (the sand runs up to our patio). I had originally reserved a Deluxe Lagoon View Suite so that we would have a separate living area for our daughter and could save serious $$$ each night. As the trip approached, I realized nothing could beat a beachfront room. I had emailed the Rosewood Mayakoba several times to inquire about the rooms, upgrading, car service, etc. On each occasion, I received a response the same day. I knew this place was going to be top-service and something special. Airport Pickup: I arranged via email with the Rosewood to pick us up from the airport. We were met with a brand new Cadillac Escalade with Rosewood branding outside the airport (watch out, you'll get plenty of folks try to convince you they are Rosewood looking to take your business inside). We just marched out front and found the sign with our name. They had a car seat already in the SUV for our daughter. They had bottled water and cool wet towels. The drive was fairly short (less than 45mins). The entrance to Rosewood is shared amongst all of the Mayakoba resorts (Fairmont, Banyan Tree, Viceroy, Rosewood and el Cameleon PGA Golf Course). It is quite stunning. Check-in: Check-in was quick and we were greeted with a Margarita and taken to our room via a boat. The lagoon was beautiful and really felt like nothing I\u2019ve ever experienced. They had everything confirmed including the room upgrade. We just had a hold/deposit put on my AMEX (which I will expand upon later) and off we went. The Room: If we had any reservation (no pun intended) about upgrading to the beachfront suite, it disappeared once the door to our room was opened. Holy cow! It was like something out of Casino Royale. The bright blue of the ocean filled the entire sliding windows! What a view! Be sure you have polarized sunglasses. I joked that they should be required to really see all of the ocean colors, but seriously, BRING POLARIZED SUNGLASSES! The tradeoff with the Beachfront Suite is that you don\u2019t have a truly separate living room for a third guest. We had a pull out couch that was our daughter\u2019s bed. For us, it was a non-issue as we were all pretty wiped in the evenings. The bathroom was large and the circular tile tub with full windows to a private outside garden were wonderful. The only three (relatively minor) room issues were: 1) no real drawer clothing space \u2013 we had closet shelves instead. We ended up having plenty of room, but I was looking for a dresser and realized there wasn\u2019t one; 2) the internet in the room was spotty. I think it might have been because we were on the beach, but I didn\u2019t get access everywhere in the room. I never complained about this because I really didn\u2019t want to surf the internet on this trip. I suspect if I had complained, they would have fixed it; 3) the TV controller is wonky. I couldn\u2019t get the standard remote to work, so I had to resort to a full keyboard with mouse buttons. Again, I only watched Master\u2019s golf on Thursday, so it was no big deal. They knew we had a three year old with us and had a bowl of gummy bears out on the coffee table. They had a small robe and slippers for her as well. The Resort: The Rosewood Mayakoba really felt like two resorts: you had the beach rooms/pool/restaurant and you had the lagoon rooms/pool/restaurants. We experienced everything at the resort, but found we spent the majority of our time at the beach. I\u2019m not sure what the split would have been had we stayed in a Lagoon Suite up near the lobby. At the end of the trip, we asked our daughter what her favorite thing was and she quickly said, \u201cThe golf carts\u201d. Golf carts are shuttles that take you from the beach to the lagoon/lobby area. It is a quick, three minute ride and it is beautiful. It is really not a bad walk (we did that several times too), but for kids, the cart is a hit. She would ride in the very back, facing backwards with my wife. During our stay, I would venture to guess it was only 40-60% full. It was definitely busier by the end of the week. But it was wonderful to never wait for a table, never feel crowded in the pools or on the beach, never wait for a person to take/bring you a drink order. The Employees: My words can\u2019t do justice to describe how wonderful the staff at the Rosewood was. Flawless. Friendly. Welcoming. I can\u2019t even remember all of their names, but folks like Armando, Ed, Elizabeth, Jorge, Angel, Eduardo, J.C..they were so sincere (or great actors). They really tried to remember your name. They always greeted you with a smile. They frequently asked you if everything was exactly as you wanted it to be. They were one of my favorite parts of this entire trip. I have never been to a resort/hotel that had this consistently high quality service. Not even a Four Seasons. Again, this is personal preference. But they were just wanted I needed. They anticipated your moves but also recognized if you desired privacy. The turndown service was a great example of the attention to detail. They were thrown for a curveball the first night because we were in bed so early (due to 2 hour time difference and having a little one). The next night, when we were off to dinner at 5:30, they had adjusted their schedule. We came back to the room and it was all ready for bed. The couch was out and our daughter\u2019s pig was tucked under the covers. All of her toys were arranged in a straight line on the floor or on tables. Her books were stacked. A new bookmark was in my wife\u2019s book. Clothes were folded. Bottles of water added throughout the room. One day we noticed a faint smell in the room. They came out, fixed it, and that night, with turn down service, they were burning a candle in the bathtub. The Food: I will keep this short. The long and short is that we were pleasantly surprised with the food for two reasons: 1) it was good and 2) it was not as expensive as I thought it would be. For breakfast you have two options \u2013 the lobby restaurant or room service. The lobby restaurant has an amazing buffet with hot items to order. It is $26 per person. Be sure to drink the \u201cverde\u201d green juice. It is fabulous. They have a kids menu and if your kid likes fries, you\u2019ll be all set \uf04a. If you want to save some money, get a continental breakfast delivered to your room. For lunch, you have the lobby restaurant, the beach restaurant and room service. The key note is that portions are fairly large for lunch. You can easily split items for two people. We ate primarily at the beach restaurant the entire trip (except for breakfast up at the lobby restaurant). For dinner, you have the lobby, the pool restaurant and you have a sushi/tequila bar (along with room service). We had all of them and split our time with the pool restaurant, room service, once at the tequila bar and once at the Fairmont. The sushi was fun and they made a quesadilla for our daughter. If you eat dinner at the beach restaurant, be sure to order the chocolate cake. It is made to order with a hot chocolate filling with vanilla ice cream. Don\u2019t say I didn\u2019t warn you! In general, I think we averaged about $400-$450 a day total on food/drinks for three of us. The one time we ventured off the resort was to the Fairmont for dinner. It was good, but at $300, it was not that good \uf04a. Service charges/tips are included in all meals. We would leave another 10% on top of that. We tended to tip for towels and we tipped the golf cart guy. It didn\u2019t seem like most were doing so, but it just felt right given the quality of the place. I think we ended up spending about $400 on tips for the entire week (including cleaning service, etc). They can make change for you at the lobby. The Beach: I really loved the Riviera Maya beach. It wasn\u2019t perfect, but it was good enough. The water was beautiful but wasn\u2019t the clearest you\u2019d find elsewhere (because there were some waves). There were rock patches here and there, but were easy to see in the water (dark spots on the bottom). The temperature was great and I really enjoyed swimming along the coastline each day with my goggles. They groomed the beach each morning with a tractor. The sand was soft and clean. I miss it dearly \uf04a Thoughts about the other resorts: My wife and I spent some time looking at the other resorts along Riviera Maya. In the end, I think I would still go back to Rosewood before trying out one of the others. Here are some quick thoughts: Mandarin Oriental \u2013 this resort is slightly north of Rosewood. It\u2019s beachfront suites look amazing and also feel isolated like Rosewood. But they are considerably more expensive. The pool is up higher on the hill, so it doesn\u2019t feel like it is on the beach. The beachfront area just felt underwhelming. I heard the food is great but very expensive. Net \u2013 It didn\u2019t feel much better for likely a lot more money. Fairmont Mayakoba \u2013 this resort was packed \u2013 I heard nearly to capacity. Here are the issues I had with it: 1) not to sound snobby, but the Fairmont tries to appeal to all people. They have rooms priced from $400 to $2000+. You are going to get very different people at those price points. It definitely showed on the beach. And it was crowded. The other issue was with the beachfront suites. They looked amazing. Except they were on the main strip of beach, which mean you looked out onto a sea of umbrellas and people ruining your view. It really is a big oversight in my mind. The beach pool was unspectacular and relatively small. On the plus side, the beachfront restaurant had an amazing view and the food was pretty good. Banyan Tree Mayakoba \u2013 this resort had just opened. It was pretty empty and the only beachfront rooms were 3 bedroom villas for CRAZY $$$ per night. What stuck out in my mind was two things: - the chairs on the beach were the strangest thing I\u2019ve ever seen. They were covered in dark blue cloth with weird foam triangles for backs. Dark cloths in the hot sun? They were the weirdest thing I\u2019ve ever seen. The pool was also really small, but it did have a swim up bar. I think that would be a novelty for a day and then would never get used. No one was using it. Grand Velas \u2013 this resort was also brand new. It had a spectacular beach pool. We\u2019re talking the size of a football field. But it just felt like a HUGE hotel. It was definitely nice. Nice like the Fairmont Kea Lani in Maui. But it just felt cookie-cutter and huge. The beach was horrible in front of Grand Velas. There was a natural reef barrier that was ugly as sin. And the beach itself was ungroomed, very deep and really packed hard. Would have been really disappointed with this beach. All of the others were about equal and beautiful. Viceroy \u2013 construction has stopped and there are only concrete frames of beachfront buildings. I wouldn\u2019t invest in that one for some time! Miscellaneous Items: El Cameleon was a great course in immaculate condition. No one was there, so my 7AM tee time took only 2 hours. $220 is a bit steep, but it was fun to place once. My wife had a massage at the Sense Spa and loved it. She compared it to our local Ballantyne Resort in Charlotte and said it was much better. Final Thoughts/Tips: We would definitely go back again. I am torn as to whether I would try a lagoon room just to change things up. It would be hard to not be on the beach. Man, that beachfront room was something else. We would sit out in the plunge pool on our patio drinking wine and watching the people pass by. I filmed the ocean at sunrise and in the middle of the day, just so I could play it back at home in HD. Paying \u2013 please note that if you were planning to pay with your AMEX card, first check exchange rates. For some reason, AMEX had Rosewood charge you in Pesos. This exposes you to exchange rate fluctuations. With Visa you can be billed in Dollars. I mention this because during our stay, everything was quoted with a 14.5 pesos to the dollar exchange rate. At checkout, the current exchange rate was 13 pesos to the dollar (I checked the WSJ). So, here is the tip \u2013 if the pesos to the dollar (actual) is higher than the exchange rate quoted on your folio, pay with AMEX and/or request to be billed in Pesos. If the pesos to the dollar (actual)is lower than the exchange rate quoted in your folio, pay with a VISA card and request to be billed in dollars. You could save yourself nearly $1000 dollars. Feel free to send me some of your savings to my Paypal account. I will upload pics when I can, and I have a few videos, including one from the beach to the lagoons. I will post when I can. Feel free to email me with questions.

Arrival: We were met outside customs/baggage by the hotels driver and our private transfer to the hotel, so worth it ($115/one way). He had cold towels and water for us and quickly loaded us and our bags into the suv for our 30 minute drive to the hotel. Upon arrival, they greeted us by name and our deluxe lagoon suites were ready, it was 11 am and that was a surprise. The deluxe lagoon suite (room 308) was amazing, marble throughout, large sitting area, king bed, dressing area, 2 full baths, outdoor shower, roof top deck and plunge pool with loungers. Our room was cleaned each day and each evening we had turn down service. The last night they ran a bath for us with candles and roses (we didnt go in, but still a nice thought). Also a welcome bottle of don julio tequila in the room, which was replenished each day, and the fiji bottled water was complimentary. I did not think that the mini bar prices were obscene. The food, we ate at the main lobby restaurant for breakfast each day, it was great a full buffet and then items off the menu, the banana bread was great. The restaurant at the beach, for lunch was terrific, what we would do is order our food from the beach and once the food was ready they would let us know and we would then get up and go to sit down. I highly recommend the fajitas and lobster tacos. The breakfast and lunch were excellent, no complaints. Dinners: The first night we stayed at the rosewood for dinner and it was really nice, i have to say, the service here was so good. We ate at the Mandarin Oriental twice, the high end restaurant amber was very good, would go back even at $250, the other restaurant aqua marina was terrible, the food was eh, the service was slow and no ambiance, it was like a cafeteria room dressed up a little. We also ate at the Fairmont, it was ok, wouldnt go back, and one night we went into playa del carmen and ate at yatche (8st and 5th ave), recommended by the hotel, this was authentic mexican and very good, with apps, entree and drinks it was $44/couple, nice compared to the hotel pricing!!! The Beach and beach pool, we all got to the beach by 10:30am each day and never had a problem getting 6 chairs on the sand or around the pool. The pool was great, a nice way to cool off, it was refreshing even had an adjoining childrens pool. The service at the beach was fabulous, there was never more than a minute to attract someones attention for food or drinks. Gabriel, Manuel, Adrian and Daniel are so nice and very friendly. at different intervals during the day Elizabeth would come around with complimentary smoothies, sorbet, frozen grapes and cucumber/cold towel eye treatments. The Spa, we all had massages, the facilities at the spa were great, sauna, steam, cold plunge, hot tub, etc it was great. The massages were wonderful, each in private cottages surrounding the spa. The gym was adequate, we used the eliptical machines, and they had a circuit and some dumbells. Getting around, the boat that they take you from check in to your room was a nice touch, although we never used the boat again. each morning we would walk to the main lobby for breakfast and then take the golf carts to and from the beach. We did walk to the beach occasionally but the carts were everywhere and never had to wait more than a couple of minutes. The hotel was 50% full from what they told us and with only 110 suites, we never felt that it was crowded. Our stay overlapped part of Easter week, there was some kids around, but never bothered us, they were all well behaved. The hotel also had a martini night and tequila tasting and at each, we were the only ones at the bars.

I read in a post before I left that someone had slipped and I thought they were just being silly.

Don\u2019t get me wrong, Ikal was terrific, but the Rosewood was even better. The hotel is situated in the Mayakoba complex, which is absolutely breathtaking. The complex consists of three other resorts (Fairmont, Banyan Tree and Viceroy), however, we believe that Rosewood will distinguish itself as the premiere property in this complex. In support of this belief, the owners of Mayakoba have chosen to build their private residence (a three bedroom presidential suite located on an island in the lagoons) at the Rosewood hotel. We were told that it can be rented for $6k/night in the high season. We find it very compelling that the owners selected Rosewood given that they most likely could have chosen to build their pad in any hotel or location in Mayakoba. The hotel staff is clearly this hotel\u2019s greatest asset, as everyone we encountered was extremely warm, polite and helpful. While there were a few minor lapses, we attributed those to the growing pains that the resort is still experiencing as it works to fine tune its service to the highest level. ROOM: We had a lagoon villa in the 400s, and it was probably one of the nicest hotel rooms we\u2019ve ever stayed in. The room was very spacious and immaculate, with terrific lighting. The bathroom was in a class by itself, complete with Mexican travertine marble, two large showers (one indoors, the other outdoors), a huge soaking tub, private WC and dual sinks. Hats off to Rosewood for using large, refillable containers for the toiletries instead of tiny plastic bottles that usually get tossed after only one use. The outdoor patio was spacious and the private heated plunge pool was always clean and inviting. It was really neat to be able to watch cormorants land on our dock while swimming only a few feet away. Our butler was terrific and always available if we needed anything. He usually made our dinner reservations for us, prepared a farewell bath for us, complete with rose petals and candles, and made sure our favorite Nespresso pods were refilled daily. Truly wonderful. Suggestions about the room? We had to request a DVD player, which seemed a little odd given the plethora of other amenities already in the room. We think that at this price point, a DVD player should be a standard feature in every room (as was the case in Ikal). Rosewood might also want to invest in room sensors to help housekeeping keep track of when you\u2019re in and when you\u2019re out (again, like Ikal). A few times, we ran into housekeeping as they were finishing up and on another occasion, they left a note that we would need to call them if we wanted turn down service as our privacy sign was on (it was only 6:30 p.m.). That\u2019s a bit early for turndown service. GROUNDS: The property is gorgeous. The online photos really don\u2019t do it justice. The landscaping and plantings are sublime and the property is lovingly cared for. The property is also very large, so the hotel offers frequent shuttle service, or you can take a boat through the lagoons and mangroves to get around. We took the boat once at check-in and again for our tour of the property (complete with birds and baby crocodiles). Wonderful! But for most of the time, we choose to walk on the many pathways so we could soak in the balmy weather and appreciate the exotic setting. POOLS: In addition to the plunge pool on our patio, the hotel has three other pools. There is one at the spa (which is hardly used), one next to the lobby (called \u201cAlberca\u201d) and one at the beach. While the Alberca pool looked perfect, we never used it as it was next to the lobby and not near the beach. We are beach folks, so if we chose to swim in a pool after our daily visit to the beach, we used the one on our patio. The beach pool was great (albeit a tad smaller than Alberca), with post card views of the sea. There are cabanas (free) and plenty of chairs and umbrellas. The service is very attentive, and cold treats are passed out during the day. The staff will adjust your umbrella as the sun moves without even having to ask. They also will set you up with a complimentary bottle of water on ice when you arrive and serve you lunch or snacks throughout the day from the beach restaurant. Our only complaint was one day, upon return from our beach stroll, a staff member had moved our chairs slightly and was in the process of giving our umbrella away to accommodate other guests sitting next to us. When questioned, he immediately rushed to get us another umbrella but never apologized. This left a bad taste in our mouths since 1) we weren\u2019t gone that long, and 2) if he could find another umbrella for us, why couldn\u2019t he have given that one to the other guests and left ours where it was? I am very conscious about hotels being concerned about guests reserving lounge chairs and never using them, but clearly this was not the case. We should be able to swim in the ocean or take a leisurely stroll without fear of our chairs or umbrella being given away. The service on the other days made up for this incident so we just chalked it up to an inexperienced staff member. BEACH: The beach is great, however, during the first couple of days of our stay, the sea was a bit rough and the water was filled with seaweed. By the third day, it had calmed down and the water was clean and clear. The sand is like sugar, although depending upon where you enter to swim will determine just how smooth the bottom is. Some places were rockier than others, so we needed to feel around to find the perfect spot. The beach extends for quite a ways in both directions, allowing you to walk by the other hotels in Mayakoba as well as other hotels along the strip. One of the highlights of our day was our morning walk up and down the coast. Not to be missed! SPA: In a word, amazing. The facility is gorgeous, ultra-chic and very clean. The Swiss showers and Elemis products are a match made in heaven. The treatments were excellent and many start off with a special foot cleanse/massage. We highly recommend a visit to the spa, even if the prices were a bit steep. RESTAURANTS: We ate at both restaurants but preferred Punta Bonita at the beach over Casa del Lago at the lobby. Having said that, however, the breakfast at Casa del Lago was superb and should not be missed. In addition to a wonderful menu selection (which included both American and Mexican specialties), the restaurant offered a bountiful buffet with delicious produce, charcuterie and freshly made cheeses, along with other tasty offerings. As much as we longed to have breakfast on our patio, we always opted to walk over to the lobby and have our breakfast there with our usual server, who was great. Our dinner at Casa del Lago started with some very good appetizers but ended with lackluster entrees and dessert. At Punta Bonita, the fare is Mexican and the grill selections were freshly prepared and very flavorful. We enjoyed the food and the dining experience there so much, we ate dinner there a second time. During our days poolside, we also ordered from Punta Bonita. Again, the food was great, however, one afternoon they ran out of guacamole at 12:30, and the drinks were better some days than others. Again, the overall experience was first rate, but we attributed these slight imperfections to food and beverage management that hasn\u2019t quite mastered the art of five star resort dining. We hope that by our next visit, such foibles will be a distant, faded memory \u2013 especially at these prices. We did eat off the premises one evening and the concierge arranged the entire affair, and even had menus for us to review to help us make our selection. What\u2019s more, the hotel sent us to town in their Mercedes SUV (for a fee) and returned to pick us up when we finished \u2013 very classy! SERVICE: The hotel staff made our stay at Rosewood. They always went out of our way to make us feel special and right at home. While this hotel is blessed with many assets, natural and otherwise, this is clearly their ace in the hole. By the second day of our stay, many staff members recognized us and called us by our names. We felt as if we had been going there for years. FINAL NOTES: While we loved the lagoon view from our room (and the privacy of our corner location) folks should be note that these rooms are quite a ways from the ocean. If you must have an ocean view, or wish to be a stone\u2019s throw from it, you should consider reserving the oceanview or beachfront rooms. The beachfront rooms were particularly nice as they were located directly on the sand. Honestly, I can\u2019t say that they were worth twice the price of a lagoon villa, but they looked quite lovely. As we suggested in the comment card, the hotel needs to add a little nightlife. A nice touch would be some live entertainment at the lobby in the evening a few nights a week. Also, once a week there should be a Mexican/seafood gourmet barbecue at the beach restaurant, complete with live music and folkloric dancing. Mexico has such a rich and diverse culture, it\u2019s really a shame for guests not to be offered this experience, a la Rosewood. At Ikal, the weekly barbecue was the highlight of our stay. Others have said that this hotel should be \u201cadults only\u201d but quite frankly, I think it worked very well as both a couples and family resort. There were children here and there, but they were never rowdy or in the way. The place is large enough to accommodate everyone and if you choose to make this a couples only getaway (as we did this time), you will find it very easy to have peace and quiet. We can\u2019t wait to visit here again and hope to bring our little son with us.

I could not have been more happy with our stay at the Rosewood; I would say without question the nicest hotel I have ever stayed in....by far! My wife and 2 girls (5,3) had a great time and will definitely be returning. The following is an analysis of our experience with the hotel. Check-In When we drove into the property with our rental car, the valet already knew our names and promptly unloaded our luggage and directed us to the front desk. Cecelia at check-in was very friendly, helpful and efficient. Within minutes we were led to a boat that took us to our lagoon view suite. Cold towels and fresh fruit on the brief boat ride made the ride even more pleasurable. Room I can't say enough about the design, and uniqueness of the hotel rooms. From the large plunge pool, to the indoor/outdoor shower, the extra large soaker tub, the rooftop area; everything was thoughtfully designed and executed with the highest level of craftsmanship and finish. We were impressed that they had provided two pink robes, two pairs of kids slippers, and small clothes hangers for my two girls. Within minutes of our arrival our morning butler, Alba arrived and gave us a tour of the room and even offered to unpack our clothes and offer to set up a bubble bath for the kids whenever we needed. There was also a nice bottle of tequila and fresh fruit available upon our arrival. Pillows, mattress, comforters made it seem like you could sleep for days. Food We had lunch and the Breakfast at the main restaurant and felt the food to be above average. The breakfast buffet entrees were prepared fresh rather than sitting in large serving containers. More seafood options would have been better. We also had room service a few times and were impressed with the quality of the food and service both times. The fish tacos at the beach restaurant were amazing. I really didn't find the prices too different than what a typical buffet breakfast, or an average lunch would cost in the US. Beach The sand was soft and free of seaweed and rocks. It was not crowded at all, no mechanized water vehicles, no vendors on the beach selling their wares. The way I like it. Kids Club We dropped the kids there a few hours each day. There is no fee for this service and no time limit either. Regina did a wonderful job entertaining the kids. Each day they have a schedule of activities where the kids enjoyed doing crafts. Best kids club facilities and activities ever. Pools The main pool was rarely used. The water seemed a bit colder than the beach pool. Plenty of beach chairs available at both pools. The beach pool was smaller but never crowded. They have pool/beach toys available for children. Pool service was prompt and attentive but not over the top where they are constantly in your face. Spa My wife had a facial at the spa which she absolutely loved. I used the spa facilities to relax. I had the entire mens' spa area to myself every time I was there. It seemed in general that the hotel was not that busy..whether it was due to an eroding economy or just the time of year, I guess it certainly worked in our favor. Getting around Golf carts were never more than a 5 minute wait to take you to the different parts of this vast resort. We did walk to the beach one time and it was not more than a 10 minute walk. There are also boats that can take you around but it is slower. We did take up an offer by the boat driver to take us on a boat tour where he showed us some of the wildlife in the area (fish, crocodiles, turtles, birds etc.) which the kids loved. Golf I was able to book a twilight tee time at El Camaleon for 130usd which is a steal considering the caliber of golf course. The course was in pristine condition likely because they are hosting a PGA event in a few weeks. It was cart path only so I actually had to do some walking ;) It would have been a great round had it not been for the torrential rains that started midway into the round and lasted an hr. Check out The morning of check out the reception called to see if they can send a butler over to help us pack. Check out was prompt and the incidental charges were accurate. Overall Impression I believe the true measure of great service is where the staff can anticipate your needs and take the initiative to provide for you promptly and efficiently rather than simply asking you \"is everything ok or what can I do for you?\" I think the Rosewood executed this perfectly. While yes, the resort is expensive compared to others, you get what you pay for. I found they didn't nickel and dime us when we were there. Wireless internet is free and available throughout the resort. Bottled water is free from your room. Exercise and spa facilities are free for all guests. There is no fee for the kids club. At 3 times what I paid for for a 4 star hotel in Cancun, I actually thought the Rosewood was a much better value for what you get. If you are looking for the ultimate in relaxing vacation, look no further. If you are looking for more of a party atmosphere, go to Cancun. My only regret was \"wasting\" 4 days in Cancun before heading to the Rosewood. Travel tip.....do NOT drive in Cancun. There are corrupt policeman everywhere. We got pulled over for no reason at all and was told that the only way to get my license back was to pay 100 usd. I was able to negotiate down to 30. You wont likely be able drive 2 miles in Cancun without seeing someone pulled over.

When beginning our search for a place to take his Executive team and their spouses for a reward retreat, we chose the newly opened Rosewood Mayakoba. My husband and I traveled to Mayakoba in February 2008 to check things out and meet with the event planner. Although the spa had not opened nor had all the rooms been finished, we we pleasantly surprised at how smoothly things ran. We stayed in one of the beach villas and thoroughly enjoyed the room, plunge pool and decor. The housekeeping service was incredible. The laundry service delivers your clothes on special hangers and your folded laundry in the neatest little basket. Nice touch.... If you stay on the beach, you will either walk to the lobby area, take a golf cart shuttle or ride in the shuttle boat. The boat ride is a fun experience. We were met when we arrived at the resort with a drink and small hors d'oeuvres on our boat ride to the beach via the lagoon. The shuttles run constantly so you almost never have to call one. The restaurant on the beach called Punta Bonita was our favorite. Some of the best fresh fish tacos I've ever eaten....don't forget to ask for the roasted pumpkin seed dip (earthly flavor like you have never experienced). Service was always A+. The Casa del Lago was very nice also...located right next to the lobby and main pool. The sommelier suggested a delicious Spanish wine that was the best! Food is pricier here than the other restaurant, but really good! Next to the restaurant is a glass enclosed room where you can check out the available wines and Cuban cigars. A great afternoon spot is Agave Azul Raw Bar & Tequila Library...and I mean library. Every kind of tequila you can imagine. All there for the tasting. Fresh seafood tapas style with a freshly made margarita will set your hair on fire! WOW! Our scouting mission in February 2008 was a success. Our event planner, Tulio, had everything ready for our 28 guests in April 2008. There were a few small hiccups, but all in all our April trip was just as we planned. I received thank you notes from all the guests saying it was the best and most relaxing 5 days they have spent away in a long time. \"Over the top\" was how most described the experience. All the ladies and some of the men visited the spa and raved about the experience. Tranquil, attentive and worth every moment were some of the words used to describe the spa by our group.

The rooms are beautiful and done in a modern rustic style. No two rooms are completely alike. Other reviewers have detailed how beautiful the rooms are and that it's tempting just to hang out in your room without venturing out anywhere since you have a plunge pool and deck. This is very true. Our room came with butler service and some tequila, coffee and fruit, gratis. This gave the check-in a hospitable, luxurious feeling. Arrivals during the day are brought to their room by a boat using the lagoon but at night you are transported by one of the many golf carts. Riding in the boats in the lagoon is quite a beautiful experience itself. Also, the beach was clean and well groomed. Mosquitoes--this was not that much of a bother to us. They have a sprayer go around in the evenings. Also, they are only really active at dawn and dusk (which is actually better than where we live in southeast texas). I just would recommend you not leave your doors open at night even though the night air can be quite delicious. Service--As other reviewers have noted, it's spectacular. All the workers at the property appear happy and said they felt adequately compensated for their work when I asked. Most speak pretty good english but all are happy to help you work on your spanish. We were unobtrusively pampered the whole time. Food--We quite liked the fine dining restaurant. The more informal restaurant and tequila/ceviche bar were also great. The variety seemed better than what some other reviewers prepared me for. Ingredients were always fresh and of top quality. We have a Caribbean lobster stew in the fine restaurant which was served majorcan style, thickened with olive oil instead of butter and was awesome. We also saw the interior of the kitchens during our stay. They are immaculate. The chef appears ready to accommodate any kind of allergy or special diet (if we return with our children, my son has allergies to dairy, nuts and eggs). The wine list is good but be forewarned that mexican tariffs effect the prices significantly compared to the US. Spa--the spa was beautiful and had a nice workout room. It is on an island in the lagoon. The prices in the spa, as mentioned in other reviews, are considerably more than what you might pay at home. A 90 minute massage was over $200. Because of lack of time when not on vacation, we went ahead and had some treatments. The massage was good but not on the level of some other hotel spas I could recommend (for example, Four Seasons Chicago, ZaZa Houston). Overall, it's a beautiful facility with pretty good service that could still raise the bar a little bit. Overall, my wife and I agreed this was probably about the finest hotel of its size we've ever stayed in. The prices were not much different than some other places we have stayed--even in the spa. Rosewood Mayakoba is not cheap but it is a place where you actually get what you pay for. This hotel appears to nestle into and showcase the mangroves and natural beauty of the area as opposed to towering above it.

The resort itself is beautiful and extremely unique -- unlike any we've seen given the way the rooms are built around lagoons and one can get around in a duffy boat. The spa was the highlight for us. If you are looking for a warm, tropical vacation with a good workout and spa facility, then this is your spot. Yoga every morning on the beach was wonderful; the spa pool is open to ALL guests, not just those who book spa appointments. It's big enough for laps and stayed open till 9pm (I believe), so we'd often cap off our day with a workout and evening laps before heading to dinner. I can't say enough about how great the spa facility was -- truly the highlight of the trip. Here are the \"kinks\" that we know are able to be overcome and would not prevent us from going back. Just beware before going -- 1) the food at the hotel was a disappointment and left a lot of guests scratching their heads. The Mexican fare did not seem authentic but more like something we'd get from a high-end Mexican restaurant in NYC and the main restaurant was very high-end European. Nice but odd given the surroundings, 2) there was a big group event when we were there. The hotel did not know how the handle the massive size of events and often closed down parts of the resort without telling the other guests. So for example, on the weekly itinerary, it would say \"mariachi band on Tuesday night.\" We'd plan to attend only to find out the bar area was closed and the event was canceled given the group. Something they can work through with better communication. Finally two other points worth noting that are not the resort's issue: 1) This is not the best beach we've ever seen. It's representative of what you'll get in this region; however, if you're looking for the quintessential Caribbean blue / glass water, you won't find it here, and 2) The town of Playa del Carmen is not worth a ton of your time. Assume you'll spend most of your evenings at the hotel or visiting other hotel restaurants/bars.

The suite has a porch that leads to a staircase that leads to a rooftop sundeck and then to a plunge pool, 4 feet deep and about 6 by 12 in length. This pool is heated. Our view overlooked the Caribbean but on the other side we could see the lagoons and mangroves. In the mangroves we saw an eagle, baby crocodiles, cormorants, and an iguana or too. We loved our suite and the one critique that we had was that it was hard to get it well lit at night in some areas. The resort is very large and spread out, though easily walkable. We generally walked to the reception area for the breakfast each day and usually had golf carts go by us offerering us rides. Its a nice walk, so we usually declined except at night when we were tired or if in a hurry (which was rare). The staff are lovely, and seem to take great pride in the resort. I asked one buggy driver how long he had worked there, and he answered that he started 4 months before it opened. He had helped get the place ready for business and felt a particular pride in it because of this. The beach pool and beach were where most people hung out during the day. The main pool was really dead, though this may change during the holidays when the resort is busier. I think that the economy is taking its toll as the resort was not very full. Food: The breakfast at casa del lago was excellent. There is a buffet with breads, bagels, smoked salmon and trout, cheese, yoghurt, juices, mueseli, cereals, panckakes, waffles, and some other assorted choices. Also included was an made to order hot item which included the usual eggs and omelettes, fruits (which are also on the buffet and of very high quality) and some Mexican choices, which is what I usually opted for. They were very flavorful, and servous was excellent. The buffet was $26 plus 15% service charge and tax. We usually took lunch by the pool or at Punta Bonita (same menu) and found the selections very tastey. Margaritas were excellent (repeatedly). I didn't see the menu at Casa del Lago, but I did peak at the spa menu and wasn't impressed. The beach was nice, not crowded, and although small, the water was beautiful. The service was excellent. There are kayaks and sailboats that you can use, free of charge and the lifeguard will take you out snorkling in a kayak, though the local reef is very small and a bit disappointing. You really need to take a tour to see the best undersea life. The kayaking was fun though and good exercise. Most places charge for such a service, but at the Rosewood, it was offered with a smile. Casa del Lago for dinner was uneven. My wife loved her tuna tartar and lamb, but I found my lobster disappointing. We had made a reservation prior to arrival and indicated that it was for our fifth anniversary, and we were shocked that they didn't have our reservation. None the less there were plenty of tables. We didn't mention our anniversary to any of the staff that evening, but they somehow got wind of this and sent over a glass of champagne and wrote happy anniversary on our desert. They also sent another desert to our room with Happy Anniversary written on it but we were so full that we didn't eat it until the next morning. I loved dinner at Punta Bonita. The restaurant has multiple small appetizers that you share and then you chose from a steak or seafood. I guess you could easily make a meal from the appetizers as well. They were outstanding. It was, I understand, a new menu, and any complaint about bland food in the earlier reviews I would dismiss at this point. It was some of the best mexican food that I have ever had. I was particularly fond of the duck tacos with tamarind mole sauce. The Tequila bar and tequila tasting was terrific. I highly recommend this, and the ceviches could easily make a meal (this is what we did our first night). We were a little disappointed in the spa. It was beautiful and peacefull. I loved the locker room with its sauna, steam room, salt scrub and showers. I found the locker room elegant, but my wife found it affected. It was also too dark for her to easily put on make up before dinner (we are in our forties, so I hope that doesn't mean that were are getting old). The communications between the staff and ourselves were not always acurate and lead to some anxiety over what we were getting and paying for. This detracted a little from the overall relaxation that the spa was designed for. We did the Escape Together Deluxe, which consisted of a private yoga lesson (TJ was a very effective teacher who was able to deal with us novices without making us feel...totally inadequate), a massage which was very good, followed by a bath and then a facial. I highly recommend this, but it was very expensive. The gym was well equipped. The spa and gym facilities were all included with the room. The spa pool was empty when we were there and as mentioned by another reviewer is a great place to do laps. The spa Cenote was not open to swimming, but I am not sure if that was just at the time we were there. We went into Playa del Carmen one night, a 4 mile cab ride which costs $18 into town and $15 back to the resort. We also added a small tip. We ate at Yaxche and I thought that it was quite nice. One inexplicable faux pas was that we booked round trip transportation in a mercedes at $260 round trip and were instead sent in a ford SUV. The ride was pleasant and comfortable so it was fine, but less elegant. The SUV should have been $30 cheaper, but the resort didn't seem to adjust the rate. Given that they upgraded us to a room that was substantially more expensive, I didn't ask for the $30 difference back, but it was just odd, and part of the few communication issues which I don't think that they have quite worked out. There have been a few reviewers commenting on mosquitos or no mosquitos. We were slightly bitten up on our ankles, but it was really minor. I suspect that it is very weather dependent. Overall, we loved this resort, the staff, and would not hesitate to come back and recommend it highly.", "Date": "December 10, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "sc", "Title": "\u201cgreat resort\u201d", "Author": "bcw7777", "ReviewID": "UR22592283", "Content": "We just returned from the resort, and had a wonderul stay.

The suite has its own heated plunge pool, and a private terrace roof. The outdoor shower was my favorite, and the two flat screen televisions were nice. Overall, the suite was great. The resort is very large compared to its sister property, which we stay at last year, Las Ventanas. The resort has three pools. One pool is located near the reception. This pool is much quieter during the day, than the beach pool, but both are nice. The two restaurants are good. We had spa treatments, and they were very nice, but expensive. I played golf at El Cameleon. The course was in very good condition, and not very busy, but for 215.00, they could have given me a ball more or a divot tool.

We had very high expectations and I was nervous that the resort wouldn't live up to them, but it did and exceeded what we imagined! We would highly recommend this resort to anyone travelling to the area. Lagoon Part of the Resort (Casa del Lago) - The main reception, Formal Restaurant, Games Room, Tequila Library, and Spa are located by the Lagoon. This part of the resort is very beautiful, especially in the evenings. The restaurant at Casa del Lago was more formal and served mostly Euorpean dishes for dinner. The buffet breakfasts were real feasts - the prix fixe includes both the buffet and dish from their a la carte menu. It may be a bit expensive though unless you have a big appetite and can take advantage of all they have to offer. The service at the Casa del Lago restaruant was excellent and the dinners we had there were really good. The pool at Casa del Lago is bigger and prettier than the pool at the beach but was almost always empty as it's not on the ocean, and the service at the beach was quicker. Beach Part of the Resort - Guests can get to the Beach section of the resort by either taking a golf cart or by taking a boat through the mangroves. We highly recommend the boat ride if you have 10mins... it's relaxing and there are lots of birds and baby crocodiles you can check out on the way. The restaurant at the beach (Punta Bonita) focussed on Mexican cuisine and I think we preferred it over the one at Casa del Lago. The pool side lunch service was great, and the staff would also come around with complimentary sorbets, fresh fruit juice, frappachinos, and evian mists when it was really hot. The beach loungers were very comfy and the cabanas were great when we needed a break from the sun. Suite - We stayed in a Beach side Ocean View Suite (the ones that overlook the Beach Front Suites) which was fantastic. Since we were at the resort for a long time we wanted a suite with lots of room and we got it - big entry hall, separate living room, enormous bathroom with terrace, another terrace off the living room overlooking the Ocean with table and chairs, and a great rooftop sun deck with private plunge pool, two loungers, and one large circular couch/lounger, that we used every day. Also there were no bugs on this side of the resort... I think I saw 1 mosquito over the two weeks we were there. Our evening butler was fantastic, ran us a bubble bath on two different nights, the first one he ran he sprinkled rose petals and lit candles all around the tub - so romantic! Our complimentary tequila and limes were refreshed every day, and we definitely appreciated the nespresso. The housekeeping are great and always do little touches like leave sunglass cleaning wipes next to your shades if they see them out. I would say that if I was at the resort with a baby or toddler I'd recommend the beach front suite instead of the one we were in as they seem safer and don't have the roof deck safety issues to worry about. Service - Excellent. The staff are incredibly friendly and will say hello whenever you pass any of them. People would call us by our names and really made our stay amazing. They all seemed to take pride in the resort and enjoy working there. Breakfast room service seemed to be better than the evening room service dishes we ordered. Spa - We really enjoyed the spa. I enjoyed two different massages by two different people and both were amazing. The spa facilities are beautiful and really relaxing. When I didn't have a spa appointment I would go to use the gym and then enjoy the hot tub, plunge pool, salt scrub/oil, and fab showers afterwards. The gym is small but the machines are brand new and there were rarely other people using it while we were there. The pool at the spa is also excellent for doing laps and is warm. Playa del Carmen - Parrilla is a good spot for Mexican food. We went there one night when we were craving tacos and were not disappointed! Other Notes - The general decor of the resort is really beautiful. Overall it has a modern design but the architects have used limestone, wood, glass, etc. that really work with the natural surroundings. It was so much nicer than some of the faux mayan/mexican hotels we saw along the beach, and is also much nicer than the Mandarin Oriental. Also, if you are travelling here on your honeymoon you may want to avoid going during any public holidays as children are allowed at this resort. The first week we were at Mayakoba there were no children, and the following week was Thanksgiving (hotel was approx 80% occupied) and children were coming out of the woodwork... beach cabanas, loungers, etc. were claimed by families as early as 7:30am each day which was a bit annoying! Also, while staying in this part of Mexico do try to visit the Cenotes... they are beautiful and very unique to this region. Though this isn't a place for the cost conscious, one thing that we were pleased we did was buy a bottle of gin and two six packs of tonic water to keep in our mini fridge. I think we saved a couple hundred bucks doing this and didn't have to go out of way doing so.", "Date": "December 2, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cairo", "Title": "\u201cHeavenly\u201d", "Author": "dkh1105", "ReviewID": "UR22290727", "Content": "We stayed at the Rosewood Mayakoba for 3 nights in late October for our honeymoon before going to Cancun.

Our room was a two room suite, all suite hotel, with two bathrooms, a huge round tub, indoor and outdoor showers, wifi, and our own plunge pool out back. With our room we also received breakfast at the restaurant by the lobby each day. The breakfast was great, room service food was bad. The best food I had while I was there was at the beach restaurant, and also off the menu from the beach. The gym was nice, but the spa was lacking. I was really not impressed with the spa at all. Having stayed at the Fairmont Mayakoba, I was totally spoiled by the Willow Stream Spa. The spa at the Rosewood was dark, not inviting, I had a massage there that I wished would end the minute it started. They were totally chincy on the food in the spa, no muffins, cookies and all the fun things you usually see in a spa -- they had apples and a few juices that were good. The only really good thing in the spa were the showers. Another bad thing about the resort was that there were mass amounts of mosquitos as soon as the sun set. BAD dive biting mosquitos.

I had thoroughly researched the property (and compared to others in the area) before booking as I did not want to be disappointed. Thank you to all the tripadvisor comments as they helped me make the final decision! The Suite: The hotel was of a very high standard. Rooms (all suites) are not a disappointment and were exceptional. We stayed in lagoon suite 410 which I would recommend as it is on a small cul-de-sac away from the buggy-cart pathways and very private indeed. There was a main large room which housed the dining table (three seater), a lounge area with easy chair and sofa, a bar type area with fridge, snack bar and Nespresso Coffee Maker and then the King Bed. Leading off the bed area was a dressing room where the closets were and also a vanity unit, large mirror and seat then on to the bathroom. Bathroom was second to none, huge sunken bath, a very large rain shower leading to the garden where there was another rain shower outdoors. The back 'garden'/patio area is a deck that leads on to the lagoon. There is alarge plunge pool and nice lounge chairs out here. On top of all that is the roof sun deck with a nice round lounge comfy bed to sit on. Room was very light on account of all the windows and had nice lamps (dimmer switches etc) and air conditioning plus a ceiling fan so you can really make it to your personal wishes!!! Everything was of the best quality, not worn at all and extremley clean and modern. Cleanliness is my main concern at hotels and I would say that this place was kept as clean as my own home. The maid service/butler service comes in it appears several times a day since every time we returned to our room they had tidied up, replenished the ice bucket, etc. I got very used to having my stuff tidied up after me (Mums should love this!!!, makes a nice change!!!). What did we love about the suite? >Modern and Clean decor >Large - very spacious >Free WiFi >Amazing Bathtub and Shower >Nespresso Machine >Outdoors-Indoors design - it all felt very natural with lots of light and te bathroom especially made you feel like you were half outside What didn't we love about the suite? >Nothing, if I had to say something I would say we didn't really use the roof deck as we were always at the beach or pool to sunbathe or used the deck facing the lagoon The Amenities: Since we went in off season the place was only 35% full and therefore we had the run of the place. It probably wouldn't feel too crowded though even with more people. Buggy carts take you everywhere in the resort but its easily walkable. You can also get a boat to the beach from the main reception area. Main reception and Cafe Lago restaraunt is the focal point of the resort as breakfast is served here and there are two bars aswell. There is a large pool here and we never saw anyone in it, except ourselves on the odd occasion! And its a beautiful pool! Beach area has a very nice infinity pool, cabanas, a restaraunt (less formal than the other one) and good changing and toilet facilities. There are boats and canoes to use if you want. There is also the kids club here but no children (only a couple of very small babies) during out stay. We went to the beach pool area every day. Have to say the beach/pool service was the best I have exprienced - they make the loungers up for you with an under-'sheet' and then two rolled up towels for comfort, will take up/move around umbreallas, bring you ice buckets and glasses, come around several times to make sure you are ok/need a drink or food order etc, brought around complimentary refreshing fruit coctails every day, facial cooling mists(!) and cold flannels for the face, cucumber slices for your eyes...yes really!!! they could not do enough for you and it was a very pleasant way to sunbathe and enjoy the scenery. You can see the beach from the pool area and its a couple of steps away. If you are a seroius beach person this is perhaps not the place for you since out of the whole experience the beach is probably the least impressive part. Its perfectly adequate and does the job but it is not a patch on other beaches I have been too and is fairly small (thin) to boot. It seemed clean enough and the water was fine but just not the caribbean style I am used to - the beaches are much better and more beautiful in Barbados, Turks and Caicos etc. Its just a standard looking beach so don't come looking for a postcard picture! However, beach does seem 'private' and you don't get bothered by any beach peddlars which can be prevalant in other places in the world! Golf Course is PGA standard and my husband played there twice - he said it was an amazing course, very beautiful and was very quiet when he went. He took the 'sunset' spots (3pm) which were almost half the price of the AM slots if you are looking for a bargain. If you can handle playing in the heat this is a good option. He hired clubs and that cost $60 on top of the course fee. I used the Spa once and had a massage. Spa area is very nice, extremely high quality and very relaxing. Lots of nice water features in the female cnagin areas such as sauna, steam room, cold plunge pool and jacuzzi. Massage was good and I would recommend although the price is very high (incl/ service and tax my 60 mins massage was over $185 - even in Manhattan that is considered very expensive!) so unless you are splashing out I wouldn't bother - you can do it at home for a lot cheaper and it wasn't THAT amazing!). Food: We ate at all the restaraunts in the resort. I notice a lot of people have complained about the food being 'bland' in their comments but we didn't think so. We dine out a lot and like lots of different types of cuisine - all the food we had was good. Breakfast was a lovely buffet - fruits, yoghurt, cheeses, ham, breads, pastries,cereal etc then you order a hot dish like waffles, eggs normal stuff. All very good quality and nicely done. You can eat pretty much as much as you can fit in and we had a very substantial brekkie every day! Coffee was also very nice. Lunch we had down by the pool every day and they do a standard selection of stuff - chicken sanwiches, ceaser salads, a few mexican dishes, burger etc - all perfectly fine. The Chichen sandwich was very good and I had that a few times - very healthy grilled chicken with chipotle mayo and avocado and tomatoes. Good tomato and mozzarella salad also. Dinner we alternated between the beach restaraunt (mexican food and grill) and the main one. Food at both was good. In fact, on our first night we had dinner at the main restaurant and both commented on how good it was: an amuse bouche of foie gras which was excellent, then a warm potato vichysoisse soup which was the best I have tasted and after we both had fish - red snapper and salmon. All was excellent. Not at all bland! The mexican food was more rustic and all fine, flavorful and more 'tapas style' small plates of stew etc. All good although not necessarily what you want to eat every night. We ate also at the Tequila bar and had ceviche - very good. One night we went to Playa del Carmen and ate at Yaxche - nice food and just slightly off the main drag. Was good for a change. Taxi there and back was about $40. Meal there was about $100 (incl. two beers). We also ate at the Fairmont one night and it was ok. The hotel was pretty much dead and we were the only people in the dining room. Was very 'high service' and fancy with silver all over the table but food was good - similar standard really to the Rosewood main restaraunt and about the same prices if not a tad more expensive. The Rosewood car took us there and then the fairmont car brought us back free of charge. All in all the food was of good quality and very nice. However, after 8 nights I was a bit tired by the lack of choices so we shold have probably gone into playa del carmen a couple more times as eating at the hotel so frequently means you go through the menu rather quickly. Also - the food was quite expensive which realy adds to your total bill, just be ready for this! We spent just over $1000 for lunch and dinner for our stay. And we didn't drink a lot of alchol, I had none the entire stay (pregnant) and my husband had one or two beers with dinner only. To give context - a litre bottle of water is about $12. Sandwich at lunch is about $18. Main entree at dinner is between $26 and $40 with appetizers about $18-$22. Service: Was excellent. Seen other peoples reviews that it wasn't great, due to language barrier. My personal opinion is that if you want people who speak perfect English don't go abroad.... :) and my service rating is based on the fact that the people will go the extra mile, do anything to help, are very attentive, remembered our names and preferences (e.g. in the room, our butler noted that we required 2 bottles of water the first day and made sure after that that we always had 2). Very friendly also. Yes, english is not the first language but we didn't find that a problem and it added to the charm. If a server didn't understand they would bring someone else along to help and that happened like twice our whole stay. Service in terms of the personal butler and room service was excellent - we couldn't have asked for better treatment. Had complimentary cappucino brough to our room every morning. The people seemed to work for their 15% service charge that is added to everything. Overall: Loved: the room, the service, the pool area Disliked: the cost of food, the 10% tax and 15% service that are added to everything as it feels a bit heavy when you realize you need to add 25% to absolutely everything incl. the room, the food, the amenities you use etc. It makes an expensive holiday feel even more expensive so account for this 25% when you are planning so that you won't be shocked. And if you are going to resent having to pay it then maybe select somewhere else. We didn't resent it as we felt the service and hotel were excellent (and so they need to be at the price!). Also - try and keep breakfast included as this could heap the overall cost of your stay up even more. We got a special deal which included brekkie and I'm glad of that.", "Date": "September 29, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cLuxurious, Modern, Extraordinary\u201d", "Author": "klm11", "ReviewID": "UR20448570", "Content": "I have just returned from six days at the Rosewood Mayakoba (my husband and I were there to celebrate our fifth anniversary), and I cannot find the words to adequately describe this incredible place. It was paradise; I cannot recommend it highly enough. Please go if you have the chance--you won't regret, and, like us, you will probably find yourself planning your next visit before you even leave the first time. Before I go into detail, just let me say that I travel a lot and am very picky about hotels, and this is hands-down the nicest resort I have ever visited with the best service. Though we have lots of places we want to see all over the world, we have already agreed to come back here every year--it is that good. (Plus, from Chicago it's a 3.5 hour flight and then a 40-minute ride to the resort, so it's even worth it for long weekends.) Now the details, by category: 1. The suite interior. We stayed in a beachfront suite (they have several types of accommodation, but only the beachfront suites, as I understand, open up directly to the beach), and we would not consider staying in any other type. First, the interior is modern, beautiful, and ridiculously spacious (this would apply to all the suites, not just the beachfront ones). There is a dining area, a huge sleeping area with a massive bed, as well as a couch, chair, and flatscreen tv. The bathroom is an event in itself, with two separate vanity areas, a large closet, and indoor/outdoor shower, and a bathtub larger than most wading pools. While it is a big space, it is nonetheless very warm and inviting as the designer used lots of warm tones and rich woods. It is gorgeous, and no detail was overlooked. We also enjoyed the in-suite Nespresso machine and tea press. On the technology side, there is free wifi, tons of movies on demand, and a Bose sound system. 2. The suite exterior. THIS is the reason we would not consider staying in anything but the beachfront suites, as they open up to a huge private deck with an eating area, two lounge chairs and an umbrella, your very own plunge pool, and, last but not least, the ocean. Although the resort has three separate--and amazing--pool areas, we hardly left our deck. We just didn't feel the need to with our own pool right there (it's about 6 feet wide, 12 feet long, and 4.5 feet deep, I would guess). Even though the temperature was nearly 100 degrees everyday we were there, with a heat index of about 110, we were very comfortable--we would read in our lounge chairs beneath the umbrella, enjoying the strong breeze from the ocean, and when we became too hot, we could jump into our pool mere inches away or walk to the ocean, maybe 50 feet away. It was the best of both worlds. Plus, we were still at our own suite with easy access to the bathroom, the mini-bar, room service, or anything else we might need. At night, we enjoyed falling asleep to the sound of waves. 3. The service. From the driver who picked us up at the airport, to Eduardo who welcomed us upon our arrival and gave us a tour by boat on our way to our suite, to JC , our very own \"butler\" for the week, to every single person we encountered (housekeeping, room service, restaurant staff), we were endlessly impressed by the level of service we received. Everyone was kind, incredibly helpful, and spoke amazing English (I speak a little Spanish but didn't really need it). 4. The restaurants. We enjoyed a lot of in-room dining during our stay (again, with that great deck, we couldn't pass up breakfast and sometimes dinner on the ocean), but we did visit the main restaurant, the beach restaurant, and the spa cafe and loved the food at each place. We are vegetarian and had a little trouble at the main restaurant as pretty much every main dish contained animal products--which is totally fine. We try to be flexible on vacation and don't expect special treatment; we can always find something. We usually don't even mention our dietary restrictions, not wanting to cause anyone extra trouble, but we had mentioned it to JC our first day when we were discussing food choices. Well, he must have made note of it thereafter because everyone knew. For example, I ordered something at the beach restaurant that contained meat (the description didn't note that), and the waiter came back to tell me about the meat and to suggest an alternative. At the main restaurant, we were just going to order sides and salads, but before we got the chance, our waiter said that he noted that we are vegetarians and that the chef would like to come to our table to discuss options with us (he had great suggestions and--without us even asking--offered to make anything off-menu that we might like). There is also a game room and a tequila bar, though we didn't make it to either...this time. 5. The fitness facility and spa. I used the gym several times, and it was great--all new equipment (3 treadmills, 3 bikes, 5 or 6 ellipticals , lots of weights), fresh towels, snacks, and water, etc. My husband got a massage and thus was able to see the interior of the spa; he said that it was incredible, the massage was one of the best he has received, and the spa's facilities were impressive--a steam room, plunge pools, a sauna, and so forth. After our workouts and/or spa visits, we hung around to swim in the spa pool and enjoy lunch at spa cafe. I highly recommend it. 6. General comments/conclusion. Though we did not participate in any this time, there are several recreational activities offered through or near the resort as well; these include kayaking, snorkeling, wave-running, sightseeing (visiting towns and nearby Mayan ruins), etc. The resort also has its own golf course. This is a phenomenal place--definitely check it out if you have the chance.", "Date": "September 28, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "NY", "Title": "\u201cDon't stay here unless you have an ocean room\u201d", "Author": "lwindrow", "ReviewID": "UR20152038", "Content": "We stayed at the resort for 8 days and the hotel was empty. 8% occupancy. We were in a Lagoon room, which is BEAUTIFUL and very spacious. However, being on the lagoon we were BIT UP SO BAD. Our 20 month old daughter had bites all over her face and arms (and we sprayed her non-stop with bug spray). One night we had to leave our dinner because the bugs were so bad. AND they only had one dinner choice -- outside. The staff was being bit just as bad. The food was just average -- our daughter had virutally nothing to eat the whole time. She ate the ham and turkey at the buffet for breakfast and lunch because nothing else tasted good. We had to go to the store to get yogurt because they said they didn't have any. However, when we came back from the store, they kept it until the morning and then brought us the wrong kind -- activia -- and it is not what we bought and made our daughter go to the bathroom non-stop all day. Many means were cold or not cooked properly. I would NOT recommend the food at all. People who were staying in the beach front rooms had NO problems at all. They are paying more so they are getting different service. We had so many problems that we think they were happy when it was time to go. The staff tried really hard but each person gave us a different answer. When we arrived they said they didn't have cribs -- only pack and plays. My daughter immediately climbed out of the pack and play and would not sleep there. They ultimately found a crib but we were told by other people that they had a crib in their room when they arrived. Because it is kid friendly and only 2 kids at the whole resort, something was wrong with the story. I also fell down by the dock in a very unsafe area (the boat driver told me that people fall there daily) and I really hurt myself and they never even asked again if I was ok and wanted me to pay for the aspirin from the giftshop so that I could deal with the pain. the resort is really lovely and the staff are very nice but we had serious inconsistencies.

WOW! WOW! What an amazing property. My boyfriend and I just returned from a 5 day stay at the Rosewood, where we were treated with impecable service. I have stayed at the finest hotels in the world and I must say this has been my favorite and most satisfying experience. Because I have traveled so much, I have become extremely critical when judging hotels. This hotel sets the bar for any 5 star property. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone. The suites are beautifully decorated and all have plunge pools. In addition, a butler is at your service, whether it being to make you reservations, pack or unpack your suitcase,draw you a candle lit bath or bring you a free tequila bottle and Fiji water every day. Each and every staff member is eager to help and will do anything possible for you during your stay. They all remember your name and suite number and make you feel very special. The food was excellent and the restaurant service was great. The beach is the most beautiful beach...kiyaks and sail boats were free and the snorkeling tour we went on was the most gorgeous underwater experience. There are golfcarts and Duffy boats to transport you around the property. I suggest the boat, of course, where you go thru the lagoons and can see a crocodile or two if you are lucky. The resort has 128 suites but we hardly saw anyone, we felt like we had our own private vacation. The spa is excellent, the therapists are great and they serve a special juice and a fruit salad after your treatment. If you are willing to spend the money, indulge in the private romantic dinner for two, where you have a candlelit table with firepits and tiki torches around you, right on the beach. We felt like we were on one of those reality tv shows that go on the romantic getaways. It was the most incredible experience. I definitely would choose this resort over any other in Cancun/Riviera Maya/Playa del Carmen. If you can splurge, go for the beachfront suite...it's paradise!

We were celebrating our 10th anniversary and wanted to return to the Playa del Carmen area where we had had a good experience on a previous vacation, staying at the Royal Hideaway. We are in our late 30's and vacation 1-2 times a year, but I wouldn't say we are big travelers. Traveling without our children and for an anniversary, we were looking for something very special. Bottom line: we absolutely loved this resort. Here are the high notes. The entrance to the resort from the roadway is far nicer than the many you pass coming from Cancun. Its modern and distinctive, and set a great tone for our stay. The resort buildings and grounds are beautiful. The architecture and design are clean, modern and stylish. The designers used lots of mohogany, fine stone and glass and it really works. There is a beautiful pool at the main buildings, and a second down by the beach, which is a 5 minute golf cart ride from the main area of the resort. Note: If you stay down by the beach, you are dependant on the circulating golf carts to take you to the main restaurant, bars and spa. We stayed in #209, a suite on one of the lagoons and we were a very short walk to everything but the beach (which we rode a cart to) and we were glad we did. Here's were it really gets good... The suite blew us away. Lots of space, beautifully designed with tons of sunlight, yet pretty private. This was an over-the-lagoon suite with a plunge pool and garden shower, which is a walk-out from the massive bathroom. Lots of glass and sunlight in the bathroom and garden, but completely private. Other things we loved...6 massive mahogany sliding pocket doors which shut out all the light from our bedroom, spacious living room with flat screen TV, double teak lounger on the deck, AND an input jack for my iPod on the room's Bose sterio. The gym and spa were just off-the-charts great. Its unbelievable that we had the use of a great gym and massive locker and treatment areas, including sauna, steam, rain shower, cold plunge pool and relaxation room, all at no extra charge. My wife and I spent 1-2 hours every morning before breakfast just because we could. Loved this. The beach side pool was good. No struggle for a lounger, but this was off season so the place was only 40% full. I was disappointed at the infrequency with which the wait staff checked in with us by the pool. There was an offset though, timely refreshing of my melting ice bucket and complimentary cold face clothes passed out in the afternoon. The beach was beautiful. Not every resort around Playa has a great beach. Rosewood does. Lets face it, you care who's in the lounger next to you. The clientele was perfectly reasonable and upscale as you would expect. There were some families with small children but the children were very well behaved in every case. The staff was great and very courteous. I expected nothing less. Other areas of service were very nice. Make sure you utilize the laundry service because your clothes magically appear the same day, perfectly done and packaged up in cute little logo bands, and thoughtfully put away in your closet! Loved this! We love food...I wouldn't say this food was world-class, but it was delicious. This is Playa, after all, not New York. Good wine list too. As important, it seemed very reasonably priced. And I've got to mention the Tequila Bar. Hundreds of obscure and not so obscure tequilas, occasional live music, and delicious appetizers to nibble on, open each evening at 5pm. I thought this was a great idea and really enjoyed it. That's it. We've raved about this place to anyone who will listen and we'll definitely be back.

The 900$/night plus 27% was a good deal for this beachside room. Property is fully booked during November and December. Great vibe and great service. Free valet parking. Free internet. The boat to your room is a relaxing touch and we saw three baby crocodiles in the lagoon. The personnel and butlers were fresh faced and less jaded than the employees at Las Ventanas. The fact that it has only been opened 6 months is a plus for everything but the food.... Food: we ate at all the beach restaurants and would rank them in terms of flavor 1. Fairmont, 2. Mandarin Oriental, 3. Rosewood. In terms of atmosphere: 1. Mandarin 2. Rosewood 3. Fairmont is a bit dowdy and outright ugly in comparison. You can walk along the beach to the Mandarin Oriental, Fairmont -- and that was one of the nice things about staying on the beach -- the proximity to the other establishments. And the ability to walk along the beach and dine, then walk home. Make sure to have your butler draw your bath. It's really three different resorts: The Lagoon side, the beachside and the Spa island. Most families stayed in the larger lagoon side suites. There was a young twenty something couple in 614 that were nude most of their stay and seemed to enjoy each other. There is other topless activity on the beach so if you have a problem with it or are prudish, better to know ahead of time. There are only 16 rooms on the sand, all small and really designed for a couple. Room 600 is right next to Beach pool and might be loud but could be good if you bring kids and want to be close to the kids club and kiddie pool. 604 to 615 are all far enough from the pool and very private. 616 connects to the presidential suite, 617 is the main body of the presidential suite, 2 bedrooms, media room, large butler's pantry, plunge pools off both bedrooms. Both Korn and Seal have stayed in the Presidential Suite. The master bedroom of the Presidential Villa (618) has a large pool and abuts the Viceroy (currently there was no construction activity). If the viceroy starts construction again, could be some noise. But our dates (aug 21-24) it was at a standstill. Once the viceroy is completed, there will also be more beach traffic.

Two married under 40\u2019s, well traveled, stay at Hiltons, Marrriotts weekly for work, and stay at Ritz, Four Season, Rosewood, etc for personal vacation. Have stayed at several Rosewood properties in the past including Las Ventanas. Our stay was 5 days/4 nights. I will break down the review into sections to make it easier. Airport Transfer: Came out of the mess at Cancun airport know as \u2018timeshare central\u2019 after customs. Was nice to have driver waiting on us (well worth the $140). Mercedes was pulled around and off we went. The driver had zero personality and not too friendly--not a good start, but I understand. Arrival Had staff waiting on us, and loaded into boat ready to take us to our room. Very nice person to give us tour an the way over, and the room over looking lagoon was peaceful and great view. please note that the majority of lagoon view rooms you will not have much privacy due to the fact your neighbors or those across will be able to view right into your room. Kids, kids, kids Okay, so when we go on vacation, we are looking for peace and quite--no kids running around uncontrolled. We also appreciate a pool that is adults only--something you will not find at Mayakopa. There are kids all over this resort and if you want to get away from them you better head to your room. I don\u2019t have anything against kids (and half the time it\u2019s the parents fault for not disciplining them), but note to parents--please keep in mind there are others at the resort that may not want to hear your kids. There are two pools (and actually another one by the spa) both of which are kid central. Again if you want a resort for the kiddies you will be at home--if you are looking for a place to relax and get away from that noise go elsewhere. Pool Much smaller area than expected. The main pool by the beach is nice, but quite small (as compared to other Rosewood resorts). To get to this pool you will need to walk for 15 minutes or grab a golf cart. Once again as noted above, if pool is full of kiddies running out of control (forget about getting a cabana, as the one next to it will have kiddies screaming all day most likely). Pool Service One word--terrible--period. If you have stayed at other Rosewood resorts you will know that by the pool or beach they will continue to bring water all day at no charge. The service here you can tell they really do not like their jobs. In 5 days there was not one time that the pool guys came by proactively to offer water. The first day once I finally found one, he brought Fiji water, which two bottles cost $30 USD--pretty lame if you consider they have free water if you ask. The service was consistently bad, and they were quite frankly rude when you did ask them for something (what is wrong with that picture). If you are use to the great Rosewood pool service, you will be disappointed here. Food The food is quite good at the pool restaurant and the \u2018fancy\u2019 restaurant by check-in. We ate at both for lunch and dinner (and even breakfast) everyday. The staff is nice, but not over friendly or knowledgeable on the food choices. Be prepared to spend about $400 on food/drink for two people (keep in mind everything you buy or use gets a 12% resort fee and a 10% tax--so that $8 coke will cost you $9.75) on a daily basis. Prices are high but one should expect that on vacation--just wish the service was better. Butler Service At other resorts we have really found this service of great benefit. Here we had 5 butlers in 5 days--no consistency. They were pretty cold (even with some nice tips), not too helpful and always still doing things in our room when we returned from dinner every night. They need to put all of these people back in training. During our last day the butler did not bring the bill, had to call 3 times to get bags taken to lobby, they threw things away out of room that were not suppose to be thrown away--basic disorganization at it\u2019s finest. There is a lot more to tell, but our over all impression would be not to return to this resort. Primarily because there are way too many kids, and the service is very lacking--I cannot stress that enough. For basically $1000 per day with food, I would much rather stay elsewhere and get better service. I read many reviews talking about the lack of service, and unfortunately they are all too true. The service is what you expect at any run of the mill hotel, not a Rosewood resort. If you want so/so to lacking service and you want your vacation to consistently interrupted by kids screaming at the pool, dinner, lunch and everywhere else--then this is the place to go. If you are looking for a peaceful vacation with great service I would suggest finding something else. The staff told us on different occasions that they are not happy--and believe me it showed.", "Date": "August 17, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, CA", "Title": "\u201cBest hotel ever\u201d", "Author": "We_like_2_eat", "ReviewID": "UR19029245", "Content": "We went to Rosewood during the first week of June 2008.

I think we were the only couple staying on the SI so it was very private and quiet. Even if there were couples in the suites on either side of you it is built up in between so you wouldn't really be able to see them much unless you were trying to. Actually, the whole resort was pretty laid back and quiet. It seems to be the type of place to go if you want to just have privacy and peace and quiet. In my opinion they should make it an adult only resort. The service was wonderful, our private butler was very attentive and prompt. All staff was willing to help in any way they could. Our pool was too warm when we got there and we called to ask for it to be cooled down..the next day it was much cooler and more relaxing. Most days we ordered lunch in the room, it was always there within 45 minutes and they would come pick up the dishes whenever you wanted. The food was decent but not spectacular. I didn't have anything at RM that made me think \"wow, this is really good\". We did a tequila tasting in Agave Azul, which was excellent. I recommend this if you get the opportunity. FYI: It is cheaper to open a bottle from the mini bar and drink that then to order drinks at the pool. The 200ml of Appleton we drank was $48 as opposed to $15 small margaritas...and everything has a 25% service charge at this resort. So 2 drinks at the pool came to about $40 with service charge and tip. (I didn't feel as if anyone had their hand out for a tip, on the contrary, I felt everyone was very grateful for any tip given... I worked in service for many years in college and would never NOT tip, I consider that very rude and cheap) We set up a 5 hr tour with one of the drivers from the hotel who took us out for an authentic Mexican breakfast, to Tulum and then to a private beach for lunch. What a great trip that was. At Tulum we were set up with a private tour guide who was very informative and interesting. The beach we went to had excellent food and was so beautiful, it was a perfect day. This service was about $400 plus $100 for tip In summary, this was an amazing resort, amazing vacation and someplace I hope to go back to in the near future.

If 2 people are going for a week expect to spend close to $2000 just on meals and know ahead of time the food there overall is pretty good but not spectacular.

The positive is that the property is beautiful. The rooms are really nice and big and all have decent sized plunge pools. Throughout our stay we found the quality of the food to be poor with high prices. We live in New York, so we are used to paying high prices, but we do expect decent quality food. We ended up eating dinners at the neighboring resorts. The Mandarin Oriental's beach side restaurant, and The Fairmont's Las Brisas were similarly priced to the Rosewood restaurants and were MUCH better in terms of both quality of food and service. In addition to the poor food quality and service at the Rosewood restaurants, in the evening it seems that all of the restaurants have a major mosquito problem. However, instead of recommending that people sit inside to avoid the mosquitoes, they pretend that the problem does not exist. So, every night people would start eating outside and then end up moving in. After spending the our last few vacations at Four Seasons resorts, we were expecting the Rosewood to be of similar quality, being that it was similarly priced. Staying here showed me that you do not always get what you pay for. Over the course of our trip we got used to a very mediocre standard of service where in general the staff seemed inconvenienced by even the smallest request and also seemed to always have their hands out for tips. Many of the staff members did not even speak English well enough to communicate simple things like directions to areas of the resort. Waiters at the beachfront pool are impossible to come by. We tried on several occasions to order drinks. Each time, we received the same reply, \u201clet me get your waiter\u201d. This is not the correct answer at a luxury resort. This is the correct answer at a Howard Johnson's. Sometimes we just had to wait a very long time for any kind of service, and other times, the waiters just never came over. I actually timed how long it took for a waiter to get to our chairs one day. The funny thing was that he never got there, even though as soon as I sat down I asked someone to send over our waiter. We stayed at the chairs for 45 minutes and didn't see one waiter. The fitness center is tiny. My wife and I like to go the gym everyday and found that if there were more than 2 or 3 people in the gym that it got very crowded. There were no barbells at all and very few free weights and machines. My wife and I were very excited to visit this resort and really could not have been more disappointed. Our disappointment was due to the poor food quality and service, which were far below what we have come to expect when paying these kind of prices.

Based on early reviews, most of the 'kinks' have been worked out. We loved this place. You'll spend an arm and a leg, but so what. If you're looking to splurge and not have to go too far, here's your place. 3 cons: First, mosquitoes - but hey, you're at the edge of the jungle. They do the best they can keeping them down. Second, alcohol sticker shock. $15-18 for drinks is ridiculous. We went out and bought our own stuff. Only other minor negative is kids at the beach pool. They really do change the mood, but not much you can do about it except get up and go somewhere else. Honestly, it's not really a place I'd take my kids. Everything else was A+. Service was over the top. The suite was perfect. We ate at all 3 restaurants there - food/service/ambience was first class. Breakfast served in the room was a perfect start to each day. We would go back in a heartbeat. The area is being heavily developed, so it may be a different place by next year, but for now it's heaven. I wouldn't be surprised if this resort gets named #1 in the Caribbean by next year in a few of the polls.

We stayed in a Deluxe Overwater Lagoon Suite and loved it. Several other reviewers have commented about the mesquitos. They were definitely there, but I didn't think they were as bad as other people mentioned. The property does fumigate every evening now. Restaurants...There are two restaurants on the property; a beachside casual restaurant and a fancy, upscale restaurant. The beachside restaurant has great food and incorporates flavors of the region. The upscale restaurant is good, but not as good as it should be for what they charge and hype it up to be. There is also a tequila bar with a very wide selection. Spa...Absolutely fantastic. Probably the best spa I have ever been to. Besides the services you pay for, they also have a jacuzzi, a cold plunge pool, a massaging rain shower, mineral salts to exfoliate with....at no additional charge. Strongly recommend visiting it even if you don't pay for any of their services. Service...this is the one area that was spotty. Most of the people were great and provided excellent service. However, there were a few times where service wasn't quite up to par. Overall, it's a great resort and I would recommend it, however, keep in mind that everything on the resort is pricey.", "Date": "July 25, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Malibu, CA", "Title": "\u201cOl\u00e9!

We stayed in a gorgeous Deluxe Ocean View Beach Suite...and I was completely blown away. We had a view of the lagoon from the back of our room, and a view of the sea from the front. Aside from the scenic property and warm swimming pools (which is key for me!), the staff is what made this place for me. On our first night at the resort, we had yummy tapas at the tequila bar. While we were dining, the butler assigned to our suite had prepared a trail of roses & candles leading towards a perfectly warm bubble bath amidst more candles and scented oils. He told my hubby to tell me that it was his own idea, but hubby couldn't keep a straight face. Either way, that was just the beginning to a peaceful, restful and luxurious vacation.

I checked the site again closer to the date we were leaving and found many more positive reviews and that was more reassuring. For those who have been to other Rosewood properties, the bar is set high and that was our greatest fear: how would it compare to Las Ventanas? I would say that the property itself possibly exceeds L.V. and the service is on par or better. The food at Mayakoba was very good but not exceptional. There is one incredible aesthetic surprise after the other once you arrive at the resort (I won't spoil it for you-you have to look forward to them in person!) and the property is nothing short of spectacular. The reception area, the rooms, the restaurants, the spa, the pools, you name it-all gorgeous! Even the public bathrooms are beautiful. Here are the only negatives we experienced: at check-in we requested an upgrade and despite being at only 50% occupancy they did not upgrade us (nor any other guest we spoke to who mentioned the same thing), and the golf carts that take you from one area of the sprawling resort to another are harder to come by than we would have preferred at times. But those are minor things in relation to how great everything else was, and even in their \"entry level\" room you are in a spacious and luxe room with every room getting its own plunge pool and outdoor shower along with a rooftop lounge space. Service: WOW! Between the pool and beach guys who fall at your feet to cater to your every whim along with the incredibly friendly staff in every restaurant, spa, and housekeeping. We left the resort one night to dine at Mandarin Oriental's Ambar (also fantastic but bring your wallet!) and the Rosewood took care of the transportation both ways and were seemingly happy to do so. The best part is that you never feel like the service is all about an expected tip; it seems like these people just love their jobs and are happy to be helpful. We were called by our names (Mr. & Mrs.) by most of the staff after only a few days there and made to feel like celebrated guests. Overall, I cannot say enough good about this resort and yes, it's pricey but for a romantic and opulent getaway, it's worth every penny!", "Date": "July 20, 2008"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Rosewood Mayakoba", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g150812-d754465-Reviews-Rosewood_Mayakoba-Playa_del_Carmen_Yucatan_Peninsula.html", "Price": "$487 - $1,064*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Ctra.
