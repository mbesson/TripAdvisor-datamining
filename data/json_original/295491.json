The hotel is unique for three reasons. First, it is located right next to the Chora (Kariye) museum, the small version of the Aya Sophia, with superb, recently restored 12th century Greek Orthodox mosaics and frescoes. Second, the hotel is home to the Asitane restaurant, a wonderful Ottoman-style restaurant, that has a series of tables in the large, tree-shaded patio of the hotel. Eating at a patio table, you feel like you are at a fine country inn. Third, the Kariye Hotel has been converted from a large wooden Ottoman home, and retains a certain family feeling in the scale of the building and the friendliness and helpfulness of the staff. But there are still more attractions to staying at the Kariye. Efforts have been made to close the area to vehicle traffic, especially in the large tree-shaded square in front of the Chora, that is filled with cafe tables, and is such an appealing place to sit and sip tea, while watching the comings and goings of the neighborhood population and the steady stream of visitors to the museum, that you can happily spend hours there. It seems very far from the rush and noise of central Istanbul at the Kariye, and indeed, it is. To get to the heart of tourist Istanbul, in the Sultanahmet district, takes about twenty minutes by taxi. The hotel desk is very helpful in calling a taxi for you, and explaining to the driver where you want to go. We booked a suite this time. It was a corner unit, with windows that overlooked a row of shops in traditional two and three-story wooden houses across the street, and the ancient domes and walls of the Chora church next to the hotel, and separated from it by trees and the garden surrounding Chora. The furniture of the room was French regency style; painted white and gold, with upholstered seats and backrests. Because it was a corner unit, we had a good breeze through the sitting room and bedroom; very welcome, since there is no air-conditioning. The bathroom needed to be remodeled. It was barely adequate. A somewhat erratic breakfast service is included in the room rate. Having breakfast on the patio is very pleasant, but was only possible one of the three days we were there. There is no elevator. Hotel staff were very accommodating; taking our bags to and from our room. Room rates are reasonably modest. The community around the hotel is an older working class one, of low rise wooden houses and concrete apartment buildings, small shops and cafes. The ancient Byzantine wall that once encircled Constantinople (Istanbul) is a short walk away. It is undergoing considerable restoration. This is a quirky sort of location and the hotel matches it. It is a very appealing place to stay, if you do not mind being twenty minutes by taxi from the Sultanahmet district of Istanbul.", "Date": "July 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bucharest", "Title": "\u201cCozy and very pleasant!\u201d", "Author": "Liriodendron10", "ReviewID": "UR107949824", "Content": "I've just return from Istanbul were I've stay at this hotel. I found the experience very nice and I like it very much even is far from historical center - Sultanahmet. Anyway the location is beside a very famous byzantine church - Chora - in a very quiet place. The rooms are big enough, heated, very clean, very nice decorated in a restored building made from wood. The breakfast is not abundandant but good and healthy ( cheese, tomatoes,yoghurt,boiled eggs, butter, cofee, tea, juice,pine honey). If I would go again in Istanbul I would choose this hotel it again. Is the best price vs quality parity you can find and within 15 minutes by bus you are in the center. Is only 1.7 TL bus ticket.
