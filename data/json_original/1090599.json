{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Excellent little hotel in a near perfect location. This place is really a hidden gem with a near perfect location....to me at least. It's located on a small little side street just minutes from the main action of Shinjuku. Not only that the hotel is DIRECTLY across the street from the Golden Gai bar area and the incredibly well kept garden path that leads DIRECTLY into the heart of Shinjuku. If you don't know what the Golden Gai is look it up. In addition the hotel is also directly beside a tasty Ramen place and straight across from a Coffee shop which was great for breakfast.  The hotel itself is simple and small but very well kept with an incredibly nice staff. The rooms aren't fancy, in fact they're very plain and cheap looking but they have everything you need and were always clean. Each room has it's own internet connection and the bathrooms are equipped with TOTO washlet units. In addition to the room internet connection the main lobby has a free internet computer for those lacking their own computer.  I didn't book in advance so I was moved around every night but the single room rate was only $76 per night. Double bed rooms were about $110. And as a side note I've also stayed at the $350 per night Cerulean Tower Hotel and I'm being completely honest when I say I'll take the Shinjuku Urban hotel every time. There is no reason whatsoever to spend vasts amounts of money on superficial hotel rooms when places like the Shinjuku Urban hotel exist.", "Date": "Aug 3, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR711687079", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "activeaero"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1066457-d1090599-r18560747-Shinjuku_Urban_Hotel-Shinjuku_Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html", "HotelID": "1090599", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
