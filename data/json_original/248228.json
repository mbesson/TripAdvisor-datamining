The second room had 3 spots of mold on the bathroom ceiling and had so many things wrong with it, we have taken pictures and will post them online. I booked 3 rooms and paid $54 per room, other guests in the hall said they paid--for the same rooms $40, $45 and $80. broken window frames, cockroaches dead in hall way, huge bug splattered on wall, cracks in walls, mold completely around tub, bottom of tub black, rust all over light fixture in bathroom, only one wash cloth and when asked for second one--they said--we don't have any more. In the AM, we ventured down the street and found a Comfort Inn and Suites that will be the place we stay from now on. oh, forgot--from outside, the lobby and the outside of the pool area, looks like an ok place, i guess if you get some of their \"newer\" rooms--at $129 each they might be better but garbage at bottom of pool.

Little did we know how right he would be. After a quick check-in, we cruised down the main hallway up the stairs to the left, as the front desk instructed, to get to our room. With no signs to direct us, we asked a maintenance man for directions in Spanish. He told us to exit the building, walk through a parking lot, enter another building, and go up a flight of stairs to find our room. Ok... Once in the room, there are no options for bedding, e.g. two doubles, a queen, king. You get a double. Three people, a double and a single. We pulled off the polyester bed cover, checked the linens for stains, and pulled up the mattress for signs of bedbugs. We soon learned that there is no such thing as housekeeping for fresh sheets, pillows, blankets, towels. The television was circa 1991 and more static than clarity. The shower was a trickle of water at best, with the occasional drop of heat. Paint peels off the walls inside and outside the rooms. At least our flip flops didn't stick to any of the flooring. Also, the hotel shuttle does not run 24 hours a day as advertised! Walking down our hallway, the card key lock had been removed from one room's door and through the holes we could see that it was occupied. Read drug den. The halls smelled of all kinds of smoke. Not wanting to spend any more time than necessary in our room, we asked the front desk about restaurant options. She mentioned the bar/restaurant in the hotel. Right. The back side of the restaurant, the kitchen and dish-washing area, opens into the main hotel hallway and is enough negative advertising for the place. The inside doesn't offer much to better the impression. Other than that, the front desk mentioned the three fast food chains within walking distance. No, thank you. BEWARE OF AIRWAYS INN AND SUITES!

They took down the reservation and gave me a confirmation number and we hopped on our cruise without a worry in the world. When our cab dropped us off at the hotel at the end of the cruise, the man at the front desk told us that someone had canceled the reservation at 4 the same day we booked it, which was impossible because we were on the cruise at that point. He was not able to give us the room at the price we had first gotten the room at, which was $75 so then it became $86 and with taxes the final cost was $100. Then to store your bags while you lay at the pool is $2 per bag, a fee he so kindly waved because of their mistake with the room, but they never actually admitted it. When we were finally able to check in, the first room they gave us the keys would not work and the maid let us in.

We decided to ask for a second room at this point. The second room was a little better, the carpet wasn't quite as dirty and it felt safer because it was on the second floor but the drain in the shower was rusted out and the shower floor was stained and the tile was discolored. I never took my shoes off in the room, even to shower. The bed wasn't too bad, comfort wise but the sheets felt damp. The shuttle would only take you to the airport on the hour and the driver didn't help load the bags into the van at the hotel but then insisted on taking them out of the van for you, thinking you should tip him at that point.

Only consider it if you have a pair of slippers to shower in, and something to lie on, and you are quite desperate, so desperate, very desperate, extemely desperate, you know, cant do ANY better type of desperate.

We had missed our connection in Miami enroute to Jamaica due to a late departure from New York and had to spend the night in Miami. Because of late flights coming into Miami from all over the U.S many people became stranded and needed accomodations. After calling just about every airport hotel on the hotel board in the airport this place was the only one available so we had no choice. When we arrived at the hotel I was totally sickened but what choice did I have. Trying to find our room was a obstacle in its self. The real horror began when I entered the room. It was disgustingly filthy, hair in the beds, dustballs and little creatures crawling everywhere. The bathroom looked like a scene out of the movie Texas Chainsaw Massacre. To me it looked like dried blood running down the walls and the medicine cabinets, well I won't even try to figure out what was growing in there. After travelling all day and with no other choice I decided to go to bed sleeping with my clothes on, on top of the bed with a large beach towel between me and the bedspread. Thank God when my alarm went off the next morning. Not that I got any sleep because I stayed awake all night making sure nothing crawled over me and listening to the planes take off right out side my door. When they say its an airport hotel they aren't lying. Its literally on the runway. When the planes took off you pretty much had to hold on to something to avoid being shaken out of your bed. No Joke!! 6am the next morning I was out of there. Straight to the airport for my 10am flight. The worst part of this ordeal was the fact that I got charged $170.00 for a night at the bates motel. They sure know how to get people when they know their stranded. I'm not a picky person. All I ask is for a clean place to lay my head and I certainly didn't get it here. All in all, it was a terrible experience that I can laugh at now even though it was only two weeks ago and the fact that I a wonderful time in paradise, but please, if you ever fall into a situation where you need to find a place in Miami close by the airport DO NOT STAY HERE!!", "Date": "February 24, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ottawa", "Title": "\u201cOkay for a tight budget\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4344905", "Content": "The Airways Airport Inn and Suites in Miami was an okay hotel (some might consider this too description generous).

It reminded me of one of those dirty motels that are always on COPS. The place smelled like urine, the rooms were dirty, and it was all-around crappy. The people were rude at the desk, and could hardly speak english. At the end of a long, smelly hallway was our equally smelly and dirty room. The bed sheets were itchy and dirty-looking, and there were only 2 towels for a suite. There was a divider in between the beds, and there was only one TV for both sides. The wires on it were exposed, with no wall plate covering it (not to code). Late at night, someone was jiggling our door handle, so we placed our baggage in front ouf the door. We had to wake up early for a flight(5 AM), and the free shuttle to the airport was a joke. When the van showed up, the driver was drunk. He stumbled from the van, opened the back door, and went into the hotel lobby bathroom. We had to load our own bags, and it took him at least ten minutes to return. We arrived, luckily, on time, and unloaded our own bags on the airport curb. Although the brand name hotels charge more, stay at them. Pay for the safe shuttle and a good night's rest.

If it wasn't because my husband and I were dead tired from a long trip and it was Calle Ocho weekend so there was not a room available anywhere, I would have never stayed here. But, we had no choice - it was either sleep in the room or the car. To begin, hallways were filthy dirty, hotel looked very old and rundown. Very bad odor. Our room was worst. We were afraid to touch anything! The sheets were never changed and had a bad smell, so we slept with our clothes on (not even pjamas) and no did not use the sheets to cover us. The TV base was laying on the floor broken when we walked in. Since we were near the airport, there was a lot of noice from planes and the cars. When we paid via credit card for the room at the front office, the clerk wanted me to sign a blank receipt with no quantity on it - leaving us with an impression that these people were not too honest. We had to pay $2 for parking - it should have been free! We complained about the condition of our room and were only given a $10 discount.
