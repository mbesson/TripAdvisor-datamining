The room was perfect, large double with double glazed doors to keep out the street noise. This is not a modern styled hotel and the furnishings/decoration are classic (chandleries & teak furniture) - which adds to an atmosphere of old fashioned grandeur! & spotlessly clean! 3. The pool: must be the biggest hotel sundeck in Madrid \u2013 the pool is clean and large, the whole rooftop area is again well managed \u2013 the staff all very welcoming and helpful and the restaurant service fast.

It was actually really hot weather-so the rooftop pool was ideal! So glad we booked a hotel with a pool- which is a must with a young child. The rooms had a little balcony- which I enjoyed-could sit out at night and watch the world go by! The Madrilenos are pretty much Night Owls! we found that they would come out of the cinema about 10.30-11pm and sit with their family and have a meal- which we loved- as they obviously feel safe. We encountered friendly people in this city. The hotel was spotlessly clean- the rooms cleaned well each day, there is a hairdryer and toiletries and fresh towels each day. Could not fault the cleanliness.The lift is really small-and always have to wait ages so use the stairs if you can!The buffet breakfast is great- lots of choice but we think you have to pay extra for cooked omelettes or bacon. Something to do with a voucher- not sure as we never wanted cooked food- there is fruit,yoghurts, meats, cheeses, toast, muffins and cereals - we found a deal with breakfast included in the price- otherwise at 19 euros- quite expensive I think! Also not sure what was going on with the cava - we had some bucks fizz type drink one morning then it was never opened after that! Not sure whether they also charged extra for this! At the pool there is hot food and the food was lovely- really recommend. Except for the fact we found a small orange \"top\" in the salad- not sure what it was off- but we did complain and the staff apologised. However when reported to management no response! That is not good- luckily no one choked on it! But apart from that excellent food if a bit pricey! The drinks at the pool are also expensive- and although no-one is supposed to take food or drinks up there- we found loads of people were taking bottles of water- just be discreet. We think there should have been free water and also waiter service around the pool- but they seem understaffed at times- so maybe that its the reason- but it would have been so much better !! There are showers and a dressing room as well- and also supply towels. A definite plus to choosing the hotel! The Hotel is very central for everywhere as well- and lots of restaurants nearby. Also noticed some of the reviews were moaning about the noise- we found it fine- and we were on the first floor- it is a little noisy if you leave doors of balcony open but there is air con which is great and so you can shut out the noise.

In April, after a lovely wedding in a lovely hotel, we were looking forward to our honeymoon in Madrid! What a let down! We thought the taxi had brought us to the wrong hotel as the building was so shrouded in scaffolding we could not recognise it as the one advertised! When we got to our room, it was very disappointing. It was very small and very musty. We went down to complain to a very disinterested manager who told us that there were no other rooms for us to move to. His attitude was \"take it or leave it\"! As there were workmen outside our windows creating dust and noise, we could not leave them open for ventilation, and with the air-conditioner blowing out hot, not cool air, sleeping was made very uncomfortable. When we got home we complained to the tour company as there were no reps on site. The tour company did not want to know! For every complaint we made, they had an excuse. We demanded a refund as we felt our honeymoon was ruined and the hotel was not fit for purpose!

It is like an oasis after a day of sightseeing in hot, dry Madrid. Two negatives about the pool area for young children: there is no shallow end, it's all deep water. Also, the pool water is very cold! If you are only with adults or older children, it wouldn't be an issue. It really is very pleasant up there. The staff at the front desk were friendly and helpful. My son really liked Alfonso, he was always very friendly to us. I speak Spanish, so I had an easier time communicating than someone who doesn't . The breakfast buffet was good with plenty of options. We had this included with our room. You needed a ticket, though, to go to the omelette station. The first day, the guy at the entrance gave me a ticket without me even asking. The next day, he didn't hand me one. I asked for it, and he said he had to check to see if that was on my plan. I told him that he had given me one the day before, and so he gave me one,no problem. We really liked the atmosphere of this hotel. It is very centrally located. You are within easy walking distance of the Puerta del Sol and Plaza Mayor.

The staff were very helpful and friendly throughout our stay. After asking to change rooms, due to a dull wall view room, we were told we could do the following day which we were happy with and glad we did as we got a city view room on the 7th floor which was lovely and more modern. The room was clean, bed was comfy and it was very quiet. We were slightly disappointed with breakfast, not realising that it was continental and would cost more for the hot buffet and the staff were not very attentive, but the coffee was good and we made up for eating in lovely places throughout our stay. The rooftop pool is lovely and it made our stay as it turned a city break into a relaxing summer holiday at the same time. There are plenty of sun loungers and towels. The pool is cold but very refreshing on a hot day and the views are amazing!! The hotel is located on the busy Gran Via with plenty of places to eat and drink and feels safe even at night. Head to El Corte Ingles (supermarket) for bottled water, only 32cent for 2litres. Turn left out of hotel and cross the street to find La Surena, sit outside and enjoy a bucket of beer and tapas for only 9euros. Go on a thu for Doble mania(2 tapas for 1). They have another in Cava Baja and just outside Plaza Mayor. TGI Fridays (close to La Surena) have happy hour Mon-Fri 5-8pm so a good starting point close to the hotel for a night out. We ate at many different places and think the best way is not to plan in advance and just see what you think looks good. We loved Cava Baja (a MUST at night,15min walk from hotel in Latin quarter). A street full of tiny little tapas bars where you can have a drink and a tapas then move on. We did the Madrid City Bus Tour which cost 20euros per person and we bought our tickets from the hotel reception. You can catch the bus across the road from the hotel, outside KFC, and can get on and off as you please. There are 2 routes and the ticket lets you do both. We chose to use this to get to Bernabeu Stadium which was a must see and enjoyable tour. Madrid is beautiful and there is lots to see including the Ratiro Park where you can hire a rowing boat for under 5euros for 45minutes which was lovely. We were a little concerned about pick pocketing but had no problems. My boyfriend carried is wallet in his front shorts pocket and I had a shoulder bag which I kept my hand on at all times, maybe sounds a little over the top but it was safe. Best to be aware of your surroundings at all times and during busy areas or sitting down outside keep hold of your belongings and you should be fine.

Check in was quick, and even though we arrived late morning and weren't expecting to be able to access the room till later, it was ready for us.

There were wine glasses and no wine...We stayed an hour and a half, with a group of around 5 English businessmen at close quarters talking loudly about their work (not their fault, but the room was so small that it wasn't really condusive to an \"inviting ambiance\"). No staff appeared during the time we were there, to replenish anything or tidy up. To cap it all, they were setting up a function room next door, so we were treated to furniture getting hauled about and loud bursts of music as they did the sound checks. Don't waste your money by upgrading to the Club Rooms at this hotel if your reason is to enjoy the Club Lounge - you'd be better off heading for a Madrid bar with the moneyyou save, as you'd have more drinks choices and a far better atmosphere. The Emperador could learn an awful lot from Marriott and Hilton as to how an executive lounge should be run.

The bed was a little on the small side. The bathroom had a hairdryer, bath over shower and toilletries that were replenished daily - even conditioner! Clean and modern. Of course the roof top pool is an added bonus, with lovely views and plenty of loungers. There is a bar there also. The pool is open until 9pm. We did not eat in the hotel, but the price of drinks were those of any city hotel. There are plenty of places to have breakfast nearby at cheaper prices than the hotel. It is easy to walk around Madrid but the metro is great too. It costs 1.5 euros per single journey, these can mount up so the tourist travel card for 13 euros for 2 days is good value. I wish we had bought it. A great restaurant we found was Casa Mona near the cable car. Just walk right from entrance and it's up a few streets along. It was trendy, quirky, full of locals and the cheapest and best food we had. I have no problem in recommending this hotel and would stay again.", "Date": "June 14, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Killarney, Ireland", "Title": "\u201cHighly reccommended\u201d", "Author": "Ritaod", "ReviewID": "UR131844173", "Content": "Two of us stayed here in June and found the hotel to be very good.

It was our first mother and daughter trip away and we were looking forward to it with great anticipation. The hotel was recomended by two sets of friends who we knew are very fussy where they stay and even though it was a few years ago when they stayed there, they were both very happy with the product. On their advice I also upgraded to the Emperador Club status which gives you an upgraded room plus complimentary drinks plus snacks & newspapers while you are staying there. The hotel itself is in a very convenient location - reception was decorated very nice and everything was very shiney and clean. However that is where I have to finish with the compliments as it the first time I have had to write a bad review like this - but I'm afraid someone at this hotel needs to hear. In all my travels around the world and in all the hotel's from 1 to 5 star grades that I have stayed in I have never ever come across a ruder and less helpfull set of staff in all my life. From the time we booked in to the time we left, it was like as if it was a burden or beneath them to answer simple mannerly questions not only to us but to several other guests we met while having our 4 days stay at the hotel The morning we arrived I asked for a recomendation for a nice restaurant for lunch as I wanted to treat my daughter to somewhere special on our first day in Madrid. The gentleman ( I use that term loosley) who was checking us in waved one hand in the air, and said \" Out the door, turn right and there's lots of nice restaurants up there on the plaza. When I asked him very quitely and mannerly could he recomend one that did good food with good service - his reply was \" They're all good \" . At this point let me reliably inform that same gentleman that they are NOT all good. However in a lovely art gallery just down from the Grand Via a very nice lady was more than helpfull, directed us to exactly what we were looking for. I would also like to point out that we were'nt even asked would we like help with our bags upstairs when we were booking in, which for a 4 come 5 star hotel is most unusual. That evening when we came back we went down for what we thought were our complimentary drinks before bed, only to be asked to pay. I informed the waiter that we had upgraded to the Emperador club and thought our drinks were complimentary - to which he replied - \" NO, your in the wrong place\". I asked where we were supposed to be and he said \" Ask at the reception\". So back up again I went to another Mr. Happy at reception who told me that I should have been told all this when I checked in. I told him that it was our first time both in Madrid and at the hotel and that we were told nothing but our room number when we had checked in that morning. He then tried to pass it off with another sweep of his hand saying that all the information was in the room. I told him the only information in our room was a book on the phone desk about the sights to see around Madrid. He then very abruptly then said \" Well it does'nt matter the Emperador Club is now closed for the night. So I paid for our drinks and went to bed. We eventually did find the Emperador Club the next evening after we came back from sightseeing - but - if your expecting the full selection of drinks they advertise on their website then you will again be very disapointed. If you dont drink Gin, Scotch, Beer or some very sweet Peach Liquer then you are out of luck, because those plus some soft drinks and water is all they have available. I did ask a lady who was there servicing the Club was this the full selection and she said yes. So if you, like my daughter and I, happen to drink wine then take my advice and dont bother upgrading to Club because it's a waste of money. However the last straw came the morning we were checking out and I was paying the bill. I, as I always do asked for a print out to keep for my records. I would like to say that the receptionist handed it to me - but unfortunately she did'nt. Instead she plonked it down very roughly in front of me with a pen alongside it. I presumed she wanted me to sign it and asked her where she wanted me to do so. Abruptly she said she did'nt need a signature, just my credit card which I had in my hand. I was just leaning forward to hand it to her when she abruptly snapped it out of my hand - and I do mean snapped. To say that I was left speechless is an understatement and my daughter who was standing behind me came forward and asked \" Did I just see what I saw her do\". I said yes and my daughter immediately asked for a comment card. At this stage the receptionist got very flustered and said at first that they were in the rooms. When my daughter told her that there was no information what so ever in our room she miraculousley found one which we filled up and posted at the desk. I really dont know if it was any use filling that card in because I doubt if it was ever even read as neither I or my daughter has heard anything back from the hotel as of yet. Please dont get me wrong Madrid is a beautiful city with very fine architecture, art galleries, bus tours and shopping and we did have a lovely time there - it's only a pity we stayed at the Emperador Hotel. I dont really dont know why they were so rude, whether it was the construction that was going on outside or whethere it was just that they were having a few bad days. What ever it was actually does'nt matter really because neither I or my daughter or any of my family or the friends that recomended it will EVER be staying at the Emperador Hotel again. I would also NOT under any circumstances what so ever recomend it to anyone else to stay there. Apologies again for the poor review but like I said before, this is the first time in my life that I felt I had to write such a bad review about such poor service.

It was certainly bigger than your average hotel room. It had begun to look a bit tired - old curtains and carpet etc, but not desperately in need of a refurb..yet. The two let-downs were, firstly, the bathroom had a bad smell of drains. We considered moving but we were only there for two nights and figured we could stick it out. Secondly, we had a nice view of the street below, but that meant it was quite noisy - general traffic and horns beeping etc. Again, not a dealbreaker and we stuck it out. Upsides are the location - if you don't fancy the short walk to most sights, the metro stop is right outside. Anywhere that still has coffee/tea facilities in the room also gets a bonus point in my book - too many places these days don't! We went on the romantic deal, which includes a bottle of cava, which was very nice and pretty good quality. I would probably stay again, but might look at other deals elsewhere first.

Right on the Gran Via, which I would say is on the nothern edge of the core of the city centre, within walking distance of everywhere. In our booking, we had requested a double bed, but we were shown to a room with two single beds. When enquiring about whether we could change rooms, it was possible, but we were told that we had been upgraded to a junior suite and another room would be a standard room facing the interior (the suite was facing the Gran Via). We therefore decided to stay, thinking we could push the beds together, but it later turned out that the beds were screwed into the wall (!) and immovable. At that point, we had used the room and it felt too late to change our minds and move anyway, so we ended up sharing a single bed the first night and sleeping in separate beds the second. Not ideal. The room was large, although it was of course a suite, and the bathroom was very nice. Good shower. The room decor was a bit dated and tired, though. If I had booked and paid for a suite in a 4-star hotel in a prime location, I probably would have expected more. Even at the rate we paid, one might have expected a more modern finish, but I appreciate that we booked during the expensive Easter period and that rates might be lower at other times. Staff were very nice, courteous and helpful at all times. My girlfriend speaks Spanish (and I kept quiet), so I don't know how it would have been if speaking English. The place has great potential.

Good value for the price; however, there are trade-offs (see food comment). Lobby Small-ish lobby; the staff were generally friendly and helpful. Very small gift shop and a bar. Conference rooms on the 2 second and 'basement' floors (although the conference rooms on the bottom are windowless). The conference room was fairly poor as they had large posts in the middle room. Room Room was small but average per European standards. Bathroom was average size. Internet was spotty (24-hour purchase) and somewhat unreliable. I had a room facing the Royal Palace (away from street) so the street-noise was minimal. The Royal Palace lights can be bright but they turn off at around midnight. Furniture is modern. Food The breakfast buffet was very disappointing. They had a limited selection of cold/hot food and baked goods. There was an omlet stand; however, it appeared that you needed a special ticket for this (which was not obvious). In addition, the omlet chef was not always present to cook the omlet.

The Emperador is in a fantastic central location on the Gran Via which gave us an easy walking distance to all the main attractions like the Prado and Thyssen-Bornemisza museums (about a 10-15 minute stroll) plus tapas bars and restaurants in the Centro and Chueca districts. The lobby is very grand and impressive, and the buffet breakfast provided was fine - basic continental breakfast of cereals, fruit juices, yogurts, breads, toaster, plus cold meats, fruit, tortilla, tomatoes and cheeses. The choice was OK, not outstanding but enough to fill you up for the day ahead. There was a cooked breakfast bar area, but you had to pay extra or be eligible for the Emperador Breakfast Bar ticket. Having that obviously gave you more, and a better choice, but the standard buffet is fine really, Our room was clean, serviceable, and OK, but it was on the shady side of the hotel, and without a balcony so I have to say it was a little gloomy at times. In fact the blackout curtains meant we overslept on a couple of occasions and only just made it down to breakfast before everything ran out. Ours was just a standard room, and this is a city centre hotel, so we didn't really expect too much in the way of views or terrace, and for all the time we spent in the room it was fine really, although the pillows were a funny long thin shape which meant a couple of restless nights. The staff were friendly and helpful, and services like air conditioning standard. The city bus tours stopped virtually opposite the hotel on the other side of Gran Via, so really easy to buy tickets for and board. What really sold it to us was the rooftop pool and bar area. It was lovely up there, with a large pool for proper lengths, and proper sun loungers plus towels provided. It was great to have the option to soak up some sun in between hitting the streets for some sightseeing. The pool area got busier as the day went on, so it's worth getting up there early, but thankfully there was no need for any towel bagging sun loungers, there were enough for everyone. My one criticism was that there was limited shade available, and no umbrellas provided, so you have to be a real sun worshipper to brave it! But worth the trip up even just for lunch at the shady bar and the fabulous views over Madrid's city rooftops. For what it was (ie a city centre hotel, with no pretensions) the Emperador was fine, but the pool made it a great choice for us, as well as the central location. For restaurants we would recommend La Chata in Casa Baia (Centro) as authentically Spanish with great local food, and Barraca in Chueco for plentiful paella.", "Date": "August 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manchester, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGreat staff, clean and quiet.\u201d", "Author": "nadso68", "ReviewID": "UR116096370", "Content": "Stayed for three nights in July 11.

We were visiting family who lived nearby in another part of the city. We opted for this hotel as we couldn't find any others within the same area with a swimming pool, so it stood out for us. We also liked the central location of the hotel. We booked two rooms, one for myself and my partner and the other for his mother. The lobby of the hotel is impressive and very clean and the reception staff were very welcoming. The two rooms were booked on the same floor which I was pleased with. Our first impression of the room was that it did lack space and was a little 'dated' but at least it was clean and comfortable. The bed could have also done with a couple of extra pillows as we only had one smallish pillow each. Initially I was very disappointed with the view as our room was at the back of the hotel and facing other rooms, however it actually became an advantage to us as the room was cooler, plus you didn't have the noise of people and traffic outside (every cloud and that). The food and drinks within the hotel were very pricey so we never ordered anything there. I'm not tight but do know the true price of things and it makes no sense to me to pay way over the odds for something that you could get the fraction of the price elsewhere. Thankfully, there was a Starbucks just across the road from the hotel which came in handy in the mornings and that was a lot cheaper, which I think is really telling you the expense of eating and drinking at the hotel. Although it is not unusual for hotels to have extortionate prices where their food and drink is concerned. The rooftop garden and pool was absolutely amazing and I think really makes this hotel.

They finished what the were doing, before the even acknowledged we were standing there. When we asked about the advert on the reception desk for a club upgrade, it was like getting blood out of a stone, finding out what it included, so we decided to pass on this. We were not offered a porter to take the luggage (something that we are not too bothered about but you would normally expect in a 4 star), We walked into a dark shoebox of a room (bathroom was nice) and our friends room was even smaller. We decided to go back and view the club upgrade room which was far nicer and overlooking the Gran Via (with good soundproofing), we asked again what else it included and received a very grumpy response. The porter showed us to the room and was a breath of fresh air, he showed us the club area, where you can get soft drinks, beer and a rather odd choice of spirits, as well as nibbles, between 12 and 11pm. I would recommend upgrading because you will spend way more that 35 euros if you order drinks in the hotel. A litre of water being 9 Euros and a vodka (no mixer) 13 Euros. They say that you are not allowed to take your drinks out of the club room but we took them discreetly up to the pool and were never challenged. Top tip....take a bottle opener! Do not bother eating in the hotel, whilst it is not too expensive, it's not great and as soon as you have a drink with it, the price soars. Soft drinks were nearly 5 Euros. I ordered pizza with proscutto, it came out as margarita. When I pointed this out, they took it back and within minutes I had the pizza with processed cold ham thrown on top. Decided to put that down to experience and just not go back. Friend ordered nachos and for nearly 7 Euros, she was lucky enough to get a plate of doritos and some runny cheese. No salsa, guacamole, or any other garnish. Just squeezy cheese and chips. Service is not great, whilst they serve drinks by the pool, it takes some time to attract attention and then for them to arrive. The staff were very nice up there but just not very effective. On a positive note, the pool was lovely and so were the views from the 10th floor and the hotel is perfectly situated in the middle of most things, with the tour bus stopping just across the street. We grabbed coffee and breakfast from Starbucks each morning, which is right across the road and a damn sight cheaper! You will also need to be up on the roof terrace to bag your lounger with a towel before midday or risk not getting one, particularly at the weekend. This is because the hotel allow non residents to use the facilities for 44 Euro. Not a problem if you're successful with getting a sunbed but something I would have been annoyed about had I not, which did happen to those wanting to sunbathe in the afternoon on Saturday and Sunday. If you want internet access, pop across the road for free wifi in McDonalds as you will pay 13.95 euros for a day in the hotel.

Also, the breakfast is not always included, and it costs 15 euros per person: 15 euros for having bad coffee, some scambled eggs and low-quality cheese and tasteless pastry and fruits... Moreover, the hotel staff does not speak English neither French, which is a real problem if you are not Spanish-speaker. Furthermore, in the rooms, you don't have a lot of choice of TV programs; almost all the channels are in Spanish... Nevertheless, this hotel has an excellent location, on Gran Via, Madrid's Champs Elys\u00e9es/ 5th Avenue! Five minutes from the hotel by walk, you have the \"Puerta del Sol\", the center of Madrid. If you don't want to walk, you have always a lot of taxis near the hotel. But you also need only five minutes to go by walk from the hotel to the \"Chueca\", the very trendy district of Madrid where everybody is going out at night (in fact, it is the gay district, and all the bars and nightclubs - for gay and straight people - are there). By the way, if you are a clubber or nightlife-fan, the best club of Madrid, the Club Cool, is just behind the hotel... Finally, if you consider the location as an important thing during your trip, Hotel Emperador remains a pretty good deal, because everything is close when you are there.

The reception staff at the hotel were excellent and although I speak a little Spanish it was not necessary as all the staff are fluent in English and are very helpful.

We had breakfast a couple of mornings at the hotel as this was part of our package and found the food to be adequate, although I do not think I would pay the 18 Euros asked as there are numerous places on Gran Via which offer breakfast at half the price. Having booked a suite we had access to the Emperador lounge which proved to be a bonus as it was usually very quiet and one could just sit quietly and read the daily papers,only moan about the lounge was that they did not serve wine!!! only exec lounge I have been in any where in the free world which did not offer this facility, drinks on offer were whisky, gin a couple of liquers and plenty of soft drinks and water so if you are looking for some free vino you are out of luck at this hotel.

I booked this hotel based on the others' great reviews, and was definitely disappointed! I had wanted a nice, clean, 4 star hotel to end the last 3 days of our trip, but... When we checked in, we were asked if we wanted to upgrade our room for another 20 EUR. We declined, and I feel like we were given the worst room available. The room was so small that when you open the door, the bed is right there. There was barely any room to place our luggage. What's worst though is the sewage smell that was so foul and instantly noticeable upon opening the door! It felt so disgusting, but it was late afternoon and we were anxious to take advantage of the last few daylight hours on the rooftop pool. So we turned on the AC in the room and went up to the pool. Luckily, upon returning, the AC helped clear the smell. We suspect that the room hasn't been occupied in a long time (hence, again, the suspicion that our decline to the upgrade led us to this unused closet of a room). This room also didn't feel very clean. The carpet feels very dirty, and the bathroom is very old. There's a loose tile on the floor that creaks everything you walk on it. The only positive amenity to this hotel is the rooftop pool, although I wish they'd add a hot tub since there is such a large space available. Service is also poor. I found the staff to be very snobby. Also, during our check-out, we asked the front desk to check which terminal our airline flies out of, as they're pretty far stops on the subway. He told us the wrong one, so we arrived 1/2 hour later. Luckily, we're the types that like to arrive 3 hrs early to the airport!

We got a great rate including breakfast and wanted to be in the city centre with access to a pool so it was perfect for us. However if either of those things are not important to you there are much better hotels to stay in. The location is superb - you are right on Gran Via the main thoroughfair in the city - think Picadilly Circus if you are staying in London. So you are walking distance of EVERYTHING you need to see. Tourist bus stops opposite and you are directly next to a choice of metro stations too. Literally LOADS of restaurants in walking distance, gorgeous Tapas places on pedestrianised streets, walking to Plaza Mayor or steps from the hotel to the Spanish offshoot of 'Pizza Express' (come out turn left) or opposite that is TGI Fridays if you are unadventerous. There is no tea and coffee making in the room so you'll appreciate the Starbucks that is opposite! I found the check-in staff really rude and obnoxious - no eye contact, no conversation, didnt even give the key to me or speak to me - gave the key to the bell boy and walked off! Very rude! The breakfast staff were good and the breakfast buffet was excellent - the addition of a chilled bottle of Cava (not champagne as others have said) was a lovely way to start the day. Mixed with peach juice for a Bellini or OJ for a Bucks Fizz was a lovely way to start the day every day. The room is definately 3 star, very basic with small windows and low ceilings nothing special at all but the food and choice was excellent every morning. The pool was fantastic, it is so high up that you look out over the other buildings and statues - it is one of the most lovely pools we've been in - it was such a welcome relief after a hard day of sight seeing to jump in the pool. Towels provided and lots of loungers available. Do check it is open when you are going though as you will be disappointed if it is shut when you go. If you want to hire a car the hotel is directly opposite an AVIS shop which was very handy for us, we had hired a car for the next leg of our journey but decided to pick it up a few days later from the office opposite the hotel rather than paying the extortiante amount to park the car in the hotel. You really do NOT need a car when you stay here as you can get public transport everywhere. Even getting a cab from the airport in rush-hour worked out cheaper than paying parking! The rooms are ok, nothing special, comfortable rooms with nice comfy beds, TVs (nothing english), safe, big bathroom etc. But be warne, the most important thing to say when you check in is \"Last time I stayed the room had a terrible smell, please make sure I do not have a smelly room\". The woman checking in next to me said this and I'm sure she was fine - our room had a weird mixture of bad drains and air freshner trying to disguise it! I had read on Trip Advisor about the smelly rooms but didnt think it woudl be a problem - but it's not great, We were on level 5 in a room looking into a dark atrium in the middle of the hotel and the room had an odd drain smell - worse in the afternoon. We were only spending 3 nights and were out most of the time so it didnt really bother us but if you were staying any longer or had a sensitive nose do ask for a non smelly room. I think it's just poor drainage - it's not really awful but not too pleasant. If you want to be in the middle of everything and you want to be able to swim then this should be your first choice if you can get a good rate, if you dont need to swim there are better hotels on Gran Via and further out of the area for cheaper.", "Date": "July 27, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brussels, Belgium", "Title": "\u201cGreat pool - great location - pay extra for clubroom\u201d", "Author": "piboBelgium", "ReviewID": "UR70789872", "Content": "As other reviewers have said, the location of this hotel can't be better (central on the gran via) and the pool rooftop is really great.

We didn't get the travel pass advised by many as it was so easy to walk everywhere.

Probably proper luggage would make it trickier. Hotel Emperador has a stylish lobby, deliciously cool, with very helpful staff who all seem to speak good English. Our room (on seventh floor) was perfect - marble bathroom - TV (could only get Sky news but too much to see outside). Very efficient but quiet air con. Our room had balcony overlooking side road but with two layers of double glazing doors could not hear anything.

Room was always immaculate when we returned from our museum trail. Probably all this applies to any one of other 4* hotels in the area BUT - no other hotel has a swimming pool (and I do mean swimming not splash) on its top floor!

Spend the day seeing remarkable paintings and palaces and walking round Madrid In 33+degrees and then scoot up to the roof - pick up your burgundy beach towel and dive into that lovely, clean, swimming pool and then chill on a lounger and read or people watch!

We decided to spend a long weekend in Madrid to visit some friends and booked the Emperador to check if it would be ok for our summer trip. On my arriving someone helped me at the main door with my luggage and waited nearby while I checked in and helped again to the room. The room was perfectly ok (I've added some photographs), with a double bed, a sofa, a smal armchair, minibar, tv and desk. In the corridor (with a door to separate from bedroom) there's a wardrobe with a safe and a rack for suitcase. The bathroom was big enough, clean and not cold. I didn't actually touch the radiator but temperature in the bathroom was ok. It wasn't a bedroom with a view as it was an interior one but I prefer to be away from the noisy Gran Via anyway. There're no ironboard or coffe/tea facilities as it's not usual in Spain (same as very rarely hotels in UK have a minibar). We didn't tried the bar but it looked a quiet and nice area to have a drink and a chat. The swimming pool was obviously closed at this time of the year but we were given all kind of explanations to our enquiries for our future staying. We didn't have breakfast at the hotel and we used to have it at VIPS nearby. I like this hotel and we definitely will be back in July. The only negative remark is that it's not soundproofing at all (the door between the actual bedroom area and the door to the main corridor helps but we had a couple of German guys next door and they arrived late at night (3ish), quite drunk and noisy so it was quite annoying).", "Date": "February 6, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Munich", "Title": "\u201cGood place to stay.\u201d", "Author": "DMadB", "ReviewID": "UR50986516", "Content": "Has been a real good time.

We decided to stay at the Emperador Hotel for one very simple reason, we were going to be there during Aug and Sept and needed a pool. This was the only hotel is a great location with a pool. And if you are planning to be in Madrid during the hot summer months than you definitely need to stay here. The pool is amazing. It is located on the roof of the hotel and you can see the whole city 360 degrees. Sure there is a fake green grass look and the chairs are a bit cluttered but all in all the pool area is great. I did not order from the bar but instead brought my own booze in a bag and asked for a glass of ice. Not that I am cheap but lets face it, Madrid is not cheap. So lets start from the beginning. Got off the airplane, took forever to get baggage, followed the signs down to the metro and purchased the 10 ride pass. You so need to do this if you plan to get around Madrid. The metro system is off the hook! We never waited more than a minute for a train. Okay so the metro guy told us to get off at Plaza de Espana, but since I am a librarian and think I know everything I decided to get off at Santo Domingo. NOTE: THERE ARE NO ESCALATORS AT SANTO DOMINGO. YOU WILL NEED TO CARRY ALL YOUR LUGGAGE UP THE STAIRS! AND THERE ARE SO MANY STAIRS. However you end up being right in front of the hotel. If you care to get off at Plaza de Espana, they have escalators and it is a two block walk. The metro starts running at 6 am FYI. Check in: Great, they gave us a room up high and we were on our way. Now we expected it to be an old hotel and were expecting the worst. We had a triple room and were extremely worried that we would be cramped. Not at all! The room had two closets, a safe, a hallway, and the beds were all spaced accordingly. There was a desk, a sitting chair and several furniture pieces for clothing items. The bathroom was large and there were plenty of towels. The room was very clean. We left every morning very early because it was a non stop action and when we returned mid day our room was always clean. I have super bad sinuses and need to sleep with the window open rather than the air on, and if you plan to do this you need EARPLUGS. It is so loud on the street. We would get in around two or three in the morning, and people in Madrid are out until the sun rises. They love to honk their horns, scream, and have a good time. Earplugs are needed. But if you can sleep with the windows shut then you will be fine. The location in on the Gran Via, and about four blocks to the right when you exit the lobby is Corte Ingles. On the very bottom floor, the basement, Corte Ingles has a supermarket, so go there to buy all your snacks and wine and gifts to bring home. I bought tons of sausages home. And of course ham. Follow the metro map and you can get anywhere. The hotel is in a great location and I would definitely stay here again.

We like to walk, whenever possible to the sites, so a central location is critical for us. As has been mentioned before, this hotel is on the gran via, and it was a great location to walk around Madrid from. I don't remember the food (we ate breakfast there once) being that great. After the first night, we just stocked up from the local conveinence stores to eat the next morning. We had a fridge, and it made the trip much more affordable. I would consider staying there again, if I had to go to Madrid. Some thoughts on Madrid: I was shocked that many of the Churches were simply closed for most of the day. Unlike several other Europea cities I've been to, most of the churches were closed except for Mass and very limited visitation times. Any trip must include the Prado (art museum) - it was one of the best - if not the best - I've ever been to. The Egyptian monument/temple (I forget the name) was free, and worth it as well.

So we obviously know the area extremely well, and being in August, we thought the kids would enjoy the rooftop pool in 40C weather (good thing we did, because there was a heat wave the day we arrived). The A/C actually works quite well. Reception was incredibly impersonal for a 4* hotel. We had three rooms on the same floor and they apparently upgraded us to club (which we appreciated due to the added security of an extra door, but we didn't used the lounge or anything like that) Breakfast was quite nice, especially for us Spanish born, all of our favourite things were available! Although again, the A/C was extremely strong (OK for American standards) The pool is, on paper and on site, extraordinary in size. Never seen a pool this large on a rooftop (close to 20m in length and almost 3m deep at one end), with a lifeguard (mandatory in Spain). The problem is that the whole deck/terrace surrounding the pool was chock-full, thankfully we only went late afternoon, when all the sun-crazed cancer seeking people started to leave. The bar rates are outrageously expensive (4EUR for a Coke), particularly knowing that most of the customers were residents. There were lockers in the changing rooms but my son and nephew did not think of locking their things. And sure enough, one watch (no huge cash value), and a t-shirt (definitely no cash value), were stolen. In itself, it was obviously our own fault, but I totally hated the pool employees telling me \"oh this is the FIRST time this has ever happened\" Come on!!! (we did see a group of young men who clearly were not staying at the hotel, probably the staff's buddies, who came and went). We were then told the hotel manager would come and talk to us, which he/she never ever did. So, even if legally they are not responsible for this, they obviously don't even care. Also, if you are allergic or have respiratory problems, this is NOT the pool to go to, as there is a very high level of pollution, and mixed with hot air, it can probably get you killed. I have no particular problems and couldn't stay very long because my throat was stinging and I started to have a dry cough.

Our room was horrible. It was much much smaller than the internet pictures suggested and it had twin beds even though we\u2019d specifically booked a double. The only sign it was a club room was a large elaborate chandelier which dwarfed the room and looked ridiculous. We called reception, who were very off handed and told us there was nothing they could do as the hotel was fully booked, we weren\u2019t happy so were told they \u2018might be able to move us to a double if we rang again the next day\u2019. We were pretty fed up so tried to cheer ourselves by going up to the roof top pool. The pool itself looked fine but it was extremely messy around the pool area, it wasn\u2019t a relaxing space at all. I know it\u2019s not the fault of the staff if customers move sun beds or leave litter, but I think it unacceptable in a hotel of this class that they don\u2019t employ someone to have an occasional tidy up. Next we went to the club lounge. First - it\u2019s not a \u2018lounge\u2019 at all, but a curtained off area of a breakfast room. Second \u2013 it made the pool area look pristine! The bar was covered with litter, half full glasses and decaying snacks. There\u2019s no way I would have wanted to drink there. We\u2019d seen enough. We went to the Room Mate Laura (where we\u2019ve stayed before); they were fully booked but the friendly receptionist called their sister hotel Room Mate Mario who booked us in for the next two nights so we only had to spend one night at the Emperador. At Mario we were up graded from an executive room to a huge junior suite and our stay cost us less that half what the Emperodor would have cost! I\u2019ve read reviews on here from people who\u2019ve had a good stay at the Emperador so some of their rooms must be nice, but my advice would be not to risk it. At the prices they charge all their rooms should be nice, their public areas better cared for and receptionists more civil. The only plus points were - the location (though the Room Mate Mario was only 5 minutes away on a much quieter street behind the opera house), one out of three receptionists we spoke to was perfectly friendly and efficient (too little too late), our bathroom was perfectly adequate, our room had a tiny balcony with a good view.

Facing the wall actually worked in our favour to be honest because the \"air conditioning\" seemed to be set to heat no matter how low it was on, so we were forced to have the window open, but because we weren't on the street there was no noise whatsoever! The bathroom was pleasantly surprising in terms of being a reasonable size with what seemed to be fairly new fittings. I wouldn't personally class this hotel as a 4 star, but I know it's based on ameneities, and in theory, the Emperador has a lot. What we were after was a good location and you don't get much better than being towards the top end of Gran Via.

The walls in this hotel are like wet toilet paper. We heard EVERYTHING going on on the entire floor. The maids were super loud every morning and I could hear them yelling outside my door every morning starting promptly at 0730 hours. After complaining, I didn't hear them yelling, I just heard them blaring over their walkie talkies. Every time a door slammed (which was often) I could hear it rattle my room. Basically, I was up every morning at 8 am because I didn't have a choice. They apparently were also doing some type of construction, as I heard drilling and hammering in adjacent rooms alllllllll day, every day. There was basically no sleeping in, and no quiet peace in the room during the day. Now, my mother has also stayed in this hotel before and says it was very quiet, so I apparently was very very unlucky.

We were a group of 7 girls and stayed at the Emperador this weekend on a hen party (a sophisticated, relaxing one!). We had two twin rooms and a triple. Our 3rd floor rooms were very varied - one large with a lovely view (321), one smaller also with a good view of the gran via (327), and one small with a view of the opposite wall (320) but all rooms were clean, tastefully decorated and even the small room was a comfortable size. Plenty of wardrobe space and general storage, a tv, a radio/cd player, good size bathroom (with good selection of toiletries). The shower is okay. Good water pressure and temperature, but quite a small shower head with thin water jets, which was a bit disappointing. Housekeeping was very good. The air conditioning was excellent. Very efficient - meaning we didn't need to leave it whilst we were out (which is a pet hate of mine - excess energy consumption and all that!) We paid a supplement for the Club Emperador rooms, which got us more spacious rooms (although we didn't see the other rooms) and a seperate lounge/breakfast room. There was a larger selection of breakfast foods (which was excellent in both the standard dining room and the club room). The lounge also provided free drinks during certain hours (alcoholic and soft drinks) and although not a wide selection, was great for the group congregating before going out for dinner. The rooftop pool area is lovely. Great views. The pool is a good size so you can have a proper swim, but be warned, it's very chilly!!! It's breezy up there, but for us that provided a welcome cooling from the hot sun!There are plenty of loungers and towels are provided up there. It was busy on the weekend but much quieter on the Monday. The pool bar is also good and does lounger service at certain times. It's quite pricey, but that's to be expected in a hotel (6 euros for soft drinks). There's a good changing area, which is handy if you want to relax after checkout and shower/change. The pool itself is open to the public at some times. There are 3 lifts...small but relatively quick. Two are facing the main lobby, a 3rd is just round the side to the left, which is less used and arrives much faster! This doesn't go up to the pool though. The staff were attentive and helpful. They helped us a lot by making calls for us in Spanish, to check our lost luggage. Their English was also very good. The concierges were very helpful. We did encounter quite a few problems at check-out, which delayed us by an hour! We were charged different rates from those we'd booked at, had extra breakfasts charged but the person who did the booking had printed all our info out so we were ok eventually! I'd just advise checking your printed invoice carefully before paying. Overall, a very nice hotel and I'd definitely stay there again and recommend it to people.

Getting to the hotel is very simple. From Barajas Terminal 4 you can get the Metro straight into the city for next to nothing and is relatively quick. I went to Madrid last year and had to get a bus to the other terminals but they have now extended the line to Terminal 4 saving lots of time. The Metro station Santo Domingo is more ort less right outside the hotel although we found it easier to use Callao and walk as Line 2 seemed very quiet compared to Line 5. From the outside it looks very impressive looking directly out on to the Grand Via with a large revolving door to enter through. Checking in was quick and simple and cannot fault the service, I requested the football tickets to be delievered to the hotel before my arrival and indeed the hotel had put them aside for me (much to my relief as they had cost a small fortune and the game was only 2 hours away at the time). 2 small lifts in the main lobby were available although believe there were more lifts round the side but can be a problm at check out time when the lift is taken up completely but one family with luggage and is not that quick either. We had booked a triple room and were up on the 6th floor. Initial impressions were good, a small hallway took us into the room, triple was indeed 3 single beds which is what was hoped for although the room was actually a twin room with a temporary bed rolled in (unfortunately for me I got that one), in saying that though the bed was quite comfy and slept soundly on it. The room had plenty of space, somewhere to hang shirts but maybe could have done with a few more hangers (something I'm sure you can request from reception), a safe was available but needed a key to unlock from the inside so not sure if this was a cost option or not so did not use it, the air conditioning was excellent and cooled the room down very quickly, the bathroom had a bath or shower and was perfectly adequate even for 3 needing to share but the toilet was a little awkward to get on properly. We had a view to the side of the hotel so were just slightly off the main road but the noise could still be heard even on the 6th floor (mainly sirens rather than the traffic itself though) but did keep one of us up most of the night. The location though for getting round Madrid is excellent as its right in the middle of the city and pretty much everything is accessible on foot but the Metro is quick and effecient too. Breakfast was included in the price and was a very large selection of cereals, cold meats, pastries, bread rolls, cheese, fruit and hot breakfasts in the form of bacon, sausages and scrambled eggs. It can get quite busy so be prepared to wait in line before someone takes a room number and sits you down, especially if you are a large group. The lobby area is very relaxing for having a quick drink before going out if a tad expensive and we also sampled the rooftop terrace complete with swimming pool but it was a little cold at the time to go in so stuck with a light lunch instead which was very nice but if again a little expensive. All in all I suppose this would be the only real problem wth the hotel, we paid a total of \u00a3314 (originally \u00a3330 through Airmiles but got the reduction) for the room for 2 nights which is fine when split between 3 but may be a bit slightly overpriced for the room itself.

I was grudgingly given another room to look at, which although bigger was equally dark and uninspiring and was on another floor away from our other friends. Their rooms were not much better and one had big problems with the shower. Worse than that was the service - extremely slow, un customer friendly and even rude. This especially seemed to appy up in the pool bar where, apart from one young waiter who was new and lovely, we felt completely invisible.

Fortunately, the hotel has double windows which were very effective at blocking out any noise. I'm a very light sleeper and never heard a thing. The Emperador is in a perfect location to enjoy the city either on foot or via the cheap (1 Euro), efficient Metro. There's a Metro stop literally right in front of the hotel. The only time we took taxis was to and from the airport, and even that trip could have been done on the subway. The decor of the rooms themselves appears to be dated, but I think this is just the style and not that it's actually old. The mattress is very firm - which is my preference. I think this was the most comfortable bed I've slept on in a long time. Rooms have a mini-bar and a safe (free to use, but you do have to get a key from the front desk). We had upgraded to the \"bed and breakfast\" package. Turned out to be a great bargain. Not only was the breakfast better than what was in the main dining room (and with free cava as well) but we also had access to a \"club room\" that opened at noon each day with unlimited beer on tap, light snacks, soft drinks, bottled water and a handful of flavored liqueurs. We found that between the free breakfast and the snacks, we generally did not need to buy lunch anywhere, making the extra charge for this package well worth it. It was also nice to hit the club room and relax a bit after a day of sightseeing and walking. Another great feature of this hotel is the rooftop pool - but note that the water isn't heated and it was cold!!! On a side note which has nothing to do with the hotel itself, my husband did get his wallet lifted on the Metro.

I was robbed in the first hour I was there. I have been going to Europe for over 25 years including backing around Africa, its bad.

It's a shame the pool wasn't open when we stayed but we still had an amazing time. The location of the hotel is great, you can walk to the Puerto Del Sol in 5/10mins, get a metro right outside the hotel or hop on a (red route) tour bus also right outside!

We could only speak about 3 words in Spanish when we went but everyone was so helpful & nearly all the restaurant have menus in English & if they didn't they tried their best to translate the whole menu for you! A word of advice about the museums, check when they're open before you set off, we went to the Prado, Reina Sof\u00eda & the Thyssen-Bornemisza on I think it was Monday, only to realise all the museums are shut on Mondays!

However, if it is not going to be hot during your stay, I would suggest staying somewhere else. My family and I stayed for three nights in two double club-level rooms. The access to the club room was worth it -- we went through about eight free bottles of water daily, and in the evenings the option was there to stop by for a complimentary cocktail or beer. One room had a king bed and the other two twins. All the room problems stemmed from the twin room. For starters, the chandelier in the room (the primary source of light) was broken so the room was darker than the king room, and no attempts were made to fix the problem. More importantly, the a/c was not functioning properly. Someone came to \"fix\" it twice, but there was no major improvement. While the fan appeared to blow a little stronger with every mechanic visit, the unit was not de-humidifying the air, giving the room a somewhat damp feel. Our second day we were offered a different room on the same floor (7), but that room was even hotter than the original. The following day we were offered a room on the eighth floor which was a major improvement. It was slightly bigger with a sitting area, and it had working a/c. To our surprise, that room was stocked with Hermes brand toiletries because it was a club level room, but our rooms on the seventh floor (club level) had standard toiletries. We complained to the front desk and the seventh floor maid begrudgingly handed over the premium stuff (!). In general the rooms and bathrooms were at least clean. The lobby was depressing, though. The floral arrangement was old by the time we arrived, and they let it continue to wilt until our last night. The ceiling desperately needs a coat of paint or two to hide the permanent shadows/burns from the lights. The \"gym\" is a joke. Service was polite but hapless and clueless.
