It's located at the Sirkeci district, which area is ideal for many reasons. Important sites like \"Hagia Sophia\", \"Underground Cisterns\", \"Topkapi-Palace\", \"Blue Mosque\" and an \" Archaelogical Museum \" -from where one finds for example Babylonian artifacts- are just by few minutes walking distance from the \"Best Nobel-Hotel\". Bosphorus is just some stone-throw away with lots of many boats criss-crossing with wonderful sights around. Small room DIDN'T bother me personally AT ALL, because I just slept, washed myself, changed clothes and fixed bought items there etc.. Most of the time I was out, so there wasn't REAL necessity for a larger room in MY case. There was a TV, free safety-box and shower in the toilet plus towels (which were changed DAILY like beds make-up) and soap. That's basically all I need, but I'm only writing on behalf of my needs, not someone else's - these things may VARY according to individuals, some may require more space to move but I think my room was one of those smaller ones. If there's a dead fly in the corner or odd-coloured tapestry etc., who cares? Staying is only temporary - besides I spent couple of nights off.. Hotel was easy to come and go despite it's being situated on the area where are lots of people, traffic and many, many other Hotels. Those were also mainly of medium-sizes or smaller, not these giant \"Hyatts\" or \"Radissons\" etc. which were mostly to be found on \"Taksim\"-area with their Congress-Centers and so on. Personnel was decent and friendly. Breakfast was good (buffet) in Turkish style with 'Mehmet' taking good care of it with his smile. Things like Laundry (cheap), Hamam and Coiffeur were practically next-door to \"Best Nobel-Hotel\". Excellent air-conditioned Tramway-system works about 200 meters away all-day long. They are mostly - though not always, crowded - but they are constantly in motion, one doesn't need to wait for long next tram. Just choose your deodorant and you'll fit in! What comes to noises - WHO said that the Town with approximately 12-16 MILLION (!!) people is SILENT? In my room there were no disturbing noises despite of the busyness of the City - I don't mind that so much on vacation. All kinds of Shops and services like Photography, Pharmacies etc. are nearby and the Sirkeci-area is FULL of all kinds of restaurants - like Istanbul in general. There's ALWAYS some nice place for each \"sizes\" of wallets - no worry!. Bazars, near-the Bridge(s) market places, Squares and many Mosques are within walking distance. Besides Yellow-Cabs, Metro is great (test Funicular-ride to Taksim) and even Buses of various kinds works relatively well - so there's no problem in moving around in Istanbul! Also recommended is a visit to \"Princes Islands\" by boat - a nice trip and beautiful island(s) with plenty of services! Stay overnight. All in all, Istanbul was a pleasant surprise to be such a BIG City - felt safe there (probably peoples behavior in general). I can recommend \"Best Nobel-Hotel\" for couples and particularly for sole-travelers as a well-grounded choice - specially in the sense of Price-Quality-Location relation. Almost into the same breathe it has to be mentioned that English Company called \"JustinTime.com Hotels\" proved to be well capable of arranging a room quite SOON with the reasonable price-level if one is late, or (suddenly) decides to reserve a Hotel-room, for example just a few days prior to departure.
