The bedroom was spacious with a flat screen TV too. The only comment I would make is that the cleanliness could be better. The breakfast was basic but it's all you need, cereal, toast, cold meat, cheese, yoghurts, teas, coffees and fresh juice.

Even a 2*can burn a hole in your pocket but this was an exception to the rule 2 nights for \u00a3100 I was a bit wary but then again all we really wanted was somewhere to rest our heads and clean ourselves up. For the 2* hotel I have to say we were quite surprised how nice things were. We arrived at 11am and were able to check in straight away which is always a good start. We had a room on the 1st floor which was right next to the lift the view of the room was of a leisure centre that was originally a bath house and it still has parts of its original outer. The room was more than adequate with a large sized bathroom with an over bath shower, basin and WC, there was a good size double bed and there was adequate storage (Wardrobe, cupboard and draws). The room had a wall mounted flat screen TV (with Freeview), this had no remote however but was still workable. The room also had a hairdryer and a kettle. They were a bit stingy on the tea and coffee left, however reception were more than happy to give you more if you asked. The only complaint with the room was being front facing you could hard traffic noise but after a while you tend not to notice. The room was cleaned daily to a high standard. The breakfast wasn\u2019t brilliant but was adequate enough. It was continental with a choice of a couple of cereals, toast, ham, chicken, cheese and yogurts with tea, coffee and orange juice to drink you could have as much as you wished. It was a bit of a shame that it was only server till 9:00 when you are away on a chilling out weekend sometimes its nice to be able to sleep in a bit. If you miss breakfast or desire a full English there are plenty of cafes and bars between the hotel and reaching the main shopping centre. The staff were very friendly and spoke good English even though it was obvious that it wasn\u2019t their first language for most of them. What I think the hotel lacks is a bar, there was a huge lobby and a 24 hour reception that was often quiet, I feel that they could operate a bar here and it be quite successful. For a drink to bring back however there is a Sainsbury\u2019s local and Tesco express in less than a 2 min walk. The hotel had adequate parking, however going away for the weekend the last thing I want to do is drive so public transport is my choice. For public transport the hotel is \u00be of a mile from Stratford (central line, DLR and mainline) station and \u00bd a mile to Maryland mainline station. It is a flat walk past mainly shops in a well lit open area so seems as safe as anywhere. There was also a bus stop outside the hotel with 2 bus routes that would take you to the college in 3 mins for Maryland or the main shopping centre in 5 mins for Stratford. You can also stay on the bus to Bow road in about 10 mins and catch a district or Hammersmith and city tube if you are going elsewhere. We never waited more than 5 mins for a bus either way. If you buy a travel card you can use the busses, trains and tubes as often as you like in a day and Subject to any disasters you can easily be in central London in 20-30 minutes. If you are intend on using a travel card the next day, one tip I would give you is to buy the travel card the day before at a station as you cannot purchase these on the bus and its likely you may want to take a bus to a station as your first call from the hotel. On checkout the staff are perfectly happy to store your baggage so you can enjoy your day before you head off home. Stratford itself had a large shopping centre (next to the tube station) with supermarkets and your usual high street shops, this is next to the tube station and the building remains open 24 hours. The outside is being done up for the Olympics so looks a bit like a building site but inside is fine. Outside the shopping centre you seem to get different people screaming about different religions. They can seem quite intimidating and nasty but if you just walk on by they do not approach you. The Olympic park is also next door to the tube station which is worth just having a look at even from a distance. This has advantage Stratford with the area being cleaned up and the station being modernised and many other improvements made. I would have no issues with staying at this hotel again in the future especially if they keep their prices reasonable, I\u2019m sure they will rocket during the Olympics but outside that period hopefully not.", "Date": "March 12, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cA decent budget option\u201d", "Author": "tripaddvisor", "ReviewID": "UR123075562", "Content": "Considering the price, there wasn't really much to fault with our stay at the Viking Hotel.

Disappointing and Quite Poor aspects of our stay: Reception staff did not inform us as to the start and end time of breakfast (07:15 - 09:00) so, even though continental breakfast was included in the price, we did not benefit as we turned up in the Dining area just at 09:05. Breakfast was completely cleared away. We felt this was a particularly early time for breakfast to end especially on a Sunday, which it was. When approached to ask about breakfast, Staff in the Dining area were disinterested and unhelpful - quite abrupt, verging on rudeness and staff in reception area just shrugged their collective shoulders, without a hint of an apology when it was pointed out that they had not advised us of breakfast timings when we'd booked in the previous day.

However, it is located in Stratford which is understandable, a place you don't add to the tourist itinerary (and the Olympics are really going to be here!!!!). Before they built the new Westfield shopping centre which has just opened you could get the bus straight to Stratford station to jump on the central line or DLR into town. This isn't the case now. Best option is probably to get the 25 bus to Mile End tube or take it all the way into town (Oxford Circus or Holborn terminii). However, the traffic congestion that can occur at the roundabout in Stratford means you could well be on the 25 for an hour and a half when the tube takes 20 mins. Either way the bus stop is 40 yards down the road and the 25's run regularly day and night so getting back to the hotel is no problem.

Strange thing is that there aren't blankets in the room so we used the bed covers. Plenty of small shops in the area which is not the best one in London but is OK.

I think the standard price for rooms per night is around \u00a360, which isn't bad for London Prices. Location: The hotel itself is a 10-15 minute walk to Stratford Underground station, which provides easy access into central London via the Central or Jubilee lines. Nearby, are various shops, takeaways, two supermarkets, a few cheap to mid-range restaurants and a cinema complex. The immediate area surrounding the hotel never got too loud; for the three nights we stayed there, I managed to sleep well and felt safe throughout. The rooms: The rooms were small but cosy. The bathroom was narrow but long, and the shower was fantastic, I never wanted to get out! I was impressed by the cleanliness of the rooms, the maids cleaned it every day, usually only when we were out, so we were never woken up or disturbed by them. The bed was reasonably comfy, although an additional pillow would have been nice. The tea and coffee making facilities were good, and were replenished daily. The electricity in each room is switched on via a card which is attached to the room key. All of the facilities were operational except for the fan, which would have been useful during the warmer evenings. Breakfast: The breakfast was rather basic, and consisted of watered down orange juice, water, tea, coffee a choice of two cereals (rice crispies and corn flakes), slices of bread (which could be toasted) and slices of cheap cooked meats and cheese. For the price we paid, it wasn't that bad, but after staying in similarly priced hotels in France and Germany, the choice and quality could be improved. In summary, the hotel was good value for money, and I'd definitely recommend it for anyone looking for a basic and modern hotel away (but not too far from) the hustle and bustle of central London.", "Date": "June 18, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "1", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Madrid", "Title": "\u201cGood price, bad service and location\u201d", "Author": "chamdo", "ReviewID": "UR28149728", "Content": "I booked this hotel for the price and proximity to London. It's in a suburb called Stratford, which is good for finding cheap local food and supermarkets, but it takes a while to get into the city if you're there to see the sights. It's a 15-20 minute walk to the Stratford tube stop, in zone 3 of the tube network, and from there it takes 25-40 minutes to get into the center, depending partially on whether service on any of the lines was interrupted (which seemed to happen pretty often). Also, be aware that over half the rooms are motel-style, and they're currently doing renovations, so if you end up with an outside room you're likely to be woken at 7 or 8 am every morning like we were. The rooms were clean and comfortable, but small; the bathroom was tiny (the door nearly hit the sink when it was opened). Breakfast isn't bad; typical continental European - cereals, milk, tea, coffee, bread, meats and cheeses. The man who seemed to be the manager was awful. The first morning at breakfast, he yelled at one of the maids and threatened to fire her. They were in the kitchen, but both clearly visible to me and just a few feet away, since I was getting cereal at the time. He definitely knew I was there.
