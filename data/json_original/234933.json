It is built around a small courtyard which I'm sure is very pleasant to breakfast in during warmer weather. The reception/breakfast area has a certain rock music vibe to it as the hotel appears to cater for a lot of passing musicians playing the nearby Magnet or Knaack clubs. During our stay, reception staff were super-friendly and gave us Berlin virgins plenty of advice! I have to say that this friendliness extended to all of the locals we came across in the east of the city (I've never met nicer people on my travels). Both rooms were perfectly sized, pleasant ,and clean, with good bathrooms. Breakfast is an extra 7.50 euros but well worth it , and it is served until midday (a real bonus given that Berlin bars don't seem to close!).

I would really like to leave a positive review for this hotel, as the staff were very nice, and the room was pretty good, clean, comfy, quiet, etc. (Room 31 3rd floor) Unfortunately I have given the hotel a neutral/average rating, as its location really lets it down. It was quite a novelty to stay in East Berlin, and yes I felt pretty safe walking around with my boyfriend. But the depressing communist air is still very prominent in the East. There are no shopping/decent restaurants/etc in the area, only a few small off licences and some turkish fast food donner establishments. There is a tram stop right outside the hotel. I can't remember what is was called, but it is after Alexanderplaza and before the first greifswald street stop. Don't stay on till griefswald, you'll go too far! Basically after alexanderplaza keep your eyes open you'll see the green hotel awning and know to get off. Unfortunately for us, there was a transport strike on, so we had to walk everyday to Alexanderplaza to get an S train. It was about a 15 minute walk, not inspiring, very concrete massive wide roads. A taxi to Ostbanhoff (East Berlin station) was E7.80. We had breakfast both days, it was ok, I can't see why others are raving about it though, it is an extra E7.50 each per day. It has 3 varieties of muesli, milk, orange juice, and lots of cold salami/ham/cheese and fruit platters. There was also scrambled eggs on a hot plate covered which was not hot on either days, I still had them both days, on toast, but they were cold. There was also 3 types of bread available to toast. Good coffee and tea brought to your table as well. As I said, it was ok, I think it was worth the E7.50 as there is not places nearby to eat, and you can have a really big bowl of muesli and toast, etc. Overall it was a colorful experience staying here, as we felt like we saw communist berlin, but be sure the tram is running and you don't mind the ride in and out of town, as all Berlin tourist stuff is a tram ride away. Think about getting a city card from the train stations, it was 15.50E for 48 hours, unlimited zone a and b travel, and discounts at some tourist places, we didn't get the full worth as only limited transport available due to the strike, but there you go. We would not recommend this hotel to any tourists wanting to visit Berlin unless they were on a strict budget, or didn't mind the tram travel (check first!!), We would like to stress though that the hotel itself was comfortable and the staff very nice. There you go, hope this helps you make a decision....if it is only 10-20euros more to stay in West Berlin, my partner and I would pay the extra next time if we went back to Berlin. PS Check out the Zur Leztzen Instanz traditional pub in East Berlin, station stop Jerbowiz after Alexanderplatza, address 14-16 Weisserstraza (sp!) it was a nice typical hearty German meal! On a side street by a church, not touristy at all, looked like only locals knew about it, Very nice.

After the most amazing breakfast I could have dreamed off (eggs, bacon, cheese, ham, cereal, toast, you name I ate it, fresh fruit the works!!!!!) we set off. Due to the immense breakfast, no lunch was needed, just some fruit from the several 100 stand around the city. When we returned late at nigh, we could grab a couple of beers from the off licence round the corner and enjoy them sat in the peaceful courtyard. As we were out early and in late (with a quick stop off in the afternoon) the hotel is a stone throws away from the city centre, a couple of stops on the tram.

A massive choice of everything from fruit to scrambled egg, fresh orange juice and coffee really set you up for the day. The hotel is in a pretty good position on the M4 tram route into Alexanderplatz (buy a ticket on the tram with coins -5.80 euros for a day ticket) and from there it's a pleasant walk along Unter Den Linden to the museums and Art Galleries along with the Brandenburg Tor. There are a large number of nearby restaurants all of which were good value for money and provided a lot of choice. The area is also the focus of a lively arts scene at the local Culture Brewery Arts Centre. There is a lot to do and see in the Eastern side of Berlin- such that we rarely ventured ' over there' (to the West - as the locals refer to it despite the wall having come down in 1989). There is a lot of history deeply relevant to our times dotted all around within walking distance of the hotel. This part of Berlin is cheap and that should temper expectations, but even so standards are not bad and considerably better than you would find in a UK city of equivalent size.
