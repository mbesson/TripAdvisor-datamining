I was disappointed as the hotel was very easy to locate and right next door to a Mcdonalds, handy as it was open 24hrs. Staff were very friendly and always happy to help regarless of the issue or time of day. I was lucky enough to be upgraded to delux room. Room was clean and modern however a tad small, but given it's HKG, you can't complain! And I was traveling alone, so I didn't mind this. I had a great view and free wifi, bonus when you want to get in touch with family back home for free!!! Shower was great, nepresso coffee machine in the room ready for you to use. If traveling with a large family the deluxe room will not be suitable, not sure what else they offer for larger bookings however location is excellent!!! And it's clean and tidy with free wifi!! Well done! Yes I will go back:-)", "Date": "September 7, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel great location\u201d", "Author": "Jameslovely", "ReviewID": "UR138168284", "Content": "My wife and I stayed this hotel for 2 nights and we found it's quite a good choice for us as usually when we travel we like going out to explore the city and try to do what locals do. We ate local food and we did a lot of shopping in nearby causeway bay. \u00a0MRT is very close and it's very easy to get to central area too.\u00a0 The hotel itself is great. \u00a0It provides free wifi which wins us over. Staff are responsive and polite. The loval beef noodle place they recommeded is fantastic. We had that for two times. \u00a0 The room is cozy and the shower is great. TV is big although we didn't use much.\u00a0 Overall we think the hotel is warm and not pretentious at all. We definitely come back in later this year!", "Date": "August 24, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cFabulous hotel - no regret\u201d", "Author": "Bellinij", "ReviewID": "UR138011054", "Content": "We stayed this hotel for 3 nights and we love this hotel very much - staff is nice and always being helpful. Whether we asked about direction or restaurant recommendations they'd explained very clearly. The hotel has some handwritten calligrahy on wall as decoration - it's very thoughtful and special. The room is cozy and comfotable. Our room actually had a bit harbour view which is quite nice. Overall this hotel is value for money. Train station is nearby, very convenient.

Here are the good points... 1. The hotel is three short blocks from the Tin Hau station/airport bus station and one block from the tram. 2. It has nearly all the necessary amenities, except cottonbuds 3. everything is new. 4. nice 40 in LCD tv, cold aircon, hot water... check 5. the staff was very helpful, spoke good english and entertained every request we made, even gave us an upgrade. However, there are some things I found to be lacking... 1. Twice, we took taxis to the hotel, but the taxi drivers do not know where the hotel was. the taxi driver even took us to another butterfly (morrison) and argued with us that there was no such hotel as butterfly in victoria. As a result, our taxi bills increased by over $HK70 per trip. 2. The free wi-fi was inconsistent. it would work one minute and cut off the next. 3. The room looked clean but was actually dusty... really dusty. 4. no cottonbuds... One last thing, the restaurant beside the hotel (dragon palace) is overpriced and the food is not so good. in otherwords, it sucked. there are lots of other cheaper restaurants in the area.

Anyhow, will do next time. The hotel is walking distance to Tinhau MRT, which is fine as the taxi driver never heard about the place and had to call to ask for exact location. Front office staff are helpful and enthusiastic, they are trying hard. However, the room was not super clean: the carpet looks like it was vacuumed 3 days ago, there was a long black hair on the shower mat. The string of the blinds was broken...cannot close it completely. The shower exhaust fan is constantly on, which is really annoying to sleep... I had no space to put my suitcase, the room is very small, so I just left it open on the floor...not so great... Free wifi internet is good, plus their guest directory has the look of a small ipad, which is cute and fun too. I am not sure how much you need to pay to have that great harbourview room om their website, what I had on the 8th floor was some amazing views of the buildings opposite...", "Date": "August 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cNeed to tell customers if you are not open for business!!!\u201d", "Author": "Classybabe99", "ReviewID": "UR132438330", "Content": "I booked my reservation in March for a late June, early July stay. The only reason I found out it was not yet opened was because I came on here to look for a review since I knew it was a brand new hotel. When I found out it wasn't going to be opened, I contacted them to find out whether my stay will be affected. They didn't have a definite date of opening but promised to let me know with plenty of notice. It is now less than a week before I leave, and I had to contact them myself once again. Still not open, and still not doing the right thing. Traveling is stressful enough--why add to it by keeping customers in the dark? They have four other properties, so it's not like they don't have an easy solution for every customer that has the same problem.

By the way, I already bought hotel voucher for 2 rooms, back in May, for June 20 arrival date / check-in (for 3 nights stay) in Butterfly, Victoria.

Now today, I just checked again and found out that Butterfly Victoria opening will be delayed and surprisingly there is no notification to me at all.
