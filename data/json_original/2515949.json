We had an urban suite, which was plenty of room. - a bedroom with large TV and sitting room with another large TV. The rooms were clean. The location is great - just down the road from the cable car tunaround and if you want to go to Fishernans Wharf its just a streetcar ride away.

It was one of the best decisions I've ever made to stay here. Right in the middle of all shopping and the cable car that takes you to Fisherman's Wharf. Staff were spectacular and super helpful. I got there right in the middle of rain, and of course, forgot my umbrella. The staff were in tune with this, and were able to point me in the direction of the closest store with umbrellas so I wouldn't get too wet (not that this was hard since the hotel is next to everything shopping!) I chose a room facing the street, which yes, there was some noise, as I was warned. But after living in many cities, the noise was not unreasonable. If you are not used to city life, do not choose a room facing the street. The room was small, but comfy. The king bed was soft, and inviting. The bathroom redone to a modern taste. My only complaint was that there was not enough counter/shelf space for my toiletries around the sink. There is free wifi, and every outlet you could possibly need for all your electronics. There was also an ipod dock for your alarm. Each afternoon, there is a \"cocktail\" waiting for you at the end of the front desk. On the weekend, it was a true cocktail. On the weekdays, just a nice fruity pick me up. Oh, and if you have the chance to have the continental breakfast included in the room, don't bother. I went the first day, and it was a croissant with a small cup of fruit, juice or coffee. Not much. I'd probably go to the Subway next door and get one of their breakfast sandwiches. Overall, I'd definitely stay there again when I go to SF again. It's around the corner from the cable car stop, and right next to the BART.

I had a very pleasant stay and would recommend this hotel highly to visitors to San Francisco. First of all, the hotel has probably the most central and convenient location in San Francisco. Walk a block south and you're at the busy Powell Street-Market Street intersection. This area is a shopping and public transport hub for the city - there's a MUNI booth where you can buy public transport tickets, the main cable car stop for cable cars going north to Fisherman's Wharf and the Powell Street BART Station (where you can catch trains to and from San Francisco International Airport). A couple of blocks north and you're in the Union Square shopping and dining area. The hotel is boutique-style with 91 rooms. It's in a historic building (I'd say built around 1900-1920) which was totally modernized and renovated in 2008. The renovation is impressive - the hotel throughout is clean, fresh and slick with an attractive orange, grey and black themed decor. I particularly liked the gas fireplace area in the lobby - very enticing to lounge about in a San Francisco winter! I paid around $110 per night (it was a holiday special) and for that price, I was expecting a fairly nondescript convention-style hotel. To my surprise, however, my room was of a standard I would have expected to find in a much more expensive and luxurious hotel. My room was thoughtfully laid out to make the most of the space (it didn't feel cramped). It had an iPod player and radio (a bit fiddly to use though) on the bedside table and, best of all, a 42 inch wall-mounted LCD TV. A TV this large was a real treat and a credit to the hotel - far more expensive hotels I've stayed in have a 32 inch TV at best. The bathroom was spacious and looked very new and fresh. One delight was the L'Occitane toiletries - again a brand that would be at home in a more expensive hotel. The in-room WiFi was free, fast and worked well. The only negative about the room is that there was no climate control system in the room, only a window-mounted dual heating/air-conditioning unit. This worked well enough, but took a while to heat the room up on a cold San Francisco winter morning. Overall, though, my room was a pleasure to stay in. The hotel has a young staff who were warm and friendly. When I checked in, I was made to feel welcome and given a choice of rooms (one more spacious, but facing the street and therefore noisier, and one facing the inner courtyard and quieter but a bit smaller). I'm an independent sort of traveller so didn't need their assistance much but the queries I did have were handled promptly, professionally and with a smile.", "Date": "February 25, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Durham, North Carolina", "Title": "\u201cFriendly staff, convenient location\u201d", "Author": "kkbrig", "ReviewID": "UR124966696", "Content": "My husband and 2 daughters stayed at the Hotel Abri Feb. 7-12.

Two robes were hanging in the closet for guests to use. The bathroom was clean and had plenty of room to store personal items. The room was very quiet because it was an interior room. I would recommend this as opposed to a room facing the street. I have stayed in this area on previous visits at other hotels that had rooms facing the street. The noise can be very overwhelming, especially in older hotels. There was complementary coffee in the lobby downstairs along w/ local newspapers. The restaurant adjacent to the hotel is very good. I did not eat there on this visit, but I have eaten there before and the food was good. After shopping and a nice lunch, we headed back to our hotel room for a little R&R.

Another bonus was the staff accomodated a late 2pm check-out for us(at no charge) so that was really great. More time to rest in their cozy beds.

If you've already committed to spend SF hotel money to stay near attractions, this isn't a bad spend. Pros: location - the Powell St. cable car ends two blocks away from you on the opposite corner of the block of buildings you would be in. Theaters and museums are mere blocks away. Bed - my goodness was this bed comfortable. I don't sleep well on most hotel mattresses, but I did here - which is good because I was here for a week! Wifi - complimentary and pretty good from my room. They have accessible rooms - which oddly enough I got, though I don't need it. Refrigerator in the room! Victory for me. I have medical needs for one, hate shelling out extra, and it is also convenient for keeping fresh fruit and other items cool so I don't have to shell out for the overpriced, less-than-great breakfasts nearby. Individual climate control - it does actually get hot in SF on occasion. The air conditioning did its job. Cons: location - there is a nightclub across the street and these windows don't appear to be double-glazed! They DO have ear plugs in the rooms and I was asked at check in if I needed a street-side or interior room. I was not facing the nightclub, but still got noise when the restaurant downstairs took out the trash at late/early hours. Age. This property IS renovated, but its age shows in spots, like in the wiring that's on the wall instead of behind it and closets that are ridiculously small. Air conditioning is by unit in the window. Some people don't like this (I do). Housekeeping: they didn't seem to want to replace things in the bathroom (i.e. washcloths, not soap) and the toilets are dual flush. Even full flush doesn't... um... always do the job. Ahem. Also, the panhandlers will be waiting for you. Don't head west on some of the nearby streets (esp Eddy). That is the Tenderloin. If you are looking for what the Tenderloin has to offer, well, then go ahead. The list of cons is longer, but I find fault easily - take it for what its worth.

Everything about this hotel, from its prime location, to the intricate detailing and personal service, assure an exclusive experience of comfort and satisfaction. This hotel is completely and unpretentiously classy. It is an establishment knowingly providing personalised service and comfort to all guests. The Hotel Abri has been awarded a three and a half star rating, however this is indeed no reflection on the level of comfort and service provided, from check-in to check-out, and at all times between. When making a reservation, I often contact the hotel prior to my stay in order to make requests, ranging from high floor to quiet room location. On this occasion, my request was for the both of these, and I was very surprised to have been provided with a room that met these criteria. Check in was immediate, with no line to wait in. I was courteously checked in to my room by Tyler, who greeted me and offered his services during my stay. As mentioned, all members of staff are personable, and very approachable. I only had one other encounter with a member of staff: Jonathan, who followed through with my request almost immediately, and followed up with a call to ensure my request was taken care of. A few things worth noting are that the rooms are quite small, however this is commonplace in San Francisco, particularly the rooms being that of an older building. That being said, the room has been designed well, and there is sufficient room to move about as freely as required. Other (very minor and petty) points worth mentioning are that the showerhead was positioned at an uncomfortable angle, and the coffee was not replenished for the coffee machine throughout my entire four night stay. The lifts were also a little slow, but none of these points bothered me at all, really. It just may be worth mentioning for the benefit of others. I am not difficult to please, however when reviewing hotels, I always offer the rating that I would provide the hotel as an official rating. This hotel comes very close to the full five stars (I would award four and a half stars, given the opportunity, however this is not possible), even considering the fact that there lacks services common to establishments of such rating, such as a gym, spa or 24 hour room service. This is possibly as close to the full five stars that I have ever been, and this is comparing a three and a half star hotel, to many hotels that have been awarded a five star rating. It is for this reason that I will only choose The Hotel Abri when venturing to San Francisco. This way, I can be guaranteed a comfortable and unique experience; not simply a \u201cstay\u201d.", "Date": "May 31, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Orange County, CA", "Title": "\u201cCharming and full of luxurious ammenities\u201d", "Author": "chicago2socal", "ReviewID": "UR110303867", "Content": "This was my first visit to a Larkspur hotel in San Francisco and the Abri.

Not being an overly critical guest after staying in hotels for well over fifty years, I found the Abri very acceptable.

This is a big winner for me every time! The Abri fit all my requirements as to location, cleanliness, and room function. Upon checking in I was advised that if the street noise was a problem I could change to a rear facing room. Although the street facing room was much larger, I decided that the garbage collection trucks at 3:30 AM did not work for me. My new room was perfect: but small. If you want to be in the heart of things (many do not) this is the place to stay, especially if you are on a limited hotel budget. I like city buzz and a quick walk to 24 hour bacon and eggs if the mood strikes. Be advised that San Francisco has a generous population of people who's main source of living is asking passers by for handouts. Know this in advance and try to go with that bit of SF \"color\". This city is one of the most beautiful on the planet so also be prepared for that if you have not been here before. Bring a warm jacket no matter the time of year you arrive.

I frequent San Francisco a few times every couple of years, so I enjoy being able to stay at different hotels, but this to me was an overall disappointment. I will start by saying that yes, the location of the hotel is great, but there are a lot of other \"true\" 5 star hotels that have great locations as well. The rooms themselves are quite small and had I been staying any longer, or travelling with luggage (I just had carry-on) I would have found the space to have been much too cramped. The room I received was facing the inside courtyard, so there was no obvious street noise which was nice, BUT, the rooms are not sound proofed at all! You can clearly hear doors shutting to other rooms, TV's in adjacent rooms, conversations as people passed by your door...If you're a light sleeper, good luck. The overall quality of the room wasn't much better either. It looked more like a cover up job, than a remodelling job. The door to the bathroom had chips and scratches all over it, the baseboards were cracked and had visible marks all over them, they had forgot to sand before patching something in the ceiling, the window sills were filthy and showing their age...Like I said before, not a 5 star. The front desk staff were pleasant, but had there issues as well. It is difficult to hail a cab from this particular hotel. The bellman/front desk agent actually gave up when I was trying to get a cab to go to AT&T park and referred me to the hotel across the road. I also requested a wake-up call on my last morning, and they completely forgot.

In the end we weren't really bothered by the noise & my husband liked the fact he could see the street and everyone going out on NYE from our window. What we were the most disappointed about was that when we wanted to check out the next morning & called down for our car (which we had valet parked - and were charged more for an \"oversized\" vehicle when it's really not that big) we were told that it would be 40 minutes or more to retreive our car. I realize that it was New Years Day, and everyone was checking out, but that seems odd to me. You know you're going to be busy so staff appropriately, don't be surprised when everyone \"wants their car at the same time.\" You do afterall have a checkout time.

The Abri could improve by offering a continental breakfast. They only offer tea and coffee.

The first week's stay was qiuet and uneventful and the staff is friendly. In San Francisco yo should not expect very large room sizes and you do not get one at the Hotel Abri. It is small, but comfortable enough. This week I stayed there again and things tun a bad turn. I am not saying that it is the hotel's fault, but after going to bed at 11 pm, I was awakened at 2:15 in the morning by loud talk and even shouting in the hallway outside my room. I was literally startled awake. I opened the door and asked the 2 men outside to please be quiet, I was rudely cussed at by one of them. I siad I was going to call security and he dared me to and threatened me. I closed the door and called the front desk. Here is where the hotel has to accept responsibility. The front deak person could have cared less. I asked for them to send up security and he said they didn;t have any and that he would call the police. I said yes please do so as the two men had entered the room next to me and were carrying on and partying very loudly, with knocks at their door from other men and a lot of shouting and drunken, foul language coming through the walls and door. Meanwhile, nothing from the hotel, no police, nothing. I was kept awake until 4 in the morning.

The bellman and Jonathan was very nice. That being said, I took the advice of the other contributors from TripAdvisor and decided we would try out the Hotel Abri for our stay in San Francisco. The lobby was beautiful. The had gutted it and completely redone the lobby. It was sleeky, modern and gorgeous. They had decided not to continue this motif beyond that. We stepped off the elevator and I physically hesitated. It was a long creepy dim hallway to our room. The first room we were in was a decent size but it was only because it was the ADA handicap room. There was a very loud humming/buzzing sound eminating from the room. A fire truck went by and we had to stop our conversation otherwise we couldn't hear what the other was saying. And what we were saying was that the room was dark and creepy. Instead of gutting the room and redoing it, like the lobby, they just threw a thick coat of paint over everything. The door, which was probably older than I am, creaked when it opened in a 1920's farmhouse way. There was no light in the closet. In fact there was only one dim light on the ceiling and the lamp at the desk. The wires from the switch ran along the wall up to the light. They just painted over the wires instead of running it inside the wall. It looked dangerous! Jonathan called to make sure everything was ok and we said it wasn't. He said he was happy to move us. So we went to the room down the hall. It was about a 3rd of the size with all the same \"creepy\" amenities. Jonathan called again and I told him I didn't think this was a King room. He said we were right but there weren't any other rooms available but was happy to reduce our rate by $20 a night. Are you freakin kidding me? For a room a third of the size and a smaller bed? BTW - Did I mention it was $53 a day to park our car?!? My husband and I decided we were going to leave. We were just not comfortable in the room, especially what we paid for it! We told Jonathan of our decision and while we called around to try and find another place. They did agree to not charge us for the one night room for changing our minds. I was very dissapointed with this hotel. I know that the Larkspur hotels are usually very nice and luxurious but they just cheaped out on this one. Instead of completely gutting it and redoing it, like the lobby, they just threw a coat of paitn over everything and put some high end lotions in the bathroom. This does not make for a luxury hotel.

When we arrived we asked for an upgraded room but none were available for two days. We hunkered down in a very small interior room; if we\u2019d been visiting for a few days it would have been sufficient but as we were there for a week there wasn\u2019t even room to open our suitcases. There\u2019s no view from these interior rooms but at least it\u2019s quiet and a good sleep was the priority. They hotel moved us to a new room two days later; strangely it was the exact same room in a different part of the building. There seemed to have been some mix-up regarding why we wanted a new room but they quickly resolved that and relocated us again. From 414 to 404 and finally to room 203 where we stayed for the final 5 days of our trip. 203 is a wheelchair accessible room with plenty of space and afforded us room to open our suitcases and keep them open. The staff was fantastic and I\u2019d recommend the hotel for that alone. It\u2019s a small hotel so when you came in after a day of adventure or when you left in the morning you were greeted by familiar faces. I appreciate that when renovating the hotel they maintained much of the original infrastructure. The moldings around the doors for example are caked with a century of paint which I think adds to the charm and history of the property. The only major issue was the internet. On their website they say it\u2019s complimentary and it was one of the reasons we booked with them; internet should be free in a hotel just as TVs are. Unfortunately after three days of phoning tech support, the front desk, and talking with various staff, the problem was not resolved. Neither my iPhone or iPad would connect to WIFI and having come from Canada I didn\u2019t have 3G service. Thankfully there\u2019s free WIFI that works perfectly a few doors down at the Starbucks. If you\u2019re a business traveler who requires internet often and wants to have it in the comfort of your room rather that in the very public business center (also complimentary) I\u2019d recommend against staying here. I realize that the Abri doesn\u2019t have tech staff and that this area of customer service is contracted out but the people who they\u2019ve contracted need training and need to update their infrastructure. They finally told me that the iPad and iPhone aren\u2019t supported. This seems crazy; both of these devices strictly adhere to wireless standards and moreover, work with every other WIFI hotspot I\u2019ve ever tried. Long story short, the complimentary internet didn\u2019t work as advertised. To be fair, had I brought a computer there is a physical Ethernet port in the room as well which we may have had more success with. There are so many great places to stay in San Francisco that I would likely try somewhere else on a return visit. The inability to resolve our internet issues in the seven days we were there was a real let down. Internet aside, the staff are lovely, the rooms are clean and well appointed (though tiny), and the place simply has a nice vibe.

We had one of those rooms and requested a change to an inside room the next day. We got an immediate room change with a smile. I read about the front rooms in a TripAdvisor review, so I knew what to expect. If we did not get a room change at least the noise would not have been a surprise. And it was not so very bad that we could not have tolerated it if necessary. Tips We rented a car for two days and went to all the places that were too far to walk to. We drove to several wineries in Nappa Valley, the Golden Gate Bridge, Pier 39, Sausalito, down Lombard Street, world\u2019s most crooked street and many other places with the GPS we brought along. The best part of our trip was visiting Sam\u2019s Chowder Mobile near the Japanese Tea Garden in Golden Gate State Park. Their famous clam chowder and lobster rolls were so good that we drove to their restaurant (Sam\u2019s Chowder House ( 4210 Cabrillo Highway North, Half Moon Bay, CA 94019-5221, for lunch two days later. It was worth the long scenic drive. Scoma's Restaurant at Fisherman's Wharf was superb!! Probably the best on the Wharf. We rented a Toyota Corolla for 2 days for about $80.00 total from Reliable Rental Car Company just a few blocks away at 349 Mason St. If we had read the reviews on this company we probably would not have rented from them, but we did a walk-in, got a decent car and had no problems. They were very nice and accommodating. The great thing about that company was that they allow you to park in their garage just two short blocks from Hotel Abri. Parking in that area is generally $35-$45 per night, so free parking was really good. With the price of parking in the area it\u2019s like we got the car for free.

They also provide very nice complimentary toiletries by L'Occitane. We were in a double room the first night and it was a bit tight. That room also faced the street and the club across the street so it was a bit noisy at night. We closed the windows and still couldn't drown out the sound. The hotel upgraded us to a suite the second night. The suites have a common area with a large flat screen TV, mini-fridge, and a pull-out sofabed. There is a separate bedroom and the bathroom is connected to the bedroom so you have to walk through the bedroom to use the restroom. One odd thing about the restroom is that they have an opaque glass door so you can kind of see into the restroom, especially if the restroom light is on and the bedroom light is off. Location: The hotel is a couple of blocks from Union Square, the Westfield shopping center, and close to the Powell Street BART station so it is really easy to get to/from the airport and around the city. Relatively near the Tenderloin area so you may see some bums if you wander in the wrong direction but we didn't have any problems. There is a Walgreens nearby for anything you might need and there is a Subway and Cold Stone right next door (but I recommend getting frozen yogurt from Blondie's around the corner instead). We didn't have a car but I think parking is about $25/night. Service: Staff is great.

The concierge, Hillary, was extremely helpful with booking transportation, tours, special arrangements, anything I asked. And the doormen/bellmen went above and beyond and make it a point to remember you by name. They all make an effort to be the best and it shows. And they have FREE Wi-Fi.....they get big points for that alone! The location was perfect, trolley, cable car turnaround, and BART are all literally around the corner. There is plenty of shopping and restaurants within walking distance and a Walgreen's right around the corner for all those essentials you may have forgotten. There is an italian restaurant attached but we did not get a chance to eat there, although it smelled great and looked to be pretty full every night so that's a good sign. A BIG factor for me in reviewing a hotel is whether or not the beds are comfortable. If you've ever had an uncomfortable bed you know it can ruin a vacation. The beds here are outstanding in my opinion. Very comfortable and cozy. I gave the room 4 out of 5 because there were a few minor things I thought were lacking, such as no mirror outside the bathroom, and no full length mirror, and the towels, while they looked to be new, were not very soft. Also, we like it very cold when we sleep and the window AC unit struggled at times, but it did an ok job, it's not like it was hot outside so it was still comfortable. These are extremely minor things and it would not deter me from staying there again. I just feel there is a little room for improvement. Overall, for the price we paid we felt we got an amazing experience at Hotel Abri and would highly recommend it to anyone looking to stay in the Union Sq. area.

One evening we bought ice cream at a nearby shop and just people-watched by the cable car turnaround for 20 minutes or so while licking our cones.Great show!

Here are a few things that might help if you are considering this hotel. Getting there: We flew in to SFO and simply hopped on the BART (Bay Area Rapid Transport) which takes you straight into the city. Hotel Abri is just around the corner from Powell St station, we were jet lagged this was a god send just how easy it was to find and the BART is by far the cheapest option to get to and from the Airport. The cable car line turnaround is at the end of the street and the the street car/tram/trolley whatever you want to call them right behind that. Transport was a breeze. There is a booth near the Cable Car turnaround where you can get a daily transport passport giving you unlimited rides on all the buses cable cars and street cars for 11 bucks. Hotel Check-in/staff: The staff were absolutley fantastic. Hillary the concierge was fantastic, its not often that you there service is so good that you can remember the persons name. There was a problem with our airport connection (we had a really early flight out ) and when they contacted the hotel through the night she rebooked our transfer for us so as not to disturb us. Housekeeping left the room spotless. The hotel is definitely well run. Amenities: No Gym or Pool but this didnt worry us at all there, is an adjoining italian restaurant which was delicious. Complimentary internet/PC use was so helpful. In room safe (many hotels are reverting to only having deposit boxes at reception - worth checking). Everything in this hotel was new - nothing dodgy at all. Room: The king size bed was divine, decent linen, funishings were new with a decent size bathroom - (Loccitane products). Room wasnt large but this is usual in nearly all the San Fran hotels I've stayed in. If you are a light sleeper they also have an inside room option it was nice to open up the window and watch the world go by outside. Noise: The hotel is away from the cable car line however there is a nightclub just across the road, and it did get a bit noisier on Saturday night, not from music but people out on the street. If you are a light sleeper take your earplugs or request an inside room. Shopping : Westfield San Francisco Centre is a minute away and union Square is just up the hill. No shortage of options at all. Food Options: EVERYWHERE catering to every budget, theres a cold rock ice-creamery next door too. yum. If you are looking for a nice place for lunch on a sunny day the I recommend the Cheesecake Factory on top of the Macy's building, it has an outdoor seating area looking down into the square. Great location. The hotel has a breakfast listing of the best places nearby to head out for breakfast - We went to a place a few blocks away called Dotties - food was delicious but get there early we were there before it opened on Saturday and there was already a line. The place is small and cosy but well worth a visit.

The only downside to the location of this hotel (and it really is only a minor point) is that there are a few beggars around and about but I have to say that we were never bothered by them and some are extremely talented musicians who helped to while away the time when waiting for the cable cars!

We can't say enough about the location as we took BART (Bay Area Rapid Transit) from the airport for about $5 each and came out 1 block from the hotel at the Powell Street station.

The only thing missing was juice and/or water as there was nothing for non-coffee/tea drinkers. The complimentary evening wine was either red or white along with some type of bread. The room that we had was a Deluxe King facing a wall but was very quiet yet near the elevator. Since the hotel is on a busy street, I think that we benefited facing the wall. We still had three windows that let daylight in. The room itself was spacious and tastefully decorated with: a king bed, desk, two arm chairs and a small fridge. The bathroom was a decent size with a shower only. The free wireless internet and free lobby internet station allowed us to keep in touch and check-in for our return flight right from the hotel.

I demanded to know why they had chosen to not disclose this to us so that we could get it fixed. They at first lied that they didn't know, but after the garage person said they had been notified, the desk lady changed her mind. When the front desk manager arrived, I asked him to refund us our stay because of the hassle this was causing us. It took me over 2 hours of arguing with him to even agree to refund one day. I am still in the process of getting the 2nd day refunded. The desk clerk reminded us that she had offered us a solution. The only solution she offered was to bring our vehicle with a broken window. It took them 5 hours to get our van fixed while my family waited in the lobby. They never once apologized until I told them that they had not apologized. I also said they could at least offer my children a drink. They never did. The parking garage manager actually wound up buying lunch for my family while the hotel only proceeded to make excuses and blame and deny that they did anything wrong.

From the way that the Inn tried to advertise itself online, the facility and service just not up to the expectation yet. Working at the Front desk, you need to have the ability to read guest's mind, for example: when see a guest who is tall and big, you should instant figure out that a handicape room with a double bed just wouldn't work. It's all about the details, and how you judge the situation. Anyways, I will still recommand it to others because the price is reasonable and the location is really great.

We booked a non-smoking room with 2 king beds online throught the Monticello/Kimpton website with no problem. The location was great. Right in Union Square, it was within easy walking distance of shopping and cable cars. Although we had a car, we could have easily used public transportation anywhere since it seems that most lines cross through Union Sq. The room was very nice. Despite the building's age, the hotel is well kept and clean, with comfortable beds and pillows. I was relieved that the room did not, in fact, smell of smoke at all (being a non-smoking room I expected that, but I'd been rudely surprised before). The bathrooms are small, but how big does a bathroom need to be? They had dispensers instead of bottles (supposedly to avoid the waste caused by amenity packaging) for hand soap, lotion, shampoo, conditioner and shower gel. My only real complaint about the bathroom is the shower head was not very good Since we did had a car, we opted for the parking package which included valet parking in the price of the stay. Although we did have some trouble due to some miscommunication between the front desk and the parking garage, it was convinient to not have to look for parking every night. The downside to this is if you leave something in your car, you need to have them bring the car back up from the garage in order to get it. The staff were all very friendly and always offered directions when we took the car out. Unfortunately the continental breakfast was $6 per person, but the staff gave us very good recommendations for nearby breakfast places. Overall it was a pleasant stay, and since we could walk to so many places we felt that we got a much better idea of what the city is actually like rather than just hitting the tourist hot spots.", "Date": "August 30, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Glasgow, Scotland", "Title": "\u201cGreat time at the Monticello\u201d", "Author": "Fatbhoy", "ReviewID": "UR5410183", "Content": "We spent 3 nights at the Monticello Inn and found it to be in a fantasic position, ideal for shopping, entertainment and transport links being a minutes walk from the bart station and the cable car turnaround.

You can't beat the location... on the corner of Ellis and Powell which is literally a 30 sec walk to the cable cars (which are $5 per trip). The old-fashioned trolley cars are around the corner also a must and much cheaper at $1.50 (which includes a transfer good on any lines for 3 hrs). The staff at the hotel were extremely friendly and helpful (especially when we had to extend our stay by one night due to my fiance getting food poisioning). And the hotel was suprisingly quite, even though we were right in the heart of the city. Ask for a courtyard room if you can, we had one the first night and it was great. No noise at all, but you do lose out on any view. The only problem with the rooms was the size... but it is a boutique hotel. Another perk of the hotel is their complimentary wine-tasting every night from 5-6. The best part is you are able to take it with you to your room to sip while watching the early news! As for their contential breakfast at $6.00 - not really worth it as there are tons of bakerys and coffee shops in the neighbourhood where you can get the same stuff for half the price.

I arrived with my three 50+ pound dogs - no problem. At check-in the clerk even offered a free upgrade to a suite so that I could have more room for the dogs. Incredible; very appreciated. The suite was spacious, nicely decorated, very clean. After reading reviews here I requested an inside room and it was nice and quiet though the view is of the air vents. Staff was very friendly and always greeted my dogs as well as me. Continental breakfast in the morning for $6.50 is a true \"continental\" - just coffee, juice, muffins and fruit.

The only problem (and I can't say that it was an insignificant one) that we had with our room was street noise. We were on the second floor (the only pet friendly floor) and the noise was pretty bad. Being near an intersection, we heard a lot of sirens and brakes squealing. Every morning around 3 a.m., the street sweepers and trash trucks came through. The staff was apologetic and we realized, of course, that it was out of their control. They could not move us to another floor because of the dog and all of the inside rooms were already booked, so we made the best of it.
